{"text":"Everything we've had has been tasty and fresh. We love Totties! Their pad thai and curry dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"Great Thai offerings.  Get the Tottie spring rolls.  Four tasty rolls that you roll in fresh lettuce, cilantro and mint. Good to share for a couple.  Dinner after that will fill you up. Wonderful Asian decore and pretty decent, but not great service."}
{"text":"Food was soooo good!  Best Thai food I've had in so long!  We ordered tom yum, basil beef, green curry, beef pho, pad Thai, bok choy, eggplant and string beans. Everything was delicious. The food was spicier than I've had in other places but so good, almost addictive."}
{"text":"The best thai food in town. Fresh, quality ingredients. Food takes a little time but is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is good.  The reason for not giving them more stars is the consistently SLOOOOW service.  I keep going back because the food is so good.  But even when they are not busy and I am the only one in the place it takes a long time for someone to take my order.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Pad Kee Mao.  Try it.  It's great!"}
{"text":"This rating is specific to the take-out beef pho. The broth was average (probably the equivalent you'd get in a can from the grocery store's ethnic foods aisle). The meat was severely lacking for $12; I only got 5 pieces of sorry-looking beef. The noodles came packaged separately, which is common for take-out pho, but these noodles were uncommonly stuck together, even after they soaked in the broth for 10 minutes. So, I ended up eating chunks of rice noodles. And finally, the restaurant gave lemon instead of lime for extra flavoring,  which I thought was strange and unappealing. Overall, the meal was not worth my money."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was beyond slow. Took 45 mins to get entr√©e and the place was dead. I'll get takeout if there is a next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! 25x = great meals.However I took my mom and daughter to eat got Chunky/Blonde hostess/waitress with bad attitude! Kitchen was overwhelmed on a tues nite? Daughter served WAY after us? Mom spoke up & she went into Stupid&Slow gear as punishment. Last year totties son?Michael? bartender was a Capital Prick, we used to look see if he was working then go get wings/beers elsewhere. Tottie is so nice when she's out of the kitchen ill be back- just weary......"}
{"text":"Really, really enjoyed both the pho and the Thai dishes including the crab curry.  Best combination of quality and quantity in Asian food, our family has had since moving from Toronto to Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Thank you my fellow Yelpers! The GF BF and I were craving some Vietnamese food last Friday night after the gym (yes, we are wild and crazy!) and found this new little gem based on your reviews!! You certainly steered us to a yummy spot! 

I was immediately pleased when we stepped in the door as the decor is very pretty with lots of cool, solid woods and very interesting pieces of art! We were quickly seated in the room adjacent to the bar and found a fun, joyous atmosphere surrounding us! 

We were starving so we immediately order the traditional spring rolls and some hot tea. They were fantastic! Superb peanut sauce and I am huge fan when they actually grill the pork, which Tottie's most certainly does! We wolfed these down and I seriously could have eaten 100 more! 

Next, we had the Papaya Salad with sticky rice and chicken and the Beef Pho. The sticky rice was amazing and the flavors and freshness of the papaya salad and chicken were fantastic! The beef pho was also very good, but since I just had Pho with Oxtail stock from Monsoon in Seattle, I'm a little picky right now! Still, very very good! 

At this point, we were stuffed, but I know we'll be back again this week to try a few more items! Love that they have a variety of Asian cuisines to satisfy any craving (including my fav - sizzling rice soup!)! Now if I can just get Tottie to add a delish egg crepe and pork buns...I would never leave and she would earn that last coveted star!!

P.S. Very very accommodating and understanding with food allergies, especially gluten free!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai and Viet-Chinese. Friendly, neat decor and reasonably priced. Huge portions and lots of fresh herbs. A winner."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very pleasant and the service was consistent and attentive, but I was not overly impressed with the food.  The fried chicken dumplings were the best thing we had, and admittedly, these were delicious;  light, crispy, well-cooked, tasty....really good.  But the meal went downhill from there.  

The hot-n-sour came in a bowl the size of a trough and was so very sour.  The broth was very gelatinous and the soup contained very few goodies like Chinese mushroom, pork, or even tofu.  It was mostly gooey broth. 

The dinner items we order were pretty standard fair: General Tao, Mongolian beef, and sesame chicken. The presentation was very nice and the food arrived promptly, but it had absolutely no flavor, no zing, no punch, at all.  It seemed so very underseasoned  It was so bland we didn't finish any of it.  Considering the price, we're not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a Happy Hour with people from work and we had a good time. The drinks menu was quite good and some very interesting cocktails. A couple of us had a lychee cocktail which tasted like a mojito flavored with lychee . The appetisers were also good. We had the salmon satay, chicken salad, dumplings, chicken wings and calamari. The dumplings and the chicken salad were the best. 
Service was a little slow . The decor is very interesting. 
Did not try anything from the Dinner Menu. Thats for next time."}
{"text":"Food is out of a can or frozen, not worth the time nor money, just to.many other places that are much better, they dont give you much, and be near a bathroom after you eat there!"}
{"text":"The location does not do this restaurant any justice, right next door to a plan parenthood. Food is excellent, best Asian food around."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale for a conference and Totties was just down the road from my hotel. Decided to give it a shot based on Yelp reviews.

Had pad se ew  with chicken - was just okay. I ordered it on the low side of the spice range but even still it had little flavor. They only gave me one packet of soy - I could have used 5 or 6 more to add flavor. I've never had this with bok choy in it before - I realize this is a \"fusion\" restaurant so maybe it was the point that it tasted more Chinese than Thai. In any case, was just okay."}
{"text":"Food is great, service terrible. Sloooow... We've been coming here for years now so we know what to expect.  If it wasn't for the great thai food, we'd never come here.  Patience and a nothing but time to kill are a prerequisite."}
{"text":"I love this place usually. Eat in though. I did take out tonight and got slop. Food was gray and brown and overcooked with almost no veggies. Really disappointing. My Pad Lard Na was no way even made today. I've had a great experience eating in here but take out sucks. Great service though. Taking back my leftovers tomorrow. Restaurants never know how to improve if you do not let them know. Help them and their patrons by letting establishments know when they do not meet your expectations. It's your hard earned money and you deserve to receive what you paid for (fresh good food) and not tomorrow mornings garbage."}
{"text":"If you're particular about freshness of flavor you MUST do yourself a favor &  go. The sugarcane chicken is always a must start not only fresh the yummy chicken on sugar cane you grill at the table but the plated loaded with fresh mint, cilantro, lettuce & other goodies that comes accompanies it. For less adventurous eaters their basis Pad Thai is as equally fresh but I stress to try something you never have. You will not be disappointed.
My dad is not an Asian eater but his Salmon in Basil Ginger sauce was sublime & now he'll go at the drop of a hat.
Another fabulous fact...amazing cocktails & happy hour price of $5.00 for a normally $9.00 drink ...wonderful!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great yelp find! I've been looking for a good Asian restaurant in Arizona, this is it.
Tom kha gai  soup  was spicy and tasty. I will be going back often."}
{"text":"When I typically run across an Asian fusion place, I turn around.  Based on the positive reviews here, being out of town on business and not wanting to stick with the status quo, I thought I'd give it a shot.  

I probably should have stayed on par for course, but it wasn't all bad. 

I arrived during happy hour and indulged in some Asian Tapas, which I found interesting since there was no mention of Spanish food within the Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese tilt of the restaurant.  Decor was interesting, if not a bit overdone.  But with artwork from 3 different cultures in one location, it works.  The restaurant itself appeared to be very clean, and I was greeted with smiles from every employee.

Started off w/the Shu Mai, which was in all honesty, a little salty (more on that later),  but pretty gosh darn good.  Followed those up with the vegetarian gyoza, which were....different.  The wrapping was soggy and the filling was a mish mash of overcooked and perfectly cooked veggies.  Main entree was the Thai Stir Fry with Shrimp.

First bite was excellent!  The shrimp practically melted in my mouth, and the vegetables offered excellent contrast.  Excellently seasoned, cooked to a level of crunchy perfection.  As I continued to eat however, my enthusiasm slowly started to dwindle.  The saltiness of the meal was overwhelming the level of spice that I requested, which should never, ever happen.  (5 on a scale of 7)  Nobody should eat an Asian meal and not expect a certain level of sodium, but I left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Got seated right away. Only two other tables occupied. The food was good but not outstanding. The server ignored us for several minutes and was preoccupied with other duties. It took over 30 minutes to get our check and have it be correct. She was clearly interested in other things. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and had the beef pho which was very good. The service however, was poor. They appeared busy with only two waitresses who didn't really greet me nor act to interested that I was there. Despite this l, I will give the benefit of the doubt that they were just very busy and go back because the food was yummy :)"}
{"text":"They deserve much more business - I wish it was located further north so it could be a carry out option.
Food is excellent - must try the Tottie Rolls. Great option for a group that wants Asian - but can't decide if they want Chinese, Thai , Vietnamese - they do all very well. Great bartending - excellent cocktails as well. Great atmosphere - very upscale yet comfortable setting."}
{"text":"We love Thai food and after reading the article in the January issue of Phoenix magazine elected to give Tottie's a try.

We arrived on a Friday evening to a partially full restaurant.  Found the decor and feel of the restaurant to be pleasant enough - the hostess was also very cordial, but I'm afraid this is the extent of the compliments we can pay this establishment.

Service was extremely slow - starting with a long wait of even having a server approach our table.  Everyone seem to be scurrying around - including our view of Tottie and her staff behind the front line; but the overall service was not expedited to showcase a well run operation.

Our shrimp puff appetizer arrived - and to our surprise and dismay, would guess that the pastry portion was a Pillsbury product, rolled out thin and fried.  

After another long wait our entrees finally arrived, and again, while the portions were generous, the anticipated flavor and quality of each of our dishes just wasn't there!  (Shrimp tasted fishy ... my chicken didn't seem to be fresh).

Sorry to say - we will not be back and instead will return to our other 'tried and true' Asian restaurants, where we are assured both good service and flavorful quality food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the service is wonderful,  curry chicken is very delicious I totally  recommended."}
{"text":"What a great find. Wanted something different and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try. Had an appetizer as my dinner and the presentation was amazing. There was a little fire pit to 'cook' the appetizers and it came with four amazing dipping sauces. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Asian restaurant in town. If your looking for a quick lunch tottie's is the place to be. The waitresses here are very friendly and welcome you once you enter the entrance door! Their fried rice and soup are the bomb great ambiance"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch pretty frequently and have never had a bad, or even average, experience.  The Panang curry is amazing and they include lots of vegetables, unlike most other Thai restaurants in the area.  Prices and serving sizes are reasonable.  I have no complaints on this one."}
{"text":"Tottie's is a hidden jem! The food is delicious. Good sized portions. Not overpriced. Friendly and helpful service and very fast.  Great pick you can't go wrong!  I'm becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Best Asian restaurant in the Valley! Egg Drop soup is full of veggies and chicken. Spring rolls w the peanut sauce are amazing. Thai dishes are authentic and the fried rice is excellent."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Thai places. Lil pricey but soooo gooood!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, just a tad bit salty. We got the papaya salad to start and it was delicious. The tangerine beef was ok- very salty and the cashew chicken was also pretty good. Lychee ice cream is a definite miss. Maybe try the other flavors!

Thanida, the waitress, middle aged with crazy and curly ponytail WAS VERY UNATTENTIVE AND IGNORANT. She was not helpful and we had to ask the other waitresses for help. She never came to ask how our food was and was very slow with everything else. The young male waiters were VERY NICE AND HELPFUL. 

The only thing THANIDA was fast with was the check. She kept coming back to check if we paid.

Go and eat but try to avoid THANIDA!!!! I'm warning you!"}
{"text":"Lunch today- Lemon Beef Spring Rolls and Shrimp Pad Thai, level 7- \"Thai hot.\" Well... bless her heart- our waitress asked if I had ever had level 7... I said yes, and I had. 

Wow! It's rare that I sweat in the desert. Talk about a system clearer! And, isn't that the way great Thai should be, after all? The best part about the heat? The flavor! The lemon beef spring rolls were delicious- wonderfully fresh. The shrimp was clean, large and abundant. No tiny, briny jewels of the sea for Tottie's! The portions were large enough for my guest and I to take home leftovers for two more people (yes, your assumption is correct- we didn't want to sit at table with them). 

I must confess- the aftermath? Well... reality is what reality is. Thai hot in, Thai hot out. I could actually feel the heat coming off the water. It was like hovering above a porcelain bayou. For food like this? It was more than worth it! Looking for hottie? Head in to Tottie's!"}
{"text":"This is not the best Asian restaurant in AZ (as some people have said), but this place IS definitely one of the better Asian FUSION-style restaurants around. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. The owner (Tottie herself) came around and spoke to everyone in the place.

We started with salmon satay and the small plate combo for appetizers. Everything was excellent (even the presentation with the little hibachi). My brother and I had the curry duck as entrees and we were both very happy with our selections. However, I think I enjoyed eating off my wife's plate of soft-shelled crab curry more. My mom had the salmon with basil-ginger sauce as she loved it. I'm not exactly sure what my sister had, but it was a seafood plate. She seemed to really enjoy her meal as well. Often times, it can be difficult for a large group of people to eat at the same place and for everyone to enjoy it. Tottie's was the exception.

A quick note of caution when ordering: they make VERY spicy dishes. You can ask them to not make it too spicy, so don't worry. They will provide you with more chili oil if you really need it. 

As for dessert, Tottie's is one of the few Asian restaurants that have a decent dessert selection. Everyone in my party was too full to eat any (including me), but I wanted to see try something out anyway. I ordered the fried honey banana was very happy with it. It wasn't too heavy or too light at the end of my meal (plus, it came with some of their non-dairy ice cream). They make their ice cream with coconut milk, rather than cow juice. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Service was good too.  My only compliant, and this is a strange one, is that the portions are so large that we really over bought.  We had five entree dishes between four adults and three kids.  Each entree would serve 2 to 3 people easily.   Easily over half what we ordered was leftover. I felt the waitress could have let us know.   Since we are flying out of town, and therefore no point in wrapping for another day- it meant a lot of wasted food which I dislike.  
Other than that, 5 stars.  Fast service and nice location."}
{"text":"I have 0 complaints about Totties I or Tottie's II. Other than unfortunately, not being able to afford eating there every week as I wish! Ha ha
Tottie is a friend, and a very special lady. Not only is her food delicious but, she is very friendly and welcoming with her customers, despite the fact that she is a very busy lady.

She is often in the back, personally helping with the cooking and supervising in the kitchen. I admire her. 
I have a fondness for Asian food (mainly Thai and Vietnamese). And, all the dishes I have tried here.  Including, desserts are so D- Licious!  :-)
I have a very high tolerance and passion for spicy food. Twice I asked for my Panang curry \"Thai spicy\" and they definitely delivered to my satisfaction (and to most people's spicy level of horror, I'm sure). It seared and numbed my mouth so well that I was very impressed. I rarely get anything spicy enough (to my satisfaction), even when I specifically request it.
But, if you don't appreciate spicy as I do, that's ok because they can make yours mild or medium. Just pay attention to the menu and make your specific requests (within reason, of course).
There are also, plenty of yummy options for the health conscious. Including two of my faves: Bun Tom salad (with rice noodles, lettuce, sliced grilled pork & shrimp and, sliced Vietnamese-style egg rolls,). As well as an appetizer of Vietnamese Spring rolls."}
{"text":"The food at Tottie's 2 was quite good. We tried the salmon with red curry and Thai stir fry and liked them both. It was not the best Asian food we have tried, but definitely a top 25% 

The service was very slow and not overly friendly. The food took a long time to arrive and the waitress only gave us one quick check to see if everything was fine. Overall we were not impressed with the service - the main reason this was only 3 stars. 

The decor was nice, maybe a bit overdone. It is clear that appearance is very high on the priority list at Tottie's."}
{"text":"Inconsistent.  When it's good, it's good.  When it's not, it sucks - or is disappointingly different from what you ordered the last time.  This use to be my favorite place but I've pretty much given up on it now.  Also make sure you check your take-out order before you leave.  Twice I didn't and got something other than what I had ordered.  Can't speak for the other locations but beware of this one."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, but not the best Thai food but I really cannot complain."}
{"text":"5 stars for the OUTSTANDING service
5 stars for the decor
5 stars for the SUPER deliciously tasty food: Pad Thai Salad & salmon w/ veggies
5 stars for the amazing non-dairy ice cream"}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place a bad review, but I have to keep it real. I was very disappointed with the food here. I ordered takeout and a friend picked it up so I wasn't able to scope out the ambiance. So this review is based on takeout food quality only. 

We started with the appetizer that was like a sampler (I don't remember what they called it.) My favorite thing of the whole meal was the potstickers with the sauce that came with it. These were tasty. Everything else in this app I could go without. The chicken skewers were super dry with little flavor. And the egg rolls, meh. For the main course I ordered the spicy cucumber salad with chicken. Spicy it was, but flavorful it was not. Heat that is lacking flavor is no fun. You can tell they also put way too hot chicken in the cold salad so it made the cucumbers taste very soggy and warm. It was so funky that I didn't eat it, I shared with my friend. She ordered the chicken with garlic sauce. It was okay, but nothing special. It barely had any chicken in it and was full of water chestnuts. Don't get me wrong, I love water chestnuts! But this was just over the top. 

Even though I was not impressed, I will return to try this place in person. I want to trust my fellow yelpers and hopefully they will come through for me!"}
{"text":"Totties is one of the best. I have easily eaten there 20 + times (mostly for take-out) and I have not been disappointed. Tottie Rolls are fantastic and one of the highlights of the menu with a variety of flavors and textures in on delectable package. The Thai Noodle dishes do not disappoint and the Pho is a great create your own adventure. As a general rule, the Thai and Vietnamese dishes are better than the Chinese dishes. The prices are generally very reasonable (from $9-$13), but for me the Tottie Rolls have become a mandatory $7 addition per visit making Totties a bit more expensive for me."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best restaurants in town!! Their food is absolutely delicious and the service is always great! Panang curry is the yummiest thing on the menu! Everything is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't rate places poorly unless I'm a little disappointed.  Unfortunately the food has gone farther downhill than last year.  Not sure if there has been a chef mixup or what but it hasn't improved.  May just go to the original on Thomas to enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago for a baby shower type Luncheon. Not really a true baby  shower. But, a lovely girl we know is having a baby in just a few weeks.
So one of the girls organized a Luncheon for her.
I had never been here to dine. I was very impressed. 
It is located on the West side of Scottsdale Road in a Shopping Center type place.
It is wonderfully decorated. Lots of gorgeous Art Work.
They had set up a nice long table for us,I think there was about 12 ladies.
The owner was there to greet us! She was so friendly and nice. The girls that were serving us were also ,just so nice and gave us all great service. Even though we all had separate checks which can be tough, but they handled it all perfectly. 
Tottie herself made us some wonderful appetizers.  Some egg rolls that you wrapped in some beautiful dark lettuce and cilantro.
So fresh and delicious.  Our food when it came also ,was hot and fresh.
I got the Kung Pao Shrimp. Fantastic! You can choose the heat of the meal you get. I sampled some Curry that one of the other girls got. Same thing, it was so good.

Everything that everyone got was hot ,fresh and very tasty. We even all got a salad with our lunch. A really good salad as well.Dark lettuce, carrots sliced thin. It was a lot of food for a really great price.
I am really looking forward to coming back here to dine another day.
With the owner being so involved with the place,it just really shines outstanding. She works with her employees, so they are not stressed and the service was impressive.
So check them out for lunch, you even get a choice of rice you would like. Or check them out for Dinner. It smells wonderful inside as well , with everything cooking.

Lots of parking in the lot. It is a huge parking lot. The restrooms are very clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Tottie's 2 was one of the first restaurants my wife and I fell in love with when we first moved to Arizona. We ate there pretty regularly and ordered take out from there many times. However, something really changed this last time we went. After reading some reviews here, I realized that the business was sold to someone else - and I can tell.

I know most people who read reviews care more about the quality of food, so I'll start with that. The chicken in all of the foods have always been very dry (even with old owners), so my recommendation is to not get anything with chicken. I don't know why, but everything with chicken (we've tried a lot of dishes) is always dryer than it should be. Last night, I got the pineapple fried rice. I don't know what it is, but they may have also changed to using defrosted pineapple instead of fresh ones. There is absolutely no taste in the pineapple, and they are just there to add some texture instead of also boosting the taste. Very disappointed in the change there.

The thing that gave me the motivation to write this review though, is their service. We used to love dining in because the service was quick and friendly. Last night, we were seated in a non-peak time (it was about 25% full at that point) and it took about 10 minutes for a waitress to come over and ask if we've been helped. This is fine, maybe someone just forgot about our table and we made our orders, thinking nothing of it (though we were very hungry!) After we ordered (10 minutes after we arrived), another table of three was seated a couple of booths away from us. This table ordered about 5 minutes later, and yet they got their food a full 10 minutes before we did. By this point, I thought maybe they left out our orders since it's been close to 20 minutes before we got our food. But we did finally get it after a long time. Keep in mind that the restaurant at this point still wasn't very busy, though somehow our order was made after a couple of new tables that came (perhaps they switched up the order?).

After we finished eating and needed a couple of boxes and the check, the waitress took our food away and set it in their dirty dishes area and then went to pour wine, bring food out for other tables, put dirty dishes away, bring more food out, carry more dishes away, until I finally asked about our food. She brought the check, and also the boxed foods, but the entire process took another ten minutes.

The main concern here is that the restaurant wasn't busy. It was at best half-filled, and there were multiple waitresses. The efficiency with which they did things was horrendous, and it's really sad that what used to be our favorite Asian-fusion spot now turned into a horrendous memory. I really hope they change their ways and learn that they can provide a better customer experience by just being more aware."}
{"text":"This is the place to eat Thai food in Scottsdale!!
The food is delicious, super flavorful and plenty!!
Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tottie's Asian Fusion is simply AWESOME!  I have been getting the Papaya Salad with Steamed Vegetables and the Lemon Grass Chicken.  The colors of this dish are like a rainbow!  When they bring the tray that it comes on... the presentation is WOW!  This is the only restaurant that I have been to where the food presentation is so beauty I have taken pictures... FOR REAL!!!  And the Taste of the food is over the top as well!  Tottie is an Awesome lady and all the employees are friendly too. It's just the BEST place.  If you have not been to Tottie's on Scottsdale Road...You must try!  Fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars 

Oh Tottie's. I think I love you because our names are similar... Beyond that, you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service! 

The first time I went to Tottie's it was for my Favorite Bear's birthday party. I arrived before Happy Hour ended and scored a Sake Bomber (or two?) before we were seated for dinner. I let the birthday boy handle all of the ordering. He knows what I like! I don't remember exactly what all we had but I do know that I want an IV drip of her curry sauce in my arm at all times. I also enjoyed her pork belly lettuce cups. Yep, PORK BELLY. It was so good! 

The second visit I had, I ordered a duck with creamy curry noodle dish. It was not on the menu, and you're lucky if you can get it, but if you do, I wouldn't mind if you named your next child after me. You're welcome. The duck was tender and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the most delicious creamy, spicy curry sauce. I could eat it every day. Seriously. During our meal, our server was friendly but a little absentminded. She also seemed like she was new because she wasn't terribly knowledgeable on the menu. At the end of my meal, Tottie asked me about my food and thanked me for coming in. 

I am looking forward to my next visit to Tottie's The food is great, the servings are huge, the prices are reasonable. I know 5 stars from me is in their future!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there last night for dinner. They closed at 10 during the weeknights which is great because so many restaurants close at 9. It was kind of hidden in the plaza (Its next to Trader Joes). My friend and I shared the sesame chicken and beef chow mein. The food came out pretty quick and it was pretty big portions! All main dishes come with heaping bowl of rice which is awesome! Our server was wonderful and very pleasant!"}
{"text":"the Thai med. spicy seafood plate was perfect. Portions were large enough for 2. The spice was piquant and I could still taste the food. Lots of seafood and the bell peppers were delicious. We had a great time, The drinks were really good and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"i order takeout from Totties at least once every other week.  large portions, fresh, quality vegetables & lean cuts of protein are a staple of Totties.  Best egg drop soup I've tasted & at a fabulous price.  I recommend ordering the soup for 4 & eating leftovers for lunch....it's quite tasty even reheated!"}
{"text":"Appetizers and service were great.  We got the sampler platter, pork and shrimp spring rolls and some edamame.  They all came out great and very tasty.

However, the main course fell short.  I ordered the red curry with duck.  Some of the duck was cold. 

My wife ordered a tofu veggie thing \"Thai Hot\" it came back at medium (at best)...it also had a small piece of meat in with it.  They remade the order and came back hot (for me), but she said still not hot enough.  

Our friend ordered a basil shrimp dish that seems to have came out the best."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour a few weeks ago.  I was exhausted and just wanted a place to chillax after a long day of school.  I like that they have menus outside, so that you can decide if you want to come in before \"committing\".  I was still in my medical scrubs, so I appreciated how there was \"no funny business\" about having to be shi-shi in such a gorgeous restaurant.  I truly enjoyed the decor.
 
I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Tottie who was so personable.  We chatted for a while.  The bartender was pleasant, accommodating and not bad on the eyes either :P  I ordered the Orient Express for only $5.  It was so good!  I love that the drink menu is categorized from dry to sweet.

For my meal, I ordered the Chiang Mai noodles without chicken.  It was good, but soupier than I expected.  It got thicker as it cooled down.  It had a nice flavor, but then again I love curry.  I did not expect it to be so much food!  I had leftovers for days!  Good food, gorgeous environment.  I definitely had a better experience here then at the location in South Scottsdale.  I could really see myself coming here for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"This review is long over due as Tottie's is my local Thai go-to. It's a love hate relationship. Their spring rolls are good but the entrees are so big that I usually go entree only. The Panang with shrimp is the best item on their menu IMO. Full of flavor and vegetables. The green curry is good too, but the Panang is superior. 
My favorite Thai dish is usually Pad Thai with shrimp. For whatever reason the Pad Thai here is about a 2.5. It's covered in way too much sauce, bland, and the noodles are underwhelming. If you know good Pad Thai, this is the polar opposite. I haven't been to Thailand yet but some of the Pad Thai in Hiroshima made me realize what the dish should taste like. 
Happy hour Kirin and Kirin light are $2.50...outstanding value. 
You will leave full and if you stick to a curry you should expect to enjoy Totties."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Their thai food is just rediculously good. Pad Thai and Green Curry were excellent. Service was a bit slow, but we had a large party and it was a Friday night..."}
{"text":"Best pad thai we've ever had! I would definitely recommend to any of my friends."}
{"text":"If Totties couldn't have gotten better- they added a sushi bar!!!
Not only that but I asked what they recommended and they made something special with my favorites incorporated! Tottie is the sweetest!

Great service, amazing food, great ambiance, it's a must to come here!"}
{"text":"We come here and love it every time. Spring rolls are great, get extra peanut sauce! 
Kids love the fried rice, steamed pot stickers, the rolls are always fresh, Tottie rolls are yummy, great happy hour! Great service dining in or take out too."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at Tottie's.  Probably one of the better appointed Thai restaurants you'll ever eat at.  The Pad Se Ew is always tasty.  WATCH OUT for their spice levels.  Even when you specify medium spicy, the kitchen staff gets heavy handed.  Err on the lower side of the spicy scale if you don't want your lips to catch fire.  The Tottie rolls were creative...egg rolls served with fresh lettuce, mint, and cilantro so you could pick the herbs and roll them up into the lettuce.  Loved that.  This was our 2nd time here and it's always a good choice."}
{"text":"Always amazing food! Panang curry is a must have! The people here are very sweet too! :)"}
{"text":"You must try the Tangerine Shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about the to-go dinner that I ordered for my bf and I from Tottie's 2 last night. Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm. Scrumptiousness!

But back to the Tangerine Shrimp, it's sweet, it's a little sour, it's drenched in a blackish glaze (so don't freak out if it looks like black globs of shrimp, like I did), it's surrounded by orange slices, it's fried in tempura.... and it's amazing. Judging by looks alone, this dish does not look appetizing. But what it lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for in taste. You will be missing out if you don't try it.

Now on to the rest of the Tottie's extravaganza, we ordered:

- Kung Pao Shrimp - Fresh and crisp vegetables chopped into little cubes, tons of whole peanuts and succulent meaty shrimp in a spicy soy flavored sauce. Peanuts and shrimp in every bite!

- Scallops with Black Bean Sauce - Fresh veggies and HUUUUGE meaty scallops in the most amazingly flavorful yet light black bean sauce I've ever tasted. OMG good.

- Pad Thai with Chicken - Thai stir fried noodles (not overcooked and not undercooked, instead they were moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection!) yummy fried egg pieces, crisp bean sprouts, shredded carrots, flavorful chicken (it was moist! not dry at all!), and topped with millions of crushed peanuts. Pad Thai heaven.

- Fried Won Tons - For only about $6 you get 10 of these little drops from heaven. Won tons encasing pork and formed into little ball-like shapes - I'm astounded that I liked these as much as I did, as I'm not a huge pork fan. But the meat inside was so moist! And flavorful! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as a spicy mustard sauce, another true taste bud delight.

Now, a couple of notes before you head on over to Tottie's 2:

- Portions are pretty large. We had leftovers, but I must admit that I stuffed myself silly with food.
- For the high quality of the food, the price point at Tottie's is excellent. Yeah, it's on the pricier side of Asian Fusion food, but it didn't feel like Tottie hijacked my wallet. Entree's are around $10-12 each depending on if you pick shrimp, chicken or beef (shrimp will always be the most expensive - but SO worth it, as this is high quality seafood).
- Take out is an excellent option if you don't feel like eating at the restaurant. It's fast and easy.
- Their online menu has sushi items on it, but if you go to the N. Scottsdale Rd location they don't serve sushi. Originally I had tried to order some but on the phone I was informed that sushi isn't on their menu - so if this is what you desire, go to the spot on East Thomas Road.

Hands down, the best Asian food I've tried in the valley. I'm officially a Tottie's 2 addict. I was so immensely satisfied with this meal, and now I'm dreaming about the leftovers I have for lunch..."}
{"text":"Great little Asian restaurant with comfortable seating, great low key lighting (no bright lights that hurt the eyes), and great food! The happy hour menu is nice for sharing. The soups, spring rolls, curry dishes,  and the coconut ice cream are all really delicious."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to write this, but ... that was the worst meal I've had in years. A real Asian chef would never put it on anyone's table. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce. With overcooked shrimp. Overcooked, unchewable veggies. And a sauce so sweet and syrupy it could rot your teeth before you made it out the door. Even the rice was overcooked, and don't get me started on the bland, bland, bland egg roll and salad. My friend said much the same of her \"crispy\" noodles with basil, said noodles totally drowning in (again inappropriate) sweet sauce. Both dishes looked so ugly on the plate (like heaps of pre-chewed food) that after fishing out the shrimp, I just covered my plate with my napkin and ignored it. I promised my friend some real crispy noodles at Green Tea Bistro next time we go out and that's the end of my story. Wish I hadn't had to write it that way."}
{"text":"What a great experience - the food was delicious from the appetizers to the main course, and the plates were overflowing.  My wife and I were actually able to get two more dinners from the leftovers.  
The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly, and very willing to make changes to the menu.  Lastly, the seating is very comfortable and isolated so you're not sitting right on top of the next table.
We will definitely be going back for more of those delicious Gyoza and some Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I love the flavors of the panang curry. The atmosphere is beautiful enough to impress a first date. I love this place, the staff and of course the food!"}
{"text":"The service is poor, to the point that it affects the meal. The food is an interesting mix of various Asian cuisines, and it isn't bad. But overall, it's a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE everything about this place!!!

The drink menu is amazing. 
The appetizers divine.
But the soft shell crab in curry sauce is really sublime.

I can't rave enough about the food, the service, the atmosphere...and if you are a fan of soft shell crab, then you MUST visit now.

Note: EVERYTHING on the menu is out of this world delicious. I just happen to be addicted to the soft shell crab dish."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best Asian restaurants I've ever been to. Who would have thought you could find that in Arizona?!?

The interior is very open, with a classy feel and high ceilings. The staff was all extremely welcoming throughout the entire dining experience. 

We started with a few appetizers, my favorite being the Spicy Cucumber salad, which was so delicious. I'd never tried anything like it before. We split a few entrees, some common staples (Pad Se Ew and a shrimp curry), but the entree that unexpectedly stood out was the Hot and Spicy Eggplant. I've never ever had eggplant prepared like that - the strips were cooked so they almost melted in your mouth (not chewy like I anticipated), and were soaked in a dark brown sweet and spicy sauce. Amazing!

We were far too stuffed to try dessert, but I can only imagine how good that would have been. A five star spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Super yummy. Tried a sampler app and two other apps, everything we'd be super happy to eat again
 Also received great service! Gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Nicest, most upbeat, most positive, and silly waitress ever at a Thai restaurant. It definitely helped make our meal even better with the amazing service. The food was also super tasty. I can never go wrong with the veggie sides, but my kung pao shrimp was delicious, and my mom's shrimp w/ black bean sauce was even better. My dad, when initially served, found that part of his salmon was cold, so he had to send it back. But they promptly fixed the issue, and then he found it to be really good. I also enjoyed looking at all of the decorations, they seemed to make the restaurant cozy and have a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Ambience was nice and their chowmein and orange chicken was good. Portions could be a little bigger otherwise a decent place to visit."}
{"text":"Guys. Don't get the Vietnamese here. It's pretty bad. We tried the bun Tom and the chicken pho. Flavorless and inauthentic. Also was craving delicious crab puffs. These are the worst I've ever had. Sad. On a good note my kids loved the chicken pad kra pow."}
{"text":"Sad.  So sad.

We've been looking for GOOD Chinese since moving to Scottsdale three years ago. So, after checking with Yelp and reading such glowing reviews, I recommended Totties, and noticing they have a new location nearer to home, we went to Totties 2.

Now I'm wondering if I was in the same restaurant as my fellow Yelpers who gave it 5 Stars. 

Atmosphere was upscale and pretty. We were seated, and asked if we wanted something to drink. They have beer and wine on the menu, but we'd walked through a full bar/lounge area on the way to our table. We asked what kind of Vodkas were available. Our server was befuddled and left to retrieve the bartender who could better advise and take our order. This should have been a sign of what to expect. The bartender arrived in short order, and informed us the upper end of their inventory would be Absolute. Not thrilled, we persevered and ordered one on the rocks. No inquiry re garnish, Drink arrived sans garnish and when we asked for olives, they had none. Bartender apologized and said this was only his fourth day. 

We thought - \"OK, this is Totties 2 - we've caught them in the throes of a new operation and they're just working the bugs out. We'll cut them some slack\" - becoming empathetic to their plight.

On to the meal. We ordered Hot and Sour Soup and Totties Pork Spring Rolls. Spring rolls arrived, four presented on a very large platter, more than half of which was very strangely covered with green leaf and mache lettuce. Spring rolls were just OK, and my thought was these were from Sysco rather than the implied home made by Tottie. 

The Hot and Sour Soup was an enormous portion - obviously meant for two. It was mediocre at best, and had a consistency and texture that again lead me to think this was not freshly prepared but more out of a plastic bag provided by some food service company. 

For us, Kung Pao is generally a good gauge of preparation. This version didn't have the traditional peanuts, BUT it did have zucchini. Very odd. 

Finally, I tried the Egg Foo Yung, and asked for it to be prepared with pork. Large portion, but nothing special. Drowning in brown sauce. (One thing that struck us as strange, all the food was the same brown color.) 

Toward the end of the meal, we received a visit from a woman who turned out to be Tottie herself. We introduced ourselves, and inquired how long the new location had been open. She replied \"Six months\" when we more expected her to say 'six days'. We were more than a little aghast. 

For us, Totties 2 was just a sad thing all around. 

Our quest for decent Chinese continues."}
{"text":"Picked up a to-go order tonight.  Soft Crab Springrolls and Pad Thai.  Food was alright.. nothing too spectacular.  But I'm giving it 4 whole stars for the service!  The short few minutes that I was in there, the young girl was just adorable.  Very sweet, chatty and complimentary.  Wish we had service like that in California!  After a long day of traveling it was very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Very good food but, very poor service with many open tables.  Waited ten minutes to have a waitress ask us about drink order then the drinks never came.  After food was served we were not checked on again.  Will only utilize take-out going forward."}
{"text":"I got the Tai Pho and it was very good and came in good proportion. Not the best pho I have ever had but, it does pass for a good dinner meal. The restaurant is very nice outside and inside. Our waitress was very lovely. There was much to complain."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to the lair of lusciousness known as Totties by my good buddy (and fellow Yelper) Alexander C.  Alex had been to Totties Asian Fusion II very recently and was so impressed (believe me, this guy is discerning, so for him to give something a thumb's up -- you'd best believe it) that he organized an outing/evening for like 10 big ol' bears of men for a sake bomber happy hour & dinner.   See Alexander's review for exact details and descriptions of what we ordered and ate, but I'm going to make this review short & sweet.

Tottie's rocks. The service was impeccable.  Tottie herself came to our table and made special recommendations on food.  I've never felt so attended to by a restaurateur before.  This lady knows her stuff in the front of the house, but even more so, she can cook her petite Asian ass off.  EVERYTHING we had was amazing and her Thom Kha Kai soup blew my socks off.  I crave....for days...

The parking lot's a little wonky now during construction, but it's a small price to pay for this level of amazing food.  We were 10 hungry heffers when we arrived (not one of us under 200 pounds, so you know we like to eat) and no one walked outta the place hungry or needing ANYTHING.  Service & food to the max.  

I applaud Tottie for opening a second killer location and I thank Alex for introducing us to this amazing pocket of awesomeness deliciousness!"}
{"text":"We like to go in for lunch. It is so good! Love the Tangerine Beef and Vegetable Fried Rice which we split and it's still too much food. Food is tasty, fresh and hot. Atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. Service is wonderful. This restaurant is super clean."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese and Thai food around. Spring rolls are not dry but moist. Combo appetizer comes surja small fire pit to reheat appetizers. Nice plate presentation and excellent price for all the quality food you get. 100% recommend it!"}
{"text":"Not a great version of Singapore Rice Noodles. The dish was overwhelmed with curry and not the normal yellow curry that most places use, but a green variety. The beef that they put in the dish (instead of pork) was practically inedible and they must use the lousy beef for these kinds of dishes. I can't picture a real beef dish with this slop involved. The noodles were also wet and very bad once you started digging through and they were cut oddly as well. The rice was a failure as well, more mushy junk that did not get tasted before heading out of the kitchen. Egg rolls are four to an order and they say crispy on the menu, but will arrive mushy and looking crispy, but no crunch at all. Also, this place has different prices on the website compared to the menu. 8 bucks for those eggrolls now. Extra star because staff made me laugh when I picked up food, but bad meal to start the year."}
{"text":"First off, these people rip you off. I ordered their lunch special based off their online menus, which stated it was $6.50. When I picked up my order, they tried to charge me $8.95. The manager/owner (not sure who she was) started arguing with me saying those menus online were old and prices went up. I refused to pay over $6.50 so she said fine and walked away. The food itself was just mediocre. Definitely wont be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is quick! Portions are healthy and always have leftovers :) Great lunch spot, fun for dinner too!"}
{"text":"We used to get lunch from here for work occasionally. I only ate in the restaurant once or twice. I have a tendency to dislike Asian Fusion as a rule BUT I have nothing bad to say about Tottie's. 
Everything I have had here was amazing, but the Tottie Rolls and the fried rice really stand out. Just thinking about them now makes me very hungry. The best compliment I can give is that I still yet have not had the chance to try everything I want to because I'm stuck on these items. 
Would recommend in all situations."}
{"text":"There are two locations --- the first (Tottie's 1) on Thomas/Hayden next to CVS in the Fresh and Easy plaza, and the second (Tottie's 2) is on Scottsdale/Hayden next to Trader Joe's and behind Fuego de Chao.
I've been a regular at Totties for almost a year now. I've been to both locations but live closer to the Scottsdale Rd location so that's my usual spot. Tottie is there everyday to make sure her business runs smoothly, and she is not just hiding in a back office.  At any point in the evening you can find her behind the bar, managing take-out, or helping the kitchen if they need it.  She is a real treat!! Her professionalism is obvious, and is complimented by her spunk and pizzazz.  Tottie is always thinking of ways to improve her offerings and menu. The Scottsdale Rd. location just added a sushi bar, and matches the quality of the sushi at Totties 1. 
The happy hour prices are a great deal. I always order Peace On Earth, a vodka martini that does just the trick to help me wind down. You can also get great deals on food and apps, and happy hour runs 4-7pm everyday (even weekends!). 
I love Tottie's for two main reasons -- the atmosphere and the healthy options. There are plenty of go-to Chinese, Thai, or Vietnamese food options on the menu if you're having a craving, but I usually stick with the spring rolls as my main meal. Basically its salad wrapped around beef, shrimp, pork, or chicken, and then held together with rice paper. They are so good and filling its like being able to eat a salad with your hands! Many of the entrees are large enough so that I'm still full even though I'll usually skip rice. 

I could go on and on about my experiences here, but it really is five stars. I love the food, atmosphere, and owner. I've noticed many patrons are repeat customers as well."}
{"text":"By far the worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life. As an orange chicken enthusiast, I can confidently say orange chicken does not get any worse than this. Completely dry. You can't even tell you're eating chicken. Just dry clusters of batter. Don't get me wrong, I love my orange chicken extra crispy. This wasn't crispy. Dry and hard. Pas Thai was okay. Not as good as you can get at pretty much any Thai place, but it wasn't off putting like the orange chicken. The only thing that wasn't horrible was the fact that they had pretty big portions. If you want large portions of bad food, come to Totties."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food here is really good overall. I have been here a few times for their lunch specials and the portions are HUGE. So far I've had their Chicken Chow Mein and Chicken with Broccoli and both were fantastic. It can be hard to find good Asian food in Scottsdale but this definitely has to be one of the better choices. It's also nice to be able to pick different Asian cuisines as well, especially if you were to go with a group of people. The fried rice that it comes with is tasty and the salad for takeout is great as well. Just keep in mind that the wait for take-out can be a while so I would just call ahead and give yourself enough time."}
{"text":"Tottie's deserves an update due to my hastily written, hangry induced review below. For those of you that don't know, which is a shame, hangry is when you're so hungry you're angry. We've all seen those Snickers commercials ...

Tottie's is one of my go-to places and I can't leave 3 stars hanging around if I want to show my face in there again ... no one can keep me from my delicious Tottie Rolls. Not even myself!"}
{"text":"We love Totties.  Our office orders from here at least once a week.  The Panang Curry is to die for as well as the Pad Se Ew which is a variation of Chow Fun Noodles with veggies and your choice of meat.  I brought a couple who traveled through Thailand for 4 months and they said this was the closest to the authentic type of Thai food they experienced abroad!  It really doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"I must give credit to the management for seating us when we didn't have a reservation Christmas Day.  I called at 11:34 AM today and was told I did not need a reservation unless I had 6 or more people in my party.   When I got to the restaurant the girls at the front told me they couldn't seat me as I did not have a reservation.  I asked for the manager since what I was told on the phone vs what I was being told at the moment didn't align .  He gave us a little resistance at first but ended up offering us a table.  Thank you!  The tottie rolls were great.  The main meal - chicken and veggies was ok.  the tofu green curry that was out of this world.  I'd come back if I was really hankering for Asian fusion."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good place, but it doesn't compare to my favorite thai spot.  We ordered a lot of dishes so we could all share.  The pad Thai was a little too red and sweet, it was as if it had sweet and sour sauce.  The cashew chicken was ok, not my favorite.  We also had a beef dish and a shrimp dish plus the combo appetizer platter and edamame.  Yes we ordered way too much for 4 people.  The cocktails were super weak, overall, it is ok."}
{"text":"Tottie's has the best curry, Thai, pho, you name it. So delicious. I Love to come here for happy hour or for for take out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It doesn't look like much from the outside but when you walk in the decor is perfect. The host was prompt and courteous. The waitress was helpful, friendly and attentive. The sushi chef put on a show for my 4 year old that kept him thoroughly entertained. Then there was the food. One my kid ate it which lets you know it must be good. The sushi was very fresh and the panang had just the right amount of spice. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"An offbeat bistro just north of Downtown Scottsdale that knows the key to good Asian fusion: mix the menu, not the dishes.

Tottie's offers large portions of hearty, and authentic, Asian cuisine that ranges from Chinese to Vietnamese to Thai to the owner's native Laotion.

We began the meal with an order of Vietnamese summer rolls, packed with shrimp, greens, mint, and a roasted pork that brought to mind char siu. The peanut dipping sauce added a pleasant touch. This was followed by a silky Panang curry, an on-point pad thai, and a ginger-basil salmon. There were no weak links, even if the Panang curry was a little muted and the pad thai noodles on the thinner side.

For the size of the dishes and quality of preparation, the meal was a good choice for a late lunch."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars - really great place!  The decor is nice with cool artwork and beautiful flowers on every table, the service is friendly and food is authentic and delicious!  Their happy hour specials are pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Yup. That good. It's all kind of a blur, but I remember being pretty exhausted, and totally famished. Someone in the group got on the phone and called ahead to Tottie's to make sure food was waiting for us when we arrived.

We arrived, and there's already soup on the table and a couple orders of spring rolls. I try to express how thankful I am for their accommodating us, and to my astonishment there's already a spring roll in my mouth. When I try again I can't get the words past my soup spoon.

Not 5 minutes after sitting down the main dishes arrive, each one piping hot, some spicy hot. What did we order? I wish I knew. There were noodles. There were vegetables. Each dish had a very unique flavor that kept me shoveling it in and regretting I wasn't taking more time to taste it. Once I started to fill I savored the flavors a little more and was able to confirm that yes, this really is good food.

The food coupled with the splashy, colorful, retina workout of an ambiance made my trip to Tottie's memorable, and yet at the same time, as I sit here weeks later, it sort of seems like a dream. A tasty, nourishing, delightful dream."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the best Asian lunches I've had in quite some time.   I had the chicken and vegetables.   The chicken was tender and plentiful and the vegetables were crisp.  Plenty to take home and roll up in a burro the next morning."}
{"text":"Good food/ excellent service / patio dining. The Pho is exceptionally good and priced 8.95 is a great value - spring rolls were fresh and tasty . Highly recommend this Resturant and they also gave a sushi bar ..."}
{"text":"This is a conditional two-star review that might get upgraded later if conditions warrant, as I'm told by our Scottsdale hosts who have eaten here numerous times that this is not the ordinary state of affairs. But after expressly warning our waitress about one of our party's extreme cilantro allergy -- she will go into anaphylaxis -- the kitchen turned out an appetizer with just that on it. Inattentive, slow service, and the bill came back wrong, too. In their favor, the manager gave us coupons off for a future visit, which helped smooth things over, and the food was quite tasty when it finally arrived. Worth trying again on a better night."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Totties 2 last night.  When we got home the rice containers were not even close to being full (3/4 full each), and the food was badly spiced.  We asked for medium, but all three dishes were hot.  The pad thai was almost inedible because there were so many peppers in it.  Aside form being spicy, the food left little to the imagination and was disappointing.  The vegetables were overcooked and bordered on being soggy and the chicken was overcooked and tough. Given the comments from diners before us, we may have just caught them on a bad night or ordered the wrong dishes, but we wasted $45 on our meals."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from Totties #2. Quick pickup time. We ordered the Tottie's small plate combo (appetizers) so delicious. The spring rolls were perfectly crisp and tasted even better with the sweet and sour sauce. The tempura shrimp was crispy, non greasy and had a large thick piece of shrimp underneath the perfect tempura batter. I wasn't overly impressed by the chicken satay or gyoza. But still yummy! A huge app combo, 2 of each;)

The pork Thai fried rice was spectacular. Rice was perfectly cooked, crisp bean sprouts, thin tender pieces of pork and lots of fresh basil!

The shrimp chow mein was great! Large pieces of garlic shrimp, thin noodles in perfect brown sauce and plenty of crisp veggies, broccoli snow peas onions and carrots. 

Over all great delish food and we will absolutely be back here!"}
{"text":"Totties is a great place to grab Chinese- especially on a budget! The prices are not cheap, but you get about three times the average restaurant portion size in one entree. Seriously. 

My boyfriend and I ventured to Totties for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The place is overly decorated with Asian/Indian-esque decor (elephants, bamboo plants, etc). It gives off a nice vibe in somewhat of a cheesy way. Anyhow, when we were there, the restaurant was completely silent, aside from the cooking chefs in the back and the couple seated next to us. Not a big deal. 

We happened to come in during happy hour and decided that we would try some happy hour entrees (not aware of the large portion sizes to come). We ordered the fried calamari and the veggie gyoza. Both came out in about 10 minutes within ordering. The fried calamari was delicious. It wasn't too rubbery or chewy, and came with a warm curry sauce that wasn't hot enough to destroy the taste of the calamari. The veggie gyoza was alright. It came with 5 pieces, and they were practically falling apart in the dish full of some soy sauce- like dip. They were a little lacking in flavor, but not too bad to complain about.

Our food came out shortly after. My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken on a spicy level of 4, and I got the chow fun on a spicy level of 5, which actually came out as chow mien (pretty much the same dish but with different noodles). My boyfriends chicken was really good! The chicken wasn't overly breaded, and had the perfect amount of sauce on it- not to mention the GIGANTIC portion. It also came with what I'd image a 16 oz bowl of fried rice. My chow mien was really good, and I enjoyed that the noodles weren't overly greasy or drenched in sauce. 

Now, I'm sure you're wondering how this review warrants three stars. Well, I'll tell you. After being filled with the happy hour apps we'd eaten, I couldn't finish much of my 3lbs of chow meien. That being said, of course I asked for it to be boxed. The buss boy, or whoever it was, took my dish into the back and brought out the traditional style small Chinese food take out boxes with my food in it. Uhm, excuse me, but if I order and pay for all the chow mien that you bring me, I expect to get it by the time I leave. I felt somewhat robbed, as I know I could have used my leftovers for a solid two meal servings. It was a four, but this little mishap knocked it down to a three. Whatever. 

Anyhow. To sum it up, will we be back? Of course. I just have to make sure that I'm on an empty stomach and don't order appetizers so that I can finish enough food so that ALL my leftovers can be given to me.

Food- 8.5/10

The attentive bartender was super friendly and accommodating.. I watched all the servers at work and looked over the menu and saw that the employees are very kind, welcoming and knowledgeable I look forward to dinning here soon~"}
{"text":"More fusion as expected in this part of town...

Overall Rating:  3.7 rounded up to a 4.0
Service:  Pleasant and gracious  - 4.45
Food:      Experiences have been mixed.  Generally a 3.0 - 3.7
Ambience:  4.0-4.5

With the same menu and a little bit morel formal feel, the experience at this location is pretty similar to the original/first one in South Scottsdale.  Not necessarily a destination drive but it's as Southeast Asian as you're gonna get in this area."}
{"text":"Thai, Vietnamese a nice patio, good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all.

Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value. 

The happy hour menu has Asian tappas (apps) for $5 and many $5 cocktails and glasses of wine. WE had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad, good but nothing special. The veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish.

My cocktail was great but it was a bit strong.

For our mains we had the Salmon with green curry, It came in a HUGE Bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish. $12.95

We also had the dragon noodles, which was veggies tofu and glass noodles. It was light and fresh. ~10

Over all great quality value and patio I will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy! The happy hour munchies are awesome. I've had several meals here as well that were all amazing. I just wish I lived closer! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is so-so, service is awkward, bartender is great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Thai, Chinese, etc., this is NOT the place for it, hence the word \"fusion\" in the name of the restaurant. That being said, what cuisines they do fuse together come out impeccably tasty. I've had better experience at this location than at the location on Thomas. Friendly staff most of the time. Clean and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Consistently great, not good, every time. This is my spot when i have a craving for Thai food and I am in Scottsdale. Get the peanut chicken skewers and enjoy. The location is great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of eating in.Beautifully decorated with a great staff.Wonderful experience overall!!!"}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker, there are 2 things I'm always looking for, good pizza and good chinese food. My favorite chinese dish has always been shrimp with lobster sauce. The New York in me loves a white egg sauce as opposed  to a black bean sauce. Until today, I had not found any that lived up to my standards and my memories. My life in Arizona is now complete. Their lobster sauce was excellent, excellent, excellent!  My companion had a Tai food dish and was moaning in pleasure while eating. To complete the experience, since we were celebrating my birthday, our server brought us a dessert of coated, fried bananas, with a scrumptious sauce and coconut ice cream. This was the best birthday ever! Did I mention that our server was fantastic in every way?"}
{"text":"Best Curry ever:) Nice little outdoor patio- so cute you forget it faces the parking lot! 
Love the fresh ingredients and imaginative flavors. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great hidden spot!  Very diverse & extensive menu, something for everyone!  A mix of Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese & Japanese.  Full bar with great signature cocktails."}
{"text":"Love this place. My first time here. I ordered the Lemon Grass Beef Spring Rolls. Amazing!  So fresh. So flavorful. And, a very large serving (4). I'll be back. Such a charming and friendly environment. My server, Pu encouraged me to come back for Happy Hour--everyday from 4-7pm.   I will!!!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the Grilled Salmon with steamed vegetables.  The service was superb, the food was delicious.  One of our \"Favorite\" Asian Fusion Restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"This is possibly one the best Thai places I have ever been to. It's in strip mall and nice-casual inside. But the food is great. The waitress told us their chef is generous on the spices so we might want to be careful in order our food \"spicy\" - we took a chance and went for the spicy number 7 (the hottest). Wow, she was right. My mouth was on fire but was so good. The right mix of sweet and tangy. Will definitely check this place out again."}
{"text":"This review is definitely overdue.  On a particularly cold day, a few months ago, I had the craving for a decent wonton soup WITH shrimp. I decided to give this place a try since it had such great reviews and by the look of the prices, I was hoping they would have the flavor I was craving.  Boy did they ever and more even than I could even fit in my stomach! The prices are reasonable for being in Scottsdale/Paradise Valley and the portions are very large.  The wonton soup left me so impressed I started ordering takeout once a week from this place.  So far I have tried the tangerine chicken, the sesame chicken, the mongolian beef and the wonton soup.  All have been delicious and all have left me looking forward to eating the left overs the next day.  You cannot go wrong with this place.  Even though I have a PF Changs on my way home from work, I will be stopping here to get takeout if that is what is needed for dinner.  I can't wait to try everything that they have to offer! Their menu is so diverse! Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese and even sushi.  Totti's has it all."}
{"text":"Tottie's Asian Fusion is the cleanest Asian food I've ever had. It was so good and I feel really good after eating it, too!"}
{"text":"I'm not really an Asian food enthusiast, but I have to say I loved Tottie's!  Since the menu is pretty extensive, we asked for a recommendation and had the green curry.  My dining companion likes things a little spicier than I do, so we ordered a medium-low.  It wasn't too much heat for me, but I can only imagine what ordering hot will do to you!  The curry was fantastic.  The heat cannot mask the flavor of this dish!  

I'm already looking forward to going back to Tottie's the next time my husband puts his foot down about eating at yet another Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great decor, good food, generous portions, and good service. Loved the pick 4 appetizers and papaya salad platter - wasn't too sweet and was served with chicken and sticky rice. We tasted the chicken larb and didn't touch it again. If we lived here we would come back again (and we would have told them their larb was off)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last few months and am more than pleased with the dishes I've tried.  On the first visit, I discovered vegetarian pho ... So yum!  HUGE bowl of veggie broth with noodles and chinese vegetables (hold the egg).  I darn near ate the whole cauldron!! hah 
This last visit, I ordered the Panang, vegetarian.  Again, a great big vat of curry with coconut milk and veggies presented to me.  I asked for a little heat, and the waitress suggested a medium-low spice level, which turned out perfect.  Enough to get my taste buds awakened and keep me coming back for more mouthfuls!  My only *complaint* is that I asked for brown rice instead of white, and got hit with a $2 charge on the check.  I feel like if you're going to up-charge, you should at least inform the customer at the time of the request. 
My dinner mate ordered a salmon dish that came with steamed veggies.  The salmon had a dark sauce on it, sprinkled with sesame ... The sauce was tasty, but the fish was a bit overdone and dry. 
All in all, I'm sure I will be back.  Its conveniently located, clean, prompt service and food delivery, and I've not had to wait for a table. The prices on the menu can feel high, but you are getting a really fair amount of food for your buck."}
{"text":"Tottie your food is pretty darn hottie! Where do I begin with the feast. We ate family style, so we started with spring rolls, soup and cucumber salad. Each item was tasty but not filling enough so that I didn't want to move on to the next course -- just enough to wet the appetite for more. So on to the next course. For the entree, we had Singapore rice noodles with curry, Chicken and noodles (I think it was called Chicken Chow Fun), the hot and spicy eggplant and a tofu salad plus white and brown rice. Each dish complimented each other and provided a perfect blend of tastes. I enjoyed every bite and couldn't stop eating. It was just too delicious. Of everything, my favorites were the chicken noodle dish, the shrimp curry and the eggplant. I loved the arrangement of spices. Each bite hit a different part of my taste buds. 

The decor of Tottie's is filled with authentic character true to the cuisine. If I didn't know better, if I closed my eyes I could just as easily  be in a SF restaurant. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. It has the true feel of a neighborhood restaurant and I got the sense that those who visit a lot are probably known by name. But for those newbies like myself, they still made me feel at home and as if I'd been coming there for years!

To end the amazing meal, we tried the Fried Honey Banana. It was a perfectly sized dessert to share with four and incredibly sweet so you could have a taste and be completely satisfied. And what's an Asian Fusion meal without a fortune cookie! So I opened my fortune cookie expecting some random sentence that didn't really make much since. But instead, my fortune read: \"You will be recognized and honored as a community leader.\" Ok Tottie. I'll take that! Finally a fortune that makes some sense. :)

So until next time Tottie's Asian Fusion...you are now one of my new favorite Asian Fusion restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Last night Tottie cooked me up a special \"diet\" plate. She started with fresh steamed shrimp, chicken and dry fried those with cabbage, red pepper and onion then finished with fresh spring onion and cilantro. Let me tell you, it was amazing! No oil, no sugar, no starch but ALL flavor! 

Along side she brought me a dish of spicy Tottie sauce which is made from vinegar, chile and garlic.. again sugar free but still packed with complexity flavors and major heat! 

Tottie is just an amazing chef, owner and person. Even this morning I'm still reeling about the experience I had at Totties last night, I felt just like family."}
{"text":"De had dinner las night as a group of 10. Great appetizers, 6 main courses: I enjoyed the green papaya and chicken salad with sticky rice, both crispy beef and  crispy chicken as well as Totties fried rice. Also 3 desserts to share. Great service and without drinks, each of us paid $20.00. I shall go back when in Phoenix. Order the avocado ice cream."}
{"text":"So I came in for happy hour-my first time here- sat at the bar and was ignored by the arrogant bartender. When I finally asked if they had champagne he made some snarky comment then continued his snotty arrogant tude t/o my time at the bar. Needless to say I will never be back I couldn't get out fast enough!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and my wife and I stopped by for a late lunch on Sunday. Wasn't really sure about how it was going to be considering the restaurant was basically empty. We started off with the chicken dumplings. The dumplings were fried and served with a soy sauce based sauce to dip them in. These were good, but nothing special. The best thing that we ate was the Thai basil chicken. Fried pieces of tender chicken smothered in a sweet and savory sauce served with a bowl of white rice. This dish was $14 dollars and you can definitely share this which is nice. Service was just okay. Water kinda had a funky taste to it. I would definitely return for that fried chicken dish though."}
{"text":"Oh so good a must have when visiting AZ!

Friendly service, good food and amazing drinks!

Portions are huge and made with fresh vegetables and good..."}
{"text":"I just ate what is arguably the best Asian food I've every enjoyed, and I've traveled all thru Asia.
The eggplant has monster flavor and the braided fish and vegetables were Bomb. Portions are way too big and the best value. Definitely a must try on your list."}
{"text":"I went to Tottie's about a month ago and have been talking about it every since! And craving it too!  The food is great and everyone that works there is really nice and helpful. I got the chicken with garlic sauce and ooooooh my gosh it was so good.  Great food, great experience and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Totties on Scottsdale RD (T2) has the best cocktails. Kenta creates a new, lively, masterpiece every week!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm so impressed by this restaurant! Best Thai food I've had in a long time. I'm in from out of town and I wish I had this restaurant where I live. I ordered the pork with vegetables dish with a spice of 3. Though it was hot in spice, it was amazing!!! I highly encourage you to try this dish. It came with a salad, main entree, steamed or fried rice, and an egg roll!"}
{"text":"Wow! They don't skimp on the heat here. The menu's packed with options and the service was spectacular! Sweet, hospitable, good with selection suggestions. Nice wine selection. I hear happy hour is awesome - already starting to plan my next visit!"}
{"text":"What a mess this place is. Terrible food and the worst service. Plus they were not crowded. 
All the food were in the same sauce. I'm not even going to describe the food or what we ordered. It was that bad. 
It took forever to order then longer coming out of the kitchen. And then getting our bill. Don't bother. Ugh!!"}

I've been eating all night
And that's never too long
I think you've got fried rice
and I think I'll order some pad thai
I can handle some Thai spice
and I would like to take some home, Tottie

Hey Tottie your food is so good so good hey Tottie!  One of the best Asian fusion cuisines in town by far.  Tottie has been featured in local magazines as one of the top chefs around that valley.  That really says something and needless to say Tottie's Asian Fusion doesn't disappoint.

I suggest family style since the dishes here are large.  I'm a big fan of the Tom Yum soup, Pad See Ew, and Chiang Mai Noodles.  The level of spice is up to you.  I can hang with the best however, I'll have to pass on the Thai spice haha!  I like to be able to taste my food aside from the spiciness.

Overall, the food is excellent, but also the decors are amazing.  Local artist Gary Hostellero doesn't hold back as he displays some of his finest works around the restaurant.  Live music during the weekends and a great atmosphere makes Tottie's a place for great dining and great chill out spot. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tottie's has a huge variety and is truly a gem in this tucked away shopping center. Super cool ambiance, decent prices and great for dine-in or to-go.  Everything I've tried here is always great.  The cocktail menu at the bar is unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Nice crowd.  I have eaten here about 5 times.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated ~ pretty upscale.  The service is always friendly and helpful.  They offer a lot of lunch specials but I wanted to bring home food for my family so I ordered off the regular menu.

The pan-fried noodles with beef, chicken, and shrimp is excellent! The vegetables are fresh and crisp and there is a nice amount of meat throughout the dish.  The sauce is sweet and delicious.

Their calamari appetizer has just the right amount of spice in it.  My kids love the House Fried rice here as well as the egg drop soup.

My husband likes his food spicy which is about a 6 here (they will gladly explain the range for you and give you their suggestions).

I heard the ladies at the table next to me raving about their homemade coconut and mango ice cream (I know they make serveral flavors in house).  Will definitely have to save room for that next time!"}
{"text":"This place is nice.  I'm not big on spicy foods at all.  When I come here I end up getting the fresh spring rolls and the Pad Thai with no spice added to the flavor with shrimp and a glass of Guava Mimosa.  That sounds so bomb right now!"}
{"text":"Although this Tottie's location has been open just a few months, it's time for an update... 

We've already been a handful of times and never been disappointed.  Tottie and her staff are extremely attentive and friendly every visit.  And the food... well, I could eat here all of the time and it would never get old!  

Although our 'old standby' dishes are consistently cooked just right, we often try to order something new.  Tonight we shared the sizzle rice soup and a noodle dish that we'd never tried before... it had chow fun noodles, broccoli, bok choy, carrots, in a brown sauce.  It was delicious!

Despite being full, we also ended up trying the banana pudding... and it was the perfect sweet ending to the meal and the long day!  Each bite had just the right amount of banana, mochi, ice cream, and who knows what other surprises, but it was damn good!

***One last reason for an update: the shopping center is still undergoing major construction.  Do no let that deter you from going in.  Tottie's is staying open through it all!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend liked this place more than I did. It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of \"everything is good, just order something so I can go home\". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Pho to date! I ordered a. Hi ken and stir fried Tofu Pho. The portion is huge and the taste is a good sturdy broth! 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went here with co workers and we loved it. Great soup. I got a Marsala Indian dish and it was fabulous! Very unique and different if your looking to for a change in cuisine. Would recommended it the atmosphere is pleasurable and the service was catering and friendly."}
{"text":"Beef pad Thai is amazing! As well as the Totti rolls, always delicious and good service too!"}
{"text":"OK Chinese food, mix in the Thai and Vietnamese and lots to choose from.

Highlight for me was the chicken meatball dish was very tasty with lettuce wraps.  

Great finish with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Great drinks, service and food! Pineapple saki is great! Shumai dumplings Are a great appetizer. Chow fun noodles with beef and ALL soups are yummy! Some nights are busy but kitchen is always fast."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls - Great!  Singapore Noodles - Great!  Hot & Sour Soup - not so great - I have never had a hot and sour soup so dark!  Although the hot was hot and the sour, was sour - a little bit goes a very long way!

Definitely going back again, just skipping the hot & sour soup next time."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and people. I've been here several times and they never turned me away even 15 min before closing for take outs or eat ins.  Their customer service is superb and that's why I keep coming back. 
I very much enjoyed the pho, soups, noodle dishes, fried rice. It's making me crave it again just writing about it :) yum!"}
{"text":"I have been so impressed by this place. True authentic asian cuisine from all over Asia. I LOVE the pho and the wok dishes. The service is wonderful as well. We have become regulars since moving from San Francisco."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the portions are HUGE. We have been here a couple of times and really have enjoyed the vegetable Pho, spring rolls and the red curry. It's the kind of place that you eat until you can't eat anymore, then you continue to nibble more, then you realize you still have enough left over for another complete meal the next day. Stop reading and go enjoy the fabulous food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not as expected with some decent reviews.  I would not bother since everything was mehhh."}
{"text":"WOW! We really enjoyed our lunch. The Spring Rolls were amazing. I never had freshly made Shu Mai before........Fantastic!!!
We also ordered the Pad Lar Na with shrimp........Fabulous!!!
We will drive to tot tie's when craving Thai food. 
Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food was soooo delicious. I got the Kang Keo Wan (green curry dish) and my husband got Tottie's Pan fried noodles. Both were cooked perfectly. The spice was just right. The service was great and quick. I have no complaints about this place. If I lived in the area, I would come here all the time. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Place is soooo cute! Decorations are gorgeous and colorful. Service is great. Tottie even makes personal appearances. Food was delicious. I ordered Pad See Ew and my dad got Pad Kra Prao. Delicious and portions are huge! Service is quick and sincere. And food came out fresh from the kitchen right away."}
{"text":"Best Pho soup in town. Whenever I'm feeling like I have a cold coming on, I order their beef pho soup because of its health benefits. Love this place. Also, their Thai iced tea is excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for a Happy Hour after some work meetings in town. This place is nice, but I will say my time was ruined..as there were about 4 families, all with loud kids screaming.

Not to be rude, but I do to happy hour to unwind..and I am not sure this place did the trick. It is nice atmosphere  and very fancy, which drives the price, but  hard to enjoy fancy with babies around."}
{"text":"I could have sworn that I already reviewed Totties before but maybe not.   I've been there 3 times and the food is consistently delicious.  The restaurant itself if pretty small but I love the decor, it feels very homey, and they have a cute patio for warmer times of the year.  

First let me rave about our waitress.  We sat in Lottie's (no that's not a typo) section and she was so amazing.  She has the most warm and friendly personality, was really helpful with suggestions, didn't wince one bit for special requests, and made the whole dining experience that much more enjoyable.  Ask for her when you go there!! 

Okay, on with the food!  I went with my parents and we had the Calamari, Edamame, Pho Tai, Salmon Satay, Veggie Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and coconut ice cream.  

1. Calamari- $5 on the happy hour menu, whoop whoop! The calamari comes with a panang (I think... its like a coconut curry) sauce and the breading is extra crunchy, not oily like some fried calamari can be so that was quite delectable!

2. The Pho Tai-  my favorite. It comes with a delicious broth, noodles, and beef (I'm not really a beef person so I just ate around it).  The soup also comes with  basil, cilantro, plum sauce, siracha, and bean sprouts on the side for you to customize it which I think is very cool.  My dad and I shared a soup and asked Lottie if they could split it in two bowls and the portions were still huge.  The broth was so delicious that I just added the bean sprouts, basil, and cilantro and no sauces.  My dad added the sauces and omitted some of the other items and it was like we had two totally different soups! 

3. Salmon Satay- I was way too into my soup to care about the salmon satay (my mom ordered it).  I tried a bite just so i could yelp about it (loser, much?) but I was on food overload and so I failed on that.  Sorry! My mom wouldn't stop talking about how good it was though and it was on the HH menu for just $5. 

4. Edamame- You know what edamame tastes like.

5. Veggie fried rice- I only had like 2 bites because I was so full from the calamari and shrimp so I'll have to update this after I have it tomorrow for lunch!

6. Pad Thai- This was my first time trying Pad Thai and I really liked it!  Again, I could only fit like 2 bites in but it was tangy, sweet, and very fresh tasting.  

7. Coconut ice cream- Gahhhhhh this stuff is amazing!! Tottie herself makes it almost every day and it is sooooo good.  She uses coconut milk instead of dairy and there are little pieces of coconut in it and it is like a tropical heaven in your mouth.  Sadly, I could only have like 3 bites of this due to my prior gluttony. 

...Okay, I'll update late! But in the mean time, get your tushes to Totties! :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a pretty filling lunch, stop by tottie's! I ordered the lunch portion of orange chicken and it came with my choice of side, spring roll, and a salad. Everything tastes great. I didn't get the pleasure of dining in but the too go service was on par with the rest."}
{"text":"Best Thai in az! We come here often . The staff is really nice food always quality . Recommend the Vietnamese spring rolls .


So we've been coming to totties for years and last couple times the food was soooooooooo bad to the point of not edible . We learned that this location and Bell was sold . Tonight we ordered our usual pad kee mao and a chicken dish . Both dishes came in styrofoam containers lined with foil and the dishes were sitting in oil . The dishes resembled soup , had zero flavor . These dishes are so good that we recommend to totties to everyone . Clearly the new owners /chef were not trained enough or switched everything to a cheaper method .  We are so sad this was our favorite Thai restaurant:("}
{"text":"Uhmmm......I really want to love the place. The spicy is right, the flavors are good, but they overcooked the meat in the dish. That explains why it took so long to get the food out.

i will give it another try."}
{"text":"Ate at this resturant for the first time . Don't be afraid of the decor ....the food is fantastic and authentic . Great Thai soups and dishes . The staff was wonderful"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch.  I was seated promptly and presented with a lunch menu in addition to the regular menu.  Nice place, well decorated.  

I ordered my usual Thai delight, pad thai with chicken and brown rice.  With the lunch special you get a nice salad first which was tasty.  The bowl was a bit oddly shaped and all of the dressing fell to the bottom and it was hard to toss.  The Pad Thai was served in a huge portion with a spring roll.  It was plenty.  I ordered it \"medium\" and it was nice and spicy, so beware that their \"medium\" is pretty hot by scale.

All in all it was a great experience.  I was in and out for less than $10.00 with a full belly and smile on my face."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference. A group of us decided to eat outside of the resort and stumbled onto this place. The food was actually pretty good and the prices were reasonable. They gave us huge portions and the waitress was very nice. I ordered softshell crabs with curry. They asked how hot I wanted on a scale of 1 to 7. I ordered a six and it was pretty hot. I'm glad I didn't order the seven. One person ordered a 4.5 and it was too hot for him so he had to order something else. Everyone else enjoyed the meal very much. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner, calamari with panang curry, pad thai with large shrimp and kung pao chicken.   Everything excellent and service prompt and courteous. Definitely reccomend it surprised it wasnt full on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"This is tucked away in a strip mall. From the outside one could not tell how well decorated and large the interior is. We were pleasantly surprised. The food portion and variety were excellent. They have a full bar well I would say 3/4 of a full bar. Enough to make most drinks just not a large selection of one type of a spirit. They had a little patio out front but the view of the parking lot left me wanting more. We've been back twice and will be back again"}
{"text":"Yum, great food and flavors.  Service was quick had the sugarcane app, pad Thai and kungpao."}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the best pad Thai I've ever had! And I came all the way from the East coast! I've been here twice in less than 24 hrs! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Moving from Portland, OR. to Phoenix, it proved difficult finding a good Thai restaurant. After trying 5 or 6 different places in the valley, my husband and I tried Tottie's. Needless to say, we were blown away by the tasty, authentic-yet-original food. Safe to say it's our favorite restaurant to go to whenever we crave Thai/Asian food. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic, quality meal at a good price. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood go-to for delicious Thai food. Happy hour specials help to off-set the cost for some menu favorites."}
{"text":"Poor service had to keep asking for ..
all food cover in a DARK sauce 
Just changed the meat food was cold
Great area for 1 time guest 
Out of Townes 

We WONT back ever"}
{"text":"Totties has great decor, you can tell right when you walk in that whoever owns this place put a lot of heart into it. As good as the decor is, the food and service is just as good. I had the dumplings, and the spicy seafood soup which was suggested by the waitress Chinda. The meal was excellent full of flavor and very large portion, spicy seafood is kind of like a pho on steroids if you will. Chinda was very nice, constantly smiling, and happy to suggest her favorites and answer any questions. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Tottie's is by far the most AMAZING Asian food you can get in the Valley.  I frequent Tottie's about once a week, and it never disappoints.  My favorites are the Tottie Rolls (make sure to add in the mint and cilantro they provide on the side, it makes the difference), Green Curry with chicken, and Tom Kha Gai soup.  The Tottie rolls are just unique, and are a combination of an egg roll and lettuce wrap. A definite must try.  The curry and soup are so FLAVORFUL!!  Lots of spice and aromas....mmmm......makes me hungry just thinking about it.

I've had the pleasure of both dining in and taking the food home for takeout, and I must say that both have always been easy and wonderful experiences.  If you do eat in, I recommend trying the sugarcane chicken appetizer.  It comes with a flame to give your chicken an extra grill and a to-die-for peanut sauce; definitely something to be enjoyed in the restaurant.  Plus, the ambiance is comfortable and inviting, and the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable so it is definitely worth eating in once in awhile.

Overall, A++++"}
{"text":"This second location is closer to us then the Thomas Rd location so bonus star for that.

The food seemed consistent with the other location, portions, spiciness, flavor, everything seems to be a duplicate which is a good thing. I usually get some sort of tofu and basil dish or tofu and eggplant and it's always great. Hot is Hot (as it should be).

Not sure I love the atmosphere inside but there is nothing wrong with it, for some reason I don't like the tail ceilings here even though normally I would see it as an improvement to the space....oh well.

The portions at Tottie's are large....does anyone else think this? I always have a to-go container which is fine with me.

Sometimes Asian fusion goes wrong but I can't see anything wrong with how Tottie executes their dishes."}
{"text":"Love that they have happy hour on weekends and until 7pm. Had the Mongolian beef and chicken chow mein. Food wasn't too heavy, which we liked. We split both the items, which was perfect. Outdoor patio was great."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I am craving Thai. It's close to home and takeout is relatively painless. I love the pad-see-ew with chicken and extra broccoli. I was shocked how large the portions are...I can seriously get at least 3 meals from one order! My only negative is when I have eaten at the restaurant, service was extremely slow. I'll probably just stick with ordering takeout."}
{"text":"Tottie's Asian Fusion restaurant last night with a party of ten. The service and the food was excellent. Our server offered excellent suggestions and was quick and very attentive. We ordered five entrees and ten appetizers to be shared by all. For dessert we had to try the avocado ice cream and it was delicious!  We will definitely keep Tottie's on our list of must visit again restaurants. Thank you Tottie for an excellent dinner experience!"}
{"text":"(Review started years ago, but I'm just finishing now...)

Mom was craving for soft-shelled crabs in red curry, so I took her to her favorite place for it, but at the \"new\" location.  We've been to the one on Thomas and Hayden, which was where we discovered the delectable entree.  (For the record, I also love this dish, but I have a shellfish allergy, and I already partook in crabs a couple of weeks ago and didn't want to have a severe reaction.  I'll enjoy more crabs in May, perhaps.)  This new location, on Scottsdale Rd just south of Lincoln Ave, is gorgeous!  The entrance is kind of cramped, with the tables and decor crowding the walkway, but we got over it.  Aside from that, the interior designer did a good job with furniture, art and fabrics placement-- a feast for the eyes, which is a big part of my enjoyment when I dine out!

(Current time...)

Mom and I have tried the happy hour menu years ago, and it was OK.  I believe the offer then was $3 per app (about two bites each), or $10 for three apps.  The food portions on the hh menu seemed tiny, especially if you count that a dip saucer amount of seaweed salad would cost you $3 a la carte.  Can't recall if Mom tried the sushi-- perhaps photos will reveal that she did.  (Please cross-reference my reviews of the Tottie's on Thomas/Hayden here. https://www.yelp.com/biz/totties-asian-fusion-scottsdale-2?hrid=WkkH6VsvzPzD3-ZhzlUw7Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

Mom still enjoys the soft-shelled crab curry here and at the original location at Thomas and Hayden.  The sizes of the crabs (two crabs cut in halves) have shrunken over the years, so we've been ordering an extra side (one crab cut in half) at an additional $3.  I have given up gambling with my crab allergy for a year, or two now, as the symptoms get worse and worse that the pain and suffering aren't worth the temporary joy of eating them, but the reason I still look forward to dining with Mom here is that Tottie's is one of the very few THai/Asian restaurants I can rely on serving egg noodles as a side, at an additional cost of course, albeit very thin ones (similar to ramen).  I also love the green curry and beef lo mein!

Lastly, the fried banana and homemade coconut ice cream dessert is not to be missed.  Tottie's also serves mango and sticky rice, which I enjoyed before I tested positive for rice allergy.

(If you want a great sliced mango over black sticky rice dessert, PM me for another Scottsdale location!  Lunch UYEs here and at a non-Tottie's location, perhaps?  Let me know and we'll make them happen!)

p.s.  Don't forget to try the Thai iced tea!  Mom and I always split one, with an extra glass of ice, and I ALWAYS consider ordering a second one, but Mom always talks me out of it, which is a good decision.  Always better to leave wanting for more, than to leave feeling like a glutton and - most often than not - bloated-- ugh!  Oh, and Tottie's offers at least four different mimosa options, in lieu of the traditional champagne and orange juice.  Guava, mango, and perhaps peach, and grapefruit?  I think I tried the guava or peach once (https://www.yelp.com/biz/totties-asian-fusion-scottsdale-2?hrid=WkkH6VsvzPzD3-ZhzlUw7Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct). You may have to check older reviews for more photos).  It's OK, and I may try the mango sometime, but it's really all about the Thai iced tea, and whether you share it with someone else, or not, ask for that extra glass of ice to help water down the sweetness.  You may thank me later!  :)"}
{"text":"Nice decoration. This is the second location so there is a 2 after it. I thought the food was a little pretentious that it is your same type of Asian food but dressed up a little, yet it wasn't actually changed enough to look or taste different. There was no actual creativity or innovation that would make this a true Asian fusion place. It's more a mishmash of various Asian cuisines being available on one menu. I ordered the sampler and a couple things from the small plate menu. Everything pretty much tasted the same with no differentiation despite having different sauce pairing. The sauces didn't taste anything different than your common sauces you would get at a Thai restaurant. While the food was not terribly exciting, it was decent. I just wish the presentation would be more down to earth and just have chicken skewers be chicken skewer and not have to be served with a burner for novelty effect."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here last Sunday. 

When first driving in we were worried it was not open due to all of the construction happening in front of the building but lucky for us it was.

This restaurant has a beautiful feel as soon as you walk in. The vibrant colors, decorations and bamboo really make a lovely atmosphere.

We ordered Tottie's Fried Rice which is a combination of shrimp, chicken and beef as well as the Crispy Chicken with Thai Basil both very tasty. 

The standout of the meal was definitely the Soft Shell Crab Fresh Spring Rolls which were the most delicious rice paper rolls I have had in a long time!

I tried a Japanese beer with the meal which was also very good and my husband had a Thai beer which he loved. This turns out to be the last beer I will be having for a very long time as I just found out I am pregnant.....glad I went out with a tasty beer! lol

The dessert menu looked amazing but we were so full from our meals it was actually impossible. 

The service was perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the Hot and Sour soup it amazing!!!! Service is always an A++++ also lunch specials are cheap and taste great!!!"}
{"text":"I like totties, nothing negative to day. I like eating in the patio on a nice cool night. Everyone is friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"Amazing. Large portions. We liked the pad Thai, broccoli beef, and seafood fried noodles."}
{"text":"Walked by and decided to come in for dinner. Nice inside but sat on patio. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Had Chicken Satay which was good. Main dish was Panang Curry. The portion was huge. Wonderfully flavored and balanced dish. I enjoyed it very much. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars but since I've only eaten here once... Everything I ordered was fabulous. We ordered delivery and for that to be given 4 stars says alot. I was not too impressed with the chicken satay but that only means it wasn't what I'm used to. It seemed to be semi deep fried? Still tasty, even for delivery. The fresh spring rolls are to die for!!!  That is, if you're picky like me. I'm new to Scottsdale and in my native town (Minneapolis) fresh rolls are commonly filled with rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp and cilantro or mint. These were beyond expectations. No lettuce fillers, a nice thin wrapper, amazing peanut sauce (also not my normal standard) and the pork filling... WOW! It was to die for. In addition we ordered the Pad Thai (Thai spicy) and it was just that! None of this spicy means mild stuff here. Awesome. And huge! But the star of the show was the Panang Curry Chicken. Holy food orgasm. I love curry and this was a mild version WITH spice but extremely addicting. To end the awesome (again, I must reiterate DELIVERY) we had the mango sticky rice. Another winner. Especially to end a good spiced meal. I wish I had ordered more after all the leftovers we had. I will be back to try more and I am a food freak. Try it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to meet with a friend who was in town for the day. This was during the week, and there as a pretty good crowd there. we were seated and took advantage of their lunch specials (if I remember correctly, they have a good variety of lunch combos for $10). I had the kung pao chicken, on a 9/10 spiciness level. My friend had the chicken pad thai, I think 8/10 hot. Our food didn't take long to come out, and I was surprised at the meat - rice ratio (more meat than I thought). The only bummer was that the chicken was hardly spicy at all, but it did taste great. As far as the service, it was fine until it took about 15 minutes for us to get our check, as the server didn't even come near our table to check on us. Would I go back? Probably"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5
Happiness - 3/5

I have been looking for a great Chinese food place in Arizona since moving from the East Coast and while not \"great,\" it is definitely the Chinese Food I've had in five years (other than a ramen place in Tempe). Plus it has the added benefit of several styles of Asian cuisine so my wife gets to eat Thai food (which I detest) and I can get something I enjoy from the Chinese portion of the menu.

The portions are HUGE. While the price is also high, you do get the bang for your buck. And they don't skimp on the meat either, which I have found to be an issue at other Asian restaurants. Virtually every bite of fried rice had chicken and the ratio of broccoli to beef was 2:1 - very reasonable. An added bonus, the fried rice was not greasy at all (though by the end of the meal, the salt had dried out my mouth big time). My wife said her curry was great. And we all had leftovers.

That wait staff was very nice, although the d√©cor is pretty forgettable. There was also no kids menu (although that was fine with me as it meant I got to secretly order another dish mainly for myself). The lunch deal is especially good as the meals come with salads, rice and egg rolls."}
{"text":"My fiance wanted to take me to his go to Thai in old town but i guess they are closed on Sundays for lunch (AZ thing maybe?). It left us with a hankering for good Thai so I turned to Yelp. Tottie's popped up had good reviews so we went for it, and boy was i not disappointed! A must order is their Tottie Rolls (amazing spring rolls you wrap up in romaine with mint and Thai basil and a sweet gingery ponzu like sauce), to die for. The Tom Kah Gai is super flavorful and you can do it yourself with the spicy, 1-7. Lastly i truly believe their pad thai is the best I've ever had, i think its the noodles, super fresh great texture. I try and make it there for a meal every time i'm in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Pretty good for Scottsdale, not too dumbed down like Malees or worse yet Ling and Louie's which is Godawful.  Still not exactly authentic.
Pleasant atmosphere and waitstaff.  We'll be back due to our desperation for ethnic food."}
{"text":"I am the biggest fan of Pho.  Even when it is 110 degrees I will still eat Pho until I burst.  I am constantly looking for a place that is close by my house and that has decent Pho.  I've tried it at many places near me, and none of them are up to par with what I'm looking for.  Until Sunday night rolled around and I wasn't feeling well.  The only thing that makes me feel better is Pho.  Since my beloved Noodles Ranch is closed on Sundays and SO FAR AWAY I decided to yelp Pho in Scottsdale for the millionth time.  Up came Tottie's 2, a place I had all but forgotten because it's counterpart, Tottie's 1 is just a far as Noodles Ranch.  But alas!  There is one right down the street from me!  I quickly places my order of beef pho, calamari, and for my boyfriend...General Tsaos Chicken.  It was ready within 25 minutes...less than it takes to drive there...and when I tasted the Pho, I knew I had found an acceptable substitution for my beloved Noodles Ranch.  Totties 2 has the broth, noodles, and beef to cure any Pho craving.  The calamari was great and my boyfriend loved his dish!  I most certainly will be going to Tottie's 2 again for Pho and whatever else might tickle my fancy.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING GOOD PHO CLOSE TO MY HOUSE!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken satay skewers and Tottie rolls to start and there was only three small skewers. Most other Thai places either serves two large skewers or four smaller skewers. This was the best dish at our table so it's a shame we didn't get more. Tottie rolls had good crunch, but typical egg roll flavor so nothing special. Got the pad thai and they use a thin, fine vermicelli noodle instead of the traditional flat noodle. Also, there was too much gooey sauce that turned it into a pile of mush. Sorry, it just wasn't that great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian fusion restaurant and my go to place anytime I crave Asian food. The spring rolls are amazing and the decor is fun and I feel very relaxed in their environment. The service has always been top notch, second to none!"}
{"text":"Delicious, I had the Prau kra chicken and I loved the salad. I love sitting outside and the service is top notch here, its a real cute place."}
{"text":"Overall, food was just okay. If you're looking for authentic ThaiViet food, then this is not the place for you.

ENVIRONMENT - Great date night restaurant. Decor and ambiance is exotic. We felt seated very comfortably and could chat away without the background music or other tables being too loud.

SERVICE - Friendly and prompt.

FOOD - Both the noodle dishes just didn't feel quite right.. but that's probably why it's Asian-fusion.
+ Pho (beef and meatballs) - This was approx $8, and it was a good size, with generous amounts of beansprouts. However, this is not your traditional Pho broth - you're better off going to a legit Viet place for pho. The beef was also the thick slices of beef, which I'm not used to. Pho usually comes with the thinly sliced beef. Not a fan of this here.

+ Spicy seafood noodle soup - Approx $12. The waitress asked me the level of spiciness I preferred. I told them mild, but this noodle soup was far from mild. It wasn't even spicy at all, you can probably increase your level of spiciness if you're more tolerant.  This is a  little more on the expensive side for noodle soups... which they try to make up for it by offering more tilapia fish fillets in the noodles.  It also comes with shrimp which was not very flavourful. I don't think I'll get this again next time either...

+ Thai Iced tea - $3. This was the only item on the menu that I thought was authentic. For those who have not ordered Thai iced tea before - it's on the sweet side fyi!  

I probably wouldn't be coming back if I'm in this area.."}
{"text":"Tottie's is one of those rare restaurants that does two cuisines well - Thai and Chinese.  They may have gone overboard on the \"fusion\" part -- the Thai Fried Chicken with Basil and the Chinese General Tsao's Chicken are almost indistinguishable -- but the Thai curry and noodle dishes are distinct anyway.

The three major strengths here are:
1.  The food is uniformly well prepared and tasty.  They have even apparently lost their bread crumbs -- thank goodness -- so the fried dishes are meaty not doughy.
2.  The prices are very low.
3.  The restaurant is far more attractive than you would expect for the type of cuisine and price.

There are some rough spots, however.  Whenever there is any sort of crowd, service slows down - and it can be crowded even on a weeknight.  The menu is not imaginative at all, and many of the dishes are similar to one another.

But when you plunk down $30 for a dinner for two (the entrees are large enough so that you don't need appetisers), including tax and tip, you leave congratulating yourself for being such a clever fellow.  (I told them they should raise their prices)."}
{"text":"Staff treat you like an imposition from the moment you walk in.  Food is good but not excellent.  I would chose to spend $ and time somewhere else.

EDIT:  The owner quickly messaged me and did what he could to make things right.  His follow-up was excellent.  Im impressed and hope he and his wife give the front of the house a bit more scrutiny as the employee that set me off has worked there quite a while (maybe a bad day for her and for me?).  Nonetheless, review upgraded from 1 to 3 stars as a result as food is good and decor very good."}
{"text":"Tottie's is a great little place with a cozy atmosphere and excellent food.   If you like Asian, you'll like Totties."}
{"text":"I have come to this restaurant twice during my stay in Arizona and it is truly a hidden gem! I travel the country very often and love sampling asian restaurants as I go! This is one of the best Asian restaurants I have visited. Very delicious, ample food and accommodating service. Go give them a try!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a lunch or dinner at Tottie's, very friendly staff nice happy hour."}
{"text":"MMMMM. Let me break it down for you...when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying \"oh wow, that looks amazing\" as plates are coming up in the window, you're in for a treat. I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....! Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).

Know Before You Go:  I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks! Big fan."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 dishes take out. Vegetable Fried rice was amazing. Sweet and sour chicken had good flavor but the chicken was really dry. Hunan Beef had good sauce and vegetables but the Meat was inedible.  Very weird texture and tuft to chew.  Dragon noodle was good but again the chicken that was added was really dry.  Still looking for good Chinese near Old Town."}
{"text":"awful. FOOD IS GROSS, you do not know what you are eating.  It is not good at all."}
{"text":"Totties. .. oh how to explain the greatness.
my most recent order was:
I got the lamb salad. It was regreshing, filling and loced it. And I hate salads. 

I am also a huge fan of their curries. Whats best about this location is that it isnt as \"sketchy\" on the outside add the south Scottsdale location. Yhe outside matches the inside on this one."}
{"text":"I loved the original Tottie's so much, I just had to check this out.  The food is delicious and portions are very generous.  It was quicker to get a table, but the prices are slightly higher at this location.  It must be because it's in the Paradise Valley area.  After discussing various dishes that I hadn't tried, the server suggested the Pad Thai.  It didn't disappoint me at all, and that's saying a lot since I'm particular about the flavoring of this sauce.  It was more than I could eat, I wish I could've taken it with me, but I was going to an event afterwards.  I'll return to this location, but probably earlier or later as it's hard to find a parking space in this popular place 7 to 8:00pm."}
{"text":"Don't come into Tottie's expecting traditional cuisine. What you'll get here is that traditional dish that you wanted, with Tottie's own interpretation on it. She prepares Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Sushi, with the Tottie twist on it. 

The atmosphere has a lot left over from when this used to be the French fine dining spot Methode Bistro. It's cozy, warm, casual, and very inviting and Tottie is a very friendly lady who loves to talk bout food, share ideas, and greet all of her customers. In fact, I was not having the best of experiences here until Tottie came over to see me, since her servers had zero knowledge of the Asian dishes they were serving people, but Tottie was a little more knowledable. Scratch that, a lot more knowledgable.

My Bun Thit Nuong Tom Cha Gio was presented in a way that was very different, using traditional ingredients but with a few extra ideas thrown in like field greens, extra carrots, and a little different style of presentation. The server informed me, upon finding out how much Vietnamese I eat, that I would find this dish very different because it came with a unique Tottie Sauce...... it was traditional Nuoc Mam, LOL! Despite the confusion, the food was top, top, top quality. Very fresh and crisp veggies, good cuts of pork, huge shrimp, and crisp egg rolls. I was truly happy with the dish, despite it being different from what I'm used to. 

At the price point $10 a bowl of Bun Thit, it's one of the more expensive fixes in town, but given the quality and atmosphere, I'd go here again and not think twice about the extra couple of bucks."}
{"text":"Great deal on appetizers but they're pretty small and mediocre.

The pho has an excellent broth but the quality of ingredients really left something to be desired, I'd definitely revisit for the pho but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian restaurants in the valley. 

When you first visit you will notice that the decor and lighting is superb - suitable for a date night. The staff are gracious. Most importantly tho, the food here is fantastic. From the spring rolls and kung pao to the egg drop soup. Every meal I watched come out (to other tables) looked better and better. Now that I trust them I will return to sample some less clich√© dishes.

This also happens to be one of the least expensive lunch places in the area."}
{"text":"Driving south from the Grand Canyon on a Sunday morning, we were late for lunchtime and hungry.  Tucked away in a small strip mall was this location of Tottie's, and what a \"find\" it was.

The d√©cor at Tottie's is pleasantly understated and quite attractive.  Table placement and noise levels don't detract from the dining experience.  With an emphasis upon the cuisines of Thailand and Vietnam, the menu is geographically varied and large.  Yet, contrary to the current trend of Pan-Asian bistro restaurants, portion sizes are ample.  The food is satisfying, generally authentic and aesthetically plated.  As a guide, the kitchen uses an Asian standard of spiciness; \"moderate\" heat will pack a punch, albeit one which we found to be agreeable.

Lunch began with a shared appetizer of Vietnamese-styled rice paper summer rolls.  In comparison to others that I've eaten, these were uncommonly thick, and a bit difficult to eat out-of-hand.  Shrimp, shredded pork and mint were apparent, but an overenthusiastic use of vegetables muted their flavors.  The accompanying peanut sauce was successful in balancing the flavors, but was a bit under-seasoned in its own right.

An entr√©e of red Panang beef curry was true-to-form in its Thai seasoning.  Accents of lemongrass and galangal, two aromatics often omitted from corner-cutting preparations, were apparent.  If a bit heavy in its liquid portion, the dish was otherwise spot-on.

The salmon filet in a basil and ginger sauce was both generous and quite tasty.  Very well balanced in its seasoning, yet not overpowering the taste of the fresh fish, this dish was an unconditioned success.

Shrimp Pad Thai rounded out our shared lunch entrees.  Ample in portion, a vermicelli noodle was used.  Pad Thai is best judged by how effectively the kitchen balances the key flavors of sweet, spicy, salty and sour, and lesser substitutions for tamarind sourness is usually where the preparation suffers.  In this case, however, slight demerits go to an inadequate representation of the sweet component-- perhaps the easiest area to master.  Although a bit unbalanced, the shrimp Pad Thai was still very good.

Our server, Rain, was enthusiastic, pleasant and prompt.  Before adding a generous tip for her services the tab for this enjoyable lunchtime feast for 4 totaled under $55; an excellent value for the dining experience received."}
{"text":"Amazing food, good atmosphere, perfect prices. We had Kang Keo Wan (green curry) & Pad Kee Mao, both with chicken. Huge portion for the curry, plenty of leftovers. Great fresh vegetables. Spice level options 1-7. Good drinks, fast service. 2 happy hour drinks, an appetizer, & 2 entrees: $42 = VERY satisfying first visit. We will return..frequently."}
{"text":"The food was delicious (I got the Tangerine Beef) and the service was great. I was with a group of 20+ women and they split up the check for us so we could each pay separately. That was really considerate and saved us a lot of hassle. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"On a business trip and found TAF2 on Yelp.  Great food.  Shocked with the portion sizes.  I have never not been able to polish off an order of Yellow Curry in one sitting...until Totties.  Dishes are large enough for 2 to share."}
{"text":"Oh sodium... how I love to hate you...

On a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area we went. My wife and I love Thai food but I try to limit the frequency to avoid over eating. Michael, our server, was incredible and made us feel like guests of honor. The decor is unlike any other Asian place - there was attention to detail and very clean.

The Tottie rolls are a must get and quite filling. We also got the string beans, well cooked I must say, the Panang curry, and the Pad Pra Kow beef. All of is was really good.

I highly recommend this place and for those who are sensitive to sodium, stay away from the curry dishes."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai food restaurant here in the valley! Their menu is so extensive it caters to most all Asian cuisine! I live in Tempe but travel 20+ mins out of my way to eat here!"}
{"text":"Just come here. The food is amazing, the HH is beyond reasonable but more importantly for me, the owner and associates are kind, lovely people."}
{"text":"Tottie's is the best Asian food hands down. Tottie is the owner and chef and she is an incredibly hospitable individual. Native to Laos, (nearly all) her recipes have been passed down throughout her family. The food and service are always wonderful. Tottie really has an eye for style. She is always dressed to the nines and the interiors of both her restaurants are stunning. The ambience is soothing, making it the perfect place to unwind (especially on the patio). I prefer this location, but both are stocked with sushi/full bars. This location boasts Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese. The menus at T1 & T2 differ, as some dishes are offered at one location but not the other. A couple favorites of mine include the panang, shrimp puffs, Tottie rolls, Tom Kha Gai soup, wonton soup, mixed veggies, dragonfly noodles, Schezwan noodles, shu mai....can you tell it's my favorite? You can't go wrong here. 

PS Amazing lunch specials + munchies menu"}
{"text":"Just as wonderful as its other location... not sure why its called #2, it is pretty much identical to the other Totties... but either way i can get over the name dilemma because i love me some Totties! anything you get is good, you really cannot go wrong. the tangerine chicken is out of this world btw !"}
{"text":"Some of the best panang curry I've eaten.  Always right on with the spice level, service is great and it's a nice relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Alert: every dish that involves sauce is bubbling tar pit of sodium and sugar. You'll need to reserve three hours to nap afterwards, and maybe another hour for rolling around, glassy eyed and confused about where you are.

The crispy tofu pad thai, tangerine shrimp, and soft shell crab curry are definitely tasty... but I'd rather down a triple scoop sundae if I'm going to go into a food coma afterwards, regardless."}
{"text":"I'm glad dropped in at the right time and got to enjoy some sweet HAPPY HOUR deals!

Food: 
1) edamame: moderate sized bowl for happy hour price!
2) Ribs: you get two of them and they are tender and well slathered with BBQ sauce. Pretty good, but seemed out of place at a Thai restaurant. 
3) chicken and shrimp Sui Mai: I like how it was different from the regular pork sui mai, it had a real piece of shrimp on top which was a nice touch. 
4) Pad se ew: Good flavor! I liked how they book different vegetables in this dish. Well made and good execution!
5) Beef Larb: Not one of my favorites. It was sour...in a funny way. I didn't enjoy it too much. I think they need to work on the sauce of this dish. I wasn't even really sure if the beef was tender or not because I was too distracted with how weird it tasted.  
6) Tom Yum Soup: Lots of ingredients! Very generous with the shrimp! I liked the presentation! It came on FIRE! 

Service: 
Friendly. No complaints. Checked on me several times and was good about refilling my water. 

Ambiance: 
A little dim for my taste, but I guess they were going for a romantic ambiance. I had a hard time seeing what I was eating. 

Price: 
Typical for Thai food. The whole meal came out to be $50. 

Overall: 
It was pretty good, but I don't know if it was good enough to come back. I might come back just for happy hour. There's some good deals on that menu!"}
{"text":"Oh delicious Chinese food, I can't even begin to express my adoration for you.

Thai food, I crave you.

Viet food, you're so delightful and flavorful.

A three-way fusion at Totties? What?

Oh yes. We're talking burning desire going on here.

Standout are the veg spring rolls, spicy cucumber salad and bean curd/veggies stir fry that may not look so exciting on the menu, but it did unspeakable things to my taste buds. 

The Shanghai bordello atmosphere is the perfect backdrop to the entire shebang, I mean, experience."}
{"text":"The best Asian food in AZ! My out of state friends always want to visit Totties as soon as they get here. It does not get any better than this, anywhere!"}
{"text":"Visited today after seeing great reviews. They lived up to all the positive reviews. Had the fresh Spring Rolls which I could have made a meal out of. They were crammed full of goodness and the peanut dipping sauce was equally fantastic too.

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. My sever asked what level of spice I wanted. I ordered medium spice and it was spot on. Came with lots of sprouts, carrots and crushed peanuts. So tasty. Large enough serving that I have dinner ready to go! Excellent food and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials in this cozy asian cafe'.  You feel as if you are on a vacay away when you dine here.  I enjoyed the Pad Thai which was bright and fresh with just the right amount of heat.  It came with a zippy salad and a crisp eggroll.  You could eat here several times a week and have something different every time."}
{"text":"It's becoming more obvious to me that these reviews fluctuate not as much from each persons experience, but from some peoples attitudes. I think some reviewers enjoy being constantly disgruntled.
That being said - beautiful decor, very unique art on display, friendly and attentive staff, quick service, HUGE portions and the food itself was phenomenal. Fried tofu, pad Thai, vegetarian fried rice, cucumber salad and spring rolls were all ordered and absolutely everything was top notch. In the cooler months I would love to dine on the patio - tons of lush greenery - doesn't even look like Arizona. Awesome happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers as well."}
{"text":"Good! I wouldn't say the best place but it's definitely solid. Pretty pricey though. I may be forced to go somewhere else based on price alone.


*** Update: the last few orders have been pretty bad. Their chow mein is inconsistent. Last order had way too much sauce and drowned everything else. General Tao's was a tiny portion, they are stingy on the rice and the Kung Pao was terrible. No flavor. Spent almost $50 on sub-par food and didn't even have left overs. Time to find a new place."}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese food ever.  NOT authentic.  Broth tasted worse than instant noodles.  That homemade ice cream was a joke.  Chunky and not smooth.  Very poor consistency.  Sorry, the food was pathetic.   Never again.  Service was good, otherwise."}
{"text":"BEST ASIAN FOOD IN THE VALLEY!! Panang curry is so delicious! I get the 3 on hotness with chicken and shrimp! Seriously amazing!
Sushi is excellent too! Love you Tottie!"}
{"text":"Wow! I love love love this restaurant. We went on a Saturday night and it was not too crowded. We were seated right away in the table that we chose and they brought out water right away. Our server was the nicest lady. We ordered every dish based on her recommendations and she did not disappoint. We started with the lemongrass spring rolls which were perfect. Light and healthy, and delicious. For our main course, I ordered the green curry with chicken and my husband ordered the red curry with chicken. Both were phenomenal and both were huge. I can't decide which one I like better. So so yummy. And we have lunch tomorrow, too, so many leftovers. Yum yum yum. Anytime I am in the area I will eat here. You should do the same. The best Thai I have ever had, by a clear mile."}
{"text":"The whole experience is amazing! Totties has an amazing and very high end Asian atmosphere and fantastic food to go with it. They even grow their own herbs and some other items in a garden out back. We've been here twice and the staff has been great too. Totties holds my heart when it comes to Thai food in the valley!"}
{"text":"Have been going here and to her other location for many years. Excellent food fresh ingredients with a mix of different Asian cultures. Definitely worth checking out if you've never had their food before."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we would try Totties based on a number of favorable reviews. Since moving to Scottsdale from San Diego, this is our first try at a local Thai restaurant. The place was tastefully decorated and very clean. The wait staff were some of the nicer people I have encountered in a restaurant. We arrived during happy hour so we were able to enjoy some nice and strong cocktails for five bucks a pop. 

We both skipped appetizers and dived right into the main courses. I ordered the Kang Keo Wan with mussels- a spicy green curry dish. I have been skimped on seafood at other places yet my dish contained 10 LARGE and fresh mussels. A very good dish I must say. My wife ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp. Her's was tasty, spicy, and the noodles were not over cooked. When we first try a Thai restaurant we go for the curries and Pad Thai dishes. If they can make those to our taste, then we usually return to try other things...we will be back! Additionally, their fried banana with ice cream was the bomb!

If I had any complaints here they would be that the Thai tea wasn't the best I have had.

Op/Ed-

      I get quite tired of people whining in every Thai Restaurant review regarding the lack of \"authentic\" or \"traditional\" fare, throwing these terms about as if they were in downtown Bangkok or something. I accept the fact that I live in the southwest. All I expect is great tasting food at reasonable prices. Totties 2 was very good at accommodating these simple requests."}
