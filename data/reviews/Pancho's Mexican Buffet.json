{"text":"It hurts me to have to give Pancho's a mere 2 stars, because I used to go here almost every weekend back in 94 as a kid. Many memories. I can't say I remember much about the food, I ate it with no complains because I was just a kid and didn't know any better, but I've been back there a few times since then including a couple months ago. This time the food was less than palatable. Some of the food, like the chimichanga and the flautas, kinda tasted like they had been fried in rancid oil, and I am prone to believe so because I developed a bit of a stomach ache toward the end of the meal. Also, the width of the tamales were straight up laughable: the width of an index finger. On the plus side, the place is like a time machine; walk in and you'll think O.J. is on the run in his white Ford Bronco again, hurry and turn on the news, because its 1994 all over again! Not a thing has changed; same decor, including the paintings of sombrero totting men on the walls as you walk in, except for the fact that these paintings now have a protective plastic or glass cover. I like the fact that it hasn't changed. Brings back more vivid memories; going here on the weekend with my mom and her then Cuban boyfriend, and getting scolded by her to not eat so many darn churros, walking out with a Pancho's balloon in one hand and an ice cream cone for the road in the other hand, standing in front of one of the statues against the wall in the parking lot and looking up and snickering because someone stuck gum in one of his nostrils and it looks like snot. I would return here believe it or not, just for the memories it brings back, but I wouldn't return for a couple of years when maybe the food has changed for the better. Hopefully."}
{"text":"It wasn't what I remember when I was younger.
But it was just okay.
I wish they had burritos, but they don't.
Just average mexican food.
I think it was like 18 bucks for 2 people and one drink.
They have an ice cream bar, but it's not as wonderful as it used to be.
They used to have gummy worms. Now all I can remember is sprinkles.
No churros either.

My taco was missing something, it didn't taste beefy at all.
Even though that's all that was in their..beef..

All they had playing was Hispanic music. Which I don't really mind, but I wish they had a different variety.

I like my chile rellano though. Beans were a little dry, but I wasn't really expecting much."}
{"text":"Mexican food should not be served buffet style, it just doesn't do it service.
This place isn't even traditional buffet, you don't serve yourself, per say.

That said, this is not Mexican food. Imagine Taco Bell trying to open a sit down Mexican restaurant and then doing a worse job than you would expect. That place would still be better than Pancho's. The only thing I even kind of liked there were the sopapias (or is it sopapillas?).

If you like canned nacho cheese, frozen tamales and diabetes, eat at Pancho's."}
{"text":"Been their once and would never return.  First it is not a buffet.  It should be named \"Pancho's Mexican Kitchen Line.\"  This place makes Taco Bell seem gourmet!  Everything is low grade and perpetuates the stereotype that Mexican food is of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing peoples view of Mexican food because I am a good cook.  But this has to be of the lowest quality I have come across.  All the Filibertos, Ramiros and Armando's are extremely better than this place."}
{"text":"It's ok if your hungry but taco bell tastes better. It's a buffet, so don't expect the best. Beans are dry and taste like they came from a can. Rice is bland. Enchiladas are gross. Sadly the best thing they offer is the sopapillas at the end. Drizzle with honey and your in heaven. For the price and amount of food you can get, it's ok. But if you want flavorful authentic Mexican food, keep on driving. 

Also, a bit of warning. Both me and my roommate at the time, both ended up with upset stomachs after eating here. Did we eat too much? Its possible. Was it the food? probable.

Note: Please don't mistake this BUFFET place for the authentic, sit-down restaurant on Central Ave in south Phoenix. Ponchos in South Phoenix has excellent, authentic and really tasty 'home-cooked' style food. 
This buffet place? Well, again, think of Taco Bell, cafeteria style.

While its not HORRIBLE, its not very good. Save your money."}
{"text":"I am 36 years old and have been eating at Panchos for at least 32 of those years, It is really really good... It may not be authentic Mexican Food but it is still very good for what it is and an excellent value.  I always look forward to going there, and I dont think anyone should be so harsh on it, It definately beats Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Sub par. Go to Taco Bell instead. This place is terrible! Apparently it holds some memories for my wife (\"It used to be good\"), but it was not good.  All the food is bland and basically just filler. Stay away."}
{"text":"I will miss this place!"}
{"text":"Not quite the insult to Mexican food that taco bell is... but also not as good as taco bell once you accept that you aren't eating Mexican food."}
{"text":"The Red stew and the Sopapillas are the Best my wife and myself have ever had.
Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to be. If I wasn't sleeping or in the pool. I was eating  @ this place! Just put up your little flag for more food! Aaaah!"}
{"text":"I like to goto this place for the tacos to go. They have a special 4 tacos for $2.75 and I have been getting them here on and off for years. Tacos are on the level of Taco Bell but the salsa is alot better and for $2.75 it's a nice snack where I'm in the mood for it. These days I don't live close to Panchos anymore so I very rarely go but yesterday I was nearby and in the mood. Still the same.."}
{"text":"It's 2017 and I am still super sad that this placed closed down. It randomly popped into my head so decided to leave an RIP review. I still haven't had better enchiladas (except for my momma's) anywhere else. We used to come here on Sundays after church and man was it the best part of my day. The sopapilla's were amazing and I just hope that some generous person reads this and decides to reopen the place haha x)"}
{"text":"There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger & wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse & worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report & they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea & good location could have done allot better!"}
{"text":"This place is just \"meh\".  Sure it's pretty cheap and the people that work there are nice and helpful but in a city with so much more to offer, it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"some restaurants are forever connected to your childhood. and if you hadn't been privy to the 'happy birthday song' over the loudspeaker and a free pinata, you aren't going to understand why this place was in business for so long.
also. the sopapillas were fantastic. so stop staying everything was terrible. ha.
i really don't care what you all say.
i love you, pacho's. farewell, my sweet, dirty buffet prince."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Mexican Food I have ever had. I never thought I would say this but your better off going to the McDonalds across the street."}
{"text":"Over the years this place has experienced a sharp decline from a place people used to want to take their kids for birthday parties and dinner after church on Sunday. It now is mostly crowed by those who are just looking for cheap food and a lot of it. Poncho's used to run commercials stating they were an all you can eat buffet but during my last trip I noticed that the eat all you want spirit had been crushed and thrown out the back door with the trash. 

Seriously with as much time as it takes for them to see your little flag on the table and to bring you the food item you requested you will lose intrest or just give up and and hit the taco bell drive through on your way home.

The server I had did her best to keep up with the huge level of requests she was being given but seemed tired and mad most of the time. Kind of made me wish I could just go up there and just get what I wanted just so she would not have to. That is the way it used to be and I wish they would go back to that policy but they will not because they know you will eat less that way. 

The one thing that would make me even want to step foot in the door would be the basket of chips and salsa they give along with the little pillows of goodness also known as sopapillas that are served with honey. To be honest most kids will still like this place as they do serve food that they like such as tacos and also have a sundae bar with soft serve ice cream and tons of toppings. But if you are like me and do not want to have to suffer for cheap food just skip this place on by."}
{"text":"Rand H. and I stopped in the other day and I realized something about Mexican buffets and myself, they don't mix! Here's why ... when it comes to Mexican food I ALWAYS order the same thing! A Carne Asada Burrito that's my delectable choice when I choose Mexican food, often from a roach coach!This spot was no help in changing that personal tradition!
Someday someone may be able to enlighten me, and I'll let go of my  mono mindedness for these particulars of preference."}
{"text":"omg where to start.. no hotsauce, nasty greasy dry over cooked cafateria style food. brown lettuce, improperly labeled soups, i thought i was getting chicken tortilla soup i got meuendo (intestine soup) barf.. the chile releno was like a sponge filled with grease. all the chimichongas were over cooked and dry, all the flautas and taquatos were way over cooked..  the enchalads were gross it was nothing but corn tortillas covered in cheese whiz no fillings inside. i wrote a letter to panchos telling them about my poor experience there and the manager wrote me back telling me it was my fault about the soup cuz on weekends they do meuendo and i should have known this as a first time customer. also she told me theres no hot sauce because they dont put them on the table anymore cuz customers steal them. i wouldnt send my worst enemy to this resturant. also the tamales claimed to be red or green sauce yet there was neither inside either one of them. so gross so nasty also the place was dingy and dirty. like a dive mexican resturant with bad food.."}
{"text":"What can I say about Panchos... its a buffet with lots of mediocre Mexican food. Upon first entering the strange multiple sectioned building with lots of loud colors on the walls, you must enter a cafeteria style line and pick what you would like. Here, you have all kinds of stuff to choose from: greasy chili rellenos (aka cheese sponges), several types of enchiladas, tamales, small chimichangas, flautas and taquitos, rice, beans, tacos, and tostadas. The cost is pretty reasonable for all the food you can get and if you like non authentic greasy Mexican food made with lots of trans fat, this might be an ok deal for you. Once seated, you can obtain more items from the buffet simply by raising a little flag at your table. I will admit, this might just be the best idea ever! You raise this flag and the waiters are standing at your table literally seconds later. If only all restaurants would get on board with this! All in all, Panchos is an alright spot for a large unhealthy meal. The service is always good thanks to the flag system and it actually seems like a fairly clean restaurant. Also, who can resist fresh hot sopapillas after your meal? I know I can't, which is why I reluctantly agree to go to Panchos when the hubby asks (he loves those cheese sponges)."}
{"text":"In my family, Pancho's is a definition of a specific style of Mexican food. Nope, it's not good, +but it's acceptable, cheap and overflowing food.
There are times that My Bride will specifically say she wants Pancho's Mexican. Other times we want Real Mexican, other times Tex-Mex, and rarely Del-taco/Taco bell Mexican.

Pancho's is steps above Taco Bell, a distant relative to (bad)Tex-Mex  and they have almost nothing to do with real Mexican.  
As the other reviewers stated, all you can eat, fun flag to raise for refills (kids love it) sopapeas are quite wonderful and fresh, like a beignet sort of.  The specific food choices dont matter in a place like this much like a cafeteria, food is food.  But if it's nearby, and you have a few kids to pay for, this is a fine way to please everyone who isn't expecting great food. $6 a person to eat out? And you dont have to eat in a car? Expectations should be set at that level, and you will be happy.

I admit that I enjoy it, but it's like admitting you like the McRib. Is that a real rib? Don ask, and bask in the wretchedness of awesome. 

It's a 5 star place, because it invented it's own definition of food, I just cant click on more stars and consider myself a trustworthy eating human. It's a 1 star joint, unless it's your poison of choice, then it's 4 stars of embarrassing guilty pleasure.

Enjoy or avoid, hope this helped in some way."}
{"text":"To say Panchos sucks is a huge understatement.

It is gag reflex bad buffet food. I went back to the buffet a couple times just hoping there was something edible.  I must have thrown three full plates away.

Stay away! Go anywhere else.  I had to go out of my way to tell people not to even bother with this place!"}
{"text":"Okay beside the fact that this is not real mexican food it was just sad to even call it food, on my first visit i made it my last the food is disgusting but i managed to eat something. . Then on my way out was the worst part i went to wash my hands and the bathroom was the worst thig i had ever seen there was vomit and shit everywhere seriously a health and safty violation please don't bother bringing ur family or friends here unless u want diarrhea!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me???!!! Do they really call this Mexican food?!!!! WOW, cant believe its food. Only thing i liked in there was the sodas and the sopapillas, that's it. Everything else was not a pleasant taste!!!! 

I would not recommend this place what so ever!!!"}
{"text":"I went there with a coupon for BOGO buffets. My stomach wishes I hadn't. Some of it was better than other. The service was great. The cheese Enchiladas were disgusting. The Sopapillas were good, the icecream??? was funny tasting. With the coupon it was still about $17 for two with two softdrinks and a tip, so I say skip it and go somewhere else. Your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"I don't get all the negativity! We went there..  me, my guy, my son, and my daughter. 20 bucks. No joke. And it's not gross. Some of the enchilada sauce was a little closer to ketchup, but it really wasn't bad. I loved some of it, and the sopapillas in themselves bumped this place up a star. Mmmm with honey and sugar right there on the table for ya. This was a good idea, I'm glad we went. Oh, and the waiter was so nice. Everyone in there was super nice. The owner told me ways to try the sopapillas when I went up for more. 
I'm rating this as a BUFFET, because that's what it is. Did you really expect gourmet in a mexican buffet? come on.."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me."}
{"text":"There's no use in pretending Pancho's is a haven for good Mexican food, you know it isn't, it's a haven for the fatties and college kids. I made many a stop at Pancho's during my college years, and on my most recent nostalgia filled trip I realized it just isn't the same anymore. Same less than good food, same little flags you raise, same sopaipillas you want to eat until you vomit, but now I have a steady paycheck and access to whatever food I'd like, so it's not all that exciting anymore. I didn't even eat until I thought I'd die... sad day. But look, Pancho's fills the niche it's shooting for perfectly, you're getting all you can eat Mexican food for a few dollars, you can't expect to be served food comparable to The Mission, it's going to be cheap and underwhelming, but TONS of cheap and underwhelming. I'll be stopping by here every rare once in a while, just for old times sake, but if you're in college and lacking money, or a fatty trying to support your habit, Pancho's is A-OK."}
{"text":"It's not what Pancho's use to be ... back in the day, or from what I remembered, but it is what it is.  Its faster (not fast food) Mexican.  I love the set up, and the amount of food you get, but if you are looking for quality - you won't find it here.  Just average."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on the recommendation of a friend of ours who works at Fiesta Mall. We just happened to stop by near his lunch hour and enjoyed a nice, quick lunch at Pancho's with him.

I had never even heard of this place before but boy did I enjoy it! Upon first entering, you can pick up a tray and pay for your meal. It was very inexpensive, under $6 a person. You can then go down the line and the servers behind the buffet will dish out what you ask for. After you are seated there is a salad area as well as a delicious dessert area. Once you finish your food, you can raise the small flag at your table and ask the server for anything you like - definitely be sure to try out the sopapillas! They are huge, fluffy and absolutely delicious.

I tried each dessert, as is my habit, and liked all of them. The sopapillas and flan are my favorite. As for the main course, my favorite of the choices was the chicken soft taco.

I think this will be our regular lunch spot when we are near the Fiesta Mall area of Mesa."}
{"text":"There's a bit of nostalgia for some people when they talk about Pancho's Mexican Buffet. And, I suppose this is the best Mexican buffet that I've been to.

The three-star rating is not a knock to the quality of the food, service, or cleanliness of the restaurant. All of that is, fine; it's a buffet after all. It's a little different in that they serve you cafeteria style and if you \"raise the flag\" on the table the servers will come to refill your drinks, reload your entrees, and bring sopapillas (with honey!). If you're not super familiar with their offerings, make sure you take a good look on your first time through, so you know what to ask for.

It's pretty busy and there's a lot of turnover so the food was all very fresh, but nothing was really excellent. The best thing is the sopapillas; fresh squares of fried dough, drizzled with honey. They're really good.

The food is not really authentic mexican, but it's a few steps closer than fast-food Taco Bell / Del Taco.

Bottom line, if you had a big group with kids and want to have a sit-down dinner with okay all-you-can-eat food that isn't too expensive, Pancho's is pretty good."}
{"text":"Do you remember how Pancho's used to taste? Keep that memory and don't go again."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever undertaken, and I'm including that apartment in the ghetto I signed a lease for because it was \"quaint\" and multiple men I really shouldn't have given as much of a chance as I did.

Boyfriend and I thought we'd relive our childhood involving Pancho's from when we lived in North Phoenix and went to the one by Metrocenter. I had a birthday party at that one, and my party went to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer before eating (I'm talkin' Kristy Swanson here... yeah, totally super sweet). We both recalled fond memories of raising the little Mexican flag to get sopapillas.

Walking in, and seeing that margaritas are not served as they should be, it was the ultimate in regret. 

me: \"Let's just go to Arriba. They don't have margs here, and that's really the only reason I wanted Mexican.\"
man: \"Oh, come on. Where's your sense of adventure? I think I'll have a beer. (seeing look of disappointment on my face) Ohhhhkay, do you want to go to Arriba?
me: (downtrodden) No, I guess we'll stay here.

We exit the line, $20 lighter, and find a seat. This place is filthy. The server, who calls me \"mija\" at least 18 times, I find delightful for the first time she says it. Then I hear her saying it to all of the other females at her tables. Cheating bitch. The extensive salsa line looks awesome, and I perk up a little, like, maybe this won't be so bad.

WRONG. WRONG. WRONG.

It WAS bad. Everything was bad. The half naked children screaming, the white people everywhere thinking this is the bees knees of Mexican cuisine... it all adds up to probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. We promptly went to Arriba and drank a marg very quickly to forget about the pain."}
{"text":"We started with Pancho's about 1970 when we lived in the Northeast part of Phoenix.  We went to the one at Metrocenter (now closed).  The one in Mesa is our \"go to\" Poncho's now because our daughter and son-in-law live in Mesa.

We raised four kids with visits to Pancho's.  And this is its genius.  It's designed for families.  Get it?  The food is good, service fast, servers friendly and you can take a party of 12 without scaring them or you to death.  I did so last January and we all had a ball.  Went in July too, when we were there for a visit.

Our kids always fought over who's gonna raise the flag.  They absolutely adored the sopapillas.  If you don't get honey on your elbow, you're not doin' it right.

If we want real Mexican food, we go to a mom and pop somewhere near.  If we want the Pancho's experience and price tag, we go to Pancho's!"}
{"text":"I have a stomachache, for GOOD reasons, not bad.  I was enjoying myself so much here that I overate.  Did I catch Pancho's at a good time, or are my standards just different that those of the other people who have been to this place?

Check my review of Valle Luna for my list of the five types of Mexican Restaurant.  This one classifies as a Type D: Chain-type sit-down restaurant.  Poncho's is more unusual because it's a buffet.

They were almost empty when we visited on Sunday night.  Service was very friendly, and the food tasted great.  No, it wasn't gourmet by any standard, but I went there expecting a Mexican buffet and was quite pleased.  I never saw a cheese enchilada with cheese both outside and inside before--it was almost a mac 'n' cheese-style enchilada.  Rice and beans were actually better than a lot of places I've visited.  Pretty authentic style.  Chips and salsa were so good I ate WAY to many of them, and the sopapillas were primo.

The price was rock-bottom, and just incredible for all you can eat food.  Great for kids (and the price is lower for them too).  Sorry, but I can't connect with the plethora of one and two-star reviews that dominate Pancho's board here on Yelp.  Yes, I think that if this place were crowded and packed to the gills with kids, it would have been a less pleasurable experience, but as it was, I enjoyed every bite.

Thanks Pancho's--I raise my cup and the flag to you.  Some appear to despise you, but I do not count in that number.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had not expected anything fabulous.  It is what it is.  Cheap, not steller, food.  But quick and kinda cool that you can choose whatever you like and then YOU don't have to go back for more, your wait person will do it for you.  You just ttell them what you want and they will get it.  So if all you like here are tacos....just gorge yourself on tacos!  It's really not a bad  deal and if you have a family with teenagers who want to eat everything in site...well, here is the place for you!  The place was clean although I did not use the restroom so I can't comment on that.  

I spoke with the manager as we were leaving and he was very personable and seemed open to constructive critisism.  Apparently he just took over.  So, if you go knowing this is not going to be the best mexican food in town, then it's fine.  Not a bad value.  

Thanks Panchos."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This cheap mexican buffet restaurant located in downtown phx off indian school not only has some major decor updated to consider indoors (which was the least of their worries) but the taste and quality of food was questionable as to how they are still in buisness... needless to say the food was pretty horrible and that conclusion can BEFORE i saw the dead cockroach squshed on the floor as i entered their out-dated and filthy bathroom. 

it all started upon the first  walk into the large size restaruant,  the over whelming smell of disgusting over cooked oil filled the air. Thinking a mexican buffet is a great concept because i thought yeah! i can finally put together my taco or dish together how i want...wrong!...the \"buffett line\" has staff serving you food \"lunch lady style\". :( yet the desserts and salad bar are free for all. why i continued through the line i do not know, was hoping this \"hole in the wall' could possibly be worthy of something with all the people lining up. i could go on, but id just be repeating what others already reviewed...your better off going down the street to Regio's (go west towards SR51 to arrive at 1702 E. ind School rd) , fast food mexican, similar to filebertos, armandos, all that good stuff! :) you'll be much happier you did!!!! enjoy"}
{"text":"The Northeast is bereft of good Mexican food, much to the dismay of Little Brother and I, who reside in Boston and New York respectively and have nicknamed each other \"Salsa.\" So when Little Brother and I took a  trip to Arizona in February, we vowed to eat Mexican food at least once a day, every day of our five day stay in the Sunshine State.

One day we were in the car, looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for Pancho's Mexican Buffet.  Little Brother and I were smitten instantly and demanded to stop there ASAP.  Apparently we were the only ones in our family who had such amorous feelings for Pancho's.  We begrudgingly ate somewhere else but the next day Little Brother and I borrowed the rental car from our mom and headed to Pancho's for lunch, accompanied by our cousin who shared our good taste.

When we got inside I paid less than $25 for three people to eat at the all you can eat buffet.  And that includes drinks.  I felt smug.  Only at Pancho's could this public interest lawyer treat two people to a sitdown meal without having to mentally recalculate how much her net worth had gone down as a result of the expenditure.

Our eyes were bugging out at all the choices.  Four different kinds of enchiladas, refried beans, rice, burritos, chips and salsa, fajitas, ice cream, sopapillas, among many other food items.    

Pancho's combines the gluttony and endless choices of the all you can buffet with the hospitality of a sit down restaurant.  You fill up your plate at the buffet and sit down to eat.  If you need seconds (or in my case, thirds) you raise a miniature Mexican flag at your table, signalling to the server that you need something.  You then tell the server what you want from the buffet and they'll bring it back for you. I'm suspicious of this setup; Pancho's website makes it sounds like the server is there to enhance patrons' experience but I feel like this is a tactic to curtail the amount of food that people eat.  In the time it took the server to bring me a second plate of enchiladas, I could have already been working on a third of taquitos, had I been able to make a return trip to the buffet on my own. The same thing goes for the fact that you don't help yourself to the food at the buffet but are served by Pancho's employees who stand behind the counter.  But I digress; don't want to give the impression that poor Jeanne didn't get enough to eat.  We enjoyed our lunch at Pancho's so much that the next night, we casually suggested Pancho's once again for a family dinner, hoping the rest of our family had forgotten that Pancho's had been vehemently vetoed a day earlie. Unfortunately our family members weren't dumb enough for that. 

When I got back to New York I immediately when to Pancho's website, eager to see if there was a Pancho's nearby.  Too bad for me and Little Brother; Pancho's restaurants are located only in Arizona, New Mexico, Arizona and Louisiana.  On days when I feel overwhelmed at work and disillusioned with the criminal justice system,  I dream about a second career as the proud owner of a Pancho's restaurant.  If I can't bring justice to my clients, maybe I can bring Pancho's to the Northeast."}
{"text":"OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway? Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos."}

So yes i got full here but dont think i will be craving this place anytime soon and begging to go back."}

I didn't even get another plate after my first; however, I found myself just eating all the sweet stuff. =T Sugar makes things better, right? LoL!
I do like one thing from this place (but it's not enough to make me want to come back here again) and that's their sopaipillas; however, I feel like it used to be better before because they actually put stuff on it, but when I came here, they served it plain. I had to drench it with chocolate syrup. 
I was really surprised that it cost about $20 for two people with drinks included...I know I can spend my $20 else where and be satisfied completely. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Aye, Pancho's!   
When you're good, you're very, very good, but when you're bad, you're horrid!

Okay, so here's the secret to a potentially enjoyable, or at least tolerable, dining experience in a cheap ass dive of a restaurant:
Go knowing it'll suck.  Go because it is a consistent suck, and the suck you know is better than the suck you don't.
You may end up pleasantly surprised.  Happens to me all the time.

(If you don't expect it to taste like a PIZZA at all, a Totino's frozen cracker with sauce and toppings can actaully be a little tasty.)

Pancho's has all that I love in a cheapo boofay.  There's a lot of variety to choose from, and of course, as much as you can stuff in your gullet.  They even have the added benefit of a server to bring you your seconds and beyond.  I just wish the food was more consistent.
If you go on a day that the cooks know what they're doing with the fryer, it makes all the difference in the world.  There are a lot of items that are cooked that way - chicken taquitos, turkey flautas, tortilla chips, sopaipillas, etc - that are so good when they achieve the proper consistency on the delicate \"Crispy~Greasy Spectrum\", but so nasty when they are not.
The salsas are actually pretty good.  They have a few from which to choose, from mild and tomatoey to a chunky&HOT roasted number.  They used to have one of the better tomatillo salsa verdes I've had, but I don't think they make it anymore.

Your best bet seems to be to avoid the busiest times with the most children.  Lunch or late weeknights should be okay.  Unless you're bringing a group of kids, who should LOVE IT here.

On bad days, it's easily a 1, but on good days it can be a 3.5, so I'm going with a rating of 3, as long as you go knowing what to expect.

To a realist, the glass is always full - half with water, half with air.  
I eat at crappy places and enjoy it.

{"text":"I have been going to Panchos for about 7 years and it is about as good as I can expect from a Mexican buffet. I like their chicken enchiladas with the green sauce, the green corn tamales, and the beef taquitos. There are plenty of not so great food there too.... but, again, it's a buffet, so if you get something you don't like, get something else. The place is cheap and the food is fine. Be sure to raise the flag and get some sopapillas... the best part of the meal, with a little honey inside. The place is cheap and, although not authentic, it's decent food.  I will continue going here and people should not be scared to give this place a try because they have never heard of a Mexican buffet."}
{"text":"I am literally distraught that this place is closed. Oh how I looked forward to my Pancho's run when I go back to AZ but obviously this isn't going to happen. I have to admit after the manager from Fort Worth left the quality went way down. Pancho's is a childhood staple as I grew up in Fort Worth and my grandpa used to take us every Saturday morning at 11 am. (And you BETTER not be late!) Goodbye my tex-mex in AZ for now I will have to wait until I make it back to Texas to eat you again. This is the one I frequented while in Fort Worth:

{"text":"Oh Pancho's, how I miss you.

Authentic or high-quality Mexican food, this certainly is not. I've taken others who have vowed to never return. This place is not for the weak of stomach. If you are brave enough to try Pancho's Mexican Buffet and can appreciate it for what it is, you will love it as much as I do.

It might not appear to be a typical all-you-can-eat buffet, but just remember these three words: RAISE THE FLAG. Yeah, it's the ultimate American dream: an-all-you-can-eat buffet that doesn't even require getting off of your ass for seconds! Want more taquitos? RAISE THE FLAG! Tortillas, or chips, perhaps? RAISE THE FLAG.

You have to appreciate the absurdity of it all. And to top it off, the food's kinda delicious too, in a you-know-this-is-so-bad-but-it's-so-good sort of way."}
{"text":"Pancho's is great if you like eating dog shit.  This was honestly some of the worst food I have ever eaten, or attempted to eat. All, I MEAN ALL, of the food is frozen and tasteless. The enchiladas were smothered in a sour tasting sauce that undoubtably came from a can. The taquitos were inedible, you would find better ones at the gas station. The tamales were unexplainably bad. To add to the wonderful dining experience at Pancho's, the clientele is fat, morbidly obese, diabetics who shovel mountains of this god awful food from their plate to their mouths. You couldn't pay me to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great value- truly all you can eat and pretty good food. Great family environment and great service from the buffet line to our waitress. Too bad the area is not thriving because it wasn't as crowded as you'd expect for a friday lunch."}
