{"text":"I noticed a lot of \"Emerald Island Grill\" reviews were  just lumped into the Emerald Island Casino business, so I decided to separate it out since the restaurant is different from the actual gaming area.

This restaurant is pretty good. Their regular menu is the standard fare but they have a lot of rotating specials, so be sure to check the board before you sit down. They have rotating theme nights each night and have a lot of special food events too (Mother's Day, Easter brunch, etc.) Sometimes there is a wait, so be prepared, although they are pretty good at letting you know how long it is. They're open 24 hours too, which is nice, although not all the food is served at that time, so check the menu so you know what you can order. Breakfast starts at 11PM and goes until 3 PM which is a nice touch for you super night owls or really late risers.

If you come to the casino at all, they frequently send out \"meal vouchers\" for free specific meals. Some of the meals are more exciting than others, but you can't argue with free. So it's worth playing a little bit here to get some comps. However, the meal prices aren't outrageous on their own. Plus, on Thursdays if you earned 100 points the week before, you get half of any entree. 

If you want value, you should check out their full rack of ribs. My husband and I split that one time AND we still have leftovers for the two of us for another day."}
{"text":"The intensity of the cigarette smoke in this establishment completely ruined my experience. I guess if you're a smoker or aren't at all sensitive to cigarette smoke you'll be okay. I don't smoke so this place made my eyes water when I came through the door. I was with others who commented it was strong. Won't go back."}
{"text":"If you like frozen food or less than frozen food quality, go for it. Also, if you want to wait 20 minutes or more just for a beer and be asked to pay separately by the cocktail waitress go for it. To sum it up, I wouldn't recommend this food to anyone. Thanks but no thanks."}
