{"text":"We ordered delivery and was greatly disappointed! Chicken fingers were horrible and my Philly steak was soggy and nasty.  When I called back to complain staff was very rude and said no one ever complains and that is what a Philly is.  She was a major bitch and has no idea what customer service is.  I hope they are out of business soon!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and have only found a few places that come close. Just bought my house by this place so one Saturday morning we decided to try it! Waste of $! we spent $34 for lunch, my wings where under cooked and slimy and had feathers in them! Mozzarella sticks where not even cooked all the way! Will not go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered food one hour and ten minutes ago, no delivery  when I called to find out why I was told where busy your food is here .no delivery driver .me my food sitting there one hour and a half yes we're busy .o.k then got major attitude. Gonna dispute my charge card in the morning, Sophias sucks!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only writing a review at this time because it's the second time they get my order wrong.  I actually called initially to just let them know that they weren't getting things right to see if maybe they can improve themselves I spoke to the manager Mario who from the beginning would not let me get a word edge wise  I was polite and every time I said something he would talk over me. He  had no idea about any type of customer service if he knew any better he would realize that people just really want to be heard. I tried to explain to him that he needed to at least let me explain to him what the situation was I wasn't trying to get anything for free I just wanted him to give us better customer service I don't ever want to order from this place again there's plenty of pizza places in this town and service is huge for me."}
{"text":"$20.00 for a cheese and mush/pepp pizza!!  Pizza was actually $13.99 (w top and deliv charge)....pizza was super greasy and crust was chewy - not at all worth the price!  Very rarely do we have pizza delivered, I think we are better off just ordering from pizza hut. First and last time or us!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious and the service is excellent! My order is always correct and the employees make you feel like a part of the family... My favorites are the Philly cheese steak and the hot chicken fingers, so yummy  Last but not least, I always order extra ranch because they have the BEST ranch sauce ever lol..."}
