{"text":"So i ordered a take out and ordered a large rice bowl with chicken and scram egg. I think its called oyoko don. So i got home and getting ready to eat And when i opened the styro, theres not much chicken in there, i can actually count how many chicken meat that was there. If i only knew that i would spend $7 for just large rice and basically with only scram egg in there then I could have just made myself that at home!"}
{"text":"OMG the spicy miso Ramen soup gave me life! Was mad I only bought one to go! Highly recommend this place. Everyone was so nice!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious spicy tonkotsu ramen that hit the spot. The egg in the ramen was one of the best I've ever had. Also ordered the yaki gyoza which was perfectly seasoned.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Wow, really amazing ramen! Brings me back to my days in the Navy, stationed in Japan. I have been looking for a good ramen for quite awhile, and can honestly say I am very pleased with the offerings here. I had the Spicy Miso Ramen...delicious and not so spicy it couldn't be eaten. Perfectly cooked eggs, and the pork belly extra was so perfect! Sweet, porky, tender, an excellent addition to an already great bowl of soup. A long drive from the west valley, but worth every mile."}
{"text":"Better than other Ramen around Tempe. Soup and takoyaki are awesome. Don't try the SPICY SPICY ramen...it's really SPICY. Small place(regular japanese style), and not good for a large group of people."}
{"text":"Good, price, ambience, service. Everything. Perfect. First time here and I'll definitely be coming back. I got my he spicy miso ramen,hiraka bun and seaweed salad. 'Twas all dope!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Soup base wasn't great.  Ramen was OK.  I didn't have much expectations."}
{"text":"Awe man this was bookmarked for a while now and I finally got to go today. Hmmmmmm I really wanted to love it but but I didn't. Don't get me wrong the service, and the quaint interior of the place is good.  I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth for the price I payed and left still hungry. I had buyers remorse.....Thats never good when u leave a place still hungry."}
{"text":"This place is very small, so be prepared. I am a very picky ramen eater, but decided to give this place a try. They do make fresh noodles daily, and everything is made to order. I tried the spicy miso ramen, and my friend ordered the spicy spicy miso. I felt the broth in both dishes lacked full flavor and were bland. To me that makes or breaks a dish regardless of how many toppings I can add.."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! The broth is tasty, noodles are homemade, and portion is good sized.  I had the ultra spicy ramen and my husband had the spicy ramen- ultra spicy had a nice kick to it!  So happy another ramen shop opened up.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and accommodating. Location is a bit small and cramped, so bringing a large party may be difficult. Should call before to check how busy it is beforehand. Other than that, great service and great food. Ordered the tonkotsu ramen and really enjoyed it. Would come again and would recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered the curry ramen and I ordered the tonkatsu. Oh!! I almost forgot we also ordered the takoyaki! The noodles were fresh and not soggy at all. You can definitely tell they make their own noodles and not store-bought. Their takoyaki was also great. The chefs were very generous  with their tako (octopus) and the bonito flakes (fish flakes).  Each ball is huge and totally worth the money. Lol 

Service was awesome and we had a great time there. 

Prices were reasonable as well. 

Definitely going back there again."}
{"text":"They are great! Order your ramen \"rich,\" because it is way more flavorful. It does get a little crowded when busy, but the food and owners are awesome."}
{"text":"Of all the ramen houses in Phoenix and outlying area, its just ok. The noodles were chewy and tasty, which is made in house, but I understand that their stock is Tonkatsu, and its just not enough flavor. I excepted a more savory and thicker flavor, but unfortunately the broth was flat and boring."}
{"text":"I have a lot to say about this place because it was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had in my life, but I will keep it relatively short for the reader's sake.

Horrible service [0/5]: Our \"waitress\" came by once, and then never again. We had to stop another employee and he became our server. The party seated after us was served their entire meal before we had to wave down our waitress and tell her we wanted water.

Bland Food [0/5]: I was hyped up about the noodles, but they just weren't very good. We requested soft boiled eggs but all received hard boiled eggs. The pork was chewy and the gyoza wasn't properly cooked. 

Wooden Spoons [5/5]: Those spoons were awesome. It's the only reason I am content giving them a single star."}
{"text":"So here's the skinny on Tampopo: the noodles are great. Hard to beat noodles made on premise, they're very proud of that, as the first sight you see besides the crowd is the room to the right where the ramen is made. It's a thin ramen, holds against the teeth very nicely, not too soft, not too firm. The spicy miso broth was good enough to finish the bowl, enough veggies to provide a nice texture and flavor landscape against the roasted notes of the chashu and in my case, the cubes of buta kakuni -- pork belly slow braised in shoyu and dashi -- that I got extra. There are a lot of options to add to ramen. There was even an option to kaedama, add a second helping of noodles -- but we were pretty full. The praise we've lavished on the noodles isn't shared with the starters which showed up after the noodles did: the takoyaki, sadly, were fresh out of fridge cold, and the tebasaki, while ginormous, were essentially fried naked wings, splashed sparingly with sweet shoyu and a few black sesame seeds. These were both fails. But we'll be back for the noodles."}
{"text":"Food was really good but service was absolutely a wreck! They even still charged us for things they said they were out of that we never received. Took them 10 minutes to come greet us for water... We ordered a 16oz beer they gave us a 12 oz that was poured half foam and still charged us for the 16oz. They forgot to put in half our order we had to ask several times where the appetizers were and neither of the servers recalled even us having ordered any even though she wrote down our order. I ordered a spicy miso and got a regular miso. What is worse is they delivered our order to the wrong table then proceeded to give us the cold order that was sitting with some other couple. That is not sanitary! We had to ask for ones that weren't sitting on someone else's table how do I know the other table didn't play with that food? The girl said she couldn't split the check in half because the system won't do that but being in the restaurant biz I know for a fact that square has that capability. They also used Lysol spray to clean the tables which I don't think is up to code since the fumes were very potent and that was not pleasant to have blow my way while I was eating. Basically the experience was extremely frustrating and crazy unpleasant it's a shame because the food was good. The money was no where near worth it. 50 bucks can get u a better experience somewhere else. Only reason not 1 star is because food was good."}
{"text":"This place is dynamite! I am obsessed with ramen and have been looking all over for a good place. This is the best I've found. The Tonkatsu was just delicious I had to take it home with me to finish it! I also got the pot stickers and the cucumber as appetizers and they were amazing too. Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"By Far one of the best authentic Japanese ramen in Arizona I've had so far.   There noodles are freshly made and the pot roast is hands down so good.  Also their braised pork belly is really good.  Enjoyed every bit of it."}
{"text":"i ordered miso and my hubbgot hot miso.it was so delicious.shop was little tiny but i don't mind just high chair is not what i expected.... especially we have 2 years old. 
anyway, ramen soap is so so good and we love chasyu.i'm from japan and i know real ramen taste. This place noodle is good and serviced very quick and friendly.will go back there soon."}
{"text":"the pork belly tasted burnt. I wish it was cooked better :| cool waitresses and chefs. I like seeing how the chefs prepare each meal behind the glass. The Tonkatsu ramen is yummy and I wish there were larger bowl sizes :p"}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant tucked in a strip mall. INside is bright and has comfortable seating. Food is great. Had the Tonkatsu Ramen. IT's a generous portion and if you are still hungry, you can refill with another round of noodles for just $2 . Had the pork bun as an appetizer which was delicious too. Will be a regular here for the monthly ramen fix."}
{"text":"Big on attitude and short on delivery...the menu is replete with up-charges. We started with the pork belly, gyoza, and the takoyaki none of which were above average. The ultra spicy ramen wasn't terribly spicy and the broth, while dense, lacked flavor and the noodles were undercooked. There are plenty of other ramen shops nearby featuring better offerings."}
{"text":"Very good spicy ramen. Also had the fried chicken. It was good too.  I guess I've been spoiled with ramen from West L.A. on Sawtelle. More specifically, Tatsu Ramen.  It seems that if you have it good in one place you always expect it to be just the same at other places. At Tatsu the sweet corn actually tasted sweet whose flavor really \"popped\" AND you got lots of it.  This was not the case at Tampopo.  At Tampopo, you can see right in front of you the sweet corn being cooked and it looks fresh. However, it didn't have a fresh crispy bite to it nor was it memorably sweet.  The saving grace was the ramen's thick zesty broth and perfectly cooked noodles, two delicious pork slices, and a near-perfectly boiled egg. Bravo.   What was missing was fresh pressed garlic as a topping.  Again, I'm comparing it to Tatsu Ramen where I was able to press the garlic myself and in an amount of my choosing."}
{"text":"I was the morning and weekend shift waitress there. Unfortunately I left to explore other oppurtunites. But let me say this ... Not trying to be bias either. The FOOD IS AMAZING!!!. My favorite go-to dish was the chaysu don which is chopped pork over rice . LIFE!!!! I've been debating on since I'm off tomorrow if I wanna go get me some Tonkotsu Ramen or Some Kakuni don . I don't care about the prices because it's worth every penny. I've never been so close to Japan in my life and despite the 2 debbie downers i seen on the reviews , dont be fooled ! they are worth trying .!!!"}
{"text":"The portion is huge for ladies! Chicken wings are good, I like the source. We ordered two kinds of Ramen. The miso one is richer than the pork soup one. The slices of pork are roasted for a minute or so, and they taste really good. However, I am a bit disappointed by the ramen noodles themselves. They taste a bit dry and hard."}
{"text":"Ramen Porn for sure.. Those of you who love Ramen - this is the place to go. The Ramen Chef is incredible. for a mere $2 more you can order extra noodles and take home.. Amazingly delish. All of their sides are also delish. Service staff is my only down slope. The guy servers are always friendly, fast and accurate. the girl servers are not so much so.. If you get a chance - sit by the chef and have a great convo with him."}
{"text":"The place is rather small with not many tables so expect yourself sitting at the bar or their long table among other people.

The price is decent, and I really liked the food I ordered which was the Miso ramen and some Takoyaki on the side. I even got extra noodles with how much I looked the broth.

I don't know if it was just really busy today, but it took an absurd amount of time to get my check. Waited nearly 25 minutes to receive the check.

The food is great, and I'd recommend asking for your check a bit ahead of time with how long it may take to receive it."}
{"text":"This is the best Ramen restaurant in the state of Arizona. I tried the miso while my partner had the tonkatsu. Both were incredible. They make noodles fresh everyday, and once you try them you will settle for nothing else. Tampopo sets the standards high. All of the employees were friendly and hospitable, the ramen was extremely affordable for the quality of food you will receive. To put it another way, you pay ten dollars for some of the best food you will eat in Phoenix. You need to go here. The noodles have changed my life for better. I have ascended to a higher plane, and look down from the clouds with sympathy at those who have not eaten those noodles. I, too, was once a mere mortal unaware of the mighty powers of fresh noodles from Tampopo."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch and it was great! You can get any bowl of ramen and sub the broth with soy milk. I tried the spicy ramen bowl with soy milk broth and it was surprisingly  good! It was thick and creamy and I definitely get it again. My friend got the original bowl and like hers as well. Great little place."}
{"text":"Food is good though used to be better. I believe it has gone down a bit since they switched the pork cut they used and started hiring new cooks. Eggs/Meat need to be more up to temp when served."}
{"text":"This place makes Republic Ramen look bad!   Got the miso ramen, Japanese chicken wings and octopus balls.  Ramen tasted fresh and not like a can of soup full of sodium!  Wings were good but nothing too special other than they're pretty good size.  The octopus balls is like potato balls with a piece of octopus...not too bad.   Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"this place was great. I had the hirata bao and spicy ramen. the bao was taste better if it was warm or fresh but when I got it, it was cold and the bottom part of the bun was wet. probably from steam it which didn't make since why it would be cold. the ramen was pretty good. way more flavorful than ramen republic. the ramen is given with a large wooden spoon. I found it easier to eat with the spoon of you bring it vertically up to your mouth instead of tilting the spoon. also, the service was good and bad. one of the waiter service was good while the other one not so much. as I was eating he just walked by and toss my check on the table, which was rude to me. he didn't seem like he was having a bad day since I can hear him carrying a conversation and joking with the table behind me."}
{"text":"Small and very traditional ramen place. I love the idea of the fresh made ramen which sets the bar high for any other ramen spot... hirata buns, are fantastic... I'm not sure if their steamed buns are made in house but still very tasty...  the spicy miso ramen and curry bowl were alson great.... loved the food definitely we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Our family is a big fan of ramen, so we went to this restaurant right away when we heard about it. We ordered miso ramen, spicy miso ramen and ultra spicy ramen. They were tasty and flavorful. A bowl of ramen came generously with 2 pcs of Chashu & 1 whole boiled egg. It was also garnished with scallion, gobo root (good stuff). More importantly, the ramen is freshly made daily.

A couple of feedback to make it even better. First, I think the soup here is a bit watery. The additional $1 of rich soup didn't help. I hope they can take this oppty to improve the soup base. When it comes to ramen, soup is the most important ingredient. Second, I think the chashu meat was a little tough. It would be even better if they can make it softer.

On the other hand, I would rate it one of the top ramen restaurants in AZ. If the owner can improve on the 2 items above, I believe they will be comparable to Santouka, Tajima or Yamadaya in CA."}
{"text":"Pretty cool. Just like Japanese ramen restaurant- pretty cool. Food is excellent. Asahi draft beer w nice Japanese chicken and octopus balls for appetizer and incredible noodles  nice happy atmosphere and truly amazing experience. We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Save ur dollars for gas money to Vegas or LA or fly to Fukuoka. We know ramen and this broth had little semblance to authentic tonkotsu even with the supposed infusion of the $1 ??????base, real tonkotsu ramenyas would never even have such a concept, gasp! Doubt there was even enough pork bones in Tempe to get it up to par from the flavorless watery base. 

In house noodles were the switch and bait and seeing the cook take out frozen bags of gyoza u buy at Costco or the neighborhood Chinese supermarket was also a deal breaker. Are the owners Korean I couldn't confirm but likely as their Japanese inspired t-shirts had nonsensical and incorrect printed verbiage. Net net subpar service and waiting for ten min for a menu when it wasn't even remotely busy ain't getting u far in repeat business unfortunately. Was really disappointed...that I wasted $34 of calories. Fortunately we have a direct supply of supreme ramen from a Rakuten Int'l online retailer that keeps our cravings satisfied."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Cute little ramen shop, always busy with great upbeat atmosphere and awesome food. I almost always get either the spicy miso or the ultra spicy ramen. Service has always been great, food is consistently amazing. The only thing is that the shop is a little limited in space, so prepare to cozy up to your dining neighbor. Will be dining again very soon!"}
{"text":"Second favorite ramen place (diehard Umami fan). They have really awesome broth, meat, and ramen noodles. Ask them to add butter to your broth. I swear, it'll be best thing you ever do. They'll look at you weird, but it is so worth it. I usually get the Tonkotsu, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The portion sizes are pretty large too. I always end up taking half to go."}
{"text":"I've seen posts from friends on FB about Tampopo.  So I dined here not once, but twice in a week.  The restaurant is small.  But even though this place lacks space, they know how to prepare yummy ramen!  Most Ramen-ya in Japan is crowded without chairs because people are on the go.  Tampopo tries to keep the traditional ramen-ya without the Western frills.  So don't even think about hanging out with friends to talk and catch up at the dinner table, please go elsewhere.  

My first bowl was the tonkatsu ramen.  The broth was rich with a lot of depth.  The noodles was just the right texture and chew.  Customers are able to see that the noodles are fresh as you walk in.  To complement my meal we had takoyaki and wasabi tako.  They were both really, really delicious.  

My next bowl was the ultra spicy ramen.  The hot factor was just as good as my love for Korean spicy food.  It was a cold evening, so my ramen was the perfect cure.  This place won over my husband's appetite.  He got extra pork and egg for his ramen.  The kids for once didn't complain and they enjoyed the takoyaki with the generous amount of bonito flakes."}
{"text":"First off I will say it was OK.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I have spent a considerable amount of time in Fukuoka and love Hakata Ramen. So when I heard about Tampopo I was very excited and had no problem driving across town to give it a try.  I actually had the opportunity to try three different types Tonkotsu, spicy miso and their ultra spicy.  The soup is relatively weak.  Hakata ramen is Pork based rich with flavor, but theirs needed more flavor.  There is an option to order the \"rich\" soup, so don't expect it to be flavorful with the basic (I didn't try the rich).  Additionally I was expecting benishoga (pickled ginger) and takana (pickled mustard greens). An other topping that needed help was the char siu (roast pork).  the pork was cut too thick and was extremely fatty.  The little bit of meat was tasty though.  I was not a fan of their ultra spicy ramen.  The spice level was right, but they mixed spices with the noodles making them pink.  I think it would be better with standard noodle in the spicy soup.  The spicy soup made up for the lack of flavor.

Service was lacking, but understandable since it is a new restaurant.  Because of this my rating just refers to the food.  When we arrived we were greeted by three different people and asked if we were ready in the first 5 min.  That was the highlight of the service.  The waitress brought the wrong order.  I don't believe in wasting food so I told her it was alright and started eating.  Fifteen minutes later another lady brought the correct order.  When we finally finished our meal it was 20 minutes before we got the check.  

I will probably wait a while before giving Tampopo another try."}
{"text":"Great local ramen place. Authentic Japanese ramen. Also they have soy milk broth for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Love this place. Never disappointed. Love the Miso soup w Kakuni. The Kakuni tastes good w any soup! So far, the best ramen place I've experienced in Phoenix. The staff are super pleasant and quick!"}
{"text":"Miso Ramen on point. Can't wait to go back. Service was equally as good. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a treat to have in Tempe! My friend and I used to love going to another ramen restaurant in the area (I'm sure you can guess which one), but it quickly lost its appeal since it objectively was pretty meh. When my friend came back in town to visit, I had to take him here. We were both so pleasantly surprised with everything- fresh, perfectly cooked noodles; rich broth; delicious marinated egg... And the melt in your mouth pork belly. Only qualm was the pork buns I decided to try- too much sauce (as others have noted). The portions are quite generous, especially the edamame appetizer. So basically, give this place a shot! Perhaps it's not the best ramen place out there, but it's the best I've had so far!"}
{"text":"Amazing and traditional Japanese ramen. They greet you with traditional Japanese greeting and the layout of the place reminded me of Japan. The menu was no surprise, traditional ramen and sides.  Simply amazing place and happy Phoenix added this place. It will be a weekly stop for sure!  Some places fail to make the perfect ramen, not here. It's a must try if you never had ramen before."}
{"text":"The food here was simply delicious. My boyfriend and I haven't been too impressed with the other ramen places in Arizona so we thought we'd give this place a try. I'm so glad we did because it was truly an awesome experience. We got the spicy miso ramen and the ultra spicy miso ramen. I highly recommend adding rich soup which added so much flavor to the ramen. We also got takoyaki and strawberry mochi ice cream (how can you not?) and it was perfect. Service was quick and the staff there was friendly. Please try this place!"}
{"text":"Never been to a ramen shop so I try this place and fell in love .  Hand down the best in Phoenix"}
{"text":"No exaggeration: The absolute best ramen I have ever had in my life, better  than in Los Angeles, better than in Japan itself. I have become a regular here."}
{"text":"The only authentic ramen in the greater Phoenix area as far as I am aware. Definitely worth your support...whether you are a ramen junkie or a curious newbie. 

The spicy miso ramen and kara-age (fried) chicken are both delicious. They use to make there own Okonomiyaki in-house but have now reverted to store-bought. Still good though."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I'm very impressed. The ramen was savory and the octopus cake balls where the best they just melt in your mouth. Me and my girlfriend have come here twice this month and won't be slowing down anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just moved into the Tempe area and started trying local ramen places. This one is the one I return to over and over, and have introduced several friends and family to. The Spicy Miso ramen is wonderful, the broth is delicious. The pork belly with rice was heavenly the first time i ordered it - the pork melted in my mouth. The second time i ordered the pork belly, it was just a little more firm, not as melty - but still fantastically delicious. It comes in a tiny bowl with rice and crab salad but is more than filling. I will keep going back and taking new friends to enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Ever since my trip Japan, I've been looking for ramen shop. This place definitely fits the bill. It matches a similar experience I had in Akihabara. I've been here 3 times now and this place consistently delivers. Though everyone's tastes differ, I highly recommend the miso soup."}
{"text":"Came here excited to try it... Don't really get the hype everyone is talking about? As we were checking out the kitchen we both noticed the Pork Roll they use in most of the Ramen was sitting out in the open on top of the stove in a pan not even covered...  and they would just take it down to slice pieces off of it. No wonder my friend and I got sick the next morning. The Ramen ( base or broth) in a nutshell for us was bland and the noodles didn't have any real flavor, they weren't even cooked properly. Really disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the karrage and miso ramen. Reminded me of restaurants visited during our trip to Tokyo. It's a small restaurant with a communal long table in the middle. Good service."}
{"text":"I went here late night with my girlfriend for our daily dinner. 
The ramen was amazing,  I forgot what we got but,  the  we got the premium broth with ours,  which was worth it. 
There was so much noodles that we finished about 80% of it.  
Overall,  it is a good place to go for a new thing."}
{"text":"We've eaten ramen all over the valley, and so far this is as good as it gets.  The tonkatsu ramen was fantastic!  The pork was thick, smoky, and delicious - just like the broth.  The noodles were chewy and good - clearly not made from dried.  We also had the red paste bun for desert - which looked more like a pancake sandwich.  Served cold and not overly sweet.  We'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!

One note - for Japanese soup in general - the ton ton and beef noodle soup at Dozo Izakaya is also fantastic :-)"}
{"text":"The noodles were a little bland, all I could really taste was the spice. But, however, the service was spectacular. All the waiters and waitresses were respectful overall you should definitely try the eggs"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS.  They delivered our appetizers WITH our entrées.  My spouse decided to keep both, and I sent mine back because I expected the food properly paced.  I surely did not want all that food all at once.  When I was finished with my appetizer, my spouse was finished with his entrée, so I passed on my entrée as the timing was now ruined.  However, they demanded payment for my entrée.  I refused on the basic restaurant management principle that the customer does not pay in the face of the restaurant's inability to properly pace appetizers and entrées.  BE WARNED OF THEIR FLAGRANT WILLINGNESS TO DISREGARD BASIC FOODSERVICE CUSTOMER SERVICE PRINCIPLES."}
{"text":"Best ramen shop in Phx for sure. Broth is made from scratch, not powder. Noodles are fresh and perfect texture. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"We loved it! I'd go there again in a heartbeat! My son eats here all the time and I finally got to try it out, the octopus appetizer was excellent, and the homemade noodle have the right texture! Great atmosphere and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yum Yum ! I find myself craving the delicious flavors and fresh noodles. Miso Ramen was todays pick, and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Overcooked egg, flavorless pork, broth was underwhelming, service can be best described as \"passive aggressive\". At least the mediocre ramen was warm?

If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and go across the street to Dozo. The difference is night and day."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Tampopo. I'm fairly new to ramen (didn't know what I was missing out on) but so far this place is my favorite spot to get ramen.

The broth is good (I've tried a couple different ones) and both the pork and pork belly are worth getting extra. The chicken is good as both an appetizer and an add on.

It's a very small space but the waiters have always been incredible attentive and friendly when we're there. It can be fun to sit by the kitchen and watch them work.

I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian bowl and thought it was very good. My s/o and I both enjoy coming here and love their food. We will be returning."}
{"text":"We were so upset when we heard Umami was closed, but still craved delicious ramen. We searched and found this place, reviews were good enough so we decided to check it out. We walked in to an almost empty restaurant but also saw they make the noodles in-house, so we kept walking. We found a table we liked and our server came over right away. She was very sweet and gave great service. Now onto the ramen we both got the spicy pork the pork was burnt and rubbery and the whole meal was simply unappetizing to look at. We both finished just the noodles and left. We recently saw Umami has a new location in Tempe and can't wait to give them our business again. Sorry this place just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get ramen in the Phoenix area, according to an article on AZCentral, so I decided to try it. I'm not sure how I feel about the noodles because I don't have too many other places to compare to. They are made in-house, which is pretty cool, but they are thinner than I'm used to. They're good, just a little different for me. The broth was delicious and so were the egg and the slice of pork that come with the Tonkotsu Ramen. The egg is cooked just as it should be, with a slightly runny yolk. I will likely be back to try a few more varieties of ramen. The service was good and there was no wait at about 5pm on a Thursday. I would recommend Tompopo to friends and family."}
{"text":"The food is just out of this state.  Well perfected authentic Japanese ramen in the house.  Glad we stopped by and tried them out. Asides the amazing food, so was the service and the warm greeting  by the whole staff.  This is another gem in Tempe that everyone should try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I got the Miso Spicy Ramen and added an extra topping of mushrooms. The portions were surprising large but the flavor was mediocre. It's good for you what we have here in Arizona but not the amazing."}
{"text":"Highlight are the super fresh noodles. Tiny little hole in the wall place and was packed to the brim this Monday afternoon. Service was pretty good for being what seemed to be understaffed for the amount of customers they had. We tried the gyoza, spicy and regular miso ramens. Hubs really liked that you could get noodle refills for $1.50! Spicy was not spicy at all  but the server made it seem like the extra hot would ignite my face on fire.... I wish I would have went there! The broth was pretty good and the gyoza was good but the filling was not very hot. So here's where I start to compare to Republic Ramen that is just a couple miles away. RR is hands down better. (Even with the noodle refill option.) I also enjoy that at RR you choose you broth, protein, and fillers to customize your personal bowl. I haven't found a ramen house anywhere else that does it that way.  Overall it was a good experience and we'd do it again if RR was closed or something."}
{"text":"This was the first ramen place I've eaten at in Arizona, and I was told by a friend that this was probably the best ramen he's had in Phoenix but not near California quality. I typically get my ramen fix in New York and California (the most recent was a place in SF) so I went into the restaurant with some hope but realistic expectations. 

My sister and I came here on a weekday around 2pm, and it was empty. This worked in our favor as we got seated and served right away. Though, I've heard from others that they've had to wait a bit even after the typical lunch rush. 

We got the takoyaki to start, and it was better than the ramen in my opinion. I got the classic tonkatsu, and my sister got the ultra spicy ramen. The tonkatsu was alright. It wasn't as flavorful as others I have had, and the egg was hard boiled. That's disappointing because I like soft boiled eggs generally. My sister got the ultra spicy ramen, and she said it wasn't as spicy as the server made it out to be or looked.

Overall, it's alright... I gave it a 3 star ultimately since I wanted to be fair and not compare this place to the ramen of New York and/or California."}
{"text":"Overall, lovely experience here at Tampopo! Prior to arriving (about half an hour), I called to see if I could reserve a table for my party of 6. While they do not take official reservations, they said that they would save an area for all of us to sit; what do you know, our table awaited us upon arrival! I really liked the long, communal table in the center of dining room, which made the restaurant feel more intimate. Yet, the decor was modern and fresh! 

Next, it is a bonus to the dining experience when the restaurant makes their noodles in-house--big selling feature for me! Then came time to order; making a decision was difficult, as all the ramen options sounded pretty delectable! Finally landed on the Miso Ramen and was pleased with my decision; rich flavored broth and tasty accouterments such as the soft boiled egg and seaweed. Still, one friend's ramen were not entirely cooked and lay bunched up in a hard ball within her bowl. 

Further, while our waitress did seem to be swamped with tables to wait on, I did not appreciate that our meals came without napkins. Though this is  not a \"big deal\", and we easily got up and fetched our own napkins, napkins are a basic requirement that should automatically be delivered with our food and silverware. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my experience and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place. I finally had the chance to try it and I gotta say I'm not all that impressed. We came on Sunday afternoon and was seated quickly as it wasn't crowded yet. Our server was great, he was quick to getting drinks and our orders. My first thought while waiting was \"Oh great they serve nice large bowls for the price!\" It was only then after getting our meals my ratings went down for the place. I had ordered the Tonkotsu ramen with additional chasyu (roasted pork) and Tampopo original spicy paste.

First look into the bowl I see it is only half full of broth, next was that even with additional pork there was a total of 3 slices. I was expecting the normal bowl to already include 2-3 slices since the description says there are\" slices of roasted pork\" (plural) therefor I should have at least 4-6 slices total. Also each slice was 70-90% fat, what a waste of $3. The extra $1 for the tampopo original spicy paste is also a joke. Smelling the paste I instantly thought of the spicy korean paste you can buy at the asian markets (1lb tub for about $7). It was given to me on the side in a little 2oz condiment cup with maybe about 1 tea spoon of the paste and charged me a dollar for that.

Overall my experience wasn't too bad the ramen was cooked nicely and the flavor was good but the pricing is what really gets me. I think they need to do some price adjustments if they expect more repeat customers.

Side note heard last night some elderly woman ran her car into the restaurant and will be closed for a few weeks. I hope everyone is not harmed, and have a good christmas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this spot for some ramen. We both get the spicy miso ramen and it's very flavorful. There is a wait during busy hours but we really enjoy it here."}
{"text":"We love this place we have been here plenty of time. Our two hours drive always worth it. Very similar to Monta Ramen in Las Vegas and Daikokuya in downtown Los Angeles. There is something about the broth. I could eat this everyday."}
{"text":"My first time there and I had the spicy miso ramen $9. It was pretty good. The broth was not greasy like the authentic Japanese ramen which I liked but it was little salty for my taste. I ate real Japanese ramen in Japan while I lived there for 1 year so my critique is going to be little tough. But over all it was good enough for me to want to come back~ it's seems busy most of the time so you need to be patient when you go there."}
{"text":"Good service, great atmosphere. Unfortunately I have had better, more flavorful ramen. I did although love their calamari and gyoza sides, they were delicious"}
{"text":"I tried their spicy miso ramen (which wasn't really spicy at all) and thought it was pretty good.  Their inhouse noodles looked so perfect and was on the chewier side (which I liked), and their broth was decent.  A friend ordered hers with the rich broth add-on for an extra few dollars, but while it was slightly more flavorful, it looked like she had less broth than all of ours.  The basic broth is good too, and I don't think the rich broth added too much more to the experience.  Also, their takoyaki balls were mostly dough, so I was quite disappointed in that aspect. 

Also, there's very limited seating here, so you'll most likely find yourself very close and intimate with your restaurant \"neighbors.\" You may have a short wait if you're coming in during their peak hours too. 

Overall this place is one of the better ramen places I've tried in the Phoenix area, and it's definitely a place I'd go back to for my ramen cravings."}
{"text":"My review might be bias because I don't particularly like ramen much but a friend chose this place for her birthday dinner so I had no choice... but I however did have high hopes for this place since a few people I knew gave glowing reviews. I has hoping this was the ramen that would change my minds about all ramen but sadly it did not. 

The only appetizer worth ordering is the takoyaki. That was actually very delicious ... others were very disappointing to say the least.

Appetizer: 
- chicken wing was so meatless and tasteless (nothing like the picture ) 
- pork bao was huge and the meat was non-existent with a ton of sauce and a pathetic piece of iceburg lettuce that was fell outside the bun, rushed much?
- pickles were basically cucumber and carrots with a hint of vinegar

For the ramen itself, it came with a piece of pork that is very tough, not the melt in your mouth kind that makes you want more. I ordered the spicy miso but felt no spice at all. The egg however was perfectly cooked. Also, it would have been nice if they added a little bit more broth,  because I'm a soupy kind of gal, mine felt a bit lackluster. 

I guess I'll still be searching for a ramen that will change it all but definitely not from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the seafood ramen and my husband ordered the spicy ramen. Mine needed a little something extra but it was still a good meal. We also had the Japanese wings which were crispy but not too heavy."}
{"text":"Visted this unique place while in town on business.
Being from SoCal, this place stood out because they make their own noodles in house.
I ordered the \"Ultra Spicy Ramen\" and it didn't dissapoint.
2 things I would have liked better though..
1. Pickled Ginger @ the table
2. Flavored egg... that had flavor? The egg was tasteless / definitely not flavored.. but cooked perfectly.. so.. it's not great, but far from bad.
I feel the fact that the noodles were home-made and the broth was seasoned just right more than make up for the shortcomings of the Ginger and Egg...which are personal preference type things anyways.
A+ ramen joint.. they do it right and it's ohhh so yummy!..Great job guys."}
{"text":"Whoever says this place is bad is an idiot. To the dumbass below this comment who says they have tried ramen in Asia. First congrats, same. Second what do you think you are going to get? We live in the desert half way across the world. This is hands down the best ramen in Arizona. It beats EVERY ramen house in Arizona that I have personally tried. I go out of my way for ramen. If you want the best ramen in AZ come to Tempopo and get the side if pork belly and the octopus ball they are ."}
{"text":"I just returned from Japan and sushi had been totally ruined for me. I was worried that I'd never be able to eat ramen in the US again either, but Tampopo can still hold its own.  Ramen is one of my favorite dishes and I try to try ramen all over Phoenix. So far, the spicy miso ramen here is still in my top three. I would have given them 5 stars 6 months ago, but I think their egg consistency had dropped a tad in recent past. The pork belly buns are also coming out a little stale lately. But I'm nitpicking. This place is a regular for me."}
{"text":"This is a small authentic Ramen shop, it's super  small and the main seating is a long narrow strip of table with a bunch of stools around it. Everyone is sitting next to or across from one another in a pretty small space. Luckily we got one of the few tables, it happened to be empty when we showed up. They have one vegan/vegetarian option and I do not recommend it. The only option they have is ramen noodles in soy milk broth. The soy milk tasted kind of burnt and it was like cereal and warm milk...except it was ramen. This may be more authentic but I did not like the ramen at all. Chalk it off to me having set expectations or not keeping and open mind but soy milk and ramen did not taste good together to me. When I asked if they had any other veg options the server was very frank. No. My friend who ordered non veg ramen thought it was mediocre compared to other ramen spots in Phoenix. Though her reaction wasn't quite as bad as mine, she wasn't all that impressed. My partner disliked the dish so much that he ate a couple bites and left the rest. This is someone who usually leaves no food behind and never has leftovers. This was the first time I saw him straight up not eat his food and he's told me a couple of times, \"that was the worst meal I had in 2017.\" I didn't want to waste food and the noodles themselves tasted pretty good. I pulled the noodles out of the soy milk onto a bowl and added soy sauce to mask whatever burnt tasting soy milk was left and ate the noodles. Not optimum but much better than the original. Will not be coming back here, they do not have veggie broth ramen. if you are vegetarian/vegan your only option here is soy milk broth. My brother who is non veg and loves ramen says this is the best ramen he's had in Arizona so they must be pretty good, I didn't like the vegan option I had and don't recommend for veg people."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good ramen in the valley. This place definitely hits the spot. Make sure you get the rich soup."}
{"text":"No, seriously, HELL NO.

Japanese greeting on entry doesn't make a ramen place (hint to staff: A full throated \"rasshai\" works better. YouTube any izakaya for reference) and the ramen here ... is an utter letdown.

I had the Ultra Spicy Ramen which in the end definitely used Gochujang because it lay on top of the ramen like an oil slick of ketchup.  The sweet undertones most certainly do not belong in ramen.

The broth is weak, the noodles lack bite, and having kaedama means nothing if they are just as weak.  I saw the curry ramen (curry udon is normal, curry ramen is bizarre) turn into a sludge across from me.  There isn't even vinegar on the table for gyoza to go along with the rayu.  The ???? mentaikodon should have been slightly cooked, not entirely raw off the fridge and certainly not mixed in with sesame oil.

It is comical the establishment was named Tampopo (\"dandelion\") but instead of having that on their shirts, it was ? makoto which is the banner for Shinsengumi (wiki that if you care) which also happens to be a far, far better ramen establishment.

As a Yokohama native, two, possibly more thumbs down and a hell no."}
{"text":"Our favorite ramen place!!! It is authentic and delicious. Our son over this place too. One of our favorite spots in Tempe and our favorite ramen."}
{"text":"The food was great, service decent but not many places are good in the service department these days.... so, I like this place and will continue to come back for more!"}
{"text":"We have been on a ramen kick lately and have heard so many good things about this place.  It was good but did not live up to all the hype.  We got the seafood ramen, the broth was okay but the seafood was overcooked as it was tough and rubbery.  Good ramen to me means a rich and flavorful broth and fresh noodles.  Love the noodles though."}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood restaurants. My favorites are the flash fried shishito peppers and the soy milk ramen."}
{"text":"Due to unfortunate incident the location is closed. Make sure you call first before you drive down there."}
{"text":"The ultra spicy ramen with regular noodles, add kakune. Words can not describe how good this ramen is. I'm honestly convinced they put crack in it. The kakune literally melts in your mouth. As someone who has eaten here at least once a week for several months, I feel I can offer some honest criticism. There has never been a bad meal, but there is a definite difference in the broth depending on the day/chef. It ranges from thick/hearty and amazing, to thinner and amazing. I personally like the thicker consistency, but it is always on point taste-wise. On to the egg. Sometimes it is a bit overcooked (no liquid yolk), sometimes it is absolutely perfect. The slice of pork is pretty good, tastes better to me when it gets a bit of extra char when they heat it over the open flame on the stove. The noodles are bomb, especially when they are a little al dente (they are never overcooked in my experience). I always do the regular noodles instead of the spicy out of personal preference. Both are great. On to the broth. I've tried all but the seafood and curry. 

#1 Ultra spicy is NOT that spicy. Don't be afraid of it. It is spicy enough to clear the sinuses and maybe cause a tear or two. No lingering \"burn\" in the mouth. It's by far and away my favorite. 

#2 Spicy Miso. This one needs a bit more spice in my opinion, but whatever. It is rich and ginger-y. Honestly if the ultra spicy and spicy miso had a baby, it might be the best ramen ever

#3 Tonkatsu. This broth is really hearty, but I like spicy, so in my opinion it needs to be dressed up with soy/chile oil/seasoning. Everyone I have taken here that is too chicken to try the ultra has really liked it.

#4 Soymilk miso. It's so-so. Not BAD, but not my personal taste.

As for the appetisers. The hirata buns are pretty good, and the goyoza is good. Honestly if you can manage to eat an appetizer AND a gigantic bowl of ramen, hats off to you. If you came here looking for something other than ramen, move along and save your crappy review and space in this tiny place. Their apps aren't going to blow you away because it is A RAMEN RESTAURANT.

TLDR: Ultra spicy, add kakune! Price is great and you will leave full. Best ramen in Phoenix, hands down!"}
{"text":"Love Tampopo! Their Miso Ramen with add Rich Soup is my favorite. Fresh ingredients are always used. It's very tight in the restaurant but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Let's be honest who doesn't love Ramen? 
Ok maybe some don't and maybe it's not their thing but if you are having ramen in Arizona Tampopo is probably one of the better places you can go to. 

I may not be giving it its full praise only because I have had some really good ramen in the past but again for Arizona this is great. 

The atmosphere of Tampopo is pretty cool. You get the small cozy feeling as it is a small place and tightly packed with patrons. The likely hood is that it's like this in Japan or maybe even smaller so I have an appreciation for that. 

They had a lot of employees and wait staff which is awesome because the food came out quickly and our glasses were kept filled. 

We tried the Japanese chicken and it was delicious. Not dry. Not hard. Not undercooked. Just right. 

The hirata bun was great too. My first time trying it and it didn't disappoint. 

Now on to the ramen. The noodles were soft and just perfect. The broth was flavorful. If you get the extra spicy paste make sure you do not put the whole thing in there. Try a Little first so you can gauge the spiciness level that suits you. At first when the bowl came out, I thought that there wasn't enough broth but after eating it I find that it's the perfect amount. And the best part is they offer more noodles if you like. 

Overall very satisfied and will be back."}
{"text":"Great Ramen joint for Arizona! Good prices too. I recommend  the original tonkotsu broth. Try out the gyoza as well--perfect consistency between steamed and crispy side. It's a small place so we had to wait for a few minutes but it was well worth it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The photos on Yelp were very appealing for Tampopo Ramen, so I was really looking forward to my trip to Tempe to try it. I tried several items: the Soymilk Ramen, the Tonkotsu Ramen, and the Agedashi Tofu. I had a hard time finishing the Soymilk Ramen which is unlike me. The broth was a bit rich, but overall the taste of it was smothered by the green and red peppers. Other parts of the taste were coming from the bean sprouts and scallions. These vegetables weren't cooked into the broth, but topped off with it, and that's pretty much all I tasted. There is an undertone of a milky sweetish taste to the broth that provided the richness. I thought I would enjoy the broth from the Tonkotsu ramen more, but again it tasted like a watered-down vegetable soup rather than a traditional pork-based soup. I liked the decor and design of the restaurant. The service and presentation of the food was excellent, but I left a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic experience at this restaurant.  The staff is very engaging and motivated.  The owner makes the noodles (and takes his job very seriously).  The food is exceptional and delicious and the prices are fair.  We stumbled onto this restaurant by mistake.  I wish for many more mistakes like this in life.  I hope to be back here eating king noodles soon."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!! Must try the rice balls. And the miso ramen is to die for."}
{"text":"My place to go for ramen in the valley. Usually get the tonkotsu ramen with a side of takoyaki. The broth is a bit watered down, but overall it was decent. Sometimes I add in Kakuni (pork belly) in the ramen. This can be a hit or miss - sometimes it's tender, other times the meat is dry. I never have issues with their Takoyaki (octopus) - always good! 

It's a pretty tiny location, but I've never had to wait over 5-10 minutes. You may end up sitting with a stranger, but personally I don't mind it. 

Right next to a Starbucks so parking lot fills up pretty quickly but plenty of parking spots in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles so I'm something of a snob about my ramen. The short of this review is: \"Is it good? Yes.\"

Tampopo has a nice comfy atmosphere for a ramen shop. Small place, pretty crowded but you get nice to sit at a nice bar and watch the chefs scurry away at boiling eggs. Service there is friendly and upbeat, despite being PACKED when I came in the servers were punctual to provide service in a jiffy. I got my drink less than a minute after having been seated. No reason to complain there.

Menu is about as sparse as any other ramen shops tend to be. You get a few appetizers, a few different types of ramen, and some additional toppings. Whatever, it's called a Ramen restaurant for a reason. Ordered a Tonkatsu bowl with a Coke (I guess if I had to complain they don't serve it on tap, so no refills.)

The ramen noodles were just perfect -- not too soft not too firm, and they absorb the flavor of the broth just right to be tasty but not overbearingly greasy. The broth, as well, was exceptional. I tend to find most ramen places put way too much grease/oil in their broth because it gives it more flavor. I'm not a huge fan of it, because it makes you feel like garbage afterwards. Pork cutlet was delicious, albeit not as tender as I'm used to. The toppings are sparse, which is nice if you're a purist and want nothing but that delicious umami flavor. Some black wood fungus, bean sprouts (I usually pay extra for this!), an egg, and scallions. Nothing disagreeable.

I admire that the portions of the bowl was the right size - for $8 you get a bowl that's the right size where you can finish it all and not be hungry nor feel bloated. 

This place gives me a nice feeling, as it feels like one of those nice hole-in-the-wall restaurants that you expect in a big metropolitan city, yet it's only a mile or so from ASU Tempe."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited on a Sunday and was able to get seated fairly quickly even though it was very busy. I ordered the ultra spicy ramen with extra noodles. The broth itself was very tasty, and the noodles were cooked nicely. I would've liked an extra slice of meat as there's already a lot of broth and noodles, but only one slice of meat. If you are coming with a group bigger than 4, be prepared to wait a little as the space is small."}
{"text":"If u want a quick bite this is the place. It can be a little crowded but the food is good and the employees are nice with some funny chefs that make good food."}
{"text":"The BEST ramen in Arizona.

Ramen is one of my favorite foods for over 20 years(and Tonkotsu ramen used to be my favorite ramen), so I have had ramen at many many places, including Hakata Fukuoka where Tonkotsu ramen originally comes from.

While I admit that it might be great if the broth of Tonkotsu ramen here had more flavor, I think that ramens at Tampopo are decent and authentic.

Before I found this place, my \"go-to\" ramen shops in Phoenix/Scottsdale were East Wind and Cherry Blossom. Champon at East Wind and Cherry Blossom is good and I will probably still go there, but Tampopo comes first.

I wish they had more tables for a group of four people."}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars for the tonkotsu ramen. Came here the other night and ordered a steamed bun and the tonkotsu ramen. Steamed bun was overpriced as it was only 1 bun with one thin slice of pork with wayyy too much sauce. Definitely wouldn't order that again. The tonkotsu ramen was just average overall. The ramen noodle itself was really as they're freshly made at the restaurant. However, the broth was only okay, it wasn't as flavorful as I like and lacked a depth of flavor and wasn't porky enough. Also with the ramen, you only get one thin slice of pork, they should at least include 2 pieces. The soy egg was good though as the yolk was still runny and had good soy flavor. You can order additional toppings to the ramen, but I'm kind of a purist so I didn't. Phoenix is limited on ramen places and this would suffice if one had a serious craving. Also wouldn't wait more than 30mins to eat here, wouldn't be worth that long of a wait."}
{"text":"I would skip the Hirata Buns. The steamed buns ($3 each) were dry and hard. Probably the worst steamed buns I've had. Maybe I'm used to Chinese and Vietnamese steamed buns. The yaki gyoja $6.50 filled rice things were interesting but I felt the flavor of the filling was too burnt-like for me. It was like someone scraped the bottom of a pan that was used to roast some meat and seasoned the filling with just the burnt bits.

This is the first time I've tried soymilk ramen and it was like you'd imagine. A soymilk soup. Interesting, but I'd probably stick to the tonkotsu next time. I don't remember if it came with an egg, but I ordered one for $2 extra because I like the egg in ramen more than the pork sometimes.

Both the tonkotsu and spicy mison ramen broths and noodles were tasty. I wish all the bowls were \"rich soup\" instead of having to pay an extra dollar. But maybe that's alright since some people don't care about the boniness/fattiness of their broth and it would be wasted on them.

At the starting price for $8.00 without any add-ons for a bowl of ramen, I feel the price is reasonable and would encourage repeat customers. Cute place and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"just like a shit? we have six people went there eat ramen? four people have the trots??"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised to find this great ramen spot in Tempe while on vacation. The service was great, the staff was friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed the ramen. I also loved the K-pop music playing in the background. This place has great food, good service and a fun atmosphere for all ages. If I travel back to Tempe, this would definitely be on my list of places to go to again."}
{"text":"Hard to find a good Ramen place in the valley.
One of the best ramen places in Phoenix. And yes its not as good as the ones from SF or Japan but still very good compared to the other ramen places in the valley. 
I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic and high-quality tonkotsu ramen. The only disappointment is that side dishes are not as high quality as ramen itself. Still, I'd love to come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This was my first experience of Ramen that didn't come in cellophane ... and I'm hooked.

The staff was patient and friendly explaining all of the options to me. I finally got the \"Ultra Spicy\" with the recommended toppings, and slurped up ever single drop of it. I've had much hotter Mexican foods, but sensitive folks might find it too spicy. 

One serving is way more than enough for me, so the leftovers made a wonderful lunch reheated the next day. (order an extra egg! )"}
{"text":"Though Im fairly new to the ramen scene, Ive tried a few different spots and this is far and away the best ramen Ive ever had."}
{"text":"Very cozy place but not a place if you have little babies. 

Food is good, not great! My cousin got the ultra spicy ramen and it wasn't even spicy for her. Not sure because she can handle her spice or what.

I was satisfied with my miso ramen but very disappointed with the octopus balls. Way too much dough and can hardly taste any octopus."}
{"text":"Seems very authentic. Flavorful tonkatsu broth. Not too salty. Perfect portion. Loved the pork -- high quality. Awesome noodles. Will have to try the spicy ones next time. A bit crowded but very cheerful and quick service."}
{"text":"Love this new Japanese, Ramon place. Well, not sure if it's new but I just discovered it! You HAVE to add Kakuni to whatever you order - so flavorful!! I went there four times and brought a new person with me each time last month!"}
{"text":"This small rare noodle shop makes its own fresh noodles plain and spicy red.  Lots of noodle soup additions and the place is so good that it is generally packed. So many Japanese noodle soup flavors from soy (sio), sweet soy, miso, or white pork tonkatsu. The provided meat is great but adding the thick pork belly (bacon) is even better which is so soft and tender.  The marinated boiled egg is perfectly cooked where the yolk is still soft.  The place also has takoyaki; a common beautifully prepared octopus fritter street food; plus lots of different meat bowls.  All the food is beautifully prepared and tastes as good as it looks served with generous portions for a great price."}
{"text":"Big fan of Tampopo!  I've eaten onsite and for take out. Wife usually gets the miso ramen and I'm a spicy miso kind of guy. I did get ultra spicy this week and it does have a really nice but not overpowering spice level.  I don't have a lot to compare it to but we bought ramen bowls for home so we are committed at this point!"}
{"text":"My brother and I dropped into this joint from out of town and hungry for lunch. The first thing we noticed was their noodles - they hand make them. I was sold.

So, we sat down at the rail and ordered some Tonkotsu Ramen and Takoyaki (a personal favorite of mine). While the Ramen wasn't the best over ever had - it was still damn good. The noodles were on point. 

That said, the Takoyaki was delicious. It's the closest I've found to the real thing in Japan. If you don't like squid, however, these aren't for you.

We did like this place enough to bring my Mom and Sister back for a visit. This time I had a hirata bun, which I thought was good. On this visit the service was a bit lackluster, but we did wait 10-15 mins for a seat and the place was packed, with plenty more customers on a wait, so I don't hold this against them. 

One thing that I rather enjoyed was the atmosphere. It has a feeling of a ramen shop in Japan, even though it is still much larger than many you'd find over there. The service and food was quick, as expected when it comes to ramen. Turns out after my brother and I left my extended family visited twice at different times. It's definitely worth your time and taste buds."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the valley, until I'm proven wrong by another place that's better. Then it'll become just really very good ramen in the valley."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and the food met my expectations. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen with the braised pork belly topping. My girlfriend ordered the Japanese Style Curry. We also ordered two Hirata Buns. The Hirata Buns came out first and we gobbled those up within seconds, they were super tasty and something we will order next time we visit. The \"with mayo\" part in the description of the Hirata Buns was almost enough for me to avoid ordering them but they add to the flavor nicely. My ramen was awesome, loved the roasted pork along with the hard boiled egg. Overall the broth and noodles were packed with flavor and my girl really liked the wooden spoon that came with the bowl. She ordered a small size curry bowl and it was ok, not something I would order when coming to a place known for ramen but it did taste like a decent curry dish and it was the perfect size for her. 

We ordered two different desserts to try. One order of the Dorayaki (rounded sweet red bean) and one order of mango and vanilla Mochi Ice Cream (pounded rice ice cream). The star of the dessert round was for sure the Mochi. One problem I had with the Dorayaki was that they were made and then either frozen or refrigerated because they came to the table ice cold. They are basically a red bean paste sandwiched in between two little pancakes and the cold really brought down the flavor of the bean. If they served that dessert warm it would make a big difference. Another big issue with the desserts were the fact that they were both topped with whip cream and chocolate syrup which did absolutely nothing but mask the flavors. Don't get me wrong I love whip cream on stuff but just because something is considered a dessert doesn't mean it should automatically be covered in whipped cream. Do yourself a favor and request your dessert with no whip cream or the chocolate syrup, I guarantee they will taste better. My girlfriend simply scooped off the whipped cream to the side and we dug into those Mochi balls like there was no tomorrow. For those who don't know they are ice cream balls covered by a thin pounded sticky rice outer layer. One thing that could be an issue for some is the size of the place is fairly small and everyone is seated in pretty tight spaces so if eating close to strangers bothers you then try coming in when they are not busy (if there even is such a time lol). With fall and winter coming up I see us coming here for ramen bowls and mochi whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Tampopo makes their own noodles. Their broths and ramen bowls are generously sized and tastes great. I usually can't even finish a bowl. I've tried all the bowls there and you can't go wrong with the classic Tonkatsu ramen. The two spicy options are good when you want a jolt, though the Ultra Spicy can be so spicy that it covers up any other flavor. The Soy Milk ramen is a tad sweet (who'd thought haha). The Seafood ramen can be fun since the shrimp is whole so you gotta peel it. 

The fried octopus balls are great appetizers. It's a tad crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, with a small morsel of octopus that adds flavor. My boyfriend and I almost always get that when we go.

Another highlight is the braised pork rice bowl. It's a few pieces of fatty braised pork belly on top of white rice, with a side of artificial crab. A filling and quick to-go meal for when I don't want soup noodles. If you haven't tried it yet, please do!

Some things I steer away from: the Curry ramen, since it was bland when I had it. Also I watched the chef dump something from a package and add water to it which was disappointing. The Shisito peppers need work too, they were way too big and just plain flavorless.

I love watching the chefs work, and the entire restaurant team is on top of their stuff too."}
{"text":"Finally a Legit Ramen joint in Arizona! The Ramen is top notch and is Authentic. The prices aren't bad, considering the portions you get. The Takoyaki is great as well. Great Authentic tasting Ramen and appetizers, I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, and the service is fast and friendly. I got the tonkatsu, my daughter got the miso with tofu, my son had Japanese rice balls, and my husband had the curry bowl. The pork buns were our apps, and they were good but slightly dry. The only thing I'd like to see change (I didn't want to rate down), was the loud music in the tiny spot. Man, I could've used some Sinatta or something other than the pop Pandora shuffle they had going on."}
{"text":"Okey the food was good, though its hard to eat there because the place is small and most of the ramen there is pork broth, so its bad news for me, only the seafood and the vegetarian ramens are without pork broth. I would recommend it"}

{"text":"Food: 8/10
Service: 9/10
Value: 7/10

Decent ramen with good favor broth. They got an actual ramen maker out by the entrance, which is kind of cool. Got the spicy miso ramen, gyoza, and takoyaki. Mediocre compared to Tokyo, NYC, SF, LA, or Hawaii. But if you want to get your ramen fix in Phoenix, this is the spot to go."}
{"text":"I go here once a week. I like the food. I like most of everything. In person the service is ok, run by teenagers. Take out is not so good. I take out 80% of the time. I have always had issues with the take out food, it's so disappointing. Also, they are not reasonable on their substitution on their dishes. They charge for everything extra even if you remove a few items. I love Ramen and come here because there are not that many options of good ramen around. BUT I so wish their customer service was better and their take out was on par with the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had pretty much given up hope of finding a decent ramen place in the United States, but Tampopo Ramen appeared to save the day!

The pork belly appetizer tastes amazing. Really fatty and melts in your mouth. Ugh, SOOO GOOD.

The cucumber and sesame oil dish is okay.. I probably should have added more salt or something. It was a little too oily but bland.

The spicy ramen tasted amazing! It would have been nice to be able to customize the softness of the noodles, but hey, we are in not in Japan so whatever.

Note that the tonkatsu ramen uses peanut oil. My sister is allergic to nuts, so it's a good thing that the ingredients are listed!

The service is great!! I had the creamy melon soda thing, which I didn't really love, but it was interesting to try. It was like a fruity cream soda basically.

I would definitely return. It's pretty good and more authentic than most ramen places in the US that I have tried."}
{"text":"This place is a great find in Tempe. The spicy miso ramen is fantastic. Just the right amount of spicy!
Full of flavor, I always drink the remaining broth after I finish the noodles!!! The service is also fantastic!!! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I thought the food quality was decent and authentic. They make their own ramen noodles fresh. The service was great and the portion size was ample.

I ordered regular Tonkotsu ramen and added some vegetables. I also ordered extra noodles. The price was fair for what I received and I was full when I left.

I would recommend this restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The place was packed and that was a good sign. I enjoyed the Tampopo Salad. Love the pork belly and the ramen was delicious."}
{"text":"Ramen is having it's day in the spotlight, and if Tampopo is the result, I'm glad for it!  This place stands out because of the handmade noodles. You can definitely tell the difference!  Their menu has the usual menu varieties and add-ons. I recommend the pork belly. Also for something quite different, try the curry. It's not soup."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place!! Homemade noodles. Ultra spicy for the spicy food lovers is the perfect combo of flavor and chili oil spice! Add gobo...its a weird root vegetable...but yummy! Also delicious canned sake. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not your typical ramen lover. I grew up eating instant ramen and when I realized there were restaurants serving authentic ramen, I decided to give it a try. Out of all the places I've been to, Tampopo Ramen is the best one I've had in AZ! They made me become a ramen lover. The first time I came I got the seafood ramen and absolutely loved it. Today I tried the ultra spicy ramen and it was good as well but I do prefer the seafood ramen more because of its broth. If you are one who can handle your spice, you'll agree with me that the ultra spicy ramen does have a kick to it but it's not \"ultra spicy\". I feel like I got more spice from adding in their spice paste called \"Bakudan\" to my seafood ramen when I first visited. Also, it was hard for me to enjoy the ultra ramen broth because it was more dense, which is something I do not prefer. Nonetheless, the ramen was still tasty and I still think this is one of the best places to get ramen. I love how their ingredients are freshly made and how their seating environment resembles an authentic Japan experience!

PS- Do not wear a white shirt while eating the ultra spicy ramen, especially if you're a messy eater like me!"}
{"text":"We love the curry ramen but all the ramen is good. Very authentic Japanese - even have soda imported from Japan. It is small but service is good and fast so spots open quickly."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This place is great and service is good. You'll find the place a bit on the small side with shared seating areas. Come hungry as the portions are decent size. Great service and yummy ramen. You'll leave here smelling like ramen!"}
{"text":"At first glance it looks intimidating. The furniture is... thrifty, but the overall decor is nice. Really warm indoors though. So if you're looking to escape the sun, this place isn't it. The food isn't pleasent to look at but surprisingly flavorful. And well done. The squid was very surprising being cooked right. Most times I've had squid it's been over cooked and like chewing rubber. They use bandanas as a substitute for Hachimaki, a type of Japanese headband. It doesn't pull it off very well. But it was nice to hear the traditional greeting when I entered. The seating arrangement feels a bit crowded. If you're looking to explore different foods this will definitely satisfy that craving, but I wouldn't bring a date here."}
{"text":"So happy to finally find a good ramen place with freshly made noodles. I had the seafood ramen & the broth was absolutely delicious & flavorful. Noodles were perfect!"}
{"text":"To die for! First time trying ramen and OMG am I glad I chose this places to do so. It was so flavorful! The staff was nice and attentive to all our needs. They took their time explaining any questions on the menu we had. The place is pretty small so I felt trapped in especially since it was pretty busy when we went and it felt like they seated everyone in the same spot and left the front of the restaurant empty. But the most important thing is the ramen! I can't get over how delicious it was!"}
{"text":"Out here visiting from San Diego so I decided to do some restaurant crawling. A buddy recommended this place so we stopped by and had to see what it was all about. It definitely didn't disappoint. The wait wasn't long and the service was excellent. I ordered the tonkatsu with spicy noodles and braised pork belly. The noodles had a small pleasant spice while the pork belly really complimented the meal. My only quarrel is that the broth did not have very much flavor and tasted more like water and oil."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I could eat here everyday. Thanks for the good ultra spicy ramen every time I go. I add extra egg, pork & and find iced chicken. It's great see you guys next week."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple times and I still think it's just whatever. I'll be honest it's not my favorite ramen place. I have given this place a couple of chances and the ramen isn't just as good as other places as I have been to. The broth can be either be too salty or too bland. The baos the serve there are more on the mushy side, which means too much steam. Don't get me wrong is not bad, but after a few attempts and visits, every-time I get more discouraged."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite ramen place, but the last 3 times I went the tonkatsu broth has been pretty bland. That really matters! It's my favorite part of ramen. If broth is important to you try nishikawa ramen they have the best I have had so far.

As for Tampopo, the soy ramen is still pretty good. The presentation is excellent. They have the best soft boiled eggs out of all the ramen shops I have been to and the meat is delicious. The weight staff is friendly, the dinning is super casual and can be kinda \"cozy\" with your fellow diners during busy hours. Also drinks come from a can so heads up no free refills."}
{"text":"A genuine ramen shop has finally arrived! I've been here twice, and both times I've been satisfied! Their broth is so good, and isn't salty unlike other places that serve ramen. If I were to rank the places in Phoenix who have the best ramen, it would be Tampopo, Posh (Tuesday nights), DOZO, and CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. 

I've had the Tonkotsu ramen, and the Soymilk ramen both with the braised pork belly, and it's superb. The noodles are a bit al dente but you know it's the real deal since they're made in house, and you can see the machine they make it with in the small room close to the entrance. The Hirata Buns are good too, as well as the Japanese fried chicken, the grilled squid tentacles, and the gyoza. All good appetizers. I'm looking forward to trying their rice and curry dishes. So, if you have a hankering for a hot bowl of ramen, get your fix at Tampopo! Yum!"}
{"text":"Comparable to republic ramen. The broth is better than amy in Arizona I've had. Smaller slices of meat would be nice but I am not complaining. The real reason I love this place is the ambiance and how hot the broth is, cant beat it!"}
{"text":"Tampopo Ramen has been on my radar for quite some time. I have been wanting to try this place out especially as I was craving ramen the other day. There was a little bit of a wait time for a table which was understandable as I went on a weekend. Their service could be improved however as I felt the wait staff was just running around and they never checked on me until I was done with my meal. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which must have taken at least 20-25 minutes to arrive. While their noodles are very good being hand-spun noodles everything else was average at best. They use a hard boiled egg for their ramen soup whereas other ramen restaurants use a soft boiled egg which I prefer. The pork was extremely chewy, so much so that I couldn't even get myself to finish it. As for the broth it was flavorless and I had to even bring myself to use soy sauce. One positive is that their broth is not very salty which I suppose some people would prefer that instead.

I've had ramen in both LA/SF areas and while it would be unfair for me to compare the ramen here to the ramen shops in California I feel that there could be improvements made to their ramen soup here."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of the best ramen I've had. I'm from Tucson, so I don't get the chance to eat good ramen often. Though whenever I'm in town, I always have to stop at Tampopo. I love getting the Tonkotsu and drenching it in chili oil! Not expensive, pretty good price for a delicious bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Scottsdale. Authentic. Skip the sides and just go for the goods. The spicy noodles are not too spicy and a nice touch. You'll have to ask for some hot water to add to the broth if you want to re-up on the noodles as the broth gets a little starchy with the extra noodle."}
{"text":"First of all when the hostess seated us I asked if we can sit closer in instead of being right next to the door since there's legit 10 other seats open, she said \"sure\" rudely and didn't even look at me when she replied. Later I saw her saying something to our waitor, he ignored us and LEGIT SKIPPED US WHEN HE WAS REFILLING WATER. I was also try to get his attention to get some hot sauce I HAD TO ASK ANOTHER TABLE WAITOR CAUSE OUR IGNORED US. We got the octopus ball which is way too much batter and not enough octopus, we also ordered tonkatsu ramen with extra pork. OKAY THE PORK IS BURNED and the broth is COLD. I paid extra for rich broth which tasted so bland it look like they used FLINT, MI water for the broth, don't even waste your money. LARGE PARTY? Forget it cause the restaurant have no space. Didn't leave a tip for sure since the WAITOR DECIDED TO IGNORED US. DONT COME HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE TASTE BUDS OF STARVING NORTH KOREANS CAUSE ITS THE WORST RAMEN IVE EVER HAD AND IM ASIAN AND IVE HAD PLENTY. MOST UNAUTHENTIC ASIAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD. Wouldn't want to see a white guy makes Asian food unless he's Gordan Ramsay. How about hire some real server and not some JUSTIN BIEBER LOOKING BRAT AND FLAT CHESTED 2011 LINDSEY LOHAN. And watch they're going to put this review in the \"not recommended reviews\" to hide their bad service. IM NOT THE FIRST TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT BAD SERVICES, look at others reviews before trying out this place."}
{"text":"This was my first real ramen.  It was an exceptional experience.  The food was excellent (spicy miso and the dumplings).  Service was great.  The store was plenty large enough to feel cosy but not cramped.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite Ramen Place. 

Pro:
- Servers generally friendly. I never personally had issue with any of my servers.
- Chasu Tonkatsu ramen is so good! Broth a lil on the  bland side in my opinion but works good with combination of green onions, soft boiled egg and mushroom. If you like meat order extra Chasu (Grilled pork). IT SO YUMMY MAKES ME WANT SOME RIGHT NOW.
- One of the best place to get Kakuni (Braised Pork Ribs)
- If you are a fan of Japanese food or culture, you can also get Tako (\"octopus ball\") here to try and selection of Japanese beers. 

Cons:
- I think they need to hire more server especially for their busier hours. There are time I had to wait for longer than acceptable for sevice.
- The chair isnt the most comfortable thing to sit but I'll  live."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the Phoenix and East Valley areas!
The owners really care about their guests and are passionate about the quality of their food. I've been here several times now and will continue to return."}
{"text":"+ Rich Broth 
+ Noodles 
+ Good and Fast Service 
- Pork was too fatty 

Solid ramen place. I'm not too familiar with the ramen scene in the Phoenix area but in LA this holds up. I wouldn't say it's the best ever but it's solid with the flavor, richness, and creaminess of the broth, downside is it can be too creamy and a little salty and may over power the whole meal. I ordered the miso ramen and I love how the noodles were made al dente with the right amount of chewiness. 

Also my slice of pork was all fat and about 5% meat. Not a huge fan of that. The meat I could bite into had a smokey taste and really helped stand out next to the broth. 

Service was great and fast but then again I went right when it opened and not a lot of people were there. Ramen comes out quick!

If you like the broth thick and creamy, with al dente noodles this would be a good place to try out if you're in the area. Lots of parking in the plaza and you have access to the Starbucks wifi next door! I would come here again given the chance."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a regular here! The place is the BEST ramen in Tempe/Chandler by far. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Get the Tonkotsu Ramen and you're set. 

If you're going with bae, I highly recommend NOT getting two ramen bowls. Try to get a rice bowl and a ramen bowl and just share! I would recommend all of them. If you are feeling fancy, get the octopus balls. 10/10 would recommend. Now, unless you're really really hungry, disregard bae and get the ramen bowl."}
{"text":"Omgg I LOVE this place!! I've been searching for a good ramen spot ever since I moved to the Phoenix/ Mesa area, and Tampopo is the best place I've found!

Everything I've tried so far has been amazing -I always love to add menma, but I'd be happy enough with just the basics of soft boiled egg and slice of pork... it's really the broth that makes their ramen so great in comparison to any other place I've tried in Arizona! 

They've always been crowded when I've come, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. It's definitely worth it tho, or you could always do take-out! Also, while I think their portions are pretty generous, you can add extra noodles at like no cost (or maybe $1 at most?). 

My only advice would be to stay away from the optional hot sauce -it's like $1 but just tastes synthetic.. like there's only an extreme spice but no added flavor. That's the only thing that's not really worth it imo :)"}
{"text":"First time trying ramen and it was delicious!! The presentation was beautiful! The staff was happy,helpful, and attentive! It took less then 10 minutes to get our food! Plus they are constantly refilling your waters. I will come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"I was a little scared to try this as I don't venture from my normal plain boring restaurants. But it was Amazing, no more than amazing. I love the Ramen, have been back 3 times now, and plan on a few more. The restaurant was quaint, and modern."}
{"text":"Love ramen and wanted to try this place. Last review was four days ago but when I showed up last night with a friend the windows were boarded with wood and a sign in front said it was temporarily closed due to unforeseen circumstances and would reopen soon. I'd like a new ramen place and the pictures look great. Hope it isn't permanent. 

UPDATE! They reopened this week. I will see you for a lengthy meal this week. So excited to try everything here!"}
{"text":"First off as you walk in through the door to your right you can see that they make their noodles in house giving a nice fresh taste to the ramen here vs. other places that don't. The broth is descent and selection of toppings is on par with other places. Close to LA standards and you can't go wrong on a cold day. Seating is tight and limited or crowded at times which makes it seem like you're in Japan. Service can be hit and miss but all in all a good experience and a good Bowl of noodles!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I had pretty low expectations considering I was looking for ramen in Phoenix. They make their ramen fresh and you can tell. I got the ultra spicy ramen and it was really good. I would only make the color normal.

Dinner
* Ultra Spicy Ramen (Excellent)"}
{"text":"Tampopo Ramen is by far the best ramen place in Az.  Everything about my bowel was very tasty.  I had the meso ramen and it was quite filling.  While I would have liked to ask for seconds I'm already fighting off the food coma so that would pretty much have been my downfall.  Friendly staff is also a huge plus."}
{"text":"Not bad, good actually...comforting Ramen in a small space. Reminded me of a Manhattan ramen joint. It was packed at 6:30pm small que out the door. College kids, family's and even some seniors. They make the noodles on sight.  Friendly and fast service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, I love takoyaki here..super delicious. Although the ramen doesn't have a lot of meat like in the Vietnamese and Chinese restaurant but the soup is delightful and rich."}
{"text":"I was greeted although it was pretty busy. The waiter gave me time to look over the menu and explained a few things on there. He also gave me water while I reviewed the menu without being prompted. I ended up ordering the grilled octopus and Tonkotsu ramen with added seaweed and pork belly. The sauce was a little different but otherwise really good. Love that they make their noodles in house! This is definitely a place I'll be visiting frequently when I finally move here."}
{"text":"The tonkatsu ramen
The biggest seller for me about this place is that they make their noodles in house, and you can see it!

Lightish broth (maybe I'm used to heavier), perfectly cooked egg with decent toppings.
I love that they have the option for extra noodles. The noodles were cooked al dente, just like I like them.

Overall it was delicious and a pretty decent value. I would come back again. Slurp slurp."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place is food. The Ramen noodles are easily the most flavorful, tasty that I have had in the entire valley. I have been to at least six other places and I do my best to avoid them all in place of Tampopo.

When you walk in they say \"moshi moshi\". It's fun! Give the extra spicy ramen a shot!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first one and it's actually really good. Nice atmosphere with good food. Totally gives you Japanese vibes and you feel you are dining somewhere in Japan. Liked the miso soup, noodles, pork, and even I didn't try the rice bowls but it looked amazing. Definitely will go back here and try different items out of menu. It's affordable too."}
{"text":"Had the best food there.  The selection is good and the  food is perfect.  They have a good mix of spicy and non spicy meals. I'm a wimp so I look for non spicy options.  Glad to see such a great place move into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love ramen and this place is the best. The service is excellent and the people who worked here they are all pretty cool. I would recommend this place if ever you visit Phoenix, Arizona. I had braised pork belly, it's literally melt in your mouth. And tonkotsu ramen, the best!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter is an ASU student and we go here for dinner when I am in town both she and her room mate love it.  I do as well. They often split the miso soup and a pork bun with green tea."}
{"text":"They make fresh noodles here.  The space is tight so don't come in big groups.  The staff are friendly.  I think the tonkatsu is their best bowl of noodles.  This is def one of the best ramen joints in the valley."}
{"text":"It rained today so I wanted to eat some ramen! I'm so happy to have found Tampopo Ramen! Seeing a line right when I pulled up into the parking lot was already a good indication that this place was going to be the bomb!

The restaurant is not very big but it makes up by having a friendly staff and nice family atmosphere! 

I tried several side dishes and it was all yummy! My favorite was the Takoyaki! It was cooked to perfection in my opinion. The outside was nice and crisp while the inside was so soft! The stuffing and sauce was very tasteful! Make sure you order this side dish! You will not be disappointed. 

Now let's get to what you come here for and that's the Ramen! First thing first they make their own noodles so that's already a plus! The noodles were thick and had a distinct taste! I paid the extra $1 for the rich soup and that was a so worth it! The ramen was so good I ate like no one was watching! Slurp slurp! 

They do serve alcohol here so don't be shy and enjoy a nice cold one while you enjoy your Ramen! 

The staff was so nice and was very attentive to us! I highly recommend if you are craving for some Ramen this is the spot to go to!"}
{"text":"I lived in Tokyo for over 3 years and consumed all sorts of noodles almost everyday from little side street, quick serve ramen shops to full menu, full service restaurants.

I found Tampopo a decent pretender that serves Americanized food.

The Tonkotsu Ramen was unremarkable.  The noodles almost had the correct texture, but were too chewy. The egg was poached correctly and the pork was over-salted in lieu of the correct seasoning., The rest of the ingredients were so-so.  The broth did not help as it had none of the depth it should.

The Miso Ramen was a near cousin to the Tonkotsu and was also unremarkable.  The broth had none of the richness it should have.

Avoid the Green Tea. It barely had any hint of the burnt rice or green tea flavorings tea should.  It is a watered down, Westernized version that is probably devoid of any healthful Catechins and digestive benefits.  Be advised that it too has been further Americanized because, at $2 a cup, that does not include any refills.

If you are looking for real Asian Ramen Noodles, go elsewhere.  Based on my two visits, this place has cut too many corners Westernizing its flavors to maximize its profits,  When little, quick serve Ramen shops can get it \"right\" everyday, Tampopo is too Westernized for me.

If Westernized commercialized bland ramen is good enough for you, then you'll be happy with Tampopo.

In my opinion, if you want authentic ramen done right with the right depth, richness-sweetness (not sugary, if you really know your Asian foods) and the flavorings it should have, then this is not the place."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and enjoyed it every time. The ramen is decent, and their chashu/kakuni/karaage is great. They're very friendly and recognize us whenever we come in. Their takoyaki and gyoza were both good, but on my first visit I thought their tonkotsu broth was a bit bland. I'd noticed they offered \"rich soup\" (more concentrated soup) for a dollar extra, and it's definitely worth it. It adds much more flavor and I'd recommend it to anybody stopping by. I never order ramen here without it. All in all, I really enjoy this place, and I'd rate it in the top 2 with Umami (which is currently closed) for best ramen in the area."}
{"text":"Clean & inviting but the place is a little cramped and probably not the best for small children! Overall the food was good and presented very nicely! My pork katsu ramen was yummy, but didn't have enough meat. I'll definitely be coming back for more though!"}
{"text":"This place was the best... our server was great, I would definitely go back and recommend this place... love the spicy miso ramen!!!!"}
{"text":"Tampopo Ramen is the place to be if you are craving delicious Ramen. My husband and I love this place. Great speedy service, good crew and hip atmosphere. Don't miss out it's gooooood!!!"}
{"text":"Ramen was delicious and reasonably priced.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"Classic ramen shop. The price for it is about average for a specialty store. I recommend ordering anything with pork belly to get the full ramen experience. The seating is more about quantity than comfort, so eat quickly and privately."}
{"text":"On my Arizona trip, trying out the Ramen place over here.  First time seeing red, spicy noodle.  Had to give it a try, I just love spice.  Did not disappoint, it is pretty good place.  Love the spicy Noodle."}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of this place.  I have friends that say it is their favorite.  I've seen a crowd here and was really excited to try it.  The service was basic and the seating is cramped and uncomfortable.  I found the ramen to be edible but nothing great.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles as much as I do from Republic ramen.  The agadashi tofu was good and they have ramun soda."}
{"text":"Okay maybe I'm terribly spoilt given that I've had ramen in a lot of places. I guess living in Asia for 12 years might also help. But this place was decidedly average and I had really high hopes for it, especially since Phoenix is missing a truly great ramen shop. I felt the noodles lacked consistency and were overdone. It didn't have the springy, al dented feel you get when you dive into a real bowl of ramen. The cha sui was dry, thinly sliced and lacked flavor. The soup base, which is arguably the most important part of the bowl since it brings it all together and acts to unify the entire experience felt like it was just an after thought here. Just a simple soup base to keep the ramen warm. The egg was also fully cooked through. I am telling you, you haven't had egg until you've eaten a half boiled egg in spicy ramen broth. 

Maybe this place deserves another chance but I live on the north west side of Glendale so I might not really be able to get another chance to stop by that way."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You won't find better ramen in the valley. Fresh made noodles. The pork belly is very juicy. Spicy miso ramen is delicious. I always add an extra egg and pork. Big bowl of Ramen.  There was also a started of chicken nugget things that was incredible! 
It's a small space and can get very busy so not the best place for big groups or any privacy."}
{"text":"Based on my one visit to the place, I would say it's one of the best, if not top 1, ramen in the Phoenix area. They make noodles in house and ingredients all taste good. The only complaint I have is that the space is too small and I wouldn't want to hang out with a group of friends there. I think the owner wanted to have high turnover to increase revenue, which makes sense to me. Good for groups of four or less."}
{"text":"Real ramen in AZ? Yes, it exists!  So happy that this place has opened up.  My only complaint was that my egg was a bit hard....and cold in the center. Other than that, I would love to give it another try and I'm not complaining too much since Phoenix and surrounding areas are in desperate need of good ramen!  Enough with the Korean-owned and flavored ramen places around here! Note: they use the thin, straight noodles so don't expect that \"chew\" that many ramen places have. Still good though."}
{"text":"Super authentic, which apparently shows my immature pallet. I just can't fall in love with their ramen dishes despite two attempts. It's super good...but I've got a favorite spot just up the road. 

I've had both regular ramen, and I've had the miso spicy. The pork over rice bowl is a great appetizer. 

Place is tiny, but they are efficient and service is top notch. If you're looking for authentic Japanese cuisine, you'll be hard pressed to find better. 

Prices aren't cheap, but neither is the food, ambiance or experience. It's all really good...but I guess I just prefer a more \"basic\" offering."}
{"text":"Over rated ramen noodle, the design of the place is not very smart idea, very tight space, have to share space with stranger, imagine when its busy, they doesnt even have space for the waiting area. Service was ok, the servers were very polite, but not efficient, could be better train.  
Food was not special at all, maybe after reading all the good reviews, the expectation were high.  The broth was very plain, not much favor, noodle is ok, not as special as the review said.
Overall 2 star"}
{"text":"Over rated - Ramen . Doesn't compare to many others in the valley -- don't know what the big deal is - I guess they don't know good ramen from average .. 
Served appetizer with our entree .. NO Timing & pace ..Had to ask for napkins 3x , must be a paper short shortage or cost cutting effort. Not a big fan of the wooden soup spoons as hard to sanitize these. 

Small Resturant it's costerphobic in the restaurant-- chairs / stools are very uncomfortable and people waiting to be seated are huddled all over the place ."}
{"text":"Excellent handmade ramen noodles and the broth is really good. This ain't no dehydrated noodle bag crap. This is the real deal. I highly recommend getting the braised pork belly. It melts in your mouth it's so good."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open, and I've had been waiting to try it for weeks! Sadly... The experience was not good.

I showed up here on the most ridiculously busy Monday evening. I understood I would wait until there was an open spot at the bar, do I waited about ten minutes. Not bad.

Then I sat down, I had a corner spot but a waitress walked by me a lot and for twenty minutes she didn't speak to me. Then she brought me a menu and left. Ten minutes later I knew what I wanted but didn't see any servers available. Finally a taller, college age guy took my order and I asked for a water.

The food took almost thirty minutes. And I didn't get a water until after my food came. I ordered the spicy miso with rich broth and my partner ordered the tonkatsu with rich broth and braised pork.
The spicy miso had an okay broth, the pork wasn't amazing, but atleast the egg was okay. The tonkatsu wasn't the best, it had the rich flavor added and I thought without it, it would be way to watery and bland.

The check took too long, and while I know times can be busy, it still sucks to have wait staff that have far too many people at a time to deal with. At that point there should've been a manager on the floor helping out.

I probably won't be back again. My thought is that I might try take out with them and see how it goes."}
{"text":"We had the spicy miso ramen & takoyaki, oh my gosh both are perfect! Its a must to come back here! The employees are all nice & very accommodating!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The set-up is a little odd, a huge high-top running straight down the middle of the restaurant with smaller tables and a counter off to the side.  The high-top is weird because you are sometimes sitting elbow-to-elbow with other strangers.

The tonkotsu ramen was great.  My BF got the super spicy ramen which was a little too spicy (and our tolerance for spice is high!)  The gyoza we had as an appetizer was good.

Recommended for an authentic Japanese ramen experience in a trendy Tempe setting."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaas the best ramen ever slay the only good ramen in az tbh go here or you'll be sorry"}
{"text":"??????????????
I lived in Japan for 5 years and I've tried a couple ramen places around town after getting back. Rubbish all of them. This place though is the closest to Japan I've tasted. I had the miso ramen and the egg was perfectly cooked. The broth was thick and yummy. Whenever I feel homesick for Japan, I like to come here."}
{"text":"My experience at this place was not very good. When we walked in all the chefs tried to speak japanese to make it feel authentic. Sadly their japanese didn't resemble the phrase they were trying to say, it was just gibberish. The seating is quite uncomfortable and the whole place is small. The wait staff wasn't very attentive and screwed up my entire tables orders. The seafood ramen wasn't very good at all. The shrimp wasn't devained so blood from it got all the place. The noodles were the weirdest noodles I've ever had and the taste was strange. The prices were high for the quality of food I received. I will not be going back here and honestly there are way better ramen places around. Don't waste your time...very disappointed. Hopefully it will get better in time."}
{"text":"Ordered the miso ramen, added pork belly. It was rich and yummy! Everything came separately so you could \"soup fresh. 

I'm going to try to eat in next time, I have a feeling it will be even better (and my egg won't be overlooked from sitting in the box)."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I know I didn't get what I wanted but no one who worked there could help. My girlfriend liked it. 
I didn't even eat what I ordered and that is crazy, I like food."}
{"text":"Come here way to often :) I love the ramen so good, make sure to add rich soup if you like a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Seemed like a tasty place, pretty small with bar style seating. Kind of disappointed with vegetarian options. I was confused by what was in fact was available when I asked the server. I ordered the soy based milky broth by her recommendation. It tasted like warm silk with noodles and spices. I was definitely bummed. Everything looks delicious. Wished there were more veggie friendly options."}
{"text":"Everything I have been wanting in a proper ramen house! I have eaten at the majority of others in the phoenix metro and the were average at best. This is Tokyo in your face and top notch from the noodles to the added items. The appetizers were excellent and I highly encourage to step out of your comfort zone and explore.  Definitely returning soon."}
{"text":"If you want a legit bowl of ramen, then this is your place. Best ramen I've had in Arizona. They make their ramen noodles in house! How awesome is that? Everyone who gave this place less than three stars are a bunch of mouth breathers. Try it out for yourself and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The spicy miso ramen. It was different from my usual tan tan men at Cherry blossom in Phoenix. The ramen was incredibly salty, but not bad. Probably not my next ramen place. The gyoza was pretty bomb though.  Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Went last night with my pals. Ive been a handful of time but this was the first time trying their ramen. Normally with ramen I have to stop because I get so full but I got the Seafood Ramen and Takoyaki and I ate all of it. My friends were all very very happy with what they got! I love that they put full prawns and yummy pieces of squid in the broth. It was extremely delicious.  The only down side is our checks got messed up pretty bad and had to be adjusted twice but no worries, it was pretty busy when we were there! It was easily fixed. The place is pretty small but I think gives a full, fast pace ambiance to enjoy good conversation with your friends. Totally coming back again when I crave some delicious noods."}
{"text":"Not the best that I've had, but definitely the best thing I've tasted in awhile for Arizona standards. The picture I posted is the miso ramen and the broth tasted a bit weird, I think it was from the corn. The regular kon ramen was good too, the broth was salty, but in a good way. Some people would say it doesn't have any flavor, but it was okay. The gyoza was delicious and the pork buns were a little bit spicy. I'm used to saimin which has thicker noodles, so the thin noodles were a bit different for me. The pork in the ramen was a bit burnt, but you get passed that, still alright. I'd go back here every once in awhile, but it wasn't good enough to drag me back every weekend. My brother got the extra spicy ramen and my uncle received the spicy ramen, the regular spicy definitely isn't as spicy as you would think. Extra spicy probably has sriracha in it because it made the noodles super red. They both said it was decent, but they rather have the miso or ton ramen next time. Still a good place."}
{"text":"As far as Phoenix ramen joints go, this is definitely not one to miss. Great starter pork buns and quite a few varieties of ramen, my favorite being the ultra spicy one. Also always appreciate fresh tasting noodles, clearly not from a bag."}
{"text":"What can you really say, in Arizona options for good authentic ramen are extremely limited. The pros about this place are the noodles are very good and fresh and are prepared in house as demonstrated by the little room where you can see they are made. The cons however is the tonakatsu soup is fairly weak and not rich as it should be, they do however have a weird option though for adding additional flavor to the broth for an extra $1 which is ridiculous in my opinion. The chashu I also found to be a bit tough and about 75% fat.  Overall the best in Arizona but that is not saying a lot so if you go in with low expectations you will enjoy it. I give the owners props however for trying and hope they improve on what they have."}
{"text":"Everything here left us wanting more.  For starters we ordered the takoyaki and the hirata buns.  For entrees we went with the Tonkotsu and seafood ramen.  

The ramen came out well before the starters and, as other reviewers have said, the broth was flavorless. Even compared to other ramen places in Phoenix this was bland and watery.  I added corn ($2) which ended up being a small portion of canned corn.  Both of the apps were just OK.  The hirata buns could have been much better with less mayo and no lettuce and there was way more dough than octopus in the takoyaki.

Service was also mediocre.  There were only a couple of servers for the entire place so things  just slipped through the cracks. It was impossible to get a refill on water and the servers kept asking what we were waiting on.  I overheard other tables asking for items that never showed up to be taken off the bill.  

Next time I have a ramen craving I'll go back to Dozo."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The photos made it look so promising! But in all reality, it was just okay.

On our visit, we ordered:
Hirata Bun - I dream of Ippudo NY's pork buns and even though I didn't expect it to taste as good as theirs, I was hoping it would help ease that craving a little bit. It was not even close. I did not enjoy anything about this. The roast pork was very mild, the bun wasn't as soft and was way too big for the amount of pork in it. The sauce not only did not work with the flavors, but there was also too much of it. 

Tonkotsu Ramen - Broth was just okay. I felt like it was missing something. The ingredients in it were good, though. We added braised pork belly & bamboo, which were surprisingly really tender and tasty. There was ample amount of noodles. We also ordered an extra side of it, but it was not necessary.  

Karaage Chicken Rice Bowl - Heaps amount of rice and a small portion of chicken. There's more chicken in an 8 piece box of nuggets at Chick Fil-A! & I paid $2 extra for the \"large\" bowl. I can't even imagine the portion of the small one. The chicken was pretty good along with the pickled green veggies that accompanied it. Even though I took a spoonful of rice with each chicken piece, in the end I was still left with enough rice to fill 3/4 of the bowl. 

It's not a place I would rush back to eat again. Service was pretty good. Nothing bad but nothing remarkable, either. They had way too many staff for the amount of customers and the small size of the place. Majority of the time, they were just standing around chatting with each other."}
{"text":"Definitely best ramen spot in Tempe. The seating is really awkward but the ramen is so worth it. Great quality, not overly salty, and order is spot on every time. Employees are friendly too. I would recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"The fact that they make their own noodles is awesome!  I wish this place was closer I'd go more often.  The only miss for me was the pork.  It was hard, and didn't break apart easily.  That makes it difficult to eat when all you got is a spoon and chopsticks.  But I'm not going to dwell on one thing when the rest was so good.  Totally worth stopping in.  I'll try to get here at least once a month considering I live up in Scottsdale and there is NO ramen here."}
{"text":"Attentive service in a casual, laid back atmosphere.  The feel of the tables, chairs, and condiments on a little tray at each table was reminiscent of the noodle shops in Southeast Asia I used to go to for lunch.

Tonkotsu ramen was satisfying. Fresh noodles made on premises. The broth had a nice depth  of flavor.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the soymilk ramen on the menu too and plan to try it next time. My boyfriend had it and enjoyed.

My favorite add-ons like menma, nitamago, and kakuni were also available and quite flavorful."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars for the atmosphere, broth, and service. 4 stars for the noodles.
Even though we showed up 30 minutes before close, they were very accommodating and did not rush us. We ordered a plate of takoyaki, a spicy miso, and a soymilk ramen.

The takoyaki was the freshest I've had in Arizona--octopus was not too chewy, batter was cooked just right. Sometimes, restuarants make it too gooey, tasteless, or chewy, but Tampopo gave us none of those issues.

The spicy miso soup was excellent--try this if you like spicy, but have never been here before. If you want spicier, come back next time to amp up the heat with their ultra spicy ramen!

The soymilk ramen was also excellent--light, and not as meaty as the tonkotsu broth, but tasted just as creamy. It was not disappointing.

The noodles are not the typical curly noodles, they are thinner. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy these types of noodles in my soup, but for others, it may be their favorite. Hence, the 4 stars--good, but didn't go well with the bowl. 

We have leftovers, and the broth was even more delicious the second night!"}
{"text":"Had the Miso Ramen and added braised pork belly.  The ingredients were all very fresh.  Like said elsewhere here, it is refreshing to see many Japanese dining here for Lunch.  Lived in Okinawa for a year and I definitely recommend a visit to this Ramen House."}
{"text":"Been waiting some time to offer up a review of Tampopo, the first serious effort of Japanese Ramen in the metro area. It's seem the very day they opened Ramen joints suddenly started sprouting up all over the valley.  Having tried most, no other's are worth noting except for Niskikawa 'neighborhood style' in Chandler,  a truly unique bowl for serious Ramenites. 

Walking into Tompopo you really get that feel of a fast-paced Tokyo Ramen joint ... love it or hate it ... there's no middle ground. Eat your noodles and get out kind of place, but not soup Nazi, think fast friendly service. While the uninitiated may at first feel insecure, sit down and persevere, this is a must try culinary experience!

For novices I recommend ordering the basic bowl as there's already a lot going-on-in-there. The $1-3 add-on toppings tend to complicate the already well balanced flavor. Also don't forget the must have side order of Yaki Goyza. A glass of Asahi draft beer from Japan rounds out the experience. 

Obviously I'm a regular at Tompopo, but I'm also their toughest critic as I travel regularly to Japan. While their overall consistency has improved, disappointingly their Ramen has not, nor has their menu expanded as I hoped.  Still frozen at 3.5 stars.  Tough love aside,  Tompopo is an excellent introduction to Japanese style Ramen ... and my go to place for a quick fix in the Valley of the Sun.

Get yourself a bowl ..."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the ramen I got but personally I didn't enjoy it very much. 
I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen added with the rich broth. It wasn't too spicy to the point where I couldn't eat it but I wasn't used to the thickness of the broth and with the spo unless, it made the broth hard to eat. I couldn't taste the \"rich\" broth but I wasn't sure if it's because the broth was spicy and it had over powered the entire ramen 
The pork however was good and I want to say that in the TEMPE area, they probably made their pork the best, unless you count Fujiya Market as a ramen restaurant on Saturdays. 
The noodles are also different from typical ramen noodles and I wasn't really sure what it was, but I think I would have prefer the normal ones. These are my personal preference. 

HOWEVER, my friend did get the spicy miso, and he enjoyed it greatly while my cousin got the basic tonkotsu with rich broth but she didn't like either. Maybe it was the rich broth that ruined it for us. 

Pricing isn't too bad but adding extra toppings can get expensive. And the service was quick. The decoration was very hip and I want to say that this place is made more for hipsters that want to try new style of food. It's good but not the best nor very traditional. Would I come back here? Yes to try other ramen."}
{"text":"5 stars hands down. I would give this place a 5-star rating if it were in LA...or Kyushu for that matter. Authentic housemade Hakata-style ramen (thin and al-dente). Pork is smokey and crispy on the outside. Broth is flavorful. If this place ever closes I will cry...Keep doing what you do Tampopo!"}
{"text":"Great ramen. Probably the best flavors and texture I've ever had for ramen... but I give them only 4 stars because the staff is miserable. If you watch them as they're cooking, they roll their eyes as customers come in (I think because they don't want any more customers or they're too busy or they hate their job) and have a huge attitude problem. They mumble stuff under their breath and absolutely don't want to be there. Not sure if the management is bad to them or if it's just them having a bad day but this has happened 3 out of my last 5 visits. I'm a big believer of making food with LOVE and passion and these kids (most of them are college kids) don't understand that.. Haven't been back for 3 months so I'm hoping they changed their attitude."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. I ordered the spicy miso ramen. There was not even a hint of spice in it. Really disappointing. I got my food to go, so I could not even ask for an adjustment."}
{"text":"I love Tampopo! They have the best Takoyaki I've ever eaten and I love their hirata buns. The rice balls are also amazing with pork inside. As for ramen goes, I love that you can order more noodles. Only other place I've known that does that is a ramen shop in LA. I'm sure it's common, but not in Arizona! I always get the broth with more flavor. I've only tried the Tonkatsu ramen so far, I can't seem to stray away! I still have a hard time deciding if I want to go to Cherry Blossom or Dozo Izakaya for ramen, but tampopo is much closer to me and I love all their other foods!"}
{"text":"So I've been here literally 20+ times.  It's a great place although too small.  VERY busy pretty much at all time so either expect a wait or get there at an odd time.  Hopefully they create another location in N Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is alright. As far as ramen goes not the best, even in the valley. Very clean and for the money it's alright. Lacks flavor and the gyoza was cold when it got to us."}
{"text":"Disappointed... Really wanted ramen but was a let down.  Very take out seating and not much flavor in the soup.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed - my boyfriend and I are transplants and are in search of our go-to ramen spot. We were really hoping, from reading all the wonderful reviews, that this would be the place. 

The menu is full and has all the things you might want to get: agedashi tofu, takoyaki, soyu ramen, tonkatsu, and more. Presentation is great too, but the composition of the ramen was just not there. Even before taking my first bite, I knew that the ramen was over cooked - the noodles were heavy and well soaked with water and broth. Albeit, when I went to slurp the noodles, they were soft and lacked the nimble, light texture. 

My boyfriend got the ultra spicy ramen, the extra spicy tonkotsu broth, which sounds amazing, minus that this bowl was a goop of oil. The ramen was spicy, as named, but I think only because the broth was drowned in chili oil."}
{"text":"Personally, I think it was good just not as good as all the hype that my friends built up for this place. I think the problem is that I am vegetarian and their veggie soup is nearly tasteless and almost makes you feel sick if you eat too much at once. I'd just like a vegetarian soup that isn't so heavy and soy milk based. Have always had a wonderful experience here when I come with friends though. Small, but very lovely."}
{"text":"The homemade noodles were the absolute best I've ever had, the customer service was fantastic and they brought everything out fairly quick! Only complaint is that unffortunately half the meat that came in my ramen was quite dry."}
{"text":"Big shoutout to one of the sous chefs, Brandon, whom I had the pleasure of UBERing to work here last week. He raved about the authentic chef, the legit homemade noodles & said they were the best ramen places in town for an authentic ramen experience. 
So, of course, I had to cash in here once my ramen craving struck & it did not disappoint! Holy crap! I'm in tastebud heaven! I don't know what they do to that rind of pork they roast and add to the original ramen, but it is the BOMB.com! (& I am not normally a pork fan).
& the gyoza, deeelish! Pan-seared & super fresh!
& their curry rivals any authentic Indian curry restaurant all day long. 
This stuff is sooooo good, soul-satisfying, tasty, delicious, authentic food! I'm so happy about the food I can't think of more creative adjectives beyond authentic and delicious! Just go! It won't disappoint.
You'd nearly miss it tucked in between a Starbucks and great clips, but don't! 
It's so worth it!
I carried out, but the whole ginormous bowl and ladle for a spoon experience looked like something worth going back for to dine in!
Excited to find this place! & hope people like you continue to go to make that possible!
Truly a gem!
Thanks, B.! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Nothing special as a ramen restaurant. Noodles are a bit dry, soup is average comparing with those ramen restaurants in L.A."}
{"text":"Tampopo is pretty solid ramen, especially for AZ. The noodles are made in house and the portions are large. I was able to share my bowl with my S.O. since we ordered the dumplings as an appetizer.

Overall, the food is good. I was very impressed with the dumplings. Perfectly cooked and delicious. The pork in my ramen was fairly dry and the broth was a bit bland. I recommend the spicy miso for anyone trying to avoid the blandness."}
{"text":"Their soymilk ramen was great! I will definitely come back to try some of their other items. Absolutely would recommend this place to some of you ramen lovers."}
{"text":"A no-fuss, food-focused ramen place. I found this place through Yelp and my husband and I decided to give it a try since we don't have many opportunities for authentic ramen. We were blown away by the food! Simple but amazing and authentic. The place was packed, with what seemed like lots of regulars. Don't be fooled by the simple decor and small space, this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen and I love the spicy noodles!  Very quick service and food arrival. They even had some Japanese beers I had never heard of. I'll be coming back for sure and will ask for extra broth next time because unlike most people I actually finish my broth every time!"}
{"text":"Outstanding small noodle house ... With a sushi bar feel... The spicy ramen noodle soup was delicious"}
{"text":"When you get right down to it, the ramen here should be better. It has all the earmarks of a great place: house made noodles, attentive staff, tightly packed setting. In the end, it's a little lackluster. I had the tonkotsu. The broth lacked any real depth of flavor, the pork lacked tenderness, the noodles we're a little dense. It wasn't as bad as that all sounds. It was perfectly acceptable, but nothing special. I dinner with my boss, who had the ultra spicy ramen. He added fried chicken on the recommendation of our server. He enjoyed it, but ultimately felt the same as me: not bad, but nothing to get worked up about. He mentioned the ultra spicy was every bit as spicy as the name would suggest. Prices are reasonable. Service is a win. Madonna and the pop hits of the 80s playing overhead was a little odd. It won't change your life, but I'd recommend it if you were looking for a quick noodle fix and it was close."}
{"text":"Update: I went back and had another great experience! I came with some friends instead of coming alone this time and the service was quite a bit speedier than the first time I came so I'm willing to forgive the slight waits I had the first time even more. We got the kara age as an appetizer which was very nicely cooked but if I were to make one suggestion it would be to include some Japanese mayo or at least some kind of sauce to dip the chicken in. The salt was good but a little plain. My friends loved their tonkotsu and spicy miso bowls and I got myself another seafood ramen (the taste of shrimp with these noodles is just too good) and we look forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"I was waiting to try a ramen place for a while and this just hit the spot. I tried spicy miso ramen with rich soup. It was tasty, and I like the balance of oil and flavour in it. The service was good as when asked, waitress explained us things in detail, so that we can make good choice. Also, seating place is tight, but I liked it as it gives feeling of being in Japan."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat ignorant when it comes to the slurpy world of Ramen but I know I a satisfying meal.  Who doesn't like a pile favorite foods casually bathing in a rich broth?  I'm still on the front end of my learning curve as I still leave the place with a shirt dripping in lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! I always get the miso, last time we also got their fried chicken which was soooo good. Definitely getting that again. The restaurant is pretty small, but cozy. I think they make their noodles from scratch, but I don't know if I'm remembering wrong. 

The serving sizes are perfect, and I really love how close it is to me! It's not as good as Umami that was on Mill Ave (now gone ;-;) but still pretty nice. 

There's also another ramen place right across the street, but I wouldn't even bother if I were you."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen!   You walk in and get the immediate authentic feel and smell.   Server was great, she explained the process and options.   My girlfriend loves ramen and she gave this place a great recommendation.   Try the spicy noodles!"}
{"text":"I LOVE ramen. And I LOVE the movie Tampopo. So maybe I had really high expectations for this place...

This place just does not do it for me. I really appreciate the open kitchen and home-made noodles, and I think it is great that they have even altered the noodle with a spicy version if you so choose...but the broth is just not my favorite. And the broth is critical to a good bowl of ramen!

I like a simple, clear broth which is tasty; this is not an option at Tampopo. The closest is the Tonkotsu - which in my opinion is too opaque and bland for my taste. I have had bowls of ramen at other restaurants (and home-made) which had much more clarity and much more flavor. It was necessary to add the hot pepper seasoning and a little soy sauce to give the broth more depth. Some people really enjoy a fatty piece of meat and while the pork was tasty, there was a tad too much fat for me. The toppings were fine, but my goodness how could NARUTO not be an option for an addition at this restaurant?!? If you have seen Tampopo, you would know that this is a traditional topping to ramen. Just look up Tampopo Ramen Master scene or check out this link in YouTube - https://youtu.be/6WrkdTrrwew. This is how a bowl of ramen should be made, and eaten. I understand that being in AZ we cannot always expect the same traditional Japanese ingredients in our food; however, this a frozen item than can be obtained at a local Asian market. It baffles me.

The appetizers are good, especially the Hirata buns, pork belly, and takoyaki. There are more interesting ones that I want to try, but I am just not sure I will visit this place again because I do not like the soup. Tampopo is really close to my neck of the woods so this is quite saddening to me!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen to satisfy the craving. Absolutely one of my favorite placea to visit! The portion is perfect, not to small or too big. The atmosphere is welcoming. Spicy miso ramen is my favorite!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we ever tried for ramen and we just keep coming back to it because NO OTHER places we've tried since compare!

Why we keep coming back compared to other places:
**the broth is thick and flavorful, every other place has runny clear broth not oil infused or garnished
**the pieces of sliced pork are heavenly, they are delicious and flavorful, a nice cooked char that nobody else takes the time to do
**the ramen is made in house, they have a small room to your right as soon as you walk in. You can see the machine and the ramen knots placed carefully in racks
**the employees and cooks are friendly and everything is out in the open. There are no secrets; in fact, you can sit in the booth area facing the cooks so you can see them making all these delicious creations as you enjoy your ramen.
**the topping are fresh and plentyful, I love their black fugus and the employees work hard to keep up with the demand
***they have a list full of other toppings that you can add (for a fee), I have NEVER seen this many options with others.

Beware: this place is SUPER small but the flavors can't be beat. If you have ever wandered about this please come to this place first. I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen. Prolly the best place for ramen in Phoenix. I have been to ramen republic and that's decent but the fresh noodles coupled by traditional broth is delicious. A must try if ur a ramen nerd!!"}
{"text":"It is just another regular US style ramen. The rice bowl is really small, the price is a little too high and most importantly, nothing special in particular."}
{"text":"This was excellent! I had the ultra spicy ramen with the soy milk base and it was superb. I'm glad that I found a Ramen place that has a vegetarian option, as it's next to impossible. 

I will definitely be back for the soy milk broth"}
{"text":"Good Welcome
Great Servers and CS
Best Prices 
Fresh noodles made from scratch \"soft\" 
Next to a Starbucks
Excellent broth 
Boiled Egg included in the price not like other places that u have to pay .99 extra for that
Authentic Japanese 
Hands Down the best Ramen in near Tempe and ASU area 
Forget the other places"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with what I got today. Ordered a Miso Ramen with a double order of pork and no scallions. Received a single tiny piece of pork and a hunk of scallions. Got charged for a double order of Pork despite getting nothing that even resembled my value. Step it up Tampopo I expect better from you."}
{"text":"Friendly environment, and very welcoming attitude from all the employees there. 
I love coming over here for the ramen but the hard boiled egg doesn't really do it for me so I just do w/out and it's still very delicious especially w/ extra pork. 
THEIR TAKOYAKI IS THE BEST. 
Their curry katsu was alright."}
{"text":"The best Ramen in metro Phoenix that I have had thus far. Being from a Japanese family, we are picky. The noodles are authentic, pork was tender, and egg was cooked perfectly. The service was exceptional, atmosphere was clean and pleasant. I wish they had Shoyu Ramen on the menu, but settled for the Tonkatsu Ramen and wasn't disappointed. I can't give it 5-stars because I like Monta's Ramen in Las Vegas better and they didn't have Shoyu Ramen on the menu, but I will be back since it is by far the best in Phoenix so far."}
{"text":"I love the ramen here...  my co worker is always saying \" noodle day\"  which means Tampopo!!!  I have now tried all the ramen bowls.   My favorite is the original!!!!   I recommend to try them all at least once. You cant go wrong either way!!!"}
{"text":"Being a bit of a ramen snob, I would still give Tampopo a solid 4 stars. Good. Acceptable. The best? No. The best in Arizona? Maybe. Arizona is lacking ramen spots lol so definitely a maybe.

Whatever you do, I advise you to PLEASE order your bowl of ramen with an additional $1 RICH broth. Their regular broth without the \"rich\" factor completely lacks flavor & texture. You aren't getting the full experience of how flavorful ramen should be without the added \"rich\" factor. Please take my word for this.

I'm a huge tonkatsu lover & the only reason I did not order their basic tonkatsu is because my fellow Yelper friend Rich advised me that their miso here was better than their tonkatsu. He was entirely right. I paid an additional $1 for the rich broth because I feared driving all the way out to Tempe just to receive a bland bowl of ramen. Hallelujah, the best $1 I've spent as an addition to a bowl of ramen.

I had their spicy miso ramen (with the rich broth for an additional $1 + nori - seaweed for an additional $1). Delicious! The broth was really good. I've had better, yes, but I really gotta give it to Tampopo for their spicy miso. Well done! The noodles were made beautifully. Possibly one of the best in-house made noodles I've ever had (I've tried over 20+ different ramen houses, so I think that sorta says a lot). The egg was I believe supposed to be soft boiled, but was a tad overcooked. The pork was a bit tough for my liking, but it had great flavor. My cousin got the regular tonkatsu. I decided to give her broth a try because I tend to lean towards that when it's my first time at any ramen house. Unfortunately...... it wasn't good. It was bland. The broth had no texture. It lacked flavor. I was a bit confused given that the miso broth they serve is a tonkatsu based miso broth. Yet the flavors were totally lacking and unbalanced as tonkatsu alone. I believe the reason for such a huge difference in broths was the added \"RICH\" broth? It really seems like the only explanation for it. Tampopo should highly consider boosting their regular tonkatsu broth by adding a bit of their rich broth just to bring out more flavors & give it a stronger kick. The regular tonkatsu broth was really lacking.

Side note: The bowl of spicy miso rich broth was as flavorful as regular bowls of ramen in Los Angeles. So if you want the true strong flavors of ramen, please, spend the extra 4 quarters on a tasty rich broth.

OVERALL: if I'm visiting family in Arizona, I'll come back & have Tampopo if I need a ramen fix. The rich spicy miso ramen is a solid choice. I would opt out on getting any regular broths unless they decide to boost the flavors of it. Thasssss jusssss my opinion :-)"}
{"text":"I would recommend recommend this place. The ramen soup is not done properly. There is a unpleasant smell to the soup, probably due to the fact that they didn't do a proper preparation to the pork bone. The noodle is ok. Chasiu is on the light side . The egg is the biggest disappointment."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband and son and the noodles are sooo good! The pork was also so well cooked and melted in your mouth"}
{"text":"ordered:
- tonkotsu ramen, extra chasyu pork
- curry don, kakuni [braised pork belly]

pros:
- the braised pork belly was the best, better than my ramen bowl probably
- great noodles
- pork was great
- kaedama system is great

cons:
- if i didnt order extra chasyu, i wouldve been sad
- my egg was a little overcooked
- needed more broth
- canned drinks

protip:
- \"Just touch it. Caress it with the chopstick tips. Gently pick it up and dip it into the soup on the right of the bowl. What's important here is to apologize to the pork by saying \"see you soon.\" Finally, start eating-the noodles first. Oh, at this time, while slurping the noodles, look at the pork.\""}
{"text":"We got Curry ramen, the flash fried wings, and a hirata bun (this was excellent and one is not enough !) They were all very tasty. For the curry Ramen, it's more of a sauce rather than a soup unlike most of the ramen dishes come. We recommend another one if you want a more soupy ramen (would be good for a winter lunch or dinner). You can also add additional toppings to your ramen like an egg, sprouts, corn, etc and of course pork belly which was the most ordered. Sit at the bar bc you can watch the amazing assembly line of chefs doing flash freezes to charring of the pork belly and ladling of the steamy noodles. Just the smell of this tiny resto made us want to go back before we tried our food. This place gets crowded for good reason so go there on a week day but if you love the excitement of the chaos, go on Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"This is the worst ramen I've ever had! the broth is so bland the spicy noodles that they served is so tough. \"TRUST ME IM ASIAN\" I've tried ramen in Japan, Honkong and even in Manila Philippines they don't served ramen like this. go get yourself a instant ramen and boil egg for 4 mins and eat it save you a lot of money less stress. But if you wanna ruin your day go ahead and go here. I am a chef to so I am exposed with so many dish. so that's  all for all the people who make such a good comments like \"Ohh this is the best ramen I've ever had\" well you just ruined my day, next time save up money and travel the world. thanks"}
{"text":"So happy to finally have found a delicious and authentic ramen place in the valley. The flavors were spot on and the ramen was delicious. Service was great. However, the place was a bit cramped, not much personal space between guests and I felt, for ramen, it was a bit overpriced. Overall, great food. I'll definitely come back and tell others about it."}
{"text":"It's a shame our experience has caused me to NEVER want to come back.

The food was great. I had the gyoza and the tonkotsu ramen. The ramen wasn't the best I'd ever had but pretty damn close. The broth was very flavorful and rich. 

We ordered appetizers and ramen. The server brought both at the same time. My better half sent his ramen back because he wanted to enjoy his octupus (which was delicious) first without the ramen getting cold. I wasn't in the mood to squabble with the server, so I just took everything. By the time my husband finished his octopus, I was done with my ramen. Since I was finished eating, he did not want to eat on his own. The server told him since he ordered the ramen, he would have to pay for it. The server offered to let him take it home, but ramen noodles sitting in the broth? How gross and mushy would that have been later? We told him we were not going to pay for it since we did not eat it. Their failure to pace the meal properly was not our fault. The owner/manager didn't even have the nerve to come tell us herself or even apologize.

Needless to say, we will never be back. It's a shame they lost a customer over $8."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday they were really packed so expect to wait a bit

Everything was good except our appetizers weren't hot at all and our chicken wing was raw so I had to ask the server if he could recook it... Instead of recooking it he argued that it was blood from the marrow of the chicken bone HELLO! The meat was pink and there was blood on the bone! So since I didn't wanna argue with him I just said forget it... That really set us off for the rest of the meal... Especially since we all work in the industry so we tend to let a lot of things go but this really just pissed us off... 

Sorry for the rant but still think everyone should at least try it for their freshly made noodles!"}
{"text":"Tampopo's ramen is pretty good!! Handmade in house and very delicious. Last time I got the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was delicious! Paying $1 for a marinated egg is so worth it to go with your ramen. The meat is also a great addition to their delicious broth. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because their restaurant desperately needs an upgrade! They have several small tables that seat 2, and then one giant table in the center with stools where they place everyone else, so you'll most likely be sitting right next to someone you didn't come with and there might be a wait depending what time you come. Nevertheless, I come for the food and at the very least you can take the noodles togo and get a similar amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner tonight and the place was packed.  After about 10 minutes, I got a seat at the counter and ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with Karaage.
Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago I was in Torrance CA (where Toyota and Honda both have their US headquarters) and had dinner at Izakaya Hachi where the tonkatsu for the shabu-shabu absolutely blew me away.  Thick, creamy, fatty, it coated everything that went in the pot.
The tonkatsu here, while better than almost anything to be found in Phoenix, simply didn't compare; nor did the karaage.
The noodles were very fresh but not as springy as one might expect; definitely a step below the hand pulled noodles at China Magic Noodle House in Mesa.  The pork was a little more well done than I would like, but the soft boiled egg was perfect.
All in all, a solid bowl of ramen, especially for Phoenix.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The spicy miso is the ramen of my dreams! I added pork belly and crunchy seaweed which I highly recommend. Service was helpful and attentive. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with high expectations and I'm bummed that this place was not what I was expecting.
First the place is really small and it felt crowded. 
I stared off with the Hirata bun which I was excited to try but it was a total fail. The bun was way to big for the amount of pork that was in it and I didn't like the piece of iceberg lettuce that was inside the bun. 
Then I ordered the Spicy Ramen. It definitely looks more spicier then it tastes. For paying $10 it would have been nice if I got more then 1 piece of meat in my ramen. It was all noodles, 1 egg and 1 meat. I didn't care to much for the noodles either.
I give this place 2 stars because our server was attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Glad to be here before the place's packed. The two star review was for the ramen which what this place is mostly known for and raved about. Ordered braised pork belly (kakuni) and octopus & wasabi (takowasabi) for apps which were good and tasty. For the main course, we ordered ultra spicy ramen, spicy miso ramen, chopped pork over rice (chasyu don) and Japanese fried chicken over rice (karaage don). Everything tasted good except for the ramen, both of them. They look super delicious, but the broth was very bland. I have had better tasting ramen in the valley than this place. Very disappointing, good thing we didn't have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Having lived in Osaka and experienced ramen on multiple occasions, this was the closest thing I have found to the authentic in country meal. Service was excellent as well. HIGHLY recommend for anyone wanting some misu or spicy misu ramen."}
{"text":"Service is great! Food is good as well! They serve fresh noodles with their ramen and make it, which is a plus because you don't want to eat those wrapped ramen noodles. I like their broth but I think they put too much green onions when I went so maybe slow down a little bit with the green onions because that's all I could taste. Overall experience was pleasant, the only downside is that the space is very small so be prepared to mingle and close with one another!"}
{"text":"Probably one of (if not) the best ramen in town. Highly recommended. If you're the kind of person who drinks the broth, the extra dollar for rich soup is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Mr Presidents - Coco Jumbo)

Ramens up, Ramens down
Have some sake for a round
Feed me well, feel my heart
And make me happy

Here we go getting food to some groove
Trying Ramen Noodles, how I sing as I eat
Cause that's what Bo Bites say, but I can improve
So turn it up again and watch me Yelp to the food

As we get close, you whisper coco
I hold you in my arms and you say, Jam Bo!
Scream and shout, turn and try Tampopo
Now you gotta go to Tampopo


Keeping it real, this is probably the closet solid Ramen joint in town for now!

I came here on a cold winter day.  The place is somewhat tiny so don't be surprised, but what I love about it is the bar top tables as you watch the chef cook and make your meal.  The community table is always a plus in my book!  I went for the Tonkotsu Ramen with some fish roe and a side of Octopus and Wasabi.  I also ordered a bottle of sake; cause what's Japanese food without sake!?

Overall, the octopus was what I'd expected it to be.  Slimy and with a bubbly pop and a hint of stinging wasabi.  The star of the night had to be the hand made Ramen noodles with the chewy and fatty pork, while the mushroom and egg helped mellow out the strong broth.  The roe I added helped gave it a salty taste.  

In the end, Tampopo Ramen has won my heart as the next hot spot for Ramen!  Until the next challenger comes along, guess you can catch me at Tampopo! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent Japanese ramen. More authentic than most places in town. Tasty takoyaki and gyoza. I wish they would give more broth, and the tonkotsu broth can use a little more seasoning. But overall, I like this place."}
{"text":"I like Tampopo, but it pales in comparison to a ramen joint I'd experienced in Chandler, as the broth didn't quite measure up to that fragrant, rich tonkotsu I was looking for.

It's neat that there are strips of bar and communal seating, and the chefs are visible as they prepare the noodles. Service was mediocre, as the waiters didn't seem to want to stop by and were always in a rush to leave. 

Tonkotsu ramen:
The noodles were a touch undercooked for me, and the broth was on the bland side. I did like the black garlic oil, and I ordered mentaiko on the side, which was nice with the broth. The pork wasn't anything special to me, and I could taste that it'd been prepared and refrigerated before serving (which is the norm I understand, as I've yet to come across a ramen place that didn't do this for preparation's sake). The egg was also rather overcooked and didn't have that soft runny center I love dipping noodles into. The bowl did come out piping hot, which I appreciate and never take for granted. 

Curry ramen:
I was surprised by how thick the curry here was, as other places I've had curry ramen usually have curry broth whereas here, it was thick curry similar to the kind served over rice. I didn't mind; I thought it was pretty good! Our waiter suggested pairing the spicy noodles with this curry, and I couldn't really tell the difference except that the noodles were a pinkish color. It's a nice option, but I don't think it makes too big of a difference. There were nice huge chunks of chashu here though, and I liked them better than the sliced version in the tonkotsu ramen.

Just a quick note that the tea here comes in cans, so unfortunately no complimentary refills. I may come back for a quick bite, and there's a Starbucks next door for a nice after-meal drink or dessert."}
{"text":"I love all types of ramen. That said, I have to give praise where praise is due. Tampopo's handmade noodles are on point. My family and I came here with a friend from out of town. We were seated quickly and given our menus (pro tip: come early, it is small and fills fast). My eyes were INSTANTLY drawn to the Ultra Spicy Ramen as I am a sucker for scorching foods. My wife, daughter and friend went with the more normal tonkotsu and seafood ramen respectively. 

The food came quickly and my wife's soup was amazing. It had rich pork flavor and plenty of noodles. It was, however, a little light on actual pork. My friend loved his seafood ramen as well (I couldn't try as I am very allergic to shellfish). Even my 2 year old daughter devoured her portion of my wife's bowl.

My ramen, however, was a disappointment. Yes, it was spicy (not as much as they proclaim in my opinion) and yes it has the fixings. My issue was the flavor and texture of the broth. It had almost no flavor, just burn. I've eaten numerous items which are delicious but also a ring burner. This wasn't like that at all. The texture of the broth isn't like a nice soup like the other broths nor is it thick but delectable like a stew (or even hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant). Oh no, it had the texture of mud. This thick, brown and red, mud. It was very, very unappetizing. It didn't work with the comically large spoon you are given nor the chopsticks (the broth makes it nearly impossible to grasp the noodles). I was able to make my way through the noodles but will not be having it again. 

Tampopo gets 4 stars as everyone else's food was amazing and I'll come back for a normal bowl of ramen soon. But man, I can't recommend the ultra spicy ramen to anyone. Blech."}
{"text":"New ramen restaurant in Phoenix! I saw one of yelper's checkin a few days ago and couldn't wait to try here for myself.

Grand opening was Monday 11/2, so still new here. Looking at menu, I thought they really researched Phoenix market by adding several spicy options

I was in search of authentic Hakata ramen, so I stayed with basic Hakata ramen with my noodle al-dente, just like true Hakata style.

Ramen came with kikurage (can't remember English name) but dark seaweed looking one on the picture I posted. Very authentic. Soft boiled egg was warm and flavorful. 

Unfortunately they put too much black paper on my soup and couldn't really enjoy the broth. I add black pepper only to Sapparo ramen. Hakata ramen goes well with sesame. 

I also ordered side of gyoza. Gyoza tasted very authentic, and I enjoyed them well.

Service was not there yet. Considering they just opened, I thought it wasn't fair to say anything yet.

Next time when I come back, I will ask them not to add any black pepper in my soup, and pay small extra to add more flavor to my soup. Let's see how that gets close to what I am used to eat every time I visit Fukuoka."}
{"text":"This little spot has been bookmarked and on my mind for some time and was glad to finally try it. My family and I arrived mid afternoon which was nice given we were able to get seated immediately which I have read is not always the case. The joint as many have mentioned is on the small side but staff seemed to work the problem well and get people in and out swiftly. Staff were very outgoing and answered many of our dumb questions with a smile. 

For the starter, we all tried out the hirata buns. The little guys were very yummy and the sauce really carried the dish. As for the entree, I went with tonkotsu ramen with the added topping of mentaiko. The broth was flavorful and all components flowed well together. The egg was just perfect with the dish and wish I would have added an extra. My wife and daughter loved their ramen as well and preferred rich sauce. I personally prefer standard broth. I did like my wife's spicy side to her dish though. I had grand plans of asking for extra noodles when mine ran out but I was just too full. Who would think ramen could be so filling? Overall, a good meal/experience that I would do again. 

Just an FYI, keep an eye on all your additions as then can jump out at you come bill time. Little pricey if you do not stick to the basics."}
{"text":"I had to try it out cuz you know... it says ramen expert on my profile. From Japan to California to Tempe, I am here to see who makes good ramen! I was super excited about this ramen place because everything looked like a ramen place in California. Just from the pictures I have seen, it looked more authentic than all of the ramen places in Arizona... including Fujiya Market.

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen without the extra flavor. The broth was not as thick or creamy as I expected. That is really the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars (and the fact that the waitress forgot my order... twice). It was the criteria that would have matched it with the awesome ramen shops in California and Japan. Next, it was trying it with the extra flavor that costs an extra dollar. And to my disappointment, it didn't really had any depth to it. It just tasted like it had more sodium in the broth. Although, I do recommend the extra flavor because the regular flavor was kind of weak since it's missing the flavor from the creamy and thick texture and the pork fat that's supposed to be floating on top of a tonkatsu broth.

No doubt, the ramen is still better than Umami and the forsaken place called Ramen Republic. I think Posh in Scottsdale is a little better but it's way more expensive. So I think Tampopo is a good compromise on flavor vs price with the available options here in AZ.

On a final note, THE TAKOYAKI IS AWESOME! Tastes good, authentic and full of actual octopus. Just like the ones in Japan and California. I was pleasantly surprised. It beats the ones being served at the Japanese Matsuri that were more expensive and had octopus \"paste\" in it.

I just might come here for the takoyaki instead of the ramen. Tampopo... your takoyaki destination. LOL"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a bunch of friends over the weekend and I wasn't impressed.  The service was pretty terrible, it was busy and their were only 2 waitresses.  The waitress with the short hair wasn't very attentive and lacked follow through. I would understand if she was consistently on the move waiting on tables but she wasn't.  


I ordered the spicy ramen with the spicy noodles and it was pretty good.  The pork in the ramen was the best I've had in AZ.  My husband ordered Ton Katsu ramen and complained that the broth was bland.  The table behind us also felt the same way about their broth. 
I also ordered the grilled squid legs which was absolutely disgusting! Also the the size of the squid legs were only 2-3 inches long. 

Although the pork and noodles are awesome, I will not be returning.  I rather have ramen at Fujiya Market or Sushj Ken."}
{"text":"Tasty hot and fresh! Quick service and large portion. The crispy pork upgrade is a must with the ramen bowl. Only request is to have an IPA beer available."}
{"text":"Really bad. Seafood ramen has no flavor and is full of overcooked, rubbery seafood. The shrimp were not deveined. One waiter for like 30 people. Slow. Shitty atmosphere. Cramped. Noodle House downtown Phx is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Best ramen we have had in AZ. Always good. Always quick. Anytime we want ramen this is the place to go and it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I know I know, it's unfair that I come from a place where ramen is really damn good.... 

We were on a 2 and a half day trip to Phoenix and after eating nothing but western food, I was craving Asian food. We had already been to Phoenix, Scottsdale and Sedona so we decided to give Tempe a try and was so excited to see ramen. 

To get this out of the way,I did not come in here expecting great ramen.... 

The tonkotsu broth really needed more flavor... Pork flavor. I can forgive not having that great froth that comes with tonkotsu ramen, but this just tasted like powder and water and maybe some soy sauce. Not all bad though...The broth was hot which was great and the thin noodles were cooked to a firm texture. My egg was surprisingly close to perfect and the wood ear mushrooms and bean sprouts were appreciated. Pork was on the tougher side...

The bun was my least favorite thing. Bun to meat ratio was off and the sauce was sooo salty

Overall it met my expectations but if you're used to getting good Cali Ramen or legit Ramen from Japan, this place will do you dirty"}
{"text":"Good homemade ramen, can never complain except that the parking and seating here stinks. 

Had the Spicy Miso Ramen, the broth had a good tender taste, the noodles itself tasted handmade not like package ramen, and the soft boil eggs are always good here. 

J out."}
{"text":"Miso Ramen is so good the broth has great flavor and the corn completes the dish. Definitely a new spot we will be frequenting"}
{"text":"God... I've been such a hater of this place (see last mediocre review below). Like such a hater. Anyone who even mentions Tampopo in my presence and you could hear my scoff from a mile away. BUT recently I went back and I am SO happy to be proven wrong! Their tonkotsu ramen is so much better than I remembered! I also got it with the rich broth this time, which I didn't remember them having last time, because I definitely would have added it on!  My boyfriend got the ultra spicy ramen and I didn't think it was as good as the tonkotsu. Their chili paste made the broth too thick to really sip on and it was super salty. I think you're better off ordering a regular ramen and adding chili oil if you are craving something spicy. We also got the gyoza and kaarage. The yuzu salt with kaarage was a nice touch but didn't really add anything imo. I'd rather eat fried chicken with ketchup"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I love the food! The people are great! The whole experience makes the small space worth it."}
{"text":"As someone with not very much experience with Ramen but likes to try new places I would say probably not the place for you to go. The miso ramen was better than with the black fungus one. Forgot what it is called, but I was scared of the fungus. Also we got the steamed pork bun, not what we expected. Honestly we are all about Ramen Republic, maybe we like \"trashy\" ramen, but its consistent and yummy."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, some of the best ramen we've got around! Lots of people are saying it's not authentic, which might be the case, but as far as Phoenix goes, I'm so happy this place exists. I got the spicy miso and was pleasantly surprised. The pork belly appetizer is also fantastic."}
{"text":"visited with my sister and this is gonna be our new favorite ramen place  everything was perfect except for rice. the rice tasted like thai rice. i prefer japanese sticky rice personally. we'll def visit again"}
{"text":"Tried this place after my favorite ramen place closed down for good. Came here after seeing it had good reviews. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which is their basic ramen dish. It comes with a slice of roastex pork, blackwood fungus, garlic oil, bean sprouts, 1/2 seasoned  hard boiled egg, scallions, & sesame. You can add extras like cod roe, pork belly, and bean sprouts. You can also ask for rich broth which is a much thicker stock. I ordered the rich broth but felt it was much too thick. Next time I'd do without it. 

Also ordered a small squid salad as a starter which was good and a side dish called grilled squid and tentacles which was delicious. I'd order both of these again."}
{"text":"The Ramen was tasty, I had the curry ramen which was mostly noodles which I liked. The atmosphere was very cramped. So basically thumbs up for the ramen and thumbs down for atmosphere. The atmosphere reminded me of a quick stop place for a college kids to get grub.
Wanna go grab some quick good tasting ramen, it is an alright place to go, want to enjoy the evening or atmosphere pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"They were really busy, but worth the wait. Incredible fresh ramen, and the hakata thin noodles are fantastic. I recommend the tampopo salad, if you haven't had fresh octopus, that's the way to go."}
{"text":"Food- one of my favorite ramen places. I always order the miso ramen and add extra pork. Oh so good.

Time- very quick service.... normally stop in around lunch time and can be in and out in 30mins."}
{"text":"My daughter & son in law just moved into town and she wanted to go get some ramen, so after some great word of mouth from fellow friends I suggested we head on over to Tampopo Ramen, so off we went.

After checking out the menu, I went with a Spicy Miso Ramen, it had pork, bean sprouts, hardboiled egg, and scallions and spices. The broth had good flavor, and the noodles where perfectly cook, it just wasn't spicy like I had hoped it to be.

Service was good and friendly, we sat at the bar and watched everything be cooked, our bowls of ramen did sit there for a few before being served, thought about getting it myself, but resisted. Even though it sat, it was still very hot when it came to us.

If you are in the mood for ramen, this is one of the better ones I have found in the valley, swing by and give them a try, they are always busy, but the wait isn't that bad."}
{"text":"We had a group of 11 on a Saturday.  It was packed to the gills there.  We sat in the middle table of the entire place.  The service was terrible.  The server had to take our order twice, because they ran out of regular ramen and he did not remember what we ordered.  Getting refills was tough too.  Waving down your server.  The wait for the food was a little longer than normal.  The gyoza was good.  I had to change my order from ramen to a rice bowl.  Got the chicken.  It was ok.  I know it was new had still working through kinks.  The owner return all of our money on our credit cards, he did not have to do that.  I will def be back with less friends.  LOL!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best ramen place I've been to in Arizona thus far! I've tried a few and none of which I was satisfied. But this one, I had to come back for seconds the next day! I really like their spicy miso ramen. Their pork was really good and juicy. Can't wait to eat it again!"}
{"text":"Really small place. I had the spicy ramen which was too salty, and my friend ordered the tonkatsu ramen which was lukewarm and not hot enough at all. =( I'm missing the hype people are talking about."}
{"text":"Tampopo ramen was good, however for my son he prefers RR but didn't think it was bad, but he's 10 so take that with a grain of salt. I thought it was delicious it is small and maybe not the most attentive service but it reminds me of all the other really good ramen places I've eaten at. 
Next visit is ultra spicy and get the concentrated broth it is worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced,skimpy & bland rice bowls!
If you are looking for a poorly executed menu with dishes with identity crises, this is the place to try!
The 2 stars are solely for the service!"}
{"text":"I frequent ramen places a lot and this one is one of the best. The quality was great! It was sooo busy, but service was top priority. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone. The ramen was top quality."}
{"text":"Expensive. Not enough options for non pork eaters and costs an arm and a leg for chicken and then when you pay that outrageous price you get 3 pieces of chicken? Not to mention my friends who got pork received one price of pork. Portions are so small for the money.


I would like to note the curry rice dish is great value for food but could still use bigger quantity."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Ramen in Tempe quit wasting your time and go here. Good price points and awesome food, my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Dooooo itttt.

Positives: 
First off, my husband has been wanting to eat here for forever and I kept putting it off. I was not expecting it to be great at all. I was unhappy about going here, but went for him. However after I took my first bite of the Hirata Buns appetizer I quickly realized how VERY VERY wrong I was! It was packed full of flavor.. Seriously tasty. I must have said how good it was every other bite. 

I ordered the spicy miso ramen with the extra $1 for the \"rich soup\".  I took a bite and I couldn't believe the amazing flavorful goodness.  It took a few minutes to figure out how to eat the ramen with the chopsticks and the sauce with the big wooden spoon. (Had I known my lack of skills I would have wore a black shirt, I had spicy ramen splatter all over me) My egg was cooked to a perfect gooey perfection. I got everything that came with it and only added the rich sauce. 

My hubby didn't get the rich soup and preferred it, however myself and my daughter added the rich soup and I MUCH preferred it!!!! It really packs the flavor in. I tried all 3 of ours and the spicy was the best! It is not very spicy at all so don't let that deter you! The Hirata Buns are a MUST. 

The staff was very friendly and chatted a bit as we are at the bar. We had a lovely visit. 

Negatives:
None."}
{"text":"First time I've ever had authentic ramen...was recommended this by a friend who would not stop raving about the kakuni the entire time. We get there, cute little spot right by my old high school. Very comforting. I chose the seafood ramen with kakuni. Changed my life. Best ramen I've ever had so far, I've been back 4 times to get the same thing, worth every trip and dollar. A must !"}
{"text":"Their ultra spicy ramen is really good, but havn't tried other menu items yet. 
Chairs are a little uncomfortable but that's not really a problem for me since i take it to-go 90% of the time."}
{"text":"The place was very crowded when we arrived a little after 6:30 on a Saturday evening. Fortunately we got seated right away but a long line formed immediately after we sat. We came here because some friends highly recommended this place. 

We started with Karaage and Takoyaki.  We then ordered seafood ramen, miso ramen and tonkatsu ramen.  

The service was good. The noodles were excellent.  The broth was good but not fantastic.  It lacks the richness and deep flavor that makes good ramen so good.  The Tonkatsu ramen was saved because we ordered an extra kakuni the braised pork bellie for $3. This was excellent.  The chashu that came with the ramen was lack luster.  The Karaage at $7 was not a great deal.  Takoyaki was excellent and the dancing Bonita flakes caught the attention of all the people sitting near us. 

Considering this is Arizona and ramen options not at the level of Southern California, Las Vegas or Austin, I gave it 4 stars because it is a legit ramen joint. 

The bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given a 0 star. The service was absolutely horrid. And the soup well? Was most likely Crisco melted down with spaghetti noodles in it.
Stay away."}
{"text":"I have lived a fair number of years in Japan during my life and I have to say Ramen will forever be engrained in me, I can never turn down a bowl. That said Tampopo Ramen does come close enough to satisfy my cravings from back east. Their Miso broth is quite nice and the noodles are okay, something about the firmness of the noodles seem off to me. The pork was nice but it was just a seared cutlet that honestly did not have much going on, but it was a nice filling cut either way, they don't skimp out on the ingredients here."}
{"text":"To start off this place has only been open for about a month. The layout is very much like a traditional ramen shop in that its pretty small and has lots of bar seating. They don't take reservations and the place is pretty small so its not great for large groups.

I read reviews on Yelp before going so I expected the service to be kinda iffy. When we first walked in on a Saturday night we weren't greeted by anyone so we just stood around for awhile. There were empty seats but other people were waiting by the door too. We had a group of 10 and the waiter was quite exasperated by that when we told him. We were split up into 3 groups but eventually seated ourselves together at the bar. The service is incredibly disorganized. They have 3 people serving the entire restaurant which since its so small should be enough. For some reason they were super ovewhelmed and kept messing up our orders and forgetting things. We had to grab our own menus and napkins and didn't receive water until the food arrived. To their credit the servers were very nice and very apologetic about the wait and all the messups. 

Onto the food...we ordered a couple Harata buns, takoyaki, and variety of ramen. The Harata buns are pretty much a piece of pure pork fat inside a wilted piece of lettuce inside a bun covered with spicy mayo sauce. I would definitely not recommend them. The takoyaki was decent but nothing special. The ramen noodles were actually pretty good. Definitely better than the other ramen places around here like Dozo and Cherryblossom. The broth however was disappointing. I got the rich broth add-on and found that it was weaker and watery compared to the normal broths at the ramen places in California. I tried the regular tonkatsu broth which was even more watery so I was glad I chose the rich broth. The broths were salty but not very rich. I liked that you have the option for extra noodles and extra toppings because the other ramen places around here don't offer that. 

Overall I think I would come back to try this place again but not anytime soon. I'll probably wait a couple months or a year until they teach their servers how to be more efficient or hire more and maybe make adjustments to the broth. For now I'll probably stick to Dozo Izakaya to get my ramen fix."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place because they made their own noodles. But after ordering the spicy miso ramen the flavor was a bit off. Waiter service was lacking, on refills."}
{"text":"This was ok. I had the chicken teriyaki over rice.  This was nothing I couldn't make at home.  We did have the ramen pork. This was very good. The noodles were fantastic.  I do wish they would have charred the shashito peppers.  They were served practically raw. Maybe a little lime would be good too."}
{"text":"I got the spicy miso ramen and added corn. Went on a weekday around 12:30 pm and didn't have to wait to sit. Service was fast and courteous. I liked the ambience; the place might seem small to some people but I think it's great to see the cooks right by you, just like you'd see at a sushi restaurant. The ramen was good, no complaints, and I would certainly go again. Different from ramen you'd get at Republic, better in certain ways."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally through the years to meet up with friends in the area or at a neutral ground in the valley, and the service has been a 50/50 every time I come that it makes me feel like I'm at the casino. For example, I came here with my husband about a year ago, and the service was fast, friendly and efficient. Tonight, my husband decided to get me take-out because it would be good to have some soup while nursing an on-coming sickness, so he came in around 8:00pm. He placed his order and then he waited. In the time he waited, another person came up, placed their to-go order and left. My husband was wondering what was so complicated about our order of two Ultra Spicy Ramen that was causing the delay. At around 8:42pm, they asked him what he was waiting around for, and he had to remind them that he was waiting for his order. He was a bit outraged because there really wasn't an apology or an offer to give him something for the mix-up.

The food is better than your average ramen place like Ramen Republic or the Sobas where they make the noodles in house, but I wouldn't put it above Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in flavor of broth and authenticity of Japanese ramen.

Overall, I would say that the place is good if you're looking for a decent bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Great traditional ramen, in a modern restaurant environment. Pork was...amazing. They make their own noodles in house. I like egg noodle more (personal opinion). Great place with friendly staff. Be ready to be greeted upon walking in!"}
{"text":"Tried the seafood ramen, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS !!!
12$ for:
- 3 small shrimps heads-on, getting my hands burned and dirty trying to clean them off.
- 3 very small fish pieces, not identified, and tasting like a 1 month old frozen fish (i can buy better fish at any grocery store)
- a broth tasteless
- Nothing else beside noodles
Very disappointed, I am not going to come back again, better go to republic ramen"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd pay for ramen. I didn't know how delicious fresh ramen was. The dining experience is very intimate- usually pretty jam packed to one another and you cozy up to your neighbors whether you know them or not. The food is delicious and I recommend to anyone even those who aren't normally soup people."}
{"text":"Great place!  Great food, kind of casual.  Staff is nice and everyone I know who eats there likes it."}
{"text":"It was only a matter of time until we received our own neighborhood Ramen joint. It's an enjoyable communal atmosphere with lots of people packed in busily chatting and eating ramen. They even have a counter for sitting, eating, and watching the chefs, just like in NY or LA. The food is very good, but we only gave 4 stars because the portions are small."}
{"text":"Busy, buzzing and friendly. Fun music. Not a date place unless you're 20. Very small, college atmosphere. 
Took my kid. He liked it. I however don't have the palate for the ramen soup unfortunately. So 5 stars because I can't fault them on my personal taste. Wouldn't be fair.
Attentive staff. Might take my kid, but not for me."}
{"text":"Love taking my friends here! Not gonna lie, was not excited about going somewhere to get ramen. But tampopo is amazing and I refuse to eat anything besides tampopo. They have great appetizers too! I get the miso ramen it is amazing. You can get a vegetarian version as well. It is a small place and you can't make reservations. Around 740 on the weekend you can't even walk inside. It is well worth the wait and people definitely do!"}
{"text":"The most authentic ramen I have had yet! The staff is always very friendly. Very small location and sometimes the seating sucks but the spicy miso ramen is totally worth it!! :)"}
{"text":"A quick update here. I've been to this restaurant 10 + times with no real trouble. Today I went back for the first time in about two months. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen, which I usually get. The pork was really overcooked to the point of being charred all around, the broth was lacking flavor, and the bean sprouts were noticeably old. There's a lot of new people working in there too. I'm really really disappointed in the experience. 

One other thing that's been inconsistent with every visit. On the menu for the ramen bowls, it clearly says \"slices\" of pork. You get just one slice, every time, in every bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent. Super friendly prompt service, knowledgeable wait staff, amazing ramen, the braised pork is ridiculous, and they even accomedated my weird low carb diet but subbing noodles for extra bean sprouts. Got extra add in of course. Really enjoyed the spicy Miso base and the shishito peppers. Another thing that too many great places get horribly wrong, the music, the music at tampopo was excellent, artic monkeys, modest mouse, Franz Ferdinand, etc. Will be back here alot."}
{"text":"I had the Ultra Spicy Ramen with the spicy noodles. I love spicy. This is not spicy for me but it is still really good. It made my nose run which is good but not enough for me to say it's spicy. That probably doesn't make any sense but if you have a high spicy tolerance, you'll understand. The meat is very good, I added an extra portion of pork belly. I think they could cut back just a little bit on the large onion slices and bean sprouts but overall, noms."}
{"text":"I love that they make their Ramen fresh. Super trendy and clean. I wish their chicken teriyaki was white meat not dark but the teriyaki sauce was awesome. Some of the best I've had. The Ramen was good but not the best. All-in-all worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pretty legit for AZ ramen. 

The tonkotsu broth wasn't as rich as other ramens I've had (like in Cali) but it was still quite flavorful. The noodles had a nice, chewy texture and the garlic oil added a little extra kick. The pork belly slice had just the right amount of char; you can see them cook it with a blowtorch behind the bar! Try the tonkoktsu with added sweet corn and bamboo shoots to up the level of the taste! 

We also tried the steam buns and they were tasty, but nothing exceptional. The sauce and pork belly (same meat as in the tonkotsu) made a great pair,  but the meat to bun ratio was a little off - too much bun, not enough meat. 

The menu is small and fairly limited - not much else offered aside from ramen and standard Japanese apps (takoyaki, gyoza, etc). 

This is a small space and always fills up around standard mealtimes. Seats at the bar and tables. Better for smaller groups given the limited space. 

Service is prompt and efficient, pretty friendly but don't expect them to hover. Someone checked on us once after we got our food  and that was it, which is fine given how busy this place usually is. 

TL;DR
- Food - solid 4/5
- Service - can't complain
- small interior
- limited menu"}
{"text":"I was sipping on my water when I felt a small curly hair on my tongue. Pointed it out to the waitress and she was very apologetic and gave us a free dessert (green tea ice cream with pocky sticks). No complaints!

*DISCLAIMER: I fully admit I'm not a ramen connoisseur.* I had the tonkotsu ramen and it wasn't bad at all. I understand every restaurant's recipe is different, but all the tonkotsu ramen I've had in the past (couple different restaurants) had a creamy taste and this one was just heavy on the pork flavor. Not bad, it's just not what I'm into.

I love that they offer to give you another 'round' of noodles for just 2 bucks because I love noodles!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been more mortified to eat what I did in this restaurant. Typically whenever you order something with seafood in it, it's gutted, sliced, etc. I ordered the seafood Ramen and there was no mention that there would be the entire shrimp in my food, legs and eyes. I nearly threw up. When I asked to take it back, and behead the shrimp and take the arms off, the cook refused. My friend had to do it for me. My friends meal, according to him, was good but I don't think I'll be coming back here. Don't get me wrong, the staff was polite and attentive, but I'd rather not cry again because I was served something that was still staring at me in the face."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Excellent take out too. The flavor of the ultra spicy is just perfect with rich broth."}
{"text":"Started w the Hirata buns (or rather a few bites of my friends' buns since I don't love buns). Taste was pretty good! I found the bun itself tooo doughy though - def could use some work on texture.

Now for the ramen (3 types):
Noodles, good - just the right amount of firmness. 
Egg, great! - nice and gooey inside 
Broth, tonkotsu all the way. I tried the spicy miso and miso, and all my friends and I agreed tonkotsu was the best of the broths. 
Pork belly, meh (confirmed after I ate mine and my friend's miso pork belly - wow, do I eat a lot....). I liked the extra crispy edges but the insides were lackluster for me. I also personally like a thinner pork belly.

Overall, the meal was enjoyable, but I don't feel any particular desire to rush back here and try more items over exploring other places around my new home!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome spot!  Smaller place with a long communal table and a bar top to watch the chefs do their ramen thing! Has a fun authentic feel to the place. 

I ordered the Ultra Spicy Ramen - add tofu and bamboo.  
The broth is SO flavorful.  The spice level was perfect for me.  I am not a big pork eater but I will say this pork melted in my mouth. 

I will say this is a lot of food so come hungry!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! ! I love Sue and Charlie!  Sweet family owned place!! Great talent behind the scenes!!! 
Fresh noodles daily! 
We go here twice a week!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen restaurant in Arizona. The pork is cooked really well and complements the ramen well. The restaurant is really small and tight but it's not too bad with small parties."}
{"text":"Words can't describe how much I love this food!!! Best ramen I've ever had, I could just cry"}
{"text":"The ramen was great but the tofu was still cold when it came out even though it was deep fried. I think it was just a one time incident."}
{"text":"Ramen pretty good! Gonna go try some other flavor next time. We were recommended, they are good! But not like super amazing. Everything is ok."}
{"text":"Great authentic atmosphere.  It felt as if I was in a small ramen shop packed in San Fran.  Service is less than personable, but that made it even more authentic to me.  The spicy miso ramen was deliciousness! I like that it came with an egg (some places charge extra for that) and they had authentic wooden spoons.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. My family and I will definitely be dinning here again."}
{"text":"The ramen was pretty good. I've had better at other ramen restaurants. The location was small but there wasn't a wait to get seated. A few Japanese beers available as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior! Very friendly and professional staff. Their diverse menu is particularly enjoyable, especially in the soda and dessert arena. I tried their curry ramen and it's to die for. The extra ramen I ordered was a bit clumped together, but I won't hold that against them. My sister really enjoyed the way they cooked their boiled duck eggs."}
{"text":"I've looked all over for a place that serves awesome ramen and this place succeeded all my expectations. I got spicy ramen with spicy noodles and Im in love. Would eat here everyday if I could. Prices were reasonable, and I really loved that you could sit at the bar and watch them make it. Authentic and tasty. Go try it!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny spot next to a Starbucks but the food keeps the place full especially on a Friday night. Be prepared to wait a little. Once seated and ordered, the food arrived at a decent amount of time. We ordered the spicy miso ramen with the rich soup upgrade. The kids got the extra fried chicken. We also ordered gyoza and tofu. Everything we ordered was delicious. To top it all off, they had Asahi on draft. Worth the wait and definitely deserves a return trip."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly.  We ordered the miso ramen. Everything is very fresh and delicious.  They make their noodles every morning! The only downside is this place is kinda small. So it's awkward for big parties."}
{"text":"I might be in the minority, but the ramen here just isn't really up my alley. Because the seating is very limited, the restaurant is always crowded. After trying the tonkotsu ramen, I think that the noodles are too thin (reminiscent of angel hair pasta) and chasu has too much of a smoky flavor. However, the broth is decent. At the price point of around $11, I would definitely choose Nishikawa Ramen (Chandler) or even Ramen Dozo (Tempe) over this place."}
{"text":"Great place i stumbled upon by accident. Pretty much addicted to this place now. Truly authentic and the guys are passionate about it. If you're in the mood for ramen look no further, if you're in the area its a must try spot. Haven't had one thing bad or questionable."}
{"text":"Spicy miso was great for a light dinner. Asked for extra soft boiled egg and it was just great. Really small place but who cares if the food is good!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for an Arizona restaurant! As a person who's eaten a good amount of tasty ramen, I was super excited when my buddies told me about this place. Atmosphere is pretty solid, however seating is a bit tight, especially when busy. Ordered the Takoyaki and the Miso Ramen from the menu. Their broth is pretty solid, reminding me of flavors I got from Little Tokyo whenever I make my trip out to California, clean broth, tasty but not too potent. The Takoyaki was on point, the seasoning and sauce tasted perfect and they give a good portion of octopus in it as well. Overall I really enjoyed this place and as of now, this is probably the best ramen shop in the east valley, beating out Umami and Republic Ramen. While it isn't a Little Tokyo ramen shop, this will do just fine to get your fix."}
{"text":"Lived in Asia 10 years, love Tonkatsu ramen. Like a lot of people in the comments here, I've had a hard time finding it as a resident of Phoenix. Plenty of places in LA and have even found it in Vegas, but having tried a couple of the PHX places people mention in this comment section, I haven't found a place I'd go back to a second time. Tampopo is the best ramen house in the Phoenix area, safe to say that, but would I make the trip from Glendale to Tempe for it again? Nope. Have seen some complaints on here about the noodles, the egg, the service...I'm not too picky about that, but what I need is a real Tonkatsu style, deep tasting broth. This place doesn't have it, even though I got the extra deep $1 add. The pork also left something to be desired, but I don't eat ramen for the pork, so not a huge issue. I wonder if part of what's going on in Phoenix is that restaurants are trying to appeal to a wider audience, so they dumb down the broth. It doesn't make sense that there wouldn't be at least one adequate bowl of ramen to be found here. I'll keep trying to find it though...."}
{"text":"The place is small, mainly bar style seating, only abt 3 tables; of which one can sit 4 people, and it fills up quickly.  The food was good, we order a few appetizers.  Unless they change their vendor for chicken wings, I wouldn't order them.  They were over cooked, with very little meat, but they were crispy and seasoned well.  The gyoza were good.  I opted for the Ultra Spicy Ramen and added pork belly and spicy fish roe.  For me it wasn't spicy, but the others that tried it, it was spicy.  The broth is a heavier pork broth, great for when and if it gets cold out here.  But it was good."}
{"text":"Coming from cali, there are numerous ramen joints where staff greets you enthusiastically  in unison. Where you know despite the language barrier you're getting something worth the 30 min plus wait...THIS was not one of those places. The prices were decent, cheaper than even some of the pho spots we've been to in az, which was a first for us but even then we were in agreement this would probably be our last visit here. 

The ramen looked like ramen, it smelled like ramen but there were so many things missing. We had such high hopes, but the broth was incredibly sweet, sweeter than any ramen I've ever had. And didn't have for a lack of a better word, the creaminess that tonkotsu broth often has. Another one off the list for our search for good ramen in az..."}
{"text":"Went for the first time having extremely high expectations. I ordered fried chicken on rice, which was disappointing. The pieces were small, and there was no seasoning or sauce to save the dry taste. It was just.....plain rice with chicken so it was at the most underwhelming. The miso ramen was just subpar. Maybe we ordered the wrong things...maybe our next visit will be better."}
{"text":"My second time getting take out.  The first time was good.  Had the tonkatsu ramen and I was surprised it had three slices of pork!  Thumbs up.  This time i got the miso ramen and it had one slice of pork and they didn't put the egg in.  Very disappointing and inconsistent.  Some of the noodles were also stuck together.  I also had the karaage which came with a dipping salt.  The karaage was good but battered rather than a starch coating like other karaage."}
{"text":"First time visit, was welcomed with a loud \"MOSHI MOSHI\" from behind the bar, so far so good. Reminded me of a small shop in Tokyo. All broths based on Tonkotsu base, which is a pork based broth and in my opinion the best there is. Noodles are made in house daily. There are spicy and regular. I recommend getting the Pork Belly along with your Ramen and sitting at the bar, as the cooks were very friendly. Excited to see where this place goes in the future."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I have ever had! 
We go to this one all the time even though it's an hour away from us. 
I always get the miso ramen with no seaweed and my husband always gets the spicy miso ramen."}
{"text":"As a traveled chef, this as close to the best ramen you can get without buying a plane ticket. It's a hole in the wall BUT where else will you see someone making fresh noodles? I've been to almost every ramen joint in town and this place take the cake. Spice and seasonings are on point here.I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This may be 4 stars, but this is the best Ramen place in Arizona/Phoenix. It's a small and hip little joint. The servers were really nice but they didn't check up on us a lot.

As for the food, I ordered the ultra spicy and my sister had the Tonkotsu. The broths were just fabulous although the ultra spicy is really just medium. I added more chili oil though which was awesome. The noodles are also delicious as well as all the other fixins. 

The reason why I give this four stars and not 5 is because my Ramen came with one piece of pork. To add another would have been $3 and the pork is not that good. They also didn't let me sub pork belly for the roasted pork which sucked because I love Ramen places that are very accommodating to your taste. The egg also lacked flavor and was not runny at all which is a major bummer. Overall, for being $10 for the ultra spicy and $8 for the Tonkotsu, it's not a bad place to go, and considering the broth is the best I've had in Arizona, I will be back."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible.  The Ramen was pretty good.  I just left frustrated with poor seating, inattentive service, I had to track down a waitress to get my bill, forget the refills.  We asked for an extra bowl, but they were both so dirty we couldn't use them.  Never once did the waitress come back to check if we needed anything or how it turned out."}
{"text":"This is most likely one of the best Asian restaurants in The whole state of Arizona, the food was amazingly tasteful and the great service was just what I needed. What really made the meal was the nice server by the name of Ryan who was Polite, and funny. To sum it all up I highly recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"On point is seemingly all I need to say.  It does get busy here so if you're first world stressing about waiting then go to the Starbucks next door and get your mocha latte whatever to help you de-stress.  But seriously this place rocks.  Quick friendly service from all the service staff there.  Writing reviews for me is based on multiple experiences and this place has me as a regular.  I visit 2-3 times per week not because its convenient but for the fact that I can run into, crush some house made broth,ramen and other goodness then peace out feeling satiated.  The portion size is spot on along with the overall feel for the restaurant welcoming and space warp to japan noodle shops.  After returning from Japan I feel they captured that trend and overall have a loyal customer as they've always maintained the consistency since I've been going."}
{"text":"I came into Tampopo wanting to love it, but sadly I can't say that I walked away loving it. So let's start from the begining, this place is pretty small. Which isn't too much of a problem but it did make it a bit uncomfortable. 

And then there was the food! As I said before I came in wanting to love it. I'll admit my expectations may have been high but after seeing the pictures on Yelp and reading some reviews I believe it was justified. I got the seafood ramen and let me say it looked good. As soon as I got it I dug in. The soup was rich, the noodles were good (not overcooked and soggy), and the seafood was cooked pretty well. My first few bites were superb, but the more I ate the less satisfying it became. And in the end there was another unavoidable fact. The servings were fairly small :(. I have to sadly report I walked out less than satisfied. 

And lastly the cost. For what u got I feel like it was a bit expensive for not enough food. I think the quality was good enough but in the end it just wasn't satisfying. 

Given this if someone I was with wanted to go there I would probably go with them but I don't think I'd go by myself."}
{"text":"Spicy miso w/pork belly...phenomenal. Decent beer & sake offering as well. Service can be spotty when busy, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I got hooked on Ramen in NYC during a recent trip.  I began looking for something comparable in the Mesa area.  Well, I found this place in Tempe.  It was perfect. 

I ordered the Miso.  I added the thick broth. It was so rich and tasty.  This is a must. 

The bonus: after eating the noodles, for 2.00, you can recharge your bowl with more noodles.  Bam!  Now I have lunch tomorrow.  By the way: I refilled with the spicy noodles.  Again, so good.  Perfect combination.

I will surely be back with more friends.  The place is small; so it would not be good for a large group. But take your bestie and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Having never tried ramen in a restaurant before I must say it was much better than what I expected.  Full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice in my meal.  I'll go back thanks to the good food, great prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place I have tired the pork buns which are delious along with with curry which is not very spicy which I love and had great flavor.  The toppings were  perfect combination of salt, crunchy,  and savory. The place is small but the service is quick and they are able custom anything you want. Since its small they get packed quickly so expect to wait and it's a community table so I hope your up for random conversation unless you sit at the bar and you can see everything getting made. They do have a spicy ramen which I would not touch as it as flaming red but the guy sweating next to me said he enjoyed it ."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Tampopo based on the reviews, but after multiple visits I ultimately found that it didn't quite live up to the hype. 

The first time I went over a year ago I had the ultra spicy ramen. The broth was bright red so I figured it probably had a nice kick to it, but I personally didn't find it very spicy at all. The roast pork wasn't bad and the noodles had good texture. 

The next few times I went I tried the miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, and tonkotsu ramen. The roast pork and ramen noodles remained consistent, but I found the broth pretty bland.

Overall not my favorite ramen spot in the area. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait and it gets pretty cramped at times. I also found hair in my takoyaki one time so that was fun."}
{"text":"Authentic ramen in a modern setting. We watched the owner making the noodles, which he makes fresh daily. Definitely my new favorite ramen in the valley. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The best Japanese Ramen in Tempe!

Try every kind of topping, you will love it."}
{"text":"Love the tonkotsu ramen!! Fast service, great food, and friendly staff. I've passed by this place a few times happy I stopped in with the husband for lunch! Love how they welcome everyone in the restaurant together! Husband got the spicy miso, pic attached  stop in if you love a good bowl of soup"}
{"text":"So far, the best Ramen spot I've found in Arizona. 
When there's a line to get in, you know it's good. Worth the wait every time.
I recommend the Ultra Spicy if you are okay with a little heat."}
{"text":"I have had ramen all over the country as well as Tokyo but this was the first time I have had ramen in AZ...   And it was a very solid first!!! House make broth and noodles.  Very authentic taste.  I had the spicy miso and it was delicious!!!  Will come back on a regular basis"}
{"text":"It's wonderful ! I drove from tucson to enjoy my son & friends favorite ramen in phoenix metro area. Worth the journey! I had the traditional ramen served in beautiful ceramic bowl with wooden ladle. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the 1908s film, thrilled to have this restaurant down the street from me.  I lived in Japan and loved ramen shops.  The owners seem like real purists, making homemade ramen.  This is not your store-bought stuff.  Excellent flavors, although the ramen doesn't taste exactly like I remember it.  My guess is, not all the genuine ingredients are available here.  That said, the service is excellent and the ramen is delicious.  Get there early, because there's usually a crowd, although ramen is eaten quickly.  I hope they expand, because it's very tight (although this is an authentic feel as well).  I couldn't take my 75 year old mother here, because she would not be comfortable in the high-tops.  I'll keep going, though!"}
{"text":"Not many ramen places in PHX to compare it to, but the ramen here tastes really good. At least better than some of the more divey Japanese restaurants I've been to. I tried the Tonkatsu ramen (not really spicy enough) and the Spicy Tonkatsu ramen (bit too spicy), and both had good flavor. Luckily there's lots of customizable options for the ramen so I will make my Goldilocks-somewhat-spicy tonkatsu ramen next time. 
The service was really friendly, and were always quick to refill my water glass when I needed it (the spicy ramen's fault). 
The restaurant itself is in the strip mall behind the gas station on McClintock and Southern. Nothing fancy looking, but nicely renovated inside. Not a lot of seating, so large groups might not work well here - 4 or less should be easy enough. 
I think they have sake in the fridge, but I wish they had beer."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen I've had so far since moving here to Arizona. I had the ultra spicy ramen opt with regular noodles. It's was spicy for my tastebuds but I really enjoyed. You get greeted by \"irasshaimase.\" Servers were really nice, they were on top of their game. I live out in Avondale, and I would drive out to Tempe just for ramen."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant.  Service was quick, Ramen was amazingly delicious..."}
{"text":"Such good ramen! I got the rich broth with my ramen and it was the best decision. At first I didn't think it would be enough food, but it was the perfect amount for me. Enough where I was able to get full but not too much where there was so much extra that I thought that I was wasting food. Only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was the waiter. He was tentative at first because they weren't busy, but as more and more people showed up he basically ignored us. But that is all the complaints I had! Delicious ramen! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! The soy milk ramen is incredible you have to get the $2 addition of the hard boiled eggs. I don't know what kind of magic they use to hard boil them but they are damn tasty."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen in the valley by far. I recently just found this place after a friend introduced it to me. I've been here twice since then. I've ordered the spicy miso ramen and the curry ramen.

The spicy miso ramen is excellent. It's spicy, but doesn't over do it since I like to actually taste my food (my friend got the ultra spicy ramen, it was good, but too spicy for my taste). The broth was very rich and flavorful (without even ordering the rich broth option). The meat was cooked just right, very soft, tender, and juicy. The egg was soft boiled which I really enjoyed but that's preference.

The curry ramen is just noodles and curry stew over it, don't expect much. However this is exactly what I expected it to be since curry stew is one of my favorite go to dishes. The curry was very flavorful and as expected. I would recommend if you enjoy curry stew type dishes.

I also tried some Hirata buns, something I've not seen in Arizona. They were very tasty, soft, and flavorful. I would say they probably over do the amount of mayo they put in, but it still tasted great. The other appetizer we tried was the takowasabi (raw octopus and wasabi), this is essentially octopus and fresh wasabi in a small cup. If you're never had fresh wasabi before, you'll want to try it, it's very different from the powder/paste wasabi that's more dominant in the area. However, expect something different from the norm if you're trying this dish.

The service was okay, average. I could knock them down one star for service, but who really cares? I don't go to a restaurant for service, I go to eat good food. Nothing to complain or rave about.

To address some of the other reviews, I'm not sure what ramen places they've eaten, but this place is likely the most authentic one in the Phoenix metro area. I say this with lots of travel experience and food comparisons from all over east Asia and California ramen joints. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed if you're looking for authentic ramen, it's not the best but as good as you'll get in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is my first time here I have a very good impression. Me and my little brother got the Spicy Muso Ramen. The ramen wasn't that spicy but it was still good. The waitress was very nice and took care of use and asked us if we wanted more ramen. Our bill come out to around twenty dollars which is pretty cheap. My little brother thought It wasn't spicy but he good with it. I would recommend this restaurant for anybody who want a taste of Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to go to as much as I can. It feels good to come here especially after work. Most authentic Japanese joint to grub. I love the tradition and the respect. Easy staff to get along with. I'll always keep coming back here and leaving with a smile on my face. You guys are awesome. Don't ever change and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"While they do offer a vegetarian ramen option, I would not recommend this to the vegetarian crowd. Their soy-milk only broth was milky and did not have the Japanese flavor I was expecting. It was way too overpowering and I could not finish my plate. The noodles were good though and my SO had a pork ramen that he enjoyed. I was hoping that they'd have a water based vegetarian broth so seeing the milk based broth was a big disappointment. The service was quick and the servers were nice. I just wish I could have liked my dish."}
{"text":"This is as close to legitimate Japanese ramen as it gets in the Phoenix metro.  However that is not saying much, it is just saying how terrible our other options are at places like Republic Ramen, Umami, Dozo Izawaya, and Sushi Ken.  I give the food 4 stars but I took one star off for the terrible service.  I will get into that in a bit.

I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with added heavier soup flavoring ($1 more) and also added bamboo shoots ($2 more).  Visually the bowl of noodles look the part with typical toppings of sliced green scallions, wood ear mushrooms, and bean sprouts.  The soup stock is pretty good with plenty of flavor, the self-made noodles were cooked al dente with nice texture, and the half-cooked egg had good creamy and gooey texture.  The char-su pork slice, however, was horrendous.  They are suppose to almost fall apart in your chop-sticks while you pick them up and melt in your mouth.  I should not be trying to tear off a bite with my mouth as if I am trying to tear apart a piece of steak.

Now onto the service.  My wife, daughter and I were there on a Friday night with good a good amount of crowd, however the place wasn't packed out the door that you typically see at good ramen places in Los Angeles.  After we were seated it took us a good 15 minutes before we just gave up and grab the menu ourselves.  After we determined what we want to order we closed the menus showing that we were ready to order.  However it took us another good 20 minutes after witnessing another larger party, that came in later than us, getting their orders taken right away before I had to yell at the waitress if we can please get our orders taken. We were never checked ok how we are doing or whether or not my daughter's empty water cup needed a refill.  Also I should never have to get up and walk across the restaurant just to grab a napkin to wipe my face.

Needless to say I left a sub-par tip."}
{"text":"We drive by this place all the time and it is always packed and happening. So my husband took the family to this place to try it out finally. Boy was it far from what we expected. What ever Ramon bowl we chose was so gross we couldn't finish it. And we both chose different bowls. I had the popular choice and my husband got a spicy one, the kids wouldn't touch either. What ever piece of meat that was floating around in it was unrecognizable and not pretty. The plus side was the pot stickers were pretty good. And the bottled fruit soda I got was pretty good (full of chemicals and awful ingredients though). The only reason I can imagine us not liking it to the mass amount of people we see there is we normally eat organic, non-gmo, grass fed, blah blah and they were far from it. Sorry tampopo but your a no no."}
{"text":"As a japanese. I eat ramen almost everyday in japan. Their ramen is not that good for me. I love the noodles but i dont like the soup they made. I ordered tokotsu ramen. Its my opinion. Try and find out."}
{"text":"OK - I chose this place because it was the review of the day. I read her review and it was awesome, but read some others that were negative and just thought those people were being annoying...

It truly is a cute little hole in the wall. There isn't a ton of room and it seems like a cool mom and pop place where you feel good spending your money. The thing is...the food just isn't that good! It sucks because I was so excited about the machine that makes the noodles and based on the good reviews I was so excited! We had the gyoza and the pork belly to start. Both were ok...nothing special...we ate them...and then shared the spicy ramen. The noodles looked, felt and tasted just like regular pasta to me...and the broth was ok... not as much flavor as I have had before or even made at home. 

It just was either missing something or just not that special. The service was ok - nothing special just like the food. Its such a bummer to give not as good reviews - I kind of hate it really. I wanted so badly for this place to rock and be able to take friends and go more regularly, but it didn't do it for me. Unless someone I know goes again and tells me its the most amazing thing and they've changed and the flavors and food and service are the most amazing thing ever and I am an idiot for missing out, I probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"First time eating at Ramen restaurant. Food was very good. Food presentation was very creative and beautiful. Waiters were very attentive and explained the menu and dishes throughly. Menu was well thought out. Atmosphere was casual friendly. Great place to bring small children. Food was served amazingly fast.  Prices were very cheap with large portions. Food was healthy (except a lot of carbs but you would expect that with a noodle dish). I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"So yummy! We went to Japan in March and this place is spot on! Did not try the takoyaki to test though-that will be next time!"}
{"text":"My son took me here and I can't even put into words how good my experience was. First the customer service was amazing; the staff was friendly, fast, and efficient. All the food came out piping hot. 
I had the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was good all the way to my soul, and bonus it cleared my sinuses. The broth was steamy and spicy with the perfect amount of salt, the pork was tender, egg cooked perfectly, and the ramen was not gummy. It was just a perfect bowl of deliciousness and very filling! 

Here's a little tip ask for a fork if your uncoordinated, I tried to be cute and use chopsticks and had a major fail."}
{"text":"NOT HONEST RESTAURANT. Keeps missing stuff for to-go order. It happened 2 times to me as I can remember. For the first time, I thought they made mistakes, so I didn't care. And for the second time, when I picked up, I confirmed with the guy with my order, and he said everything is included. But after I got home, it turned out that it missed something again. This time they didn't put roasted pork in soymilk ramen. I called them, asked if the soymilk ramen should come with roasted pork. They replied No, it serves for Veges. Then I said I just checked with menu, it says roasted pork. Then he was like I'm sorry but still kind making some excuses. HARD TO BELIEVE !"}
{"text":"We usually go to the ramen place in Tempe, but thought we'd try this place for something new.  It's where Cafe Wasabi used to be.  I got the tonkotsu and my dining partner had the spicy ramen.  He said he liked his better than the other place, but we both agreed that the tonkotsu had no flavor whatsoever.  The noodles were good, but I hate it when restaurants give you a huge chunk of fatty meat with no way to eat it without looking like a caveman.  Also, the seats are pretty uncomfortable.  We'll give it another shot, but I am definitely going to try a different dish with (hopefully) more flavor."}
{"text":"The decore was clean ans inviting. Service was great. Now let's get to the food. I ordered the miso ramen. The soup was slightly on the salty side and was a bit too thick. The dashi stock component was somewhat lacking, so the broth came out somewhat flat in terms of aroma.  The egg was slightly overcooked, and the marinade didnt penetrate the egg well enough.  The ramen noodles was spot on.  The tonkatsu pork was on point. I loved how there was more fat in the meat than most places, ao it didn't taste dry like most places. Would I come back?  Yes, but I'll probably order something else.  The food wasn't too bad, but it just needs some improvement"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, tasty ramen. This restaurant used to be a sushi place but has now been converted to serve delectable freshly pulled noodles. 

I ordered the tampopo ramen ($8) with the rich broth upgrade ($1 extra). It was served in a short amount of time, and a hearty portion of veggies, a nicely cooked whole egg, noodles, and meat. The broth was indeed rich and flavorful and the noodles were very fresh with a chewy texture. The pork was well seasoned and went well with the ramen.

Service was good and I was checked up on as needed. Note that there is no soda fountain so soda is by the can or bottle (Coke products and Ramune).

The space itself is quite small so it can feel a bit cramped. There are only a few side tables that sit 2, a very long table in the center, and bar seating.

I'll definitely come here again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:
Wrote a long review explaining everything and it didn't save, so here's the reader digest, because I don't have the energy to write it again. 

Was served undercooked pork. Broth is bland and flavorless. No service. Server didn't come by once. When we finally did interact with the server, it was only to collect payment and we finally got the chance to tell them about the undercooked pork and they didn't bother to do anything. 

Ambience was awful with top 40 hits."}
{"text":"First time here! Was pleasantly surprised. A smaller more intimate establishment with limited seating but not to bad for a Friday night. We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken. A couple of minutes later our orders were placed and the food was put in less than 10 mins. Service was fast and friendly! Our selections were awesome. Definitely recommend the Gyoza. Some of the best I have ever had and these are my favorite appetizer of all time. The spicey Ramen was amazing. The broth was definitely the best flavor we have tasted. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love good ramen. So naturally I've been on the hunt for a good ramen house. Thanks to yelp, I've found my go to place for quality ramen!
My wife and I came here for our weekend date night and really had a great time. We enjoyed the wooden ladle and chopsticks as well as that 1/2 the ramen house was filled with people speaking Japanese.  
The ramen was fantastic and we even got the imported Japanese soda for fun. 
We will certainly be going back again and again. 

***I did order extra noodles after devouring the first batch that came with my bowl and noticed they seemed to be slightly less cooked than our original set... maybe this is normal?"}
{"text":"The ramen here is so delicious and full of flavor! This is now my new favorite place to eat. I love how you can watch your food being made right in front of you. The ramen is made fresh and I'm glad that there is more ramen then broth."}
{"text":"Came here basically on a whim.  It's not up to Las Vegas ramen standards but seems like maybe one of the better joints in the Phoenix metro.  I may return sometime and give them another try.  But my first impression is that this is Americanized ramen and doesn't match any authentic ramen style that I am aware of.  But I could be wrong.  Not to come across as a racist jerk, but I did notice that there was nothing but very young white employees in the kitchen and as servers, and there are no Japanese entry/exit greetings.  Since I'm not a Phoenix resident, maybe this is not unusual here.

I got the spicy miso ramen with added karaage.  100% not spicy, not even 'white people spicy'.  Broth is a little weirdly sweet, as others have mentioned, which may just be because of what tasted like sweet pickled bamboo shoots (so weird).  There was also sushi-style red ginger in wide slices.  Normally miso is put into the house pork, chicken, or combo broth, but it honestly tasted like the miso was just mixed into water.  This made the broth oddly too thick and too thin on flavor at the same time.  The broth was not at all hot enough.  I did see that you could select \"extra rich\" broth but I wasn't really sure what that meant (are they watering the broth down if you don't get this??  make extra fatty? be more clear) and for my first visit, decided to try the broth as-is.  I prefer a little more fatty and meaty broth.

The fresh noodles tasted good, but they both looked and tasted exactly like fresh spaghetti noodles, they didn't seem alkaline, springy/bouncy at all.  Karaage was okay.  I personally did like the slightly blackened BBQ-style charsiu but I could see why others might prefer the traditional style.  The egg is pretty good, semi-soft.  The prices are totally fair and the service was pretty good.  I feel like this place could be vastly more improved with a better and more authentic broth recipe.  The potential is there."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try ramen, it was ok. Nothing too exciting or special about this place."}
{"text":"What more can I say about a place that makes their own noodles in house. I had their grilled squid for an appetizer and it was simply amazing, I could eat that all day long. I also had their spicy ramen & I should've gone with the ultra spicy but it's my own fault. Everything about the flavor & their service was simply an incredible experience. I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Wish they had more options (like adding chicken or different broths) but what they do offer is good. I ain't goin' hate"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  Consistently delicious. If you haven't been here,  stop reading and go."}
{"text":"I was watching a YouTube video about 2 guys who were \"noodle masters\", which got me very hungry so my husband and I grabbed our son and came here because of all the good reviews, not out of convenience, trust me.

Anyway, we get here and thankfully I'm a little person because this place is pretty crammed with both people and tables in such a small place. We figure, \"Whatever, we didnt come here to go furniture shopping, we came for the food.\" So we sit down and look at the menu.

First thing I notice is all the ramen has pork in it. Our son and I don't eat pork. So I ask the waiter if they dont mind substituting the pork for their fried chicken even if it costs extra. He looks at us annoyed and says, \"We cannot substitute it but we can remove the pork and charge $3 for the fried chicken to be put in instead.\" I look at my husband and ask, \"Is that not what I asked?\" Not to make our waiter feel stupid but I was thinking maybe I worded my question wrong, but my husband looks at him and asks, \"So you can substitute the pork for chicken for a $3 charge?\" The waiter looked even more annoyed but to stop a big debacle from taking place in front of our son, I just said, \"Yes, okay. Please remove the pork from mine and my sons and add chicken, that's fine. Thank you.\"

The food came out fairly quickly and we had forgotten all about our little miscommunication with the waiter earlier and were having a good time. Took a bite of my food and it was a little salty but, oh my word, the chicken was delicious. There were only 3 little chicken nugget sized chickens in a big bowl so I savored every bite. My son, who is an 11yr old seasoned ramen eater, enjoyed his Miso soup very much. My husband didnt spend much time talking to us once he got a taste of his spicy ramen soup so I can only assume that his empty bowl a couple of minutes later meant he also enjoyed it.

So overall, great food just plan on overhearing everyone else's conversation because that person will most likely be sitting on your lap anyway. And don't be discouraged by the waiter if he gives you a little bit of an attitude, the food is worth it and everyone has bad days."}
{"text":"Yum!! The food is a big five stars. Space 4 stars. 

They opened for dinner at 5pm. We arrived around 5:30 and already every seat was filled. It's a very small space. It resembles a Ramen House in Japan. We only had to wait about 10 mins. Not bad at all. 

You won't have much elbow room. Most space is communal tables. It adds to the charm a little. I give the space 4 stars. Even though the space is authentic, I'm American, and I like a little more room to slurp my ramen. 

I had the seafood ramen with spicy paste, egg, and seaweed. The order came out quickly. It was more than I could eat. But if you're extra hungry, the menu mentioned $2 refills. 

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ramen and service is really good. Layout was a little tight. They sat me in this weird counter with the wall right behind me. Has the spicy miso ramen with braised pork as an add on, and it was great. I usually don't finish my soup but I finished everything in my bowl. I am already planning to go back with more friends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here for the first time. There was a little wait line but we figured it might be worth the wait.  We were not disappointed...the braised pork belly and pork on bun were so delicious! The dumplings were just average, we did order some ramen noodles but were too full to eat anymore so we took it top go. The seating reminded us of NYC where you sitting side by side with people you don't know. ..which is also why I didn't give them a 5. I would recommend this place higher than 4
 Other than that,  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"The difference between the service given when they first opened and now are incredibly different, and definitely not for the better. The wait for ramen after ordering is ridiculously long and when it comes out, it isn't hot, it is barely lukewarm. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Delish!  Came here with the homie and got some wings (damn good) and then we both got the spicy super hot noodles. I got mine with regular noodles wich helped (cuz I'm a spice woos sometimes). I recommend going!!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, it was good but lacked meat, definitely very tasty, but the restaurant was rather cramped. I'd recommend sitting at the high table or the bar to avoid feeling like you're pushed against the wall at the awkward oblong couples tables, but forget that, you're reading this to hear more about the food.

I ordered the spicy miso ramen while the hubby got the seafood ramen. Completely different flavors with the seafood ramen being a milder, clear broth, while mine was an opaque-ish orange and obviously more spicy. Tons of noodles, broth to die for, but as I said before, lacking in meat. It was really tasty, don't get me wrong, so go in with the expectation of having good ramen with amazing broth and you won't be disappointed. Great for a cold, rainy day...when we get those."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen- we ordered traditional and seafood.  Don't forget the egg! Small place but we had fun sitting at the long communal table"}
{"text":"Really great ramen, broth is so flavorful and love that the noodles are al dente instead overly cooked! Service was fast and really friendly! The chef made some changes for me due to dietary restrictions!"}
{"text":"I will stat up front the reason I'm not giving this place only 1 star. And that is I know not everyone is all about meat. This place maybe just fine for you if your a vegetarian or just not a huge meat eater. That being said , I myself do like ramen but like it with a good amount of meat . I tried branching out and trying this place out of convenience . first thing I noticed and disliked was how cramped it is . I'm a big buy and this space is very small as it is but on top of that they cram so many tables in here its nearly impossible to walk through the isles with out having to turn side ways and bump into people sitting down. Or be bumped into while your eating. The place only had like 7 guests but still felt to full. They should take out the middle row and do something else. I sat down and was greated by one person who I asked some questions to then didn't see them again and someone else 5 min later asked me for my order. Which is a bit long for something like this . I then ordered 3 times meat... Cus I could see they did not put much in their ramen. I made it very clear I wanted a lot. What I got was 5 medium at best dry pieces of pork . the broth was okay . they do offer more noodles if you want which is cool but none of their ingredients were all that tasty . under seasoned and texture wise seemed like they sit out and just add them to the broth rather then cook stuff fresh . or they just over cook stuff. The bill came and I for sure got charged for 3 times meat ... Not sure how 5 peices is three times . but was way to expensive . horrible experience here."}
{"text":"The ramen was good and flavorful. The reason for the 1 star is because my family ate there in the middle of the day, in June,  when the weather was well into the hundreds and as soon as we walked in the restaurant there was no immediate, \"ahhhh...\" feeling like we've escaped the inferno... NO, it was HOT in the restaurant. We decided to stay because my family love ramen and wanted to eat there.  After we all ordered I asked our waiter if they could please adjust the air... the waiter said, \"yes I've already talked to the owner about it, and I was told no.\" So we ate our soup with beads of sweat running down our faces. Again, the food was good but eating soup in the summer in a hot restaurant with the owner unwilling to adjust the air was not comfortable or appealing... I won't be back in until winter"}
{"text":"I always have to try the ramen in every city that I travel to and this was no different.  Small quaint place but definitely had all the right Japanese ramen vibes.

Everyone greeted us in Japanese when we arrived and when we left which was a nice touch and exactly what EVERY true Japanese Ramen bar does in Japan.  They have table seating and bar seating if you want to see the behind the scenes with the cooks.  We opted to sit at the bar to see all the goodies they're churning out.

I ordered the Ultra Spicy Ramen and my fiancé the Spicy Miso.  Don't let the name fool you as none of them were that spicy.  Mine left a nice zing to the pallet but I wasn't downing glasses or water and calling my mommy for help.  My fiancé even asked for some chili oil to up the intensity of hers.  Regardless of the spicy level, the ramen themselves were very good.  

My favorite of the whole experience was the chashu pork.  They are made in house, cooked, sliced and then flame charred with a torch to put on a nice layer or crispy deliciousness.  By far the best I've ever had.  Second thing I'd have to commend these guys on is the egg.  Most if not all the other ramen bars I've been to only gives you half an egg.  Here you get a whole one.  First time ever I left a ramen bar feeling full.  Great job guys, keep up the good food"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was great. My boyfriend got the original one listed first on the ramen list. I would recommend either if you love ramen. I love that the spicy miso has so much ginger in it. Everything tasted fresh and the broth was perfectly thick."}
{"text":"After a challenging upper body workout my best friend and I had a ramen craving. Before Republic Ramen had been or go-to but recently his loyalty shifted to Tampopo.Tampopo is more authentic with J-pop and authentic japanese toppings. However I hate to say it but Republic satisfied my ramen needs much better. I must note, the staff agreed to seat us about 6 minutes after their 3pm lunch break. If you didn't know their head chef takes a break for two hours starting at 3.

First off, the Onigiri was bad. The rice was dried out and the topping was composed primarily of pork fat. How did this even make it on to my plate? Literally 60% fat 40% pork. I didn't want to ruin my friends regular status   and start some bad blood... but when every other bite contains small cubes of pork fat the $4.00 I spent on it was not worth it. This was a huge disappointment which was probably the staffs way to get back at me for cutting in to their 2hour break.

The pork ramen was solid, if a bit underseasoned. The portion was skimpy compared to Republic and the broth was not as hot as it should be. I liked the seasoning on the pork, but like the broth the pork was well under temperature. I took a sip of my friends extra spicy ramen and enjoyed the broth a lot more. Maybe I will order that next time. I paid  for a mushroom upgrade but they tasted like dirt marinated cabbage. Diners should also factor in that this is full service, and tips are required for this dining experience making my check cost more than Republic."}
{"text":"Must have been an off day. My wife and I ordered the tonkotsu ramen on Friday night and we were completely disappointed. The broth and pork slice were completely flavorless. I was forced to add a lot of soy sauce because the broth was incredibly bland. We're not the type to return food so we ate what we could and won't come back sadly. Noddles were good, I'll give em that."}
{"text":"The ramen tasted fresh, and the broth was flavorful. Portion was a little bit smaller than we had expected. The wait staff was friendly and courteous. It's definitely a smaller restaurant so if the thought of sitting next to a stranger gives you anxiety, you might want to rethink this."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best Raman in town.  Wish it was closer but worth the drive.  The extra rich broth is the only way to go!  The pork is melt in your mouth.  Bean sprouts are always fresh and crispy.  They make the noodles in house and they are the best around.  The perfect texture and nice and thin.  Check it out for dining in or take out!"}
{"text":"Is this place a fad or what?  Went here a few weeks ago with an Ethnic Lunch Meetup group.  The menu is simple and short on variety, but it IS a ramen restaurant so that's what you get:  ramen in all sorts of different broths to choose from with different proteins.

I got the spicy ramen with two slices of pork and a hard boiled egg.  It was definitely spicy in a reddish thick broth.  It was OK.  One guy got the Curry Ramen and didn't like it--said it had no flavor.  One lady ordered the octopus balls as an appetizer.  While the presentation was pretty, they were a gooey mess inside.  I was not a fan.

If you order a soft drink or iced tea, they will bring it in a can with a glass of ice.  They do have beer and sake.

I don't need to go back here.  I think they have a lot of fans, so that's good."}
{"text":"So I feel the quality has gone a bit since I last visited, or I was just there on an off day, but I still immensely enjoyed my rich broth tonkotsu ramen sans onions and sprouts with some added corn. 

I think the main difference was the braised pork belly appetizer I ordered, it wasn't crispy at all and just kinda.. there.  The taste was pretty close to what I remember but the texture wasn't doing it for me, and that is what makes this place my fav. 

Other than that, the broth was delicious and I even ordered some of the fried chicken to try out in the soup.. was a good choice, especially with the pork belly mishap.. the included chashu pork melted into my mouth via the silly wooden spoons, and the half boiled egg made it all worth it. 

Until next time!"}
{"text":"Tampopo Ramen, is a unique little shop on the plaza of Ross. It's truly to its words about ramen! Meaning true Japanese authentic food! No Americanized sake bombers or none of that! Prices are really reasonable to not need a happy hour! You'll easily spend 20 dollars and under for one person or maybe even 2. You pay for quality and of course you get quantity too! Bowls have 4-5 choices and of course you can add your own ingredients for less than 3-1 dollar more! Bowls are huge for one person! So bring an appetite! I've been here twice so far and loving it every time . I wanna try everything's. Service is wonderful and just an good ambience inside! But the only downfall is it gets packed cause it's mainly set up for one or 2 people per party so if you have 4 or more it might be a wait but that's it. I'd say it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is kawaii! I like the authentic feel and barstool seating. The staff were great, real cheery. Tonkatsu ramen was tasty, but nothing I'd crave. We were disappointed by the super limited vegetarian options. Bae described the soy milk broth as, \"not too creamy, perfect amount of spicy, but not delicious, just okay\". I was jealous that the dude next to us had steamed buns. I'll go back to try that! But bae doesn't want to come.... That's okay."}
{"text":"Tiny place but the fresh ramen was awesome. They make it in house and you can see the little room and machine where they prepare it. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was delish. Will definitely be back for more! Wish I lived closer...."}
{"text":"Not bad ramen place in Tempe! 

We came here on a whim and the place was absolutely packed! It looks like a small \"mom & pop\" shop that is totally brought to life with all the people that fill up the place!

The menu is pretty easy to follow. Most people stick with the regular Tonkotsu ramen and add things to it if they want to make it more special.  Do the $1 extra for the rich broth, you can definitely tell the difference. 

We also shared some squid ball appetizers before getting our ramen. They taste alright. Kinda reminds me of eating a stuffing ball with a little bit of mayo and hoisin sauce on it. I wouldn't get it again if I came back. 

The broth of the ramen, even when I got rich one was still so-so. I've actually tasted better broths compared to having pho or beef noodle soup, or Tom yum goong. The noodles were fresh, but it wasn't I was expecting. Maybe it's because I'm just used to eating ramen out of a packet, but the texture reminded me more of spaghetti.  The boiled egg in there was awesome though! The fried chicken add on that I got was not good and not worth $3.  I also got the roe because it was recommended on the menu, I didn't really taste it to be honest. 

I feel bad for leaving a so-so review, but it's my honest opinion. Maybe I just don't like going out to eat ramen, and I always thought of it as a cheap food that you make special cause you make it your own at home."}
{"text":"If you need authentic ramen, look no further! This spot is narrow and long, just like their noodles. So if sitting next to a stranger freaks you out, you may be better off sticking to the cup o noodles. I ordered the original tonkotsu ramen and it was fantastic.  Rich and thick broth with fresh chewy noodles. I added pork belly because I'm not stupid and ended up with the best bowl of ramen I've had in AZ. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"That was the worst \"ramen\" I have ever had. I literally had to put it down my garbage disposal and it stunk up my house.. Noodles weren't cooked, and there was no flavor."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews, I was super stoked to try this new ramen place. I got the tori karrage, the Japanese fried chicken, as an appetizer. The chicken was overcooked, rendering the outside to be hard, and inside meat to be dry and chewy - I wasn't very impressed. 

As for the ramen, my boyfriend and I both got the tonkotsu ramen, adding the rich soup for an additional $1. Honestly, the broth was overly salty and not flavorful/rich. It makes me curious to know how the regular broth would have been since we requested the rich soup (aka concentrated and flavored) and it wasn't banging rich. I was also bummed out that the egg was hard boiled instead of the soft boiled egg with runny yolk inside; the egg was overly done for me. I watched the chef blow torch the pork, and was disappointed when the pork turned out to be super chewy.  There is an option to add other toppings to the ramen, which we did not try. Overall, the ramen was pretty generic to me. This is comparing the bomb.com ramen in NorCal, such as Ramen Dojo and Orenchi. 

The service was fantastic though. The waiters were very attentive and efficient at what they were doing. They really tried hard to make a good impression. Excellent service - it's just the ramen was satisfactory, nothing unique. However, a good alternative if you're craving for some ramen in AZ."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend. I'm not a big ramen person but he is. We both thought it was ok but could have been better. We got the flash fried chicken app. Chicken was ok but it was served with a powered dip thing on the side which we both thought was parm cheese but actually seemed to be salt?... idk. We both got the basic ramen with some additions. We both agreed the pork was flavorless and the rest was nothing to write home about. The service was good and the place was plenty busy for a Tuesday night so maybe it was just not for us."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today. My sister-in-law took me it was her 3rd time this week! I was not let down. The service was prompt and friendly and the food was delicious! I will go back as soon as I get the chance!"}
{"text":"I am big fan of ramen although I cannot count myself as a connoisseur. I came in solo and sat down at the counter facing the kitchen to watch the huge vats of boiling broth and grilled pork belly being prepared. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with extra green onions and broth concentrate. The first bite knocked my flip flops off! The difference was clearly in the noodles which are handmade on the premises (the noodle room). The broth was excellent and nothing went to waste. They even offer the option of having another portion of noodles to help you finish your broth but I was already in a food coma by then.

I am lucky I don't live near this gem of a restaurant as I would be hitting it up 2-3 times per week. Not only for the value, but for the taste of Japan which I last visited 12 years ago. I would love to try some of the appetizers on a future visit."}
{"text":"This is the better ramen places here in AZ. I came from LA and even had gone to Japan and it's annoying that people are comparing this place to LA, Bay Area, etc. That is not fair. As a ramen place in AZ, its decent.
I've noticed that the quality of ramen and taste of ramen falls short whenever it gets busy. When I go on non-peak times the ramen seems to be better. The takoyaki here is pretty good.
Aside from that, service is getting better since they have opened. While I love the cozy atmosphere, it gets a bit annoying when (not to be racist) foreign exchange students come in and dine since they are loud and don't know any table manners.(I seriously cringed  when this guy next to me slurped and made noises due to the spicy ramen. Please learn some manners)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid ramen! Definitely college-esque. Low prices, ramen is solid for the prices. Get the pork belly, super tasty. Generous toppings, sweet corn was tasty. Note you only get 1 slice of pork in the ramen and the egg is not cut but whole. Tasty stuff overall"}
{"text":"Went in there tonight, even though there were open tables we were forced to wait about 10 minutes before being acknowledged. After waiting another good bit of time we walked out without ordering. Horrible service."}
{"text":"This is by farrrrrrrr my favorite place to get ramen! It blows Republic Ramen out of the water. My favorite ramen is the spicy miso. It has pork, pickled ginger, pickled bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, scallions and a half boiled egg (probably my favorite part). The broth is AMAZING and has such great flavor. It's mild enough that even those who don't normally eat spicy food can still enjoy it and if you want it spicier they will be happy to make it spicier! I've had grilled octopus there which was super delicious and their gyoza which deserves to be hyped up more! It's fair priced for how great it is and how authentic the noodles are. I always get my spicy miso with kakuni. Kakuni is pork belly and it basically melts in your mouth with an amazing savory sweet flavor. 10/10 I will always be here when I need my ramen fix!"}
{"text":"First visit to Tampopo last night. My son went with a friend a few weeks ago and has been talking about going back ever since. 
We both ordered the spicy miso ramen. It was tasty! We were both happy with our food. 
It was really busy, every seat was taken at dinner time. There were a ton of employees but as far as I could tell there were only two servers and one girl who was seating and filling water glasses. Our server forgot about us for long periods of time.  He was probably stretched too thin and he didn't have time to check on us. We sat for at least 10 minutes trying to flag him down in order to order more noodles. By the time we received our noodles, our soup was cold. 
The restaurant is small space. It seems to be popular for young patrons. I don't consider myself old but I am pretty sure I was one of the oldest in there last night. 
I'm looking forward to trying more ramen shops around town. I don't really have much to compare tampopo too, but we did enjoy the food. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is where you can get authentic Japanese Ramen. The soup is incredible very tasty very rich. The line could get really really long and there is no reservation. Be there when it opens to escape the crowds."}
{"text":"First time here. I was not disappointed the food was delicious and customer service was great too. But if you are wondering why the four stars... the place had their music playing a little too loud. But overall I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Tried something new from the usual tonkotsu ramen and got the soy milk ramen, which is a mix or tonkotsu broth and soymilk. Definitely an interesting taste, like a Japanese Alfredo is what I would describe it. The soy milk brings a creaminess to the broth from a taste and not a texture stand point. Adding a mouthful of peppers with a bite of pork reminisces more of fajitas than ramen to me. Bottom line it was just not for me. My boyfriend got the spicy shoyu ramen which was more in line with traditional ramen tastes."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

I've been on the hunt for a particular tonkosu ramen flavor that I once experienced in New York. I have been to many ramen places here, but it was the tonkosu ramen here that has most resembled my experience in New York! Mmmm, the flavor was so good. I ordered the tonkosu ramen with rich broth for a $1 extra. Definitely a fan and definitely plan to come back.

The place was also clean and service was great. I sat at the side facing where they prepare the food. The chef is friendly, shouts when someone enters and says thank you and bye before you leave. I can't wait to try the other dishes, but it might be difficult since it will be hard to choose something other than the tonkosu ramen for me. Lol."}
{"text":"Life changing in every way.  Sets the standard for every ramen dish I will ever have again.  I can't wait to go back just wish it wasn't so far from me!  Hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Was absolutely thrilled to hear about a new ramen opening up, even if it was all the way in Tempe I was determined to try it!

Bright, small, enclosed ramen shop located next to a Starbucks in a plaza. The shop was not crowded at all during dinner. It was new, so I figured it would be okay.

I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and an order of Takoyaki. The Spicy Miso Ramen had ginger, miso paste, green onions and charshu. I ordered an egg to go with it. As for Takoyaki, it is a fried ball with octopus and pickled ginger on the inside.

Yes, Takoyaki, yes! This definitely takes me back to the amazing Takoyaki I get at ramen places back in California's South Bay. Slightly crisp and browned exterior and filled with a hot, fluffy texture and piece of octopus that has a good chewy, bite. Great flavor and generous with the bonito flakes! The ramen on the other hand was a bit disappointing. The broth was good, but lacked complexity in flavors which is surprising as miso is savory, salty and has a unique flavor about it. The broth also was not spicy and was brought up to the attention of my server to verify if it was indeed spicy miso, there was no spice detected in the ramen at all. The charshu was cut thickly and incredibly chewy and lacked a roasted edge. Noodles made in house and were chewy, but stick straight (personally not a stick straight noodle gal) but the texture was decent and made up the majority of the bowl. Toppings didn't do much to accent the ramen and eggs are not included in the ramen, they were of additional cost and are marinated hard boiled eggs. All in all, I didn't enjoy the ramen as much as I would have liked. I would return to try their non-ramen choices though!

The service was good in that the staff was attentive and answered questions I had, many of the servers were young but provided great service. The place is clean, but small as mentioned before but not overly loud- good environment for dining.

To make things short, yes to Takoyaki and no to ramen here for me."}
{"text":"Great ramen place. While the broth could use a little bump in flavor, the real highlight is the meat. Very tender and high quality. I order the spicy miso with added kakumi (pork belly). Some of the toppings are not my style (ginger) but it is still good. The one issue I always have here is that the egg is over cooked. It comes out hard boiled with the yolk cooked all the way through. I wish they could get the runny yolk right as it would really make the difference here. Even so, this place is great and I would recommend. Pretty small restaurant so it can get busy at times and is not great for big groups."}
{"text":"Good broth, good noodles, good options. Continually looking for a good ramen place and this place fits the bill. Pork sealed the deal for me, delicious and they give you a good amount. Good price for ramen too."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best ramen & only real Japanese ramen place I've come across so far in Phoenix! I ordered the gyoza (nothing special) and the spicy miso ramen (8/10). I added the pork belly (10/10) which was amazing!! I got an extra egg & their egg was on point! 

Overall, this is the best ramen place you'll find in Phoenix, but it's not the best ever."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place but unfortunately was disappointed. 

Takoyaki was semi-cooked and not enough flavor. 

Tonkatsu Ramen smelled of Pork going bad. Noodles were very tough. No flavor, only the pork taste. 

The staff was friendly and fast and this is where the stars come in. 

I had chosen this place as not many places have takoyaki on the menu and my friend who has travelled and lived in Japan was craving good Japanese food. We both left very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Tonkatsu ramen was not on par. The soup base has something odd to it. Taste is kinda like when the meat/bone wasn't processed to remove the blood prior to cooking.

The takoyaki was missing wasabi.

The egg, even though it was halfcooked, it wasn't quite right.

Had high hopes going in, and walked away disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but i was very impressed with the food. I really love ramen. I usually make it myself at home but I was in the area and very hungry.  Will be back when I'm in the area again.



Can't help but mention that ridiculous review by Joe Y. I truly hope he never goes back because I don't think I could help but roll my eyes by such ridiculous behavior."}
{"text":"Quick update review.

Ordered the braised pork belly appetizer for the first time.  It's fine - nice soy sauce flavor, melt in your mouth as pork belly should be.  It's not mind blowing.

Ordered the tonkotsu ramen for the first time in a long time.  Noodles were fine, perhaps juuuuust a little overcooked.  The egg was also soft-boiled, just turning into overcooked.  Plenty of garlic oil and the rich broth made the difference.  my only complaint from this trip that mirrored my last - the pork was overcooked, charred on one side.  A little off-putting.  But all in all, still a well composed bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Came here to eat a few times so far. I usually go when they open since the place fills up. One of the best ramen places I've been to in Arizona. 
I like the spicy miso and the soymilk ramen. Good broth and noodles with a soft boiled egg to top it off. Had to order extra pork since you only get one piece  standard. The takoyaki and fried chicken were also great eats. Bill came out pretty high but not a bad treat once in a while."}
{"text":"If my friends are craving Ramen, I introduce them to Tampopo. This is probably the only place I'll go to in the Phoenix Metro. The serving is big and price is great. They also make their food pretty fast. Even my friends who were hesitant because of the food description fell in love with this place. I honestly don't know how much more I can say I love this place. So tasty!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had real ramen before. The noodles, especially the broth, was delicious.  Do not be afraid to try the dish as it comes. I got the Tonkutsu that had the black wood fungus (which scared me a bit) and it was great.

The kids split a \"plain dish\" of ramen with noodles, broth, and the egg. It took them a moment to get used to the color of the boiled egg and the length of the noodles, but they liked it as well."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find good ramen place here in AZ oppose to in HI they're everywhere. I was excited that they are starting to pop up here and hoping that there will be more options because I do love a good ramen place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times n I gotta tell ya, I get either the tankotsu or miso with grilled pork (my mouths waters as I write this) and holy hell the pork is like butter and just the overall consistency of this ramen is on point. Feels like you walked into a legit Japanese ramen shop."}
{"text":"Everything an independent noodle shop should be!  House-made noodles, regular & spicy.  Creative menu options.  All delicious!  Very clean and super friendly staff, too!"}
{"text":"Ramen broths are flavorful and the noodles are fresh.  The pork buns and gyoza are tasty. The meats are well cooked and the service is excellent. The eggs are soft boiled and flavorful.  They also have Asahi on tap and a decent selection of Sake.
I will be coming here frequently."}
{"text":"Not for me. I fully admit that I'm not a ramen expert. I didn't like the flavor of the broth, and the pork was very chewy. The best part was the soft-boiled egg."}
{"text":"This place was def hyped up for me, so that's probably why my experience wasn't as great as I had expected. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. The ramen wasn't bad at all, but it was lacking in taste. It felt kind of plain. It might have been what I ordered, but I definitely didn't walk away thinking \"Wow, this is the best ramen ever!\"  However, living in AZ we have limited ramen choices and Tampopo is probably going to be as good as it gets. 

Next time I'll try one of the donburi's and hopefully fall in love with this place."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen. The char siu pork is amazing. Just wish the fried chicken was accompanied with some sort of dipping sauce.  Best ramen I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Tampopo Ramen is THE bomb. Best tasting ramen I've had in the valley. Every time I visit, my tastebuds AND wallet leave happy.

The prices at Tampopo are fantastic. $11 Ramen, $6 rice bowls, and a full stomach?? Heck yeah. My fiancé and I usually share a ramen bowl and a rice bowl and still can't finish everything. 

The miso ramen is so tasty and I can never get enough of the broth. I always order the same thing and never get tired of it.

The fried chicken here is also perfectly cooked and crispy and pairs really well with the rice and sesame seaweed on top. I usually get the braised pork rice bowl which is also very amazing. The braised pork is so tender and just melts in your mouth. Yum 

Whenever you're craving comfort food, Tampopo is the place to go. It gets pretty busy at times which means seating can get pretty cozy since there's only bar seating, a long communal table and maybe 5 small side tables that can only fit 2 people."}
{"text":"The Good: The food is tasty, fresh, and quickly prepared. Though the menu isn't bringing much new to the table, what they offer is all solid fare, with a reasonable amount of optional extras to add to your ramen. The chicken curry over ramen was unexpected but enjoyable.1

The Bad: The drinks are overpriced, especially for canned soda without refills. 

The Ugly: The chairs are rather narrow, clearly not friendly for anyone broader than 'slender' in build. Seating is a bit limited, but I've not had to wait both times I've gone to eat there."}
{"text":"Really good ramen! Little crowded during busy tie but great service and fast. Pork belly rice bowl was AMAZING! Broth really deep and flavorful. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tasty Ramen with lots of topping options. A bit pricey if you think of it as noodles and broth, but it is more than that. The pork buns are nothing special and the meat to bun ratio was not great (too much bun). Husband had the seafood ramen while I had the pork. No need to get the extra concentrated broth as the original has plenty of flavor (and is quite SALTY). Whoa, speaking of salt we felt overly bloated and tired after dining here I'm guessing it was a combination of MSG and salt or just salt if they do not use MSG (unsure of this)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ultra Spicy Ramen, it wasn't that spicy, should have went with the Miso. There are few vegetarian options here, at least they were able to remove the pork for the bowl I had. Good service, don't think I would come back or recommend this Ramen House."}
{"text":"This place is something of a hidden gem. The menu is simple and direct. The sake and beer selection pairs well with the flavors the menu offers.This is by no means a date place. This is casual, relaxed dining. The place is on the small side. Prepare to get cozy if you are staying.

Each bowl is filling, but if you need more, $2 refills the bowl.

I love that this place understands that spicy/hot should not come at the expense of flavor. I lieder the ultra spicy all the time, but it is not just hear. There is an actual increase in bold, standout flavor as well. Adding pork and wild mushrooms or shrimp is always nice,  and these additions are not skimped on. 

For lunch or happy hour,  this place is fun and relaxed. For happy hour there are some nice deals on some interesting appetizers. Once again, even these are Ali about nice, robust flavor. It's hard to go wrong ordering anything here."}
{"text":"The broth is on point here and it's one of the better ramen places in the Valley. I also love the takoyaki. The service is sometimes slow, especially if they're busy."}
{"text":"I thought the food was ok, although the pork was almost all fat and hardly edible.  But this review is about the service.  It was terrible.  Let's start at the beginning, we waited outside in the cold because we were early, fine, no big deal.  But when we and another party both entered the restaurant around 5 minutes before open, remind you - the door was open - we can hear the staff mumble to each other about how they are not open yet.  One waiter informs us that they are not open and that if we wait they will be ready in a few, alright, we were fine with that, although it could have been phrased slightly better with a proper welcome, have a seat, like sophisticated cultured staff would do.  Kitchen staff who didn't communicate directly with customers are seemingly nice and concerned about getting the food out to the customers.  In fact the cook had to call over the waiter twice to have our food delivered.  Finally when we were ready to leave our food was not picked up and no check brought, so one of us went to inquire if we should pay at the register - me.  This is where we meet the rude long dark hair uncouth waiter.  He informs me in rude manner that I don't have to visit the register and like any other restaurant they can bring a check.  I apologized and said we were unsure and this was our first time at the restaurant,  he was not impressed, I waited for a minute assuming he would print the check since I was standing there.  Finally he prints the check and abruptly hands me the check.  He walks off and I proceed to separate mentally my portion of the check from my companions, now rude waiter returns and asks if I 'wanted it separate' - not a polite offer mind you but a more matter of fact, he shouldn't be bothered attitude.  I said yes please that would be better since we had three persons.  He then mumbled about how \"you could have said that earlier\".  Then before I could open the check envelope to see that there were three separate checks, he asks \"did I want him to bring it to us to the table too\"  I said yes, because I thought he still had the other two checks.  He now proceeds to throw up his hands in the air, and huff and puff.  I gave the separate checks to my companions as it were, since we now had separate checks.  This is a case in point of how a waiter should not be, I recommend that this staff member be reprimanded or possibly fired.  This is the epitome of rudeness and incivility.  If the owners are aware of this behavior they should be embarrassed.  I will not be returning here strictly for the malevolent nature of the service staff.    Kudos to the cooks since the food was still pretty good, but frankly, the service does not invite another visit.  Unbelievable, that service like this must be tolerated, anywhere."}
{"text":"Went there the other day with my daughter.  The ultra spicy ramen is delish. The pork buns oh man yummy!! Well worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my wife and kids, made the trek from Paradise valley to Tempe bc I've been looking for good ramen in phx.  My wife ordered the miso ramen and I got the tonkotsu ramen.  We ordered the chicken karage and takoyaki for the kids.  My tonkotsu ramen looked good but honestly some of the details were lacking.  The egg wasn't soft boiled, did not have the runny yoke that is traditional for Japanese ramen.  Also the ramen said chasu pork but it was a thin slice of grilled pork.  Chasu pork is a traditional soy/mirin marinated pork belly.   The pork bone broth for the tonkotsu just lacked a depth of flavor that should come from boiling those bones to release the marrow.  The noodles were the best part though as they are made in-house (always a fan of home made noodles). My wife's miso ramen was flavorful, the broth was clean and good miso taste, I personally feel miso can make up for a weaker broth.  The chicken karage and takoyaki we're home Runs for my kids who also shared our noodles.  The place is definitely worth a try, the ramen quest continues."}
{"text":"\"Have you ever had Ramen?\"
\"Well, you mean like instant noodles?\"

One of my best friends Joyce, took me here on Valentine's Day because I HAVE NEVER HAD FRESH REAL RAMEN! I could say it was a far drive from where I live, but in all honesty I could see myself there once a month, it was tasty! I got the seafood ramen and a glass of water, I don't remember how much I paid exactly but I believe it was around $12-$13 dollars with tax and not including tip, not bad for the size of the bowl that's given. It's a great atmosphere too, almost authentically Japanese. Service was good pricing wasn't too bad = good vibes and good food with good people. 

The only down fall for me is that this place is SMALL. Where I was sitting, people would pass me and they'd have to squeeze through, some purses hit me, but I was too engulfed in my ramen to really care, so eh 4/5 for me. 

Try it before you knock it!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Broth was disgusting..full of scum over boiled and never strained... awful awful... should be much cleaner... literally got the bottom crap... soo much black pepper.... and scum it wasn't edible... the pork was good but fatty... this is unfortunately bad... umami is hands down 10000% better... hit me up I know real ramen in the valley if you don't want to waste your money. All this food in the trash... and my take out is wrong.... paid extra for pork got that but didn't get the pork that comes with the actual dish... I expect some answers... I will actually waste my gas to come back in and show you how to make a proper stock and I want my money back.."}
{"text":"Ramen is not bad. The broth is little salty and maybe has some msg in it. I was very thirsty all night after eating it. They need to turn down the AC in there. We were almost sweating while eating there specially in a very hot summer night."}
{"text":"Tampopo Ramen is a relatively new ramen shop that is probably inspired by the movie of the same name.

I don't care if this place is authentic or not, it's very original and the food is extremely good. Located on McClintock and Southern, I have gone here 5 times in the past 4 months. I find it extremely warming, the quality of food is superb. I hear they make their noodles fresh, the meat is excellent and the eggs are cooked to absolute perfection.

More about the eggs: I have never tasted eggs that well-cooked so consistently. They might have used a Sous Vide method to control the yolk temperature and mastered that because the eggs have a smooth and silky yolk when you cut through the perfect white.

During my time here, I've tried a variety of different dishes. My best advice is only get the noodle soup as my friend got the rice bowl and wasn't very impressed. They add pickled ginger to all of their soups which I find kind of strange, but it's ok to eat.

Tonkatsu Ramen - This standard 8 dollar ramen is the staple of the restaurant. Has the standard stuff like the pork, nori and egg. The broth is rich and you can tell by the creamy look, that it is balanced and well prepared.
Curry Ramen - It's alright but not as good as the soup. It's basically Japanese curry stew with noodles. If you've ever had the curry blocks in Asian markets, it's pretty much that. The curry was alright, I would say even a bit cold, but I don't think I'd get this again. I think only the ramen soups for me.

Seafood Ramen- The seafood ramen includes onions, seaweed (nori), a good seafood broth, chewy fish cakes, and 3 beautifully deep fried prawns. The prawns stole the show for me because of how crispy they are. I could even eat the head but I did not want to freak out my guest. No egg in this one and I don't think I would eat regularly.

Fried Chicken - Tampopo's fried chicken reminds me a lot of Korean fried chicken which is awesome and doesn't exist in Phoenix. The chicken wings are extremely crunchy. The only disappointing thing I have with these chicken wings is that the sauce is kind of this watery soy sauce they drizzle on it. They need a thicker syrup."}
{"text":"There is no better Ramen in the phoenix area, they have gotten more consistent with their portions since when they first opened, but in the end its all about huge bombs of flavour and they haven't let me down"}
{"text":"Yummy spicy miso ramen with extra bamboo shoots and karake toppings. If you like it to be even spicier add the chili oil they have at the tables."}
{"text":"It is the worst ramen I have ever had. The pork was not prepared in the proper way at all. The seaweed salad had a very small portion."}
{"text":"Interesting fact: Tampopo means dandelion in japanese. this is a small noodle shop in the same plaza as Starbucks. For my entree I ordered spicy ramen. There wasn't a long wait for seats when we came on a Sunday afternoon.  Leaving you can see racks of noodles ready to be boiled for the ramen. 
I ordered the spicy miso ramen. My friends ordered the regular miso ramen. Their broths I tasted were pretty mild, plain an unexciting. My broth however turned out slighly better hint of spice with pork belly. The spicy miso had warming flavors, we were sad that they ran out of hirata buns to try. It would be nice if they had more appetizers. All in all it was decent for $10 but unmemorable."}
{"text":"The food is good with plentiful servings. The staff is really friendly and attentive along with good prices. Our only hitch is it is a small place and very much styled like a Japanese ramen house so if the place is busy be prepared to get friendly with the other patrons!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for good ramen! I've tried lots of places in Tempe/Phoenix and so far this is my favorite! 

Their Tonkotsu ramen has the most authentic flavor out of all their ramen. Oh man, how I missed good ramen after moving back from Japan! Now, i wont have to miss it so much ;)... 

All their appetizers are good as well! So take your pick, you won't be disappointed! 

The place is a little small. So you could have to wait a few minutes, but don't let that discourage you. I've only had to wait about 10 mins tops out of all the times I've been there. So just do yourself a favor and go check it out!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews. Seriously, I think this is my first review. But Tampopo is my go-to for THE BEST ramen in Phoenix. They have this amazing crazy hot (I think house made) chili paste for only $1 and if you like your ramen with even MORE flavor, you can opt for the super concentrated version. They also make their ramen from scratch! Look no further ramen lovers, this is your new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"When Yuko wants to try out a new ramen place, you go with her, because she knows.  Our first time here was fabulous.  I ordered everything she did (Tonkotsu ramen and gyoza), because I was in ramen training.

In an unexpected turn of events, the ramen arrived before the appetizer, but that didnt stop me from wolfing down all 6 yaki gyoja once they hit the tabletop.  The ramen was a delight, with a delicious pork belly surrounded by things, a floaty egg and my first love: noodles.  The egg was cooked perfect, with a runny yolk.

This day was extra special, because that's when I found out about kae dama... which is Korean for \"Bring me extra noodles, please\".  I dont know, maybe its Japanese.  Anyway, an extra order of noodles is only $1.50, but it takes a frickin long time, so if you think you want some, order some once they set the ramen on your table.

During my return visit, the yolk was cooked too long, but the service was UNPARALLELED!!!  George, my waiter, was outstanding.  He essentially fawned over me, explaining the process, and showing me the fancy high tech noodle making machine from Korea.  This kid has a bright future in whatever he sets his mind to, because he has a winner's attitude!"}
{"text":"I drove 40 minutes to this place expecting REAL Tonkotsu Ramen but was disappointed; the broth is  NOT authentic Japanese that has creamy color and deeper flavor. Since I live far away, I also got Miso & Curry Ramen to go and forgot about them in the fridge. Two days later, I tried to eat but ended up discarding most of them. Curry is Okay nothing special but the Miso broth(mixed with Pork soup?)changed to gooey slime with floating fat, it was disgusting! if you want to clog your arteries, this is IT."}
{"text":"Ever been to Ramen Republic or Umani, both in Tempe? This place has it's merits for sure. Their noodles are fresh egg noodle, they have a slew of toppings for ramen bowls. They have a good choice of rice bowls with yummy protein toppings. The broth is not as good as Umani for those of  you who might be comparing, but you it's much less sodium which is a good thing. Only because my roommate wasn't drinking a gallon of water afterwards. 

I ordered the pork with rice large size and added additional roasted pork on top. It was a great choice. I had a flour and diary allergy and even though I told the waiter that I couldn't have flour or diary, there was some mayo sauce on top of my pork. I skimmed it off to side because I didn't want to seem whinny and I told the waiter that I was allergic but i'll just move it to the side. He offered to remake it but I was starving as it is. 

I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 because they only had one type of noodle. Normally most noodle places will have substitutes such as flour, wheat, or rice noodle for those who can not have egg like vegans. I have an allergy to egg as well so as much as I wanted to try the ramen, I couldn't. 

There's always something on the menu to eat and I found it. It was delicious and my roommate enjoyed his bowl of ramen with roast pork. Just a heads up for those who can't have egg and ask before you order if you have a allergy to be safe."}
{"text":"So we traveled from Glendale to Tempe a 40min drive to try this place. The decore was nice and I like how you can see the open kitchen but it was a really small place. They made the most of the space they were given but the set up was all wrong. On to the food, so we ordered the tonkastsu ramen which is what we always order when going to a Ramen place. Here it was ok. The Meat wasn't as tender as we are used to and the broth was lacking that saltiness and the soup spoon didn't seem like a soup spoon at all but a wooden flat utensil that has no purpose. I'll just have to wait for another place to attempt to do Ramen that is worth a 40min drive."}
{"text":"super oily and lacked in flavor the times I've gone through. the noodles were very dry when we got them. 

the place was a weird vibe filled with all hipster kids serving and 90's-2000. rap music? very interesting choice for a ramen place if you ask me. 

also got a fruit fly in my ice for my canned drink, poured my drink in and my husband noticed it. Asked for a drink replacement and was charged for it. 

probably won't be back ever"}
{"text":"Finally, a true authentic Japanese-style ramen house in the valley. I have long been waiting for someone to  open a restaurant like this. I still wonder why it took so long to do so. If you read the Yelp reviews so far, it is obvious there is a huge demand for ramen.

We had a group of 11 dined on Saturday at 6:30PM.  I'm glad I made a reservation. I figured the restaurant would be tiny as most ramen restaurants are.  They have a long table in the middle of the restaurant to accommodation large groups, a few 2-4 seat tables, and seating around the open kitchen similar to your sushi bar.  Apparently, we were the first large group they had since opened.  When we first arrived, the waiters came by quickly and gave us water and just 4 menus. They either were short on menus or the just can't count. It was difficult to get their attention after that. I knew from there on it was going to be a really long night. We ended up sharing the menus.  

We ordered the apps and main entrees at the same time. Later, the waiter came back stating they were out of regular ramen and only have the spicy ones left. Ok, a few of us changed to rice bowls and a few wanted to try the spicy. I ordered the curry chicken with spicy ramen. Oh, the noodle was spicy but bearable. I wouldn't recommend for the kiddos or anyone that can't handle the heat. My dish must have been sitting on the counter for a while. Lukewarm curry don't really mix. Although the noodle was spicy, it still tasted fresh and good chewy texture. The curry tasted bland, but the spicy noodle sort of balanced in the curry. Hint hint. 
Noodles and dumplings all made from scratch and in-house by a special machine. It's serious business here, a room just to showcase that special machine and probably watch them making the noodles. They even have one of my favorite street snacks, takoyaki (octopus balls)!  

After 30 minutes, one side of our group already finished their dishes while the other side was still waiting the food and apps. We noticed the people after we ordered all got their food, ate, and left.  The Waiter kept telling us the kitchen was behind. After another 15 minutes gone by, we all finally got our food except for one. 

I understand there always kinks with brand new restaurants. The Owner came out a couple of times to apologize for the mistakes and even offered us drinks. He indicated when the Waiter changed our order the ticket was pushed back towards the end. The kitchen and front staff were so overwhelmed with orders which just not prepared for that night. After we all paid and was hanging out in the front of the restaurant, the Waiter rushed out stating one of the credit cards was charged with another customer's bill. Huh? 

After a week or so, all my friends who charged under their credit cards noticed a refund on their statements.  Apparently, the Owner must have reversed all the charges for that night. He didn't have to do that. No doubt, he is genuine in the Japanese values. This certainly will be my go-to place when I crave for ramen!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! We went for lunch and it was a bit packed. We didn't have to wait too long for a spot though. I got the ultra spicy ramen and my boyfriend got the spicy miso ramen. We also ordered the Takoyaki. Everything came out quickly. The Takoyaki was very tasty and a good size. The ramen was a good portion as well. The ultra spicy ramen wasn't too spicy for me (I eat a lot of spicy foods so my tolerance is higher than normal). They both had very good and strong tastes. The service was excellent and responsive. I would call ahead if you're in a big group, the biggest table is community seating (which basically means there's a large table and strangers are sat together)."}
{"text":"Braised pork belly appetizer was awesome..  lil small portion  size but ohh so tasty.. 

spicy miso ramen.  great flavor,  n just the right amount of heat..  the egg wa lil runny in inside,  perfection.  best ramen i have had in long time. 

tonkatsu ramen,  also great flavor close to yakisoba flavor,  egg same runny,  we will be back soon.. 

place closes from 3 till 5, as we learned hard way.  seating is a little cramped,  but well worth it for the food.  chefs and wait staff very friendly.. great job.."}
{"text":"I don't know much about \"authentic\" ramen but hot damn. This place is amazing. The noodles were prepared perfectly; chewy and delicious. Make sure to add the concentrated broth if you're into that type of thing because it increased the flavor and silky thickness which put it over the top. This will forever be my designated ramen spot from here on out. This was my first time & definitely not the last!"}
{"text":"Maybe to others I would be considered an inexperienced ramen eater. I've never enjoyed ramen in Japan, California, or New York. But I don't think that really matters. What matters when you go out to eat is... 1, did you enjoy your food? 2, did anyone working at the place do something to intentionally piss you off? And 3, did it cost more than it was worth?

For Tampopo Ramen, I answer those questions thusly: 1, yes, very. 2, no, everyone was courteous and friendly. And 3, no, I felt I paid a fair price for my meal.

Some of the reviews written about this place raise a lot of questions in my brain. What are these people like? Are they hard to please? Rude? Or are they reasonable people who experienced a bad side of the business I wasn't exposed to? 

I don't have answers to those questions, only speculations. And ultimately, that doesn't matter. My advice is don't let those bad reviews influence your decision to come here. I can honestly say I enjoyed the food and that none of the staff was rude or inattentive. 

Anyway, with that off my chest...

I've ordered the tonkotsu ramen, no add-ons, and the ramen curry. Both were very good, but I enjoyed the tonkotsu more. To me, the flavor of the broth was just right. I also loved the taste and texture of the fresh noodles, and I thought the egg was cooked to perfection (somewhere inbetween soft and hard boiled). I don't understand the complaints with this dish, I thought it was excellent. To me, the ramen from Republic Ramen and Cherryblossom pales in comparison. 

I look forward to coming back and trying all the different varieties here."}
{"text":"So good. Wish it was closer to our house! Small inside but very good food and they have sake."}
{"text":"A ramen shop should have good ramen, with deep and complex broth. This broth was shallow and bland. Wanted it to be good, but kept thinking, seriously... you feel good about this? The takoyaki and gyoza were above average (for Phoenix), and the bottled beer was cold, though."}
{"text":"The wings were terrible. They were over cooked. How can fried chicken just be bones. Those wings were sorry. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend is on a ramen kick.  So we decided to try this place because it was close and the place that introduced us to ramen was closed.  Well, I won't be coming back.  

I ordered the tonkontsu ramen,  just so I was able to compare.  The broth was rich but i think it's because I paid the extra for \"rich soup\" which is basically a concentrated broth. The pork was not tender and the egg was overcooked.  

The establishment itself is smaller than a group exercise room.  So it's not very comfortable to enjoy your meal.  So on the hunt we continue."}
{"text":"A friend and I had a lunch date and it was packed on a Saturday...

PROS
-Octopus bowl appetizer - tried something new and had a strange but cool texture, it was fried on the outside but a little softer in the middle. There were shavings of something one top that freaked me out a little, but still taste. 6 of them to share in the app.
-eggs in both dishes were cooked really well
-we were please w/the slice of pork in our ramen - a lot more flavor and carmelized than other places in AZ

CONS
-Service was slow, we asked for plates multiple times for our app
-Broth - for both the spicy miso and Tonkatsu...there was no flavor...my friend said his was not spicy at all it just looked spicy...i had to add all these different flavorings from the table and was still not satisfied with it fully

It was just an average ramen place. Is it better than Republic Ramen in Tempe? Yes, but I have yet to find an above average ramen place in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago after my fave ramen place Umami in tempe closed down.  It's a cute little place where they make the noodles right in the restuarant. I walked in and ordered to go and I was happy they actually had separated the noodles, broth, and all the toppings to assemble myself at home so nothing got soggy or over saturated. Everything was very tasty and i'll definitely be back, loved it :)"}
{"text":"Recently we had the opportunity to have lunch here and all of us were quite impressed. Mind you you the only knowledge I have about Ramen is the highly salted store bought varieties. I ordered the Spicy Miso with extra pork and the flavor and seasonings were perfect. The half egg was also cooked just right with the yolk not too hard. The portion size was more than I could eat so I had leftovers for later. The place is small but clean and well managed. This is must visit for those of you that like Ramen. Kudos to the staff for their excellent service. I'll be back but that's not a threat, lol."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say it. This is hands down the best ramen ever! No joke! I've been here so many times and I'm still in love with it. And of course the days i want to go it's closed. 

The soymilk ramen is for vegetarians and it has tonkotsu broth with soymilk. It has white onions, bean sprouts, yellow and red peppers, scallions and sesame. and of course to add on a crap ton of spicy oil in it. 

The waiters here are so accommodating and very friendly. 

It's very tiny in here. You share a whole row with random people. But I'm fine with that. Haha. 

Why must you locate sooo far. Open one in central Phoenix. That would be awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months and I understand it was a new business. So the customer service and food was good and bad on and off. 

Today.. the service and the ramen was actually wonderful! Great improvement on everything! My ramen came out in a timely manner and our server definitely got us everything we needed, and checked up on us a few times  it's super busy right now so that's a sign that the cooks and servers are working super hard! Thanks !"}
{"text":"Most authentic ramen I've had! The spicy miso ramen is amazing! I also love that they make their own noodles! The portion is more than enough, I usually can't finish it all. I've been I twice now and it's been good both times! I suggest adding th braised pork belly, it is so delicious! I also really love the soft boiled egg that comes in the soup.

For apps, the gyoza was delicious, but this last time I ordered the Japanese fried chicken, which was ok, but kind of bland. It came with a little dish of what I think was garlic salt, which made the chicken way too salty when I dipped it. I asked the server what I was supposed to do with it, and he said he wasn't sure either... So, oh well, I just won't order it again.

The drink options are kinda slim, but sufficient. I think they could add a fountain machine and more than 1 tap beer option.

It's worth coming back for the ramen though, best I've had in AZ so far!!"}
{"text":"Karaage was really good As well as the spicy miso! I had a bite of soy one too all very delicious"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on 12/16/15.  Very poor service.  Ordered two appetizers.  Never did receive the second.  Waited for 45 minutes for our ramen.  Noodles were exalted as fresh made on premise.  Not good flavor and tough.  Broth of ramen was not good flavor either plus had the appearance of very dirty water.  It was not the appearance nor the good flavor we have had at Clever Koi nor Hana's in Phoenix nor what we have had in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Mediocre tonkotsu. I had it several months ago and apologize for being scant on details. This review is more a reminder to myself!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place after finding out they make their own noodles with their super fancy machine thing but had a similar experience to many other Yelper's.

We came on a Friday night at the hungry hour (7 PM) and were able to get in no problem.  The place is small, has some single tables, but is mostly family style long shared tables or shared space at the kitchen bar.  We sat at the kitchen bar which got a little cramped once more people arrived.

?We sampled the Gyoza and each got ?Tonkatsu ramen.  The Boy got the spicy noodles and I opted for the rich/concentrated broth, I also added corn and pork belly.  Everything, while well done and delicious, just didn't work together.  My broth was good, but not amazing.  The portions were just ok as well, one small slice of pork in my dish and the upgrade to add corn for $2 was super tiny.  I didn't get whole lot for the up charges to add items to the Ramen.

Not all was bad though, The Boy loved the seasoned egg and the pork belly was good.  I do recommend adding Roasted Pork vs Pork belly.  The roasted pork was amazing, a little on the fatty side, but had a lot of great flavor.  Another plus, the peanut oil has been removed from the dishes making it a safe for those with allergies to partake.

Now can we talk about the weird spoon?  I am all about flare and authenticity but it was so awkward to use.  I am a small girl and the thing was the size of my arm.  Couple that with the cramped space of the shared table, it was just difficult to use."}
{"text":"Amazing. Started off with takoyaki, best takoyaki in town that ive had. I got the seafood rmen with 2 dried nor. Thin noodles good options for spice. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite ramen shops in the Tempe area. The menu is very simple, especially with the ramen, but there's still room to try new things or customize your order. I have tried both the tonkotsu ramen and the miso ramen, while my boyfriend has tried their ultra spicy ramen. Their miso ramen has a lot more depth of flavor to it compared to their tonkotsu broth, and my boyfriend said that their ultra spicy is LEGIT (and this is the kind of person who can eat ghost peppers). Their braised pork belly is also an excellent addition to ramen, but I've yet to try it donburi style with rice. Extra toppings add up so just be mindful of that when ordering."}
{"text":"I was craving something delicious and warm and found this place . I must say I have ate at my fair share of pho and ramen places but this place is awesome ! The flavor of the soup was amazing! We got the tonkotsu ramen I highly recommend this one ! I added bamboo and spice to mine . I will be back amazing food and service !"}
{"text":"Really LOVE their ramen! Tried the signature Tonkotsu ramen and found it amazingly delicious. Unlike other tonkotsu ramen, the soup here adds some sesame flavor and more creamy. In addition, the pork belly is grilled - crispy, but also juicy, which is quite different from others. My friends had the \"ultra spicy ramen\" and \"spicy miso ramen.\" They both liked their ramen, especially the soup."}
{"text":"I have to be honest here, I cant even lie about it even if I tried. The food is awful. My sister and I came in and ordered three appetizers: agadashi tofu, japanese chicken wings, and gyoza. We asked our waitress if the gyoza is hand made or store bought and she had the audacity to lie in front of my face saying its hand made. I tried it and it is the most common purchased gyoza at your local lee lee oriental super market. My god.. Each of the appetizers were 7$ and the portion is ridiculous as well as the taste. The chicken wing tasted like its been put into the fryer and someone dripped some soy sauce on it. The tofu is not a normal agadashi tofu size and it taste bland and under fried. The worst part was the ramen... I got the signature tonkatsu ramen and double meat. Thats my biggest mistake of the night. I always taste the broth first as it is the indicator to how good the ramen will be. And it taste like aged water... The noodle was alright and the pork tasted like burnt shit. I would highly not recommend this place. The only time i can see someone giving this place more than a 2 star is when that person had poverty standards. Oh.. Im giving this place a 1 star because even the service was terrible. Never a refill or taken any of the appetizer plates away. Good luck"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I came here with a friend from out of town who happens to be a vegetarian. We sat at the bar and enjoyed fairly good service (our food did sit in the window for a bit, and I was tempted to just go grab it, but I refrained). I was excited to try this place, as my go to ramen establishment just closed to relocate (umami) and I am currently ramenless. I ordered the super extra spicy ramen and my friend had the only vegetarian option which was a soy milk based ramen. The workers were nice enough to put his pork on the side so I could eat it. Anyway, the ramen came out and was a bit small for the price (9-10$). Each dish only came with one piece of pork that was mostly fat. The parts of the pork that were not fat did taste good. The ramen was served with giant odd wooden spoons that were difficult to eat with due to the cup portion being mostly flat. The flavor of my ramen was good, spicy, but not too spicy. The noodles also were tasty, and I appreciate that they are made in house. The best part of the ramen was the egg.... it was just slightly soft in the middle and added a lot of flavor to the soup. My friend's vegetarian ramen was not so good. It tasted a bit like alfredo sauce and really nothing like ramen. It had some peppers in it that were still very crunchy and didn't taste like they had been in the soup at all. This was pretty disappointing. Anyway, I would suggest that this restaurant look into making a soy based broth that mimics traditional ramen as an option for vegetarians. Additionally, I feel that their prices should be lower OR they should fill the bowl and maybe give (gasp) two slices of pork.... it just wasn't enough to justify the price. I may give this establishment another shot and hopefully it will get better as time goes on."}
{"text":"This place is great. Not only is the ramen great but it's close to my work! 

I found them on yelp and my co worker and I wanted to try them one day. I always get the Tonkatsu ramen and add the pork belly and corn to it. They give a very good portion of meat and I really enjoy the broth. I think that their noodles are kind of thin. I like my noodles a little thicker for my ramen. Other then that I really enjoy everything else, and it's a very good size bowl. Their prices are reasonable and customer service is always good. The restaurant is small, but a comfortable size."}
{"text":"WOW!  My husband and I come here very often! The staff is very friendly the cooks are nice, they always say hello and goodbye when coming through the door. 

we always try to order different things to try them out, so far everything has been delicious. 
we love the friend octopus balls, we always get this as an appetizer!

Ramen bowls come in large portions, rice bowls are delicious, you can order small or large. we always get small and its enough for one person. 
 Prices are good, cheap and delicious food. 
We get the fried octopus balls, and two small rice bowls and its under $20  

Love coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Good for some basic tonkotsu ramen carvings. 

Since I am a fan of thick noodles so this hits the spot."}
{"text":"We were eager to try out the new ramen place. Apparently many others were curious about it, too, because it was crowded for lunch at 2:00 on a weekday.

Highlights: The \"hard boiled egg\" was perfectly soft-boiled. The noodles and broth were OK. (Sorry, that's the end of the highlights.)

Disappointments:
 - It's a small, cramped and awkward to walk through.
 - Service was very, very slow. They really need to work on that.
 - I had the tonkatsu with shrimp. The shrimp arrived intact, including eyeballs. I had to dissect them with my fingers and a napkin. Finally achieving that, I found them to be overcooked and rubbery.
 - What is with the slab of pork in a dish to be eaten with chopsticks? Sorry, but it's just a pain. If it was tender, one could pick it up with the chopsticks and bite it, but it was also overcooked and tough. Like with the shrimp - I like soup that's actually ready to eat. 
 - Also, what's up with the wooden soup spoons? Looks like a ladle, and you have to hold the handle above your head to sip the teaspoon that it actually holds. Really.

Not recommended. Not going back."}
{"text":"First time at Tampopo tonight.  I tried the spicy miso to-go, which was very good.  I wish there had been a bit more meat in it, but the flavor was good and I was very pleased with my choice.  I tried the buns as a side, which had a good taste but I wish again had a little more meat.  

I am giving a five star rating because the service was very good.  The food was probably worthy of a 4-star rating but I was very pleased with the help of the girl at the counter.  The restaurant was PACKED, I was shocked how busy it was on a Thursday night.  The girl who took my order was kind enough to bring my food out to me in my car so that I could stay in the car with my kids.  Very kind of her to do when the restaurant was so busy!

The fresh noodles were great, will be going back!

UPDATE:
Went back for a second try with my daughter.  Service again was excellent and the restaurant wasn't as crazy busy at lunchtime.  Had the ultra spicy and added shrimp.  I certainly wouldn't say that it was ultra spicy but it was still delicious.  

I know everyone posts about those octopus balls... I didn't really care for them.  Potstickers were very fresh and delicious!  My daughter loved the fried chicken and rice."}
{"text":"Solid ramen, wasn't the best or worst I've had but I haven't had much ramen in my life. They do ramen from the Hakata region and they make their noodles in-house, which is quite cool. I got my usual spicy miso ramen, but after trying someone else's tonkotsu, I think that might have been tastier. Also, big mistake in not getting the pork belly. I tried my cousin's and it melted in my mouth...but really, who am I kidding? I'm a slut for all bellies, especially pork. The egg in my ramen was a bit overdone, but my brother's was about right. The egg could also have used more marinating, in my opinion. We also got a steamed bun as an appetizer--there was wayyyy too much sauce, which overwhelmed the other flavors for me.

The space is a bit cramped and the seating is not the easiest to sit in and maneuver. You might have to wait a bit to be seated (especially if your party is large), but there's a Starbucks right next door if your wait is bad."}
{"text":"Great ramen I tasted in like 2 years! I lived in Japan for 17 years and the ramen I ate was delicious. It's not expensive at all so I would definitely go there quite often"}
{"text":"Best ramen joint I've had in Arizona by far. Lives in Okinawa so I've been searching for ramen that tasted similar and this is the closest. Would definitely recommend the ultra spicy ramen."}
{"text":"If you feel like you can't find anything comparable to the best ramen spots in LA, well you've found the place.  Tampopo was amazing! We got to sit at the bar, and even though it was pretty packed (a rainy day makes for a good bowl of ramen) we didn't feel neglected, or crowded by the other like minded individuals who need a bowl of that soul-warming stuff.  From the broth, to the noodles, to the chasu... just yum!  Oh and we asked for a side of the pork belly, oh sweet baby Jesus!! The. It's delicious thing ever tasted.  Forget all other noodle places... this is the spot- well for Ramen."}
{"text":"I have had ramen here in Arizona, in San Jose, in San Francisco, and all over Japan. When the sushi place closed I was pretty bummed, but I cheered up when I learned that it would be a ramen shop. The only thing was the name. Tampopo? Wow. That's making a BOLD statement! Given the name, I went in for lunch today with the bar set pretty high. I ordered the basic ramen because there is no chili oil and no add-ins to hide behind. It was amazing! The noodles had great texture and the broth was flavorful without relying on a ton of salt. 

Unfortunately, I had to get back to work so I didn't have time for seconds. I could have easily put away another bowl or two.  I'm not saying portions were small because they aren't...it's just that good!

I am very happy that I live around the corner!"}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD. 

Went here because I was craving Asian comfort food, and what better place to treat your cravings than at a ramen shop?? The place is a little crammed and small, so try to come here during the lunch and dinner off-hours. 

I ordered their curry ramen, which is a dish I have never seen before, and it was absolutely delightful! I also tried their fried octopus balls and with the sauce, it is absolutely fantastic! The only problem I have about this place is that there are not many options on their menu, so I don't know if I would come here again, unless I want their curry ramen again."}
{"text":"With recommendation from foodie friends, I have come to this place to check out their famous Ramen.  The presentation was decent and I saw the master chef put his huge bone marrow into the broth to my delight.  The problems came with mostly services.  She has very little idea when to clear the table and kept on asking me am I done (twice) which I feel like she wants to confiscate my soup.  The right way to ask is If I am still working on it instead.  The soup was underseasoned broth so I had to enhance with Japanese chili oil, spices, and caviar.  The agedashi tofu broth is improper (light soy sauce expected instead of eel soy sauce)..Tacoyaki is great but with too much dry fish which covered the flavors of octopus balls.  I will have to go back for others and evaluate others and see if I will return.  My status with this place is still pending.."}
{"text":"A family run Ramen shop serving handmade noodle with a good complex broth. The kitchen shows Ramen experience that I haven't seen in Phoenix before. They have Asahi Super Dry on tap and a good selection of sake.. it's the real deal and worth a try."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town! I got the Tonkatsu ramen with the pork belly. I asked for their spicy red paste. Word to the wise, it is pretty spicy. The space is a bit small so if youre a big party expect a wait. I wish it was open later for those late night cravings."}
{"text":"Quality ramen! Great Pork. I tried the Spicy.. it is Very spicy!! Worth it and I will be back to try some more options on the menu. Ryan was our server he took great care of us. Great first visit!"}
{"text":"Highly, highly disappointed with this place. This was the first place that I visited when I landed in Arizona and I was extremely excited due to the reviews and their super spicy ramen with spicy noodles. However, their super spicy ramen was not spicy at all and it was bland. It's also overpriced & any meat or add ins you want to the ramen costs extra $. In addition, the place is very small and cramped. Needless to say, if I ever return to Arizona, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in the Phoenix area. I got the Spicy Miso Ramen and I highly highly recommend it. Especially with the weather a little cooler, there is nothing better. :) the broth is so flavorful and filling in a good way."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall place is so crowded inside, It literally felt like I was packed like sardines. The chairs are so close together, we had to keep our elbows in as we slurped on our noodles. 

The noodles are made in house and was absolutely delicious. The consistency and texture was spot on. The broth wasn't overly salted which was big relief. 

We tried three different ramens. The tonkatsu was my favorite in terms of broth and toppings. The soft boiled egg was seasoned well and was very satisfying. Consider ordering extra for added protein. 

The spicy miso had korean gochujang flavor mixed in with miso. It was funky for me but my son seemed to enjoy it. The ultra spicy ramen comes with spicy broth as well as spice infused noodles making this dish extra spicy. However, the broth (I should say 'sauce' because it was really thick) had again gochujang and tobasco flavor which was really strange combo and didn't taste right. Hubby didn't care for this dish either. Again, tonkatsu ramen was very good. 

The takoyaki was delicious but it was on super soft/mushy side. It was seasoned well too. 

Overall, the cramped seatings took away from the experience. I would go back for the food."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very attentive. Although seating was limited, I liked the intimate environment of the restaurant. Bowls were quite large, with a neat wooden spoon that came on the side. The noodles were very delicious as well as the broth (which can get pretty spicy)."}
{"text":"I had been searching for another ramen place aside from Republic Ramen, but I had always run across ramen shops that were less than par, but Tachibana exceeded my expectations --  especially with the taste of their char siu!! Holy moly their char siu!!!!! It's so good and so flavorful! It is SO worth the extra $ for extra char siu in your ramen. I have yet to try their other dishes, but I can't seem to get away from the char siu tonkotsu ramen.... And I LOVE the name! Tampopo (or dandelion) was a popular movie in Japan back in 1985 -- it is a comedy drama that takes place at the decrepit ramen shop, Tampopo. Anyway, this Tampop is worth the drive from southwest Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The spicy miso ramen was great. The spice is very mild, so if you like a kick, try the ultra spicy. I added kakuni (pork belly) to my ramen which was well seasoned and tender. 

The restaurant is a small very casual spot with Japanese flare. they have attentive service and very good oolong hot tea. 

Perfect for a chilly day or when you're feeling under the weather."}
{"text":"Fact:  Justin Timberlake's hair in the 1990's was an unintentional advertisement for instant ramen.

More like subliminal messages.  Amirite?

Anyways, three of us came here for dinner on a lovely chilly Thursday night.  We were seated at the bar, front row seats to the magic noodle show [get your mind outta the gutter!] by an informative and cheerful waiter.  The three of us got a variety of items to share with each other.  We had ordered two Tako Wasabis, two Hirata Buns, an Agedashi Tofu, Tonkatsu Ramen with the rich soup upgrade, a Miso Ramen, and an Ultra Spicy Ramen.  Boy am I bloated.

Let's talk appetizers:  I originally wanted to get my beloved Takoyaki but the Takowasabi caught my eye.  I never had it before so I was mildly surprised when we received two martini glasses full of raw octopus with fresh wasabi and pickled ginger.  Any time a place has fresh wasabi, I'm all for it but man was it pungent!  That first bite packed a punch.  Like the Takowasabi was Holly Holm and I was Ronda Rousey.  I loved the raw octopus but that sour pucker from the ginger and the burning sensation from the fresh wasabi was pretty intense.  I wish the server told us that one ordered would have been enough for the three of us because we didn't even finish the second glass.  Next we had the Hirata Buns [steamed pork belly buns].  I assumed they would serve it like this place we went to in Las Vegas this past Saturday which is $3 for one bun.  Since only two of us wanted it, had I known they were served in pairs, we would have gotten just one order.  Granted, they give you two buns for $3 but they're relatively small.  I could have done without this because it didn't seem like they steamed the buns at all.  They were cold and cracking and not warm and squishy.  It made the first bite unpleasant.  I also wish there was an option to get regular Kewpie mayo instead of the spicy mayo.  The spicy mayo was delicious for sure but there was too much going on.  Kewpie mayo is more delicate and I think it's perfect for pork belly.  As for the Agedashi Tofu, these were good but not as crispy as I would have liked it.

Now I'm not going to get into all the different kinds of ramen we had in great detail but I will say that they were all pretty darn good.  We were informed that Tampopo has one of ten ramen pulling machines in the U.S.  They are the ONLY ones in Arizona with this contraption.  The noodles were cooked al-dente.  They held the delicious soup well and had great texture.  Any time a noodle can hold up the broth and flavor is a win in my book.  I also love how you can not only see the collagen floating in the broth but feel it sticking to your lips which is no easy feat as I had lipstick on.  The Rich Soup Upgrade (+$1) had a great amount of pepper I wasn't anticipating despite reading Yuko H.'s review but I didn't mind it that much.  I will admit that I wish the eggs were more runny.  I want to crack my egg in half and have the yolk turn my broth into more richness.  The cha shu was a bit on the tougher side as well.  I like my cha shu a little more fatty for the melt-in-your-mouth feel.

All in all, I had a pretty great meal.  I would love to try their Takoyaki and Curry Ramen next time.  Hands down a great ramen experience in Arizona.  I wish you great success, Tampopo!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend ramen shop probably one of the best ramens I've tasted. I recommend the Miso Ramen its amazing."}
{"text":"Disgusting ramen. If you ever have any other Japanese ramen, you will know their broth is disgusting. Don't go there, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Try the ramen at tempopo for first time. The food are good. But 2 things I got point out. The soup spoon are bit hard to used to and those chairs, are definitely not most comfortable to sit on for long extended time."}
{"text":"First time eating authentic ramen. Ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen with Rich Soup and did not regret it at all. Excellent food and server was very friendly. Over all great impression."}
{"text":"I was solo every time I visited here for conference in Phoenix. Considering it was Sundays, they were not crowded. Overall, Taste is not bad but the service was below expectation. Pork belly (chashu) is always burnt (not glazed with fire) and you get burnt black particles in your soup, (making hard to sip a soup without eating burnt particles together. ) One time they forgot to add an egg and delivered in my table separately but I didn't even tell them I was missing an egg (tamago). How did they find out later? The other time they almost served my foods on the table and took it away, saying oops,it was not mine. And they greet you when you come in but not when you leave. I would say they lack consistency in taste and service in general."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday after seeing a show at Gammage. We were in the mood for ramen but Unami was closed. The restaurant is very small but has a sleek modern look. The service was honestly not so good. Everyone was very nice however, we ordered an appetizer and it just never came! We had to ask for water and then waited a while to receive the water. When we were clearly done with the meal no one came over for several minutes. 

The taste of the ramen was very good and that is why this place gets 3 stars! I just wish the service was better!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I love their cream soda! My boyfriend I got two. Mango and melon and it was it was fantastic. Ramen was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Tampopo is awesome. Being from New York City, it's a bit harder to come by authentic foods in Phoenix. This is my go to whenever I want to feel like I'm back home. Food is delicious. Once you have the Ultra Spicy Rain you can't go back! Also discovered the Kakuni Don (Braised Pork Belly over White Rice with a little side of Spicy Crab Mix. Perfection. Apps and sake selections are good as well."}
{"text":"There is a reason why I drive from the west valley to Tampopo for ramen. One bowl of ramen from this place fills my soul. 

The Good:
-Ramen is why you come here. Home-made noodles and be sure to add kakuni to your ramen (Stellar!) I'm a tonkotsu type of guy so I always get either the original or ultra-spicy tonkotsu ramen.
-If you dont want ramen then the teriyaki chicken bowl is a good choice.
-Appetizers I normally get that are really good are the gyoza, hirata buns, and shisito peppers.

Bottom line; for me this is the best ramen shop in the valley. I have been to a lot of really good ones but there is a reason i keep coming back. If you haven't tried Tampopo yet what are you waiting for?? (I mean it....go now!)"}
{"text":"The noodles were way too chewy (more than normal ramen) and never softened in the broth. The broth was tepid, not warm enough. The pork was good but not nearly enough to overcome the weak base. And this is just a side note, but seriously people - $7 for a draft pint of Sapporo at a strip mall joint with six two-tops and bar ramen service?"}
{"text":"This has to be the most authentic ramen joint I have ever been to. Lucky for me, it's close to home! It's a small place with family style seating in the center and a few small tables alongside the wall. We opted for the bar seating to check out the making of it all. The braised pork is TO. DIE. FOR. Seriously, like what did they put in there...crack!? Love. Both of our dishes were glorious and perfectly spicy. If you haven't been here, it's worth the try!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good, totally blew our minds.  Excellent ramen, homemade noodles and buns really make it outstanding.  Gyozo was fantastic too. So far every single dish has been totally delicious. We have been there twice in one week!!!"}
{"text":"Tampopo offers a \"soymilk only\" broth for their vegetarian customers. It's completely unlike any ramen I've ever tasted before, but not in a good way. I'd almost describe it as a \"dairy-drowned ramen\" that's more reminiscent of an overly wet fettucini alfredo than the Japanese brothy wonder we know and love. Their non-vegetarian options looked and smelled fantastic, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll eventually figure out a better vegetarian option. Until then, though, definitely not recommended for the vegetarian crowd. One star added back for noodles that were admittedly pretty damn good, even if they happened to be drowned in a deluge of dairy."}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Good ramen. Just try it."}
{"text":"Tampopo serves good ramen (for Arizona).  You can see that they make the noodles in-house.

We started with the hirata bun which was good but not great.  The bread to filling ratio was too high, and the cold bun wasn't soft and fresh.  I had the tonkotsu ramen which came with sprouts, mushrooms, soft boiled egg, and a slice of pork.  I added fried chicken or karrage (more like nuggets).  The broth was a bit bland.  Serving size was generous.

It looks busy from the outside, but just go in and request a seat.  They usually can seat you quickly because the communal table is adaptable to adding/removing patrons."}
{"text":"With the weather being so cold lately I've really been craving some good ramen. I had heard mention of this place and have been meaning to stop in. Today was the perfect opportunity to grab lunch. 

I was greeted right away by staff and asked to see a to go menu. The host asked me if I had been in or if I would like any recommendations to their menu. His suggestion (since I like spicy) was the spicy miso ramen bowl which had the most tender pork, bean sprouts, green onion, delicious ginger, and I believe bamboo. 

Their ramen hit the spot!! The noodles were a fantastic texture & not over dons, absolutely perfect for my preference. While it was probably enough to share, I devoured the all of it on my own. I will definitely be back to this place and can't wait to try the hirata buns!"}
{"text":"We are Super-fans of this adorable and delicious indulgence.  The broth is unrivaled in my experience and the pork belly is a must add.  Since we discovered it, we speak of it in hushed eager tones of longing.  Thank you Tampopo for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Busy on a Friday night but good turnover and you get served really fast.  Went basic for my first try with the Tonkotsu and spicy cod roe.  Delicious!  Can't wait to return and try more options."}
{"text":"I really love this place and would have given it a 5 star but my recent experience, the people weren't so friendly or welcoming. Right when we got in we waited to be seated and no one attended us for a while. Then a worker passes by and says excuse me to pass through rather than greeting us and saying someone will be with us shortly. Later on another worker comes to seat us. RATHER THAN GREETING US AGAIN... she only asks just for two?? No one ever said hi or any sort. I love this place but their service isn't so friendly."}
{"text":"Typically, I am not a stumbler - but I stumbled into Tampopo Ramen by pure coincidence, or divine order, or whatever after a Saturday shopping at Superstition Ranch Market in Mesa. Yes, I was aware of this place thanks to Yelp! (thanks, Yelp), and I did intend to visit so maybe it's just a happy accident. We had the spicy miso ramen and the tonkatsu ramen, both were excellent. Now, after reading some of the reviews, I concur that the spicy miso ramen is not very spicy at all - others seem to have had this experience too. Good news - there is a caddy of soy sauce, spicy chili oil, and a shaker of spicy hot seasoning at every table. Also, I have to mention the neat gizmo with a crank on it at every table: a sesame seed grinder/shaker that works almost like a pepper grinder except with sesame seeds. Genius! I was so hungry I forgot to take a pic beforehand...but I certainly captured the aftermath. Very cool wooden spoons with the soup. Four stars because it felt like forever to get the food, but it was delicious, and I want to return to try a few of the other items. Otherwise, the place was clean, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the vibe was upbeat and they were doing brisk business which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"Busy Ramen Restaurant on a Sunday afternoon.  A few tables for 2 with one long community table and Ramen bar seats along where the cooks prepare the food.

Ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen, Miso Ramen, Chicken Teriyaki,  Chicken Wings, Gyozas and Peking Duck style appetizer. 

I would recommend the Tonkatsu Ramen, the Peking Duck style appetizer and the gyozas.

Was told the you could upgrade to rich soup base which I did not know.

The service was good considering how many people there were in the restaurant.

Will come back and try the rich soup base"}
{"text":"So good!! Ordered the spicy miso added mushroom. Just a little heat we also ordered the Japanese fried chicken and rice and dumplings. We loved everything!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place in Arizona! Everything I've tried has been really good but my favorite is probably the tonkotsu ramen. Flavorful broth, handmade(!) noodles, and great toppings. The takoyaki was very tasty, too. Service is reasonably fast even during peak lunch hours. 

My only minor quibble is that their seasoned egg is not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Just when I almost gave up the idea of having any good ramen noodles in the states of Arizona ...BAM! This restaurant is here. Last time I had ramen noodle was in LA and it terrified me from having it again. The broth was super salty that I couldn't taste anything else. But then....all of my yelper friends check in here and finally I decided to give this a try. 

This restaurant isn't big, but it was full house this afternoon. Usually a indication of a good restaurant. We were lucky to find a small section of the table for the 4 of us. It took someone a while to clean up the table and to bring us menus. No matter - it is a brand new restaurant and they were crazy busy. Drink and food did take a while and they also forgot one of our appetizers. No one really came by to check up on us once. Nevertheless, the overall service was acceptable. 

We ordered a Pork Bun and pork belly as an appetizer. The dough was super soft on the pork bun. The portion for pork belly was very small and a bit salty. Meat was tender and I did enjoy it. For entree, I ordered Miso ramen noodle (regular flavor). The broth was sweet and tasty. Unlike the saltiness that I had when I was in LA. The noodle was super fresh and I couldn't have enough of it. 

I'll definitely come back here again to try different appetizer, ramen noodles and make more room for dessert. Thanks for opening up such a great place in Arizona."}
{"text":"The good:
This place has some of the best takoyaki in the state, if I come back with friends this will be what I get. It was crispy on the outside and not too gooey on the inside which can be a problem with this dish. 

The bad:
I was not as fond of the Ramen, the noodles are pretty chewy, the actual flavor of the pork is good but it is unfortunately dry. The broth was either too salty (in the case of my friend) or not salty enough like mine. Mine was good but not the best, unfortunately my friend's was too salty because of the addition of the burdock (some kind of thick paste was added along with it) to the point that she threw up after. Not a good way to end the night."}
{"text":"The best ramen place I have tried so far in Phoenix. The service is fast and people are friendly. Gyoza is cooked the right way."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I ordered the curry noodles.  I never enjoyed curry so much, I felt I had to report this..incredible.."}
{"text":"When I go for ramen, this is where I go. I get the same thing every time - tonkotsu. I add plenty of sesame seeds, chili oil and chili powder to jazz it up. I really wish they had sesame oil as well. The slice of pork belly in the bowl is ON POINT! The portion size is huge, as per usual with ramen, so wear your stretchy pants. One thing that keeps me from going when i really want a delicious bowl of ramen is the rough seating arrangement and HORRIBLE plastic high top ikea bar stools. They are tiny and slippery and it'snot a comfortable way to devour your piping hot ramen. I hope they expand to a bigger location and get some better furniture. My boyfriend often gets the miso with spicy noodles. this might be crazy, but I like to add his miso to my tonkotsu or steal some of his spicy noodles. I think those small difference make a big difference in overall taste. Service is great, though wait staff is usually sparse...so you may have to wait or they may forget your beer. You can't fit any more employees in this place! This place is far better than Republic (sorry!), so give it a try. I'll say it again - stretchy pants."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude and unhelpful. And please do not call your noodles \"ramen\" because it is an insult to all the good ramen places out there."}
