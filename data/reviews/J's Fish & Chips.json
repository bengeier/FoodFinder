{"text":"Best fish and chips place in Newmarket.   The portions are big and the batter is very light and crispy. The owner is very friendly and cares about his customers"}
{"text":"This was a hidden find after our trip in newmarket! The owners really went BEYOND laying out our utensils and meticulously preparing our food. I have never seen such Michelin star perfectionism! The daily specials were jaw dropping good deal! Don't let that scare turn you away!

The fish was coated lightly and fried well and the fries were done right. Anyone living or happening nearby should give this unpretentious neighborhood place a chance. I know I might have turned my nose up and walked away by hiding at the exterior but I do not regret giving this shop a try! I'll be back with my dad at some point!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner/cook as well as his wife.
Excellent fish & fries quality 
Unbelievable price for Halibut dinner 
We will keep coming back to this place many times.
Good to have this guy in Newmarket, we are lucky!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw this restaurant. The food is great, not too much batter on the fish and they give you a tray with ketchup, vinegar, mayo, coleslaw, and salt. The tray is neatly organized showing their attention to detail. The owner comes and asks if I needed anything. Very good service. Price is very good as well, I got their $8 lunch special. Very decent portions."}
{"text":"Back from the States to visit family and needing to get my Fish and Chips fix in soI came straight to J's. I haven't found anything in the States that comes close to the great Fish and Chip I expect in Canada. And rest assured J's doesn't disappoint. My portions were great, fries done right and the Halibut fantastic and all at a great price.  They have Haddock and Cod as well but I'm mainly a Halibut man. The fries are like the chip wagon fries I remember getting as a kids. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for great Fish and Chips."}
{"text":"Place was packed and there was a line up for take out orders by 6pm on a Friday. Great price for what you get. I'd recommend the halibut! The batter was light and crispy. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"First off, I need to say that I wanted to take a star off for service after walking in on a Friday night and having to wait 40 minutes for my order. After eating my long anticipated meal though, I thought better of it, realized that they were insanely busy, and that good food is worth waiting for. And it was indeed worth the wait!
Next time I'll definitely take J's advice and phone my order in, then come and pick it up later. 
Even with the place as busy as it was; and even though I had gotten a little cranky after my wait, the staff remained friendly, accommodating, and kept working up a storm. I'm not sure who was cooking the fish and chips in the back, but they must have been going full tilt, and J and his helper were quickly and efficiently taking orders in person and by phone, packing stuff to go, serving in house customers, and even cooking burgers at the counter for those who ordered them. And in all of it, J still made sure to give every person a nice comment, a thank you for coming, etc. 
Now for the food:  To put it simply; it was AMAZING. Juicy, tender fish, light batter, freshly made thick cut fries, and all piping hot still by the time I got home with it. All for an amazing price. I'm not much of a fish snob, so I just went with the haddock, and for $6 for a nice piece of fish and more fries than I expected, who could complain? They also offered many other specials, including a $9 halibut and chips, a $6 burger combo, etc. 
This was some of the best fish and chips I've had. None of that greasy \"it feels like someone painted the roof of my mouth with lard\" feeling during or after eating.  I will DEFINITELY be going back"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great portions. 
The food is fresh and clean. It's not overly oily.
If you like fish and chips or even if you don't, this is the place to go. Their burgers are also good and poutine."}
{"text":"Somehow I have missed this place before but that will not happen again!  This is the best fish and chips we've had for a long time. 
We had both the Cod and the Halibut, which came in a light breading and not greasy at all.  The fries are thick cut and cooked well. A simple menu with fair prices.
The owner, Jay, runs the counter and provided awesome customer service to me and my family. The food was brought to the table, he was sure to take the extra time to speak directly with the kids, and Jay was sure to check to make sure all of us enjoyed the food. Jay won over the kids when he made a special trip to the table to give them each a lollipop.
We will be telling our friends to come here and we will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Nice clean location, super friendly owner and staff.
Got haddock and chips, price was really good.  Actually surprised me, especially compared to AB prices for the same meal.
Fish was perfectly cooked.  Batter was very tasty.  Chips were more fries than traditional British chips but still tasty.  I'd also describe the batter as such.  Not a traditional British taste, but even so, you will not be disappointed.  We all really enjoyed this meal.  The portion size was also perfect for lunch.
I'm not in this area often but I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again.
I would recommend."}
{"text":"First........the GOOD.   very clean establishment, excellent service, the batter was a near perfect golden brown colour.  The Not-so-Good............The owner needs to realize that fish shops must serve white vinegar, as well as malt vinegar.  He also needs to buy some glass pepper shakers because many Canadians like pepper on their fries and their fish.  Delivering up those tiny tear-packs just doesn't cut it.  To some people, that might be a small thing but not to me. I like my pepper and in quantity. 

While the portions appear to be large, I found that the Halibut was sliced far too thin and this leads to the fish being dry instead of nice and moist.  Please do not try and fool us this way.  We are not stupid.  Pricing was reasonable and on a par with many other places that specialize in fish and chips.  The chips were obviously hand cut on site and while they were not fantastic, they were cooked properly and I ate them all. 

If I was in the neighbourhood and in the mood for fish and chips, I would return to J's........but I would not drive there specially."}
{"text":"this place has a nice and homey feel too it, plus the way their food is severed reminds me of all the stories my grandma used to tell me about living in Britain. She loved, more then anything, their fish and chips."}
