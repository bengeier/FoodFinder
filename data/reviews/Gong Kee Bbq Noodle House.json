{"text":"I never come to this area of the city, however I asked the lady who cut my hair where she thought might be a good place for Vietnamese food.
I will review that place after I'm finished with this one.
Okay it's a small place located in a strip mall, just down the street from the Forest Lawn High  school. They have a few lunch specials listed on the outside in the window. You can order (sweet and sour pork with fried rice), (chicken wings with fried rice), (wonton soup and spring rolls), and (ginger beef with fried rice). All of these were for $7.99 a plate. add a canned pop for $1.00.
I came in a b tiny bit apprehensive as my two boys and I were the only ones who were in the small restaurant. (The time was 11:50 a.m.). As we ordered, the restaurant did get busier. I would say about half full, and they were doing a fairly steady takeout (pick-up) business as well.
As for the food, the fried rice was good (a huge portion), and the chicken wings were over battered. (tasty otherwise). The sweet and sour pork combo was good, it came with the same big portion of fried rice and the sweet and sour pork was the usual with green peppers, onions, and pineapple. The spring roll wasn't anything to write home about. (It was average).
I never had a chance to look at the menu, as I asked for the lunch specials that were on the front window. The tables that were in front and behind me, ordered combination meals. (combo A's) to be exact. When those plates came out, they were a heaping plate full of fried rice, ginger beef ?, and mixed vegetables.
( I think if I go back, I'll try a combo).
The restaurant itself is small ( about 10-12 tables ) most are tables for 4. I think if memory serves me correctly they had a bigger round table that could seat 5.

This restaurant also sells bbq pork by the lb. as well as bbq duck. Its like the ones you would see in Chinatown hanging from the windows.

In conclusion, would I go back to this place ? Maybe if I'm in the area. The food is average, but the prices are pretty good. You can a plate full of chinese food, for the price of a Macdonald's Big Mac meal."}
{"text":"I have been to once before.  The impression that it left me the last time was that this place was expensive.  This time I just happened to be in the neighbourhood and needed to grab a quick lunch, so I came back.  Again the prices are on the high side.  The BBQ pork (char siu) quality is average but the portions are larger than average (but still doesn't justifies the price).  The rice was cooked with too much water.  I am afraid better food could be had for less money just a short drive to the north.  T&T supermarket offers decent Chinese BBQ meats for cheap and Pebble Street in the same mall offer the same thing for cheaper prices than Gong Kee (which says alot, since Pebble Street have prices on the higher end too)."}
{"text":"We've gone to Gong Kee for a very long time, even for wedding catering back in the day. Their food can be absolutely delicious on the right day, but that's to be expected with any restaurant. The current chefs are doing a great job, but let me tell you the free dumplings you can get with your order are INCREDIBLE. I'm very possessive over them whenever we order, they're absolutely perfect if you mix the dumpling sauce with some balsamic vinegar. Their food is usually quite flavourful (drink a lot of water! and stay away if you're MSG sensitive - I'm personally not but we're pretty sure there's quite a bit of it; that's not a rarity in some Asian cuisines so I'm pretty fine with it.)"}
{"text":"The house chow main is awesome!  Changed owners a few years ago but still a hole in the wall classic for cheap!"}
{"text":"When you visit Gongkee, you will definitely see how small the dinning room is. The restaurant itself looks like it's more setup for take out rather than dine-in. You can order cut meats and take out up at the front.

 We have had sit down lunches here before, and the service is great. The orders come in quickly and consistently. It's family owned, so the owners really care about their customers and put a lot of effort with every order.

The food is great as well, although a little oily on their fried food(chicken, squid, etc.). Their Peking duck is awesome and we really enjoy their shanghai/special noodles. My parents regularly order take out from them as well.

I would give Gong Kee 4 stars if their dinning area was bigger and updated. But overall the food is great and the prices are very reasonable. So definitely recommend Gong Kee for take outs, lunches and quick bites for small parties.
