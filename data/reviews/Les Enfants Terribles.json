{"text":"Les Enfants Terribles is an ambiance restaurant. It's a great place to unwind and have a few drinks while enjoying some music. If you expect your taste buds to have an epiphany don't go there. It doesn't mean it's not good but rather simplistic in nature. My burger was the least garnished burger Ive ever eaten in my life, a slice of tomato,  a tiny slice of onion, half a lettuce leaf and 2 tiny pickles: beyond ordinary. 3/5 stars for food 4/5 stars for the ambiance 3/5 for service. I went there because invited to a launch party, will not be back there unless a very good friend is insisting."}
{"text":"Elevated simple food.  I had the Special, Italian Scrambled Eggs, which was a brilliant combination of fresh herbs, tomatoes and red onions, perfectly seasoned.  My husband had a smoked salmon seafood eggs benedict with fresh fruit and roasted potatoes which he is still raving about....The service was warm, attentive and professional.  All staff seemed happy to be there and responded well to one another.  We will return and bring our guests."}
{"text":"This used to be a standby. However on a recent visit, at a time when they weren't that busy, the service at the bar was sub par. I waited almost a half hour for my main course -- a pretty uncomplicated grilled sandwich. The broccoli soup I had to start had streaks of what I assume was corn starch and didn't really taste of broccoli. Resting on their laurels?"}
{"text":"Le service et la qualité des repas sont inconsistants. Après quelques déceptions, j'ai décidé de ne plus retourner."}
{"text":"What a disgusting restaurant!! 4 people in our group ordered the Shepherd's Pie. 3 of the 4 were cold. The dish looks like canned dog food swimming in a pool of flavorless yellow crap. Besides the look, it tasted like what I expect dog food to taste like. One person in our group managed to send hers back and order something different, but unfortunately, once I realized that mine was cold and disgusting, no wait staff was to be found anywhere. Awful service with limited communication skills (it is Laval, after all, can't expect too much from them, I guess). If you're a white-framed sunglasses wearing, Ed Hardy t-shirt wearing, Moomba attending, 450 douchebag, by all means, try it, you may like it. But for those of us with at least basic knowledge of what food should be, stay away!!"}
{"text":"Bof trop lent à attendre ! Et le burger n'était pas si goûtant ! Ce n'est pas les enfants qui sont terrible ...."}
{"text":"Always enyoyed my time there! Great meals and drinks! La salade Cesar est un incontournable (avec la bonne vinaigrette à base de yogurt)
The mac and cheese, fish and chips, octopus and salmon tartars are tasty too:)
Toujours bondé de monde alors soyez patients ou reservez par telephone !"}
{"text":"view be damned, $30 for a rubbery flank steak just doesn't fly. 
knew we were in for a ride when they brought around a basket of Costco ciabatta buns. 
fine place to grab a pint and watch the sun set, but no need to eat with escondite or balsam mere minutes away."}
{"text":"Simple et delicieux. J'y suis aller l'an passé et cette année. Plats simple et classique mais efficace et super satisfesant coter qualité/prix. J'ai manger des calmars; mayonaise épicer parfaite, légère panure, te texture magnifique. Comme plat principaux a ce moment il y avais spécialement pour la haute saison un macaronie au fromage au homard.. WOW! Crèmeux, riche, gratiné au four avec de gros morceux de homard. Le meilleur mac n cheese que j'ai manger à Montréal. Simple mais délicieux.

Le service était super. Mon copain a eu un erreur dans sa commande, il lui on rajouter du fromage dans son burger par erreur. Il se sont bien assurer qu'il n'était pas intolérant au lactose puis lui on offert de refaire le burger ou lui apporter sans les frais supplémentaire pour le fromage.

La terrasse est très bien, et l'ambiance du resto aussi. Jamais deux sans trois.. J'y retournerai c'est sure!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 in our early 20s and had a reservation for 8:30 on a Thursday night. We were speaking English to one another but all of us are fluent in French. Upon entering the very crowded and cramped restaurant at 8:25, we were told that our table wasn't ready yet. There were no seats for the 6 of us and we had no choice but to stand in the narrow passageway between tables, making it difficult for the servers to pass and unintentionally uncomfortably hovering over customers who were already seated.

By 8:45, our table still wasn't ready, and upon inquiring, the hostess said that the party was taking a long time to eat and she couldn't do anything about it. She added that there was a note in our reservation that we'd be willing to wait, which she was sure to point out by the word \"dattendre\" under our name on the screen. We were told there could be a five minute wait upon making the reservation, not a half hour wait! Finally, we left the restaurant at 9:00, but it is certainly not easy to find space for 6 people on Bernard without a reservation.

About 5 minutes after leaving, we received a call saying our table was now ready and returned to Les Enfants Terribles. As the busboy was setting the table with wine glasses, the waiter said in French \"no wine glasses for them, they won't be needing them\" as if we didn't understand. Three of us did in fact order cocktails (at $12 a glass, may I add,) but two of the drinks had no alcohol whatsoever in them. When we told the waiter there was no alcohol in them, he didn't even deny it, and instead said \"I'll get you a new one.\"

As the waiter was taking our orders, I told him that we had waited over half an hour for our table and said I hope something could be done. When he returned, he said that he was told that we were told that there would be a wait and consequently there was nothing that could be done. There was no apology whatsoever and the blame seemed to be put on us. This is absolutely absurd, given that we were told that there could be a 5 minute wait, not over a 30-minute one. That long a wait is simply unacceptable for any establishment, much less a restaurant with Les Enfants Terribles' jacked-up prices.

The food itself was good, and once we were seated, the service was prompt. Nevertheless, one could find the same quality of food for a cheaper price elsewhere in the city, and certainly with better service.

Overall, it was a \"terrible\" experience (pun intended). I sincerely hope that the management of Les Enfants Terribles reads this review and realizes that a paying customer is a paying customer, whether they are young or old or speak English or French, and deserve to be treated with the same amount of respect. All customers also have the ability to tarnish the restaurant's name by writing a negative review online. Guess I just did that!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience despite the medium reviews, we decided to go. The view was spectacular and the service is amazing. The food came quickly and was delicious.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It is on the pricey side but I don't complain if the service and food is great, and it was!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a night with friends.  Food was great but the service was slow and long.  Waitress was kind but incognito most of the night."}
{"text":"Tasty food. On the other hand, the cocktails were terrible. Mojitos tasted like water. When we asked if we could get some more rum in it, we were told no. Definitely not a nice way to treat customers."}
{"text":"I loooove this restaurant!! We are regulars! I suggest the table dhote, as the chef changes it daily and items from it are full of flavor and creativity! Bonus- kids menu- my 5yr old loves the chicken strips and the booster chair is a very nice feature!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The waitress Julie was very good. Nothing extraordinary on the food side, they didnt have regular brunch for Canada day, only 3 items of the menu. Nice ambiance with a nice view to the river."}
{"text":"Je suis partagée sur ce resto. Premièrement,  j'y suis allée l'été, sur la terrasse et j'ai trouvé que les tables sont très petites et près l'unes des autres, mais le tout est tout de même bien aménagé. Pour les bouteilles de vin, plutôt que de les mettre dans un sceau (qui prend beaucoup d'espace), ils les mettent dans des sacs en plastiques solide qu'ils fixent au crochet installé sous la table. Le tout est plutôt ingénieux. 

Le service était aussi très bien pour une soirée aussi achalandée. J'ai pris le pâté chinois au buf effiloché et il était excellent.. une fois salée. Par contre, mon copain a pris une assiette de pâtes qui était peu goûteuse. J'y retournerai probablement puisque j'en gade somme toute une bonne impression!"}
{"text":"The food that we had was good - the bavette was cooked very very nicely but the fries that were served with it were obviously cooked in a \"past its prime\" oil. 
The most disappointing part of the evening was the wait staff. It started with the fact that when we arrived with a reservation for 3, we had to stand beside while they pulled the tables together ... there was only 10 other clients in the entire resto. Told the waiter that we would share a large salad - he forgot to bring an extra plate. With the main course asked for mayo for the fries - only to be told that it was on my plate ... which it was not. oppps. 

Considering the price for the dinner they need to make a quantum leap forward in the level of service they provide - the staff needs major training. I will wait a year or so before I go back."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of comfort food, however they have tartares and salads too:) I mainly go for the bistro ambiance, sit at the bar, and relax. The Outremont location is close to my house and work, so very convenient for me to meet friends or for business meetings."}
{"text":"Although the location is highly convenient if one is attending the opera at Théâtre Outrement, the bustling, crowded tables render intimate conversation impossible. However, the yellow tomato purée was an innovative form of gazpacho. The atmosphere is trendy in a true bistro locale."}
{"text":"À ce qui se dit certains adorent, personnellement j'ai détesté.
Très bruyant à l'intérieur, pas beaucoup mieux en terrasse. Le personnel n'est pas agréable et le service est long. Un peu trop de chi-chi pour servir un morceau de pain: Perds pas ton temps avec une pince et laisse le panier sur la table on t'attend en cuisine!
Qui plus est pour une place qui se dit française, et bien en France on ne mange pas ces plats là ouf! 
Sur 6 personnes, on a goûté à bien des plats et malheureusement aucun n'a retenu notre attention.
Trop cuit ou pas assez, question assaisonnement c'est juste l'addition qui était salée, et Comment font ils pour manquer un burger?! Une chose est sûre c'est que je manquerai d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"The irony is in the name.Food was terrible quality and very overpriced. Service was clumsy and inconsiderate.   The only nice thing about this place was the modern wood decor, high crested ceilings and big windows.

I ordered the lamb burger and a Saporro beer on draft and my bill came to $30 for lunch time, pretty steep especially considering the low quality of the food. When paying by debit card you cant put your own tip amount, you are forced to chose between 15%-17%-20% which is ridiculous. 

My friend was asked what kind of cheese they would like with their burger and the waiter didnt mention that it was an additional $2.50 to add it. The burgers themselves were very dry, unsalted and completed devoid of flavor. The cheese in mine almost had an unpleasant sour taste. 

Dont get me wrong, its a nice ambiance. I have no problem with paying $30 for a hamburger at lunch if it was the best burger you'd ever it, but this was very far from it.  It seems like the people that flock here might be wealthy with bad taste in food. 

Overall try at your own risk, but dont say i didnt warn you about the food. Try Cafe Souvenir next door, their burgers are 100 times better at 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Was in town for poutine week.
We came around 9pm on a Saturday and it was really busy but were seated promptly 
Great food/drinks, great service and really nice relaxed ambience - in a beautiful city."}
{"text":"This corner was a goldmine waiting to happen. While the previous dump (Vasco da Gama?) circled the drain with its overpriced crappy sandwiches and holier-than-thou attitude, whoever owns this place now was plotting to open one bistro in Outremont to end them all.

And what an opening- gorgeous decor accented by driftwood-like beams studding the walls, iron, shades of grey mixed with black and white, all very HGTVish, but done with extreme taste. On summer nights the terrace wraps around the corner and the ambience is absolutely top-notch. The patrons are a total motley crew - everything from pipe-smoking faux-Parisian Outremont snobs, to 50-something MILFs having one too many with their real estate coworkers, to Moroccan guys in their mid-30's with white belts and matching 'crocodile' Aldo shoes. A total melange, and yet it works somehow.  

And what about the food, you ask? No one cares. Who needs a killer menu with so many other assets? And yet, the food is not bad. I mean, it's not going to win any awards - but go tell that to the million people lining up every weeknight to snatch a seat outside. That being said, the tartare and good old bistro-burger are excellent, and the breakfast is pretty good, too.

This place is a real treat. If you're from out of town and want to really experience a Montreal summer evening in full bloom, head to this little gem."}
{"text":"Bon éclairage, bonne ambiance, mais assez bruyant! Le service laisse à désirer la nourriture est très moyenne et le prix est très élevé pour ce que c'est."}
{"text":"Situated in a trendy neighbourhood and a stone's throw away from the much celebrated ice cream shop Bilboquet, this is a perfect spot for summertime lunch on the terrace.  Even when braving the cold winter months, this restaurant offers a good selection of comfort food and the interior decor is quite chic and inviting.

I'd recommend the gazpacho and one of the tartare plates.  The portion sizes are good for such rich cuisine.  If you're feeling spunkier, why not try the delicious mini chorizo pogos?  They're bite-sized wonders that shouldn't be passed up!  The beet salad is quite filling and offers an unexpected bite...think beets, pecans, greens, grapes and delicious goat cheese, with great presentation.  Though it may not be as innovative as the other dishes, another stand-by is the macaroni and cheese, which is decently good, but not the best I've ever had (try the pulled porc mac n cheese with truffle chips from Mbrgr for a foodgasmic experience).

The reason this restaurant gets a 3/5 rather than a 4 is because the food is pretty good, but isn't, in the words of Russell Peters, \"mind blasting.\"  It's a cute spot to go hang out in the summer time if you're in the area, but nothing to write home about, except for maybe the pogos, which I wish would come in regular size :)"}
{"text":"Even if I discount my positive experience at the \"flagship\" LET in Outremont, this place is overwhelmingly underwhelming.  Though the decor is great, the Nun's Island LET just doesn't deliver on taste or service.

It took over an hour for our group to get drinks, and it's not like the place was crowded.  The cocktails were inventive but were watered down. The appetizers were mediocre and the mains were not very impressive at all.  I ordered the crab ravioli, which were imbalanced and had so much mayonnaise that I felt a little nausea.  The cesar salad was nice, but I wouldn't order it over the pogos, which are the only thing worth ordering here besides the tartare.  The steak is horribly mediocre and the fries were like limp greasy noodles.

Service was slow and not very polite.  They waiter seemed annoyed with our group when we asked if he could move the position of one of the lights, which was beaming directly into the face of one of our guests (it was a misplaced light). Orders were mismanaged and placed in the wrong setting without any apologies.  Lame.  Also, we were seated outside directly under a boiling heat lamp.  We felt like we were getting sunburns!

The only other thing worth ordering is the pouding chomeur.  It was delicious and saved an otherwise disappointing dining experience. 

That's it and that's all I have to say about this place.  I would give it a 1.5/5 but the ambiance is pretty nice and there are a FEW hidden gems like the pogos, tartare, and poudding chomeur.  I'll avoid coming back here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best casual restaurants in MTL! In the summertime you can sit outside which great because mtl is super cold in the winter. The beet salad is really good, The Mac and Cheese is really good. If I liked Cesar Salad I would tell you its incredible. They have this really good Mojito with maple syrup. 
The best of the best is the chicken liver mousse with toasted bread. The Puding Chomeur is really like a sticky toffee with a cooked cake inside and ice cream. OMG it changed my life. It is super hot so give it a min or two."}
{"text":"Horrible food , horrible service .
Don't even think of going there.
OVERRATED."}
{"text":"1 étoile pour la vue! Nous y sommes allés pour le nouvel an 2017/2018 et la cuisine n'a rien d'extraordinaire. 
À l'apéritif nous avons pris une douzaine d'huîtres et 1 bouteille de chablis
1 huître par personne pour les mises en bouche
Du cabillaud en plat
Et une bûche minuscule en dessert ( sans saveur)

Résultat des courses : 583$ cad pour 4 personnes plus 15% de pourboire obligatoire ce qui fait 660$ au total... 

De plus la musique était assourdissante, on ne s'entendait pas parler... Et un peu avant minuit les serveurs ont tenté de nous distribuer des kazous et des chapeaux en carton avec écrit \"Bonne année \". Autant aller au Buffalo Grill...

Alors pour aller boire un verre, oui mais pour manger, certainement pas!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, the service was nice and fast even though they were packed."}
{"text":"BRUNCH: Went there for brunch once and it was eeally OK. We couldn't even get a clean glass of water. Imagine! And the food was good but nothing \"woah\" about it. In my opinion, this place is a bit overrated and overpriced for the menu they have to offer.

I will give it a try for dinner. Let's hope this time it will be less disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was terrible  
I met up with my friends. They waited about an hour to be seated (with a reservation made way in advance. About a week or so ago) and the hostess was so annoyed that I was an hour late. She also told me she has no idea where they were due to how the system is set up and that I had to go roam around the restaurant and look for them myself. Which was extremely difficult to do given how busy it was. I met with them about an hour after they were finally seated. They were waiting for their meal. Which took about an hour and a half to get. And the entire time I wasn't given a menu not asked if I wanted anything. I decided to opt out even even ordering so I didn't end up asking for anything but I was so thirsty I asked for water finally. I get its a big place and very busy. Although I didn't get to try the food so I can't really say anything about it and my friends seemed to really enjoy what they were eating. The service was so bad it could really hurt the business. I think they have an amazing thing going and if they can work on their customer service they can really have a great rep. But I do get good workers is so hard to find these days."}
{"text":"Best place on the island.  Great chill place outside in the summer by the water.  Good food"}
{"text":"Tres bonne experience! Le steak et le poisson sont tres delicieux. On aime pour la cuisine et pour l'ambiance."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant in Centropolis   Laval , The drinks are fantastic tried the leche martini  , the food is good , been there many times and tried the salmon dish and the fish and ships and the entrees of betteraves  and goat cheese very tasty very good service , I love it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times, it is high time for me to write a review.

The decor has already been described by previous reviews, so I won't expand too much on that. Let's just say, a very cool mix of nice wood tables on a more modern backdrop. Very nicely done. I agree that this may not be the best place for an intimate dinner, but that is not the type of place it is. You have more than enough space at your table, but it is a lively and vibrant restaurant so you need to be up for that. 

The food is very good, vegetables are fresh. It isn't an artisanal menu, but what they do, they do well.

But really, the thing I love about this place is the service. I was there this morning and, despite being very busy, the wait-staff was patient and smiling. Our waitress came by multiple times with the coffee, and was incredibly patient with my indecisiveness (sorry again about that). This only follows on similar previous experiences - I have come with my friend and her two young children before. The waiter brought over colors and coloring paper and was great with the kids despite their... activity. On yet another visit, we sat outside on a slightly chilly night and the waitress brought some of the girls shawls to warm up.

Really, the fact that these guys manage to maintain the level of service they do at such a trendy and bustling restaurant is impressive. Many thanks, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a weekend brunch. I got the Benedictines terre (bacon, roasted tomato, goat cheese and spinach) and they were marvelous. Their hollandaise sauce was pretty good too. My friends got the tar time de boudin and chocolate banana gaufres and both were raving about the food as well.

Service was good as well. The only complaint really is my friend came in a little late for brunch and asked the hostess after being seated for a coffee, and she told him that she's just the hostess and to ask the waiters when they come. Kinda disappointing attitude. But the service was great beside this incident."}
{"text":"Les Enfants Terribles at its core is a great restaurant. The menu is nicely varied, the food is delicious...when it arrives at a reasonable time and in the correct order. I've had great and mediocre experiences here, mostly around the services unfortunately. Its either the food arrives way too late, the order is wrong or the waiter/waitress is so-so on the professional side. That being said when it works, it works very well. Worth a shot, especially in summer with that fantastic view and great terrace."}
{"text":"Amazing french toast! They serve it drizzled with syrup, just the right amount, perfectly cooked homemade brioche.  I'd like to branch out and try other things, as my friends' eggs benedict looked great too, but I'm sure I'd just order the french toast again as soon as I walked through the door!  They have separate English menus for the non-francophones, which is unusual in Montreal (but much appreciated!).  Scrambled eggs were soft-cooked and very creamy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for dinner and today for brunch! I've definitely enjoyed my experience both times. For dinner I had their salmon tartar and was impressed by the freshness. Super yummy! Brunch with my mom: We both chose egg benedicts. I ordered the smoked salmon one, and she ordered the classic. She originally wanted the bacon one, but they did not let her omit the goat cheese. I also ordered a grapefruit mimosa and my mom ordered a cappuccino. Our order came with a bowl of fruit and house potatoes. I really enjoyed my meal, and so did my mom! The order also gave us some homemade jams to try. The place was super cozy and modern, with the wooden interior and \"bar area\". Overall, I really enjoyed it and would come back again!"}
{"text":"The service brings down the food. I had been sitting down for over 15 minutes and had not received a menu, although many waiters were around. None paid attention to me though, and were borderline rude. I had to waive down 3 waiters before I received a menu. The waiter who did serve us was nice and pleasant, but kept forgetting our drink orders and did not fill up our water glasses. Not many vegetarian options to choose from so I had the Cesar salad, which wasn't bad, but had way too much dressing. Plating was also extremely over the top and outdated. Some of my friends liked their food, and the patio is nice, so I give this place two stars, but they really need to do something about the service."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday.  I love the atmosphere of this place, especially in the summer and the outdoor seating -- but not too prententious.  

The menu is french/quebequoi, and the specials all seemed interesting.  We really enjoyed our appetizers -- beet salad and warm goat cheese salad.  However, it took an hour between our appetizers and main course.  We all ordered the specials, but there was apparently something wrong in the kitchen.  When they arrived, they were all not great -- the striped bass was dry, the beef was tough, etc.  

Dessert was okay -- molten chocolate cake was okay, creme brulee was great.  Our waitress apologized for the delay, which was nice.

I think I'd go back, but I am not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"Bel emplacement pour ce charmant bistro. Parfait pour un bon brunch bien qu' il ne semble jamais avoir assez de tables. Menu alléchant et portions généreuses. Un délicieux brunch dans une atmosphère chaleureuse et attentionnée."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite spot to brunch on nuns island--let me know through a PM if you can change my mind about it with other suggestions.

Okay, so what is Les Enfants Terribles ? To me it's a mix of French Canadian cuisine with an aroma of French and American flavours. Their brunches are excellent and affordable --think about 12-18$ price range. Portions are not too small or big , but it should feed one's tummy quite easily. Nonetheless , you don't go there for the portion , but for the quality. I believe that the food is yummy and if you are not satisfied with one thing --please let the head of the waiting staff know about it he will fix it or change it in no time according to my previous experience . Yes , their customer service is AMAZING. Service is fast and efficient , I also think the same for their takeout service --takes approximately 15-20 mins to get 4 orders for lunch so for whoever is in a rush , you won't be disappointed.

Anyway, regarding the food , I can only speak for brunch or lunch as I havnt not tried the dinner , please do take into consideration les enfants terribles as a choice , I don't think one can be disappointed. Also , don't forget to take the ORANGE JUICE --so sweet and tasty and I think you just won't get enough about it and you will crave it as soon as you walk away ."}
{"text":"Le uova più buone che io abbia mai mangiato!! Dovrei aggiungere altro?...

Unico difettuccio é che la cucina é a vista sulla sala quindi ci si impazza un po' vestiti e capelli ! Prezzi nella media della città..."}

{"text":"Je  suis aller aux Enfants Terribles du Centre-ville avec ma fille puisque nous connaissons celui d'Outremont qui est bien...Extrêmement décevant en commençant par un accueil sans bonjour, sans sourire en nous demandant \"Avez-vous une réservation?\" ma réponse\"Non\" elle me renvoie \"Ok j'ai juste de la place au bar!\". Le seul point positif est la vue sur la ville...Notre serveur avait aucune attention, intérêt ou courtoisie à notre égard, jamais il est venu nous voir pour nous informer de la lenteur d'être servi par contre une boss boy c'est informée quand elle voyait que nous n'étions pas encore servis, notre serveur était trop occupé à fleurter les deux blondes à coté de nous...Une heure plus tard nos assiettes arrivent, deux ufs Benedicts au au saumon fumé avec un morceau gros comme mon pouce et des muffins anglais durs comme de la brique quasi impossible de couper avec le couteau et des pommes de terres rissolées grasses et trop cuites, même pas un morceau de fruits pour accompagner ce plat de 14$...À revoir, le service, la nourriture bas de gamme, la courtoisie des employés et hôtesses ...Plus jamais pour nous!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place in Outremont but just came back from the one in laval and was disappointed, drinks don't taste the same and my fave dishes weren't as tasty..."}
{"text":"I tried the (new?) LAVAL location in Centropolis this week and was not disappointed. 

My parents often surprise me and suggested the LAVAL location of Les Enfants Terribles for an early week-night family dinner to celebrate my brother's graduation. My brother and I were both unaware that such a location existed and whole-heartedly agreed.

This location is much larger than the one on Bernard and open and airy with eclectic, modern wood decor. It was fairly full at 7pm on a Tuesday night with an after-work crowd and some families, but the 4 of us were seated immediately with a smile. 

Service was quick and friendly. Our water carafe was constantly replaced and our glasses topped off with a smile. 

Food was delicious and no one had any complaints about their order - in spite of the fact that they were out of the ribs my dad had been eyeing! He settled on the salmon and proclaimed it fresh and well cooked - my brother seconded the opinion - and judging from their clean plates it was a hit! My mom had the burger and was pleased that it was well-cooked yet still flavourful. I had one of my favourites, the paté chinois and was not disappointed. The potatoes were creamy and savoury with just the right touch of truffle oil and the braised beef was melt-in-your-mouth.

My brother and I shared the snickers cake for dessert - it was basically a brownie with peanuts and vanilla ice cream - but it was rich and very good! 

Add to it that the prices are very reasonable and we were a happy bunch!"}
{"text":"This place should be called \"Le Service Terrible\".   Very disappointed.  Extremely slow,  disorganized and got our order wrong to top it off."}
{"text":"We tried getting a table at 5 o'clock. The restaurant was half empty and yet the lady still would not give us a table for four people. It's a beautiful restaurant but the staff is rude and you're better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"To be avoided at all costs.  We tried this restaurant for lunch using a gift certificate I received for Christmas and will never return.  The restaurant is very poorly designed and organized, creating bottlenecks and forcing the wait staff to navigate narrow and often congested pathways.  We ordered flank steaks and one had to be returned for shoddy meat quality and being cold, not to mention a very poor interpretation of \"medium rare\" cooking.  The wait staff does all they can to make the best out of a bad situation and they should be commended for it.  

However, this pales in comparison to the horrible ambiance in the restaurant.  The entire dining area is loud and obnoxious.  The tables are crammed together, making conversation virtually impossible over the incessant banter of poorly mannered middle managers, too busy revelling in their own perceived importance to realize how their never ending cackling is ruining the experience of those around them. The view is nice but ultimately lost in a tidal wave of claustrophobic mediocrity.  

All in all, the only purpose served by this sad excuse of an establishment is to demonstrate why most people would do the world a favor by eating at their desks.  

Makes me miss the days of club 737..."}
{"text":"Had a dinner at LET between Christmas an New Years, an evening of a day after. I was in the mood for comfort food: a beer, a green salad, and a plate of spaghetti. Everything hit the mark on that evening. If you don't enjoy the taste of sun-dried tomatoes, don't order the spaghetti. Also it comes with a cylinder of unripened cheese on top that didn't add to the dish. The atmosphere is warm, even if you have to sit on wooden school chairs. The service has improved over the last six months. Arriving early and getting ahead of the 7 o'clock rush is a good idea. It's a bit pricey for a plate of pasta, but other menu items have a better price to value ratio."}
{"text":"The servive waa slow,  the quality of food wasn't good,  the variety of the menu was limited.  There is no dessert menu and the brownie was cold and hard. Not recommend"}
{"text":"Great place, great food and great ambiance. One of the best patios in town for summer. This place is right across from Outremont theater where all the top French troupes from Paris come to perform. Naturally they come to chill at this restaurant after the show. So if you want to socialize with some really bohemian French artists this is your spot."}

I've been there twice for brunch. It is pretty standard French brunch food with omelets,  crepes, croissants etc... 

The potatoes they served as a side were magnificent and seasoned to perfection. Great terrace outside in the summer.

Admittedly it is pricey but it's worth the extra money. It can be a bit slow compared to cheaper brunch places like Cora but it is something to be expected in more high end places where they hopefully don't reheat dishes.

I might go again in the future for lunch or supper, it's a nice and cozy place."}
{"text":"Lovely decor: high vaulted ceilings, reclaimed wood, old wooden schoolroom chairs, lots of light. 

Mediocre brunch. No more than a standard menu - my omelette was perfectly respectable, but the choices are slim, especially compared to Café Souvenir next door. Allongé was bitter and burnt-tasting; jam was an inedible Kraft packet you'd expect from a corner greasy spoon.

Not terrible, but not worth going back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place this is. I was in town on business and was brought here for diner. Just happened to be during a record breaking week of amazing Spring weather. The place was packed! The patio bustling with happy patrons. We waited 10 minutes to be seated and started our meal with an Outremont Mojito, a twist on the classic using dark run rather than white and maple syrup instead of cane syrup. De-licious!

The menu is simple comfort food made well.... Sheapards pie, Mac and cheese, burgers, even mini pogo's for appies. They also have a clue tartares that looked amazing and some rockin salads. I landed on the lamb burger which was absolutely delectable. The fries were hand cut and cooked to perfection and came with home made mayo and ketchup for dipping. 

Although fully satisfied, I couldn't resist trying the \"pudding chomeur\" a childhood favorite. HEAVEN!

Go check it out. Well worth the wait if you don't have a reservation."}
{"text":"We ate here again on my trip to Montreal last week. I ordered the Salmon with kale on quinoa, my daughter had the Mac & Cheese. Honestly it was the best salmon I have had in my life.

Again, we had a reservation. Still as busy as it was a year ago. Try to book ahead. But it is That Good, and well worth the trip from wherever you are in Montreal.

They have lovely heated sidewalk seating as well, which is a little less crazy than inside. I love, love, love this restaurant."}
{"text":"So, we went to ride up to a near by resto to pick up a friend after work, (3 doors down), and decided to stay in the area for some food and a few drinks for it was a beautiful Sunday in the summer of montreal.  And that does not last long so one has to take advantage of such situations.  Just one humble man's opinion, and for the record, i randomly met this man, and found out that he was not that humble.  Anyways, it has a proper setup, and an aesthetically pleasing feel.  And having been involved in rest's that is such an important tool for your business.  Inside was on point along with the the terraces, and yes, they have two, one smoking, well, i should not have to name the other..  Best dish that was brought to the table was a lamb burger with goat cheese and of course normal burger garnishing and was \"fantastic\", NOT SURE IT WAS WORTH $18, but was very good.  The server was really nice and accommodating, for example, upon the delivery of the desert, some ice cream, the runner presented a bowl with one tiny scoop in it which was $3.  When she quickly appeared to check on satisfaction 'i guess', more likely what is about to happen-happens every time this is ordered from the menu, i said, \"well, i ordered a $3 bowl of ice cream and they brought me a bowl with a small scoop of butter in it\", BUT WITH A SMILE, i do recognize she is not in charge of portions and serving sizes.  But she got a huge laugh, and took it and brought it back with a two more scoops.  So a $1 a scoop, A WIN-WIN, for all parties involved.  Two more scoops for a good laugh.  All in all, had a great time, and will definitely go back.  The only drawback was they kept bringing us menu's literally one after another, with no acceptable cadence to menu delivery.  With all the menus in front of me i thought i was a student at the library writing a research paper when most of them did not apply for the time of the visit.  BUT, i must say, if you are in the area on a wonderful day, definitely, \"make it happen\"!!!!!!...side note, they have the best looking iced coffee i have ever seen, and i don't even drink coffee!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with water view. I like the weekend Bruch here, though for dinner the choices are limited. Stuffs are nice and friendly, would come for brunch again."}
{"text":"Belle expérience en haut de la Tour Ville-Marie. Belle vue sur Montréal. Choix de plats assez limité et classique mais bons dans l'ensemble. Nous avons pris un cocktail (la sangria) qui était noyée par les glaçons et sans goût. Toutefois parmi le choix de plats \"classiques\", une fois dans l'assiette étaient très bons et originaux de part leur présentation. Les prix sont un peu plus excessifs, je pense victimes de l'emplacement \"atypique\" . Très bon service mais petit bémol : endroit très bruyant. Si prendre assez tôt pour réserver si vous voulez avoir la chance d'avoir une table"}
{"text":"Endroit a la mode,pour être vu,belle terrasse en été .nourriture et service très corrects,prix en accord avec le lieu.ma femme adore!"}
{"text":"Food and presentation wise - definitely a solid 5! The menu is well thought through, both taste and looks. The waiting staff surely knows their menu very well. 
The portions might be on a smaller side for some dishes, unusual for Montreal if you ask me, so better check with the waiting staff to not remain hungry! 
We were a little surprised about lack of beer in _brasserie_, but this is just a rather minor setback. 
Overall - definitely coming back once i have a chance :)"}
{"text":"C'était une location géniale comme introduction à Montréal - on pouvait voir toute la ville d'en haut, et le repas était de haute qualité, moderne mais avec un air de \"fait-a-la-maison\". La service était un peu lente, mais nous avons visité Samedi soir. Seule problème, on nous a dit que le dîner commençait à 17:00, quand en fait ce n'était pas prêt pour presque une demi heur plus tard. Autrement, nous étions bien plu avec cette visite."}
{"text":"Je n'ai qu'une chose à dire : Où vont-ils dénicher leur staff ? Au paradis ? Envoûtant, really. On dirait qu'ils sont allé les repêcher dans une agence de casting, no joke.

Magnifique décor mariant le verre et l'ardoise, des tables hautes et basses et une terrasse (que je n'ai pas encore étrenné cette année, faute de beau temps).
Le menu est simple et convivial, insistant sur les spécialités françaises mixées à de la bouffe de table québ. Les calmars frits étaient dégoûtants (trop cuits et caoutchouteux), mais les deux tartares que nous avons pris relevés étaient délicieux et bien dosés. J'ai entendu dire par mon petit chum que le mac n' cheese était quelque chose aussi...à voir !

A bientôt ! Enfin un restaurant potable à l'île ! C'est une révélation pour les résidents."}
{"text":"Went to the Laval location, super friendly service our waitress fixed our wobbly table without asking which was very nice.  The lunch menu was pretty bland I had fish n chip my gf had chicken Cesar.  The salad was ok pretty small portion and the fish n chips were greasy as hell even for fish n chips.  Beers selection was poor and their men's bathroom was disgusting.  Maybe the dinner menu is better but I would not recommend going there for lunch or using the bathroom.  Pretty shitty lunch experience for 60 bucks."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The view is amazing. You can order food and whole waiting just go outside to have your drink. I had a beef tartar and my friend the fish and chips. Both were amazing but I would definitely recommend the fish and chips. Amazing place to impress someone."}
{"text":"Came here in November 2017 with my boyfriend, who ended up proposing lol. I have to say the staff was extremely nice and helpful with regards to the proposal; they definitely played an important role in the whole process, so a big thank you! But, proposal aside, here are my thoughts on the place:

I had been wanting to come to Les Enfants Terribles ever since it opened earlier this year, to see the views over Montreal. However, since its basically winter now, the restaurant was all closed up (to keep the cold out) but you can still see the city, as all the walls are huge windows.

We arrived around 6:30pm, to find basically a full house and a loud crowd. The noise level went down drastically around 7pm, when the groups at the bar left (our table was in the bar section). For starters, we got the French onion soup and the salmon tartare; both were very good. For mains, we got the calamari and chorizo carbonara pasta and the strip loin steak; both were also good, Alex's steak more so than my pasta. 

Overall we had a great time and meal at Les Enfants Terribles. The food was pretty good for the most part and I would eat here again. However, I found the prices very expensive for what we got (in terms of what we ordered, the quality and the quantity); its clear that prices are hiked up because of the location of the restaurant. As well, I would definitely prefer to return in the summer, to better enjoy the views of the city.

{"text":"I really like this restaurant.

The first time I cane here was after biking for 2 and a half hours (juice fasts make you really energized!), and reaching somewhat of a dead end on our little escapade. Les Enfants Terribles was right in front of us, and after remembering all the good things I'd been told about it, we decided to pop in for dinner. 

Now, having been on a juice fast, I could only really have soup, so I ordered a bowl of the carrot ginger soup. 

Oh
My
Goodness

is all I can really say. It was like an oral explosion (ha.ha) happening with every mouthful I had of that delicious soup. I ended up ordering 2 or 3 more bowls (The waiters thought I was insane), but it was really the most amazing soup I've ever had. 

Fast forward to 5 months later, I popped in again for some solid food this time, and ordered the salmon tartare. It was quite good but..not as good as Marche 27 tartare.. Also, having been dreaming of their soup for months, I took a chance and ordered their leek soup of the day - again, absolutely phenomenal...

For dessert, I had the mini pudding chomeur which was very good (very rich).

Overall, the food and the cocktail (something watermelony) were good. I'd definitely come back to try something else off the menu (and have another soup of the day!)."}
{"text":"I really wish I could say something positive about my experience there but I have to say it as it happened. Had a reservation for a group of 12 for noon, they began taking our orders at 12:30ish (I ordered a beef tartar which comes with a salad plus fries - sold separately). I finally got my beef tartar around 1:30 (one hour later) which I had time to finish while I was still waiting for the fries, had to ask the waiter about them as he apparently had forgotten about us.... I received the fries around 1:40 had to eat quickly because you know, I had to get back to work... And of course, I never had the salad  :-/ 

Then came the time for the bills, they charged us for the salads many of us never received: The whole billing process was very confusing.

There was nothing spectacular about the food, I had better tartars... As per the view, it is very nice but it's kinda part of my daily routine. The main reason we wanted to try this place was to enjoy a great meal and have a good time at a restaurant which is located two seconds away from our office (lucky us we thought) ... I know that they have just opened, but if you choose this location, under this franchise, you do know how it works, right? Anyway, I guess that we won't be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"AWFUL service. Took an hour just until they could put our order in. We waited so long for our food we were barely hungry when it came. Not worth it."}
{"text":"La vue l'emporte sur la bouffe, la cuisine est ok, mais rien de speciale. Pour les brunch, je ne conseille pas.  La propreté sur la terasse laisse à desirer. La vue est magnifique, sans la vue je n'aurais pas pensé à y retourner. Le service est pas si pire."}
{"text":"I'll have to concur with the review left yesterday in the Montreal gazette (6 Oct 2016, same day as we were patrons). Left waiting for a long time on the terrace without being offered any service. We waited for a patio seat but despite that when we checked back were told there wouldn't be one available for a while so accepted the seats inside. Moments after we watched three tables cleared on the patio who had clearly already paid etc, so could have easily waited another minute. Hence were left by the kitchen door. Service was polite. Food was average hence very overpriced (tuna tataki salad, burger). View was nice from the terrace. Their stout was a good beer. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was at this place last Friday (July 3rd). The service was pretty good. I initially ordered the mojito and found it a bit on the weak side, so the waitress took it back and added an extra shot of rum, i appreciated that. Then I got the lychee martini, I am accustomed to this drink being somewhat clear, but they make it red (probably some coloring), but it was pretty good. As a main course, I had the baby back rib, which was nicely done, with the mean falling off the bone and BBQ sauce all over... mmmm... I recommend it.

Overall, I expected to pay more than what the bill said, so I was pleasantly surprised.

An added bonus, the second waitress we had (named Fannie, I think) was \"nice on the eyes\", if you know what I mean.

Enjoy the place."}
{"text":"Took a group of clients here and they were just in awe of the view from this place. Surprisingly busy for a Tuesday night beginning of May. Food, service and the view were all awesome. They've even added a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options since I was last there."}
{"text":"Great place to bring friends and family, especially when the weather is nice. Beautiful views, large open space, nice staff and of course.... Excellent food! I had the Charcuterie Omelette, which was perfect, and the mini pudding chômeur (a dream!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Position parfaite sur la pointe nord de l île des soeurs. Vue sur le fleuve! Carte variée et une super carte des cocktails... à decouvrir...Je vous le recommande"}
{"text":"Is it me or it seems that most businesses in Outremont are opening a second outlet in Nuns Island? Well the owner of les enfants terribles definitely chose a fantastic location to open the second restaurant!

During Burger Week MTL, we decided to go for a quick hop over the bridge from downtown for a speedy lunch. The menu offers the regular fare you would expect from a classy brasserie but the cocktail menu does seem quite intriguing! 

We ordered a couple of Thé Terribles (variation of a Long Island Ice Tea), delicious and creamy mac & cheese and (slightly overdone) burger of the week. Overall the service was fantastic - do ask for Virginie - she mixes great drinks. The meal was average but I believe owner Francine is still working out some of the kinks to make sure her team delivers consistent quality from the kitchen to the floor service. I do hope to return soon to see how this place evolves - it looks promising!"}
{"text":"Come here for the view/ambiance, not the food. 
It's located next to the fleuve st laurent and has a terrasse during summer. The view is amazing on a bright warm summer day. The restaurant itself is clean and the staff is friendly. 

However, the food is very normal. Nothing out of the ordinary that would make me crave it randomly. I came here for brunch and also for diner, but the food always failed to amaze me. The fried calamari is good. The brunch items are very normal and somwhat bland. As for diner, i had the quinoa salmon and i could've honestly cooked it better myself."}
{"text":"We had lunch last Thursday and the calamari were excessively oily! That mixture is not right it has to be with flour not egg and bread. Terrible! This terrible \"oily\" taste ruined my main dish (veal), which btw wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"Le premier mot qui me vient en tête c'est tout simplement WOW ! De manger au 44e etage de la place ville-marie c'est vraiment un trip a faire dans ca vie ! Nous avons eu de la chance le ciel etait très clair et nous avions une vue incroyable ! 

Bon j'arrete de parler de la vue c'est clairement la bouffe qui vous interesse ! Honnetement , pour le prix les plats sont excellent et les portions sont très genereuses ! J'ai éssayé les escargots en entrée et ils etaient délicieux ! 

Vous devez prendre le short ribs à la sauce hoisin en plat principal ! Ca fond dans la bouche et les gouts sont parfaitement équilibré ! 

Bref j'ai trippé !"}
{"text":"Love the location (Bernard) especially the Terrasse, however, I always felt there is something missing. 

I mean, I go there to be with friends and enjoy the outdoor but not for the food. 

I had the Foie Gras (entree) and Ribs (main)...and a few pops to enjoy a boys night out. 

Foie Gras, very tiny portion, well cooked, a bit of \"acidity\" in the after taste...hard to explain...was just not on point.

The ribs...one can find better ribs at Madison, Baton Rouge alikes...

We had a blast with the staff tho...very fun night...real first Terrasse night out of the season with the boys. We will probably return for brunch or Sunday afternoon drinks, but...been there, done that ...and the long and the short is ...Les Enfants is not my first choice, but a semi good second or third choice for your outings."}
{"text":"Great view as it is a roof top restaurant. Did not have reservation and waited for a little over an hour. We saw few open table that was vacaant for too long as the list was that long. Once we got the table, the food came pretty quick. My Ribs was superb, the pork chop and the steak is just so so."}
{"text":"J'ai teste ce restaurant dans le cadre de l'événement Mtl à table un lundi soir! 
Je pense qu'il n'a y rien à ajouter sur la vue sur Montreal....c'est sublime de jour comme de nuit! 
Et même si votre table n'est pas contre les vitres, vous aurez l'occasion, après le repas, de profiter de la vue de la terrasse contiguë au restaurant! 
J'ai beaucoup hésité entre 3/4 étoiles....
Mon entrée (chou-fleur rôti) et mon plat (pieuvre grillée avec pommes de terre) étaient tout simplement sublimes....du goût, du raffinement et du pep's! Une vraie belle surprise!
Mon compagnon était également content de ses plats: saumon fume torche et agneau braise avec purée de carottes.
Quand on a dégusté et apprécié un tel niveau de cuisine, on s'attend forcément à finir le repas en apothéose.....surtout lorsqu'on est passionné de dessert comme moi! 
Et là, le soufflé retombe très vite avec des desserts médiocres à carrément insipides! 
Je trouve dommage de galvauder le dernier souvenir avec lequel on repartira du restaurant....
Bref la tarte tatin était médiocre, quant à mon \"orange,crème à la courge rôtie, crumble aux épices, miel de sarrasin\" c'était une vraie blague....
Pas de sucre, aucun goût, le crumble n'était pas du tout épicé, et je cherche encore le goût du miel....
Bref un zéro pointé sur le dessert! 
Le service était correct! 
La salle est très bruyante et selon votre emplacement vous serez en plein courant d'air!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with nice servers. The burgers and steak are great. They have minipogos and onion soup that are really awesome too. For desert they have a really sweet pudding that's to die for. 

Service is usually good until the end. The waiters consistently forget about you after the main course is served. It's sometimes hard to get the bill. But otherwise they're all really nice. 

Saturday and sunday brunch are amazing. Their waffles are brilliant, albeit small. Recommend the breakfast poutine which is breakfast potatoes, pork shoulder, poached egg, and froyo sauce. 

They have a bar with some good drinks. During brunch I like their Mimosas. They're a bit expensive though at 10 a glass. In fact most of the food is a bit pricey but in my opinion it's pretty worth it."}
{"text":"Beautiful view at night. Wish i came around subset, would have been spectacular to see the sky. The food is very pricy, so be prepared to break out the big bucks. The rub steak was perfection. The burger was a bit dry. But overall experience was good. Very nice date night place to impress someone."}
{"text":"The server forgot about us for over 40 mins after sending us to the bar to wait for a spot on the terrasse. I had a reservation. The service was inattentive and the carbonara we ordered was undercooked. Only thing good was the view, but it got cold outside (since it was 9 by the time they seated us) so we had to move inside. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"For my second night in Montreal after a day of tourism, my friend and I decided to check out another restaurant as part of Montreal a table- Les enfants terribles on top of place ville marie!  We weren't big into alcohol but thought we would have a nice dinner and check out the view here.  

Atmosphere: 3.5/5  The restaurant was quite busy when we got there.  Thankfully we had reservations.  We were seated in the dining area but there was a bar as well. The restaurant had a modern and trendy vibe, but it was darker and louder than I would've liked.  We were also seated quite close to the tables next to us in the centre of the dining area, so it was hard to enjoy the view outside. However, after our meal, we did get out to the patio to explore a bit, which was a cool experience!

Food: 3.5/5  We ended up ordering from the MTL a table menu - I had the smoked salmon with onion, celery and artichokes, braised lamb with lemon, mushrooms, and carrot puree, and the orange and squash cream.  The salmon and lamb both tasted good, but I did wish there was more carrot puree for the lamb.  The orange squash cream was a good combination and not too sweet which I liked, however there were very big pieces of crumble on the bottom which was hard to chew.   Overall satisfactory meal.

Service: 3/5  It was very busy when we arrived, so service was a bit slower.  For example, we did not receive our bread for a long time (after the first course was served).  Overall friendly though.

Price: 3/5  Reasonable for the amt of food and view at the top

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall good experience.  I would say the food and service are average, and we came mostly for the cool view of the city, which we got a chance to check out after our meal!"}
{"text":"I recently brought a few friends to Les Enfants Terribles for lunch while they were in town visiting me, and they.. were.. blown.. AWAY! Yes! Everything from start to finish was fantastic. To top it off, it was a beautiful and sunny day, things couldn't have gotten any better.

They shared an appetizer of calamari to start and each had lamb burgers as their main course. I stole a few fries off them, they could quite possibly be the best fries I've had in Montreal - crispy, soft, hand cut and cooked to perfection. 

I ordered mini chorizo pogo's as my appetizer and the salmon tartar for my main course, which came half-smoked and fresh, mixed in with coriander, lime, salmon roe, and a few tostadas that were parked elegantly on top. On the plate there was a dash of avocado purée and a jalapeno paste. With every bite I kept going \"mmm\" and wished for it never to end.

I hear the mac & cheese is great and hearty, but quite intense! I've been aching to try the mac & lobster but definitely need someone to give it a try with me, perhaps next time. 

They never disappoint, I love this place. As always, don't forget to make reservations and if you're keen on getting a spot on their terrasse, be sure to go before (or after) typical peak hours!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. The tables felt tight and close together. I could basically listen to the party next to us and their conversation. Our waitress barely checked in on us. Food was mediocre. It took them a while to prepare it. Appetizer came out faster than our main entree. View was beautiful, despite it being foggy and snowy. It was still beautiful. The restaurant has so much potential."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend to celebrate our one year and we loved it! 
First of all, we didn't come here to look for the best food in Montreal, but instead for the experience and we loves both category. We both ordered the steak and it was juicy and delicious! The waiter was great, always smiling and took care of us like royalties :D
The view was amazing! Also, right across the restaurant you can go to the open air terrasse, and the view was even better than inside the restaurant. Overall, the food, service, view and ambiance make this place great for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Came here in my trip to Montreal and the Salmon i ordered was the best Salmon I EVER had!! It was truly amazing, a piece of work. The salmon also had quinoa at the bottom and it was the first time i ever had quinoa and honestly the whole meal was truly amazing. So happy with my meal decision. If i go back to Montreal i would definitely come back to this restaurant. Some of my favorite things consisted of 
1. The view: you can oversee the whole city 
2. Service was amazing, everyone was super friendly 
3.Creme Brûlée was to die for 
4. Mojito was huge 

The restaurant is a little pricey but the food is worth the price!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Thankfully, there was a sign and a specific elevator for this restaurant. Elevator took me all the way to summit at 44th floor. When, I arrived at the restaurant; it was packed. The hostess brought to my table. I was glad to be seated by the window. The view of Montreal was spectacular from up here. 

Our waitress came by to take our drinks order; I was little weirded out by their uniform. It is such fancy restaurant, and they are wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts... seriously? She was very nice though.

I had got grilled shrimps with watermelon and feta cheese as an entree. What a delightful dish. It was refreshing, and the spices on shrimps were dancing in my mouth. Then I ordered the burger since I read in Montreal blog, that Les Enfants Terribles have an amazing burger, but I was disappointed with it. It was over cooked that I can taste the burns mostly. In the end, I got the the pudding au chommeur, perfect way to end my meal. 

In the end, we went to observatory section, it was nice to take pics of beautiful crispy night of Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was really nice. Staff was very nice, view is beautiful. Food is good, nothing special, just really good. Drinks are delicious. It's a casual dressy place."}
{"text":"It was okay.
Screwed up both my friends orders. Nobody came to see us even tho outside had like 5 tables and 100 ppl working. Don't get the breakfast poutine looks like it cost them 3 dollars to make it. My burger was under cooked. The calamari was good but they spread the sauce on the plate to look fancy but in reality it wasn't enough. The only reason I give it 3 stars was for the water view and the French fries. It has potential but gotta step their game up."}
{"text":"This place has a spectacular view of the lovely city of Montréal and is always very busy (expect lots of tourists).  I heard very great comments on their brunch menu (but I have personally never tried).

We had a reservation for 2 at 8pm on a saturday night. Service was quick and effective, good ambiance music and a stunning sunset (prepared yourself to see everyone taking pictures all the time, you'll probably end up in a picture too!)

The food and drinks were unfortunately very average.  We got a ceasar, a contratto spritz and a margarita, they were very 're invented' but frankly the original way to do it is better or maybe if they were not going 'out of the path' too much.  We had salmon and beef tartare as entrées, it was not disgusting but didn't made us drool like we usually do when we get tartares.  

I wanted to try the lobster spaghetti but it was no longer available so I took the kale&bacon mac&cheese and added lobster on it for 15$.  My partner took the grilled contre-fillet.  For my part the mac&cheese was soooo rich I could not eat it really, so I took my time and ended maybe eating 1/4 of it, and for the lobster, there was only 3 tiny pieces.  For the contre-fillet once again, nothing disgusting but just average, no particular taste except for tons of butter.  His fries never arrived so we asked our waitor for it and he was like 'ok I'll get you that quickly and I won't charge you for it'..but it is clearly indicated in the menu that it come with fries.  So the fries arrived and they were very tiny, like rough and dry broken pieces, not very yummy.  I overheard a client at another table complaining about the same issue.  We did not take dessert because I was not feeling so well from all the richness overlead of the mac&cheese and were a bit 'bummed out' of the series of event. 

I am attaching photos of the menu because it changes every once in a while so you'll be able to see the summer 2017 seafood choices and such, as well as a picture of the fries and my mac&cheese."}
{"text":"Just had the best fish and chips of my life!!  Better than anything I had in England and Ireland!  And the red cabbage and mint slaw...I could eaten a bucket full!!"}
{"text":"I've been multiple times because everyone wants to see the view from the top of this Montreal landmark. Great view. Great location. But garbage food. I've not had a good dish and haven't heard anything but bad reviews of the food."}
{"text":"Went to brunch with my boyfriend here. The service was excellent, better than the nuns island location, and the food was good. I got the \"Monsieur Madame tout le monde\" which is eggs, bacon, fruit, toast. My boyfriend got the breakfast poutine. He used to work there and the portion was huge, they have since downsized it which is disappointing. It is still worth going for brunch. The dinner menu is fine in my opinion, but it's nothing too special."}
{"text":"Love the chain! This location is as usual + awesome view; what a patio! No reservations for the patio. On fireworks night it's quite a spot for dinner and drinks. Good work."}
{"text":"Really awesome place went for breakfast had the tiramisu waffles and they were to die for!!! Always love these types of restaurants that rethink breakfast and offer more than bacon and eggs"}
{"text":"Went out with a large group for dinner, ordered the rye lemonade alcoholic drink and to my dismay it was quite overly sweet, felt like I was drinking pure tangy sugar. Then as meal orders came around I ordered the fish & chips but as everyone received their orders mine never came. Finally when I inquired they brought it out to me a few minutes later, but not before everyone else was done eating. No apologies were made or offers of discount so that was kind of disappointing but understandable I suppose. The food was alright."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service and the atmosphere is subpar. Got the ribs to share with my boyfriend and they were really nicely cooked however. Worth going for those. In the summer, the terrace is beautiful but beware the mosquitoes."}
{"text":"Les brunchs sont plutôt délicieux, la vue est superbe par contre les repas dîner/souper laissent à désirer surtout pour le prix! La seule et unique fois que j'ai mangé un repas autre que brunch là-bas c'était un hamburger (le truc le moins chers sur le menu) et il était méga sec avec très peu de saveurs. 

D'un autre côté, je suis souvent allé déjeuner/bruncher et je n'ai jamais été déçue. Le service est courtois et rapide. 

Il faut prendre la peine de réserver d'avance car c'est un endroit très prisé mais ça vaut quand même le détour pour un premier essai si vous n'êtes jamais allé manger un pain doré chocolat et orange avec une vue du 44e étage!"}
{"text":"Les Enfants Terribles has one of the best summer terrace spots in Montreal. It's great in winter, too; I've had many a cozy meal here. The cuisine is French bistro comfort style, and I always enjoy the salmon tartare. It can get crowded and noisy, so best to reserve in advance if possible (though I've also managed to drop in and score a table). The wine list is decent, too. Afterward, walk down the street to Bilboquet for some of Montreal's best ice cream or sorbet."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great service, great food. I really wanted to come to this specific location because of the views and I wasn't disappointed. We came on a Sunday at 10:30 am and there were only a few tables, so the service was quick and super friendly. We ordered the garden omelette, crab BLT (without the B) and the orange chocolate French toast (which I was a bit hesitant about since I don't usually like the combination of orange and chocolate). Surprisingly the French toast was my highlight of the brunch! Expect to pay more than your typical brunch in Montreal, but nonetheless it was a nice splurge and will gladly return."}
{"text":"Come for: beautiful views of the entire city of Montreal, light open plan brunch place, good for families and friends, visiting Montreal 

Food: breakfast poutine- every bit as amazing as it sounds! So satisfying and wonderful. Other highlights include the mac and cheese (strange to say but the kale in it really makes it) and the monte cristo sandwich 

Ambience: beautiful!!!!! Such a cool spot to visit especially if you're just visiting or taking visitors around. I was here in the winter, but there are several open patios that I bet are great in the summer 

Service:  very attentive and warm staff"}
{"text":"We got to try this place on a work supper and having heard both good and bad feedbacks, I decided to just go with the flow...
But the flow was going very slowly... very, very slowly...
We were seated at 6.30pm and waited until 7pm for a waiter to finally come over to get our drinks orders. By that time we were starving so we told him we'd order food as well but he said he'll come back for our food order once he serves our drinks... about half an hour later... 
The cocktail menu is really nice though with a few good surprises, e.g., a bloody Mary with local alcohols yeah and some nice mocktail options.
When our food finally arrived, around 8pm, I was so hungry I kinda just shoved it down. I took a lamb and goat cheese burger with fries... The lamb was overcooked and untasty, the goat cheese simply mushy and the fries... well. I have no words to describe the fries as they were probably the worst fries I have ever eaten.
Yes, the view is great, even when it's dark and snowing. But for anyone who has walked up Mont-Royal, it's nothing you can't see there for free.
So my advice, go there for the view, grab a cocktail, enjoy it, then go eat elsewhere. The food is not worth the price and neither the (lack of) service and the view make up for that."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, great service and excellent food. They always have the freshest ingredients and are always coming up with amazing specials of the day that you will not regret."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but the service is always very slow and if you are looking for a quite place for your date. If you are looking for a business meeting, it may not be suitable because of the very slow service and it is also kind of loud."}
{"text":"Belle place. Le plats sont très bons. 

Petit mention special pour les délicieux brunches."}
{"text":"So, despite the reviews, I decided it would still be worth a look around and since I've never been to the top of Place Ville Marie, I'd at least appreciate the novelty and the view.  I found the place quite decent without lineups for the Saturday brunch time.  The food was average and my eggs Benedict tasted like they had been sitting there all morning just waiting for me to show up, that or the A/C seriously cooled it down before it made it to my table.  The earthy Benedict was rather tasty (as there was bacon in it!) and in general I'd say the food presentation is decent as well. How was the service? Nice and slow... So you better get a good window seat to enjoy the view while waiting. I would say that it's better to go to the resto and get food and a complimentary view than just to go to the observation deck alone so I would say it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"It's a nice and quiet area for a restaurant being tucked into the waterfront area of Nun's island.  The place is nice for dinner, its a nice place to bring a date! I went there after a day at Strøm spa-also on Nun's island. I ordered the entrée of salmon tartare and the shepherd's pie. The food has a nice presentation and the portions are quite large.  The main was a bit on the salty side but I was able to eat it for two meals-supper and then for lunch the next day! My friend had the AAA burger but without the extras on it, it wasn't that enjoyable, I wouldn't say it looked better than an average burger.  Desserts menu sounded really good but I was too full to try.  Overall, alright, I think it probably had a reputation and that's what keeps it going, in addition to perhaps being a popular touristy spot."}
{"text":"Cette brasserie bistro à la déco trendy (mais pas prétentieuse) avec des murs en bois, offre une gamme de plats très savoureux. Mon préféré étant le tartare de saumon (14$ d mémoire). Le personnel est aussi très aimable et très prévenant.
Et j'aime aussi beaucoup le concept de la cuisine ouvert. Attention, par contre ce resto est TOUJOURS plein, même en semaine, alors pensez bien 
Toujours plein même en semaine donc mieux vaut réserver à réserver!!!"}
{"text":"Les enfants terribles has always been on my must try brunch list. You already feel extra fancy going up the elevator to the 44th floor, but the you haven't seen the view yet. The view on the terrasse is just wooow! Surprisingly, everything on the menu was not expensive at all, although the deco and the view looks really fancy. I checked their dinner menu, and let's say I am glad I came for lunch, coz the price range for dinner is a lot higher than that of the brunch. I went there with my family and ordered pretty much a bit of everything from the brunch and lunch menu.
- Fish taco: You really need to squeeze in some lime because it can taste a bit bland and boring. I love the texture of the fish, it was almost like shrimps as it was actually really chewy. It comes in hard shell tacos, although I would have prefered soft ones. Was not blown away, was ok.
- AAA Beef Burger: Ordered this for my uncle. He let me have some, and I must say the patty was really bland, not even juicy. The fries were soso. Really disappointed.
- Smoked salmon egg benedict: After I tried l'Avenue's benny eggs I don't think any other places can do it better. 
- Breakfast poutine: Probably the best thing I ordered at the place. The sauce was really good, not sure what they put in it had an after taste of beer somehow. The pulled pork in the poutine was amazing, flavorful with a hint of sweetness. The cheese on top was delish although it hardened afterwards... I wish they put in more dauce though because at the end tbere was nothing to eat the potato with. 
- Salmon tartar: Tasted good, but was not woow. They only give us two pieces of chips/nachos to eat the tartar with. Wish they give some more lol
- Charcuterie: The platting was great, super instagramable. Came with 2 slices of toasts. The platter was really diverse and they had different kind of sauces and pickles on the side
- Jus the vie: Loved the drink! Was super good with just the right amount of sweetness
- Rose cheesecake: Was like the cherry on top of the sundae, made us end the meal nicely. Not too heavy, the cheesecake was actually light and fluffy in texture, not too condensed. And the sauce poured on top did have rose aroma.
If I want to impress a friend I will probably bring them there because the view is truly nice, but I cant say the same for the food. Still prefer l'Avenue more. I will probably try their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"I must say that they upped their game.  I was with a group that was going there so had to go. The service was much better as was the food. I am guessing that they have been reading the negative comments and decided to grow. Oh and the Margaritas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Vraiment un mauvais service, serveurs sans expérience sans le soucis du détail, oh et passant chère serveuse, pour une table à 350$ (un midi), aurais-tu plus un peu plus nous ignorer (sarcasme) ?  Nourriture ordinaire et très peu relevée. Y a que la vue qui est extraordinaire, malheureusement ils n'y sont pour rien!"}
{"text":"The elevators were a bit hard to navigate but it was worth it. Spectacular views. We came for a work lunch and sat at a corner table. The ambiance was fun and the staff was very good. Steak Tartare was high quality and the pasta Carbonara had a slight twist without straying too far. It was thankfully not over salted. Pudding Chomeur was the rich decadence it should be. And a decent espresso topped it off."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, chat and look around Montreal. Had a great time and a place to look forward when coming to Montreal."}
{"text":"Interesting takes on classic dishes like mac&cheese and pâté chinois, but overpriced (and overhyped?). Excellent blood sausage. Very slow service. Great terrasse. A real mixed bag, but too pricy - we won't be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a breathtaking view of Montreal this is the place to go! I've been here a couple of times either in small groups or to have a drink with a friend at the bar. After ordering from the menu for the first time it starts seeming slightly restricted in choice. They offer a small selection of appetizers, pastas, vegetarian, meat, fish and sides. This time around I ordered the ribs which come with a side of coleslaw salad and your choice of fries or salad. The meal was good but unfortunately nothing to rave about which is why I am giving it 3 stars. Personally, for a place in that location, the food should be up to par (not ro say that it is not good!)
For a Tuesday evening it was a busy night, and the service lagged a little at the beginning (to order drinks and to get them) and towards the end (for the bill). The food however was brought quickly :)
Overall I am giving this 3 stars only mostly because i think the food could be much better, but still a great choice to go for drinks and enjoy the summer days and a beautiful view of Montreal!"}
{"text":"After a few strokes at finding a venue for my birthday with friends, I ended up making a reservation for 7 on a Saturday night.

The place looks quite trendy and there was the crowd to prove it! 

Service people were very nice and polite but the service itself was long and uneven. Some at the table had to ask for their drinks and no one came around for the refills.

The sound level was unbearable to me... yeah yeah, go ahead and say it! I'm getting old! But thing is, when you can't hear the person sitting in front of you, to me, its not at all interesting to stay and have desert.

The food was good though; I had a charcuterie plate and beef tartar for the main course. Not sure why I had to ask for croutons to eat with the tartar, seems a bit much to eat it on its on.  But it was good. Many people of my party had the fish and chip and they all liked it. 

The food is the reason why i'm giving it a 3 stars, but i will definitively not go back there on a Saturday night ever again!"}
{"text":"This place is a 'terrible' addition to the Laval Centropolis restaurant scene. 

My Salmon and Spinach Eggs Benedict was horrible; where do I even begin? Firstly, my English Muffins had burnt edges, the poached egg was overcooked and not runny, the hollandaise sauce was ghastly (overcooked and turned into scrambled eggs), the spinach lacked seasoning and the potatoes seemed out-of-a-frozen-pack (correction: frozen McCain potatoes are MUCH better). 

Oh and the menu is really unimaginative and the prices don't justify the quality and dishes. 

The hubby wasn't too happy with his burnt omelet or the giant oversized bread that it came with. 

The service was atrocious. They didn't give us any ketchup for the potatoes nor offered any pepper for hubby's eggs. I will never go back - I'd give this place one stars but I added an extra star because the decor was nice and I'm feeling generous. I preferred Pollo restaurant which closed down and this resto took its place."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but it was pricey for the quality. If you have your heart set on balsamic for your bread (as one of my friends did) you'll be disappointed when what is closer to a cider vinegar hits the table. The calamari is decently priced, but slightly oily and lacking a little crisp to the batter. The salmon tartare is good but not out of this world. The portion of Mac and cheese was slightly small when you choose it as a main. The biggest let down for me was the charcuterie board. Really not worth the price.
The drinks here are great if you want something that has a kick to it; they're quite strong. The wine list was standard but I was happy with it."}
{"text":"What a beautiful terrace!! I've been there for brunch on a sunny day and it was perfect! I had the salmon bagel. Half way during my meal, I've noticed a strand hair in the bagel. I called the waiter and he took it back. I got a second salmon bagel. They make sure the client is satisfied with their meals and they definitely have my approval on this. We went there on a Sunday with reservation. Lots of people taking pictures outside. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow! Je suis allé bruncher là-bas sans rien m'attendre vraiment. Je me disais que c'était un autre restaurant typique de brunch du Mile-End. Damn, j'avais tort!

Le menu est varié, proposant plein de déjeuners normaux, mais ils ont aussi des spécialités maison qui sortent de l'ordinaire. Lors de mon passage, j'ai pris la poutine déjeuner. WOW. WOWOWOW. C'est un beau mélange de déjeuner traditionnel (oeufs et patates) et avec une variante originale : sauce poutine avec une sauce béchamel (ou dequoi du genre). 

Bref, ce fût un brunch vraiment différent qui m'a remplit le ventre en maudit.

Le décor est bien aussi, en plus il y a une terrasse."}
{"text":"My second time visiting the restaurant because we want to show our friend from Edmonton the view of Montreal. Pretty disappointed about the Mtl à table 3 courses menu. The salmon appetizer was ok. The lamb was way too dry and not seasoned enough. The dessert was ok. The service was very slow. Our friend didn't get his rib till we all got our dishes and started to eat ( it was so slow to the point the dishes would get cold if we waited for him longer). Overall, the tasting menu is 41$ before taxes and tips. Definitely not worth it and I'll probably not return if it's not for the view."}
{"text":"La vue est extraordinaire! La nourriture est bonne! Les cocktails intéressants et délicieux! 
MAIS, il y a souvent un mais, le service est terrible! Et pas dans le bon sens! Attendre  à la porte pendant plus de cinq minutes alors que l'hôtesse parle au téléphone! Et ce, malgré une réservation sur internet qui devait même être confirmé par téléphone! Et quelle attitude condescendante! 

Nos cocktails qui sont arrivés après notre repas! Et ceci, malgré une demande d'attendre 10 minutes avant de donner notre commande de nourriture à la cuisine pour nous donner une chance de se retrouver, se parler et rire un peu! 

La serveuse semblait débordée mais polie et désolée de ces difficultés. Elle nous a offert une mousse au chocolat pour célébrer l'anniversaire de naissance de mon amie. Très beau geste! Bien apprécié!"}
{"text":"Excellent restau, excellent emplacement quand le ciel est dégagé :) A faire quand on visite Montréal!
Prix un peu cher."}
{"text":"We ended up there for a work lunch. I never knew this place existed.

The good: Great view of the city! Food was also great. Nice presentation of the plates. Technically the food was nice and view terrific. Oh and waiting time for plates reasonable.

The bad: Staff young and always in the way. Staff also knocking stuff off the tables as they walked. Chairs very low compared to table height. Can be a loud place. If \"outside\" seating wasn't available, would be a very small restaurant. Menus (especially desserts) are falling apart.

In the end, the food is great and view terrific. But the rest does not make it a high quality place."}
{"text":"One in our group of 6 did not receive his meal until 20 minutes after everybody finished eating, making this brunch our most awkward and cold meal in a loooong time! 

The excuse was that the hollandaise sauce had to be done again, 2 minutes sir. Lol ! While waiting, the waiter was not offering food. I asked the waiter what they can do to make this feel good. They decided to not charge one meal. The manager did not come to see us to present some basic excuses. They don't seem to know what to do when a problem arise.

Go for the view or go to the one in Outremont, where they know service."}
{"text":"Vraiment superbe, surtout pour la vue. Je m'attendais à payer plus cher que les autres succursales à cause de l'endroit (en haut de la Place Ville-Marie) mais non! Même menu et même prix qu'aux autres Enfants Terribles. Allez-y pour le brunch ou pour un souper romantique le soir. Bouffe très correcte et personnel très souriant et empressé, comme aux autres succursales, selon mon expérience. Nous y sommes allés avec un groupe de 15 pour un brunch anniversaire et le service a été impeccable avec une serveuse avec un très beau sourire et une très belle attitude.  A essayer"}
{"text":"Myself and 5 others came here for lunch on a Friday around 1pm. We did not have reservations, but luckily we were seated without any problem. The decor is trendy and it seemed like the happening lunch spot for the corporate types. We sat indoors, but obviously the big draw is the view which can be enjoyed both from the inside and outdoors on the patio. The lunch menu isn't incredibly extensive, but they have a little bit for everyone. We very much enjoyed the warm bread that was served to the table (twice!) For my entree I had a garden salad with grilled shrimp with a lemon vinaigrette dressing. It was a fine meal with fine service. At least go for a drink and the view."}
{"text":"In brief, been there three times, the food is ok, nothing special. The service is terrible, very very slow and got us the wrong order twice, once with drinks and another time with food, I had to wait for the right order to come, took them half an hour to produce an omelet!!!! by the time they served it ( hooray )I ate alone as everybody else finished their food!"}
{"text":"Overall this was a very disappointing experience. 

First, the pros: the view. You don't need to explain it more than that. It's exceptional. The appetizers were inventive and delicious. 

The cons: it's slow. Slow slow slow. We had a reservation made weeks ago and they were still an hour late seating us. By the time we had food in front of us it was almost 1h 45m after the start of our reservation.   The service was polite but uninterested. As I said above, the appetizers were well visioned. But the mains were disappointing. The sides - french fries (cold) and salad (over dressed) were nothing special. The mains - at our table the steak, veal chop, pasta and fish - all had issues, mostly with seasoning and temperature. 

Honestly for what we paid for the meal and for what is available in Montreal to eat, even with the view  this place is worth skipping."}
{"text":"Quel dommage ! Un beau décor à l'intérieur très bien refait, une carte alléchante et courte, une bonne compréhension des bons plats brasseries, certains plats à prix accessible et un beau choix d'entrées qui peuvent facilement se partager, une équipe gentille et aimable en salle pour le service, mais ..... que de maladresses.

Première expérience : à trois adultes, nous commandons nos plats et une bouteille de vin à 25 dollars, à deux reprises on nous apporte une bouteille à 85 dollars au nom très proche. Heureusement nous avons eu un doute et pu arrêter la serveuse avant d'ouvrir la bouteille. Il a fallu s'entêter, quelques minutes plus tqrd, on nous représentait la même bouteille au prix fort.

Deuxième expérience, ce soir : motivés à réussir un bon moment au restaurant en famille, nous venons avec plaisir. Je ne pourrais malheureusement pas partager les photos que j'aurai voulu montrer sur Yelp. Au bout d'1h15, les plats pourtant simples (burgers et côtes levées) n'arrivant toujours pas, nous partons, en réglant une entrée consommée. Le serveur, très ennuyé, vient nous rechercher dans la rue, nous propose d'emporter les plats ou les manger sur place, ils seraient prêts. D'accord, on part sur la boîte à emporter et on règle, le serveur fera un geste sur une partie de la note, il essaie de rattraper. Nous réglons et les boîtes arrivent 10 mn plus tard. 1h30 au total, on mangera à la maison.

Bien dommage, un restaurant qui a des atouts, mais 4 clients de moins pour un petit moment. La cuisine n'est pas équipée pour suivre, l'affluence est trop dense, les serveurs gentils sont maladroits et impuissants, bon courage."}
{"text":"So despite being a Yelper, I totally did not know about this place (or about the Observatoire for that matter). My husband took me here for a surprise anniversary dinner and I fell in love. He knows my love for architecture, bridges & skylines so this definitely was the best place to bring me. 

I don't understand the bad reviews? What is not to like? The interior is absolutely gorgeous - black and white with rustic themes contrasting against the sleek modern look of curtain walls & chandelier-type uplighters on tables.

We were escorted to a great table with the perfect 180 view. The tables are super close to each other so it's a tight squeeze as many chairs and tables have been crammed onto the terrace. We ordered the grilled shrimp served on a bed of feta & watermelon for starters - very tasty but quite a small portion. For my main course, I had the fish & chips which I was extremely impressed by! Coming from the country where Fish & Chips is a staple food, many places here have failed to impress me. But this one gets my vote! The cod was covered in a perfect thick & crispy batter, the fries were delicious and the accompaniments just enhanced the flavours more - a unique coleslaw with coriander, super tasty! I also had the meli melu, a watermelon mojito type cocktail. It was OK, would not order again. Service was great, despite it being a weekend evening and prices were surprisingly reasonable for such a location. 

The best part of the evening? We dined whilst witnessing the gorgeous sun set over Mont Royal... it was magical, the terrace was bathed in hues of oranges & pinks... suddenly everything looked perfect under a real-life Instagram-type filter moment!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review while actually still being inside the restaurant.
It has been 2 hours since we've been seated and we are still waiting on our food to come to the table.
The waitress has explained to us three times now that it was a very busy night and they had two groups of 25 people to serve. 
I'm not in the restaurant business but I'm fairly certain groups of 25 people don't show up unannounced and actually reserve in advance. So just plan ahead and make sure you have enough people to handle everything in the kitchen instead of just telling your customers it's taking 2 hours to open 12 oysters because there are too many people  in the room and you can't manage your fucking restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with nice music but abysmal service and food for the price. Took us over an hour to get main courses, were told it's because we ordered appetizers (?) without an apology. Busboys look like they're 12 and have 0 prior experience, experience wise the same goes for the waiters. Expect an OK portion of average quality food, not worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch since a lot of people were raving about this place. I wasn't impressed at all. I didn't find the menu appealing at all and the  taste didn't match up the price. It is definitely too expensive for what you're getting. People there are loud, you can really eat peacefully, and the tables are kind of squeezed next to each other. The service isn't that bad out I still found it a little bit messy. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"We ordered the steak and Mac & cheese... it was not bad. Drinks were strong, which is not a bad thing! The view was spectacular! I would recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Quel site pour un restaurant sur le toit de PVM ! Aménagement intéressant, belle terrasse extérieure et ambiance décontractée. Menu limité, mais très bien préparé. Service attentionné, mais surchargé."}
{"text":"En ce beau dimanche ensoleillé, nous étions deux et n'avions pas réservés sur le site internet, il n'y avait plus de choix, mais il était indiqué qu'ils gardaient des places pour les personnes qui ne réservent pas ! 
Effectivement, l'hôtesse à cherché à nous accommoder et nous proposé le bar...  D'autant plus que nous avions demandé à l'accueil du Rez-de-chaussée, si nous pouvions monter au restaurant. 
D'ailleurs, l'hôtesse avait l'air surprise que l'on nous laisse monter...

Le restaurant n'était pas complètement plein ! J'ai remarqué 6 tables de deux et presque autant de quatre, qui n'ont jamais été occupées durant tout notre brunch. 

La vue est magnifique, mais c'est certain que j'aurai préféré être plus proche des vitres, sur une des six tables qui est restée inoccupée.
Une chance qu'après le repas, il soit possible de s'asseoir en terrasse pour contempler la ville. 

Le service à été très courtois, mais un peu long, 30 minutes d'attente entre la commande et l'arrivée des plats, mais nous avions pris des cocktails qui sont arrivés rapidement, ce qui nous a permis de patienter et la serveuse, nous a proposé un café dès que nous nous sommes installés.

J'ai pris des ufs bénédictines et contrairement à la succursale d'Outremont (1257 Rue Bernard) où la sauce hollandaise ressemblait à de l'eau, ici, il s'agissait plus d'une mayonnaise au beurre. Un des deux ufs était également trop cuit (le jaune be coulait pas)...

On pourrait espérer un certain standing de ce restaurant, de nettes améliorations seraient à prévoir !

J'avais l'impression d'être en seconde classe... Pourtant les tarifs sont les mêmes !
J'y retournerai, probablement pour faire découvrir la vue, mais je n'y mangerai pas..."}
{"text":"Organization of the restaurant ruined the experience. The man at the entrance was the rudest most obnoxious human I've ever seen. 
I'm disgusted the way he was treating every customer. 
People complained why there was a huge line up by the elevator and no organization or employees outside. He blandly said I didn't have time to deal with customers so I left the elevator blocked so you wait outside not in my restaurant...

The view was phenomenal, it's the old 737. The mojito with maple syrup was on point ( wish it was in a mojito glass not a Stella beer glass )
The calamari was perfect, not chewy. Also had the rack of ribs that fell off the bone.


Update: Decided to take out a few first during F1 week here since it was their first time.

Again service was horrible that I have to drop this to 1 Star.
Out of the group of 6. 1 person didn't receive their food till 20minutes after the 4 of us and the last person for it 5min after them... our food was cold since our of respect we didn't start eating till everyone had their food and the waiter promised it was on its way. 
They also completely screwed up the bills. I can understand the mix up of people but it wasn't even the right items on the bill."}
{"text":"Super endroit pour voir une belle vue sur Montréal.

Je suis aller bruncher avec des amis un dimanche et je dirais que l'endroit et sympa mais qu'il est vraiment bruyant.

J'ai un une chachouka avec sauce tomate, des merguez et un uf miroir qui était très bon mais pas assez copieux, tout est noyé dans la sauce mais ceci dit j'ai apprécié.

Le bémol en plus du bruit que je dirais c'est que le service est long"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I would go there again is for the views, it is absolutely gorgeous.However,  It took an hour and half for us to get our food. I mean, I get it, you guys are busy and have a nice view but seriously? An hour and half later and the food came out cold and not that good"}
{"text":"Went there for a  casual super with my family and was extremely disappointed. Food choice and quality was very poor. Rather tasteless and overpriced for quality you get. 
 
However the service was great and the atmosphere was nice. We also ordered a couple of drinks (bloody Ceasar, sangria) which were amazing.

I definitely do not recommend this place unless you're going there for a drink."}
{"text":"So LabourDay Sunday brunch was spent with an awesome view..and thank goodness for the view because My friend and I waited over 40minutes for our food to be served ... and all we ordered were simple eggs Benedict ... Which came with a small jar of fruits (melons), breakfast potatoes and thats all... Nothing fancy... At the end of the service, our waitress Justine asked us whether we would like Coffee... My friend and I said yes... Only to find out that we were entitled to coffee all during breakfast (which is included with the meal) but was never offered earlier... Really disappointed... Especially since we made reservations a few days prior and made sure to show up hungry... The answer to our 'why did we have to wait sooo long? And are going to get comped* for something.. At least something?' ... our waitress:\" there is nothing I can do' ... Wow! Smh ..."}
{"text":"Great food. We were 8 with 4 terrible children among which 7 cleaned up the plates. Putines, pancake, pain doree, poached eggs and cheese macaroni all great. Service impeccable wit smiling waiters. Will come again. Nice xmas deco outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Super brasserie. Bon service, cadre trendy. La terasse est très agréable quand il fait beau. La salade betterave chèvre chaud est un must!"}
{"text":"It's much better now with very good staff/service! The food is really good and they are much more child-friendly. The ambiance is amazing as usual, with views of the river, and park."}
{"text":"Good food. Good wine. But nothing outstanding.
I do go there regularly because it's a great no-fuss kind of place ; meaning that you can have a great time regardless of your taste in food. I would almost qualify it as a good ''hang out'' place. I've been dressed up, and i've been dressed casually. 
Not ideal for a first or second date - but great for a night out with friends.

I recommend the beet salad. They also have great fries.
Service is acceptable."}
{"text":"Popped in early on a Friday evening to cure a hangover; had a huge craving for a substantial burger and fries. An understatement would be to say that they delivered. Not only was the service so friendly and sweet (we had a particularly attentive and happy waiter) but the food was totally excellent to boot. I would absolutely recommend this place (haven't been to the other two locations but would happily go) to anyone. Good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance and location, we got a table near the bar. The place feels very classy and felt like typical Quebecer-French restaurant, with items from multiple nationalities on the menu with a North American twist.

I had the chorizo mini-pogos, accompanied by yellow mustard. Three fried bites that were very good. 

Their bread comes from Première Moisson, one of the regular buns. 

As a main, I had their \"famous beet and warm goat cheese salad\". The huge chunk of goat cheese came on a bed of arugula, which was topping the marinaded beets. There were also 4 slices of sour dough bread. Overall, simple but effective dish that I polished off. For one of their house-specialities, I was expecting a bit more of a \"wow\" factor, which was lacking. But everything was indeed very tasty.

Their portions tend to run on the small side, although most of the menu features \"comfort food\" items, such as Shepherd's Pie, Mac 'n Meat, etc.

Because it is busy, they do tend to try to move their customers along once dessert/coffee is consumed, so not the best place for late night discussions.

It's a bit on the pricier side for what you are getting."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times in the summer i really enjoy the terrace the ambiance is just great. The food on the other hand is ok, not bad not great. Its the perfect place to hang out, have a drink with friends and eat a few appetizer plates."}
{"text":"I am surprised by all the bad reviews for this pretty great and unique restaurant. I have gone to Les Enfants Terribles on multiple occasions: brunch inside, brunch on the terrasse, drinks...and have found it to be great in a consistent manner throughout these visits. 

First of all, let me highlight one point people seem to forget: the prices are not any higher than if this restaurant was at the street level (!) Have you ever been to a restaurant up in the sky that did not charge you three times the amount you would have paid otherwise? The prices are reasonable for the food you're getting and on top of that you get to enjoy an amazing view!

The dishes and drinks I've had all tasted good, although not extraordinary, and my friends and family were always very satisfied with their meals. The service was always courteous and I have never had a any sort of problem. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who's never gotten to enjoy such a view!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for 19:30 and were seated at 20:15. We were seated close to the POS system used print out bills. My friend was standing by her chair and one of the waiters pushed her aside to get to the POS system without any apology.

It was clear that the waiter did not want to be there. He came back to our table four times due to complete orders being forgotten multiple times. We were only eight. We had to wait a total of 30 minutes from the first person getting her food and the last.

I got the salmon tartare as an entrée and one of my friends got it as a main course. The salmon tartare entrée and main course were the same size, except it came with with slightly more corn chips and lime wedges, as well as a salad. The salmon tartare was bland and textureless. We were disappointed with the food and even more so with the service."}
{"text":"best meal we had in Montreal! this was our first visit to the island city (a surprise for my husbands 30th bday). We made this our last meal of the trip and though we bixi'ed in the rain it was so worth it! We ordered the cod fritters, the grilled chicken salad (holy sh*t), the macaroni and cheese, and the market fish and chips of the day. It was pretty silly that it was soooo good. We lounged in the almost empty restaurant (it was about 3pm) and before we knew it we made a mad dash out of there to catch our flight! Literally it was so good and such a pleasant experience that we lost track of time. THE END.  

p.s. shout out to the lemonade!!"}
{"text":"The view is absolutely wonderful with a very nice modern atmosphere. Another positive is the next door terrace which gives and even better view of the cityscape.  Food is average and service is on the slow side. 

Overall, it is a restaurant worth going for in order to enjoy the view, but  I would not make a detour there if I was seeking a culinary experience."}
{"text":"Belle proposition de plats : une sélection de plats classique pour un brunch mais aussi des plats originaux et spécifiques à ce restaurant.
Les assiettes sont pleines et le goût est bien présent. Le rapport qualité/prix était très bon. Le service était de très bonne qualité."}
{"text":"I just love Montreal this time of year. All the sidewalk cafes to really enjoy people watching, enjoy a class of wine or beer and just take in all the gloriousness Montreal has to offer. This is my first time here. My family and I are here for our Nephews wedding. We just drove 5 hours from Boston and were starving and needed to sit and relax while enjoying a glass of wine. I just love the name of this place. So quirky. Trust me we were far from being \"Terrible Children\" which is what \"Les Enfant Terribles\" means. Lol. We were well behaved. We waited about 15 min to be seated, our waitress was sweet and attentive. And don't worry if you can't speak French, they speak both. We ordered 2 different carafes of wine, red and white. Our food was amazing especially the Pâte Chinois with truffle oil. Wow! Amazing. 
What I really love about most restaurants in Montreal is that even if the food isn't that great, the presentation is stellar and top notch!! 
The prices of course is très cher, but it's well worth the visit. 
If you're ever here, pay a visit. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a cocktail and a cheese plate here recently and they were both excellent, and I noticed a couple other things I thought maybe worth mentioning. For one, 6pm and the place started to fill up with families! In a high end bistro with a big central bar this wasn't really something I was expecting, I hadn't realized this Brasserie had a kids menu! Let alone a well developed menu clearly devoted to kids' taste with mini burgers, mac n' cheese, fish n' chips, chicken fingers. The parents seemed to settle into this dim and amazing smelling resto, order a glass of wine and a very nice meal and glow with gratitude while their kids happily mellowed out as well while they picked their favourites. 

Let's be clear - kids menu items are all around $10 so this is definitely not budget dining, it's Outremont families doing their thing, but for what it is, it's smart and welcoming. 

One thing that bugged me: I told the person at the door that I just wanted to have a drink at the bar and she said go ahead, and only after I'd ordered a drink did the bartender realize I hadn't been told that I had to eat if I was drinking - they have one of those licenses. This would really have pissed me off if the cheese plate I ordered wasn't exceptional. Great cheese and homemade pickles and beat mustard heal most errors caused by bad service in my experience."}
{"text":"Someone suggested meeting here for lunch on a Saturday and since I've never been here, I decided to give them a try after checking out their website.

To get to Les Enfants Terribles, you have to go to what I consider the RBC area/section of Place Ville Marie. There are signs within the main PVM complex so it is almost impossible to get lost. Once you get to the RBC area/section of Place Ville Marie, you take the elevators, get out of the elevators and take another elevator to get up to the floor where Les Enfants Terribles is located.

We were asked if we had a reservation and we mentioned that we didn't and we were asked if we had an issue with sitting at the bar. We didn't so we were seated immediately.

I ordered the fish & chips while the person that I was with ordered a fruit salad. I found the fish and chips to be very good. The fries were the type of fries that I liked (cut potatoes and didn't seem like they were purchased pre-cut from a grocery store). The fruit salad looked tasty as well.

The washroom/toilet was relatively clean and well maintained. It is located outside the restaurant where you have to go past the elevator.

After eating, we went to the outside to take a look at the view and take a few pictures. To prevent accidents or possibly jumpers, the entire area is enclosed behind glass so pictures don't really show an unobstructed view of the city as the windows weren't \"crystal clean\" on the day that we went due to the weather (but pictures were still nice)

Going to and leaving the restaurant, I found that the elevator can get very crowded which was a minor inconvenience."}
{"text":"It's rather a new resto in Centropolis Laval. The atmosphere is friendly and there is a good vibe about the place.  The price is $$, the staff is nice but the food is very oily.  The drinks are ok but lacks zest 
 My bloody ceazar was too strong & lacked imagination"}
{"text":"Belle petite terrasse à Outremont. J'y suis allée pour le brunch un samedi matin sans réservation. Aucune attente à 10:00 et nous étions assises à l'intérieur mais près des portes patios grandement ouvertes et donnant sur la terrasse. La terasse s'est remplie lentement mais le restaurant était presque vide. Le menu du brunch est...menue, seulement quelques choix. Ma compagne a pris les oeufs bénédictines, qu'elle me dit avoir adoré. J'ai pris un plat bien ordinaire d'oeufs, petit pain grillé et saucisse. En effet, le plat était bien ordinaire. Je crois qu'il y a de bien meilleurs endroits pour le brunch. Toutefois, ambiance agréable sur la terasse lors d'une belle journée d'été. Idéal pour prendre un simple café et lire le journal, pourquoi pas?!"}
{"text":"Fun spot to come to see a cool view of the city. It's obviously on the pricey side of things so I generally stick to just grabbing a drink with colleagues after work. The venue is nice. What you're paying for is the location more than anything else. The bartenders are nice."}
{"text":"Always a nice time whether for brunch or dinner. Lovely terrace setting in warm weather! They even sent over a special dessert for my birthday this fall :) much appreciated"}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant many times and have always wanted to give it a shot and last night I finally made it a reality. It has a very nice decor and a beautiful sidewalk terrace. Although I had not made a reservation I was lucky enough to get a table. I was greeted very politely by the hostess and received a nice table on the sidewalk terrace. My waitress was very friendly and seemed to be very accessible throughout my dining experience. I ordered the half portion Mac and cheese as a starter and a beef burger as my main. I have to say both my dishes tasted great. The only complaint I had about this restaurant was that I had to wait 45 minutes to receive my meal. It really spoiled my whole meal as I kind of lost my appetite while waiting for my meal. If only my meal came within a reasonable timeframe I would be really happy with this restaurant however it didn't and I wasn't offered any sort of compensation nor an apology.  Hopefully if you give this restaurant a chance you won't have to go through the same experience as I did."}
{"text":"Super nice resto in Outremont!! The owner is there \"all\" the time, she is very involved, finding us seats, telling us what her \"coup de coeur\" and she is right, we recommended the soup last time, and it was absolutely amazing!!
We had the beet salad, fabulous with the warm goat cheese!! Plus the Jaret d'agneau also the fish was fantastic!! 
I like the long U shape bar, this is always my favorite place to sit! 
One BIg plus is that her staff has been to the \"ecole hoteliere\" so they know how to serve people and now about food, big plus in my book!!
Cant wait to go back!! 
Tres charmant!! :)"}
{"text":"D'abord, WOW! L'emplacement du restaurant mérite un 10/5 ! C'est tellement beau et magique comme expérience! Au 44e étage de la place ville-marie, le restaurant donne vu sur Montréal au complet ! C'est vraiment magique et impressionnant (et je ne suis pas une fan finie des gratte-ciel en passant, c'est juste trop trop beau) 

La bouffe est très bonne aussi! Nous avons pris les huîtres en \"pré\" entré ; un délice! Les entrées étaient toutes aussi bonnes! Je vous conseille le boudin!!!!!! Les repas sont copieux et vous serez certain de ne JAMAIS manquer de bouffe! C'est un vrai festin! 

Finalement, le personnel est très courtois et le service est vraiment impeccable ! Vous ne manquerez jamais d'eau dans votre verre ! ;)"}
{"text":"Go for the brunch view
Get the long island ice tea 
Bloody mary* too

*not technically called that but there's a bloody d'ici that has 3 different liquors and tastes amazing"}
{"text":"I am surprised by their 3.5 star review. I rarely rate something 5 stars unless it truly is (in my mind).  Since I am basically a tourist I can't tell you much about the area except that it was fairly close to the Outremont metro station and the neighborhood was very cute and quaint.

So we started off by sitting outside which was the best thing that could have happened. Such a beautiful night! I got their lemonade, kind of pricey but after tasting it can totally see why. It was the best lemonade I've ever had, I asked for some vodka in it, which they did and you can't taste it, but I sure felt it.

We then split a fried calamari and gazpacho. Both were delicious and the calamari was perfectly crisp!

For the main course I got the lamburger with fries. Seriously, get this if you like lamb. My friend got the fish and chips which was really good as well. Seriously, everything I put into my mouth here was really good and worth it."}
{"text":"My first time at LET and I will definitely be going back.  The occasion was a family birthday, and everything we ordered was delicious.  The service was prompt and attentive, great cocktails, warm atmosphere without being overly loud, and the food was delicious!

I would especially recommend the beet salad and poudding chomeur!"}
{"text":"Was reluctant to go there again after a very bad initial experience I had last summer when I went for diner shortly after it's opening. The big issue at the time was the lack of organization and the service that took forever. Food was alright.

This time I went for brunch on a beautiful and sunny Sunday. The place was full but we were immediately assigned to our table which was at the window with an amazing view. The food again was good however the service was still below expectations for a place like this; lots of comings and goings with waiters forgetting coffees and beverages and coming back to double check on the order..

The prices are affordable for what you eat.

In my opinion, the only factor making this place popular is its location on the last floor of the Ville Marie Bldg with an amazing view on Mtl"}
{"text":"You come here for the view. The view = 5 stars. The service = 2 stars. We had two wait 20 Minutes for our table despite having a reservation. Then, we waited almost an hour for the food to arrive. The food was fine, but really salty. If they worked out their service issues, the stars would increase. But don't go here if you are hungry. :)"}
{"text":"Great location right on top of the building roof terrace with beautiful panoramic views of Mount Royal and St. Helene island the dishes were very good although the flanked  steak was hard to chew and the knife was not sharpened drinks are amazing but the waiters need to work quicker but the place is highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love their outdoor terrace and their brunch! Its in a lovely neighbourhood, however didnt know that they only served brunch in the weekends. The food is very delicious, but its kind of expensive. Would definetely suggest it for a nice getaway from downtown Montreal for brunch in the weekend with amazing food."}
{"text":"PRO TIP: I came alone and was able to get a spot at the bar but for two or more who want to get a table, highly recommend to reserve a table no matter if it's weekend or weekday because it's a popular spot. 

The food is pretty good and then there's the view of Montreal that you can't get much anywhere else. 

Got the lamb shank and poutine. The lamb came right off the bone and was cooked well enough that you get the flavor of the lamb but it w asn't too too gamey.The poutine was standard and the service at the bar was pretty good. 

Go into place ville marie and find the elevator with their logo; it brings you all the way up, switch elevators then go up again.
Overall I would come back here again, would recommend because of the good service too!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful view, breathtaking! 
If you are a tourist or simply want one of Montreal's best view, here it is!

Apart from the view, the food at \"Les Enfants terrible\" was never really good. Every time I go to them it's because I have friends wanting to go there. If was up to me, I would pass. If have been to the one in Ile-des-Soeurs and Outremont. This one only confirms that there are all the same, average quality food. 

This time, my hamburger was burned (meat overcooked and black). The fries were ok.

Would come back for a drink and the view only with friends visiting from outside Montreal."}
{"text":"Happy to see Les Enfants Terrible on Nuns Island. The salmon tartar was delicious. Service is a little bit slow and the bread never made it to our table. I would definitely sit on the bar next time and experiment with a cocktail ."}
{"text":"You go downtown, take an elevator in the iconic Place Ville-Marie straight to the top (more or less) and step into this much talked about Brasserie. 3 of the 4 walls are the showpiece, which is floor to ceiling glass with a view from the 43rd floor over Montreal. The design is sober, maybe a bit to sober but that's just details. 

Let's be clear that the service from start to finish at \"Les Enfants Terribles\" is top notch and attentive. Even how they take care of children is to be commended. The staff makes you feel important and certainly not intrusive even if you do show up with kids, it is a brasserie after all...

When we get to the food it becomes a little more ambiguous. The food is made from quality product that simply tastes fresh, you eat the food and you say to yourself, this is really good stuff. Where I felt disappointed was with he menu itself. Sur the bacon was delicious, but I can have thinly sliced bacon anywhere. Why not be different and hit me with a really thick slice of hand cut bacon, or hand crafted breakfast sausage. I mean does breakfast potatoes have to be fried? That's a diner workaround to go faster. How's about a hash brown made on the flat grill. The same with the Fish and Chips, the fries and everything else, it was all so cliché and been there done that. I mean by ordering the Sugar Shack breakfast I want to be blown away with something special. If Martin Picard can take Sugar Shack food and push up into the stratosphere of awesomeness, so can Les Enfants Terribles' chef I'm sure. No POW! No ZING! No cranial detonations. It missed some imagination, it missed some finesse, it missed some flair. 

It was like having a canapé of bread and pâté which is delicious in itself but it needed that little dollop of Port jelly to make it go POW! in your mouth. The little details that elevate the simplest of foods.

But that was Brunch. I'll go back at night for the night view and the night menu. But for now, 3 stars, no more."}
{"text":"Great view to enjoy with your brunch. Grilled avocado plate was delicious. Might be a small portion for those accustomed to \"construction breakfasts\" but imo was just the perfect balance for me to enjoy & indulge without feeling heavy afterwards!"}

{"text":"Very surprising and amazing place to eat in a restaurant ! The food is very good but the service could be better."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant before, but went for the first time to the Place Ville-Marie one since it's opening.

I went with a friend at lunch time, it was maybe 1:30 when we got there. The place was packed, but emptied slowly and we had a table right away.

I must say, they are conveniently located, but there is hundreds of people working around that area, so I do understand the others' comments when they say service was slow. We felt a bit underdressed, seeing all the business people wearing suits eating in there, and we were dressed casual (it is a casual-dressing place...), but that must be the effect of place Ville-Marie.

I cannot complain of the service we had, we were in and out within one hour. The couple next to us actually told the waiter they only had 45 minutes and were also served in time.
The view must be very nice from there (old 747 club!) but it was quite rainy on the day I went. 

They ran out of the fish option of the menu du jour. 
The soup was tasty (menu du jour) and our plate (beef ribs that they were called, but it was a piece of beef) was maybe a 3.5/5, but for the view and the service, I decided to up it to a 4/5. 

They serve alcohol and have the Belgian Moon beer too :)"}
{"text":"Le service est un gros zéro du début à la fin. Je ne pouvais pas laisser mon sac au vestiaire car il est réservé uniquement pour un certain groupe. Arrivée à la table du maître d'hôtel, il ne nous salut pas et parle avec un serveuse. Arrivée dehors sur la terrasse il y a une table avec juste une chaise (on était trois). Ensuite au bar mobile, le tenancier sert la fille en arrière de moi; dommage que je n'avais pas de talon haut. On est parti et on a trouver un super resto où les serveurs sont heureux de voir les clients arriver!"}
{"text":"First of all the location is everything, you're eating at the top of Place Ville Marie with a gorgeous view of Montreal. However, nothing noteworthy about the food and it is overpriced for what it is. Keep in mind you're mostly paying for the view."}
{"text":"AMAZING views, food is pretty good, very modern decor.

Place was pretty packed, very cool atmosphere, with a little observation deck you can take pictures out of. The tall glass walls have little slots you can shove your phone in to take pictures of your surroundings.

Had the escargo, pretty rich and good. 

Moscow mule here was really good."}
{"text":"Being my third time here, brunch was my best meal.  
The freshest smoked salmon I've  ever had at any brunch in Montreal, & they are generous with real maple syrup. 

Mostly inexperienced young staff. 
Brought clients here for dinner. 
Had our $90 wine poured by a teen who propped bottle on lip of my glass. Dripped wine down side of my glass, down bottle & all along table. 
Told us to enjoy & walked away!
What happened to training? Standards? 
Les Enfants Terribles... Ça porte bien son nom!

Carpaccio was bland & dry. 
Calamari was good. 
Tartare de saumon just meh. 
Saumon poêlé, over cooked. 
Poulet de Cornouailles rôti was good. 

It's an Outremont staple, well supported by its local patrons, who frequent as a basic locale. As that it's fine, but I wouldn't drive across town for a special dining experience, 'cuz it just ain't all that."}
{"text":"Great location. Service a bit slow, the tables are too close to each other. Food is okay, nothing wow. Probably better for lunch than supper"}
{"text":"This was an easy place to give a 5 star. 

Starting with the décor, simple with a nice black and white theme. It really paired well with the modern look of the restaurant. 

The staff was pretty good and was able to deal with a small crowd well. We got our food in a quick and efficient manner (although we did have to ask our waiter for the free bread). 
The food (mac and cheese and spaghetti carbonara) was delicious. The spaghetti carbonara  had the egg yolk on top which I then mixed in myself, which I thought was a cool unique spin on the meal. The meals were both visually appetizing and tasteful. 

The restaurant was surprisingly affordable too. We paid about 110 but keep in mind we ordered 4 drinks total, which added to almost half the bill, which is what you would expect when ordering drinks in most larger cities.
 
The drinks were also pretty good. Definitely strong, they didn't hold back on the booze, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone goes for the views, which are without a doubt incomparable, but the food really brings it to the next level to give it the fifth star. Will be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Average food, but worth a visit to close our first trip to Montreal for the views alone!"}
{"text":"Ça doit être le plus haut restaurant de Montréal, au sommet de Place Ville-Marie, en plein centre-ville. 

On a pris une table sur le bord de fenêtre. Super belle vue sur Montréal. Le brunch était correct, rien de très spécial. Service amical. Le prix est un peu cher, mais noter que tu peux aller sur le terrase situé au même étage, à la place de payer 20$ pour l'observatoire... je trouve que ça vaut vraiment la peine et je le recommande à ceux qui visitent Montréal :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. The view was stunning, and I was honestly expecting much higher prices for the ambience alone not to mention the food. Very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times now and I'm likely to come back again since I work in the same building. The view and the beautiful interior is reason enough to visit this place. But to be perfectly honest the dishes I've tried on the menu were OK at best. If the food had more of a wow factor I'd definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"Sadly this one keeps on disapointing me. I will say their brunches are OK, but the lunch/dinner menu is an absolute no go. Akward combinations, decieving executions and overpriced all the way. Which is too bad, since the decor is lovely and the staff is always very kind."}
{"text":"Very nice looking bar and restaurant but that's where it ends. Bartender/ waitress doesn't speak English. We ordered Ceasar salad, bulgar side dish and Pate chinois. Nothing had flavor we even asked for extra sauce for salad which tasted like plain yogurt. No spices, no flavor and food was warm. Also staff sitting at bar to eat and we're on their cells which I understand everyone deserves a break but they could of just gave them a table in corner since it was end of night."}
{"text":"I tried this resto for lunch with a few coworkers and I have mixed feelings about it. We showed up a little early to make sure we could get a table so there was no issue there. The inside is very comfortable and cozy but still modern and clean. Our server while very friendly did not check on us very often (our water wasn't really refilled) and we had to wait a long time to ask for and receive things like Tabasco sauce or ketchup etc ... it also took a really long time to receive our food (even though we were there early enough to put in our orders and beat the crowd) and then took even longer to get our waiters attention for the bills and then again for him to bring them to us and get them paid. However , the food itself got mixed reviews around the table . I had a braised beef shepherds pie which was very good and decent portion. But others weren't as happy with their food , 1 person ordered a fish sandwich and thought it was not bad and another person got Mac and cheese and said it lacked flavour. The portion sizes were alright but overall a bit overpriced. Perhaps we had some bad luck on the day we went , I am not opposed to going back again to give it another chance though."}
{"text":"If you want the chance to experience a meal with a view then Les Enfants Terribles is the place to come. The restaurant is located on the 44th floor of Place Ville Marie in what used to be the 737 night club and you can expect 360 views of the city.  There is an express elevator from the lobby that gets you to the 42nd floor and from there you take a second one to get to the 44th floor.  There is also a terrasse for the warmer months.  

I had seen the other Yelp reviews about the service so I was apprehensive about that but for the most part the service was pretty good despite the fact that the restaurant was packed for the lunch rush.  The service may have been a bit on the slow side at certain points during the meal but it wasn't as bad as others have described.  As a side note if you intend to come at lunch be sure to reserve because the restaurant is full then with the office crowd.  

Now let's talk food.  I was starving so I went for a soup and one of their daily specials as part of the table d'hote.  On this particular day the soup was a cream of spinach soup which would have been good had it not been so salty.  That was followed by a shrimp and arugula salad with yoghourt dressing and you know how that turned out?  More salt!  It's a real shame because in both cases it overpowered the other flavours of the dish and if they just used less they probably would have been more enjoyable.  You can always add salt after the fact if need be but once you've added too much during the preparation of the dish there is no going back.

When talking about the price the restaurant is a little too expensive for my liking.  I get that they have prime real estate but if you're going to be charging high prices the food better be good.  $21 for a salad is excessive in my opinion.  Sure there were shrimp in it but considering that it was pretty average it just wasn't worth the money.

The view here is excellent but at the end of the day that alone is not enough for a restaurant.  Good food also factors into the equation and I find that here the experience is pretty average.  I would possibly come back for a quick drink and maybe some appetizers but I doubt I would return for a full meal."}
{"text":"Vendredi midi au sommet de la Place Ville-Marie. Bondé! Le service s'en ressent. Nous avons opté pour la table d'hôte.  Un pavé de mahi mahi à la cuisson parfaite. Accompagnements sans grand intérêt,  presqu'inexistants. Le burger était sec, du pain à la viande. Pourquoi diable la viande des hamburgers doit elle être archicuite?! Non, si la viande est fraîche, pas de soucis pour le e-coli, si c'est votre préoccupation. Les frites d'accompagnement étaient quelconques. Des juliennes froides. Une mayonnaise (très) classique. Les desserts semblaient bons (pouding chômeur et gâteau au fromage). La vue imprenable sur la ville vaut le coup pour les romantiques. À condition d'avoir une place près de la fenêtre."}
{"text":"Located on the 44th floor in Place Ville Marie downtown, this bistro restaurant gives you a stunning view of the city. 

We came for a drink before heading to dinner. Since we were 3, we couldn't make a reservation because they only take reservation for groups of 6+. It was packed and we had to wait over an hour before having a table. For those who don't mind sitting at the bar, it goes faster and they have more room.

We started with a bottle of red wine and sparkling water. As appetizer, we got a plate of charcuterie consisting of 2 types of meat served with bread and pickles, and a plate of fried calamari served with a spicy mayo. The food is average so I will say, don't expect to get the best food in the city here. 

While the waitress poured us the sparkling water, I saw an eyelash over the lemon slice on my glass. I told her and she immediately went to change my glass, gave us a new bottle of sparkling water and didn't charge us for the first one either. All the staff was very attentive and friendly. The service was excellent from the beginning to the end. 

I've never come for brunch or dinner so I won't be able to tell you much about the main dishes but I will definitely recommend this place for a drink and appetizer while enjoying the beautiful sunset falling in the city."}
{"text":"J'ai été aux Enfants Terribles peu après l'ouverture au Sommet de la Place Ville Marie. Je ne pense pas y retourner bientôt mais je crois que c'est à essayer quand on est à Montréal. Même si le décor extérieur laisse un peu à désirer (la terrasse n'est pas terminée), c'est agréable de prendre un verre et de manger avec une telle vue sur la ville. La nourriture était bonne, quoique légèrement chère pour ce que c'était. Le service est OK. Pensez à réserver à l'avance (au moins une semaine si vous prévoyez venir un soir de fin de semaine)."}
{"text":"Worst food ever ! I made me wanna throw up ! I ordered the omelette charcuterie it had no taste and tasted so much like eggs only no seasoning . The salad is only lettuce . No creativity. Worst food ever but the service is good and the view is nice . My sister took the jardiniers omelette it was disgusting"}
{"text":"I was last here August of last year just to enjoy the view and have a drink. I was honestly scared to come back and try the food because of all the bad reviews online. My aunt wanted to come because she never went to this location having been to the one on Bernard a few times. She wanted to see the view and she wanted to take me here for my birthday so we went Wednesday after work with low expectations. 

We got a good seat next to the window. I recommend that you request a seat close to the glass when you reserve so that you can admire the view. The view is the #1 selling factor! I ordered the Bloody d'ici cocktail. It's basically a bloody Caesar in a small glass. It was thick and contained gin, vodka and rum but surprisingly didn't taste as strong as one would expect. My aunt ordered a glass of chardonnay and we shared the fried calamari entrée. 
The fried calamari was just ok. I've had way better elsewhere. It was a bit on the chewy side but still a step up from the fried calamari I had the night before at le Blumenthal. 
We took our time and I had more drinks and they did not rush us to order which I liked. I ordered an Aperol Spritz which had a bit more Aperol than I normally put when I make it but that's ok because I don't mind the bitter taste of Aperol. Then I ordered a glass of red wine to go with my beef tartare main.

The beef tartare was surprisingly good! It was a good size and came with croutons. It had a layer of parmesan on it which I really enjoyed! For sides there was a choice of salad or fries and the waiter allowed me to have both which I greatly appreciated. The fries were pretty good! They were crispy and salty. The salad was simple... mainly just greens with radishes which I removed because I don't like radishes. My aunt ordered the Cornish hen. The plate was huge! I tried a piece and it was fine. It wasn't wow but nothing beats the Cornish Hen like the one at Bar George. 

We were both full and did not order dessert. 

I would recommend this restaurant because the view is just amazing and the view alone makes it worth coming here! And you know what, the food is really not that bad! It's really A-Ok. Just don't come with high expectations. The décor is nice and I think its romantic enough for a date. I particularly liked the candelabra on the tables. The only thing I found weird was that the chairs were kind of low for the table."}
{"text":"I have no comments about the place itself, the view is beautiful, the interior is well decorated and the food is quite good. HOWEVER, i made a booking for a group of 12 on a Friday, it was for a baby shower and i bought some decor (balloons and some napkins). When calling to make the booking i made sure to include that i will be bringing a small cake, they notified me about the \"cutting fee which is 3$ per person\" I thought this was quite ridiculous but whatever i went with the flow. Upon arriving, we ordered some mousseux and appetizers and proceeded to the food.  
As for the cake part, i went with cupcakes that i distributed myself at the end of the meal and in hopes to avoid the \"cake cutting fee\"
Which did not happen.
I was still charged 36$ FEE. 
The service is great and the food was good but I think since our table made over 300-400$ in bills that \"cutting cake fee\" could've been avoided since we technically DID NOT USE IT.
Anyways, they should review that but otherwise it was all O.K."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to hangout with friends and your loved one.

I came to this restaurant with my colleagues for out 5 to 7 to have a great time. 

And then, I came here for a date. Very good for the view and environment.

Couple thing to know before come to the top.

If you are here only for a drink, you cannot have the outside table. Also they are not available for reservation. You have to eat to stay outside.

Very nice view.

Food average."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner Saturday night, sat outside, made the reservation 2 hours before, sat outside, it was a beautiful evening in May, the setting is on the water, but in a very private quiet part of Nuns Island, parking is not a problem.  The service is very good and the prices are reasonable.  We started with a large dish of beets and goat cheese salad for the 4 of us recommended by the waiter and our main course was either a swordfish or salmon steak,  they were both very well prepared and delicious.  We finished with coffee and a chocolate mousse that we all shared.

I highly recommend this restaurant for either a quiet relaxed romantic evening or a louder trendy, active experience (depending where you want to sit)"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because everyone talks about it being so good.  I ordered their shepherds pie and wasn't impressed.   People rave about this place being so delicious , I found it to be pretty overrated for what it is. Not a restaurant I would go to again."}
{"text":"Pros: 
La vue est super on voit toute la ville en hauteur et l'ambiance pour un mercredi soir est pétillante, c'est plein de monde. 

Les drinks ne déçoivent  pas. Le moscow mule est servi dans un verre en aluminium qui garde la température froide et le petit goût piquant fait la différence. 

Le saumon est bon le quinoa par contre est sec. 


Cons: 
Notre serveuse avait une mauvaise attitude. J'ai invité de la famille et mes parents ne voulaient pas manger, ils ne sortent pas souvent et je voulais leur faire plaisir. La serveuse leur a dit de façon malpolie qu'il fallait manger pour boire et quand ils ont commandé des frites et une salade seulement, son visage a laissé transparaître du dégoût. Cela m'a mis mal à l'aise.pour le saumon j'ai demandé au bus boy du citron et quand jai fini de manger , la serveuse est revenue demander s'il manquait quelque chose... un peu trop tard! Elle a pris une photo de nous au moins. 

Je n'allais pas lui donner de tip car je déteste qu'on manque de respect à ma famille mais finalement je lui ai donné un 10$cash sur un facture de120$ pour être polie, et elle n'a même pas dit merci!!! Je n'aurais rien dû donner! Belle effrontée!!! Éduquez vos serveuses sur le service à la clientèle !!!!

Venez pour la vue et les drinks"}
{"text":"Good location and tasty food. A bit over priced but you're paying for the view. Overall a very nice experience I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from the stash the chef and everyone else here after reading the reviews, it's just a basic restaurant no big bells or whistles nothing so fancy."}
{"text":"J'étais déjà fan des Enfants Terribles dans Outremont, mais là du haut du 44ème étage, c'est encore plus merveilleux. Les mêmes prix et les mêmes menus mais avec une vue sublime sur Montréal."}
{"text":"Food = 3 stars
View = 4 stars

For tourists, this restaurant is a fun way to see the city on a beautiful sunny day. For locals, it's a great place to take your out-of-town friends who do not have a picky palate. No matter what, don't order poutine, because it is not real Quebecois poutine. The eggs benny were  so-so in taste. The table next to ours had ordered a grilled avocado that actually looked very appetizing, but I can't  comment on the taste. 

If I were to come again with out-of-town friends, I would stop by for a drink, get a few pictures and move on to other touristy locations/better food options."}
{"text":"I work in Outremont and this is pretty much my favourite lunch place in the hood. The food is consistently great and the service is impeccable...plus they have an absolutely kick ass patio in the summer, most perfect for people watching. The specials of the day are always so varied and they have something for absolutely everyone.

Their fish and chips, mac & cheese, fish special and desserts are all to die for and the atmosphere is always fun, not too loud and they are somehow always able to accommodate even a larger table of people: magic! I agree with Ms V in that they are somehow able to blend all sorts of people, from all age groups and walks of life into one fun meld. You won't regret eating at Les Enfants!"}
{"text":"Came here for a wine event 2 weeks ago and was absolutely blown away by the view, absolutely gorgeous. Lovely looking restaurant with great service, but I have to say that the food at the Bernard location is better; everything was tasty but definitely overpriced for what it was and the service was quite slow. That said, every carnivore in my group said that the beef tartare was quite tasty, so there's that!

I'd come back for a spiffy glass of wine after work to impress clients with the view and the ambiance, but I wouldn't be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"This place is accurately \"terrible\" - all hype no substance. May be cool for tourists to get a nice view of the city, but not worth staying to eat or nor go to the washroom, as the motion censors may turn-off on you; leaving you pooping alone in the dark."}
{"text":"We were in Montréal for a couple of days with some family. After reading reviews and the menu prior to getting into town, my husband and I had originally decided not to try this restaurant. The menu was not his thing, nor my brother's... both are gastronomically challenged, i.e. no frou frou twists with their meat and potatoes. As we were walking around the shops at Place Ville Marie, my husband made an executive decision. This was our 15-year old niece's first visit to Montréal and he wanted her to experience dining at the highest restaurant in the city with the most spectacular view. That did not disappoint! This really is more of a three star adventure, but we had good, attentive service overall and the view makes everything that much better, earning that fourth star. 

It was mid-afternoon on a Friday, so not too busy and didn't have to wait for a table. However we were five and the hostess put us at a table of four, meaning one person had to sit at the end, abutting into the table behind us. And the new/old 60s style plastic chairs with metal slider bases did exactly that on the concrete floor. Guess she noticed we were struggling a bit and came back to ask if we would like a bigger table. Yes, please. New table for six was a big improvement, with wooden chairs. And right at the front looking out to the rooftop terrace. Bit cool and breezy so only a couple people out there. 

We had a choice of sparkling or still water to start. Still tasted like tap water poured into an old wine bottle, but sparkling came from a fresh bottle. My sister-in-law wanted some red wine. They don't have merlot, but the waitress asked what she likes and then made a recommendation. Apparently it was quite acceptable, because she had two glasses. The guys had their beloved Cokes, but I tried one of the mocktails: jus de vie. It was very refreshing. Came in a big bowled glass which actually needed two hands to hold. Felt like a kid not able to hold their sippy cup safely. LOL

We opted to get the homemade charcuteries to start. Usually my husband loves smoked meat, but this did nothing for him, not even salami which he is partial to. Ended up that us three ladies polished it off. The pickled veg (cauliflower, beans, onion slices) were best part. For entrées... my brother found a simple burger and fries so he was happy. Hubby had the 8oz flank steak and seemed quite satisfied. The girls both had the seared salmon on red quinoa. Gee, it looked good. Wished I had chosen it too but the menu said there was grapefruit, which I can't have because of medication. When I saw it was just used as garnish, I kicked myself. I ordered what was supposed to be rosemary and lemon Cornish hen with chanterelles and baby potatoes. Pity my hen was missing the herbs and ended up being a plain old mini roast chicken. I missed when our new waitress came by to check on us (think there was a shift change) or I would have said something. It was fine, just not what I had expected. Was it a language issue when I ordered, and said I'll have the Cornish hen, did she think I didn't want the rosemary and lemon? I should have been specific. It took a very long time for our meals to come out. I'm guessing the hen slowed things down. No room or time for dessert. We had a date to keep with Adele... :)"}
{"text":"Good twists on french Canadian meals like the pate chinois. Great tartar as well. Nice location in the heart of Outremont. Weekend brunches are very busy...be ready to wait in line. A Montreal classic! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to outermont, but it's such a lovely lively neighbourhood.. The place is nice and trendy.. the food was great, good selection of French/soul food.. The braised beef with creamed corn and pureed potatoes was to die for!! The aloe mojito was a fantastic mocktial.. The place was a bit LOUD for pleasant conversation, my friends and I kept yelling over the music and the noise to hear each other, but other than that, it was a lovely experience.."}
{"text":"Lunch de semaine. Menu brasserie. Les plats sont corrects, mais la finition laisse à désirer. Beurre aromatisé gelé sur la bavette? Accompagnements minimalistes voire absents? Pourquoi il faut demander le sel, le lait pour le café, pourquoi le cube de beurre avec le pain est gelé aussi?

Le service a été correct dans l'attitude mais vraiment lent. Pour un lunch d'affaires, c'est problématique.

Sélection limitée de vin au verre, un peu chers d'autant plus que les volumes offerts m'ont semblé chiches.

Somme toute correct d'autant plus que les options à l'Ile des Soeurs ne sont pas si nombreuses..."}
{"text":"Fortait yoga brunch , original mais attendez vous à un menu modeste pour le deal de yoga-brunch... mais la belle vue sur Montreal compense n'importe quel manque ;)"}
{"text":"The service was great, I had the seared salmon and my friend had the ribs, everything was perfectly cooked. The service was lovely so was the view. Will come back"}
{"text":"Good food but small portions. I was still hungry after my meal. I got the Grilled Half Avocado but replaced the salmon with another poached egg. 
My hubby got the Jardinere Omelette. And we shared the Beet with warm Goat Cheese salad. 
All were very flavorful but unfortunately pretty small. I also had to drink the Fresh juice with all the fruits and carrot mixed together. It was also small. And Hubby got the latte with soy milk and he really liked it.
They left a bottle of water on the table. 
Service was good."}
{"text":"I would say enjoyable experience, good food, good scenery.  Staff was a bit slow but not bothersome.  Grilled octopus was tender and delicious, my shrimp salad was incredibly fresh.  Great wine selection, decent cocktails.  Will be back when I am back in the area!"}
