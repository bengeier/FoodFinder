{"text":"I've ordered from this place so many times before & the food is ALWAYS excellent. You get so much food for a very reasonable price. I always order the fried chicken with rice & a large runs me about $12. The price is about the same for the jerk chicken. The only con about this place is that they run out of food fast because of how good the food really is."}
{"text":"Best jerk in Toronto! I've tried quite a few of the places in the GTA that are said to have the best jerk and Bucky's stands out. Their coleslaw is great. The jerk itself is a good level of spicy and not overly salty. The chicken itself has never been dry. Definitely worth the trek!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the $5 lunch special. I usually add a dumpling or two to make up for the portion size for the special. Great food none the less."}
{"text":"I am Jamaican.  I've had jerk in Jamaica and I make it myself.  This place has some of the best jerk chicken and jerk pork I've ever tasted!!  The best thing about their chicken is that it is moist.  Some other jerk places in the area serve very dry chicken, or they serve a sort of \"jerk\" that's actually just stew chicken.  If you are looking for an authentic jerk pork or chicken, eat here!

The oxtail and curry goat is fairly good as well."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best Jamaican restaurants in the gta! I was greeted by a pleasant female server with a smile. No long wait time, free WiFi,  tasteful and edible food well pleasing to the eye and stomach.

Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"This place was so expensive for 1 large jerk chicken dinner and a large BBQ chicken dinner and 3 pops over 28.00 plus the chicken was so dry and looks like it was old and the rice so little lol!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Jerk pork meal. The rice was ok, nothing special, kind of dry. The jerk pork was a bit dry, but quite smokey which I enjoyed. Also, I found it not to have a complex flavour like most other Jamaican places. They have an extremely hot sauce, which is always nice, but be careful, it might hurt later. The decor itself is similar to other Carribean places. Food is good, prices are ok. They have a lot of specials going, so some of them might hit the spot more than your wallet."}
{"text":"Wow new fav place to eat in Brampton. This is some amazing jerk chicken. I had half jerk half fried. I wanted to try both. Fried chicken was good but not amazing so next time probably just get the jerk chicken.  I was good the coleslaw was amazing and same with rice. 

Will return. 100%"}
{"text":"Came back last night. Fried chicken was even less fresh than the last time and I don't even think they have a great recipe. Jerk chicken is still pretty good, but nothing that separates it from the pack.
This place is still okay, but I don't think I'd readily endorse it either."}
{"text":"Awesome! Best jerk ever!  In fact, this is probably the best quick lunch spot I've been to in many, many years. This place is super good.  It's mostly a take-away business but either way, you can't go wrong.

Thanks Yelp, for suggesting this place!  Never would have noticed it otherwise."}
{"text":"I love Jamaican food. My first true discovery of this casual and cool food was from Pearl who would cook up plantain and beans and rice and ackee and saltfish for breakfast.  One of my favourite ways of having breakfast.

Really solid food for Jamaican and I think the best was the Ox Tail.
ya gotta try it.

My collegue's really enjoyed it and especially since it was their first time having Jamaican food, I was sooooo happy they likey!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite restaurant. I just had the jerk chicken, rice and coleslaw (very small portion of coleslaw though) and they're all delicious and full of flavour! It might be too peppery for some but I'd say it's worth the burn."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. I ordered jerk chicken and it was delicious. The spicing was great, although was a tiny bit salty, but it won't stop me going back again."}
{"text":"Betta Jerk is hidden in a secluded corner of a retail parking lot behind a Burger King. There's quite a few food options in this plaza, but they're mostly all chain restaurants (ex. Mr Greek, Extreme Pita).

Upon walking in, you'll see that the restaurant is closed-concept. High walls form a barrier between the dine-in and takeout area, and not much naturla light makes it into the restaurant. The walls lead you to directly to the takeout counter, where you'll often find a group of people standing around, either waiting to order or waiting for their order.

The scene described above is my major gripe with Betta Jerk - the waiting. If you go during the lunch rush, you can expect to spend most of your lunch break just waiting for your order to be made. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend Betta Jerk as a suitable lunch option unless you're willing to beat the traffic and order ahead of the rush. Even a handful of people ahead of you can take a while.

The food, though? It's pretty good. Nothing special, but worth the reasonable prices. It doesn't help that one of the GTA's best jerk restaurants (Portland Jerk) is right across the street, but in a vacuum, they make decently good jerk cuisine."}
{"text":"I placed my order through skip the dishes. I got the jerk chicken lunch special that comes with 1 and a half pieces of chicken. After taxes it came to 6 dollars and change.

My order was ready when I got there. The chicken was tender and had just the right amount of spice. The only complaint I have is that the chicken had a weird after taste."}
{"text":"We decided to try the jerk pork, jerk chicken and fried chicken. The jerk pork and chicken were incredibly spicy, but delicious. The fried chicken was amazing, oil was minimal. 

Jerk pork with rice and peas with coleslaw - $4.99 (lunch special)
Fried Chicken with rice and coleslaw - $4.99 (lunch special)
Jerk pork (large) - $12.00
Busta Pop (Grape, kola champagne and cream soda)

Overall it needed more seasoning and less pepper to really bring out the flavours of the meat, the spiciness was overwhelming."}
{"text":"Becky's Betta Jerk Chicken is one of the better or betta places I have gone. Their $5 lunch special make it a great place for a quick lunch. They also know how to add heat to a meal, so if you want to be adventurous here watch out. The heat increases really quickly. The staff is always friend, but the service can be slow from time to time. Still, the food makes up for the slow service."}
{"text":"I would give 5 star but the cashier have no customer service the one with the glasses and the 2 braids ,why are u guys hiring people like this order my soup no hello no smile bring my soup put it on the counter and walk off in the kitchen I will not be returning plus u don't know who ur serving have customer service people"}
{"text":"Recently moved to a job in Brampton and wanted to check out the local fare.
Top of my list of favourite foods is Jamaican or West Indian food. I love it.

After looking up local joints, I stopped into Bucky's Betta Jerk (before it dropped the Bucky's).
The restaurant had a few customers already seated and eating, and no one else in line other than me. The service was lacklustre and a bit aloof. I waited quite a while for my take out order, at least 15 minutes. I was pleased when the owner came around to light a fire under the kitchen to get my order out. 

Food was average in flavour and portion. I can get better jerk chicken elsewhere."}
{"text":"Totally tried this place because it was next to a nail shop that my wife was getting a manicure at. I had no idea what I was in store for, but I thought, what the hell, I'm in Ontario - I'm having jerk chicken. Thank god it was good!

First off, this place is a hole in the wall, well maintained take-out type of place. It isn't a fancy joint and their menu is very basic. I like it, it's a no non-sense approach. Second, they are quick. I had the lunch special jerk chicken - which was about $6-7 with tax. It comes with some salad, rice and two pieces of well marinated chicken. It hit the spot. The staff was courteous and I left pleased. I betta try some more dishes when I return."}
{"text":"Very good Jerk Chicken! 

It was the first time I tried this place and I will definitely go back and forget the other jerk places around. 

The rice and peas taste good and in the large order you get enough for two times!
The Chicken is excellent with a very good amount of jerk seasoning, not just a little stuff on top, there was a layer and not too spicy (I would of liked it more spicy). 

The price for a large size Chicken jerk is $11 which might seem higher then other places, you would be right, HOWEVER the amount of chicken and rice and peas is more than any other place I've gone to. 

They have take out and enough chairs for quite a few people to sit down and enjoy the good food. 

Friendly staff that actually want to talk to you and enjoy it. Great Service. 

If you like Jerk them try this place."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is really good! The Jerk chicken is Amazing and the rice and peas is simple! The cole slaw isn't anything to remember but it isn't bad. Everytime I go to a Jamaican restaurant, the service is either decent or bad.. The lady was polite and seemed very happy, which I like. The carrot juice was really good and I also got a cream soda to go. This is my new Jamaican spot every time I am in the area. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I eat from here pretty much every week. Everytime I go I order the Curry goat! The food is always on point. The service is great and fast. Their prices are reasonable. Best Jamaican resturant in Brampton hands down."}
{"text":"I was out and about and wanted to satisfy my craving for Jerk Chicken. I looked up the map in my trusty yelp app and spotted Betta Jerk closest to me. Drove there, parked and walked in, not a fancy place, actually difficult to see due to the color of the sign, there were tables available to dine in, walked up to the counter, reviewed my options and spotted the Jerk Chicken lunch special. 

The special came in a burger sized container, it had a small chicken drum  and quarter, served on a bed of rice with beans as well as a small dab of coleslaw. The chicken looked good (dark spices coated the skin) was well cooked and had a dryer texture but was extremely tender and fell of the bone. Flavor was very good and had a hint of spice. The rice was also very good, well cooked and the spice level in mine was amped to a 9/10! where as the person I was with had a much lower level of spice 5/10. I guess I depends where they scooped it from. I'm not a big fan of slaw so I won't comment either way, and in any case, there was not enough to make a reasonable assumption.

Overall Betta Jerk hit the spot for me and their lunch special is definitely worth a look and taste. I will be back and looking forward to trying their other specials and meals."}
