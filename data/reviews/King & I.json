{"text":"The service wasn't amazing, and the food was only ok. The atmosphere was fine. If the food was amazing then less then friendly wait staff wouldn't be such a big deal, but the mediocre food doesn't justify the trip."}
{"text":"King & I is my go to spot whenever I'm in the mood for panang curry. I really need to try more dishes on their menu. I've pretty much stuck to the curry and pad thai. Looking forward to cold weather so I can try their soups. Have called in orders for pick-up (always friendly) and placed delivery orders online. Have never had a problem with the food. It's always fresh and hot! Love King & I"}
{"text":"We came here after Pin Kaow had a 20 minute wait.  I'm sure glad we did.  I would say the King and I has been around for a very long time.  It's tucked away in what is considered \"The Lakes\" area of Las Vegas near Sahara and Durango.  I'm a loyal Yelper and count on my fellow Yelpers when I decide to go somewhere to eat.  I came here about 5 years ago and decided to return based on the Yelp reviews.  This place was legit.  My \"picky\" family loved it.  There were not a lot people around so the service was great as you would expect when no one else is around.  At the beginning the server was very direct, but as the night went on, the server and staffed warmed up to us. I appreciated that.  We ate at around 8:30 P.M. and I was concerned the food would not come out fresh.  I was wrong.  It was fresh and great tasting.  They also offer some Chinese dishes in addition to Thai food.  If you're a big fan of Thai BBQ Ribs, they do offer it here as an appetizer, not an entree, but even as an appetizer, they give you 4 good sized ribs with a fair amount of meat on them.  They were good.  I had the fried rice combination plate which adds Chicken, Pork, Shrimp and Beef.  It was really good.  It wasn't spicy but I didn't ask for it.    We also had mixed vegetables with Chicken, Beef Peppered steak and Won Ton Soup as an appetizer.  All great.  Family had the steamed white rice and it was moist and fresh.  I want to try their traditional Thai dishes next time and I'm not usually that adventurous but I'm confident based on my experience that it will be good here.   I will definitely return to The King and I."}
{"text":"This place is TO. DIE. FOR.  If your looking for authentic light Thai cuisine, this the place for you. The owner was so nice and have us personal attention.  I would fly back the Vegas especially for his food.  Extra-special-deliciousness!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good and the value is outstanding.  My recommendation: I ordered the Bangkok Connection which featured shrimp, scallops, chicken and pork mixed with carrot, bok choi, pea pods, and several other vegetables in a light pepper sauce that was not too spicy.  With the amount of shrimp and scallops in the dish, I don't see how they can serve it at $14.95.  This is an incredible value!  And even better, the dish was cooked perfectly.  The most impressive thing was that the scallops had obviously been cooked seperately because they were perfect: cooked through and warm but not rubbery (which happens with scallups if cooked even a minute too long).  There were a couple of minor issues.  First, when we got our left overs, the server wiped the spoon of sticky rice with her finger to get the last kernels into the box.  Also, atmosphere is slightly off for dining in.  It is small and cramped and the Neon signs are the main source of lighting.  It is on the Lake but you can't actually see the lake.  And on the trivial side, food does not come fast and there is a language barrier.    So great value and delicious food gives them my very enthusiast 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had never tried  curry before and was about to get orange chicken and play it safe. I am SO glad my husband talked me into trying the yellow curry! It was delicious and I am now a super fan. We order from here once or twice a month since we live around the corner. It is nice that we can easily order online and it is here within 20-30 min! Even my toddler can't get enough Pad Thai. The eggrolls are so crispy and delicious and I love that when I order the lunch specials for take-out, they come with a side of fruit for my baby! I mean good fruit too! kiwis, strawberries, apples and grapes :] We have yet to encounter a problem with this place."}
{"text":"We got here at 9:40pm which was not a problem. The owner who is very friendly even let people in after 10pm.   The food was really good. Loved the Tom yum soup and the beef salad. The pad Thai was pretty good too.  I definitely recommend this place. Had a great experience overall."}
{"text":"I'm not to impressed with the food. We ordered take out. We ordered crab ragoon it was fine can't complain. Ordered combo fried rice it was very good I think the only thing we ordered that was good we ordered pepper steak I asked for no onion and red bell pepper but said green bell only. We got no peppers and it just tastes bland same with the Kung pow combo. No flavor it tasted like TV dinner Salisbury steak. I think maybe if the peppers were in it could have had more flavor but I'm pretty sure we won't order from here again."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of Thai food in town and our friends said they loved this place. Tried it out and thought everything was really good. I LOVED the coconut ice cream.The service was great too! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I gave them a star simply for the speed of delivery and their so so chicken satay. The rest of the food tasted odd. I had the garlic \"pepper\" beef, (there was nothing peppery about it), and the combo fried rice. Both tasted off, nothing what I was expecting. I guess I can't expect a Thai restaurant to make Chinese food well, but then why have it on your menu???? To top it off, the rest of the reviews were correct. I spent my night hunched over my toilet puking out what little I had consumed! Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to the one on Windmill (really small place) and I've gotten food delivered from the Tropicana location. Bad service from both and the food was okay. Nothing special not really worth going to.  You can probably find better food elsewhere for the same price."}
{"text":"Great food and they deliver! Big plus! The restaurant is small and sometimes they leave a tv on in the back which is distracting so we prefer to order out."}
{"text":"Such a good restaurant for my first time being there!! I am so glad that my friend recommended this place! The customer service was the ABSOLUTE best and the food was great. My sister and I got the Mixed Veggie dish with tofu and my friend got rice noodles with shrimp, beef, and pork! I also enjoyed the atmosphere. P.S. They give 10 % discounts to students, which was a wonderful surprise!"}
{"text":"Been here last night it's a small decent restaurant beside the lake beautifully decorated. The soup is house special. Their yellow curry is yummy.. fried rice was ok. Spicy chicken we had ordered 3/4 but it wasn't spicy at all compared to other Thai food we ate. Service was excellent for food 4 star added 1 for the service"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I get takeout from this place almost every week...sometimes twice a week when I'm really in a Thai mood! This place is semi-hole in the wall-ish, but the food is pretty good. The owner knows me now because I'm always getting takeout, and usually getting the same thing.   My favorites on the menu are the Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce, Panang Curry, and the Chicken Pad See Ew (rice noodles, with broccoli and some type of sauce). Takeout is usually the best option, they say the food will be ready in 10 minutes...but it's more like 5! I've gotten delivery a couple times, but that takes longer...and since it's pretty much down the street from me, I'll usually just make the drive to get the food.  If you want quick, cheap, but decent Thai food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Dark location. Nice servers who smile! Come here quite a bit. Pad Kee Mao is spicy and amazing!!! Get dat! Yea!  Good ambiance here, not the BEST Thai food but GOOD Thai food if in the area for sure !!"}
{"text":"All the curries are rich in taste and the pad Thai is the closest thing to my favorite one in the Bay Area!  This is my go to Thai joint in LV."}
{"text":"Since I am a Thai junkie now...this place rocks for their Tum Yum Soup (shrimp) in pot with a cool flame, served with side of white rice! This is a small lil hole in the wall by the lake. Their Pad Thai isGREAT...Thai tea to perfection..and I really need to mention their eggrolls to die for...with a small plus they are garnished them with a veggie shaped into a flower! Nice place to have a relaxing intimate lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This review is on their pad thai.  My friend had told me that they had good pad thai. So we went and I ordered the chicken pad thai. And when it came...SUPER DISAPPOINTMENT! The portion is good but the taste is just awful! They used too much vinegar or something for the pad thai that made it have a sour vinegar taste to it. GROSS. Service was okay. They constantly stopped by our table refilling our water.  All in all I've had MUCH BETTER else where! I don't know about the other items on their menu but for their pad thai it's a no. I will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"I found King and I on my Hilton Honors Dining list of best places to eat. And the reviews are accurate. The crispy duck was delicious...heck...EVERYTHING was delicious! This is my new go to Thai spot. Hands down the best I have had in 7 years living in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have only tried a curry dish and definitely plan to go back in and try more on the menu, red curry with tofu was so hearty and savory. I really liked the look of inside the restaurant! The decor was nice and it looked clean! The manager told me about how they have a partner in LA that makes the hot sauce, and his enthusiasm really made a difference."}
{"text":"I had the combination fried rice with level 1 spicy and it was really good.  The soup that came with it was good too.  Staff was friendly and I liked the ambiance."}
{"text":"A cool place with a warm atmosphere. The attractive staff is extremely friendly in an accommodating, professional manner, which made me feel quite welcome. More like a guest than a customer. I've ordered a couple of dishes, Chow Mein and Mongolian Beef that I had them turn up the temperature to a 5, which were terrific, and I just can't miss the Beef Salad and the Chicken Satay. I always order more than I can eat because I like the food so much. They also have a fantastic wine selection--it seems the owner has quite an affection for wine--I ordered what turned out to be an excellent Merlot, especially for the price. If you're over by UNLV and want so great Thai or Chinese Food (I mix and match), give this place a try."}
{"text":"A cozy little niche nestled by the Lakes, be prepared for great aroma's and even better cuisine. The service was excellent and prompt as I even named my vegetables in a delicious Basil Chicken that was spicy and delectable. It was the first time I'd tried some of the side sauces in a Thai Restaurant and I couldn't believe how much I liked them. Flavors that I hadn't experienced delighted my taste buds, in fact, I think I used about four times my quota of one of the red sauces. The proprietors have an attentive and friendly demeanor, as they seemed to have quite an acquainted relationship with several of the other patrons. I tried a nice glass of Chardonnay, and then switched to beer, both of which were a great temperature. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I ordered the Thai beef jerky. It was super tough and looked nothing like it should. Totally over priced for garbage. Never again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from king & I a couple times now.. All has gone well, up until tonight.   A friend and I are having an anti-valentines dinner.. Or so we thought. Placed an order on eat24 at 8pm. Their delivery estimate says 45-60 mins. We realized it was vday, so realistically it would probably take an hour. Both times I had ordered before, it had been half an hour and they had called to let me know they were at the gate.   When I hadn't heard anything at 9pm, I followed up with eat 24. Said they spoke with the restaurant and the driver was on his way. Great. No biggie. When no one was here at 9:25, I decided to just call the restaurant myself. Their phone was either off the hook, or they were deliberately ignoring calls. If it weren't for eat24, I would still have been charged for my food. Luckily they gave us a full refund.   If you're too busy to keep up with your orders, then fine. At least call your customer to apologize and explain that you wouldn't be able to make it. Their food may be good, but this experience was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I love crab fried rice and crispy spring rolls, good portion and reasonable price. The waitress is the best, I love her smile :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch and got some crab fried rice and spring rolls. Food was good and service was excellent. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, great food, reasonable prices! Chicken Pad Thai is my fav!"}
{"text":"I decided on this place because honestly it was the only menu I had at work and I was craving Thai food. After surveying the menu, I decided to try their Shrimp Pad Thai and their stuffed chicken wings.  I placed the order on the phone and the man who answered the phone was very friendly. He took my delivery order and informed me it would take approximately 45 minutes. He forgot to tell me the price but I didn't think anything of it. My food was, in fact, delivered in 45 minutes. My biggest issue was with the delivery man. He approached my desk and I immediately asked him, \"Hi, how much?\" so I could pull the funds out of my card. He sarcastically responded, \"Well hello to you too. How are you? I'm fine\". I found this to be really rude and had I been given the price on the phone, I wouldn't need to be asking my question in the first place. It gets worse... After he gives me the total, it ended up being about $22.25. I ended up giving him $26.00 flat and told him to keep the change. He had the audacity to ask me if I had the $.25. Seriously?! I adamantly told him, \"No, I do not\" and I knew exactly why he asked me. He wanted me to give him the $.25 so he could pocket a full four dollars. In my entire life of people delivering me food, I have never been asked to provide the change. Ridiculous... As for the food, I can't even say that it was out of this world. I'm picky about ordering Pad Thai from a Thai restaurant. It was nothing special. The shrimp in the dish were large and delicious, but the overall flavor was mediocre. The consistency was slightly off and it probably could of used more peanuts to fix this. The stuffed chicken wings were ok. When I opened the dish, I saw a bunch of cucumbers and vegetables. I had to wrestle my way down to the bottom to get to the chicken wings. The wings were crunchy and the filling of beef and noodles was ok, but slightly bland in taste. I would recommend the put some spices and/or seasonings for the stuffing to give it a little flavor push. I was going to give this place 1 star mainly based on the the negative experience I had with the delivery man. Who would want this guy representing their establishment with his unprofessional manner? I decided to be more than generous and give one more star based on the friendliness of the man who took my order over the phone and the mediocre food I got. But will I be ordering from here again? Definitely a no."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place to eat. Service is fast and friendly with a smile. My favorite  is the tofu panang, lots of flavor and sauce to go with the fluffy white steaming rice. Can't  go wrong with a sauvignon blanc or a Thai brewski with the meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at King & I.  I love the fact that they will make my food as spicy as I want...which is quite spicy!  The owner seems to know a lot about wine and everytime we order a bottle, he has always given a a great recommendation and the bottle price is reasonable too.  The waitstaff are all very nice and must like where they work as I have never seen one of them without a big smile on.  I like the ambiance and there is always good music playing.  Mongolian and basil chicken are among my favorites."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and each time I really enjoyed the food.  I love the fact that they will make the food as spicy as I like...which I always tell them \"number 5\".  We have tried several appetizers...fried shrimp, spring rolls, wontons...all were very tasty.  Then for the main dish, we have had combo Lo Mein, Mongolian Chicken and Basil Chicken...which were all yummy and fiery like we asked.  The owner is always very attentive and makes sure all customers feel welcome.  The server we have had both times is very attentive, hard working and friendly.  She was always there asking right as we needed something else.  My husband and I definately like this quaint, good vibe restaurant by The Lakes!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Nice place on the inside but the food was just ok. I ordered the pad thai and there was just something funky tasting in it, almost like vinegar. It wasn't bad food but I wouln't go there again."}
{"text":"King and i @ the Lakes is the best Thai and Chinese restaurant there is .....period ..... here in Las Vegas. I've been coming here for the last 7 years at least twice a week. Food is absolutely amazing , full of flavor with just the right amount of spice. So yummy and delicious , i am sooooo addicted. Service is excellent and they even deliver. How you going to beat that ?????? .......  Nobody and i mean nobody does it like the King and i"}
{"text":"We tried this place through Groupon & to start it all off, we got the four or more deal & the lady refused our coupon due to us being a party of three. Which was kind of understandable. Secondly, I checked in on yelp & yelp had an offer of checking & receiving a free soda. Which they did not honor due to new management. Which was a little annoying. Why have to offer if it's not honored? Well, I ordered the pad Thai & it wasn't really \"IT\". I've had real Thai food before & I'm not sure if it was because the place is a Thai/Chinese restaurant but I don't think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Use to get their overpriced food for years, until one time when I got delivery. Keep in mind I would drop on an average $50-$100 an order at this place. They knew my name, my order, my voice, I was a regular. So one night I order my usual and spend around $70 plus my usual tip for pick up or delivery $10. I got the pork larb and half of it is purely fat. Nasty! I went back the next day to see if I could get my money back and they refused. I told them about the fat and they said it's always like that (she opened the container and was squeezing the fatty meat) which is bs, because I have ordered that dish so many times from them in the past. They included the throw away pieces for half of my dish and they wouln't give me my money back, which I think now was around $10 give or take. The woman at the front, whom by the way was clipping her finger nails, said I could get something else. I didn't want the food, but my friend told me to just go ahead and get it and maybe I could give it to someone else, but ended up throwing it away since I didn't want to take the chance on someone getting sick. I couldn't believe that they were arguing with me and wouldn't give me my money back especialy since I was such a loyal, good paying customer for so many years. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. I've eaten here once or twice since my 20 year stay in The Lakes, and this last time, the food was so awful it was inedible. The softshell crab was overpoweringly fishy and the person I was eating with actually began to gag to the point where they needed to use the bathroom. I was very disappointed, because even my pad thai had a bizarre, low quality taste that implied it had either been left out all night or just scraped off the floor. I've never complained at a restaurant and I absolutely don't have high standards for food, but this was just the worst meal I have ever had. I'd have driven back and asked them to taste what they sold me (for twenty dollars) and see if they would be able to eat it if it weren't raining. Horrible."}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly service.  Location might make it hard to find, but it is close to Sahara and Ft. Apache."}
{"text":"I work pretty close to this amazing spot so they deliver for me all the time (lucky me).  There is no minimum order that they require for my delivery order either.  I love their:  Hot and Spicy Beef Combination Noodle Soup, if you have ever had Thai boat noodle before, this is as close as it gets and then some. This unique bowl of yummy goodness consists of beef, beef meatballs, Chinese broccoli, and a bold flavor of spices.    Their papaya salad (Som Tum) is not too great and consistent.  I always request for extra extra spicy and it never is. What i usually get is always either too sweet or never enough salt. :(   The Shrimp Tom Yum Goong however is really good and spicy as i always request it.  The customer service is as good as delivery service should be....Great! This bowl consists of squid, shrimp, octopus, mushrooms, onion, and a nice sour tang from the lime juice.  My request on spice was so on point, my husband choked sipping on the broth....mmmm just how i like it!  The Shrimp Springrolls on the other hand consists of wayyyy too much romaine lettuce and not enough shrimp.  :/   Despite some unsatisfying dishes, I still love this place due to their nice delivery service.  I will just order what i know is good from now on."}
{"text":"Don't waste your $. Service was good but food is no where near authentic. Everything is extra sour and and sweet. And be aware that if you have a party of 6 or more there is a 'surcharge' and they don't tell you until you questioned the bill."}
{"text":"Don't even bother with dinner. About $ 30.00 per couple without alcohol. Very little meat in any of the main dishes (our group ordered 6); smallish portions unable to share. Spicing seems to be random regardless of the selection at ordering. Dated, cluttered dining room that seems more appropriate for a 60's Pizza Joint (not in a good way). None of us plan on returning. The Pad Thai was left uneaten - it was just very poorly prepared and Diabetics Beware - they really sweeten that stuff."}
{"text":"Went to this business a week ago as we had a 2 for 1 in the entertainment book. It is definitely a local establishment nestled in a small shopping center in the lakes area. First red flag in general for me was the picture menu. Standard Thai fair, panang, red curry, yellow curry, etc. Food was good, again pretty standard. Prices were average $10 or so an entry. Overall though my favorite for the same price or maybe a tad bit more is Lotus of Siam, but if you aren't willing to drive down there this would definitely more than suffice.   I had the panang, my favorite unadventurous dish, and it was good - not out of the ordinary good but good. We had the Tom Kha Kai which had a large portion, chicken was dry however that seems to be the case at most places with this soup as it is hard to boil chicken and keep it tender."}
{"text":"Came here because the Pho place next door was lifeless.  Watched the Bama-ND BCS game, eye-flirted with a single in the booth across from me, and enjoyed AMAZING Pad Thai in its jungle-like decor.  I almost asked for a second order to take home for the next day.  The noodles were melt-in-your-mouth soft, which contrasted nicely with the fresh bean sprouts and shrimp.  They were also sugary and chow-fun shaped; though personally I liked the effect it might alienate purists or dislikers of msg.  Also not sure if the quick service extends to more than the noodles (easy to keep in a pot).  It was also a slow night for them   Oh, and if you haven't been there, it's worth knowing the exterior isn't very imposing (small place in strip mall).  Will I go back?  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably be a regular.  As it is with their prices though I'll probably just start using sugar in home-made pad thai.  Maybe it'd be fun to take a date or go again to see if that cute single visits...  Pro: really fast service-- literally under the time it took to wash my hands-- casual atmosphere despite ambitious decor FRESH food (crisp bean sprouts & shrimp) Con: Dinners start @ $10/plate Noodles sugary (more than other Pad Thai I've had) and soft  Update:  went there a second time.  The green curry is great, and the decor was better than remembered. This place is a gem, and worth the price if you like good Thai."}
{"text":"Why the poor reviews? Came here with my girlfriend yesterday and they were all nice. Thanks and loved the fried rice!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE thai food! With that being said, I strongly believe that pad thai is the easiest and most popular dish at Thai restaurants. So, I would expect it to be nothing short of delicous... or at least edible for that matter. My pad thai arrived extremly greasy, with no flavor! I have no idea how they cooked it, or how long they cooked it for... but my noodles turned into a giant plate of flour mush glistened with oil! BOO!!! Never again my friend... Never again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food... always love coming here.  The atmosphere is very cozy and family style and the staff always makes you feel welcome.  My favorite Thai restaurant in town! :)"}
{"text":"Summary:  Excellent volume for the price, especially for lunch specials.  Food is great, but I must say that this place (along with Archi's) actually provide decent service.  I don't want to stereotype, but must of the other Thai restaurants that I go to offer horrible service (by waitresses)."}
{"text":"good Chinese food is apparently as easy to find as good pizza around here. I ordered from here hoping it was better than the subpar place I usually ordered. It was worse. I ill add the following disclaimer: I ordered it for Chinese food. Maybe their thai dishes are better but I'm not going to find out."}
{"text":"Great service, great dishes. Tried the Khua Kling (Dry Curry) with beef as the meat and it's the most flavorful and SPICY dish I've ever had. Prepare to drink 8 glasses of water and a bowl of comped cucumbers (it's that hot). Will definitely be back and have my family check out that dish specifically."}
{"text":"Our family loves King & I. It's cozy, the staff is  wonderful and the food is always delicious.  The gang dang curry and war wonton soup are our faves but everything is good.  Best thai in the neighborhood by far."}
{"text":"If you don't like this restaurant, you can't be pleased and should eat at home!  My husband and I have been customers of King and I for 15 years and it is by far the best Thai food in Vegas.  The service is excellent and Linda and Carl, the owners, will, on a moments notice, alter the dish to your liking.  The atmosphere is friendly and hospitable - a small Mom and Pop type ambience.  But the food is not Mom and Pop --- it is LV Strip quality and the Orange Roughy is outstanding.  Also...Linda does an excellent job of catering and has on many occasions helped me with parties and the food is always freshly prepared and beautifully displayed.  $$$ - their prices are very reasonable; I would say very affordable if you are on a tight budget.  My husband and I eat at K&I at least twice a week.  My sister and her family love it as well...and you can be sure that you will be greeted with a familiar smile and a hug from Linda as you enter and leave the King & I Thai and Chinese Restaurant at The Lakes, Nevada.

{"text":"I love SQUID, and They have the best \"Squid Basil\" in town. And I believe they have the best \"Chicken Basil, Beef Basil or any meat with Basil as well. The sauce is the BOMB!!!  My new favorite place now!!! :)"}
{"text":"We got a certificate to try this place from Restaurants.com.  When we got there we ordered what we normally order when we go to other Thai restaurants. When we got their food we were happily surprised at the large sizes of the entree's.  The food itself was mediocre at best.  While there my daughter needed to use the restroom, which is right by the kitchen - practically in it, they were out of paper towels so I looked under the sink to see if any were down there.  Instead of paper towels I found it swarming with tons and tons of cockroaches.   Ewwww, in an eating establishment.  Later that evening we got upset stomachs.  Will never eat there again.  Surprised it is even able to pass a health inspection."}
{"text":"Have gotten mostly carry out from this location which has always been good.  Finally went to dine in on a Saturday for the first time and had a very tasty lunch.  Hubby was craving pad thai and it was cooked to the perfect level of spice.  i ordered chicken and veggies and it was yummers.  We ordered the lunch specials and the prices were excellent with good portions.  The service was attentive, however, my only issue would be that the food does not come out at the same time.  It appears that the food is made one entree at a time. if not for that, I would have rated this a 5.  We'll definitely be back.  Maybe my #1 and I will order the same entree so we can eat together.  :)"}
{"text":"luv the atmosphere, good food, nice staff.our Server was Phang, would give her 5 star customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! Their lunch specials are around $7 and include a spring roll, salad, and nice portioned entree. If you're a student at Unlv they give a discount too! Their food is delicious and would definitely suggest checking it out if you're in the area (:"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 10 years! The food is always hot and delish. I really love that even after all these years they have kept the restaurant cozy. I love the intimate atmosphere. The server is always the same lady and she is so sweet and loves our little son. The green curry is outstanding!!! This is the only place in town I go very regularly for sit in and take out."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for 15+ yrs and we USED to love this place. The owners were great and all the servers were nice. Well we went back today, a Saturday afternoon and we were the only people in there, it was dead. We thought that was pretty rare and odd, well we ended up figuring out it's because of their new servers. From the moment we got there the lady was a total witch. Every single thing she did was done with attitude, not once did I see her even try and put on a fake smile at least. We received our food and it was eh, nothing great at all. Not what it used to be or compared to their other locations.  We were so fed up with her that when we were leaving we decided to ask her if she knew what guest/customer service is and she rolled her eyes and just sipped on her drink the whole time. Her name is V or B, so if you get her, I guarantee you will not be satisfied by her service. We're never coming back here."}

{"text":"Being that I'm from Seattle, I have a hard time finding good Thai anywhere I go because nothing compares. I got take out from here and found the Phad Thai quite good. I also ordered fresh spring rolls--the wraps were a little chewey, they must have prepared them earlier in the day. That was my only qualm. Friendly staff. I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your money here. I ordered shrimp pad thai and the mongolian beef. All the vegetables tasted like they were out of a can, the shrimp was hard as a rock and I took one bite of the beef and threw it out. Not tender, some kind of cheap cut and greasy. Find somewhere else to eat!!"}
{"text":"Prices are very high for the quality of food.  I took some of the food back and they did refund me but no way should they think the prices are ok.  Also when I went in I had to walk all over glass.  The front window broke and they made no attempt to clean it up.   After I left I had to pick pieces out of my dress shoes.   I was hoping they were better but I guess go down the strip mall a little more and get good quality food."}
{"text":"I love king and I.  My absolute fave dish is Yellow curry with chicken.  I always order it super spicy.   The staff is great,  friendly,  big smiles.    Today I ordered my usual and as expected.... It was perfect.  Lunch portion is filling,  and their to go presentation is nice.    The establishment is very small so I wouldn't recommend a large group."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Pad thai was flavorless and very dry...it was definitely missing that pad thai taste... The dumplings were soggy and tasted funny. I will say that the duck was good. My dog liked it as well"}
{"text":"Having tried pad thai throughout the city, state, nation, and Canada I can vouch for the higher quality in King and I. This is a quintessential hole in the wall, foodies thai dream.  I am actually writing this review while sitting in another thai, Chinese fusion place and the aroma is making me crave that of King and I."}
{"text":"The food was just standard thai food, nothing spectacular. Greasy, if anything. The service is where it hits rock bottom.  I had ordered it for delivery and didn't look at the receipt until later.  There was a discrepancy with my bill where a coupon was suppose to be applied. I noticed the mistake and called them back. The lady, I'm assuming is \"Linda\" as my receipt says, said \"You can use that coupon for the next visit\", then next excuse \"the credit card machine is closed\",...uhhh, really? and then etc, etc. After back and forth conversations, she was making it really difficult and even insulting saying that it's \"ONLY 5 dollars\". I understand it may only be \"$5\", but she was rude in every way, and at this point, I knew I was never coming back again.   So yes lady, I do want my $5 back.  Finally, she said she would refund me the difference, while making snide remarks the whole time, and finally \"I'll get that money back to you\" and just hung up on me."}
{"text":"We ordered off the lunch menu and when we got the check they charged us for regular entrees. I guess let them know you want the lunch special because pointing and reading off the lunch menu is not enough for them to understand. Normally at other places they at least ask you if you want the lunch special or the regular entree. It was not busy during the time of visit and they brought one plate out and then took 10 minutes to bring the next plate out."}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem. Authentic Thai cooked dishes, and especially the Pad See Ew and Green Curry dishes were exceptional. Fast and friendly service, and you get candy a to finish the meal. A little out of the way, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food was terrible & we ended up throwing away at least half of it. The Mongolian beef was awful. The Pad Prik Khing was terrible. The sweet and sour chicken was all deep friend batter-some pieces didn't even have chicken!!! The Tom Yum Shrimp soup was not good. My daughter liked her papaya salad and I thought mine was average-that is it out of a $70 order. Usually I never write reviews, but this was so bad I felt compelled. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Not to mention that Yelp did not honor my $5 coupon for my 1st order on Eat 24. I won't be using them again-back to BiteSquad and Postmates!!!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten their food once and LOVED it. I did a take out and the green curry with shrimp was so good...it wss actually to die for.  The spring rolls were good too. And what I was really impressed about that they did have brown rice on the menu (happy dance) I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it no stars. Catered an order for 200 of vegetarian dishes. Paid for the order in full prior to and had her repeat my order several times. It even had vegetarian on the receipt. A coworker picked up the order. We prepared to serve it and noticed all the dishes contained chicken. I called back about the problem, Linda's response was, \" I don't know what to tell you\". Don't waste your time with this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent green curry and everything else was tasty. Portions are small... Location is so central and easy to find. Don't be scared by the strip mall appearance the interior is cozy and comfortable."}
{"text":"My first time here for dinner but always come for lunch.  I can't get enough of King and I, cozy intimate and yummy.  I tried their Tom Yum Goong soup for the first time and it completely hit the spot.  I really liked that it came to the table in it's own burner, cute touch"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underdelivered.  If I order a dish that has meat as the main ingredient, unsurprisingly I expect it to contain an entree portion of meat.  I would have NEVER paid $12 for 37 cents worth of sautéed veggies in broth and a half ounce of meat. This corner-cutting, blatantly cheap maneuver on their part is completely unacceptable.  GTFO!!   It wasn't one dish, but rather several.  Cheap bastards"}
{"text":"Just had catering from King and I (Tropicana location) for a school event at UNlV. Chef Tu and his crew members were nice and thoughtful to our UNLV faculty and students. We couldn't have such successful event without them. And last but not the least, the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is one of best authentic Thai we ate so far. This is a family business run by very genuine and humble people. Everytime we come to Vegas we never fail to visit them. We keep trying their different dishes and each never fails to amaze us. Located next to Vons on Tropicana Ave, not a very busy and attractive place may be their negative aspect. But ignore their location and try their food and homely behavior, you will never fail to visit them everytime you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Good curry and Thai fried rice! For having Chinese on their menu it was surprisingly good. In fact some of the best chow mien I  had in Vegas. Sometimes it can be a little greasy. Over all thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food and great value!  A hidden gem in the lakes area.  Prices reasonable and quality good.  Can't say much more... if you get a chance try it!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here on and off for the past 3 years.  Their Lunch special has always included the choice of thai tea.  Yesterday, we were charged for them, by owner,  Linda's quirky husband.   He changes his pricing at will...Also, I have ordered exactly the same thing as my husband, and my portion is always smaller.  I asked them why, they said men always get larger portions, even though we pay the same.  That's why we stopped going.  Yesterday, we were starving, it was convenient, so we went in.  The place was dead.  We ordered.  When the food came, ( while we were still eating our large bowl of soup) again,  hubby's portion was twice the size of mine.  Their portion size is never consistant, depends on if you are one of their favorites. We struck up up a conversation with the only other person in the place...Linda's husband aggressively approaches our table and asks if we are finished.  We had obviously not finished.  I told him no, we were still eating.  Like he wanted us to leave.  He returns in a minute, interupts our conversation again and asks if we wanted a box, I said ok, by then I just wanted to leave.   He and server don't ask if we want to save our large bowl of soup, just dumps other bowls and spoons into the soup, so we could not save it.  The thai tea rip off followed as we paid.   I really liked the location, near our home, near the lake, a cozy,  relaxed place, we put up with the strange \"traditions\" but the owners are so unprofessional,  weird and rude.  Sometimes Linda is sweet and welcoming, the next time, she's ice cold...  Their unprofessional additude has finally overshadowed the food, which, by the way was once delicious. ( Very bland this time, chicken was of questionable quality...)after the way we were treated today, we will never come back. If you are one of their favorites, you'll be fine.  If not, do like we will from now on, drive further for better food and much better hospitality.  Never Again!!!"}
{"text":"It was decent...that is pretty much what I have to say about this.  I just moved to this location and found there was another King & I (this location) and thought it was going to be the same as the Tropicana location.  I can finally admit I was wrong.  I have ordered from this place at least four times since I have moved into this location and every time I get disappointed.  Last night was the straw that broke the camel's back.  The time before they fail to take my credit card number and last night they forgot the beverages and had to go back to get it.  Food is a-ok nothing to rave about and I am sure there are better.  But I will say it is decent.  I am not too crazy about their satay but the pad thai was decent.  Their soups are not so great and too sweet when it should be sweet, spicy and sour.  I don't think I will go back willingly...and I found out that there is a $2 delivery charge fee.  This is the first I heard of it...hmmmm...disappointing."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery. Took over an hour so was a little longer than I wanted, however, food was amazing! I got the pad Thai noodles with chicken and spicy fried rice with basil. Both surpassed my expectations. Best Thai I've had in a while. I have attached pics as well."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I've had both the pad Thai, most of the curry, the calamari, wontons, Thai iced tea.   Basically I would go back all the time."}
{"text":"I ordered online and it was delivered in a timely manner. The food was great and came with more than i expected."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for good Thai food. It is located at the University Plaza and it is a further walkway from Vons. The moment you enter, you will see a beautiful layout of the dining area. I do love the earthy nature of rustic wood and rocky walls paired with a shimmery bronze décor. Quite frankly, I think the people here are very friendly and accommodating. I am a patient person and I can understand why sometimes service is delayed, but do keep in mind it does take some time to prepare certain meals. What's most impressive is that the owner Joe not only manages the restaurant, but he also goes above and beyond service to personally deliver take-out meals.  I ordered the Pad Thai Tamarind Sauce with a choice of Chicken ($13.95). I know tamarind sauce can be sweet. In order to balance the sweetness, you will need to add something spicy or sour. They do offer three spicy condiments (red chili sauce, chili pepper flakes, and vinegar with jalapenos) that are set to the side of the table. The meal comes with rice vermicelli noodles sautéed in tamarind sauce, chunks of tender chicken breast, bean sprouts, and served with shredded carrots, red cabbage, crushed peanuts, and cilantro. Of the three spicy condiments, I think the vinegar with jalapenos is the best choice to complement and enhance the flavor of the noodles. From personal experience dining at other Thai restaurants, the Chicken Pad Thai here taste flavorful. The tamarind sauce in my dish didn't taste too sweet, which is a major plus because I usually steer away from anything that has too much sweetness.   For dessert I had the Mango Sticky Rice ($8). I am pleasantly amazed that the sticky rice comes as a generous portion with plenty slices of sweet, juicy mango. The sticky rice is served warm, it's drizzled with a nice coconut flavored cream sauce and topped with sprinkles of sesame seeds. I've always enjoyed a good meal with dessert, and this dessert is my top favorite! One customer had glanced over and is enticed how yummy and abundant the Mango Sticky Rice is served. It prompt the customer to want an order of that too. It just shows that good food is meant to be shared."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the King and I for approx 25 years  which says a lot. It is with sadness i write the review as the service and quality has gradually declined these past years.  It seems like the passion and the friendliness has taken a back seat .  I wont be returning for at least another 6 months. ill keep an eye on the reviews and hopefully things will change. perhaps it is just time for the owners to look at other things. They have served the community so well and provided such a great place it really saddens me to see the downslide. i wont be rude and go into specifics."}
{"text":"King & I has one of the best yellow currys & Pad thai i've ever had. Full of vegetables & super tasty and love the spice! On a trip to Vegas, I took my hubby to try it and he absolutely loved it too! He thinks it's the best thai food he's had... though, he's only been to maybe 3 or 4 different Thai places... but still, a place we'll eat every time we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend their yellow chicken curry. Wasn't a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice. The guy that works there flirts with me every time I go there and takes my to-go order to my car. LOL!"}
{"text":"I have been eating for 15 years  the food is amazing Linda  is  is always helpful and nice great place to eat"}
{"text":"I was at King & I for the first time with my family today.  I am always looking for good Thai food in town. After reading the review I was excited to try it. To my surprise it was the WORST service I've ever had...! I have NEVER felt so Discriminated. Ended up paying for my food and asking them to pack it to go. I was the first table there and the last to be served. We ordered four dishes nothing exotic just rice,noodles, soup, and beef Food was terrible. And over priced $46.33 for that.  I will never go back. They brought us lemonade without us asking for it."}
{"text":"Good Thai food is hard to find but King and I is one of those Thai restaurant that is good. The flavor and taste is excellent and the price is reasonable. It's a hidden little restaurant but if you get lost in Summerlin, go here and try their food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"delicious food, good prices. great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the worst Pad Thai I have had in a while. I think there are much better options out there."}
{"text":"Bummer!  New management must mean new cooks and/or recipes.   Every time I came to Vegas for business I'd eat here or get take out at least once. Tonite was no exception. However the exception about tonite is that it will be my last time eating here.   Tom Yum Goong soup had at least a 1/4 cup of VERY large woody lemon grass pieces. I had to pick all of it out it before I could eat the soup. There was a large quartered tomato in the soup(?). Filler??  Broth wasn't very clear and it was a bit oily. There was a generous amount of shrimp. Way, way too many mushrooms though. Nicely spiced though.   The \"King and I\" signature rice dish lacked pineapple chunks and cashews. The pork was nice, chicken a bit dry. There were only 2 shrimp in the dish and they lacked flavor. The rice was sticky and slightly sweet.  Not anywhere near the quality it used to be.   Portions for each were smaller and more expensive than what I recall.    When I called to place my pick up order I wasn't asked if I wanted spicy or not. I asked for extra chili sauce just in case. Good move on my part.   Sad. This was my go to place in Vegas. I'd even entertain clients here on occasion if they weren't pretentious."}
{"text":"Food is ok, Server is nice, But the price is VERY HIGH! Their price went up. Not worth it for the quality of food you are getting. Even with the groupon. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas! Friendly and fantastic service every time."}
{"text":"Great service. Got the pad Thai but the noddles were slightly chewy. I'm used to the traditional flat noodles use in this dish. Got a lemongrass shrimp soup (forgot what it's called) and it was delicious but a little on the sweeter side. Also got the spicy eggplant and although it was good I would've liked the other veggies in this dish to be more sautéed instead of crunchy."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with an ex coworker, they have really good lunch specials. It comes with a lot of sides! Your meal plus side salad, wonton strips, egg roll & egg drop soup. Our server provided excellent service! She was very timely & attentive, food came out fast which we appreciate. Especially during our lunch break. I ordered to go & it was ready just in time. The only minor thing, is it is very small inside & when we ate there the air wasn't well ventilated. We were literally sweating eating our curry. Felt very humid but food is great! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Still the best place for Thai food in town. Been coming here for 20 years. Don't be fooled by the location and the shopping center. It's a delicious classic!"}
{"text":"Lisa was a pleasant hostess and was quick at delivery. She offered the best of the menu and was very efficient at her job.  On the table: King & I fried rice, a blend of seafood, poultry, meat, and the good ol' Thai spices that make the fried rice aromatic and flavorful.   Duck Curry which is exactly what it states,  duck in  Thai curry sauce. So creamy and spicy and meaty.    Thai Tea is always on point.   I frequented this place more often in my recent past so I am very pleased to return with the same good service and good food.   Thank you for the experience."}
{"text":"If I worked or went to school in this area, King and I would be my to go Thai food without a doubt. Their lunch specials are irresistible!  The decor at this location is one of a kind. It's as if I'm dining in a log cabin adorned with beautiful Thai decorations.  Now, as for the food items, I was impressed by: The chicken satay, the crispy duck and curries. Pad Thai isn't anything too memorable--I don't think I found it very flavorful.   It's nice that King and I has other locations :)."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.   I had the lunch special chicken pad thai which came with fried rice, soup, an egg roll, and a small salad. I wasn't a fan of the soup, which was described as a \"chicken noodle\" (rice vermicelli noodles in a chicken stock with a pitiful amount of small chicken chunks in it)- it was very bland, but I didn't show up for the soup so I wasn't concerned with it. The salad was pretty good- I'm pretty sure it was dressed with some sort of sweet chili sauce vinaigrette which was perfect because I used the leftover dressing at the bottom of my bowl of salad to dip my egg roll. The fried rice was typical, pretty tasty in that bland fried rice kind of way (seriously, I really enjoyed it). The pad thai, although not as good as my mom makes, was pretty darn good. The chicken wasn't over done or dry which was a good sign and I didn't have to ask for any lime which is unheard of.   Chao Thai is down the street, and I think their lunch specials might taste a touch better (at least I can say that for their pad thai), their customer service was severely lacking. I'd rather spend my money here."}
{"text":"I am a thai food junkie and had the pad thai and pad kee mao. The pad kee Mao was slightly different then I'm used to (they use broccoli and a different spice) but it was amazing nonetheless and the vegetables were fresh.The pad thai was better than your average. Delivery service was quick and a really nice driver"}
{"text":"My scallops had a very bitter taste almost like ammonia food alert at this place"}
{"text":"We always enjoy this mom and Pop, friendly Thai restaurant whenever we visit Las Vegas. We have been going there for several years. We were back there again recently and once again, everything was outstanding. My kids love the Thai fried rice, but I couldn't get enough of the green curry.  Here's a tip: order the mango juice. It is freshly made on site from real mangoes. It is not from concentrate. And it is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small but the atmosphere delivers a good vibe. The decorations are tasteful and the service was outstanding.  The Pad See Ew was rich in flavor and spices. My only quarrel was the portion size. Perhaps the dish was slightly less than generous because I ordered it off the lunch menu but I would have expected more nonetheless.  The Pad Thai was something to rave about. The chicken was tender and the noodles were cooked to perfection with an excellent flavor and aftertaste. The portion was ample.  I happen to live near the restaurant so they'll definitely be seeing me more often."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again.  Food wasn't all the great. Ordered 4 meals.. 2 of the meals where still cold, like it was just taken from a refrig and warmed up. Asked if we could get something else.. Was told no and that the food was prepared especially for us..clearly it came from the microwave and then to the table. The service was horrible. No customer service. Maybe better off going to The Lakes King and I. Different owners and probably better customer service and better cooked food!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food at the King & I, but more importantly I liked the personal attention I received from the host, which was remarkable. Highly recommend my two favorites, the chicken sate and the pork panang curry."}
{"text":"Stopped here today and we were pleasantly surprised! Decor is great! Food was very delicious and fresh!   We've tried a few Thai places in Las Vegas since we moved here in June and this is probably the best so far!   Items ordered:  Thai spring rolls Glass noodle salad with chicken and shrimp Ginger seafood dish Pad Woon Sen with chicken Yellow Curry (substituted yellow curry sauce for green curry sauce)  Dishes can run a bit spicy, i found, but i am a wuss."}
{"text":"This is the first time I am writing a review on Yelp. Sure, it's a negative one! This place has the WORST customer service ever!   I was a customer here for a while, and only because their location is convenient and they deliver I stayed loyal and ordered food on a regular basis. The  FOOD is very average, my boyfriend didn't like it at all,as he knows what a good Thai food is, but since I am limited in my choices as I am vegetarian, I could live with it. It's hard to spoil tofu, you know.I agree with other reviewers, the food is different every time, and I had to \"enhance\" the flavor with bunch of sauces from my fridge.   Today I ordered as usual a soup and two main dishes. My procedure to order is the same- I always make sure they understand it is a vegetarian order and I will get tofu and veggies instead of meat. To my surprise- I received an order with Tofu in the soup only! The main dishes were just bunch of veggies!   Ok, I call them up and talk to the same person who took the order. I think he said his name is Kal or something like that. To my surprise, he started to argue with me and say that I ordered only veggies! His English is somewhat limited I think. But it didnt stop him from being extremely rude! He  said  he heard my order  very well, and that I didn't make it clear what I want, and that if he had a recording he would prove I am wrong! He didn't offer anything to do about the issue as if I am calling just to say hello! He was very rude, especially when I insisted they fix the mistake in one way or another. He told me not to teach him what to do! Who talks like this? Especially to a customer? This argument was very frustrating for me. At the end  he said he can send me some tofu so I can add it and mix it up! Not to mention that one dish even didn't have mushrooms,though they are listed on the menu! At this point I got very angry myself and said I will cancel the credit card charge as I am not paying $38 for veggies  and I do not want to wait another hour for a tofu to come in, then  he offered a 20% discount on my next order, though I made it clear I have no desire to order from them any more. He even didn't care about that.  So, if you don't want to spoil your day and deal with these people- order somewhere else, I wish I read reviews on Yelp before I payed them hundreds of dollars this year! I am sure there should be a better Thai delivery place in 89117 area!"}
{"text":"They have amazing Cream Cheese Wontons! They also offer delivery, so thats a huge plus!!! Always quick as well when I order delivery. I order at least once a month."}
{"text":"Really great food. Quiet and small, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the lakes where I grew up. Great panang curry and wontons!"}
{"text":"This spot was a pleasant surprise! When I'm in this area, I'm usually craving a light vegan meal (at Go Raw) or good bar food (at Lake's Lounge). I was nearby on a day when neither option sounded good, so I gave King & I a try.  KING & I STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS: A familiar dish done really well, wings stuffed with pork and glass noodles. Not too greasy, four piece order for $8.  DUCK NOODLE SOUP: Duck plus noodles, in a savory brown soup with cilantro and bean sprouts. The best and worst part was the broth, which was extremely rich and flavorful, but entirely too greasy to enjoy the entire portion.  KING & I FRIED RICE: Fried rice with the usual mix of meats (shrimp, chicken, bbq pork) and the addition of pineapple and cashews. The last two ingredients made me hesitant to order this, but they made the dish! The nuts added a nice texture and the citrus helped cut the excess oil. Menu describes this as spicy and I didn't detect any heat at all, added in an entire cup of chili oil and it was just right.  It's small, and nicely decorated- definitely a neighborhood kind of spot, I really enjoy the ambiance. Opted for a large takeout order, flavors were good and prices were fair.  Unfortunately, the excessive oil/grease used in a few of our dishes turns me off to coming here  frequently, but it's a solid option for rice and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY!!!!  Yelpers, you know those places that you know about, finally try and scream \"I CAN'T BELIEVE WE NEVER TRIED THIS!!\"  King & I is that place. It is by no means your average Asian food, so don't be surprised if the Orange Chicken is not what you are used to. Even the fried rice is very different. It's good, but it's not fried and sticky.  We went in to order take out. There service was mixed. the first woman was nice, the second was rude, the man was friendly, but short with us. Honestly, kind of typical of Asian restaurants in Vegas. The prices were reasonable. The portions are smaller than you may expect, but the quality more than makes up for it.   The food is not salty and you won't feel that \"blah\" laziness that you may after other similar food experiences.   GET THIS FOOD!! We will eat in next time."}
{"text":"Yummm I love the food here. We come here for lunch specials. The pad thai is great and the curry is delicious! I was so spoiled w thai food in LA and this reminds me of those flavors. The staff is friendly and quick and the restaurant itself is decorated so awesome complete w a fish tank. It gets busy for dinner. Its in the lakes plaza by the lake and a cute mini mart , vegan food and pizza. If you had a choice I choose the King and I thai food."}
{"text":"Prices here seem about $2 more than any other Thai place, but if the food matches up, then it can be overlooked for the most part. Wandered in for dinner about 9pm and very nice looking employee steered me towards the Singapore Noodles and I substituted chicken for BBQ Pork. This dish is an acquired taste because you have to like yellow curry for it to be effective. THe shrimp and chicken in the dish were both above average with the shrimp stealing the show. The curry flavor wasn't as strong as in some other places which is a good thing and overall the dish was a pretty good rendition of the standard with better meat. It would be better for under $10 which is what most places (especially around UNLV) should be charging. Probably worth another visit though."}
{"text":"Ordered prik King chicken. Gave it to the dog. :(  Nothing like how it should be. Maybe to European American people it's good, but to an Asian American, not so much.  Chicken tasted weird and the sauce was nothing like how it should be. It wa more brown than red."}
{"text":"First of all... The drive here has beautiful scenery. I mean man-made lakes are pretty special out here in a desert. I have to be able to see bodies of water or else I'll feel too far from home =/  This Thai hut is actually docked right next to the water. But unfortunately it doesn't have views of it. So, I said \"hut\" because it's not this huge restaurant. It's this little home-style HUT! The people here are sweet and treat you like family.  The food is always delicious and pretty filling. I guess if you're asking whats unique about it. I'd say that they actually have different flavors of sticky rice.   This is one of those rare spots that hide in the crevices of Summerlin."}
{"text":"Amazing food guys, it's a must go!  We had chicken fried rice, red curry & eggplant tofu. Everything tasted so good. We are already planning to go back!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for Thai! Been going here for years! Pad see-ew and the panaang curry are my favorites! Thai beef salad and crab fried rice is my \"healthy\" choice, lol. Service is always great, even though I always order to go. :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places to go to because the food is consistently really good, prices are reasonable and it's super close to my house.  The restaurant is quite small and tucked away in a retail complex in the Lakes, but it gives it a cozy, quiet neighborhood feel to the place.  The food is great -- I'm a fan of the spring rolls with the spicy dipping sauce, the pepper steak, their curries (try the panang curry -- it's peanut flavored, mmm), and their noodle dishes like the pad see ewe.  The portions are pretty big too (you get more food here than at Archi's, which is nearby).  Usually the food is served as requested in terms of how spicy it is, except for once incident where the green curry was much spicier than we would have liked, but it was still a very good curry.  Service is decent and they're pretty attentive about keeping your water glass full and checking in to make sure everything is going well.  Check this place out if you enjoy Thai food as much as I do :)"}
{"text":"Customer Service: I went here for dinner and the entire staff was so friendly! Our server checked on us multiple times to make sure we were okay, liked our meal and if we needed anything else. She saw that I did not drink very much of my Thai iced coffee and checked to see if I liked it or wanted something else because I had mentioned it was my first time trying it.   Food: We wanted the lunch special because it seemed like the perfect amount of food and we could try a variety of things. The waitress told us that we could have it for 2 dollars more which still only came out to 10 dollars, including a beverage. I got the pad thai which came with rice, a spring roll and a side of fruit. The pad thai was mediocre, a little too much on the sweet side for me.   Environment: The seating is a little limited but the decor is so cute. Going to the restroom was a little awkward because I felt like I was going into their kitchen because they were cutting up fruit near it.  Overall, I think it is great and you cannot beat the price!"}
{"text":"One star for the Pineapple Fried Rice, which is very good! It is prepared with shrimp and cashews and was a generous portion and thoroughly satisfying.   Minus 3 stars for the other dishes ... Spring rolls were meh, bbq ribs were just okay ... Kind of dry and skin was not crispy at all. My friend ordered the Pad Thai and did not care for it. I tasted it, and it seemed very sweet to me, but I am not a fan of rice noodles.  I will recommend this place for the Pineapple Fried Rice, but was not impressed by their other dishes."}
{"text":"It was okay, had a groupon for this place to try out. One of the workers speak very little english so it's hard for her to understand what you're trying to say or order. I am not trying to offend anyone, personally.  Their service is kind of slow, maybe 2 chefs working and 2 waitresses but that's about all. Some of their meals are too sweet or really salty. I was only looking for a place away from the strip since all of their restaurants sucked. The Thai Tea was really sweet you can taste the powder and the boba along with it, and it was ok.  Compared to the other Thai place I always eat to in OC, this place was okay, it didn't meet my standards but it's was also kind of expensive. Total cost was around $70 but the groupon covered more than half so it came out to be $30.  I would just recommend the Tom Yum Soup and Fried Rice, the soup can be salty but adding a little lemon would make it better. If the food was somewhat better, because I do feel bad that they're understaff and trying to make meet ends with the restaurant as well.   PS dont order the curry, majority of the presentation of the food is horrible..    oh and i think my stomach couldnt handle this it was hurting a little after"}
{"text":"Family-owned restaurant. Cool and peaceful interior decor. Awesome food. Tasty and authentic. Decent price. Try Fried Catfish with Tamarind Sauce, it's a bit spicy, but so yummmmy..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. This is the only Thai restaurant that I know that gives free refills on Thai tea. I love love love this place."}
{"text":"King and I at the Lakes is our go to Thai Place. Super close in our house and oh my goodness on their food.  I usually call and pick up my order because the place is so small and it's more convenient for us to enjoy our meal at home. We usually order a Duck, Panang Curry and Spicy Beef Salad and sometimes we'll order their Pad Thai.   Family owned, I guess and the lady who manage or owned the place is super nice and really interacts with her guest. Average wait time for food pick up is 20mins."}
{"text":"Red Chicken Curry is my go too! Absolutely delicious, I crave it ever week!  Fast and friendly service, small sitting area, so I always order to go."}
{"text":"Our whole office ordered delivery for lunch and we were more than satisfied.  I had the pad Thai and chicken satay....very good and the peanut sauce was to die for.  We will be ordering from here again for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious! This is a small little restaurant in the Lakes. I usually get the Panang Curry  when I'm eating here. It's absolutely delicious and I always have leftovers for my lunch the next day. They also have the best stuff chicken wings! The prices here is pretty reasonable compared to other Asian restaurants.   I will always go here to get my Thai Fix."}
{"text":"Beyond awesome food with excellent service dining in or delivery!  Huge portions and a great value.  My favorites are the Tom Kha Gai soup (it is a meal!) or the black pepper steak.   They also have awesome brown rice as an option.  Linda the owner is beyond nice and remembers your orders which speeds up the order process to just seconds!  Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"The ambience might be deceptive. Looks good but smells like an old place. Food was terrible. It was so salty that I fear to get high blood pressure. I ordered Pad See Mee (Drunken noodles) or whatever it is called! The quality of the ingredients were ridiculously stale. The sauce tray (where they put chilli and all) had a big hair on it. Seemed nobody cared to clean it. The waitress was good and polite. And that was the only positive thing.  Worst is the price! So since we were 7 people so they charged us 18% more on the check. I mean what the hell!  If you are planning to eat good THAI food I would suggest NOT to come here!"}
{"text":"I would've given them three but they quietly did not honor the 15% off for dinner for UNLV students which annoyed me to no end. I told the lady while paying that I was a student and she nodded her head assuming I wouldn't notice. I was disinclined to cause a scene because it's finals week and I'm already exhausted.  As for the food, it was ok. The fried shrimp appetizer is wrapped in a wonton skin, not as good as breaded shrimp, but not horrible. The yellow curry was decent, not too flavorful, but had a good amount of pork in it. I did like the fact that a large bowl of rice came with the dish. I also had the thai iced tea, again, decent, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Got here fast and the delivery guy was super nice! Tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars for the amazing food, HOWEVER... the customer service my friends and I received here was close to awful.  So we walk in and we are greeted by a woman who gives off a gruff \"How can I help you?\" With no smile. I decide to avoid her and head to the young man sitting at the cash register. He appears to be on the phone when I approach him, but the first thing he says is \"What's up, what do you want?\" LOL OOOKKAAYYY.  All I wanted was a Thai iced tea, man. Jeez.   Anywho, the food here is awesome despite the rude customer service. Must get items: Thai iced tea, pad see ew, and crab rangoons!"}
{"text":"I tried the coco mango salad today. It is so delicious!! Highly recommend :) I also love the shift shell crab!"}
{"text":"We had a good service and food in this restaurant. Their spicy eggplant with tofu and fried crab rice is great. Will definitely bring more friends over to try."}
{"text":"I came here back in late January and my friend raved about this place so, our friends all decided to have takeout here. We're ordered crab Rangoon, pad Thai, pad kee Mao, yellow curry chicken, fried rice, etc. I had a taste of everything and I was sooooooo disappointed with everything. I'm from SF and thai food here is amazing!  I was really looking forward to eating this meal until I opened my box and the noodles were so different. It wasn't the wide flat noodles they serve in SF- it was thin flat noodles that were so bland that soy sauce didn't even help boost the flavor. The fried rice was nasty but the curry chicken was the best. I wished I had ordered that instead. The staff were nice enough to call us a cab and give us all the utensil and paper plates needed for our group. The restaurant was cleaned but at the hour of 5:00pm, there was no one dining there a all."}
{"text":"I always question any restaurant that combines two different style of food and I was right (Thai and Chinese)  First customer service was good and the server was really nice and accommodating and she made sure our drinks were always filled.  And that's the best of this place.   I order the roughy and I was disappointed. It was drenched in sauce. If that fish was alive, he could have swam in that plate! It was too salty and lacked true flavor. I wished I ordered something else. There were too much ginger and not enough mushroom.   My FPIC ordered the pad thai and he said it was good...but it looked sad and  lacked a lot of garnish.   The thai ice tea was way too sweet. It was 20% tea and 80% cream....I couldn't finish the drink.   I wanted to enjoy this place but it was not appealing to the palate at all."}
{"text":"Decent place. Very friendly staff and tasty food !!!"}
{"text":"Everything was PERFECT!  Dying for peanut chicken and curry on my way home...a few hiccups with understanding when the order would be ready for pick up, but so worth a confusing phone call!    Crab Rangoon had a delicious, seasoned filling.  Peanut sauce was a little thick, but so flavorful.  Kung Pao chicken at medium heat smelled spicer then it was.  Yellow curry at medium.... PERFECT!  A little burn in the mouth, sweet vegetables, broth consistency was dead on.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food here is great.. Since i live in north Summerlin I always have to order more to get it delivered. I don't mind though.. Thai tea is always good, ground chicken and basil are Delish and pad see ew was always cooked well.."}
{"text":"The best authentic Thai in Vegas. It's a little small, but it's great because you can see them cooking your meals in the back. Get the soups and experience the real thai food."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from the Los Angeles area and came here with a group of 5 on the recommendation of someone that lives near this resturant. One person in our party ordered green curry and when the dishes came out, they gave her red curry. The person in our party told the waitress that she ordered green curry, the waitress argued and argued that red curry was ordered and refused to take it back and left it on the table. So my group member reluctantly ate it. I ordered Kung pow chicken and it was about the worst I ever had, but maybe it was my fault, ordering a Chinese dish at a Thai resturant. It was extremely salty. I tried my wife's mint beef dish and that was also very salty. Bottom line: service: thumbs down. Food: thumbs down."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are amazing and delicious. Very interesting and cool vibe inside. The spicy sauce is extremely hot so if youre into spicy, try it!! The employees are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout through roadrunnerfood.com only.  I've never been to the restaurant.  We've ordered from them twice and it's been tasty each time.  I've tried the Panang curry and the red curry.  Both were excellent.  The larb was also really good.  They have pork larb... yum! I also liked the spicy catfish.  The homemade chili sauce it came with was more like a curry.  Still, pretty good.  When we ordered the hot and spicy beef and meatball noodle soup to go, the noodles were packaged separately.  But we got confused and ended up mixing them with another dish, shrimp pad hot chili pepper, because we did not know what dish they were supposed to go with.  (I guess we forgot we ordered noodle soup.) So the soup wasn't all that good.  The shrimp pad hot chili pepper tasted good, but it wasn't supposed to be a noodle dish, apparently. I should probably just go to the restaurant and eat the dishes as intended.  Each time, we've asked the food to be \"very hot\" (aka spicy) but it has always come out pretty mild.  Luckily, they give us some hot sauce and chili pepper flakes.  But I'm not convinced that the food is the same if they just made it spicy in the first place.  I understand the reluctance to give truly spicy food to people through a third party delivery service.  So once again, we are probably going to have to visit the restaurant to eat the dishes as intended.  Still, I really dig this Thai food."}
{"text":"Primo prices for sub-par food. I recommend they change up their menu and pricing. Nothing special about their lunch specials."}
{"text":"I have ordered nearly 20 times in the two years I've lived in Vegas: I would say it was a 3.5 star rated food. Not bad but not amazing. But more and more their food has become bland and had almost a reheated texture. I will give it a break for some time and order again in a few months and see what I think:"}
{"text":"I love it here. The chicken fried rice and the tom yum soups are sooo good. Always leave satisfied and the portions are big too."}
{"text":"Fantastic family owned business. You can truly feel the love in the food as you taste all the unique and delicate flavors. Their vegetable pad thai is my hands downs favorite in town! They are friendly, and very personable. Support local business and visit the King & I today!"}
{"text":"Pretty great food. I had the pannang curry, and it was delicious and creamy. We had also the wontons, and there were a lot, but not incredibly tasty. Not bad though.  The service was great, and fast.  it was a nice break from the strip."}
{"text":"Been a long time since I've lived on this side of town but I still find myself driving down here when I have a craving for Thai food. All the entrees I've had here are delicious but I usually go for the Pad See Ewe and Stuffed Chicken Wings. The Panag Curry is also good and has a nice coconut taste to it. The waitresses are fast here no matter what you need and I feel like we're always in and out when we come here. The food comes out quickly and I've never had to wait more than 10 or 15 minutes which is excellent if you're on the go. The restaurant itself is fairly small, but I've never seen a full house nor a line here. I think it's because most of their customers order take out, which wouldn't be a bad idea if I lived closer. Highly recommend this place because it's one of my favorites in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai place in town as of this moment. First, it is only minutes from my house. However, I know that won't be the case for most other people so let me also assure you that the atmosphere is good. It has the ambiance of an authentic hole-in-the-wall eatery. It is small, but not usually crowded. It is in a small min-mart shopping area in the lakes, which is unique to say the least. Me and my boyfriend predictibly order the same thing every time: some kind of chicken curry, tom kha gai, and thai beef salad. We share everything and always have leftovers. If I have any room left, and it is in season, we will end with mango sticky rice. Get whatever you like but do not skip the mango sticky rice, its awesome!   Writing this review is making me hungry."}
{"text":"I dont eat much thai food, since i have a nut allergy and i fear i'm going to die. Much to pleading of my dear husband, i gave it a shot and i absolutely loved it!!! Tom Yun Goong soup is amazingly delicious. The shrimp was cooked to perfection. Our entree was hot and fresh. It was great. I will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in vegas! Found this place a little over two years ago, friendly atmosphere and delicious food"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed! I order pad see ew . There's not much noodle , you can barely see.  I didn't expect a carrot in pad see ew! You don't carrots in pad see ew, lol. I'm just disappointed because here's little noodle :( . It's too pricey for what I order ."}
{"text":"When faced with the ever-present conundrum of, \"what do you want to eat?\" my friend decided to bring me to The King and I for dinner. This restaurant is Thai and Chinese fusion, but since I was feeling more hungry than adventurous I stuck with one of my favorite Thai staples: green curry with chicken.   Unlike some other Thai restaurants I've been to, they don't let you choose your spice levels here. This could be a problem for those who are sensitive to spicy foods, but I thought they found the perfect balance of spice from the curry paste and creaminess from the coconut milk. Thai curry is all about balance of flavor as well as contrast of texture, and their green curry incorporated both of those elements.   The service is decent and prices are reasonable as well. Portions are sized to share, so if you have your eye on multiple dishes your group can just try a bit of everything.   The King and I is tucked away in The Lakes so it's a little hidden gem for your Thai food fix. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a negative review but it was such a terrible experience. The atmosphere is nice but extremely dusty. I went for lunch one day and food was ok. The second time I went the waitress was great but the guy who brought out the food was so rude to us I had to leave. I believe he was the owner. Coming from the service industry I expect decent service but if you're going to yell at your customers when they ask a simple question if their food is mild, you can count me out."}
{"text":"Rapid take out. Well packaged and freshly prepared. The hot and sour soup was spectacular and the sweet chilli sauce is worth a mention as well. Coupons are available locally. Service was friendly. For those eating in, the interior is small but clean and well appointed."}
{"text":"Order delivery $33.00 Food had no taste, tofu hard, sweet nd sour chicken taste less Quoted 45 min delivery I called in hour told would be there any second NOT I called back in 15 min. Wouldn't answer my call 3x' 30 minutes later food arrived.  1 hour and 30 minutes I'm live 2 minutes from them. Poor service poor blan food and was Luke warm ."}
{"text":"If there was 0 stars i would give this place that. food and service here is so terrible. the chef whoever she or he is needs to go back to a culinary institution to relearn how to be a chef. the food was so salty. we had the shrimp fried rice, chicken pad Thai, crying tiger and chicken curry. the curry was the most Salty of them. cant even eat it. we came to vegas and it was so disappointing. Even food at the Strip and i paid lots of money was terrible. that why i went on groupon to give the locals a try. i ended up with a terrible stomach ache. my overall suggestion is stay clear of this place! Service was so slow and there is an old lady trying to help them she doesn't understand english either so asking for napkin or anything should she would go back and another lady would translate for her so it took even longer. this was Thursday, today and lunch time and lots of people waiting for their to go orders and check.  people in Vegas lack flavors. Im so glad I'll back to OC as the food there is excellent and better service than vegas"}
{"text":"Should've checked out reviews before coming here. Don't want to take too many points off because the server was so nice. Went there for the \"lunch special\" boy oh boy did i get a \"special\" all right..My issue with this place is that there was a long strand of hair in my food, my egg roll to be exact. Lost my appetite immediately. Brought it to the attention of the Asian Lady with a mullet. She took a look at it, took just the egg roll and came back with a new one. Um...why would I want to eat another???? and then in the end they didn't even compensate me! what no discount? comped meal??? Manager was not there, so i called at 5pm when I was told that they would be. She wasn't apologetic, in fact she made excuses saying \"well thats the restaurant business\" and \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" I was appalled that she would come off so defensive and rude... I told her I wanted to be compensated. She snapped at me saying, \"just come back and we'll give you a free meal okay?!\" yeah, sure i'll come back. There's a ton of Thai places in Vegas, I advise you NOT go to this one."}
{"text":"Extremely fresh Chinese food , tasty and affordable . One of the best I've tried in a while and gives you a free drink for rating it on yelp! I recommend shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"Went here last night the food is excellent. Great introduction to Thai food.  I had the chicken pepper steak and the papaya salad.  Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"I just went in to The King and I for the first time. I was greeted by a very pleasant lady who helped me with my to go order. I ordered panang curry and it was made very quickly. I got it home and oh my !  This is the best panang curry I have ever tasted, and I have been around. I will be back in, in no time. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing Service! Large portions! I defiantly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  I'm kind of surprised I didn't check it out sooner!  The inside was a lot nicer than I expected, it reminded me of a jungle, but in a good way! I came during their lunch hour so I order a lunch special. I'm partial towards panang curry so I had to order it lol. Their lunch comes with soup,  salad, rice, and main entrée. The soup was simple chicken and rice dish, nothing to write home about, but still good. The salad was simple as well, lettuce and carrots and really great vinaigrette!  The panang curry was really good. It was more peanuty than what I was used too, but it wasn't overwhelming, I really enjoyed it.  I got the pork and my friend got the chicken and both meats were tender and not over cooked. They gave a really good amount of rice as well.... no stingy portions here! Oh yea you also get a spring roll with lunch,  those were tasty....I almost bought a full order of them lol."}
{"text":"What a find! I thought this place was going to be a dive from the looks of the complex, but it really is a diamon in the rough. The food was affordable, fresh and seasoned well and the service was good too. I DEFINITELY plan to come back. Wish I had found this place sooner."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by all the reviews about the bad service! I've never, ever had a bad experience and I've been going to the restaurant and also ordering delivery for at least 5 years. I think it's one of the best Thai places I've been to in Vegas, with consistently good food, decent prices, and a friendly owner. It could just be my family's imagination, but I think take-out also has bigger portions (hint hint).  I think the only thing is that every once in a while you get a little less than what's normally expected, but that's not common at all. Like I said, consistently good food, at least for 90% of the time I've had the food here.  I like to get the catfish and the King and I fried rice, and just put some prik nam plaa on it. Hooray for prik nam plaa! I really like the chilies that they offer here, some Thai places don't serve all of the different chilies that they do here."}
{"text":"This place is decorated very cool do not let the outside appearance disincourage you from coming in. They have good food, our favorite was their special fried rice and the beef penang curry is delicious. They have coconuts so good and fresh, only complaint was the only waitress was with boyfriend and I know we could of been attended more adequate but nothing alse . Price wise is very affordable less than $12 per dish."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night and we were the only ones! probably because it was rather late.  The service was good.  We had Singapore noodles and BBQ chicken... they were both delicious!!! reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  We'll totally go back... probably get delivery though."}
{"text":"Love their yellow curry. Crab Rangoon and most of their food. They are pretty quick and always friendly"}
{"text":"10/10 best Thai food in Vegas. I've been going here my entire life (21 years) and it's never ever failed me. Linda the owner is such a sweet lady and remembers me and my mom from all of these years going there and getting takeout too. The pad Thai, chicken satay, chicken salad, beef salad, red curry, chicken with vegetables, almond chicken, tom yum soup, and even the vegetarian curry is all so delicious. Dine in service is always friendly and the food comes out SO quickly (and fresh) because the chefs know exactly what they're doing and do it well. I've tried other Thai places in town and none compare. King & I is tried and true - the best."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas and have tried 3 Thai places around this area and this one beats them all.   The quality is great, portions are great, and prices are great. Service and atmosphere is also great.  This is my new go-to Thai place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I somehow was able to finally pull myself away from the best Thai restaurant in Vegas (just down the street from K&I) to try the King!  Located in a nice neighborhood, although somewhat hidden, this place has a really cool atmosphere and friendly service.  Trendy music playing, it's a very inviting and \"warm\" place to eat!  I ordered the Thai beef jerky and one of the specials, salmon curry.  The Thai jerky was pretty good.  It came with a sauce that looked much more exotic than it tasted.  The sauce was rather bland.  That was ok though because the jerky itself had a nice roasted flavor.  It wasn't too chewy either!    The salmon with curry was a slight disappointment for me.  I ordered it a 4/4 on the heat level, and it came out rather mild.  The taste of the curry, which was a panang style curry with moderate thickness to it, was rather bland.  A tad sweet, and thick, not offensive in any way, but bland.  The salmon was a nice big portion for $16, and tasted pretty good although a touch dry.  It came with American broccoli, which usually pairs well with this style of curry.  That was probably my favorite part of the meal.  They also give you a big portion of rice, so sharing would be an easy thing to do here.  Overall, this Thai restaurant is a good one if you don't like your Thai food too spicy or too flavorful.  For me though, I am not sure I can find a reason to go back."}
{"text":"So many spices, so little time. The vivid flavors of King and I had my fork working overtime, refusing to call it a day.  Whats great about this establishment is the authenticity encapsulated inside a colorful but anassuming dining room tucked warmly inside the Lakes Area of Vegas west. The ambiance is anything but Sin City, and those fortunate to journey to this gem of southeast asian cuisine will be rewarded.  Pad Thai. A must for any first venture to Thai dining, and theirs did not dissapoint. Every bit of peanuty fish sauce goodness married beautifully to noodles.  The Beef Salad and Spicy Chicken Larb were also aromatic highlights, cooked so fresh and yet so light as to not induce any food coma. Health conscious diners can dig these dishes almost guilt free.  Linda the owner and Jan-O our server were delightful hosts. We look forward to discovering what else they have cooking!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a number of times.... I've even eaten in the restaurant... Portion size has gotten a lot smaller (combination pad thai)   Kung Pao chicken not worth the order....  Red curry amazing BUT I added a few extras when I brought it home.... Won't be ordering from here again anytime soon..... looking for other Thai restaurants in the valley...."}
{"text":"The lady working at the cash register is totally clueless. She kept running my credit card as debit and it kept getting denied. This happened for about 15 minutes till finally I told her to run my credit card as credit and the transaction finally went through. She had an idiocracy moment.   Their roast duck wasn't bad. The portion was tiny. They can make up from the bad service by at least having better portions."}
{"text":"This is a well kept secret at the Lakes, and I love coming here for a quick lunch! The tofu curry is wonderful! The staff are really sweet and attentive!"}
{"text":"I had Singapore noodles, not spicy, and it was tasty but not amazing.  HOWEVER, I woke up in pain at 2:00  AM and spent the rest of the night sleepless, getting dinner out of my body.  So minus 4 stars for making me sick."}
{"text":"This is across from UNLV, where I go to. I ordered the Soft Shell Crab with House Curry Sauce. It's really good. They deep fried the crab to deliciousness and the curry sauce is full of flavor. Their servers Eve and Nui are friendly as well and the decor inside are traditionally Thai-themed. This is a very authentic Thai restaurant. You feel like you are actually dining in Thailand."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I have been to King and I on only a few occasions.  Where I would give their food a 3/4 stars, the ambiance, courtesy and promptness of service pushes it to 4.  Our beef satay was a bit dry but my mint chicken was excellent.  My eating companion opted for fried rice, which was moist and full of flavor.  We both ordered one point under the spiciest of choices and could have easily gone that extra point.  The lunch specials, as noted in other reviews, is a solid option."}
{"text":"Really delicious pad thai. Best Tom Yumm soup we've had. We made the right choice by choosing this restaurant for Thai. First time here, but won't be the last! Portion size is awesome as well."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is always good. This is my favorite Thai restaurant.  I recommend the Thai beef salad, chicken satay and Singapore noodles."}
{"text":"Quick service, nice staff, and relatively good food. Pad Thai, Mongolian tofu and curry was delicious. I come here rather often for pick up and I intend to continue this tradition because it is awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The service was warm and inviting, and the food was cooked and flavored very well. The portion of chicken pad Thai will feed me for three days! Yay!"}
{"text":"This place long time located here and we are going to eat every once in a while. The owner is super nice and food need to be little extra flavor to be reach thai taste. May be this customers around the area might like the less spice of the thai food, as i am Sri Lankan, i use lots of hotness to my food. place is little cozy and clean. If you got the rush hours all the tables are full and need to long wait. I recommend this place if you like less spicy thai food to try...Specially the yellow curry and the combination fried rice is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I have known Linda the same amount of time I've lived on this side of town. The food is great and they treat you like family. The Tom yum is to die for. If you like Thai beef jerky this is the place to be. I'd say everything on the menu is a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I love their food and was a usual for a while. They always gave me a discount when I presented my coupon and told me to save it again for next time. This stopped happening and service got rude. Not sure what made the same staff have such a bad attitude change."}
{"text":"I just ordered deliver from this place and the shrimp pad Thai was burned. Seems like the quality control at this place is off."}
{"text":"I know they do a lot of take out but really.  Tables are sticky, food just sitting out in the open.   Food is just bland."}
{"text":"I love this Thai food!!! It's very authentic and always fresh.  Every dish I've ordered from the Pad Thai to Massaman Curry, has been delicious.  I also recommend dining in to get the full experience.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  Every dining experience I have had at King and I has been top notch.  Five stars all the way! If yelp had more I'd give it 100!"}
{"text":"Hey its another Thai joint. Its good. I wouldn't ever go back. No real reason just a lot of other guys around town do it better. If your near it and want Thai give it a try. But if you see some my other reviews there is better options."}
{"text":"A few concerns about this place after eating here several times:  Food is inconsistent, ranging from average to poor.  Usually get the Pad Thai with Chicken, quality has dropped over time.  Chicken has become rubbery and unsavory, color of noodles have gotten strangely more orange over time - an unnatural color that looks more like food coloring than any kind of legitimate ingredient in the dish.  I have always had the feeling that this place in not terribly clean (sticky tables, rattan placemats that appear to never really be cleaned) and it has just gotten worse over time.  Service is very inconsistent - in the same party, arrival of entrees can be staggered by 20-30 min over lunch - not workable when out for lunch with a group during a work lunch hour.  Many other good thai places existing in Las Vegas - in my opinion, this one is not among them, and one should look to other options for thai food."}
{"text":"Great thai food in the LV suburbs! Coming from LA, I was skeptical coming into it, and was pleasantly surprised! There's a good mix of authentic Thai dishes and more westernized dishes as well.  Service is great and Linda (I believe she is the owner) is incredibly nice. She made sure we had a good experience."}
{"text":"Terrible. I got the pad see ew and it was so greasy, beef was dry and they used the wrong broccoli. The portion was a decent size. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I got the Pad Thai lunch special. It comes with soup, an egg roll, some wonton chips, and a soda. The price was good, but the food was not. The Pad Thai tasted funny. There was some weird after taste; I couldn't figure it out. There were no extra napkins so I had to grab one off the neighboring table. I also ordered the Thai Iced Coffee and it was very sweet. I have this place two stars because of the price. Maybe something else on the menu would taste better, but I'm not willing to try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"No doubt, it beats a burger!    I frequent this place for the lunch special ($6 for main dish, egg roll, salad, and soup - the drink is now separate) and for that price it is so worth it!  They do seem to do the heat level \"American style\" (that is, a 2 out of 5 won't kill the sensitive palettes like at some joints that may be more authentic).  My experiences with the curries are that they are quite flavorful, and they come with an assortment of veggies mixed in with the meat which I appreciate.  I've never had the pad Thai that several folks complained about, so it sounds like the curries are the way to go.  I'll stick with my standard.  Their panang curry is a bit too peanutty for me, the yellow a bit too mellow, but the red curry is just right blend of flavor and heat to brighten my day.  service is generally quick and polite, and lunch size servings are generous (you won't leave hungry).  I would kill for the tom kha soup when I'm in the mood (not on the lunch special, but sometimes you need to deviate for a craving).    No, it's not the most unique or amazing Thai in town, but for a tasty sit-down lunch stop, it's my standard and it definitely beats most of the Thai-Chinese catch-all competitors."}
{"text":"Talk about codial employees and amazing food! They have such an awesome menu and so many spices! They have an awesome selection of drinks to choose from. The Thai tea is spot on! It's a small place and great for parties of 2-4. There are allot of Thai places around this area but this one beats them all!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the restaurant was empty, which is great for me because it means my food should come out more quickly. It made me question how good the food would be though.   I walked up to the counter to grab a menu since no one came to seat me. The waitress was on the phone taking another order but she took the time to put the caller on hold and point at a table for me to sit at and to yell to the waiter in the back to help me. No one has put a caller on hold to tend to a guest who's standing there in person! Star 1, earned. I ordered the pad kra pow lunch. The soup came within a minute of ordering and the rest a few minutes later. Star 2, earned.   The waitress brought me all of the spice trays without me asking for it too, making my meal look like a grand feast. This is pretty rare for Thai restaurants if the spice tray isn't already on the table. Star 3, earned.  The food was a bit oily, but that's how I like it, so star 4 earned."}
{"text":"If you're craving Panang Curry, King & I is where it's at!!.... Every dish is exquisite!! I absolutely love the late hours as well...Open till 10pm!!    Probably the BEST Thai food in Végas... my happy place!"}
{"text":"Do Not Come Here.The Food Is Nasty.The Lunch Menu Doesnt Specify  That It is Only During The Week,If You Buy The Groupon You CANNOT Use It For The Lunch Special Even Though It Doesnt State That ANYWHERE.So Beware Of That If You Are Crazy Enough To Come Here.The Pad Thai Tastes Like Sugar,The Waitress Was Dressed In Sweatpants And A T-Shirt,Unprofessional.I Cant Believe We Wasted Our Money.Mcdonalds Has Better Food. Krung Siam Is A Much Better Thai Restaurant,The Service Is Good And The Food Is Stellar.  I Attched A Picture Of My Food AFTER I Finished Eating.It Was So Sweet And Disgusting That I Couldnt Eat It."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood Thai restaurant! We've had their food delivered for years and it's always hot, prompt and delicious! We recently ate at their location in the Lakes and it was lovely! Linda the owner is quite a character (in a good way) which made dining there all the more fun. If you like Thai food you can't go wrong with the King and I!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken satay...really good. Chicken panang curry was decent, but really soupy. I've had better."}
{"text":"This is by far the very best Thai restaurant in a Vegas!  And the price is a fantastic value!  Linda the owner came by and checked on us too which was a nice touch.  I highly recommend this place, would give it six stars if I could...."}
{"text":"Love king & I! We love Thai food and family businesses and this place is both. Linda the owner is so amazing. She will remember not only you and your family, but your favorite dish, and exactly how you like it. The food is amazing here, but the service and the cozy ambience are what brings us back. It's a super small space so I do mean cozy, but in the best way. Brandon is always our server and is so friendly and polite! I've had takeout a few times and he will walk it out to my car.  Our favorite dishes are the panang curry, red curry, pad Thai, and kung pao chicken. They have different spices on the table to add to your meal and Linda always has the best recommendations for what will be best. If you haven't been here, definitely stop in for great food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this place but the last couple of times I've been here I've gotten extremely sick! All I ever order is vegatable tofu pad thai and spring rolls so for me to get so sick multiple times makes me worried about why I'm getting sick. Bad food handling or rotten ingredients? I'm not sure but I definitely don't trust it anymore. Too bad, I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Very cute and quaint place. Well decorated. They really give good value for the cost. We ordered spicy eggplant and pad sew ew. They gave so much beef! Yum. Great service too!"}
{"text":"First time I ate here I was impressed. Food tastes fresh and very flavorful. I would definitely order from here again. Even after it being a delivery food still was hot and felt like it was fresh off the oven"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and they were really quick.  Their prices were decent and I really love their spices.  They were perfect."}
{"text":"So I've been here a total of two times . And first impression was eh small business trying to make it maybe ill give it a shot help the people out. Sure why not I'm all for that . However first time I came they were rude, but the amount of food was good for the price.   It's located in the Vons center right across the street from unlv , so it's pretty convenient considering I spend most of my time at school. The lunch specials are good, however service is extremely slow.  Decorations are nice however I don't think I will comeback due to the horrible service despite the large amount of food and convenience ."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE Found hair in our pad Thai dishes not one but two strands. Yuck!!!! and this place has a B rating so that explains it!! And the owner with the funny pikachu hair cut is rude and nasty.  We will never eat here again!  What a disgust."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Tropicana, you'd hope that you've found some kind of local gem when you walk into the restaurant.  The inside is quite cute. There is a stone facade on all the walls so you feel like you're dining in a cave. I was brought here under the pretense that the food here is as good as Lotus of Siam.  Um.  WRONG.  I ordered the crispy duck and it was soooooo freakin' dry. The flavor was there... but it'd be like ordering a succulent roast duck in the window of your favorite chinese restaurant- and then leaving outside in the sun for 2 days, then serving it on a plate here at this restaurant.  We also ordered a chicken dish with a coconut curry. The sauce was good, but again... the chicken was over cooked and dry! That's AFTER having been smothered in sauce! Good god!  My waitress didn't understand my question when I asked her to \"please describe the crispy duck to me?\" Well... actually, she understood me but she was so sincere and smiled, \"it's a duck. It's crispy. It has a sauce on the side.\"  \"What's the sauce made of?' \"Um. It's brown or... no, black. And it's um.... um.... people like it!\"  Sigh. I wish I hadn't ordered it. The staff seems nice, but they're not trained in the menu and they're really just glorified bussers  I hear the coconut soup here is good. I'm not sure I'll ever get back here to try it though.  The good points of this place is that management seemed nice and the decor inside is quirky. ."}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food. Lunch specials at a good rate with a filling proportion.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I love this little place! I have been going here for 5 years now and I have never been disappointed. I typically go for their lunch specials, ordering the Pad Thai with beef....delicious! The soup they bring out is very good and varies on the day. My favorite is the egg drop but they are all yummy. The staff is friendly, they don't talk much but are attentive. If you are in the mood for something sweet I recommend the Thai tea.....soooooo gooood!"}
{"text":"There service is amazing the food is to die for and it's priced very reasonably I love that it sits right by the lake and the staff treats you like family I would highly recommend eating here, this is my dad's favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas and meeting here for lunch today!"}
{"text":"I thought it was impossible to make bland Thai food, but King & I has succeeded. We had 3 different entrees - Pad Thai w/chicken, Kung Pow chicken, & Shrimp Pad Hot Chili Pepper. All of them were bland and very greasy. The chicken in both dishes was overcooked, but the shrimp was cooked nicely. The only good thing we ordered was the Tom Yum Goong soup. It was flavorful and had a generous portion of shrimp.  We won't be back - there are too many better Thai places in town. I wouldn't recommend King & I."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. I ordered from them all the time. The food is always fresh and so good. Love this place."}
{"text":"The decor and name didn't say Thai. The faux stone walls is a little crazy. Definitely takes away from the ambience. The gem of this place is the food.   We started of with thai pork jerky. It was delicious paired with the waterfall dipping sauce but lacked the sticky rice which is normally paired with this appetizer. I had their traditional pad Thai. It was delicious and a slight spice. As we know i love spice. Chicken Tom Ka was so delicious especially most places have a hard time balancing the lemon grass I the dish but was a nice balance.   All in all, food great but the decor needs changing. I give a 3.5."}
{"text":"Our first visit (maybe 8 months ago?) was GREAT! This is our second visit and IT SUCKED! It's Memorial Weekend, nobody else was dining in... so NO REASON FOR THE COMPLETE SHIT SHOW OF THIS VISIT. We ordered the Wings, the shower up with cold centers. We both ordered the same meal, mine was chicken and his was Pork... his appeared first- NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT HE ORDERED. We compared when mine arrived. The server gave attitude and told my husband he didn't order the same.. he took the order back and brought out the \"correct order\" which turned out to be chicken and NOT pork as ordered. We decided to just stick with it, until half way down and my husband has a giant black hair connected into the noodle and his mouth. Seriously?! Gross....  Giving 2 stars because the first visit we had no issues and enjoyed the meal and experience. And also a 2 star because after I took my husbands plate to the cashier and he seen the hair, and I told him about the cold center in the winds he was gracious enough to void the entire bill. Never going back... the worse experience. I wish I would have taken a picture before I took the bowl up and they took it away. I wonder if Darcy Spears has been here?"}
{"text":"wish I didn't I live on the other side of town, This place is Delicious, every time I can I go here the large portions, and the great pricing, not to mention the staff is super friendly I see regulars come in every time I go. Best thai food in vegas, hands down."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood thai restaurant.  Not the easiest to find, but the quality is good, quick service, and plenty of delivery or takeout options for some good food on the move.  Prices are similar to any other restaurant of this variety with most meals in the $9-11 range. The only complaint is the spicyness level doesn't match other competitors.  Other than that, King & I is a very good option for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place a few years ago and was impressed from day one. I went back recently to meet up with some buddies I used to frequently dine with. When settling on a location, it was easy when one of them said \"how about the thai place near Sahara and Durango.\" Four of us bellied up for lunch, each ordering a different selection from their lunch specials. The lunch special comes with an entree, rice, soup, egg roll and a drink all for $7.95. I got the Sweet and Sour Pork, as I usually do. It is some of the best in town. The others got the Pad Thai, Kung Pow and Chow Mein. They all looked delicious and the four of us left satified. We arrived just after they opened, so there was no crowd at all. It got a little busier as our lunch gathering went on. The staff was friendly and the service was prompt, never letting the berverages run empty. The King and I is hard to beat for the quality, service and price. A sit down lunch for four, including tip, for around $40. I will definitely return and highly recommend it, if you are ever in the area of The Lakes."}
{"text":"This little place is incredible.  Keep in mind that my tastebuds are in perfect working order. I realize that some people have given this place a low rank because of perceived poor service. I, however, am not a drill sergeant and I do not demand my food within 5 minutes. This is not Panda Express, guys.  I order to go or sit in, either way it's awesome.  I love the vegetarian options. I order 3 main entrees for $24 (not including tip) and enjoy the shite out of myself. The pad thai, veggie curry, and one other vegetarian noodle dish are my favorite. Their spring rolls are also great.  Overall, great food, great price, fresh, and good service."}
{"text":"Quite tasty. The massaman curry was thick and delicious, very peanuty. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"I have no ideea why this place has bad reviews. We've been eating there for a long time and every time are greated with smiles and a great attitude! The food is delicious and i have NEVER had a single complaint!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident. A group of four of us were looking for a pizza place, got there and the pizza place was take out only. The King and I was in the same plaza, we were starving, and now here we are. The inside is small but welcoming and the server was very good. The food did not take long to come out. All of the appetizers we ordered were delicious. The spicy Pad Thai was excellent. So was the Mongolian beef. The seafood/combination fried rice plates were just okay. Portions are substantial. Very glad we ended up here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I am a huge Thai lover. I mostly go to Archis but I must say King & I is my new go to for several important reasons. For starters the portions seem to be larger and they don't nickel and dime. A large side of rice has come with everything I have ever ordered even when the meal doesn't necessarily call for rice (soups, salads). I think their Thai beef salad is better than most I have tried and they deliver which is great! Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered for delivery, the hostess who took my order was very personable and sweet. Unfortunately so was the pad Thai. That nutty and spicy flavor I had been craving wasn't there, instead a sweetness that was overwhelming and a huge turn off. Delivery was super fast, albeit the driver called me to come get the food downstairs of my apartment complex. While I understand safety is a priority, I've lived here two years with no one ever making that request. It was odd. I will try it one more time, maybe the curry will be better?"}
{"text":"Service is great! Nice quiet place for an intimate dinner! Food is great, fast, and reaaonably priced! Love their thai iced tea!!"}
{"text":"(**update May 2016 -- Under new management, yet AGAIN. Be warned: Spiciness scale 2 out of 5 is incredibly spicy. My review below is for the previous management, not the current.**)  Imagine a small ski lodge or cabin. Now add some Thai trimmings. Okay, now wedge it between a mobile store and a laundromat and there you have the King & I, in the University Plaza (same as Vons). Whowuddathunk this place would have such a nice interior, considering its slightly seedy location? Probably just the college kids.   Whenever the bf and I have a hankering for Thai food around campus and don't feel like driving very far, we like to stop in here. It's been recently overtaken by new management, which has both its pros and cons --  Pros: perceptibly friendlier staff, new plateware and mason jars, cracks finally sealed up in the stone paneling so that bugs won't come out to play unexpectedly.  Cons: somewhat smaller portions, food's pretty average, no more 10% student discounts (but you do get a free drink if you check into Yelp per their table signs)  Our most recent dinner visit, we ordered the chicken yellow curry with two sides of rice. Our waitress informed us that rice was already included and that she'd happily refill for us. When it came out, she gave us a big bowl so that was nice. If you're on a tight budget, but still want to go out for hole-in-the-wall Thai food without sacrificing ambiance, King & I definitely delivers. Three and a half stars!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. I had the pad Thai with tofu and Panang with shrimp. I asked for a 3 out of 4 spice, but it wasn't spicy at all, so I had to eat it with jalapeños. Overall, the pad Thai was good, but not great. I feel like it wasn't as flavorful as other places. It lacked the sweet peanut taste that I like so much. The Panang was delicious. The shrimp was a fair size which I was impressed about. The portions are the same as other places, but I don't think I'll be driving all the way here for it. It didn't have the glitter/spazz effect on me to crave for it. The Thai tea was okay for 3.00 bucks.   The service is okay. The lady is very nice, but never really came back to check up on us. At one point she disappeared for awhile. The parking lot is ghetto and some shady people around too. I locked my doors when I was in my car. Haha"}
{"text":"This place is so small but should be so much bigger! This was my first time trying Thai food and the waitress was amazing! Helped us in the right direction! I highly recommend the yellow curry dish. I will definitely return here"}
{"text":"This place was crap! The food was so gross, if you like Archis Thai then you will hate this place. Tasted like ass. And the guy working there was so rude. No one was in the restaurant at all(literally not a single person) I was ignored standing at the counter, then when I tried to tell him we placed an order online and I was here to pick up, he rudely cut me off and told me to wait, like my mere presence was disrupting him. If he was busy, there's a nice way to ask people to wait. Or have any of the other employees help because there were no other customers. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The garlic soft shell crab is very tasty and flavorful. The native beef curry though it is spicy, it is delectable. The ambiance inside the resto is conducive and the staff are friendly. Ngui and Eve."}
{"text":"Super gross Thai food I've had the real thing so this isn't cutting it at all and my biggest fault was ordering delivery instead of just going in but I don't think even ordering at the restaurant would change the quality of their food, the curry was eatable I at least tried it but the pad Thai they sent me was a different color than any pad Thai I've ever saw it was literally like a pale pink as if it had been re heated over and over and the one bite I took was just disgusting I'm from Seattle so my expectation for Thai food are at a 10 and I have yet to find a place in Vegas I like I've found some that are eatable but this is by far the worst I've tried and has literally turned me off from trying again shame on you guys for selling that ;("}
{"text":"Food was a ONE star. Reason why they get A star was because lunch special was pretty cheap and they had a jar of pink starbursts by the cashier! (LOVE STARBURSTS)  However.....  I cannot remember anything more past the pubic hair in my coworkers food.  The End."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in town. Ambience and decor is nice and the food is excellent. If you like coconut, their coconut smoothie is basically a real coconut, sweetened and blended, and it's the best I've ever had in my life.  I had the lunch special Panang Curry and it was delicious. It also came with a small soup, salad, and egg roll."}
{"text":"Very delicious food!  Very flavorful and plentiful portions!  Very close to UNLV!  Convenient spot for lunch and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Friendly service very tasty food. Authentic flavors good size portions and nice small place. Not expensive."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly staff. Recommend the soft sell carb, thai honey ribs is amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great location, with more than adequate food. The reason for the low rating is, I got sick after eating what appeared to have been undercooked shrimp in a Spring Roll from here. I think they might need to clean up their kitchen a bit.  Also, the restaurant, while intimate and romantic for a first date, is a bit crowded and uncomfortable for anything else.  This is not a bad place, and it has its fans, but I would not say that you should travel from across town to come here, as some might have done before. Especially not now where there are so many ethnic restaurants to choose from, including Thai, all across the Valley."}
{"text":"It's not to die for but it IS close and gets the job done. For some reason, I sometimes crave their chow noodles.   Portions are large, one order can easily be good for 2-3. Prices do go up, however and the owner will Never give you anything for free (white rice) even if you've been a regular for years."}
{"text":"King & I is a little restaurant surrounded by houses hidden in the community known as \"The Lakes\" that resides next to an artificial (very) blue lake. Perhaps like in a rural area of old Thailand, but instead hidden in a jungle and residing next to a real lake. Would be nice I imagine to be served Thai tea and just sit there enjoying the scenic view of the lake, but for me when I taste a Thai restaurant's thai tea it sets my mentality of the. For King & I was \"meeeeeeh\" because of the overly sweetness and a mild tea essence.   King & I delivers, which is a huge factor in why I consume their productions even though the food is \"meeeeeeeeeh\". The consumption of their food takes place during my work days where I usually do not have much time to take a breather and taking a thirty may result in chaos possessing my work place. Godsend that they are delivering from their work approved yummies from a location fairly close. Most importantly delivery is decent, usually 20-25 minutes, which might break down into 15 minutes to cook and prepare for delivery then another 10 minute drive.  They have an excellent value lunch menu, but is limited to a daily special if you're ordering on a Monday to Friday. On the weekends though you can choose any of the lunch specials. The lunch specials are usually consisted of a fruit salad with a mild salty dressing, a scoop of fried rice, \"insert lunch item\", and a (20oz?) fountain drink. For the most part I order the chicken pad thai because I enjoy noodles, although when its to go the noodles are usually bundled together because of its time in the styrofoam container. The pad thai always seems to be a bit sweet to me though, even with an increase in spice level, I can still taste a sweetness.   I've had a few of the curries (panang and yellow curry) here during my off days, and for the most part, they are a bit sweet for me, but smell great.   The service here is friendly, but sometimes when I order over the phone there is a bit of the a language barrier, especially when I ask for recommendations.   Great for lunch, but during off times where time is not a limiting factor, I would try one of the many other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 11 years, essentially since I moved to Vegas. This is my \"go to\" spot for Thai food here locally.  The owner is such a wonderful lady. Whenever I catch her, she always remembers me and gives me a hug. She knows me because I'm the one who always orders the combination fried rice, thai style, with no onions lol.  Service is awesome. They are quick, friendly and provide generous portions. Food is superb. I've taken many dates here over the years and both my dates and I have been thoroughly satisfied.   If you are looking for good Thai food in Vegas, this is THE spot, hands down!"}
{"text":"King and I is my absolute favorite spot. I order from here at least once a week with my boyfriend. Their tofu soup, panang, yellow curry, and spring rolls are to die for. The service is always great and they have never made a mistake on my order. Their delivery service is incredible and the food always arrives quickly.   I have yet to have a bad experience. I recommend this place to everyone who's looking for good quality food for a great price."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years because it's so close to UNLV and I love it. The management seems to have changed at some point because the menu is different and the daily soup is a lot better now. I'm a fan and will always eat here when I'm near the university."}
{"text":"Vegas has this weird asian thing going on. It looks as if almost every thai restaurant offers Chinese style food. I am a food purist and find it somewhat crazy and bewildering that you can get pad see ew and sweet and sour chicken at the same place....end of rant.  The king and I delivers.....I like that when I am lazy. Is their food amazing no:...especially compared to Thai restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, or Seattle."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate a zero! Horrible customer service!! The lady who took my order was wrong and she would not own up to it, I asked her to change it and she yelled that she did not misunderstand me that it's my fault, never has anyone been so rude in the customer service, never going to order from here again, and I suggest you don't either!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is relatively small, but the food was delicious, the service was excellent, the portions were generous and relatively inexpensive.  My family enjoyed lunch there and will return. I lived in Thailand for several years and the food in the restaurant was as good as anything I enjoyed in Thailand."}
{"text":"I used to order from here all the time, but it has been a while. I decided to order delivery a couple nights ago through eat24. I ordered spring rolls, Mongolian beef, and chow mein. I have ordered all of these items before and never had any issues. However, this last experience makes me never want to order from here again. My spring rolls were burnt, the Mongolian beef juices leaked out of the container all over the bag so the meat that was already dry had no type of juice to help it out, and the chow mein had a load of seasonings just dumped on top that would not incorporate into the noodles even though I tried stirring it. I ate what I could, which wasn't much and threw the rest out because I just could eat it. Because I was so frustrated with spending $30 on food I couldn't eat, I didn't think to take a photo of it. Because of that, I was told there was nothing that could be done. I tried calling the restaurant but they didn't answer the phone probably because my food was delivered right before they closed. I tried to address the matter the next day with eat24 but they said nothing could be done as well. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"6/3/2017  I purchased a Groupon Coupon for King & I at the Tropicana location.  I ordered the Kung Pow Shrimp (their spelling) and an order of Crab Rangoon.  They only had canned soda so I settled with the water.  I ordered 5 in Spicy.  The food was good.  When I went to pay with my Groupon Coupon, the waitress said she couldn't except it because it stated it was for 2 people and I was by myself.  I said I'm single and eat using the Groupon at other establishments and I've never had a problem.  She said she would NOT honor the coupon.   I said in that case, I had no need for the coupon because I would not be returning due their policy.  She said she didn't care, she was not going to honor the coupon, that I should have said something before I ordered.  I stated that I didn't know it was a problem as I had never had a problem before and being single, I eat alone often.  I felt that the policy was unfair and said due to their policy, I again had no use for future use of the coupon at that location because I would not return and would take my business elsewhere.  I said if there had to be two people eating for the coupon to be honored, I'd see if someone wanted some of my Crab Rangoon. She  said she would except the coupon.  The food was okay, it was spicy as I ordered but because of their policy, I will not return."}
{"text":"The food was great from what may have been an authentic Thai family. It would have got a five star however it is in a really bad neighborhood and just slightly priced above what I think a quality food restaurant in a bad neighborhood should be priced. It is priced just about right if you have a Groupon; if this restaurant were in town square or downtown summerlin the prices could easily be twice as much !"}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas this was one of my favorite stops. This Thai restaurant is right across the street from UNLV and used to be one of the best Thai places in the city.   Now it is just plain sad. The food is tasteless and bland, the pan nang just tasted like peanut sauce. I think the tofu was added in last as it had absorbed nothing.  They still get an extra star for good service and food presentation, but sadly this is a restaurant I won't be frequenting anymore."}
{"text":"Sucks and is extremely over priced felt rushed the whole time one of the owners are constantly mad or upset never going back again and neither should you complete waste of time and money"}
{"text":"maaaaan i don't know why people are so bummed on this place!  since i can't give half ratings i gave it a 4 when i really wanted to give it a 3.5.  the food was good, the service was very nice and friendly.  we had the tom yum soup and the pad sieu noodles.  not bad!    i feel like people might come here with hangovers and sassy attitudes and that's why the rating is so low..."}
{"text":"We went off the strip on our recent trip to try to find a Thai place b/c my friend was craving Thai food. We drove by this place and thought why not give it a try, worst Thai food I had in my entire life!!!!   The waitress was rude and dressed way too trashy. I ordered a lunch combo which included a 16oz coke, which they didn't bring to me. So when I asked the waitress about it, she said that I didn't order it then proceed to argue with me for 2 mins. Shit, I thought if it's part of the combo, you are suppose to bring me the drink!!! So if you don't ask for it, they won't bring it, what a scam to try to save money!!!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place via Groupon. Food was delicious! Try the Thai Iced Tea, super refreshing on a hot summer day in this heat"}
{"text":"Great food. Love their num tok beef salad. Nice and friendly people. Will def come back! A hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is small but neatly decorated. Our party of 4 was taken care of quickly and the appetizers were wonderful. We started with stuffed chicken wings crab ragoons a shrimp roll and one of the highlights the chicken larb salad. It was spicy and loaded with flavors. We ordered a variety of food including seafood fried rice and a beef dish. The real winner of the night was my spicy pad Thai. If I lived here I would surely be a regular in this restaurant. I would come back to here if I was back in Vegas even though it was a little bit out of the way. It is nearly 5 stars more like a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"So I was anxiously waiting for my hotel room to be ready, and I found this place out of no where on Tropicana located in a strip mall as I was cruising through Vegas.  I actually walked into the pizza joint next door on accident because the place is so well hidden. You really have to pay attention to the signs on the doors.   Once I got in, I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. It had a dark and relaxing feel to it with all the booths setup. They also had some nice authentic Thai decor hanging from the walls. I was quickly seated, and presented with the lunch special menu. Of course, I had to order the Chicken Pad Thai, and surprisingly they also had a Chinese menu was well. So I went ahead and ordered a Kung Pao Chicken.  The food arrived quickly and I did enjoy the taste of my pad thai. It had a good sweet taste to it, but the chicken was a bit on the dry end. I did like the egg roll with the sweet sauce as well. The rice had an original taste to it. It was like something you would get out of this country.  I also tasted the Kung Pao and I realized that it tasted exactly the same as the chicken on the Pad Thai. I am guessing they just prepare the chicken ahead of time and mix it whatever that is ordered.    My food wasn't spectacular, but I thought for the price it was a great deal. Two lunch combos came out to be about $15 without drinks. Definitely a good little surprise indeed.  Come here if you are not expecting too much, but a full stomach."}
{"text":"My mom was there for lunch with her friends one day. Was nice enough to call me to see if I wanted anything. I tried the Kung pao chicken lunch special. Wasn't too bad. A little different than Chinese Kung pao. I had no problem gobbling up the dish. The soup was basically water with a couple of veggies in it. Tasted it. Meh. My son ended up finishing. Now for the egg roll debacle. To all you las vegans reading this. You people are getting lied to! These things that they are passing off to everyone as egg rolls are not the real thing!!! The skin on the egg roll should be bubbly from being deep fried. A dark brown color. There should be some ground pork mixed in the middle as well. Next, everyone needs to learn what Duck Sauce is. Don't let the name of it fool you. It's great for real egg rolls and fried won-tons too!"}
{"text":"Delicious Tom yum soup. Pad Thai fine but not like I've had in Thailand or Okinawa (can you blame them)?  Be careful, the crab wontons are a meal themselves (albeit wonderful)!  Good prices and fast too."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving negative reviews but you need to know... the food was bland and overpriced, the rap music radio station was annoying and the seats in the booths are torn. I've eaten at dozens of much much better Thai restaurants all over Vegas, no reason whatsoever to come back here."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and my boyfriend had dined here before and insisted I try it! Wow!! What a gem! I had the chicken pad Thai and he had what he always has, the spicy catfish. The food was excellent !! Why we never found this place is beyond me but a definite return.. if you are looking for a great authentic Thai restaurant, this is it!"}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner and were pretty satisfied.  The restaurant is pretty small, so large groups may have a difficult time.  The service was a bit slow, and they brought our entries out at different times rather than appetizers, then main entrees.  But the food was excellent.  We had three appetizers: Chicken wings (which came with four huge pieces), crab ragoons (which were some of the best I ever had), and spring rolls (these were okay, but not the best).  My entrée was the red curry with beef, and it was amazing.  Our desserts (we had one of each), were just the perfect end to our meals.  My favorite was the sticky rice with mango.  And if you like smoothies with boba, definitely try the coconut or papaya.  If you're not in a rush and enjoy good Thai or Chinese food, I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I eat Thai on the weekly . How I never found this place sooner is beyond me. Hands down my favorite Thai food in town .  I  order Tom Kha Gai soup they bring it out  boiling with flames under it the whole time . Great soup to share with a friend . The flavoring is addicting . I could eat this soup everyday . I also am a huge fan of Thai Jerky. Again this is the best Thai jerky in town! And the dipping sauce for it is perfection. I have also tried the steak salad which is good and the beef larb which is also very good . This restaurant is a very humble quaint homey ma and pa type shop . I love these types of gems however if you're looking for something buji or upscale you may not love it . Also it sits on the lake in The Lakes. Very peaceful . I will attach pictures . Thank you again King and I. Oh and also the customer service here is through the roof amazing . I have had different servers when I've come , all of them are so sweet and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I order here at least once a week!  I recommend the pad see ewe, shrimp appetizer, wor wonton and the spring rolls.."}
{"text":"Every time we go there treated like family. This little joint is great food and good service always. Only the problem is the space you feel little cozy in there with few tables. If you go with big party, rush time is the worst and get full real quick. The location is great if they have little big space. All the soup are the best taste you get and combination fridrice is the bomb. Pineapple friedrice also my favorite."}
{"text":"I called another Thai place today for take out only to find out they now close on Tuesday.  I remembered the King and I had their menu stuffed in the doors of the neighborhood about a week ago.  OK, on with Plan B.  I got their Curry Duck and my wife got the Chicken with garlic and black pepper sauce.  She got 0 for spiciness.  I asked the order taker what their scale was.  It's a 1 to 4 so I ordered it at 4.  She confirmed I wanted extra spicy, and we had a short wait before I drove to The Lakes to get the food.  I loved my duck.  Superb!  She gave me two containers with extra spice, and I used some of that, too.  Their 4 isn't really a four.  It would be about a 6 on a 1 to 10 scale.  My wife wasn't as fond with her dish.  It had the dreaded cilantro that she dislikes, and she refuses to stop being a kid, grow up, and learn to eat various types of food.  Oh well, opposites attract.  I'm glad we had the Tuesday closing.  Now I have two dependable and very good Thai restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are very good! I would highly recommend the brown rice and yellow curry, which is very well made and prepared very quickly!"}
{"text":"New Management Rocks!  I am a huge fan of their Singapore Noodle and order it as often as I can. Prices are reasonable and food is delivered hot, not warm.   By far my favorite place for Thai food."}
{"text":"I always go lake Sahara location  This restaurant is more cute inside  And customer service was great but restroom was not clean. Food was just okay  I like Sahara location better"}
{"text":"It's next to city bank . Waitresses is by herself but she is kind friendly  we order lunch it's only $7.95 shp is $1 more ! Good price and good food ! Come with soup too ! The soup was very good ! Everything so tasty:) I things they mistake is I ordered steam tofu but they serve fried tofu . The lunch menu said its come with soda but she didn't offer so we got water :( i will visit again food is good size and good price even we didn't get soda :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Best in Vegas  the taste is the closest you can get other than being in Thailand."}
{"text":"Their southern Thai dishes are very authentic. Coming from Los Angeles where there are plenty of great Thai restaurants, this is way up there. I like my food spicy so their  jungle curry hits the spot. I've tried a different Thai restaurant each time I'm in town. This is the one that I will keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Real Thai food cooked by a real Thai. That pretty much sums up king and I. Well actually, the owner, Linda is the nicest person. She has so much love and pride in her restaurant, it really shows in her food. The taste is Unbelievable and so authentic. The restaurant is clean, food is fresh and comes out fast. If you want Thai food this is the place to go in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This King And I is located in The Lakes.  They have great lunch specials and their Red Curry and Panang Curry is out of this world tasty!  I eat here about once every two weeks and I am always happy that I went.  The lunch special is around $7.95 and there are Thai and Chinese items to choose from.  Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"This has become my go to Thai delivery since moving to this side of town.  They have me in the system and we usually order the same thing and recognize the address.    We get the   Tom Ka Gai with Chicken soup one of my mans favorite from travels over sea.  It is a coconut base creamy sour and spicy soup.  It has lots of mushrooms and lemon grass and thai chill.  It is dorm well to the standards of Thailand one of the reasons it is one of our favorites!   We get this one medium so I can eat it hot is very hot!   Panaeng Curry, he claims to have eaten this every day on his month stay he liked it so much!  The flavor here is really good!  It has a coconut, peanut flavor full of spices it has a heavy full flavor that rests on your tongue like a stew great on a cool day.    Other favorites are Pad Thai one of my favorites from Taihland I would go to the same street vendor every day for lunch he made the best pad thai,  This come to a close 3rd for me.  Very good and very large shrimp!   Pad Prik Khing Love the lingering lime taste after.  The Delivery is always fast always quicker then told and always hot and freshly made.  The delivery packaging is secure and never had leaks.  They always send a new menu which has a $5 off $20 or more so if I remember it makes a great discount!  My only complaint is they don't have Larb man I love larb..."}
{"text":"It's a small little place. With a cool view of the lake. The food here is good! It's pretty pricey. I got a salad and rice and it coast me about $16 and the guy who helped me out was  pretty rude. Wasn't the best costumer service. It is very authentic Thai food. Delicious, I only come here for the food."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time, and it's been about 3 years since I've had it..  Today I ordered it out of nostalgia and was really disappointed.  The delivery was fast, and the driver was really courteous.  The price was decent... affordable.  Unfortunately, this time the food was terrible.  I couldn't finish anything out of my lunch special (pad thai) with the exception of the egg roll which was only 'meh...' the rice was really bland and tasted funky.  I feel bad giving them only 3 stars, because my past experiences were all VERY good.  I will probably try it again, because i'm really hoping they were just having an off day."}
{"text":"great thai place. I've never been dissatisfied with their service while dining in or ordering taking/ picking up delivery.  Their thai iced tea is amazing; a matter or fact, all of their food has very intense flavors. Everything you could possibly want from a thai place and more. I've never gone to another thai place since i found this one :)"}
{"text":"Ok.  The pad thai is pretty good.  everything else is ok.  It is very close to where I live so, I plan on going back once a week.  Convenience means alot to me.  The people who work there are really nice and very accommodating to my \"needs\".    I didn't think to highly of their papaya salad.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here and the price is a little on the pricey side for a hole in the wall.    But, once again convenience is important that is until I try the other thai places in the area."}
{"text":"Prices jumped up a full dollar per item.  They messed up my order and instead of remaking it, I ended up getting a really odd tasting blend.  What was supposed to be pad kee Mao was pad see ewe flavored beef and broccoli with some of those things Singapore noodles mixed in with my pad kee Mao noodles and spices. It was really off.  The worst part is that when I got to the restaurant to pick up my order within the time frame I was told,  it wasn't ready.  The gal told me  that the cooks had my order wrong.... So they knowingly tried to salvage a dish they screwed up and tried to pass it off.   Boo.  I won't be returning.  There are three other Thai restaurants in the same area of town.  I think I'll be going to Lilly's instead."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. I saw 4 stars but didn't read the reviews before ordering. My shrimp pad thai was burnt. I could smell it as soon as I pulled it out of the bag, so the cook had to notice. Shrimp and eggs were black and it looks like the cook tried to hid the most burnt pieces on the bottom. So disappointed as I've been looking forward to trying this place out"}
{"text":"Love this place. They are prompt food is hot and just delicous. Plus they are right up the street. Love the duck. My only negative is the fact I can order maybe 4 things and my bill is usually 50.00 or more"}
{"text":"Cute little friendly place, wasn't expecting fancy food but wow I had the most amazing Panang ever! Way better than fancier bigger Thai restaurants I've been to. Seriously my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I love the king and I.  The food is great, but what really gets me is the service.  I don't have high hopes for neighborhood Asian restaurants, but this is something else.  Every time I go back, I am greeted by name, and asked if I would like my usual (having only been there less than 10 times).  The food is generous, and seafood is not overcooked.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Just in regards to ambiance, it's really cool with its stone walls and low level lighting.  It is also the best place around UNLV to get lunch, because they have inexpensive and generous lunch specials.  The food is great and the wait staff is usually pretty friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my wife and it was delicious. Sort of hard to find in the shopping center, but definitely worth a try. Service was great. Small sit down restaurant. We shared the Pad Thai and papaya salad. Came with white rice. Huge portions. Food was delivered pretty quick. I would recommend this place and I would definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I used to really like this restaurant located in a strip mall across from UNLV. It's a cute small hole in the wall with some sort of ambiance (tables & booth seating). My husband liked it and we even ate here with my family and friends. The service was excellent. The portions were good. The pricing was good. One lady was doing prep work (vegetables) at one of the dining tables, which was kind of weird. Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent. However, when we saw bugs the last time, we got a little turned off."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to rate it... Everything was so sweet. I love Pad Thai and there Pad Thai was just not doing it. For the price I paid for it was decent I guess I just thought it would be better because of all the good reviews I heard about it. I feel like I just had a sugar rush. And the waitress which I can't blame, was the only one there left our glass empty and did not even refill it. I couldn't drink the Thai tea anymore! It was sweet as well  The atmosphere and ambience was nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Somehow my wife agreed to try a Thai restaurant with me - a red letter day for sure. It just isn't her favorite food. I took advantage of the opportunity and we dined at the wonderful King And I. I had Steamed Mussel Soup and it definitely had a kick to it. Once I adjusted to the spicy heat I finished the whole dish with a big smile. My wife had the Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea. She shared with me and they were both very good. We took her leftovers to our hotel room and I'll have them for breakfast tomorrow! My lips were throbbing on the bus back to the hotel. That's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Average Thai food. Nothing to write home about. Lucki Thai was still several times better than this place.   I will drive a little further for better Thai food"}
{"text":"So we were in town for weekend.my husband saw the Groupon sale for this place and we decided to try it out.upon arrival, I inquired about check in offer from yelp.the waitress answered that they won't be able to offer because this business has new owner..I started to think how much money will u lose to offer the check in? If this is run by new owner,shouldn't they take out the offer from yelp because this will be false advertisement..but I let it go. Then we got our check.the price did not match with what they charged,so we asked..the answer? This was old menu,the price has been changed..really??? Now it has started to getting shady and I was getting annoyed.When my husband showed them the Groupon coupon we purchased,they said since we only have 3 people in the group,they cannot honor our purchase because it says has to be four or more people..Ummm..I really don't understand.how about we were supposed to meet one of our friends there and got cancelled?It was our money and it shouldn't be problem how we want to spend.The waiter assisted by calling the owner.but the owner said we need to call Groupon to clarify. Such BS..IF THAT WAS MY BUSSINESS, AS AN OWNER,I WOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE CUSTOMERS & OFFER IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO..NO WONDER THERE WERE NO CUSTOMERS EVEN ON WEEKENDS LUNCHTIME ADN KEEP IT UP THAT WAY..U WILL BE OUT OF BUSSINESS IN NO TIME"}
{"text":"Moving night celebration with Thai food pick up. We're in a New spot and must explore our Asian fair. I'm not giving this five stars because it's takeout. It may very well be worthy of such a rating when dining in.  Appetizers- fresh spring rolls...ehhh, I'm just not a fan. But the man seemed to like them.   Entrees- Panang Curry w chicken - super delicious; shrimp Pad Thai- for those of you who quest for the perfect pad thai this comes very close. The family was impressed. Thai beef salad- not too spicy!!!  Add ons- Brown rice, I think I found a new favorite. It seems like this was soaked or sprouted then steamed. Not a traditional brown rice that barely has the nutrient hulls scrubbed off. Cucumber salad- vegetable candy. ;)   They added in a variety of dipping sauces at least five different kinds, plus chili flakes and chili dipping sauce.   Totally hit the mark and refueled our tired muscles."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Thai food in Las Vegas! It's hard to pick just one as my favorite, but I think I'd have to go with the crab fried rice. The Thai iced tea is a favorite drink but alas, delicious drinks go straight to my belly.  The lunch specials are also an awesome deal if you're looking for something quick, delicious and filling."}
{"text":"The best Thai food around. Linda and Karl will treat you with the best service and large portions. I've been coming here since 1997."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here at least once a week. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great. I have not been able to find a better value than their lunch special."}
{"text":"I called in an order for take out.  It was ready when I arrived.  I didn't believe it when she said my order would be ready in 10 minutes.  The Ángel Wings were probably the best I've ever had.  There were only 2 wings in a styrofoam container with a córner cut out to let the steam vent.  The wings had a crispy outside crust.  The inside was juicy and tender.  There was a small crunchy cabbage and carrot salad with a container of sliced cucumber and red onion in a sweet chili sauce sprinkled with chopped peanuts.  Yum!  The Yellow Chicken Curry was put in a plastic soup container.  It was spill proof, which I appreciated.  There were large generous slices of white meat chicken, cubes of potatoes, onion, and slices of carrots.  The curry wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it, but I had 2 little containers of chili peppers to add to the curry.  The Thai Iced Tea was strong, not watered down in a styrofoam cup.  I had a coupon from the mail for $5 off for purchase of $20 for take out or delivery.  They deliver within 3 miles.  They also participate in CityCoups.com where you buy one entree and get the second entree for half off.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here often for their lunch special because they offer a discount to UNLV students. I usually get one of the three curries they offer and my girlfriend opts for a vegetarian pad Thai. I tend to order the curry because I tried the sweet and sour chicken once and it was unreasonably sweet. My girlfriend loves their egg rolls and pad Thai because they usually customize it to her liking. The real problem here is the wait staff every time I come here I am greeted by a waiters that are rude and apathetic. I try to be a \"good customer\" but it never seems to help, but when I consider the money I've spent I always leave this place feeling satisfied.  Pros: 1. Lunch special food is very good considering the price. 2. Their curry is delicious! 3. The decor is really nice. Cons: 1. The waitresses are rude. 2. Certain menu items are much too sweet!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our favorite Thai restaurant. Lately, we noticed that the place is not the same and the food is not like it used to be and portions are less. So we are not going as much. Today, we found out the reason is New Ownership. Unfortunately, a while back I had bought a Groupon for 4 to take my friends to my favorite Thai restaurant. Today, I noticed my Groupon will expire if I don't use it so I asked my friends to go but she is very sick with a flu symptom so I called the restaurant and asked first if we could do take out and they said no, then I asked if my husband and I eat in and buy 4 food and leave tip for 4 just like you have 4 people could we come in and use it. The new owner Joe started saying No way! He then complained about paying $25000 for Groupon and he is unhappy with them, so he can not allow us to come and take good for 4 half price?  I could not understand what he was talking about!!!  All I know is that I will not return to this place again!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had coupons for the King and I so we thought why not and give it a try! The restaurant is located near a man made lake but I don't think they maximize their opportunity of the great view. It seems as if their kitchen gets the view of the lake. If they could they should try to put a dining area in the back just to utilize their access to the pretty view.   We started with their  appetizers. I had the spring rolls which were  nice and crispy. They had this sauce that I thought would be my much sought after plum sauce but it was just a really sweet dipping sauce. It was good .  My husband had their Thai Beef jerky which was a little tougher than other places we have tried.   I haven't had curry in a long time so I tried their Yellow Curry .It had potatoes , coconut milk and of course curry . The dish was really flavorful and hearty.  They give you a big serving with plenty of rice. It can easily be shared between two people.   We ended the dinner with one of their frozen chocolate balls. It had a hard chocolate shell with vanilla ice cream inside.  It was a perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"i lived in Las Vegas for 15 years.  i am a big fan of asian food.  there are many in vegas but i always found King & I to have the best of everything.  Before i left Vegas, they would alway know when it was me calling and they would always know what i wanted to order and how much.  If you are ever in Las Vegas and craving good Thai food, go to King & I.  You wont be disapointed."}
{"text":"After taking a look at all the reviews here, I thought why not?  I called in for a delivery order and the woman who picked up the phone was extremely rude. Before I even finished my friend's address she said 'oh too far'  Once she let me finish the address, then she agreed we are within their delivery area. During my order I tell her I want \"Pad thai\" (I pronounced it just like it is spelled).  She didn't understand, and I said Pad Thai again.  And then screams at me and says \"you're wrong it is pronounced 'p-hut thai' Not pad Thai.\"  I continue on with my order and then she tells me they are out of beef! Total failure. Never ordering from there again."}
{"text":"I have been going to King and I since about 1994. This place is my favorite Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas, hands down.  Located on the main lake, right behind the big Citibank complex, they do both Thai and Chinese food. The staff are always very friendly and I have always received good service. Linda, the owner, will typically come over and say hello if you go in there enough too.  Whenever judging foods from different regions, it seems like there is always one item upon which all opinions are based. For example, a lot of people judge Mexican restaurants by their salsa. For me, I judge Thai restaurants by their Tom Kai Gai soup. King and I's is incredible. The coconut milk broth is perfect and the chicken and mushrooms are always just right.   For an appetizer, I usually get the chicken satay, although this is mostly for the peanut sauce. I love Thai peanut sauce, but there can be quite a bit of variation depending on the restaurant. King and I's is one of the best I've had.  The entrees are all good. I have yet to try one that I don't like. The only time I've heard anyone complain about one of their dishes was when an acquaintance ordered the pad thai. She claimed the noodles were too sweet. I didn't think so, but consider it a possible drawback if that's your favorite dish. Regardless, besides her, everyone I've ever gone to King and I with has been pleased.   After 16 years, I would recommend going out of your way for this place. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Quick and Friendly service!    I work near here and whenever I need a quick Thai fix, I come to King & I.  If you dine in, you would see that they have a lot of regulars here.  I always try to squeeze in a quick lunch with my main squeeze here.  As a matter of fact, this time around I ordered ahead of time, to have more QT with him over lunch.  When we got in, it looked a little busy, but our table was already set up with our food and drinks...WOW!! Soon as we sat down, they came by to ask if we would like anything else to drink other than our water that was already there.    We shared a papaya salad at its spiciest level, they gave me spice levels of 1-4.  I said 3 and it had just enough kick to it.  Papaya salad was very fresh and it was also served with lettuce on the side too.    Jesse N and I both had lunch specials.  I had Shrimp Pad Thai, he had Beef Panang Curry.  Lunch specials are about $7.95-$9.95 a plate.  Served with Won Ton Strips, Eggroll, Salad, Rice and your choice of entree.  Great deal for the price, I'm stuffed writing this review!  My Pad Thai was great tasting, not as spicy as I would like it, but then again, I was so hungry that I didn't even ask for my spices to make it spicier to my liking.  LOL, so yes, spicy wasn't there but that is an easy fix.  I had about 3 big sized shrimps in my Pad Thai, that may sound like a few pieces, but it was the whole shrimp, not shrimp that is all chopped up to say you had shrimp on your plate, and I like to portion out my meat with my fork full of carbs, and it matched up decently.  Tasted the Panang and that was actually flavorful.  I usually don't like panang, but King and I's version is yum!!  They also give UNLV students a discount, College Students, that's a score...its conveniently located near campus."}
{"text":"FAST Delivery!  This restaurant has quick $2 delivery.  You can even order online.  I get my orders in 30-45 minutes.  You can even order their lunch special with a drink, and it is a very good deal.  I really like the yellow curry and sweet and sour tofu.  The Tord Mun is also super good.  They even deliver their Thai iced coffee and tea - this a major part of my Saturday morning routine. It would be part of my Sunday morning too, but they don't open until the afternoon :("}
{"text":"this place is freakin awesome I love that they know me on a first name basis (even though I only order a few times a month) there sauces ARE amazing and they will correct I mean perfect anything I want to order I love this place!"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon this last week and went in for an early dinner. The entire menu had changed and ever dish went up by about $5! The quality of the food seemed to go down as the price for higher. We had a wonton dish for 9$ and pad Thai for 15. Wow. There are many thai resturants in the area to choose from, and now their prices are the highest.. food was average. Decor is nice , but the benches in the booth are worn, and i won't return at the price range. You can visit Kamol or Lotus of Siam at the prices they are charging. There is Thai Place at Maryland and flamingo or Thai Room at Tropicana and Pecos where you can get a great meal at half the price!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai restaurant in Las Vegas! If you know Jitlada Thai Restaurant in Los Angeles then you have to try this place out. Joe and his staff were great and attentive. Their food was amazing 5 star quality and fresh. We tried this Tom Yum Soup, Coconut salad, pork ribs and pineapple fried rice. Definitely coming back again to order some more"}
{"text":"We loved the spicy eggplant with beef and the green curry with chicken. Level 4 of heat is perfect! Cool interior and great service!"}
{"text":"Our go to lunch place and it's always a great experience every time we come here. The owner is really friendly and she always keeps the place up and running. My fave is the shrimp red curry! It is really made so well that I can't even eat this anywhere else... :)"}
{"text":"my husband and i drive across town just to come eat here. the food is perfectly made for us everytime. the Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are to die for. the calamari is soooo goood we see also see regulars that come here alot. it hard to find a great thai place."}
{"text":"I have visited the king N I for lunch several times and I can tell you that they have the best deal for lunch specials!! The lunch special is between $ 7 to $ 8 bucks but includes egg rolls, soup, an entrée and a soda..  However, I have to be honest but, you get what you pay for.  The food is not bad, but is not the best representation of Thai food. If you are looking for a decent and cheap meal then I will totally recommend for you to visit them. The Place is clean and their staff was friendly"}
{"text":"We had the shareable spicy seafood soup w/ spice of 3, it was pretty good.  I had some fried squid it was fried a little hard and crispy.  A Shanghai beer to wash it all down, I enjoyed the beer crisp refreshing and a nice taste.  Price for two ppl under $40 bucks is very good   We tried the spicy coco blue crab soup (good flavor but mostly broth not filling)and a seafood salad it was ok but won't order it again"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been going here since i was little and always loved their king & I fried rice.  You'll never have to wait since the location isn't too mainstream and is next to a nice lake.  The owner Linda has always been so nice and definitely knows how to care of her customers."}
{"text":"Love their brown rice! It's amazing!!! Everything is delicious too but their brown rice really stands out!"}
{"text":"I ordered Pad See Wea with shrimp and some fried rice, we had it delivered my boyfriend started eating the noodles then when I sat down I realized there was chicken in the noodles. I don't eat chicken beef ect only sea food and I made sure to clarify with the person I spoke with on the phone that I didn't want any other type of meat in the noodles and he assured me there would not be. So i called and verified I ordered the correct thing and he said he would have the delivery driver come and get my phone then they would replace it. I found that odd because usually they bring a replacement then take it at that time but I said ok and the driver showed up took my food then returned back to the establishment. About 20 minutes goes by (keep in mind my apartment is RIGHT across the street) I get a call from the establishment saying \"what did you order...?\" I said \"I ordered Pad See Wea with shrimp and some fried rice\" he said \"well thats what I gave you why couldn't you just pick out the few pieces of chicken\" when he said that I got upset and explained that I don't eat any type of meat except sea food and that he reassured me there was only shrimp. I said then if he was unable to meet my request I would like a refund for the noodles only as I had paid for everything already. Once I did that he starting cursing at me and saying I cant have my money back and how Americans have no respect for good food. I obviously hung up and wrote this review he was absurd and I could not believe I was spoken to like that.  Save your money people and go else where ]="}
{"text":"Why was, what presumably was the owner chanting \"slow down, take it easy\" with some people at one of the tables?  Seriously, obnoxiously loud and obnoxiously repetitive. If that was you, dude, total dick movie.  The food was good, but for the participation of the owner, you get 3 stars. Oh, and the tables were sticky!"}
{"text":"Quite easily the best Thai food in Vegas. The owners/staff always goes above and beyond to take care of customers. The spicy basil chicken is easily one of the best in town, no matter the cost. Plus, the location is always clean, and close to a nice park with a view of the lake, if you want to eat outside."}
{"text":"I love Thai food.  King & I had the greasiest Pad Thai I've ever seen; it was sitting in a pool of oil, and was inedible.  Our take out order was poorly packed; every item was leaking.  I placed my order online, and was told at the restaurant that they generally do not accept their own coupons for online orders, though the coupon did not mention this.  The reviews on the restaurant's website were mostly identical, and appear to have been written by the restaurant themselves.  Convenient location, but we won't be going back.  Too many good Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"2.5 Having been to Thailand, this food is not up to par.  I ordered the safest thing, Tofu Padthai and it tasted ok.  I also had the chicken satay and it was dry.  The peanut sauce was also dry and looked like it's been microwaved over and over."}
{"text":"My wife and I (from Alabama) along with my niece and her husband (from Los Angeles) just finished having lunch at the King and I (Tropicana location). We all ordered different entrees with different degrees of spicy. The food was seasoned properly and prepared fresh. The vegetables fresh and tasty. Outstanding service as water with limes delivered when glass needed refilling. Would give the restaurant an excellent rating. The owner spent time explaining the levels of spicy. Very friendly."}
{"text":"IF YOURE ALLERGIC, DONT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM GRUBHUB.  I put in the special instructions to bring change for $100. The driver and restaurant didn't even know that the field existed.  I'm not upset about that. However, what if I was allergic to something and the didn't read it.  Scary Stuff."}
{"text":"love the food. friendly staff. love love love their \"Gang Dang\" - Sauteed with bamboo shoots, basil, chiles, and coconut milk."}
{"text":"Expensive and not that good! $14.95 for beef salad that had way too much fish sauce (couldn't even tell it was beef) and $12.95 for tom ka. I spent $35 on two dishes for lunch and it was not enjoyable. For the area this place is located, and the quality of the food-- they should really consider lowering their prices."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I want a decent Thai food in the area I'm living in. Quality has been consistent for years. I guess I have tried everything on the menu except for catfish. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in for war won ton soup. Advertised as 8.95 on the menu. When I picked it up, the price was now 14.05. When I asked about the discrepancy I was told, \"Under new management.\" Will not return. You can find the same soup (similar quality) at other restaurants in the same area for half the price AND the price won't change unexpectedly."}
{"text":"This place is gross and WAAYYY overpriced even when using Groupons!  I've been here twice because I LOVE Thai food; and when I saw a great Groupon deal, I bought two Groupons...foolish of me.  I had to use them because they were about to expire.  This place makes my skin itchy.  It's dirty, the A/C was barely on(I was already sweating like a pig before eating, which makes it very uncomfortable), service was SOOOOO slow, the food wasn't good nor authentic, and their prices are a joke!  I didn't enjoy anything during both visits.  I'm just being honest!!!  I'm just gonna stick to my fave Thai restaurants Krung Siam and Archi's(on Rainbow/Sunset).  No thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm bewildered because it looks like this place has some solid reviews, but based on my take-put order I placed with Uber Eats last night, i can't say I'll be ordering food from this place again.  What I ordered: Panang Curry- I ordered it medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all... like no spice; but that's not the bigger deal, it's that the curry was super, super, sweet. Just not very good. The consistency was great, the flavor was just off.  Pad Thai (with chicken)-This was terrible. Legit, the worst pad Thai I've ever had. The noodles weren't the \"normal\" pad Thai noodles, rather they were more round like chow mein style. The noodles were very dry and had a strong flavor of old grease. (You know the flavor of old french fry grease style). Furthermore, the chicken in the pad Thai was large chunks with gristle. Sorry... I don't do gristle. I'm all game for some juicy dark meat, but gristly chicken is a deal breaker for me.  White rice- O.K. A little over-cooked and mushy... but passable.  Crab rangoon- Inedible. No, really... I KNOW good crab rangoon; I'm a connoisseur of crab rangoon (just ask my thighs). The crab rangoon had a really funky flavor, combined with the old grease flavor. I ate 1 and threw the rest away.  An order like this being not shared by anybody should at least give me leftovers for a day-- alas the food was so unappetizing I threw it all away.   I know this place has some good reviews, but my experience with food alone was not a good one."}
{"text":"I can't complain of the taste of the food. Pad see ew was great. But the portions were quiet ridiculous for the cost of a dish. I also planned to get a seafood hot soup but it was over priced. Glad I did not order it. I'm sure I would've been disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Wonderful panamg, pad Thai,  eggplant with shrimp, amazing sweet chili shrimp. Love it"}
{"text":"The King and I is really close to my house so I try and frequent the place whenever I have a Thai craving (at least once a month).  I usually go with the Singapore Noodles with shrimp, BBQ pork, onion, carrot and egg.  The most unique thing about this dish is the incredibly thin noodles.  Whenever I describe to a friend that they're just a little thicker than human hair, I get odd looks.  But I like my noodle THIN, thank you very much.  The BBQ pork was almost inedible this time, something I plan to point out next time I'm there.  The spring rolls are always good but pass on the egg rolls.  I also love the Pad Se Ewe on occasion.  I was happy to see it crowded there on a Saturday afternoon, as this is not usually the case.  Not my best meal but I'll share my feedback and hopefully next time will be an improvement."}
{"text":"Good selection of food. Flavors on point. Pad Thai awesome! Very friendly waitress and food was fast. Ordered 9 dishes and came out within 20mins. We were the only boy ones here at 830 on a Monday night. High recommendations!"}
{"text":"The food was good but a little on the sweeter side. The portions were well sized and the service was good. We used a Groupon on the Groupon app and saved A LOT of money which made it even better so make sure you get that before you go."}
{"text":"This review is for the Thai food, Long story short.. It tastes like Chinese food.. I suppose it's understandable since they are serving both styles here but if you're looking for authentic Thai, this is not the spot. Good service and cozy ambiance though"}
{"text":"I used to eat a whole lotta Thai, but I must've wore out that cravinig because I haven't had it in quite some time.  This is my friends favorite spot so I agreed to meet her for lunch.  It's right next to UNLV in a strip mall location.  The place is tiny and looks like a typical tiny Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  The staff looks Thai to me, too, so I was thinking, this should be BOMB!  At the end of the meal, it was so-so.  The service was good and friendly.  They have lunch specials so my friend ordered Panang Curry, and I ordered Red Curry.  They seemed to taste the exact same to me.  In addition, the lunch special comes with a salad, a side of rice, an egg roll, and...two tortilla chips?  The salad was simply some iceberg lettuce with a not-so-appetizing dressing.  The egg roll is tiny and tastes like something you'd buy in the frozen section and microwave at home - all wrap with a little cabbage and carrot inside.  The curry was actually good and had a nice balanced flavor, but I think my homemade curry tops it 100%.  Anyway, it was super cheap and though the food was mediocre, the service and company made it a pleasant lunch."}
{"text":"I can't deny their food is delicious. Every single time. Every dish is great. My only beef is their delivery time is always longer than they say. It's always 45 minute wait time but I wait between an hour to an hour and a half. Only knocks them 1 star bc their food is great!"}
{"text":"Under new management! Nice ambience and service. Decor is interesting. Large menu. We ordered papaya salad, seafood tom-yum, green curry, fried rice, drunken noodles (requested), and Thai tea. Average Thai food and price. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand in the past and a dish that always warms my soul is Chicken Pad Thai.  I prefer mine with a little spice 3/5 and lots of nuts on top.  Sometimes I'll get the spring rolls or salad rolls both of which are delicious as well.  If you are thirsty try their Thai Iced Tea, it's always fantastic.  All in all this place is great.  A quaint little place with a great vibe.  I would highly recommend it next time you are in the area."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years whenever we visited Las Vegas and it was one of our favorites, so just recently we flew in again and we recommended to and met up with a friend who just transferred to Las Vegas, expecting a special dinner with her, especially since it was her birthday too! My first impression when walking through the door was that the ambiance had changed. No more dimmed lighting and the beautiful wall hangings were no longer there. The pretty menus were now replaced by some plastic folder menus. Didn't see any familiar personnel either. We ordered the Pad See Ew, fish fried rice, and yellow curry, ALL were super salty. My noodles were pretty smashed too and didn't look appetizing at all. To top it off, for dessert we ordered the coconut ice-cream, would you believe they served us PECAN ice-cream with chunks of pecan? Did they really think we wouldn't notice? Why not telling us straight up they were out of the coconut ice-cream or something but not just serve us some kind of replacement! The mango that came with the sticky rice was also not ripe and sour! I guess there was a change of management. We had to apologize to our friend but she was more happy to see us than the disappointment of the food! I never write any reviews but this time I had too since this one took the cake. Never going there ever again!"}
{"text":"Love the flaming \"Tom Kah Gai\" soup. Presentation was awesome; it's served in a pretty cool soup bowl that has fire coming out of it in the center. It's a communal bowl for the table, so sharing is ok.   The food is pretty good. I'm not big on spicy, so I stick to the simple stuff. Typically just get Pad Thai, Beef Oyster Sauce entree and a few appetizers. I also enjoy the chinese touch on some of the dishes. Yum.  The place is pretty relaxed as well. The lady owner of this King & I has a pretty funny haircut too. You can't miss her."}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm very picky when it comes to Thai food and the staff is always nice! Plus they deliver and I live on the strip!"}
{"text":"Went here twice in past week because of outstanding food & service that they greeted us with. Their Tom Yums Goong & Pad Khing Sod are delectable & fully flavored w spice. The detailed  service and cleanliness add to the experience of dining here. For Mothers Day they brought a special chocolate dessert out which was a beautiful addon for scrumptious dinner."}
{"text":"We loved this place!! The service was friendly, the food was excellent and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. We ordered the chicken satay appetizer (delicious!) and the beef jerky. Both came with yummy sauces and were a great way to start our meal. We also ordered the Panang curry, Mongolian beef, and Pad Thai. All definite repeaters. Overall we were more than pleased with our experience and will be returning."}
{"text":"I ate there tonight with my mother in law and wife. I have been here several times and the food is great. The service was good and I enjoy the decor of the restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside however when you step inside you can see all the work the owners have done inside. It definitely pays off since one of the reasons I enjoy this restaurant is the atmosphere and artwork on the walls. Their food is top notch with my favorites being their Egg Drop soup and their Fried Tofu with veggies."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Thai restaurant. The food is always top notch and the service is so friendly. I'm a fan of the chicken curry, pad kee mao, the king and I spicy rice and the pad Thai, the desserts are surprisingly good too. Linda is my favorite hostess, so if she's there you're in for an extra special dining experience."}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about unprofessional! Do NOT order from these people. They are literally five minutes away from our house took an HOUR to deliver ONE meal AND FORGOT THE RICE! Really? Also, while I like to give people the benefit of the doubt it is obvious they did it on purpose since they closed at 9pm. We ordered at 8:30. This is a loss for them because we had been ordering weekly! Note to the management there: Talk to your people about professionalism and making the customer happy. Not only does it make you look bad but it's really a punk thing to do. NEVER ORDERING OR EATING THERE AGAIN! GO TO ARCHIS INSTEAD!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Large portions. Great family owned restaurant. The owners are so welcoming."}
{"text":"My favorite thai in all of Vegas and Henderson. Portions are huge! Prices are great. It's tiny and hidden but I've never had to wait for a table. Can also order to go."}
{"text":"This is probably our new favorite Thai restaurant. We've gone to a few and there's a few places that make the spicy basil beef - in slice beef and not ground beef. Hard to find places that makes it the way you want it. We've ordered here 3 times in 2 weeks and they deliver. It can't get better than that. Super delicious we like ordering here and delivery is fast. Thanks"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!! I am originally from California and it has been very difficult to find a restaurant that served amazing fried rice. I went to the King and I for lunch one day and I wasn't disappointed. The combination fried rice was on point and abundantly flavorful! There wasn't a lot of shrimp in it, but other than that, it was amazing! They have awesome lunch specials as well! I will be going there again! I found what I've been looking for!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. I gave this place a chance, I really did. 6+ visits. It seems like a diamond in the rough and that it would of become my new favorite Thai spot, but there are many reasons that this place is lacking, and is best avoided.  The first impression of this place was good, it had nice decor and seemed like a very good menu. The Pad Thai is the only good thing I've ever tried here though, the curry is too watery, the tofu too over fried, and there's more onions than anything in the vegetable dishes. One time our rice was even burnt to crunchiness, ew.  While that put me off in all of itself, the tipping edge of never returning here is the rude server we seem to always get. Most of the waitresses are nice, but there's always this one waitress(maybe waiter, she sounds like a man) that is rude as all hell when we visited here. She's not friendly to the customers, and slams food and glasses around. Like shit dude, if you don't like your job go get another one and quit making everyone else miserable.   While I'll miss the Pad Thai, I'll be finding another Thai spot to replace this horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"I found out about King and I through my Delta Sky Miles Dining listings. It was close by and I figured I had nothing to lose and still earn some miles. I went during the swing shift so it was nice and quiet and I knew I would be able to enjoy myself without feeling rushed and crowded. My waiter as nice and helpful with selecting my choices. For an appetizer I chose the spring rolls. They were the crispest spring rolls I have ever had. They cut them in half so you can share with someone or take them home in a doggie bag for later. For my main entree I had the Pad Kee Mao with pork, mint, bell pepper, onion, and other spices served with flat wide rice noodles. It's one of the most flavorful native Thai dishes to be had. I like spicy so I asked for extra spice but they didn't believe me so I had to keep asking for peppers and hot sauce. But since I have visited several times in the last 6 months, I think they have gotten the idea. Subsequent visits I have enjoyed the Pad See Ewe, Singapore Noodle-minus the shrimp (allergic), Pad Thai, and the Won Ton Soup. I am rating this place as a 5 for the food. But I must say the service has gone down hill as the original waiter that I have had every visit except for this last time on July 27 wasn't there and I seemed to be an after thought with every request. I recommend for the food but don't expect too much on the service. It's great for a romantic lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery!  Driver was friendly and the food was still hot!  Ordered the Pad Kee Mao, asking for 10/10 very spicy....no other way to eat Thai food IMO!  They said they only rank 4/4, so I already knew it wasn't going to be hot lol.  Like what is the difference between a 3 and a 4 spice level?  Fairly spicy to mouth scorching?  LOL anyways...  Popped open the top, and I could tell it wasn't going to be very spicy.  I didn't see any hot peppers in there....only bell peppers.  They probably add a little chili pepper to the dish, but it is not fresh like from the peppers themselves....you can tell where the heat comes from.  Another thing jumped out and screamed at me...is that Chinese BBQ Pork?  It even has that fake red searing on it....bummer.  Sure enough, it wasn't very hot, I'd rate my 4/4 as a 5/10 in the more authentic Thai spots in town.  But the food wasn't bad, just not authentic thai.  If you are looking for authentic, look elsewhere.  Otherwise, you should have a decent meal :)"}
{"text":"Thai food is definitely one of my favorite foods.  The Pad Thai, Thai Iced Tea, Lemon Grass Chicken... mmm.  When walking in to this place, it's very small and quaint.  I didn't eat inside but I ordered over the phone and took it back to the office.  Looking at the plastic bag full of food, I was super excited like a little girl during Christmas day eyeing on the gifts.    After tearing the plastic bag open, flipped open the container filled with Pad Thai, spring rolls, fried rice and just dug right in to it.  Needless to say, I was so disappointed.  The Pad Thai had a funny after taste and while eating it made me want to gag.  The fried rice had no flavor to it, and I couldn't even finish it all.  I just picked at it and tried to eat as much as I could but my stomach and nostrils just had enough.  Oh, I forgot, it smelled very bad.  The only thing good about the whole dish was the spring roll and fortune cookie I ate in the end.    I should've just had Panda Express.  Atleast that tastes so much better."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special... $7.99 for your choice of entree with soup, spring roll, salad. CAN'T BEAT THIS DEAL."}
{"text":"My experience with the King and I restaurant was disappointing all around. On a Tuesday night, my two entrees and one side took an hour and a half to get to my house, even though the estimated delivery time for my order was 50 minutes. Once the food arrived, I was further disappointed that I was brought egg rolls instead of spring rolls. I hate egg rolls. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, and especially enjoy the service from the petite asian lady that has served me each time. I always order foods from the lunch menu, and have enjoyed each item. You can eat here inexpensively, and is usually crowded around lunch time."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. The food was good overall. The shrimp soup was very flavorful, the chicken dish I got was good, but not fantastic. Thai iced tea was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food restaurant by far I have eaten at. Not only was the food awful, but the manager was rude as well. Spicy Thai fried rice with pineapple and cashews is one of my favorite dishes and I have ordered it in many, many restaurants. Well, when this dish was delivered to my home, what I received appeared to be rice mixed with pineapple, cashew, and meat. There was absolutely no spice whatsoever. Not even a hint. I couldn't even see anything other than the rice, meat and veg. I don't even think it was fried. It was so incredibly dry. The Pad See Ewe had no flavor at all either. Just wet flavorless vegetables and noodles. The panang curry was not spicy, but at least I could taste that. It still wasn't very good. I called to speak with the manager to resolve the issue, but when I finished telling her about the Thai fried rice, her response was \"So what do you want.\" When I wanted my money back, Surprise! They don't do that. So if you want a large portion of flavorless food that's not cheap, this is the place for you. Gross. Do not eat here if you like Thai. Only disappointment will ensue."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a nightmare! The service was so slow and there was almost nobody there! I ordered seafood fried rice and we had to send it back because it was so greasy and wet.   It's not a Chinese restaurant at all!   The strip mall they are in is a very bad place also"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Literally. It took 45 minutes for the first dish to come out. The next dish came out 10 minutes later. Three of us were still waiting for food when we decided to leave. I have never walked out of a restaurant before."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the King and I.  I love curry and their green curry with bamboo is soooo nummy!  The curry has layers of flavor you get hints of sweet basil, coconut, and then the heat from the curry.  You select the level of heat, I picked 3.  It was just right for me.  The staff are warm and friendly.  The food comes out hot and quick.  The only reason I only gave 4 stars and not 5 is the dining space is small and they do not delivery to my part of town.  Other than that you should give this cute spot a try if you enjoy Thai!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have had better but this place is pretty good. Its close to the Strip as well. Nice Seating and the Decor is pretty cool. The Servers are more than friendly. The Lunch special is AWESOME. 6 bucks for Pad Thai w Chicken, A big mound of fried rice. 2 Wontons a eggroll and a Salad and Hot and Sour Soup. I had the Thai tea 3 dollars not bad. A Whole meal that filled me up for under 10 Dollars. Take that CRAPTASTIC Mc Donalds. The Pad Thai had the perfect amount of sauce. The Salad was simple and honestly im Amazed it came with that much food. The Soup was pretty decent.   Came with Big Chunks of tofu that didnt taste bland or like it had been over cooked. I should of asked for sweet and sour with my eggroll but it was still crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The wontons didnt have cream cheese just plain but were light and airy and crisp. The Pad Thai wasnt overly sauced and had nice chunks of chicken and peanuts just the way i like it. I will definitely frequent this place. So im not sure why it gets such low reviews.   4 stars because the service was hit or miss when i was first seated. But then it was on point."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening, when we arrived we were the only customers but it started filling up by the time we were done with our meal. The restaurant is cute and cozy, (very small), service was great. It took us a little longer to get our food than we're used to with Thai food, but it wasn't overly long. We ordered the pad prik king and red curry, both with chicken. They were both delicious and the green beans in the prik king were cooked perfectly, still a little firm and not mushy, just as they should be! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing we need more of in Las Vegas it's Thai food.   The current structure of one every block simply will not do!   Needless to say I was excited to try the King & I when it popped up on my \"Best Matches\" list on my way back from a haircut (Hypnotic Salon, check my review [plug plug])   I went simple on my order with a Chicken Pad Ka-Pow (they spell it Kra-Pow on their website but I've seen in Ka-Pow on others which sounds much cooler).   Right off the bat I loved how they asked if I wanted the chicken sliced or ground.   Sliced, always sliced.  Then they asked me for a spice level and I went my usual 7 out of 10.  They then asked me for a level from 1-4 which totally threw me for a loop.   I didnt really get why I had to do the math conversion myself.   Let's see, 10/4 is 2.5   so 7/2.5 is a 2.8?   #1) I have no idea if I even did that right and #2) in real life I ended up just saying \"2 and a half to 3?\"   I also ordered a bottled water as advertised on their site and was told they only had iced tea or lemonade.  I was mildly flustered with this whole process.  Service was friendly in regards to picking up the food, and I brought it back to the office to eat.  The 2nd big bright bonus spot in addition to the sliced/ground option was the plethora of sauces they provided.  In my bag were packets of soy sauce and hot mustard, and little containers of hot sauce and sweet and sour sauce.  Way to be thorough!   As for the meal itself I was surprised to find a small fruit salad, an egg roll, and lots of those (technical term ahead) crispy fried wonton strip thingies.  The egg roll may have been the best bonus egg roll I've received in a Thai lunch special, as it tasted fresh and was larger than I usually expect.  The fried wonton crisp thingies were delightful as always, and I bypassed the fruit salad because it was too healthy for me.   I really enjoyed the flavor of the KA-POW!, and actually prefer it to many of the other versions I've tried at other restaurants here in town.  If you would have seen me scarfing it down in my office you'd have thought I was going for a record.  The only thing disappointing about the meal as a whole was I didnt really get any kick out of the spice level I requested.  I'm not sure if when I called they didnt understand when I said 7 out of 10 or if they actually do just prefer to deal with a 1-4 level, but next time I would definitely try a solid 3 or maybe even 3.5 given the lack of spice I got this time.    Overall very solid!  With only 500 options for Thai restaurants here, it should be easy to make room for King & I for a visit."}
{"text":"Me and my BF love love love Thai food. I had been craving some since a long hard day at work kicked my butt. I checked yelp to see where we should venture out to. I guess I was let down. When you walk In the place is super super small and they don't have a sign to tell you to seat yourself or wait to be seated. So after waiting for a min or so with no one saying anything we sat ourselves. They Handed us our menus without a word being spoken. Is it quiet night? After looking over the menu we decide on the kings rice and pad see eww The waitress came over and took our drink order and dinner order.  Food was ok. Rice had a nice flavor but the pineapple was canned and we only had two shrimp in the whole dish. I couldn't find much chicken and the pork did not have a good flavor at all. Pad sei eww was super salty but the broccoli inside was good. Not once did anyone ask how our food was or if there was anything they could get us. I'm not asking for million dollar service here but some service at least?   Def will not return we will go down the street to David wongs pan Asian where the food is great and the service is excellent or krung Thai if we just got paid its a little pricy there but worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"King and I has the monopoly on the takeout Thai food at my work. With 1200 employees in our building and only one Thai restaurant that delivers to it, we have little choice. That being said, the takeout orders have a completely different look and taste than if you're dining in. I decided to dine in last week since I was in a hurry (sorry Archie's) and ventured here. The restaurant has gone through a remodel since the last time I was there and it actually looks quite appealing inside. The service was on par, the drinks were refilled regularly and the food was prepared with minimal wait. The lunch special that I normally order from work came out more than twice the size of what gets delivered in those Styrofoam boxes. The taste of the food here is eh-okay, but the service and close proximity to my work make it more attractive to me. The pad see ewe is decent, the Plar Goong (shrimp salad) is delectable. The pad Thai is okay, nothing special and the spicy mint chicken wasn't so good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. I know it's a little off the strip but I'm surprised it was so slow because the food was phenomenal(!)  We started off with the Chicken Satay and continued to share Cashew Nut cx the Panang curry (also with chicken). The portions are really big and the taste is spot on. We got medium spicy for both entrees and it was just enough to give you a little kick and get the nose going, but still be able to get all the flavors. Friendly staff, and it looks like they have good lunch specials too... Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had food delivered to our house.  The estimated delivery time was 45 mins to an hour.  The actual time was closer to an hour and a half.  The food was very good.  We had bbq ribs,"}
{"text":"The worst Thai Food Ever never finished anything! We complained about my scallops being cold and borderline raw. Pad Thai? Really? Not even recognizable as pad Thai let alone taste like it.  The best part of the meal was the beer. Stay away. The positive reviews are bogus!!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me, and so away I went.  It's in a nice little shopping center, situated right next to the lake of \"The Lakes\".  Things started out well enough, my girl and I reviewed their selections, placed an order, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  A girl came in, placed a to-go order, left, came back, and picked up her order.  We still waited.  Bear in mind that there was only one other couple in the restaurant, who had already gotten their food, and were finishing up eating.  Finally, we got our food after about 45 minutes.  The pork ribs were actually frozen internally.  Not as in frozen completely solid, but it was that stage of cold where the ice had just melted, but its temperature still permeated the food.  It was colder than my drink.  The rest of the food was just okay.  I wanted to like it, it just wasn't anything exceptional.  Finally, we waited for the check.  We kept trying to get the attention of the waitress.  We were the only customers at this point, and she was watching TV and chatting away to a friend on her cell phone.  Finally, after a loud \"Excuse me\", she turned around, told her friend she'd call them back, and got us our check.  Not impressed.  Still, the view surrounding the restaurant is wonderful.  We took a nice walk by the lake, and then decided to find something else to snack on to pad our unsatisfying lunch.  Great location, frozen food, distracted service.  Don't bother.    UPDATE: And while I've been \"reviewed\" myself in this review for being some sort of \"meanie\" in not finding perfection during my unsatisfactory visit, I don't think it would be a reasonable expectation for me to just automatically 5-star this place because I was unable to enjoy the same apparently positive experience that others did.  I visited during a seemingly \"off\" day, unfortunately, and my review reflected that visit as such.  No need to start an opening review paragraph to \"call me out\".  I'm not in this to review other Yelpers."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place since 1993 although there are new owners the food is the same, it is the best Thai hands down in Las Vegas.Lotus of Siam has nothing on this place.  I suggest chicken Panang with potato as hot as you can stand it. The chicken sauté is delicious. The house fried rice is awesome. And the new owners are very polite and courteous. I promise this will become your new favorite Thai joint."}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai places around town, always so good .  I never had anything that I don't like from their menu.  Great portions"}
{"text":"I love the panang curry here ! Best Thai lunch special in Vegas! Would recommend for dinner too !"}
{"text":"Really wanted to try their food. Was very excited about it. BUT when I pulled up my Groupon I realized it was for two or more people. I have no one to go with. I went inside anyway, explained my dilemma and was told absolutely NO, I could not use the Groupon even if I bought enough food for three people. I left completely DISAPPOINTED and STARVING. I can't recommend King and I due to their inability for find some acceptable solution to my problem, which upsets me because, who knows, their food may be fantastic but I wasn't given an opportunity to find out. Any chance you want to make this right King & I before you lose a potential regular customer????  Feel free to contact me at jinnifer.rister@yahoo.com. Hope to hear from you soon."}
{"text":"What a friggin nightmare!  NEVER coming here again.  My boyfriend and I are both sick with mega colds, so we decided to order some food for delivery.    We've been regulars at this restaurant for a loooong time.  Personally, I've been coming here for well over 5 years, and I've never had any issues before.  We ordered Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Won Tons, and Tom Kha Gai for a total of about $40, for delivery.  The food was delivered on time, but everything was horrible!  I couldn't believe this food was even from the same restaurant.  I actually wondered if we had accidentally called some other place.  The won tons were hard, and looked baked.  The bottoms were flat with little bumps on the bottom (maybe some frozen, boxed brand?).  One of the won tons looked completely different than the rest.  It was a lot smaller, fried-looking, and a different shape.  Wtf?  The Pad Thai was bland, and the noodles weren't even the right kind! The Pad See Ew was mushy, and gross, with almost no sauce. All of the chicken was horribly overcooked.  The food was so bad that we decided to drive over, and return everything without even trying the soup.  I calmly explained everything to the owner when I got the restaurant, and he was a complete asshole to me!  I apologized, told him that I wasn't trying to insult him, and that I loved his restaurant, but that this food just wasn't up to standard.  He ate a bunch of the food from our takeout containers (ew!), and said that it tasted the same as it always did.   He wouldn't even admit that it looked different, when it obviously did.  He refused to give me a refund, because it wasn't \"merchandise\".  After loudly arguing with me in front of about 10 other customers, and yelling at other employees in a different language while pointing at me, he finally agreed to give me my money back, saying that he had never had to do that before, and that he shouldn't have to.  I told him that all legitimate restaurants refund their clients when they're unsatisfied, and he actually had the gall to say \"OH, SO YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE!?\"  I was speechless.  Seriously?  Yeah, I just LOVE paying for delivery when I'm sick,  then driving around town, returning nasty food, and dealing with rude business owners. He said that he refused to deliver to me again, and that if I ever ordered pick up, I'd have to taste everything at the restaurant before being allowed to take the food home.  What a joke!  I don't think he'll have to worry about that happening any time soon.  I would have gladly given this restaurant another shot  if he hadn't been so insanely rude to me, but after this kind of \"service\"? There's no way in hell."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite Thai restaurant today at King & I from the great food great service and good portion size my friends and I for sure will be back"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the pad thai noodles with chicken. By far one of the best places I've had in town for this kind of cuisine! Pricing was very reasonable and the staff was extremely friendly also!"}
{"text":"Very plain, expensive, small portions under seasoned, or too salty, bad all around. Surprised at the four star rating, proof people in Las Vegas don't know what good food is. Service was good, owner is nice, still I didn't go there for a social visit it to have Thai food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants. It's a small hidden location. The food is fabulous and the staff is super friendly. They have great lunch specials too. You can tell they get a lot of repeat business by how well they know so many of their customers."}
{"text":"LOVE their lunch specials!   I'm a huge fan of Thai food and this place is definitely on my top favorites solely because their lunch specials are a great deal! $7.95 for an entree and includes a drink, egg roll, salad, fried wonton crisps, and fried rice which is a great deal considering how much food you get too!   My favorite is the Cashew Nut with tofu... sooo flavorful and leaves me full and satisfied every time! If you're not feeling a soft drink with your meal, just pay an extra $1.50 to upgrade your drink to a Thai tea or Thai iced coffee!   The staff are friendly and service is really fast - sometimes I'll call in for a pick up order and they'll have it ready within 5 minutes. The inside is kind of small but cozy and has has an authentic Thai feel to it.   Definitely go here if you're craving some good Thai food for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, and excellent service.  Right across the street from the university.  Would recommend to anyone who is looking for good food!"}
{"text":"GREAT for delivery! I've been ordering delivery from here for years. I don't mind waiting to have my food prepared with care but it always arrives hot & fairly quick. Never any mistakes. Over the yrs I've had a few inconsistencies; too spicy, too salty, or over/under cooked on the same foods. I've learned to stick with 3 items since I enjoy other Thai places for certain things. Woon Sen salad is awesome & large but unlike other places, they don't ask for a spice level so beware, it could light a fire in your mouth if u don't specify! Tom Kah Gai soup is exciting to the taste buds, perfectly sweet & sour. Papaya salad is yummy but again, it can light u up. Chicken satay is great too. I think $7.95 for 2 spring rolls & $10.95 for Tom Yum soup is high but for the most part, quality ingredients & timely preparation is considered. If u like this place, try Basil n' Lime on Ft. Apache. I go back n forth between the two, both of which charge $2 for delivery."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Purchased on Groupon. The menu extremely over priced! Food was beyond mediocre! Lunch special has no specific days on menu! But don't allow it during the weekend even before 1pm. Nothing we order was good accept the spring rolls... & they were just ok... So lunch at 11:30am on a Saturday was 57$! Neverrrr again!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We got the curry and the eggplant . So gooood. Highly recommend. Very fresh and quick service."}
{"text":"Okay, I thought I give this place another chance and I have to say, disappointed once again. I ordered the spicy eggplant lunch special this time.  Was not spicy, had chicken pieces that were cold so I checked to ensure they were cooked thoroughly, and the eggroll was overcooked and dry. The only good thing I got was the Thai iced tea. I can safely say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"King & I has been open since i was a kid growing up in Las Vegas so that makes them one of the oldest Thai restaurants in town.  The food is very authentic Thai with lots of flavor, sometimes a bit too much on certain dishes.  The portions are plentiful for family style dining and I recommend the Tom Yum Shrimp Soup on a cold night.  My only issue with the Tom Yum is the intense sweetness compared to other Thai restaurants.  Spice level is around a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the Tom Yum.  The curries are all good with steamed rice, specifically the green curry which is a bit sweet from the coconut milk but not overbearing.  I also recommend the beef or pork salad for a refreshing dish with veggies, fish sauce and lots of lime juice.  The dining area is quite small with just a few tables which makes King & I a quite intimate location located in the Lakes Estates area."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Had never been before but it's tucked away in a shopping center by the lakes. The vibe of the center made me feel like I was in a little beach city on vacation.   The restaurant was clean and beautifully decorated. Food was delicious. And service was great. It's a family owned restaurant and extended family own Le Thai, Le Pho and another restaurant he mentioned. It seems like quality food and good service is something that the family stands by and wants to provide, which I appreciated.   The restaurant was semi empty but was doing a ton of take out and delivery orders. I would personally prefer to go in bc it's such a cute spot and you can walk around the gorgeous lake and area after :)"}
{"text":"Costumer service by phone was not friendly... The basil fried rice was really too spicy and not even good taste... I will never order again from this restaurant..:(("}
{"text":"After writing my first review of this place, I originally gave them a 4.  I was raving about their pad thai, which I had a couple of weeks ago while dining in, and then had a craving for it.  So, the other night, my friend and I ordered food to go... Which is why I ended up dropped that first review down to a 3-stars.....  When I called in the order, the guy who answered seemed short on the phone, and after I got off the phone with him, I had a feeling that he didn't get my order right (a simple pad thai with tofu AND an order of beef satay).  So I asked my friend to double-check the order when he was picking it up...and yes, our order was incorrect.  Apparently, the guy missed the second item, so my friend had to order it then and ended up having to wait the extra time.  And even then, they ended up giving us chicken satay instead of the beed satay that we wanted.  Maybe it was a different cook OR simply because he had our food to go, but the quality of the food was not the same as when I first had it just three weeks before... The pad thai was not as tasty, it was on the salty side, and the noodles were not as moist and sticky as I had described them in my first review.  As for the satay, the chicken was dry and the peanut sauce did not look good at all... In fact, it was too thick (just not the same consistency as other, normal peanut sauces out there), and it just looked old and the color too dark (as if it was not freshly made that day and had been microwaved over and over again).  This take-out experience turned me off, as I don't think I will be returning for their food...especially when there are a lot of other thai restaurants out there who can offer better quality and better service.  Trust me, I've frequented other places, for both dine-in and take-out, and I've never had this problem of inconsistency before.  And this is why I have dropped my rating of \"King & I\" down to a 2...because I have DEFINITELY had better."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. We order takeout from here once a week. Delivery is speedy and quality holds up very well. I love their food and flavors! My favorites are the papaya salad, panang curry and the chicken satay. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in a long time.  It's been about 20 years. They must of changed ownership.  The tum yum goon soup egg rolls and mango sticky rice dessert was delicious. The spicy mint chicken I specifically asked for not spicy and hold the salt, it was so spicy and salty I couldn't eat it. I dranked all the beverages on the table. My mouth was on fire. I can't describe the waitress reaction. It wasn't the typically reaction that a restaurant would give after they messed up on an order. She made me feel guilty I sent it back. I was really looking forward to that dish, it was my favorite dish, however I could not eat it."}
{"text":"I had food delivered to my hotel about two years ago and it changed me forever. I've always been content with sweet and sour pork from places like Panda Express where the pork is chewy and almost unedible but not anymore. The King and I makes the best Sweet and Sour pork I've ever had. I make it a point to stop and eat everytime I'm in Vegas, no matter what."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5. Why is there so much hate goin on on this place?? The King and I is perfect for a quick lunch. They have nice, cheap lunch specials for about $7 which comes with egg drop soup, rice, egg roll, wonton, rice, and your entree. My staple of chicken curry was as I expected and the waitress was prompt.   What is not to like from a little hole in the wall with good food?? My only dislike is their spicy scale that is from 1-4. How can you justify spiciness on a scale of 1-4?!?!   If you're in the area craving some Thai food... this will satisfy your needs:]"}
{"text":"Yes if you happen to be in Vegas and on Tropicana find a gem of a restaurant. King and I is a Thai and Chinese restaurant. Found it on Groupon so the discount was a special treat. Food was good and sevice was too. Curry very rich and hearty with lots of meat and vegtables, crispy hot and flakey summer rolls that crackle in your mouth. Love the sticky thai rice. The Thai tea traditional with aromatic herbs and small jell balls that dance in your mouth. Don't be afraid to ask for spicy that have too! But beware spicy IS spicy."}
{"text":"Good business in shady neighborhood. Friendly staff and fast service. I have ordered fried spicy wanton and it was good!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food... however, this restaurant is by far my favorite. The price is incredible low and their chicken both fried and grilled tastes AMAZING! This restaurant has been her for over 20 years. Needless  to say they KNOW how to deliver AFFORDABLE high quality FOOD!"}
{"text":"I am so pleased to find this tucked away gem. I just moved to that area a few months ago and there isn't a lot of options close by. I stumbled on this via Eat24, it was close by (really close) and it looked good. Last night the boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. So glad we did, I will always eat here when I want Thai. We got green curry, pad Thai, combo fried rice, spring rolls. EVERYTHING we got was delicious, cooked well and full of flavor. Mmmmm mmmm"}
{"text":"***2011 Entertainment guide, two for one coupon***  MMMMMM Their SWEET AND SOUR sauce is yummy! I want to take a bath in it. Hand me a case of it please...  I was introduced to this Thai place through my friend Karen who eats here on a regular basis. This restaurant is hidden, very hidden as I used to live across the street from it for years and never once saw or heard of it.  So we went to lunch today and dined on two complete meals, hot and sour soup, an appetizer order of spring rolls and two drinks for $15.03. Very nice! Basically my meal was free, love it.  What we ordered:  Meals come with Hot and Sour soup which was really good!  Chicken Pad Thai w/rice  Pad Kee Mao  Appetizer spring rolls  Food was good, I am partial to Thai BBQ by my house, but was open to try this Thai restaurant as is my friend's pick and close to her Apartment. I was not impressed with the spring rolls Appetizer, a bit dry and not very flavorful.   Service was good, plenty of refills a flowing!  My Pad Thai noodles were good and the portions are good and filling for the lunch special selection.  I walked out stuffed, licking my lips and happy!  I took pictures, yay I remembered :)"}
{"text":"The food!! Come here for the food and you will not be disappointed!!! SHARE the dishes - they are HUGE. The $6.99 Egg Drop Soup was the size of a 12\" wide, 5\" deep salad bowl (used for serving).  You will experience a party in your mouth at this place."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this gem. The food is amazing! Flavorful and dream worthy. The crispy duck is my favorite. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Really friendly service and the softest ribs I've ever had that desolve in your mouth. If you can't handle spice DO NOT eat the spicy sauce but if you're gown with the spice put it on everything !"}
{"text":"I am sorry to see that of the many people on yelp did not care for the King and I. Personally, being a broke college student, the lunch specials at the King and I are portioned just right and include a drink for a pretty good price. Quality of food is consistent and staff is generally friendly. They have a fairly consistent following of locals during lunch and dinner so it's just not me sticking up for this place.   Note to self..... get regulars from the restaurant to write about King and I on yelp."}
{"text":"Love, love my first meal here, red curry with pork. The coconut basil sauce was amazing!! You choose heat level from 1 to 5, I went with 2, which was perfect! It was pretty spicy, and that shows me this place is the real deal! Lots of veggies in this entree, such as peppers and bamboo shoots.   My second meal, a shrimp curry entree, was less amazing. Again, the sauce was the star, but it lacked veggies. It was good, but I was so impressed with the pork curry that I will be getting that next time! They have a quick turn around on takeout and I never waited longer than the quoted time."}
{"text":"A tiny mom and pop-type Thai restaurant secluded in the middle of \"The Lakes\" suburb of SW Las Vegas (W. Sahara and Durango), serving up homey but flavorful Thai and Chinese food without the fancy culinary flare.  That is how I would describe King & I Restaurant.  Frankly, I think the location of the business is far from ideal, given the very limited car and foot traffic on the residential street it is situated in.  However, the restaurant has been in business since at least 1996 when it earned its first \"The Best of Las Vegas\" award and presumably is still operating on the same spot, so they must be doing something right.  They offer $7.95 lunch specials from 11am-3:30pm.  Besides their usual lunch specials, on each weekday there is a unique lunch special, and on Saturdays, all the weekday lunch specials are available.  I guess for those that work or live nearby, you can keep coming back and order something different every visit and not get bored.    My review is based upon my recent dinner visit to use up a Groupon I bought for K&I before it expires.  And overall, I was satisfied with my meal and the service provided.  I thought the price was reasonable for the portion served, as well as, on par with other Thai restaurants in the area.  The food I ordered was tasty. However, I thought that the culinary skills of the cooks preparing the food were just average, so on a typical day you are getting your average mom and pop-type restaurant food.  Yum Woon Sen (I have seen it translated as Thai Glass Noodle Salad at other Thai restaurants).  It is a salad composed of shrimp, chicken and clear/glass noodles flavored with spicy lemon juice. It costs $9.95, but is large enough to serve as an entrée salad for one average person, or plenty to split for 2.  I liked it, and can see myself ordering this as a small dinner.  Panang (Sweet) Curry - $9.95.  Choice of beef or chicken ($11.95 for shrimp), sautéed with kaffir lime leaves, bell peppers, coconut milk and peanut butter sauce.  It was good, plenty of chicken and a lot of curry to go with the rice until you are full.  Thai Iced Tea - $2.50.  If my one and only Thai Iced Tea is the typical glass served to every customer, then it is one of the better ones I found served in local Thai restaurants.  It is not overly sweet like at many other restaurants, but no refills (hats off still to The Original Thai BBQ on S.Jones for the generous refills).  Service was adequate and pleasant.  It was nothing special or extraordinary, especially considering that I was dining alone and the restaurant wasn't packed to capacity.  My food order was taken, and when it was prepared it was delivered to the table while it was still hot.    I didn't have room for desserts, but their selection of premade European style desserts (tiramisu, European Pie, Manhattan Truffle, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake) priced in the range of $3 to $4.55 had no effect on my typical urge to consume sweets before, during or after a meal.  Ambiance: 2/5  Just a small restaurant with Thai decorations here and there, with the bulk of it mostly out of view towards the back hallway leading to the kitchen.  I did felt relatively relaxed looking at the guppies and angelfish swimming in the small fish tank during dinner. Food:  3/5  Typical mom and pop Thai food at average price with nice portions. Service:  3/5  Adequate and pleasant. Price:  3/5  Some items cost more than other Thai restaurants in the SW Las Vegas area, while others is cheaper.  But overall it is pretty comparable.  3 stars!"}
{"text":"love the chicken satay the best in the city and they are always so pleasant and nice here and im addicted to their Thai Tea yummy yummy"}
{"text":"I've been noticing a lot of not so great reviews for this place.  My guess is that a lot of \"farangs\" (that's foreigners to you non-Thais out there in Yelpville) need something to complain about.  Either that or these are the same farangs that consider a chain like Thai Spice to be authentic Thai.  With that being said,  my family's experience with this establishment was awesome.  The service was very good and the waitress was impressed that I actually knew the Thai phrase for the spice tray.  Khrueng Phuang which to you ingrit speaking farangs means Ring of Spices.  Even though sugar was not part of their Khrueng Phuang, it did not dampen my impression of the culinary wonders that they lay before us.  Their chicken satay were pretty thick slices of meat and almost done like Chinese BBQ.  Although unlike many farang reviewers of Thai establishments on this site, a satay or a Pad Thai does not necessarily make a Thai restaurant bad.  The Pad Thai was medium, at the request of my farang company,  but that's what Krueng Phuang is for.  Spice it up ho you like it if its too mild.  If you need some pointers on how to utilize or even request Krueng Phuang,  invite me along to your next Thai meal and I will be happy to teach you.    Usually I don't order Pad Thai at restaurants since contrary to popular belief,  it is not the national dish of Thailand. For the record, it's Tom Yum Kung (Spicy Soup with Shrimp) Pad Si Yu and Rad Na are much better noodle dishes and we had the latter with pork.  Gravy had a nice consistency and they used the Sen Yai (wide to you farangs) noodles as opposed to the Sen Lek (narrow).  The Tod Mun was nice and thick unlike some of the flat pancake ones I have ahd at other Thai restaurants.  The Panang Curry a nice peanutty flavor and was spiced just right.  Overall, I will come back here again when I come back to Vegas.  Some farangs need to mellow out and just enjoy their meal.  As someone who is Thai,  I had some real bad Thai food (Thai Spice) in my day.  This place is one of the better places that I would bring my  mother to.  For the record, she is a native of the province of Petchabun."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in town! I'm a big fan of their Tom Ka and Tom Yum soups as well as their curry selection. The exterior is a little sketchy looking since it's in a run-down supermarket parking lot, but they've done an amazing job with the quirky decor once you're inside and I've always had great service.  The reviews seem to be a bit polarized, which is surprising. I've been here countless times and brought others and never had a bad experience. Their curries are not as sweet as some of the Thai restaurants that cater to American preferences, so it may be a matter of taste."}
{"text":"Very friendly greeting when we arrived, even though it was near closing. The atmosphere is unique and enjoyable. The Green Curry was amazing as was the eggplant. Great little jem!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place and was a frequent customer since its very close to where i live. I went today and saw they were under new management. I was worried and went in. We ordered our usual beef pad si ew and chicken fried rice -Portions for both items were about half of what they used to be for the same price. -The pad si ew was too salty -The fried rice was a bit bland.   I really did enjoy getting food here. I dont know if I'll be coming back... :("}
{"text":"Went here as I wanted something other than Pho. Which there is a great Pho restaurant next door.  Really like the decor.  The cost is good for the serving size is great.  The flavors are on point and feels very traditional.  I am no way an expert on Tai food, however, this food was great.  I had heat a 9 and thought it needs to be hotter at first.  Of course later during the meal I was not thinking that.  Was just right.  Going to go back and get the 10.  Just hope they are not bringing the heat down because I am not Tai.  Highly suggest this place.  Came here with co workers and they all thought the same.  Great flavors, enjoyed the decor, price was fair."}
{"text":"Online pickup order, and worth driving to. Definitely ordering again, maybe even go in for dinner with the bf. It's a small family place, food is picked up at the front. Now the most important thing... the food! It was amazing! Yellow curry sooo good, fried rice amazing. The smoothies are especially delicious. Had a coconut and mango one, both awesome. Originally ordered a cantaloupe one but the restaurant called me right away advising they were out. I changed it to mango, and wasn't disappointing. Portions are great. Got full without appetizers. I think I just found my new fav Thai place!"}
