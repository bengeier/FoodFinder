{"text":"What a great find! So far I've had the lechon and halo halo and I love it. I will definitely come back and try most of there menu during my stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"I went here and if you want to eat as if you're sitting outside, check this place out. They did not have A/C I guess they're trying to make it like the Philippines, hot and humid. It was so hot that it created a mirage in my head to think that the food was going to actually taste good, that was a joke. The food tasted exactly like how it looked, old. Food was not as good as all these other reviews mention, I'm guessing it's all friends and family of the owner. Very sad quality of food. Tastes like food that was sat out for days. I ordered the bistek and that shit was so damn dry I thought I cracked all my teeth with every bite. The meat was tasteless, what a waste of money and time. Don't believe the Yelp reviews. A place with no A/C and such poor quality food isn't worth anyone's time or money."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a quick fix of Adobo and Chocolate Meat. Will definitely be coming back here for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"always an amazing place to dine. food never fails.. simply delicious! friendly people! def a place to grab and go! must try desserts too.."}
{"text":"These people are crooks! We made a deposit of $150 for a whole lechon order 1 week before the event. We got a call from them 3 hours before the party that there will be no lechon. What ever the circumstances were behind this failure, they should've informed us well ahead of time so we could've worked on alternatives.  So we decided to replace the order with lechon kawali, embotidos, chicken afritada and sisig, whatever will be worth the deposit we put in. They instead delivered only embotido, lechon kawali and as a gratis, the woman said she's giving us 3 pieces of crispy pata,  but, we still gonna owe them $50. I said why do we still owe you when you failed to do our order? My husband didn't want any more confrontations, especially since we were at the church parking lot (another epic, they said they deliver, but they wanted to meet us at a closer location),  so he paid the $50 and the woman simply said there isn't anything else that she can do.  Lesson to learn:  Do not order party foods from these people..The 1 star rating is only for the crispy pata sauce!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the sweetest Filipino Aunty EVER! I've been to plenty of Filipino food places with shady people trying to nickel and dime you for everything.  But Aunty straight hooked me up with extra rice, and sabow (soup), to go with my two choice meal.  She made me feel at home, like I was her long lost nephew, and it was her extra TLC that made the efood that much better.  If she doesn't have something ready, she will cook it on the spot!  But if you're smart, you'll call ahead to make sure the food will be ready for you once you get there!  If I'm craving some Filipino food in Vegas, I'd definitely swing by here for some good home style food and special family treatment."}
{"text":"I was craving Filipino food so this place was the closest place to where I was at. When I walked in I saw only 4 items available. Looks like the 4 items were sitting there for a long time. I ended up leaving without ordering anything. I went to another Filipino place downtown."}
{"text":"allthough yelp has this as closed it is still open the best lupia and puinset in Vegas always friendly l;ove da caldoreta....."}
{"text":"Small restaurant serving Filipino food. I stop by here one afternoon while I'm in the area for take out food. Food tastes good but the beef was not tender enough for me to enjoy and digest. And another thing, they ask if you want to tip."}
{"text":"I have been coming her for a LONG time. They have the best lumpia shanghai! Chicken adobes amazing! A lot of other places have it but this one has a one of a kind taste. Marisa, the owner is a sweetheart. She is always so friendly. I like her turon. Every time I come here It seriously brings back memories of the Philippines. Oh how would love to go back."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Baba's since I just moved from New Jersey.  One of the major things on my mind once I arrived was to find a good Filipino restaurant that will satisfy my need for some good 'home-cooked' Filipino food.  This is the place. Not only do you get very good food, you get the 'Tita' that hasn't seen you in years experience here.  She will make sure that your belly will be all happy and full. Amongst my favorites are the Singang na baboy and all the adobos.  The menu changes daily so be sure to ask Marissa for a menu that lists what is being served each day. No matter what you have, always finish it with their turon."}
{"text":"Crispy Pata= Heaven   The outside was perfect, crispy not Greasy at all.   The meat was cooked just so.  The dipping sauce was some of the best that I've ever had.  I could just drink the dipping sauce, the wife loves it over her rice."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place and I'm glad she did! I usually just order Halo Halo at Filipino joints, I think it's because it's always sooo tasty wherever I go. Today however I was curious and went in with specific items to look for per instruction from said friend. I got the Lechon Kawali, Dinaguan, Pinakbet and their Ginataang Mais for dessert. I came early so the food was super fresh, the owners were really friendly and very welcoming. Emily was such a sweetheart and explained all the food which made me feel at ease ordering. When I got home I pretty much inhaled everything and passed out in a food coma right after,  lol. Food is definitely stick to your ribs and comforting. Amazing food and being so close I will  be back very soon!"}
{"text":"came here after searching for a new place to get my lumpia fix on,.... they were so nice and accomadating considering we came in right before  they were closing.  I ordered 100 pieces of lumpia to go,  my friend had never had lumpia before and she ordered 50 pieces after trying mine.  the sauce was  homemade at the restaurant and was way better than the store bought kind.  I will definetly be going back to try the full menu."}
{"text":"2 star place. Few items in menu, small portions and looks like food is been seating there since this morning. Food wasn't that good either. But place was clean and have TFC."}
{"text":"Everything I know about halo-halo, I learned from Mel and Terri. After following their ten part exploration of the city's best, I was curious to try this icy Filipino dessert myself. Located across the street from Big Dog's Draft House in a mostly vacant plaza, Baba's Tsi-bugan is run by the friendliest owners, who will make you feel like family from the moment you walk in. I live just down the road and wasn't even sure if this cafeteria-style restaurant was still open for business. They are closed Sunday and Monday, but open from 9:30am-7pm Tuesday through Saturday. I'm submitting the only review they've received in over a year in hopes that more people will come try their food!  I've only tried the halo-halo here, and it was great! For $5, I was impressed by how many items came packed in the cup: shaved ice, evaporated milk, ube, leche flan, red beans, macapuno, nata de coco, small red jelly cubes, palmfruit, topped with two scoops of macapuno ube swirl ice cream and garnished with a purple-striped wafer cookie. The ice cream was attractive and delicious, and having never tried ube before, I really enjoyed that, too! Of course, I mixed it all together, and then it was just like a cup full of jelly surprises with an abundance of textures. (Note: without studying Mel and Terri's reviews, I may have described it as a cup of ice with milk and gummy bears.)  The rest of the menu is intriguing, but I'm not too familiar with Filipino food. Read the other reviews, which are more helpful in this regard. Different dishes are cooked each day and the menu shows this, so I recommend calling ahead if you are looking for something specific. The buko pandan dessert in the cooler looked good, so I'll be back to try that. Flan and ube were also available in the cooler. Displayed on the counter, they even have various flavors of colorful puto (I can't finish this review without mentioning the colorful puto)!!!!  One day, I may learn to pronounce the name of this place, and maybe even its English translation! Can you halo-halo?"}
{"text":"We found them through restaurants.com. It's a small little hole in the wall restaurant but the food is really good for being on this side of town. I like to compare Filipino food to my mom's cooking and this was pretty close. Everything was still pretty fresh considering we came late. The haho halo was the best part! The owners were very nice and accommodating since it was my sister and I and our 4 kids!"}
{"text":"Great dinner. Sisig was amazing! Chicken Adobo was tender, although we agreed that we wish they would have used boneless thighs instead of those oddly cut pieces. The LechonKawali was crisp and tasty and the lumpia was also pretty good. My husband picked dinner up and brought it home. It traveled really well and everything was still crispy and good."}
{"text":"I was too lazy to cook tonight and when a friend of mine came to visit, I mentioned I was craving for lechong kawali (Filipino Crispy Fried Pork Belly). The closest Filipino restaurant is Baba's so I read the reviews on here and decided to give them another try even though I wasn't impressed with their food last time I was here.   I posted a picture of the amount I paid, I ordered the kawali, crispy pata (Deep-Fried Pork Leg) and dinuguan (Chocolate Meat). This is where I'm going to be buying my kawali from now on and my husband enjoyed the pata very much as well. My friend ordered the cheese puto (Steamed Rice Cake) and I got to try it, it was surprisingly moist! I loved it!   The man behind the counter was pleasant and the cook also came out and I complimented her on the kawali. I told her I might just order our New Year's Eve feast here. Coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is just so fresh and tasty. Pork lovers will really enjoy all of the various types. Young couple who own the place are friendly and show their Aloha spirit. Lumpia are excellent and the menudo is made with fresh pork and no tripe. Love it. You've got to try it if you want good Filipino food. Support your locally-owned operated establishment. Leave with a fully belly and a big smile on your face."}
{"text":"I bought some food & testing them cuz I planned on ordering for the Mayweather & Pacquiao fight back in May. Pancit Malabon was too oily, Lumpia Shangi and Vegetable Lumpia had a taste of Aginimoto The Sisig wasn't nothing to brag about. We weren't satisfied and ended up ordering from Nanay  Gloria on Maryland Parkway. I ate there before  under the original owner and I thought it was decent. I haven't been back since this bad experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Generous portions.  They don't use the crappy parts of the meat either.  The lady working was extremely nice.  She let me try the different entrees before buying.  She reminded me of all my Filipino friends' moms growing up.  The ONLY thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that it closes early (7 PM) and isn't open 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with facility/service. Took  a long time to make halo halo.  My family and I were the only ones in the restaurant,  then we were told it was CASH ONLY. Food was set out like a buffet, unappetizing, dried, and old. Would not recommend this cafeteria styled restaurant.  We were very excited to have a Filipino restaurant near us and my Aunt was really craving Halo Halo.  I read the reviews on Yelp and we decided to give the place a try.  The lady at the cashier was so unfriendly, by the time our halo halo's arrived, my aunt no longer wanted them.  I ended up buying 2.  They were average at best.  I am beginning to think that the 5 star reviews were posted by friends/family."}
{"text":"I really have to say I had my doubts abit eating a different cuisine than I'm use too. Mainly cause my stomach is very weak sadly. However this place was golden! Food was awesome and very friendly staff! Get here early though so you get some awesome food! I had a whole bunch of food here I've never had. It was all good and perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. I never write this much about anyplace but this is well deserving"}
{"text":"I came here this morning for sisig, but apparently the lady's husband makes it and he was out on a run, so sisig wasn't available. I also called around 5:30pm to try again and order sisig, but the lady who answered said they were closing. It says they're open until 7pm though? Ugh... This place is not consistent. Terrible."}
{"text":"Looking to kill my cravings and my cousin's cravings for Filipino food. I ordered   2x Kare kare,  32 oz Diniguan, large Lechon kawali, Palabok, and bihon total $66.24  I believe she was the owner and she was so friendly and welcoming. Unlike your typical Filipino restaurants here, look at you and look so disrespectful because I DON'T SPEAK TAGALOG!!! Not once she spoke to me in the native language, which was comforting for me.  I paid for my food and she offered a free dessert, so I got the cassava cake. I gave her $10 tip addition to my food and she said it's way too much, so she threw in another dessert, puto.   Well got home and we scarfed the food down... it was pretty good, not as good as my mom's diniguan... but it's doable. The Kare Kare and Lechon kawali was bomb. Bihon and Palabok were good. The 5 stars came for the desserts the PUTO, OMG I couldn't stop eating it, too bad I had to share. It was so moist and flavorable, coconut. I recommend the PUTO. I sure will be back.   This is the best Filipino restaurant on the Northside."}
{"text":"Wonderful filipino food and desserts! The cassava cake was heavenly! Emmanuel, the owner of the restaurant, is very friendly. Going to Baba's is a must when visiting Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 3 months now almost every other week. I love coming here because food is delicious and well prepared.  My wife wanted Filipino food but we didn't want to drive out to Jones and Desert Inn, so we searched and found this gem in the wall on Rancho.   We always get sisig, lechon, lumpia and sinigang but we also try whatever they recommend because they are all so delicious.  I love the flavors of filipino food and also some food similarities with korean cuisine makes easier to approach for me.    Food here is amazing because of a few things: 1. It's not greasy like other filipino food. Whenever I reheat I rarely see fat solids on top. 2. Everything is freshly made when you call ahead but I think they only make certain portion at a time for the hot food display table. 3. Service! Owner really cares about what you put in your mouth. 4. There is nothing more satisfying than pleasures of simple complexity in flavor.  They are very good at it. 5. I don't feel like crap after eating their food.  Today is sinigang day so we will be visiting again since yesterday.  Best sinigang I've had so far and that includes the ones I've tried in the Philippines.  If you love lumpiang Shanghai this is probably the best you will have in town. To me it is so far.  If you want to visit, please remember: 1. Bring cash it's easier. 2. Don't be afraid to try new stuff. (They are all great, if you are not sure ask for samples) 3. Bring cash around $40 because you will order enough to use it all. 4. Take their menu home with you. Put their number on speed dial.  Enjoy! I hope you guys share the same enthusiasm I have for this place.  This is probably the only 5 star restaurant review I have given so far."}
{"text":"I've had my share of 'de Pilipino pood' over the course of a lifetime.  Some up here, some down there.  But for me Baba's falls right in the middle.  Not bad, but not up there with my favorites.  First off, if I'm paying $7.99 per person it might as well be a Filipino buffet.  Here at Baba's for $7.99 you get a 3-item combo.  Eh, it's ok but limiting myself to just three choices, a questionable amount of rice, and a bowl of sabaw (soup) just doesn't work for me!  I want more!  Gimme more!  That's what makes Baba's so lackluster for me.  The plus is that Baba's is closer to where I live so in a pinch if I want Filipino food I don't have to drive all the way down to Chinatown.  But that's about the only plus.  If I wanted a certain type of Filipino food, myself or wifey can just make it ourselves.  On a weekend it wasn't very busy.  There were more folks either doing catering or take-out than actually eating in the restaurant.  Choices of the day on the food line were varied, but again, picking just three did me no good.  I wanted a bit of everything!  I ordered a 3-item combo with BBQ pork stick, BBQ chicken stick (yes EACH one counts an item), and pork guisantes.  Combo came with an OK amount of rice, and a bowl of sinigang sabaw.  I, being the great piggy I am, was able to finish this combo off in less than 10 minutes.  Pow Pow Pow...like Pacquiao!  But not in his last fight vs. Mayweather.  I was left hungry, but like Hell am I gonna pay another $7.99 for more food!  Had to go home and eat a Magnum ice cream bar for dessert.  But the food quality wasn't bad.  The BBQ sticks were good, nice charred flavor bits and seasoned right, salty & sweet at the same time.  Pork guisantes was just OK in my book, pork was nice and fatty, but the sauce was a bit lacking in flavor.  Baba's rice cooking though was on point, perfect Jasmine rice for the meal.  That's why I wanted more!  The sabaw was decent, nothing particularly special.  Reviews said that the crispy pata is the gotta have at Baba's, so perhaps I'll give it a try on my next visit.  It's a bit pricey though, no?  Like $15?  Hope the serving is large for that much!  Baba's, give us the buffet!  Ai sos!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer Alert...This review is strictly for their service, Shanghai Lumpia, and Halo-Halo.    That being said, I found Baba's to be 4 stars in my book.  First of all, service here is great.  I didn't get the owners names, but they treated us like family. One of the owners reminded me of my mom and couldn't help do what us sons of a Filipino moms do, that's joke with them a little.  She was game and did the same. As for their food, we didn't get to try much because they were out of almost everything.  Baba's on our visit was catering 3 parties at the time.  With only one person cooking in the back, this meant they were out of Chicken BBQ, Turon, and Chicken Adobo to name a few. But they still had their Halo-Halo and Shanghai Lumpia, which are my favorite Flip dishes.  As a Halo-Halo Hunter, I found that Baba's had pretty much everything I look for in Halo-Halo (i.e. Ube ice cream, legit ube, flan, white beans, and nata de coco).  One thing that was missing was red bean.  It was still good and found Baba's Halo-Halo up there with the challengers around town. Note to self...bring some red bean to make it perfect.  As for their Shanghai Lumpia, I thought that they were as good as it gets.  No one makes them better than my Auntie Heidi, but Baba's is pretty damn close.  I'm not saying I'm a Lumpia Hunter, but I am a Lumpia Whisperer.  Whispers..if they make them, I will come.  Come to eat Shanghai Lumpia that is.   Overall, I can see myself coming back.  This place is no secret.  Tons of regulars coming in and phoning in is proof that Baba's is some people's go-to Pinoy spot.  You don't have to be a Halo-Halo Hunter or even a Lumpia Whisperer to eat here. You just have to be a fan of Filipino food served by great business owners.  TIP:  Call ahead or pick up their menu.  Some items are served on specific days.  Shanghia Lumpia is all the time!!   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (466/500)"}
{"text":"Bomb!! when your cravings lead towards filipino cuisine. .come here. . blew my diet and not even upset...very worth it! Salamat Brother Eman!!  new line of respect for your culinary skills Bro!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place! The food is great! I am not an expert on Filipino food but this place seems pretty legit. A small mom and pop restaurant with very friendly owners. The first time I came here, I had no idea what's what and the sweetest lady ever had me sample all of the food so I can decide what I want. I tried a chicken soup, chicken adobo, chicharones, lumpias, some sort of pork and beef stews. I loved everything I've tried! The food served here is like comfort food for me. I love hearty soups and stews. Oh and the Halo Halo is delicious too!  Aside from delicious food, I love the service here. Very personal, accommodating, and sweet. Thank you for being awesome :)"}
{"text":"I was craving halo halo so I found this place on yelp.  Came in and ordered a halo halo and of course, Lumpia. 8 pieces an order for $4.  I ended up ordering two orders of Lumpia, because who can resist?  The wait was a little long, but it was worth it since everything was fresh! The lady working was so sweet and made me feel right at home.  Halo halo was perfect!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are obsessed with their Lechon Kawali. It's probably the crispiest we've had. We go there if we're craving for home-cooked Filipino meals and we always leave satisfied. The owners a very accommodating, too."}
{"text":"New management (atleast to me)! It should have been a clue when I called and it was an unfamiliar voice - been awhile since I've been to this place but one of my faves is Tita (Marissa's) pancit bihon she makes it on the spot and gives you a generous amount of shrimp.   Today I ordered pancit bihon, sisig, and dinuguan. Sad to say that the shrimp added were those tiny ones from a can. No one even touched the pancit. Sisig and Dinuguan were ok. If I had known I would have ordered at Kusina ni Lorraine instead.   Tita your cooking will be missed."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was in the area. Owner was extremely nice and very welcoming. The chicken adobo was good but different from what I've had in the past more sweet that sour. The halo halo looked so good I had to order one and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I do not know why yelp has marked this place as closed but all I know is I had the best pancit here just this weekend! It was loaded with shrimps, chicken, pork and lechon? I actually cannot get over it upto now. Even they're lumpia is super good too! Definitely coming back! Friendly service and good filipino food hmmm yummmm :)"}
{"text":"My go to spot to eat all of my Filipino food cravings when in Las Vegas!! The Crispy Pats is a must with a Halo Halo or buko Pandan!! so delicious!!! if you ate in the north area of Vegas eat here for your Filipino cravings you wouldn't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mode for somethng Filipino, had a taste for it. Wanted to share some with Phily Phil, So I placed an order for Bihon and some Lechon, and it was as tasty as I remembered. Glad to see a Filipino place so close to me, will be sure to visit it often."}
{"text":"I ordered some catering dished for a pool party I had recently. Everyone loves some Filipino food, so I was excited to try out this joint.   We ordered:  Sisig Lumpia Pancit Bihon Chicken on stick  Everything was super good. The only thing people didn't like as much was the pancit. I make it pretty often and they said that it didn't taste as fresh or as \"fishy sauce\" as they like it. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Especially because I didn't have to cook it! We didn't even have leftovers for about 15 people. We spent roughly $180 for the 4 dishes. Which is really not too bad.   Overall, we'll definitely be going back to this place. I want to try out some more stuff to compare it to my family's cooking. :) Also, I need more sinigang in my life."}
{"text":"Good food at great prices!  Turo Turo style...so point at what you want. Some cooked to order items as well.   All of this was $7.99 :  Chicken Adobo (Wed-Sat). Very tasty! Super tender, fall off the bone...without an overly saturated Soy Sauce flavor like others I've had! Yum  Fried Fish. A bit on the dry side, but there was a lot of flavor in the fish...just watch for bones!  Sweet and Sour Meatballs (Wed). These were very sweet, but cooked well and overall tasty.  Complimentary soup and rice...interesting combination of potato and greens...good though!  I was offered more rice during my mea...It was not needed but appreciated :)  And to finish, the Halo Halo Special ($5). This was very good! Mix it all up, and you have a yummy treat :P  I am sure I will be back soon to try the other goodies!  Pics :"}
{"text":"Love the food and service here. at least once or twice a week myself and my employees eat here. they even know what our favorite foods are. keep up the good cooking and you will always have my business"}
{"text":"Been all over town looking for a good pansit palabok and haven't really found one. The closest I've ever had was at Valerio's but they only have it on the weekend (Yes, a bakery has a good Palabok). Until today I found the best Palabok in town, it has shrimps, squid and clams. I found it in this place, it was a 15min wait but it was worth the wait. They don't have much to offer as I came for my first visit but I'll definitely try the other food they have offer, looking forward for that pochero on my next visit."}
{"text":"We used to send a co-worker here to pick up lunch. We had them (especially Marissa) on speed dial. And I know they dread when I'm the one calling because I'm not Filipino enough for them. LOL. We call and ask what's on the menu since it changes every so often but we always get crispy pata. Their version is different from what you'll normally see in Filipino restaurants - appearance-wise. Theirs is super puffy. Crispy pata is one of my favorite Filipino dishes. Fried, crispy porky goodness...mmmm...  The dipping sauce is great (soy sauce + vinegar+ jalapeno + onions)...I just gave away the recipe! Great! I'm banned from this place now.  CASH ONLY turo-turo (translation: turo = point). You point at the food you want and that's what they'll give you which is great if you're not super familiar with Filipino dishes. If you point with your lips, they'll love that! There are items such as crispy pata that's made to order.  Other things that are good here are: halo-halo, turon and pork BBQ. They're pretty generous with the stuff they put in their halo-halo (leche flan, ube,  beans, etc). The turon (bananas and jackfruit wrapped in wonton-like wrapper, fried and drizzled with caramelized sugar) is sweet and crispy. Filipino BBQ is totally different from what Americans know as BBQ.  The Filipino BBQ is on a stick and is marinated in soy sauce, calamansi/lemon, sugar and sometimes ketchup. Yum!  The first time I actually came here to eat, I was a bit shocked as to how small the place was but whatever. Pack it!"}
{"text":"Authentic FILIPINO FOOD and so fresh!!! I came in and immediately received a smile and friendly greeting from Emily. So many choices to choose from that I opted for the fried akule, chicken papaya, dinaguan, chicken adobo, pancit, Shanghai lumpia, vegetable lumpia and desserts.   The servings are big and Emily is kind enough to put the soup like dishes in separate containers. The lumpia and pancit were made fresh. I decided to wait until I came home to write a review. The food was so good that I am about ready to take a nap. I love that the restaurant is clean & the restrooms do not have that \"ruin my appetite smell\" very clean environment.  If you are craving authentic tasting filipino food- this is the place to come. Hope that you enjoy it as much as we did!!"}
{"text":"The BEST authentic filipino food in Las Vegas!  You have to try the Diniguan, Sisig, Tortang talong, Lecheon Kawali and the Bangus.  Thats what i ate and loved and i need to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Halohalo has improved! Unfortunately Marissa is no longer with us, but the new management is doing great! I think she'd be happy with how the business is going. Great service & food!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some of the best authentic filipino spots and came across this place. Went here last night with my family to try their food to see if we liked it, if we did we were going to have them cater my fiances birthday. We brought my mother in law with us because shes usually pretty picky with her filipino food. Well, they will definitely be catering my fiances birthday and any other family event we have. Everything was soooo good!! And the couple that owns this place are super nice. Loved this spot. We're so glad that we found this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow Marissa is absolutely amazing and a great chief. Also the customer service is excellent. They do carter to your needs when it come to bomb filippino food!"}
{"text":"I loved their food. Marissa always give u big servings. Very very friendly place. Everbody raves about their crispy pata which I still have to try. : )"}
{"text":"I have lived on the Northwest side of the valley for 8 years and never knew this little gem of a restaurant was here.  The owner was very nice and helpful when my sister and I were deciding what we wanted.  We were given a complimentary bowl of soup that I can't remember the name of but it was light and refreshing.  We both had the Adobo chicken and pansit, and my sister had the equivalent of Filipino beef stew (can't remember the name) and I had Giniling (I think that's what it's called). Everything was so fresh and delicious. We enjoyed it very much!!  Yes we will be back. Probably tomorrow because that's when they will have mungo."}
