{"text":"Delighted with this place!!! The chef knows what he is doing and the service is excellent. You will not be disappointed. We had the blackened salmon salad and the chef surprised us with a special treat! Ask for the chefs recommendation! Be ready for a great dish and experience."}
{"text":"The Service was great but the food was awful I liked it better when it was Alma. Alma had great food amazing steak and not to mention their collie flower."}
{"text":"The food here was awful!! Guacamole came out of a supermarket squeeze bag, salad was old iceberg lettuce, shrimp was mushy, dressing was runny, and service was annoyingly overbearing.  Totally lacks the ambiance & the food quality of its predecessor, Alma.  Wonder why that one closed, it was great!!! My friends & I will not return nor would we recommend into anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I had appetizers and drinks here with a friend and LOVED IT!  We had the Cherry Vanilla Manhattan, the Grilled Pineapple Margarita and the 6 Degrees Sangria to drink. All were excellent.  For appetizers we had the Crisp Cauliflower and it was AMAZING!  The service was exceptional.  We were seated inside and it was lovely so now I want to try the patio.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great find stumbling into 6 Degrees!  I have now been there three times and love everything about it.    First, you have to try the cauliflower app !  I absolutely love the halibut in the duck and my husband fell in love with their burger.    Second, being a bit of a wino... They have an amazing wine selection and even better, their prices are very very reasonable!  Can you say Silver Oak for $99???!!!   Third, I personally love an indoor/outdoor ambiance. Now that the weather starting to cool off I can't wait to hang out on the patio and cozy up around the fireplace.   Overall, I think I may have found my new favorite  go-to restaurant.  Great food, vibe, and of course wine!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly. Great Bar Manager Ryan! Food is delicious, the Crispy duck leg is the best. Also the Steak is perfectly marinated. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meatloaf/grilled cheese sandwich today. Had baked potato soup as my side and they even threw in some homemade potato chips.  Very pleasant server/bartender who greeted me by name."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this new place with some of my co-workers after a long week. Figured we would take advantage of the happy hour drinks and grab some food. We were all very impressed from the open patio bar and good vibe from the crowd. Drinks were great and very reasonable. Two of the girls in our group had margaritas (one pineapple and one regular). Both were excellent. Bartenders were very friendly and offered suggestions to their specialty drinks which we all appreciated. After happy hour ended we agreed that we better get some food. We all had different dinner items which were excellent and cooked to perfection. Burgers were awesome with great flavor!! I was not sure about the bacon jam so I had it brought on the side. Once I tasted it then the next step was to spread every bit of it on my bun! It was fantastic!  We also had the halibut, beef tenderloin and salmon which were all excellent with just the right amount of spice to give it great flavor. The owners made a point to stop by our table to check on things which I thought was great customer service and a nice touch.  We all agreed that this is our new happy hour and dinner spot!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Great venue, indoor space, outdoor space and bar; but disappointing food.  The skirt steak was, we think, actually hanger steak and not very good, while the fries were not fresh.  The \"crispy duck\", actually duck confit, was good but a very small portion.  With entree  prices in the mid to high 20s, there is just too much competition that is better.  Too bad because we live nearby and would very much like this place to succeed.  Compare, for example, Twisted Grove, which is so much better."}
{"text":"The menu here is awesome. The Ahi Tuna, chicken plate, and skirt steak were all delicious. Larger entrees are big enough to share with someone. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at lounge. Set out on the patio with a nice breeze and a awesome server by the name of Kori.   If you want good service and a good time come to 6 Degrees and ask for Kori!!"}
{"text":"I have never been here before and the service was amazing!!! My server's name was Elsa and she was the most kindest waitress I have ever had! I had the lobster roll and it was so good. Highly recommend checking this place out. It is so cozy and beautiful during this time of the year. I plan on going back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff.  Very comfortable.  Food was fresh and very good. We had lunch. Spicy chicken sandwich and salad.  Excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a fabulous find! My girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch and wow, food and service were amazing. I had the most incredible grilled salmon tacos. They had house made strawberry salsa and cotija cheese. Pickled onions on the side. Fabulous! My girlfriend had the burger with bacon jam and a fried egg. She said it was one of the best burgers she's ever had. Their happy hour, dinner and brunch menus look great, too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I try to frequent local restaurants (meaning within 10 minutes of the house!) so we took a cruise through Gainey village. We stopped in one place which is just a new iteration on a recent turnover but there was such an industrial cleaner smell to the establishment that no sooner were we sat down and handed menus, that we headed for the door. We scooted right over to 6Â° Urban Kitchen, also locale known for previous turnover. But this time we were blown away. The outdoor patio was hopping and we were served by none other than the chef's wife. Of course she did an amazing job explaining and suggesting the menu but every bite was fabulous. We had the pork rib frites and also cauliflower as appetizers, I had the cinnamon dusted scallops with Beet risotto, and my wife the Porchetta. And we were easily talked into the cheesecake/popcorn dessert... A must! Glad this restaurant has taken over and we will be glad to go back!!"}
{"text":"This may be the best new restaurant in the Scottsdale area!  The head chef is a Michelin chef and he has the recipes to back it up!  I'm not sure where to start...the ambiance is 6 times better than the last place, the outdoor patio is going to be awesome as it cools off with the fire place and tv's.  You should also know, I eat gluten free and this place accommodated my every request without hesitation!  Now the food.  Un-believe-able!  For the starter, get the House Fritas.  Almost like a poutine dish but with braised short rib and fried egg.  This could be a meal in itself!  Then we tried the Burger, which I would highly recommend for the bacon jam!  YES bacon jam!  To die for!  We also tried the half chicken and duck leg.  You really can't go wrong because they each have their own unique flavors which is literally and orgasm in your mouth.  For dessert....I had the blueberry cobbler.  WOW!  Amazing!  I was told the pastry chef will have at least one GF dessert on the menu.  So grateful!  If you haven't had this eating experience yet, make new plans and go there tonight!  You really won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"great place! love the patio and very tasteful decor inside and out. We ordered the cauliflower dish and their burger. Honestly I do not like cauliflower at all but our bartender and waitress Kori suggested it and it was amazing!! Great burger huge in fact and had a really tasty bacon jam on it!! We had WONDERFUL service by Kori she is truly pleasant and attentive and easy to talk to, she received a great tip for tremendous service and knowledge of the products on the menu. Also she serves very pretty and tasty cocktails. We will be back soon, oh and a added plus for me is its dog friendly on the patio!!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in here one day spur of the moment. We were very impressed. The service was quick and our server was great.  Ffee food was delicious.  We had some kind of loaded fries,  and tacos All great. Flavorful. Delicious."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant for lunch and sat outside in a delightful patio setting. The wait staff was very friendly and eager to please. The lunch menu consists of salads and sandwiches. I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich which consisted of a grilled chicken breast on a brioche bun with a pickle,  lettuce and tomato on it. Did not quite understand just what made it hot Nashville. For me, the bottom line is that the setting is very nice while the food is just average."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the restaurant scene in Scottsdale. We came here for our annual office Thanksgiving lunch and sat on the patio. With six different people we had the opportunity to try many different items on the menu and we were all very satisfied with our choices.   First of all, I'll note that our server, Kendra, was excellent in both greeting us, informing us of the menu options and providing service throughout the meal. Also, we sat on the patio and it was great! There is lots of space, it's dog friendly, and there is even an outdoor fire place and couches where you could sit on a cool evening and have a very enjoyable time.  As for the food, it was excellent. I had the crispy pork belly tacos with a side of the green chili pork soup and both were excellent. The soup was flavorful and spicy, as it should be and the tacos were incredible! One of my coworkers ordered the pork belly tacos as well along with the sweet potato fries and she agreed they were great. Other coworkers had the chicken cobb wrap, the Cuban, the Nashville hot chicken, and the chicken Waldorf salad. Everyone was very satisfied with their choices and some even want to go back to try other menu options that we didn't get to.  Pricing was moderate, and while its not the cheapest place to eat, you don't feel gouged.  Oh, and my boss accidentally left her credit card on the table, but when she realize what she had done and called, they had found it and put it aside for her and she said they had it waiting when she stopped after work to get it back.  6 Degrees is definitely a place I recommend if you're looking for something that is hot and new in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went here for first time to have a cocktail and some appetizers, and possibly dinner.  Our server never mentioned anything about a happy hour....we thought, well okay.....and ordered a drink each anyway.  As we enjoyed our cocktails, we noticed that 2 of the male servers had beards.  One was not very long, but it was bushy, and the other was quite long.  Big turn-off!  Who wants their food delivered by someone with their beard practically in the plates?!   Can't imagine ever going back there for that reason alone.  Only other comment is that the place was a bit too dark, and while we expected to experience a cool type of vibe there, there was no atmosphere whatsoever."}
{"text":"Food is spendy but really good! Took off one star because when spending this much for a meal, they really need more wait staff. The poor servers had tables both inside and outside, so perhaps this contributed to the slow service. Servers would benefit from having tables grouped together and not as many tables. It took forever for our poor server to come back to our table. We came during restaurant week and had the chicken crepe as our entree, it was delicious! Please put this item on your regular menu and we will surely be back! Our friend had the halibut from the regular menu which was also yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Ryan is the best and super accommodating. Great cocktails and amazing food. Super hip inside and good music."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Best dinner in a LONG time! We had the halibut on the menu and pumpkin ravioli special. Both dishes were excellent! The ambiance is fantastic. Bartender Madeline makes a great cocktail. The service, best I've had in the valley in I don't know when. I highly recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst slop I have ever been served. Artichoke pasta with mint? Guacamole was smashed avacodoes only. The bartender was great...and refused to charge us. I'd starve before I returned.  Eat your dog's food before trying it.   Vile. Repulsive. Disgusting. Sorry I have to give it even one star. I think the other YELP reviews are phony and planted in Yelp by whoever owns this horrible spot. Will not last another month."}
{"text":"6 Degrees is only one degree from culinary hell.  Drinks watered down. The lobster risotto may well have been a soup it was so liquid. The Yakitori was passable but the rest of the experience was terrible tonight. Take a pass on this until they get their act in order."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch. I was the only unhappy customer.  I had the Cuban sandwich: poorly assembled and no flavor from the meats in it. The martini tasted fine and was priced fairly but the waitress didn't know what a twist is so I got olives first then 1/8 lemon wedge. I demonstrated how that becomes a twist. My wife and one friend had salads and thought they were great.  Other friend had meatloaf sandwich and thought it good. Service was adequate. They don't serve dessert!!  Prices seemed high: $14 or more for most salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I took my wife to the Urban Kitchen for Mothers Day. When we showed up we were greeted with a warm friendly welcome. When we told the Hostess that it was our first time there, she asked if we had reservations for the brunch. An although we didnt have reservations she was able to seat us within a few minutes and made us feel very special the whole time. The waiter was very attentive and within another few minutes directed us to the brunch serving area. We havent gone to a brunch in years. However, the food was excellent; bacon, sausages, bread, fruits potatoes were tasty and lightly season just right. Nothing was out of a box. Omletts that were made to order was just right. And the pancakes that were brought to the table were homemade. You were going to bust that diet cause these cakes were not fat free. They were great. The atmosphere was family friendly, yet a couple could enjoy a nice meal without a lot noise from kids. Then during our meal the Hostess brought my wife a beautiful rose. That was a special touch. Because of our great experience plan to visit again and highly recommend others do the same. Thanks to the Staff for being apart of making Mothers Day very special."}
{"text":"I was very torn on what to give them because the food was pretty good, as well as the drinks! My boyfriend and I went in on a Sunday early afternoon and it wasn't very busy and we sat at the bar. There were two bartenders on, a guy and a girl, both very nice and because it wasn't super busy they were attentive. The only thing is that they both didn't really know anything... I asked about a dish and she said she didn't know, then called to the guy and he didn't know. It was a simple question like how the pork was prepared...pulled? Sliced? I couldn't picture the dish. Then my boyfriend ordered a drink and she said something like..that's the coffee one right? Or something like that. We looked at each other, both in the service industry, and just smiled. Even if you don't know, fake it 'till you make it lol. The drink tasted fine, so if she wouldn't of said anything, we would've never known she didn't know what she was doing. Lol but all in all they were nice and friendly, maybe just some extra training would do the trick. I'd probably come back and check things out again! :)"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for lunch at 6 degrees having been tasked with finding something new, with good reviews, and outdoor seating.  The patio has a well designed outdoor feel while still part of the overall restaurant and mostly tables are in the shade.  Our server promptly welcomed us and asked if anyone was ready to place a drink order which was quickly followed by our drinks.  The iced tea was quite good and refreshing on this fine 10 degree above normal November day (I will be sure to bring this up during this afternoon's conference call with my Chicago team as they complain about the near freezing weather).  Lunch was served quickly however the follow up condiments were not but at the end of our meal the waitress offered fresh refills in to go cups so these equaled out in my book.  Despite the temptations of the daily specials I was set on a Cuban sandwich once I spotted the menu offering and glad I did.  The pork had a deep flavor and a pulled pork consistency that could only come with lot of experience in the kitchen, probably the best I've had and made the sandwich which also featured great bread and cheese.  I would order this again except I would select a side other than fries which were served undercooked and oily, I was not set on having fries so I decided not to bring this to our waiters attention.   Lunch crowd was mostly business folks talking business but I'm guessing there is a lively after work crowd."}
{"text":"Great place...atmosphere, great bar, wonderful food & wine and nice people....outside patio awesome. You will come back...."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in to check out this new restaurant and were pleasantly surprised!  The decor is great, modern and cozy!  The service was excellent. We were there for happy hour, they have a great selection of wines. The food was Amazing!  I think it may be the best burger in town!  The burger is served with a bacon jam that is to die for!  We also sampled the Chicken Satay, and it was excellent, moist and seasoned to perfection. What a nice surprise!  Check it out."}
{"text":"We chose this place for lunch on the first day of our vacation. Great patio, decent drink menu, food came out fast, and servers were friendly. My husband and I started with a cheese board (would recommend but ask for extra bread) and then he had the chicken chowder soup (huge portion) and I had the shrimp Caesar salad. Both entrees were good lunch choices.   The place was empty when we were there but I bet when it gets crowded the atmosphere is fun. Seems like a good place for lunch, happy hour, or just drinks!"}
{"text":"I had a business meeting at 6 Degrees on Friday and had a great experience.  I have liked the past two restaurants that had been in the space, so was hoping the streak would continue.  We had a nice table on the patio since it was a beautiful 80+ degree day.  I enjoyed a meatloaf grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and loved it; however, the portion was so big that I took half of it home to enjoy later.  It tasted just as good the second time around too...bonus!  Nice atmosphere and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place. I have been several times already and it's because the food is amazing. Their Salmon dish is literally the best I've ever had and several of my friends say the same thing. They have reasonable prices and good sized portions with a happy hour that beats everything else. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"6 Degrees Urban Kitchen recently opened in the spot where Alma was in Gainey Village. They offer Lunch, Brunch, Craft Cocktails and Dinner. Outside is a cozy patio and inside is comfortable seating. It's dark wood, a busy bar and a mix of tables and booths.   Our server Brandon was helpful, friendly and well versed on the menu and was able to answer any questions we had.  It was difficult selecting an appetizer because many things did sound a little different and delicious. We decided to start with the Smoked Salmon Rillette. It was very tasty. It seemed less oily and less smoked than others I tried but it was tasty. The Rillete came with a nice assortment of toppings such as pickled mustard seeds. pesto, creme fraiche, pickled onions and toasted bread. It was a nice start.  For dinner I had the Halibut. I was a little nervous about ordering Halibut because it's a non-forgiving fish and half the time I order it out it's over cooked. I'm happy to say my halibut was moist and flaky. I really liked the pea puree with fresh peas it came with. The pea puree was nicely flavored and the whole peas added an interesting texture and popped in the mouth. My plate also contained colorful fingerling potatoes with creamy centers.   My husband had the Porchetta and it was served over soft grits, topped with peach tomato relish and candied bacon. My husband said the candied bacon with really different and interesting. It might have had sesame seeds and cinnamon in it! My husband liked the dish but he thought it had too much peach tomato relish on it for his taste.  We were both very happy that all the food taste good and everything was also technically good. That doesn't happen all the time especially from new restaurants.  This restaurant is a nice addition to the Gainey Village Area. It's located behind Pomo."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas party here.  The food and service was very good. We mostly ordered halibut and steak. They screwed up a few things but nothing catastrophic. Overall it was a very good experience. We'd probably go back again."}
{"text":"First time here....chicken tortilla soup and grilled cheese....an old fashion cocktail.  Was leery because had been here when someone else owned under a different name.    Today was perfect, tortilla soup was a cup of soup I could have eaten a huge bowl of it;). The grilled cheese perfect!  Old fashion cocktail was anazing  I'll return for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy place.  Try the roasted cauliflower as an appetizer, steak frites, great salmon.  Fun cocktails, nice wine and beer menu.  The outside seating is beautiful with fire pits, comfy seating."}
{"text":"LOVE This place. Traveling in the area and stopped in for a bite to eat and a drink. Kori at the bar was so incredibly helpful and friendly and so proud of how well this new restaurant has been received in the last 9 weeks since opening.   After rave reviews from 2 other groups of customers at the bar I made the decision to order the crispy pork belly tacos. Kori let me know that out of 50+ other restaurants and food trucks, their tacos won at a recent taco contest.  Literally the best pork belly I've had (crispy - as all pork belly should be in my opinion)  and some of the best tacos as well.  It came with a side so I chose the soup which was just enough and full of ridiculous amount of flavor. It was the chicken tortilla soup.   Highly recommend this new restaurant whether you are just visiting town or live around the corner!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the setting on the patio, an Urban oasis! Indoor bar area very nice as well. Everyone loved their cocktails. I enjoyed the bourbon smash myself! (6Â° UK has hand selected bourbon barrels from Knob Creek) Shrimp ceviche was fresh and delicious. We loved the Barbacoa and the chicken tacos. Very moist and flavorful. The wait staff folks were super nice and personable. We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere loved the patio seating outdoors with the tv. Good for watching games outside. Worst part was took a while to get coffee and food, Eggs benedict was okay but overpriced for $16. Side of Potatoes with other dish were very good. Bacon could have been crispier. Took about 20 minutes to get our coffee when we got there. The \"creamer\" was milk that was brought out and was bad when poured into our coffee.  Got a new \"creamer\" which was milk but not creamer. Server wasn't checking on us to see how we were doing. Other people working there did however mostly by the person making the water refills. Overall if you're going to serve breakfast you should have creamer for coffee not milk. Service overall was slow taking about 30 minutes to get food considering they were not busy. Also took time to get check after done with food. Would love to go back but for how slow the service was not sure if we would go back for having a total of $36 for breakfast and for how long it took to get the coffee should have been taken off our bill..."}
{"text":"Food was great. Server was very accommodating to my wife's needs. A bit pricey but it is Scottsdale and a bit loud on the patio but they do have indoor setting that was not as crowded."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I had pleasant experience for dinner out on the heated patio. It was not super busy but there was still a lively atmosphere. The service was superb at the beginning but definitely slowed towards the end of the meal. We ordered the mussels to start and I felt they were a bit chewy and the sauce mostly tasted of vinegar. However, we both enjoyed our entrees. The watermelon salad was juicy and flavorful and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I loved the pear martini as well...very light and delicious! Overall this place is a good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time to 6 degrees. My drink (Paloma) was delicious and the service was fast and friendly.  The food was nothing to write home about (we had the chicken yakitori, brushetta, and shrimp and grits).  I'll probably give it another try and hope my choices this first time just weren't the best things on the menu.  Really probably 3.5 stars and will update appropriately after I give the food another shot."}
{"text":"Here are the good points. The atmosphere and service was great, the patio is the best in the area. Here is the bad, the food is mediocre at best, but priced like it is fine dining. Sadly, we won't be going back for that reason."}
{"text":"Really good little restaurant! 5 spice salmon is outstanding! The fish was cooked perfectly was served piping hot and the seasonings were delicious. Worth every penny.  -We really wanted the cauliflower small plate but they were out. Boo. -The mussels had a tasty broth but were a little gritty. For $16 I'd skip them next time.  -We ordered the house frites instead of the cauliflower and while it's not something we usually order they were fantastic. Not super healthy but that's ok! The runny egg on top added a richness and should not be skipped! -Grilled pineapple margarita was well made and I'd order it again as well. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour so the menu was limited but what we had was excellent.   The burger with bacon jam was perfectly cooked.  I would have lived more bacon jam and suspect I will dream of that stuff.   Also had the truffle fries which were good.   The pineapple margarita was pretty strong but the waitress had it toned down for me.   She was very sweet and attentive. If we had more time in the area we would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited the recently opened 6 Degrees for the first time today - nice Saturday afternoon lunch with friends. We were surprised to literally be the only customers in the restaurant for most of the meal but once the word gets out about the good quality, tasty food, attentive service and conscientious management I suspect that will change. Salmon salads, steak salads and pork belly tacos all got 2 thumbs up. And the cinnamon toast creme brÃ»lÃ©e was the perfect finale. Good luck to them- it's a competitive restaurant market where only the strongest survive. . Hope they make it!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night and loved every bit of it!  I started  with the cauliflower appetizer and then the shrimp and grits.  Both were delicious!   I can't talk about it enough and wish my stay in Scottsdale was longer so I could try all their dishes.  The owners were down to earth and very gracious. The staff made us feel like we were old friends.  It was the best meal and experience I've ever had while in Scottsdale.  It's highly recommended!  Thank you 6 Degrees for taking pride in your restaurant and providing excellent food and service!!"}
{"text":"This review has been summarized as I personally don't enjoy reading in-depth opinions on restaurants. I've pretty much copied the same format as ZAGAT & Michelin uses.   Ambiance = 3/5 Food = 1/5 Service = 4/5 Cost = 3/5"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and HH. Fries were good, one of our burgers was improperly cooked, the other burger did not have everything it was supposed to per the menu and neither were very good to begin with. Ordered a gluten free bun and the burger came on a bagel instead, without prior notice. Did not finish food. We got charged for two full priced items instead one of them being on the HH menu. Had to wait even longer to have them fix the bill. Upon leaving we noticed they didn't give HH prices on the drinks. Money isn't the biggest issue however, when several items are put in at a higher price than they're supposed to it's unfair to customers. Waitress was nice but not accessible during the very slow afternoon. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Nice patio and great service. Food was fine...wouldn't race back for dinner. If you want to grab a drink or watch a game and hang out, this is nice place to do it."}
{"text":"As I sit here at the bar at the newly named restaurant, I wonder why it changed. The previous place was my go-to Friday lunch spot, being an office owner in Gainey Ranch. I've sat at the bar for 40 minutes waiting for a chicken sandwich. Everything I eat and drink should be comped. Nobody has said a thing. Apparently this is the norm for this place. I will not return, sadly.  Edited: Just left and not a meaningful word from anybody about the service. On top of that, the food was very mediocre. I honestly can't remember the last time I've had this terrible of an experience at a restaurant.  Whoever wrote the first review for this place: it reads like an advertisment. Take it down. Quit embarrassing yourselves."}
{"text":"We stopped  in this restaurant to grab a drink on Saturday around midday. The restaurant was empty with exception of 2 couples sitting in booths.  The brunch menu was available so we decided to share some chilaquiles verdes and mimosas. The brunch special included 1 bottle of champagne and 4 mixers for $16, it was a great deal! Our food arrived very promptly after ordering. The food was delicious, the chips were crispy and light. The meat was tender and the sauce was perfect. They also put a unique spin on it by adding pickled onions, which complemented all the flavors in this dish. This restaurant is definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This place is relaxed and unassuming!  The service was great.  Atmosphere was laid back but trendy.  The food was stellar!!!  Halibut was excellent!  PurÃ©e, potatoes were perfect.  Prime rib and asparagus were perfect.  Try the cheesecake!  You won't regret the calories!"}
{"text":"6 degrees has a beautiful patio and the service was great, but the food wasn't. I had the pork belly tacos and they just weren't good. They lacked any type of flavor and wasn't worth the price. The plate came with three small tacos. I ate two because I was hungry but I really couldn't bear to eat the third one. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a place that I had never been to for an evening drink. We sat outside at the bar! I ordered a couple of glasses of rosÃ©. The clientele seems to be an older crowd. Overall, there is nothing special or memorable or really anything to say about this place. With so many great restaurants and bars in Scottsdale, they do not seem to have anything that made them stand out from the crowd and make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! There have been two other restaurants in this location over the past year or so. Finally someone has gotten it right!!!! Amazing food, great ambiance, and impeccable service. Stopped for drinks and a late night snack on the way home and ended up coming back for brunch the next morning. Possibly the best breakfast we've ever had.  Don't miss their happy hour. The drinks are already inexpensive on the regular menu ($10 for all craft drinks, very well made, and larger than expected) but  during happy hour they're ridiculously inexpensive. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic. It's a great place to eat some good food and hang out."}
{"text":"Dinner the other night at this new restaurant was totally worth it, and we will be back to try other things.  Fun cocktail list - roasted pineapple margarita was terrific!  Skirt steak delicious and paired with a great chimichuri; the duck is marvelous. The lobster risotto was good, but could have had a bit more flavor and lobster.  Shrimp and grits very, very good.  The cauliflower appetizer I'll do again.  Finally, the salmon sandwich was outstanding.  The only downer were the fries - wide planks that weren't deep-fried long enough and were flacid.  Really interesting breakfast menu will bring us back to try that."}
{"text":"I randomly came across this spot because my boyfriend and I were looking for a comfortable dog friendly patio. We were able to sit around a cozy fire pit with our 2 dogs. Our waiter Rueben was very kind and offered us water bowls for the boys. To our surprise the food was so delicious! We ordered mussels to start and split the burger that had bacon and a fried egg. Super yum! (Our pups loved the fries) Thanks for the great service Rueben!"}
{"text":"I come in here often throughout the week for lunch. Kori is absolutely amazing! She has offered so many food and drink options to try. They always pair fantastic and she is such a sweetheart! I have talked about this place to many of my friends and family and tell them they have to come and try it themselves."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family.  The outside patio is shaded and comfy.  The salads were fresh and the burgers came with bacon-jelly that was delicious!  I'm definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Fabulous new restaurant in Scottsdale with a very innovative menu and a comfortable and inviting ambience."}
{"text":"All I have to say is disappointed. This place is trying to stand out in the wrong way. Your over sugared ketchup and over sugared ranch were not good. The sangria on their speciality cocktail list was pre batched and tasted like cheap red wine on ice. Disgusting. The pineapple margarita was nothing to write home about, luckily the 2nd bartender remade it and it tasted much better. The happy hour menu was poor...$6 for \"truffle\" fries sorry guys but there was not an ounce of truffle oil on my entire order! Lobster roll = not good and the sugar ranch didn't help. The burger is what my brother had and that was awful as well, I had chunks of hard ground meat in my teeth and the jam that was on it took all the flavor away from the meat.   Overall our party of three all agreed that we did not like the restaurant nor the vibe. Sorry 6 degrees, I work in this industry and I'm being kind on this review and leaving several details out regarding service and overall vibe. I'm biting my tongue at this point. Village Tavern is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better"}
{"text":"Recently had the pleasure of dining here when relatives came into town. First, ambiance was way cool and chill. Had a very inviting interior. The patio looks phenomenal!! It should be a great place to hang out when the weather cools down a little. The food was the star of the day. Two at the table had the salmon and raved how delicous it was!! Both plates were licked clean. Haha. I had the burger with the fried egg on top, and it was off the hook. Juicy and flavorful. The little one at the table had the  grilled chicken and wolfed it all down. This from a very picky little girl. We had the pleasure of speaking with the owners who were interacting with the diners in the dining room. That's a huge plus in my book. So often ownership isn't out front taking ownership. Excellent overall experience.  We already have date night planned for this month."}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience at this beautiful restaurant . The most fabulous chef; Jose Morales came to our table to accommodate our specific gluten and allergy issues.  . Such a fabulous menu , many wonderful choices , we had the delicious  salmon and  halibut entrees. Our waiter ; Ruben was knowledgeable  and so very personable ! This place is definitely on my list for \"best restaurants\" for the year ! We enjoyed the music and sitting at our table in the outdoor area , can't wait to come back  !"}
{"text":"I love going to 6 Degrees Urban Kitchen! The food is delicious and plated beautifully and the staff is friendly as well as fast! My last visit I had the Southwest Steak Salad and it was incredible! I highly recommend getting it! The FrosÃ© All Day cocktail is so good and looks so pretty with an edible flower on top! If you go in keep an eye out for Kori Koether, she's a very sociable and fun loving bartender! She'll make you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and had 2 different experiences. The 1st time I had the cauliflower appetizer it was very good. The vegetable was very crisp and the sauce was perfectly balance. The last time it was soggy cauliflower sort of boiled with an overwhelming Mai Ploy sauce.   The 1st order of shrimp and grits featured several large crisp grit cakes, and large shrimp.  This time there was one soggy cake and tiny shrimp.  I ordered a jalapeno  Margarita,   Which was really excellent the 1st time. This time there was no salt on it as I had requested and it was entirely too spicy.  Burger was gritty and dry..   Service sucked as well.  What happened?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty chic. Very cool vibes, good food and great drinks. The service is absolutely wonderful. I had Bree as a waitress and she was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. I can recommend this place with absolute confidence. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but service wss not! My omelete was excellent! my husband ordered chilaquiles and was also excellent!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 8.  Server was great and food was on point.  A little pricey but what the hell isnt these days?  Raise the min wage some more so I can pay $50 for a meal, please?  Decor was nice and it's actually a pretty casual spot.  Martinis were good.  Beer selection could use some work.  Fairly run of the mill selections.  Keep up the good work 6 degrees!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This  place is in a wonderful location but the food was terrible. We stopped there because we were unable to get into the Hash Kitchen which is excellent. We ordered a cobb salad and were asked if we wanted protein as it usually comes with chicken or turkey we said no. No chicken or turkey just a salad with blue cheese and bacon. Also ordered a hamburger this was ok. I asked for ranch and it was so watered down you could not taste it.  The inside was all dark at 11:30 am as we sat on the patio.Only four of us total in there. I won't be going back. The menu was very limited with about twelve items on it."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick mimosa and snack after shopping. We got a bottle of cava for the table and the green pork chilaquiles verdes to share. Our waiter was very nice, he brought over one of each flavor of juice so we could make mimosas and the chilaquiles were delicious. Good flavor, warm the chips were crispy and not soggy at all."}
{"text":"I went for Craft Taco Tuesday.  I had the Adobo Pork Tacos with Lemon Cured Onions, Chipotle Crema, Cotija, Sour Orange, Cilantro.  Yeah, they were as good as they sound.  The chef is doing amazing things at this place, and he's doing them his way. To top it off, the service couldn't be beat.  My server also had a party of 18, but she still made time to take care of her 1 top.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Went on taco night and they were outstanding . Good drink selection as well. Friendly bartender, was really knowledgeable about menu."}
{"text":"Our favorite new brunch location! We love Hash Kitchen but hate the wait that is required there and Eggstacy has disappointed the last two visits--saw the sign, looked 6 Degrees Urban Kitchen up and were intrigued by their brunch menu.  My husband ordered a basic breakfast --the scrambled eggs were really eggs, not watered down eggs (many places add milk or water or even pancake mix to \"extend\" the eggs) and the fingerling smashers were cooked exactly was we ordered them--cripsy without being overcooked and ruined.  And 3 slices of bacon, not 2 like many places.  Substituted the Captain Crunch pancake for toast--fun idea--probably not something we would order regularly, but the kids will go crazy for it.  His coffee was good (we drink it black--there is no hiding bad coffee).  I had a grapefruit mimosa--bartender got the mix perfect so it was not too much juice and not too much champagne.  I had the omelette with mushrooms and goat cheese--perfect balance of all ingredients--not too much of any of them and generous enough serving I brought the leftovers home.   We talked to the chef who came out to see how our meal was and I asked about adding protein to the chilaquiles as I love chilaquiles normally but need protein.  He explained that there is a pork green chili with them and brought out a sample to try--amazing!!  Perfect blend of flavor and heat and I will be going back for that!  He then went in back and brought me out some to take home.   I can't wait to go back and try lunch, dinner and happy hour--if it is anything like brunch, this will be our new favorite spot in our area to eat!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour this past Friday in a group of nine. Food was delicious, service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Terrible Mothers Day. $400+ bill for 7 people. No warning it would be a buffet when making the reservation. The brunch menu online is a scam for Mother's Day. Initial seating was in full sun. Who sits a 90 yr old grandmother in full sun in Phoenix? Watress was nice and friendly. The only thing good. Sausages at the buffet were cold. Bacon was stale. The had a omelet station that was half stocked. Oh, bottomless mimosa for $10, if you ever find someone to refill it. We paid $40 per person plus additional drinks. Whowever owns this place loves $$ way more than moms. Overall mediocre food. Dennys would have been way better. Never going back. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"A fabulous new hip and trendy place in Scottsdale!! Excellent food.. welcoming staff. A must when coming to scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great vibes and a cool atmosphere.  The food is outstanding, the drinks are fabulous, just an all around sweet experience.  The staff is great too, Ryan's my favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Pork belly tacos for lunch are simply amazing. Wish they wouldn't use styrofoam for takeout orders."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night.  Good crowd, sat out on the back patio. Place had a nice ambiance.  Food was pretty good.  Had a beet salad and the crispy duck.  My wife had the halibut.  What impressed me most was the service actually.  Our server (and the kitchen) were able to easily accommodate some dietary adjustments we requested.  They even replaced a cream-based lemon sauce with sautÃ©ed lemon reduction without even asking us, since we had specified that we couldn't eat dairy.  Appreciate the attention to detail!"}
{"text":"Brittany made our experience unforgettable.  We had crispy cauliflower and the pork chop special.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  Drinks were phenomenal.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had dinner and appetizers at this restaurant while visiting Scottsdale for Spring Training. We are from Napa, so we know a little about wine and food. This place was fantastic, from the yakitori appetizer And cauliflower app for starters and our main courses of Lobster risotto which was nice and creamy and my wife's shrimp and grits it was top notch. Atmosphere is great with a nice outside patio and plenty of TVs to enjoy sports, my kind of place. Highly recommend visiting as you won't be disappointed! Service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"Cool build out and an amazing patio. The whole area is up and coming big time. This is place is new and for a first impression they nailed it. Awesome service. The food is amazing from what we had. Best Cauliflower example I have ever seen. The presentation in general is spot on. We had the Guacamole, Cauliflower, Soup de Jour (mushroom amazingness), Pear Salad, Lobster Risotto, and Braised Greens. Make sure you ask for LT when you get here. He welcomes all with open hands and love. The guy is great. This easily is now the best restaurant in this complex with about 6 restaurants surrounding. Thank you for stepping the game up in this area."}
{"text":"I have been here three times before my Friday afternoon visit. If I had never eaten here, I would have given it 1 star, but, the food and their Happy Hour are good. I walked in the door at 1:07 pm for lunch. There wasn't any hostess, which is no big deal as being by myself I went to eat at the bar, which is where we always eat when possible.   There was probably four tables full of people inside and a couple of more outside on the patio. There wasn't anybody working behind the bar, but I assumed somebody would see me sitting at the bar and come over and wait on me or request that I sit at a table.   This was not a casual \"in the neighborhood\" visit. I drove from the DMV in   North Scottsdale because I wanted to get their crispy cauliflower and their strawberry salad, both quite good.   It was lunch, I didn't have time to kill. At 1:15, I slowly ambled towards the front door and stopped for a couple of moments at the hostess desk. After almost ten minutes with no acknowledgment I was there, I left and went to Village Tavern."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best burgers in town. Excellent service too. My server was on top of her game the entire time. My drink glass was never empty."}
{"text":"The food is good for brunch, but the service was horrible. It was not even busy and still the service was awful. They need to work on customer service"}
{"text":"Came here on a happy hour and the drinks are fantastic! Hubby and I are not into sweet drinks so we got the Bourbon Smash and Cherry Vanilla Manhattan.  Perfectly mixed with the right amount of liquor. We got: House Frites (good amount to make it a meal) Chicken something - sorry forgot the name (from the HH menu) and Brie Melt.  All three were very tasty!! Staff were attentive. I accidentally knocked over my glass...idiot. The waiter was very quick to assess the situation and cleaned it up swiftly as he was hearing me apologize profusely. Ugh still cant believe I did that. Go give this place a try. I know we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Relaxing spot in North Scottsdale; service was quick and on point. Charcuterie board is fantastic, would recommend."}
{"text":"Came early at 4pm.  While nearby Pomo's parking lot is already filled, there's almost no one here.  Bad sign.  It seems the ones here are here for happy hour.  Guacamole appetizer included chips from a bag, not understanding if you're going to do guacamole why not do the chips as well-or drop it.  Her burger and fries were good, cooked as ordered.  A burger.  The soft grits side dish was really good-and very hot.  A plus.  My roasted artichoke pasta included cauliflower, asparagus, pine nuts, pasta, some kind of cream sauce...but no artichokes.  Zero.  Another reviewer said the place was recently remodeled.  It looks old and feels...sticky.  And parts of it smelled of sewer gas.  Won't return."}
{"text":"If they had 1/2 star, I would chose that. First drink Sangria wa HORRIBLE, second drink Pineapple Margarita HORRIBLE, 3rd drink remade Pineapple Margarita FINALLY made correct from another bartender. Truffle fries..McDonald's better!! Burger..just ok. I will not be back..too many GOOD places around the area. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"We just had a friends holiday get together at 6 Degrees and all I can say is every single person enjoyed themselves. Everyone enjoyed their food. Everyone loved their drinks. Our server Ivette was so lovely. I don't have enough great things to say. I highly recommend checking them out"}
