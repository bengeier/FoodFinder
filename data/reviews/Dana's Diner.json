{"text":"Dana's has become our favorite breakfast / brunch stop in the entire area. The service is always prompt even when they're extremely busy, the food is excellent, large portioned, lot's of choices, and priced lower than most other breakfast restaurants.  Who could ask for more than that?  The Americana decor with cars and antiques is a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"I love little diners like this that are \"the family way.\" The staff just take good care of you like you're a neighbor. My breakfast was nothing fancy - I wasn't looking for fancy, I was looking for a great plate of eggs, hashbrowns & sausage (scrapple, yay!). Guess what? Yup, you are correct - it WAS awesome. You must've eaten here too...   Thanks Dana!"}
{"text":"The place is small town comfy- waitress was very nice.   The food was ...meh...   scrapple was delicious and crisp, but the toast was limp and cold, the home fries are nothing but shredded potatoes with absolutely NO flavor at all and my eggs were undercooked."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to stop for breakfast. The people are friendly and the service is good. Close tot he highway and easy to get to. The coffee never runs out."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch on the road. The service was outstanding and the food was just as great. I ordered chicken salad on homemade bread and a half plate of fries. I also had food envy looking at the plates nearby. I will remember this little gem when I come visit my NY family in the future."}
{"text":"Cute little Mom and Pop diner with a tasty brunch menu and down-home feel. I had a chicken salad sub which was delicious. Bean and ham soup was really good. A very good choice for eats in a remote part of PA if you want to avoid chains. Worth the short drive off US. 15"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service was friendly. It's too bad they're only open until 2pm, or I would stop here every single time I passed it."}
