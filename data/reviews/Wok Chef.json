{"text":"Been here many many times cuz i cant stop haha, the food is really really good trust me if you like seafood then is a must I usually get the \"seafood deluxe\" \"DeepFried Salt&Pepper seafood\" \"XO Shrimp\" and beef ginger green onion etc...is better than most of the restaurant in Markham scarbrough ~"}
{"text":"After hearing many good reviews about Wok Chef we finally decided to give it a try. Although the wait time given was an hour, the yummy food made it up for it. Food was very fresh, good quality & quantity and very tasty. Definitely worth the 10 mins drive from Stouffville for delicious food."}
{"text":"I rated this Chinese Place about a year and a half ago, because the food was amazing, however after my recent order my opinion has changed.  The chicken fried rice had hardly any chicken in it, and the beef and  broccoli, which is my favorite was awful.  Now they seem to be putting carrots in it,  It looked a different color, probably a cheaper cut of meat and had a really different taste to it.  I was not impressed.  The quality was certainly not up to the standards I have come to know from this place.  I won't be going back.  EVER"}

{"text":"Try their signature congee here and it won't let you down. We two girls shared one big bowl of congee and each only paid around five bucks."}
