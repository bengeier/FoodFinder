{"text":"Un lieu insolite a Montréal pour déguster des plats typiques comme la \"poutine\". A voir absolument!"}
{"text":"The Orange Julep is sublime & Best Berger Place in Montreal since I started going there in 1968 - it's been running since about 1934!"}
{"text":"classic staple the orange juice is great and the vibes are unmatched, grab a few hot dogs and a poutine and grab a 2L organge juice for later, good customer service and historic landmark for the city"}
{"text":"Great overall experience. The orange juice there is indeed very good, it is twice more expensive than regular orange in grocery store, but worth every penny of it. It has secret ingredient added to the orange juice, which makes it very tasty and special. Other than the orange juice, the rest of the fast food was so so, and overpriced compared with the average price in Montreal. We also ordered the chicken wings, which was not bad, but not outstanding neither. Tips: just order the orange juice there to try, the medium size is good for a start. The menu is shown with the pictures I took."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Long waits. Overpriced. Don't believe the other reviews! Avoid this dump and you'll save money and eat better.  Fries were soggy and cold, totally falling apart when I tried to eat them with my hands and then turned into mush when I gave in and used a fork. The burger was completely lackluster - it was literally the worst burger I've had. Every fast-food place I can think of makes a better burger. The fake cheese completely enveloped the tiny burgers, the bun was paper-thin and flavourless, and their \"all-dressed\" toppings were practically non-existent. I was literally given a single three inch strip of onion, to put this into perspective. The orange drink was okay, not anything special, and definitely not worth the price they charge.   I went at lunch so there was a bit of a line, but that doesn't explain why I  stood there waiting 10 minutes before ordering. They charged me $1 extra for the bacon on my burger, which is fine but follows an inconsistent logic: their cheeseburger comes with bacon, the double does not. When I got back to my office to eat it, I discovered they had forgotten to put the bacon on the burger at all.   The whole meal cost $13.30, which is about double what it would cost for better quality frozen food from any of the other dozen fast-food burger places around."}
{"text":"Lots of locals here and recommending this place highly.,  food is not so great, and the famous orange dreamsicle drink is the same thing as orange julias back in the states.  Over all, big whoop de doo."}
{"text":"I used to pass in front of Orange Julep wondering what was hidden beneath the notorious orange structure. I finally tried this Montreal landmark a couple of weeks ago. I ordered a hamburger-poutine trio served with their classic orange drink. I was expecting to become fond of their famous orange julep; however it was too sweet for my taste bites. Also, the hamburger was ordinary. Nothing special, just a regular hamburger. The poutine, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. As I am fan of traditional poutines (no extra topics for me), I found their poutine exceptional. Just the right combination of good fries, delicious dark gravy sauce, and cheese kurds. If you are a poutine fan in search of another Montreal establishment offering an amazing version of this traditional dish, Orange Julep should be your next stop."}
{"text":"The Orange julep drink itself scares me.. It comes in from a giant tube of some sort... I don't get it and they won't tell me what's in it. I've tried it and it's mysterious to me still. Heard there was egg whites in it. Pretzels, ice cream, hot dogs (nathans) and burgers and more!!! They serve so much variety! Great dive to bring a picky fast food person. Endless choices."}
{"text":"This is my third time going and always the same thing the fries are dark but not cooked same with the 4 veg pogo 2 drinks ( the only thing that was good )  and 2french fries for 29$ is not cheap considering most of the food was trash .  Poutine is the worst poutine I've ever had in my life and I've had poutinezzzz from poutineVille to the the rest poutine to almost ever whole in the wall . The French fries are horrible, or they just don't change/clean the fryer oil . What ever the problem is I don't see how people love the food when the only thing on the menu that is good is the orange drink and maybe the ice cream ."}
{"text":"Their hotdog is better than the IKEA or costco hotdog. And their juice is better than tropicana or sunny d."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Montreal, I had been meaning to try Orange Julep and see what people were talking about. I finally did and I can see why people love it soo much! First off the poutine was delicious. Secondly the orange julep was the best thing I've ever drank. Although it seems to be a little pricey, it's addictive and tasty in so many ways. I can't quite describe it completely, but the closest I can is a creamsicle with a little more orange juice in it. I will be back for some more!"}
{"text":"A favorite of mine since childhood, orange juice but not just orange juice, it's like orange cream Popsicle in juice form, there perfect description.  I'm totally biased about this place...   When I think of orange julep, I remember the long summer days back when, we would come and hang out in the lot have some orange juice just after dark, it was still warm out with just a little breeze. There would be these young people with their cars, blasting Michael Jackson, beat it and Billie jean, and break dancing, and then you sip some orange julep, and it's like you're in heaven.  I'll have two jugs to go please... :)"}
{"text":"Great place, the orange juice is tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Super déçue :(  J'avais lu dans un article qu'on y était servi à l'intérieur par de jolies serveuses en patin à roulettes, seulement voilà, avant oui, mais plus maintenant.   On se contente de rester dans l'entrée sous une devanture scabreuse où la bouffe laisse fort à désirer, ça reste hot dog, burger et poutine vite faits.   Seul bon point c'est leur fameux jus d'orange comme ça nous l'indique.  Si vous passez devant arrêtez vous mais n'y allez pas exprès"}
{"text":"Super yummy orange juice. Nice juicy old fashion deep fried french fries. A bit on the pricier side but worth a visit now and then because it is a Montreal landmark.  On certain days, they have vintage cars or motorcycles."}
{"text":"The Iconic Montreal Orange is a must !  Like every kitshy awesome thing you'd find on the road, it makes the journey more interesting. Your typical roadside atttraction, the giant orange has a lot to offer. It's a fast food, burger, hotdogs, fries, poutines.... All served with their famous orange juice.  Nobody can figure out what the secret ingredient in the OJ is and sometimes it's just better not to know. :) I think it might be ice cream but no idea... Anyway it's awesome.   The Orange Julep is legend and you have to try it.   Just because it's a restaurant in an orange, not so much because of the food but you need to try the hole concept.  Not more expensive than a McDonald combo and so much more Montreal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. There's a reason it's stood the test of time, and it's because it's the perfect combination of a novelty monument (massive orange sphere) and a delicious independent fast food restaurant. I make it a point to go here whenever I'm in Montreal. The julep is like Orange Julius but better. And the Poutine is some of the best in the city. Yes the food is greasy... That's the appeal! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came by with a friend for a midnight snack on a Thursday night. What a great atmosphere! The entire lot was flooded by bikers and in the back, there were groups of perfectly grown men playing with remote-controlled cars. There was ample seating and after my friend and I got our food, we sat outside on one of the benches.   We bought hotdogs, cheeseburgers, poutine, and of course, the orange juice. Everything was delicious-- fast food but a classic kind. The food, the drive-in, the people: the whole experience felt like it was pulled right out of the 60s in one of those drive-ins that everyone would go to after work and school.   Quite a commute away from downtown though, but I guess that's part of its charm."}
{"text":"Si vous voyez une très grosse orange à Montréal, ne paniquez pas, c'est normal ! Cette grosse boule orange n'est que le restaurant Orange Julep Gibeau issu de la marque du même nom. La société Gibeau est connue pour son jus d'orange particulier. Je vais essayer de vous décrire ce jus d'orange... Très sucré, un peu crémeux mais pas trop, onctueux, doux, parfois tellement sucré qu'on se dit que ce n'est pas du jus d'orange ! J'ai trouvé ça super bon tout de même et c'est totalement addictif et très désaltérant en été. Et ça m'a fait faire le plein de vitamine C ! Sinon dans ce restaurant ils proposent des plats comme la poutine, des breakfast canadiens avec saucisses et ufs, burgers... Rien de très diététique mais c'est bon quand même. En tout cas c'est à essayer si vous passez à Montréal !"}
{"text":"I give this spot a 5 star because it was beyond what I expected for a fast food hot dog fries kinda spot. First the location is eye catching. The big Orange dome. Second the orange julep drink is very unique. Tastes a lot like those orange popsicles with the cream filling. Never ever had such a unique drink."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed! This place used to have great tasty burgers which used to be delivered to your car by servers on roller skates but those days are over. Went back today after 10 years and cheeseburger was cold even though I picked it up from the stand. Bread was tasteless, so was the meat. I will go so far as saying - no good. The Julep however was the same. Eating in an old, unkept parking lot . Even the the entrance where u place your order looks unkept.....dirty. So many better places to get a burger but so disappointed to see a landmark, that could have stayed great....go down hill and  loose its reputation and quality compared to its hay days.  Ps: watch out for the bees and gulls eyeing your food."}
{"text":"Amazing orange  julep and the best grilled cheese. Lots of fun for the kids."}
{"text":"A legendary place! The Orange Julep is a must-have if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Yep. I'm that jerk that wasn't really into Orange Julep. It's just....OK tasting. Not terrible. But not great. Much more hype behind it than actual flavor. I had been so excited to go here, salivating over the pics on yelp for days. But for the life of me I just can't see what the fuss is about. We ordered the famous julep drink and the hot dogs and basically everything everyone was telling us we just absolutely had to try. And it was all ok. That's literally it. The orange julep had a strange metallic taste to it, and the hot dogs are just bland. That being said, I've definitely had worse. It's something to eat, not much more than that. It tastes just about how you'd expect food you can get immediately off the exit of a freeway to taste. Is this just one of those places everyone loves because everyone keeps talking about how much they love it? Kind of feels like it."}
{"text":"No I sea what they put in their orange juice but dang it's good. Sweet and creamy, no other way to do it!"}
{"text":"Really good veggie pogos. Service can be slow at times but worth the wait. Staff are nice. Could smile i a little more but other than that its good"}
{"text":"Nice place for a hot dog and poutine. Orange Julep is a must. If you want to try a real street food stuff and eat outside you should go there. Not a dinner place. More like lunch but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal to visit an old friend, and he told us we had to try the famous Orange Julep at the giant orange ball.  Well we did, and although it was a great drink, it was pretty much an Orange Julius from back home.  Creamsicle flavored drink.  Thats all we had here, just ate lunch somewhere else and came to sample the famous drink.   Maybe worth a shot if thats your type of pleasure, but nothing I would send a post card to my mom about."}
{"text":"Only had the orange juice which is overly sweet and creamy. Definitely an acquired taste."}
{"text":"Poutine is amazing! The orange juice is very creamy and different!!! You gonna try! Won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"The Orange Julep Gibeau is a Montreal institution, you drive past it on the decarie when you head into Montreal downtown.  We made it a point to stop in before heading to our Montreal downtown hotel.  Their infamous Orange Julep drink is what brings you to the orange ball, then you can enjoy their poutine and hot dogs.  Orange Julep is like an Orange Julius drink but WAY better.  Frothy, creamy with loads of vitamin C.  I recommend getting a XL jug as it is the best value for $10.25.  Next time, we are in Montreal, we might hit up Orange Julep Gibeau before we get to Montreal and we leave Montreal.  This place is definitely 5 star worthy!"}
{"text":"Haven't failed to visit both the times I have been to Montreal. Still remains the best orange juice I have ever tasted! We got the club chicken sandwich and it was amazing as well. I recommend for you to try the orange juice from here when you are in the area!"}
{"text":"There is a difference between the orange juice and the orange frappe (creamier). I like the juice myself, but that is personal preference. Key thing to note! I'm not sure what their special ingredient is, but damn it's delicious.   I'd buy this by the litres if I could. Ah, I'll miss this in Montreal."}
{"text":"Nothing says Montreal like a giant orange overlooking the highway! Overall, its a great place to go if you are feeling a little nostalgic. I believe on Wednesdays many car lovers come and show off their toys. I love the atmosphere and their orange julep is incredible. Their food is not the greatest, kind of greasy confort food, but if you're in the mood for that then go for it! Also, it is dissapointing that you cannot see whats in that giant orange or know the secret ingredients of their famous drink."}
{"text":"I looooooove Orange Julep. Their orange juice is creamy and delicious..and their poutine is amazing. It's 7:37 in the morning and I am craving Orange Julep as I type. Probably why I am writing a review about it right now...good times."}
{"text":"This is the giant orange in the middle of a busy street.  Never tried any food here, but have had their delicious and unique orange julep many times.  Very refreshing, very unique, very yummy!  Imagine a thick orange juice that is somehow extra sweet and almost creamy in texture.  I have yet to taste anything like it.  Still not sure what their secret ingredient is.    A little pricey for just a bit of juice, but you pay a premium for a unique product.  If you haven't met your vitamin C quota for the day, grab a drink here."}
{"text":"U must be kidding.   The drink is water sugar and  very little resemblance of orange juice.  It's a joke"}
{"text":"Amazing spaghetti and garlic bread for very cheap. It's the best sauce I've ever had. Don't know what's in it but amazing food."}
{"text":"This really is one of my favourite places to eat in the entire world. A Montreal staple with my favourite poutine in the city, standard hot dog anywhere, and of course the famous Orange Julep. This place is so iconic and nostalgic that I would probably eat here even if the food wasn't great, but it really is. This place is the one of a kind and if I was a rich man, I would try and make it the Canadian Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Sad to not give this place 5 stars after hearing so much hype from friends, and as everyone's already mentioned the pro's, here are my cons: -SUPER expensive for junk food and the amount of food given -fries are gross and oily/limp and only tasted good smothered in poutine -no indoor seating so if it's windy or cold the eating experience kind of downgrades -bathrooms are groooossssss  Nonetheless, I would come back again for the OJ if it was on the way, but if you're visiting Montreal and don't have a car/are staying downtown, I can't say it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I feel so nostalgic when I drive by this place ...   This place is definitely tucked into one of my earliest memories of Montreal - my birth city!  Well, I had some orange julep gibeau tonight and it was definitely yummy.  It is a sweet, very frothy, slightly creamy orange juice ... a little lighter tasting than the regular orange julius.    This place is special and I hope it stays around forever ... I want my little guy to have memories of this place too :)"}
{"text":"you start off getting the orange drank as part of your meal... one sip and you've crossed over to the dark side! you'll be paying for the $12 quart before you can even finish uttering the words \"crack juice\"  poutine and hot dogs were good too (you will hate yourself after you finish it though)  cheddar stuffed pretzel is just too much, i felt my heart stop a couple of times.  no indoor seating, only outdoor seats available.  in the winter, you will have to eat it in your car or on the go."}
{"text":"Orange Julep Gibeau is possible the best place ever for refreshing orange juice in Montreal! This legendary institution, and the source of many childhood memories, has been serving the freshly-squeezed concoction since the early 1930s. Whether you're local or simply visiting Montreal, it's worth the stop-over."}
{"text":"Never fail to come here at least once every time I hit up Montréal. I've had poutine at many places but this place is still my worth it winner, hands down, no doubt about it.   Their fries just has that perfectly aged diner fryer oil flavour (sounds weird but trust me!), crispy on outside and potato-y on the inside. The size of the cheese curd is perfect, ratio between fries and curd are bang on, and they got that ever so important 'squeak'. My S.O. says the gravy is magical, and that's probably the only time I've ever heard him use that adjective to describe food.  Their orange drink is a must. You cannot go there and not order it. My S.O. prefers the frappé version, but I like the original as is.  Will probably always be my first stop. Thank you for existing Orange Julep!  Food - 5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Atmosphere - okay it's a quick stop place in the middle of a lot so can't really rate this"}
{"text":"Five stars for the mega orange alone. I'm a sucker for novelty restaurants, especially when they come in weird shapes and sizes. I spotted the enormous orange when I flew into MTL and I made it my mission to see it up close.  We came at lunch time on a Saturday. No line. We got hot dogs and orange juleps. Both very tasty. After the meal we asked a waitress to take our picture. She took a bunch, including some at weird angles. Overall, a huge success."}
{"text":"When we were in Montreal eating at the restaurant shaped like a big orange was on our to do list.    I expected more.  Well, actually I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this.    However, we did enjoy the food.  The poutine was good, but the fries could have been cooked longer.  I found that for $22 my daughter and I got more food than we could even dream of eating.  She got the chicken wing meal and I got a hot dog and poutine.  I ate the dog(plain old hot dog), but was too full to eat all the poutine.  My daughter ate her wings, maybe a third of her fries and couldn't get to the slaw.    The highlight... the Orange Julep!  SO YUMMY!  Like a creamsicle in a cup.  I think if we would have made it there before sundown we might have be able to take in the experience of eating outside at picnic tables."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Julep for a while now. I normally get two hotdogs with a poutine and a delicious cup of the Orange Julep. It is a pretty cool spot considering how long this place has been around! I really like that they offer car shows every week, it is nice to see different people within the community.   This used to be my go to place for a hotdog and poutine but I have found that the last few times I have gone that the gravy and hotdogs seem to have taste different than what I remember. It is still good none the less!   I would recommend coming here for lunch! It is a nice area to sit down and grab a bite to eat while watching the traffic zoom by."}
{"text":"The Big O! This was my first time trying  out the Orange Julep - I ordered a medium Julep that had an interesting flavour to it - I definitely tasted the freshly squeezed oranges in the midst of more of a milkshake feel. I enjoyed it! But I expected more of an ice cream feel.   The prices were $, offering combos with hot dogs, burgers, fries - the usual. The wait time is short- and they do accept all forms of payment. Transport is a bit more of an issue- if you don't own a car.  Grab a Julep during a classic car showcase in their parking lot! A true Montreal icon to put on the bucket list."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this orange shaped joint to try the orange juice! I had heard such great reviews and I can see why. The orange juice is fresh and light -- it's not as acidic as regular orange juice so it's easy to drink a full cup without feeling the sugary taste of regular orange juice.   They have quite the comprehensive menu for food as well like burgers and hotdogs but let's be clear that they're known for their orange juice, not the food.   I would definitely return and wish I had ordered a large orange juice instead of a medium."}
{"text":"During warmer days (or rather evenings), this place is bustling. It kinda reminds me of that show \"Happy Days\": teens of every level of puberty, tattooed bearded leathery guys on motorcycles, dudebros in muscle cars. Music, mosquitoes, and hormones. Quite nostalgic.   Well tonight wasn't one of those nights. It was a cold autumn eve, the big orange ball was attached to one of those indoor enclosures, the benches were empty, and there were maybe 7 cars in the parking lot. The dog days of November, when snow could arrive any moment, and \"ain't nobody got time for that!\"  Well, I missed me some Orange Julep. It was one of the first \"welcome to Montreal\" places my friends took me to when I first visited. And for this one brisk evening, I figured why not.   The poutine here is good when it wants to be, and the orange julep is one of those beverages that you drink endlessly but probably don't wanna ask what it's made out of. I also usually get a hot dog all dressed, and while I don't quite understand putting hot dogs inside folded slices of bread (as opposed to... hot dog buns!), it actually tastes just fine. In fact, the bread is a little on the grilled/crispy side, which is a pleasant change.   All in all, Orange Julep is a historical establishment that keeps it simple and old school. But for the total experience, better to come through during the summer."}
{"text":"I have no idea how people can rate this place as four star! the Orange juice they offer is made from cheap powder...the Poutine is terrible and you always have to wait a long time in a crowded and noisy place beside the highway!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to grab some good fast burgers or hot dogs! Very easy and classic comfort food. Simple menu and decent prices.  I have to say I personally love the orange julep itself. I wouldn't say it's for everybody but I was lucky enough to love it! The price used to be cheaper but obviously now it would go up because it's more popular.   If you're visiting Montreal from out of town or anywhere you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Whether you want to get a sugar high with the yummy original orange julep, or stop the heart with a classic poutine, you gotta try to orange julep.  A fun casual little eatery with great food. I don't know how folks can drink a whole medium sized orange julep.  I had a small, and loved it, but it was sooooo rich. The poutine was perfection.  Lots of gooey cheese curds, rich tasty gravy and the requisite frites.  The hamburger was a good basic dish with lots of 'stuff' packed inside.  Basic but good."}
{"text":"Le jus d'orange est le classique, la poutine est délicieuse. Souvenirs d'enfance, un must à Montréal"}
{"text":"It's hard to miss the bulbous orange ball beside walmart on decarie, which is none other than the Orange Julep.  This restaurant is known for their orange juleps, which are really like a melted dreamsicle in a styrofoam container.  However they are also a notable greasy spoon as well, additionally serving all dressed hamburgers, hotdogs, poutine, etc.  The prices aren't too bad either, you can get two people out the door, each with a burger, fries and julep combo for a total of $20 or less.  Parking is in a private lot, and while indoor seating is limited, there are picnic tables outside.  If no seating options are available, conveniently all orders are given take out style.  ~Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic orange julep and poutine (given the type of place). I liked the large orange structure and quirkiness of the whole thing. It was a little windy and cold as fall is well underway but we found the outside seating to be fine. Major downside is that the julep and poutine seems a bit overpriced. Expect to pay $5-8 for a medium/large julep drink."}
{"text":"I came in on a random Sunday afternoon just before Christmas. There was nobody else in sight, which was not a bad thing as there is only one picnic table available inside during winter.   They cooked my fries to order, topped with fresh curds (not always that easy to find), smothered with a thick rich brown gravy. Price tag a bit much at $9 for a small appetizer type poutine, but it was taassstttyyyy.   Weirdness of the orange ball thing aside, maybe it's a tourist trap but I'll take my out of town friends for a poutine there before La Belle Pro any day.   P.S. Use your GPS to find it. Not the easiest place to get to. P.P.S. They take US dollars at par."}
{"text":"Gotta give this old gem 5 stars for being my go to location for junk food! They also have, in my opinion, the best poutine in the city - take that to the bank!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and i absolutely love it! You must definitely try the orange juice, you won't get that anywhere else. The first time i went i had the Poutine, orange  juice and a hot dog (yes i was hungry!) The Poutine was good, but the hot dog was quite small. The second time i also had the Poutine and the orange juice but tried the roast beef sandwich instead and it was really good! Its great that their open really late so you can always grab a late night meal!"}
{"text":"Novelty at its finest. Place is packed all the time. Diner style; housed inside a giant orange dome.   They are supposed to have some magical pricey orange juice. Was nothing special. I got the frappe and it had ice cream in it. Was better then the regular one. Poutine was awesome; however it was really pricey.  I guess its good to get a genuine MTL experience"}
{"text":"This took me back to my childhood so fast. If you're from the US and old enough to remember orange Julius then you will instantly be transported back when you drink an orange julep. And to add the building is shaped like a huge orange which def brings out the kid in you. The julep is pretty sweet so we split one but you can taste the fresh squeezed OJ and cream in it. Kind of like drinking a melted orangesicle we had a hotdog and fries and they were standard greasy pickup window food but not bad. Would def visit here every time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Wow! So finally I can say I've had an orange juice from Orange Julep, haha. Aaaaaand it did not hit a home run! My first sip of the juice was a jolt, as I was expecting freshly squeezed orange juice and that's it, no additives. Orange Julep's version,however, is clearly doctored with a LOT of added sugar. Now, I like sugar, don't get me wrong. I've even been accused of liking too much sugar at times. HOWEVER, when you advertise that your juice is made from fresh Sunkist oranges and don't write anything else, AND you charge $5 for a medium cup that's more like a larger small (and have the audacity to charge $12.50 for the gallon or whatever largest size that is), I expect freshly squeezed orange juice and that's it. God knows how many grams of sugar are in those size mediums.....Ugh. It really is like they dumped a bunch of pixie sticks into the drink!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows when you come here you must try the orange drink It was pretty tasty. If you're hungry, I would recommend the hot dog or the fried fish.  Nothing exciting about the food though.  Good prices for packaged meals where you get burger/hot dog, side of fries and a medium julep drink. You can also upgrade to poutine fries but I wouldn't recommend getting them here. There are much better places to get poutine."}
{"text":"Insanely amazing orange drink. Words cannot describe. If you are nearby you must get here! Lined up for about 15 mins and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The most delicious orange juice I've ever had. It had this creamy kick to it. Food wasn't so great. Had the poutine which was good but the grilled cheese was simple."}
{"text":"Orange Julep is a Montreal staple, for good reason. What they serve is classic. Their hot dogs are just full of beefy, juicy flavour. Their signature orange drink..who could go wrong with that? It never disappoints! But the prices..ouff..the prices hurt. 10.99$ for 2 steamies, a fry and a drink? RIDICULOUS. It is so over priced. I hate going to a place KNOWING I'm being scammed. I don't enjoy myself."}
{"text":"YOU MUST COME HERE!  Locals, this is your birthright! :D  Tourists, please add this to your itinerary!!! This is not just some \"juice\" from oranges.  It is a food orgasm that you must experience!  So many ways to describe this drink!  Smooth, creamy, frothy, easy on the sweetness, a way to quench your thirst - you think you only want a small - but order a medium at the least.   It's kind of like drinking an orange float?  Best bet is to buy a jug and share (if you dare lol) - they will give you small cups too.  Saw on the menu that they have it in milkshake form too!  Will try next time.  This place also serves fast food.  The fries are good there.  Typical fast food - pogos, poutine, hot dogs, spaghetti, even breakfast options...etc.  If don't want to eat there, then take your drink and cross the street to the McDonald's.  This has always been a tradition for us, especially in the summer months.  They are opened year-round and most of the time 24 hours.  In the colder months, there is a \"gazebo\" like covering with entrances on both sides.  There is plenty of parking.  On certain days of the week, there are sometimes \"car shows\" where owners display their American car muscle.  If that's not enough, just taking a selfie in front of the big ol' orange is instagram-worthy.    Do advise the cashier if you have any allergies as you never know what is in their \"secret\" recipe - as it may just not be the obvious oranges and sugar.  ENJOY!!! :D AND....it's a POKEMON STOP!"}
{"text":"For a really long time, I didn't know this was a restaurant. I thought it was just an orange ball for fun. When I finally realized it was a orange juice place, I never thought I would go because I hate orange juice. But I just had to try it at least once. It's famous here in Montreal.   I got the poutine and the hot dogs. It's good comfort food. It's very enjoyable to eat here, you can just eat and people watch.  I think it would be more fun to go here if I had a car and my driver's license though. Otherwise, I have to take public transportation and that's definitely not as fun."}
{"text":"I live close and have been a few times but it is more bells and whistle then substance. It's typical potato shack food with a twist of adding a funky orange drink with some kind of cream which is a hit or miss, people either love it or completely dislike it. I personally do not like the drink but I know some people who love it. It could be a nice late night summer place with all the hyped up cars in the yard it's impressive"}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing like Orange Julep anywhere! If you've flown in to Montreal, you might have noticed that huge Orange along the highway...and that's where you'll want to end up. This is a drink that is fruity, frothy, and delicious! It may look like plain ol' O.J. but you'd be wrong, it is a mix of fresh squeezed orange juice and some secret ingredient (my guess is powdered egg whites). Mixed together it makes a magical potion that you'll never forget. I am so glad they sell it in 2L size, because I could probably drink one all by myself in one sitting...don't judge me! They have some fast food items: hot dogs, burgers, poutine, and large stuffed pretzels; but you don't go for the food, you go for the drink. Wednesday nights in the warmer months are \"Car Night\" where people come by and show off their rims, engines, and whatnot. It's a fun, retro experience in a time where everything is going über high tech."}
{"text":"It's a big orange building that serves one of the best drinks I've ever had.   Decor/Ambiance- 2/5 Yay it's a humongous orange shaped spot! Wait a minute..I have to eat in the car? And the bathroom is practically on the other side of the circumference? Dammit!  Service- 2/5 I always ask questions politely, as I believe that is how I should be treated. And yes- I know this is really a fast food joint. But damn- staff here acted like I was asking them if I could pay in pennies or something.   Food- 4/5 The BEST orange drink I have ever sipped on is sold here. A quart will run you 12 dollars. In hindsight, I should have bought as many as would fit in my car. The poutine was ok. Hot dogs were pretty good because they give them to you in an easy- access paper container.   Bottom line- I would definitely come back just for the orange drink."}
{"text":"You're on the highway. You see a giant orange sphere in the distance. What is that? Is this a national monument of some sort? No, you silly. It's the gigantic orange that everybody talks about.   Orange Julep is a cute place that everyone visits. The line is long, of course. But it's worth the wait for that sweet, sweet orange juice. Yummy. I got two jugs and got a small drink. It was pricey but it's nothing like I've ever had. It's this creamy orange juice concoction that comes from this giant tube at the server till. It's like something out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Charlie and the Orange Juice Factory? Eh. Doesn't have that ring to it.   It's definitely a stop you'll have to make before going home so you can bring this delicious, addictive orange juice home for your family. Or yehknow, just drink it all in the car. No regrets!   P.S. They also serve fast food here, so it's a plus to visit and get food for your long drive home.  P.P.S. - You can't go inside the giant orange :( It's not a cool thing where there are cool windy stairs that you can go up and down. It's literally a huge orange that you stand in line and get your stuff and go. No souvenirs or anything. It's basically a restaurant. I let my imagination get to the best of me again."}
{"text":"Now I like food but not what they sell at Julep. The reviews got me all hyped up to try the orange juice. I wore my stretchy pants, holding my wife's hands , skipping to the line to find out that their supposedly famous best orange juice taste like Tang and evaporated carnation milk we used to drink in 1992 after eating some dirt cookies in Haiti. Their fries are soggy. the salmon is OK so is their hot dogs. Then again, I was hungry. Expensive place, buy one first to try."}
{"text":"A review manly for tourists but the locals know what's up... Orange julep, what a fun little place! I've been to Montreal twice now, once in the winter and now in the summer, and I must say this place is always a go to spot.  You can't miss it as there is a gigantic orange (that is literally bigger than any of the surrounding structures) their orange \"drink\" is quite unique. Many might say \"oh its just like an orange Julius\" to that I say nice try but no it ain't.   It's yummy comfort food!  They got hamburgers,  hot dogs,  putine and even ice cream (which is the best soft serve I've ever had).  But beyond that.... People! Lots of people!  The parking lot is often a get together place for motorcycle enthusiasts, classic and modern car enthusiasts and everything else in between.  It has outdoor seating in the summer , mostly benches and in the winter they tarp off a small area so you can still stay warm in the bitter cold of montreal.  I know that on the way to the airport I'm grabbing a large one to go.  Btw, how often do you get to play xbox on a Lamborghini in a parking lot next to a giant orange.....umm only once (even got free sunglasses after the demo). Whenever I'll pass a DQ that has a orange Julius I'll shake my head and say.... it's not a orange julep!"}
{"text":"Pros to this place....well-situated. Metro is close-by, autoroutes are all merging there. Huge parking lot.   Negatives..... Very expensive food ,  bland tasting food. Nothing extraordinary about it.   Basically it's an overpriced food that you can easily surpass in quality at just about any fast-food joint.  Would not recommend to anyone, nor would I ever go back there to eat."}
{"text":"We had some (childish) fun taking pictures in front of this massive, random, mammoth-sized orange we saw off the highway (I felt like I was James and the Giant Peach - props to anyone who gets that reference). Apparently, this is a well-known tourist stop for a divey, fast-food experience, and we came by for the famed juice many told us we had to try!  The place is nothing short of a total dive, but I guess that's part of the fun! Basically, this big giant orange takes up most of the real estate, and there's no seating inside the actual shop. However, there are many outdoor benches where you can enjoy what you ordered.  While it looks like they have a variety of snack and juice offerings on the menu, we just ordered a Small cup of their famed Julep Juice (which we saw many people buy by the jug!) and it ended up being just okay to us - fresh but overly sweet, and way too sugary for our liking - but I guess that's part of its appeal! Clientele was formed of mostly tourists and families with young kids, and from what we could tell, half the fun of coming here is to have a laugh at the giant orange. If you have time, drop by and see for yourself - it's clearly a very popular stop in Montreal for many."}
{"text":"It's probably super unhealthy but I drink a gallon of that stuff everytime I go. Everything's pretty good and they always have small car shows which makes it a nice lil event every time I go."}
{"text":"Best orange julep ever! It is kind of out of the way but if you have a car, definitely check it out. Awesome juice and amazing fatty fries with duck confit on top. What else can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"The huge orange ball caught my attention from the highway so I decided to stop by the atmosphere resembles a 60's drive-in and the prices to match.   The service was fast I had the number 1 fully dressed and the fries were awesome very unique to Montreal.   I'd recommend you stop and give it a try"}
{"text":"First time here and nothing but amazing experiences! First things first, love how they designed this spot of having the form as an orange! There's always a line up but that's because it's great. I waited for like 3 minutes and got my order. Ordered hot dog and a small fries which cost like $4. It's so cheap but their portions are huge and so filling. Their orange jus is so fresh. Love it as a whole!"}
{"text":"If you've never ventured out to the Orange Julep on Decarie near Jean Talon, do yourself a favour and go. Now.   The Julep they sell in retail outlets really cannot compare in any way. Served ice cold and - I believe - made on the premises, you can buy the frothy goodness in small cups all the way up to large plastic litre jugs. So good.   If you are looking for a snack to go with your drink, indulge in a toastie (toasted hotdog) or a poutine (my personal favourite). The latter is served with generous portions of cheese curds and proper poutine gravy. Oh and did I mention the fries? Anyone who has had a proper Montreal poutine will tell you it is all about the fries - and Orange Julep has 'em.  Wednesday nights Spring - Fall, swing by for Classic Car Night.  A Montreal institution."}
{"text":"I wish I could have a direct line of orange julep to my house. You know, at the sink, three taps instead of two: hot/cold/julep. It's like a delicious orange milkshake.  The poutine is pretty good too. And the hot dogs.  But what's in the big orange? Is it filled with julep to the point of bursting? Stacks of fresh oranges piled up in 3-storey pyramids? Holy relics belonging to the Vatican? The recipe for Coca-Cola? We may never know."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is a Montreal greasy-spoon institution. Now, I've never been here for any of the food, but the place is famous for it's orange drink. I can definitely vouch for the uniqueness of it and it's a must try, especially in Montreal!  Beware, it's quite sweet!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to come by to try the legendary Orange Juice!!! It was simple yet tasty and definitely worth a try! Lineup was long but the service is fast so the wait wasn't that long."}
{"text":"Nice place! Classic drive in restaurant in Montreal. A must visit place. Comparing to other fast food restaurants, food in orange julep is better in quality and taste.  Would recommend the poutine, julep, and cheeseburger"}
{"text":"BEST juleps of all time!! Seriously these are just wayyy too good. I'm giving 5 points based on the drink alone, I don't order the food. The juleppp just get the julep! do it."}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way to Montreal, and only tried their orange drink. It tastes really fresh, but also creamy, which is interesting. I enjoyed it and it was refreshing, but it could have been cheaper (the smallest size was $2.50), but it was an interesting experience! Next time if I'm hungry, I will try their food."}
{"text":"The Julep serves this orange juice that tastes just like a melted orange flavoured creamsicle: sweet, creamy and rich. They also have your typical fast-food: fries, burgers, poutine, hot dogs, etc. The whole food served is meh but theres something charming about driving past the Julep and grabbing a quick bite on their picnic tables - it almost feels like being transported back to the 90s where roadside independent fast food stalls were everywhere."}
{"text":"Experience: 5/5 Food: 3/5   Fries: 2/5  Orange juice tastes like sunny D"}
{"text":"The only thing we have there is the orange julep. It's a classic and it's delicious. We have had the hotdogs and other food there and we are not impressed."}
{"text":"Just ate here today and found the food OK. Not amazing but a nice pit stop if you happen to be in the area and hungry.  It was quite busy on a Sunday night. But the vibe here is really relaxed and lots of families come here. If they had a movie playing on a projector somewhere though I would give it another star. I think this place could be a great eat/movie place"}
{"text":"You heard or have seen the Big Apple but do u know there is the Big Orange in Montreal ?? Technically the name of the place is Orange Julep Gibeau (but I think it should be renamed Big Orange). Unlike the Big Apple, u cannot go inside the Big Orange  :( maybe they should open it up and make it as a touristy areas ahhahahah    The huge big Orange cannot be missed as u drive up from autoroute 40, Decarie. Though it is open all year long, summer seems to be the most busy with people driving their bikes and cars for OJ and food. This used to be a drive Thru where the attendants bring food to your car but long goneis  this old 50's style.  The orange juice is made from Sunkist oranges and the drink taste really sweet and creamy but oh boy, the prices have went up considerably to the point it so now $4.65 for a medium and I think $16 for a jug ?? (Used to be $8)  Holy ! the small is a very tiny cup for $2.65+.  The drink has a lot of bubbles and air when it gets pour out from the machine so the attendant make sure to shake the jug so that u get every penny worth when buying the expensive OJ jug.  At the big Orange, they don't just sell orange juice. They also sell fries, hot dogs , poutine and even smoked meat. I tried the food and it just OK. The orange juice is the star.   if you haven't tried it or never been, I would highly recommend it. A must stop for all :)"}
{"text":"The Orange Julep is a huge tourist attraction because of it's hard to miss, 3 stories high, orange structure.  I was looking forward to trying it out and hoping that their famous Orange drink would be as amazing as all the tourist books claimed. Sadly, it was a huge let down.   The food was extra greasy, even for a fast food place. The 'special' orange drink tasted exactly like a melted dreamsicle, nothing extraordinary or particularly good about it.   It's a good place to visit once, but don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"I can't believe I only just tried the veggy options that Orange Julep has to offer!  It was at the top of my list (mainly because of Aron's reviews) but we never got round to it. When passing by this last weekend, I ordered the veggy hot dog and it was amazing! Delicious on a lovely grilled bun and washed down with the famous orange juice.  Can't wait to have it again soon - already craving it!"}
{"text":"Love their orange juice! and their fries and poutine, in my opinion, are one of the best in town! Their fries are not crunchy (keep that in mind) but incredibly sweet and flavourful! Thick poutine gravy, plus the amazing fries and cheese = heaven! Nothing fancy, but very very TASTY!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from the Big Apple it's only right to visit the BIG Orange in Montreal. Prior to Mont Tremblant we stopped on over to Orange Julep which is serving their popular Julep which in my opinion resembles and thicker orange-milk shake. Inside, the place is nothing special, but rather a fast food chain that's planted inside of a giant orange, however they do incorporate orange into their menu by featuring their ever-so-popular Julep. if you're not here for Julep they do have plenty of fast food options such as your traditional burgers, fries, etc.   Their prices are 'somewhat reasonable' however paying $3 for a small Julep is a bit absurd.  Would I be back, probably not as there's so many great food places in this lovely city.   Merci!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit on your way out of the city IMO. The actual orange drink is tasty and the food I had was typical fast food grub.   Go here for a great experience and to live out the dream of taking a photo of a giant orange.   Yeah yeah yeah it's kinda like a bootleg version of Orange Julius but so what! It's for sure worth a visit, esp. when there is a nice summer night in the works."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly ridiculous.   It's a big, fat, giant orange. That's what it is and that's where you drive up and place your order. Your food is produced in a trippy, big, fat, giant orange.   It's ah-mazing.   The initial hilarity wore off pretty fast, but then I realized that my food would come out of a big-fat, juicy orange and it was clear that -even if the food subpar (I mean, its not like I expected gourmet poutine, but still) it wouldn't matter... much.   I ordered a small orange juice and poutine ($9) and I was slightly (read above) disappointed that it was sweetened. Sugar in fresh juice is disgusting.   The poutine was great, squeaky curds, gravy and all with soft fries.   If you're doing the fun, tourist thing I recommend a trip to Orange Julep."}
{"text":"The Julep is delicious and the giant orange is a Montreal icon, but apart from that, it is really just over-priced hot dogs and fries. A nice stop for a tourist, I guess. I would stop by to pick up a jug of orange juice but I pass on the rest."}
{"text":"How is it that I don't have a review for this place? Insane.  The Orange Julep is a Montreal institution... a sight and wonder while driving up or down \"Highway\" 15. Who can miss this huge orange and not be interested to try it out at least once in their life? This place is well known for its fast food and sweet orange juice.   Is it pricey? Absolutely!   Is it still worth it? OH YEAH!!!!   Why do you think this place has survived the test of time?  How's the other comfort food? I like it well enough. Their combos are decently priced, I really like their Michigan hot dogs and their fries are somewhat unique and tasty. Their poutine is solid enough though if you're a tourist, try it elsewhere first.  But ultimately folks come here for the orange juice. It's sweet, creamy, frothy? and most importantly... it makes you HAPPY.  I've been coming to this drive-in since I've been a child. My mother used to work on the other side of the street at the Hotel and my dad and I would grab some drinks once in awhile because heck... why not? Solid memories folks.  Occasionally, if you're lucky... you might visit this place on car show nights with folks driving their nice cars to the drive-in.  They are open all year long."}
{"text":"Gibeau Orange Julep is a fast food restaurant that is located off of Decarie that has been around since '45.  Started by Hermas Gibeau to serve up his version of the Orange Julius, I was pretty excited to check this restaurant out, more so because of the building structure.  Yes, it is shaped like a big orange!  It's about 40 feet wide in diameter and about 3 stories high; you really can't miss it when you get off the Metro!  The hubs and I went later in the evening, and when you walk in, you order up with one of the cashiers.  I tried a cheeseburger combo, which came with a side of fries and an Orange Julep drink (which is an orange cream drink made with Sunkist oranges); a corn dog, and a 2-dog combo (one Michigan (which is topped with a ground meat chili sauce) and a toaste, all dressed.  The burger itself was just okay, but the buns were a bit stale and the patty slightly dried out.  The corn dog, while having a nice crisp exterior, was filled with a pale, bland-tasting dog T___T  The hot dogs were also underwhelming; the chili was tomato-based, but was bland in taste, and the toaste, while the buttered up toasted bun was tasty, the dog and the fixings were night.  The highlight was the Orange Julep drink, as it was cold, sweet, creamy, and refreshing - I actually really liked it!  Staff were friendly, and there is some counter where you can stand and eat; most just pick it up to-go.  This roadside attraction is interesting to check out, more to take pictures of the orange-shaped structure.  You can pick up some Orange Julep along the way, but forget their food items!  +cool orange-shaped structure! +Orange Julep beverage +friendly staff +plenty of parking"}
{"text":"I absolutely am in love with the Orange Julep. I wish there was more than one location because driving 5 hours to eat here is a bit ridiculous. It is well worth it though. The poutine is also delicious"}
{"text":"A Montreal classic that is worth a visit at least once. Orange Julep is definitely the star, but hotdog with poutine wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine!!!! Loveeed their frappes!! You should also try their veggie hotdogs. I've already been there 2 since spring this year."}
{"text":"This is a must-go place in Montreal!  Highlights:  * Poutine So much yummy gravy for a sauce-boss right here!  * Hot dogs  How do you make them so good..? Keep in mind that the hot dog is smaller than your usual hot dog stand sizes; I think those who are \"hangry\" can actually consume 2-3 hot dogs from here haha  * Orange juice  Duh! It's really delicious - it's creamy and kind of milky? I'm making it sound weird but it tastes so delicious. I bought a few jars back home :D"}
{"text":"Can't resist stopping for a drink when driving by, what can I say.  Sugary orange juice water. Yummy"}
{"text":"Orange Julep, what in the heck is that you might ask? Well, picture a melted orange creamsicle in beverage form. It's some sort of concoction consisting of OJ, milk, egg whites and sugar and the result is one of the best things you will ever drink.   It's got a frothy head, a smooth consistency, it's incredibly tasty, and probably packed with 1000 calories, but who cares! If ever in Montreal you must try it!   While I love the julep (who couldn't love a gigantic orange dispensing orange drinks?), I would also highly recommend the poutine. The fries are great, the gravy is rich and flavorful and the cheese curds top it all off.   The only minor negative is that it can be pricey. The julep is not a cheap drink, so get a medium, I promise you it's enough!"}
{"text":"Malgré que je sois né a montreal, ce fut ma premiere visite au Orange Julep sur Decarie. Tous connaissent la grosse orange et la réputé boisson a l' orage fouettée. Ils y avait au moins 10 minutes d' attente mais en ce dimanche soir d' été rien ne presse. Les commande sont prises sur le sac qui va contenir ton hotdog ou burger ou ton pogo. Une fois au comptoir la commande se fait rapidement avec le sourire. Le système semble tres bien rodé puisqu'a peine quelques minutes plus tard, j'avais ma commande. hotdog, poutine et une bouteille d' eau. je connais bien la boisson a l' orange tres sucré et n'en avais pas le gout cette fois. Le hotdog grillé et la poutine étaient bons mais rien pour écrire a sa mère.Je suis quand meme heureux d'etre Allé a cette institution. Parking facile et des tables a piquenique sont installées autour de la grosse orange."}
{"text":"Not a montrealer until you've come here and tasted the magical Orange Julep! Their hot dogs are addictingly good and so is their poutine! Worth the metro ride to come and eat here!"}
{"text":"Oh Giant Orange Julep, it's been 10 years of driving on by you, never stopping, always wondering and tonight it finally stopped. But you didn't wow me. 10 years of wondering must have set my expectations soaring, but 10 years probably saw to a giant price increase?   Let's face it, it wasn't cheap eating there, in fact not cheap at all, I got a Veggie Burger with Julep and a poutine, then I saw those Yo Dough cookies and thought I would give that a go too, and $22 dollars later, I could say my meal was ok. The Julep was tasty and the selection quite broad, (having veggie options, gluten free hotdogs, pasta, tuna salad, filet of cod etc.)  So I guess I'm happy I finally checked it out, but maybe I'd have to go back in the summertime to re-live it all."}
{"text":"This is a staple in Montreal, my brother in law loves their OJ, burgers and poutine. So naturally, he had to drive 20min in the dreadful winter cold to introduce my Cali husband to the Orange Julep. The OJ was well worth it and their poutine is always mmm mmm good."}
{"text":"I always wanted to visit since I've first moved to Montreal in 2014. December 2017 was when I first got to go, and it met my expectations. Think of Orange Julius, but with a cooler building.   They also serve a range of your typical fast foods like hot dogs, hamburgers and whatnot, but my boyfriend heard on the radio that their spaghetti was really good. Being a pasta fanatic, we got some, and it was surprisingly pretty good! For $6, it was a decently sized, good all-round spaghetti. Try it!"}
{"text":"C'est pas loin du métro Namur . On peut y acheter des jus mais aussi des desserts et de la nourriture  telle que des Hot dog !"}
{"text":"Medium Orange Julep - it has an interesting flavor - good, almost like a creamsicle. The price was very reasonable and it is iconic."}
{"text":"Unique orange juice experience, a mandatory stop when in Montreal. Rest of menu is typical fried fare, very flavorful, but dont let you doctor catch you there twice in a week. A strict drive-in, a few picnic benches on the side for summer time, open all night."}
{"text":"The only place on Earth to get a cup of julep. So delicious. Although slightly expensive, but well worth it. The food is average, but I come for the julep.  The orange shaped orange building is iconic and visible from the sky as you fly into Montreal.  A must for every trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Today really seems to be a three star day. I just wanted a small caramel sundae. Asked for a \"coupe glacee\" and got a \"cornet\". Repeat myself 3 times until she understands what I want, ask for vanilla, and then she asks me if I want chocolate or vanilla topping. They don't even have vanilla topping, she just didn't know what caramel was or that thy even had that. C'mon guys. Even if she's new.  80% of your customers order the orange drink or ice cream. Get your sh** together."}
{"text":"Order the Poutine (awesome) & their signature Orange drink (good), ignore the rest of their menu, sit back & enjoy. A bit pricy, but one of the Best Poutine experiences you can have in MTL, the other being Foie Gras Poutine @ APC."}
{"text":"You can't miss this Montreal institution. This Huge orange ball on Decarie serves Hot-Dogs and this interesting creamy orange juice. I work steps away from this place and its great in the summer."}
{"text":"Don't always believe the hype when it comes to Montreal.  This place is only a 'souvenir'. Today it's a inexplicably expensive regular fast food restaurant.  The orange juice they serve is a home recipe, made with water, pressed orange juice and sugar added. $5 for a relatively small cup. It is not pure pressed orange juice, which would sell for the same price elsewhere in Montreal. The Poutine is no longer anything special, save for the price - $7 for a small size. As you can figure up, it will quickly add up to $15/person if not more. Basically, there is a La Belle Province just across the street, as well as a Harvey's just in sight.  Cross the road and you will find proper seating and same food quality - or better - at a regular fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"If you love orange juice like me, you will love this place! The orange juice is so good. I had to buy some for friends on our trip back to Toronto. The combination of the orange juice is so yummy.   Pros: - Food: The orange juice is so yummy! I believe that it's made with Sunkist Orange Juice and possibly combined with something else which makes it taste so fresh. You can buy  - Parking: The lot here is huge. Tons of parking during any time of day or night.  - Price: I would say that the food and drink options here are fairly priced. You are paying between $7-12 for a drink, but it is massive. One drink you can split between 2 people.  - Picture worthy: The huge orange is so cute to take pictures of food with. You can saw it from down the road!    Foods/Drinks I like: - Poutine - Orange Julep - Orange Creamy Julep"}
{"text":"The hot dogs are straight up disgusting. They over price everything ($17.00 for 2 Michigans and a poutine not including tip) the service is mediocre at best. The food left me feeling disgusted and ripped off. **WARNING THIS PLACE IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE AND THATS NOT JUST MY OPINION...GO THERE AND YOU'LL SEE IT'S A FACT**"}
{"text":"You can't miss the orange shape building on Decarie Street. This place served the delicious orange drink, it is literally famous for their secret ingredient.  The food and desserts menu isn't so bad either.   In the early morning to lunchtime, there isn't much of a lineup.  Come evening, the lineup can be pretty long. About 10 to 15 minutes of wait time.   Overall, the drink is worth the wait. I wouldn't pass up the street without buying a Julep drink.  It is the iconic drink of Julep."}
{"text":"Orange julep is an institution in Montreal. A place to meet up. You may come here for the greasy spoon food but I come here for one thing. Luscious delicious Orange Julep. Sure it's like the Orange Julius I grew up with (in Western Canada) but I believe it's better. Firstly it comes out of a huge chemistry like looking futuristic tube of what looks like a draft tap. Secondly I have a guilty pleasure. I take it home and put it in the freezer and drink it semi frozen. that is if I can make it last to home which is a good test of self will power. Orange Julep is a Montreal landmark. On summer nights you see car clubs meeting up here or biker dudes . They all come here and many leave with a milkshake like texture of Orange delight. Overpriced? I don't think so. You may (at around $5 a drink) but to each their own. If you like Oragne creamsicles come grab one. Try putting it in the freezer. It shrinks, but it's my secret mixture that's even more refreshing the colder it is."}
{"text":"Wow, this was expectantly delicious.  My girlfriend kept wanting to try this \"Orange Juice Place\"- I was skeptical about how great this orange juice could be ...oh boy I was in for a surprise. The Julep is kinda a orange milkshake-I know it sounds gross but is delicious! Think like a creamsickle. And the comfort food was a great value as well! We ended up getting hot dogs with a jug of the julep to go.  Highly recommended as drunk food!"}
{"text":"Honestly, yes the orange julep is unique, because of the orange juice and the big orange place itself, but I think its overrated. The orange juice I think is too sweet for me, and the food is not that special, it could be found everywhere. They have hotdog, fries and those basic fast food, but the orange juice is still a good to try for the first time. But after the first, I dont think its that worth going back here, its just a nice experience to see the big orange, and taste it."}
{"text":"Been going there since I was a kid living in Montreal.  You must have the Julep, and have them add ice cream to make it a \"frappe\".  Food is OK, nothing special, your regular OK fast food.   I have found nothing in my travels that is like an Orange Julep. Very unique."}
{"text":"OJ tasted good as everyone say so. Many packages of food choices. Better come at summer can sit outside. I will definitely come again with family."}
{"text":"Was visiting from New York, and could not help but notice this large orange shack in the middle of the road!  Couple of relatives later told us what the orange orb was and I figured we had to go!  We ordered a half gallon of their Julep, two Pogos (or we call them corn dogs, haha) and a poutine.  The Julep was super delicious, I have never had any beverage like it! It tasted like the creaminess from  an orange creamsicle pop, but you can taste the freshness the freshly squeezed orange. Super good! If I lived in the area, I would buy a half gallon on a weekly basis.  The pogos were super delicious! There's a certain kick to the flavor of the corn dogs that I usually do not taste in most corn dogs. I would eat again for sure!  The poutine was very very tasty! I definitely was looking for some good poutine when I was visiting Montreal, and I was very happy to get some here. When I go to Montreal again, I will definitely get poutine from the joint again.  Overall super cool spot in a very cool city!"}
{"text":"Like most people, I'm sure, I just can't get enough of that Orange Julep!  Sure, a lot of people say it's like Orange Julius, but it's not the same.  Whenever I travel on Decarie and see that big orange ball, my heart is filled with excitement and joy.  OK, the gushy part of the review is over now.  In practical terms, don't expect a haute cuisine experience here, this is an old-school diner style restaurant, just without the indoor seating.  In previous years, the servers used to bring you the food on roller skates, but now you just pick it up yourself at the window.  They serve regular chain restaurant food: hot dogs, fries, hamburgers, poutines, along with a few other options like tuna sandwiches and salmon patties. As a vegetarian, I appreciate that they offer veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, and even veggie pogos!  These kind of things are often hit or miss, but at the Orange Julep I've always found the veggie options to be very tasty.  Extra bonus, the poutine gravy is veggie-based! Admittedly, I find the fries to be rather disappointing, but all I really care about is the cheese (and not eating meat), so I'll settle for the compromise on fry quality.  Gibeau Orange Julep has been a Montreal fixture (in various incarnations) since 1932.  If you haven't been there yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Came here with my wifey, we're newish to Montreal. My Mom lived here in the 70s and told me to go to this place, that she used to go there.  It was cool. Awesome sunny day, ordered a couple of burgers, fries and orange juleps, and sat on the benches. Felt like we were in a 50s diner or something. Classics playing over the speakers. I loved it. Food was junkyish, but was a cool experience. I dig. :)"}
{"text":"A Montreal institution and well known venue with good dogs, fries and the inexplicably delicious Orange Julep juice. A concoction made of fresh OJ, cream and eggs. All in an old 60s era giant orange probably visible from low orbit. Usually all the  dudes with old muscle cars show off their rides in the huge parking lot on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"Mediocre Food wayyy too overpriced! The smoke meat sandwich was ok but the most important thing (the juice) tastes like full on water a dab of orange juice and a gallon of sugar!!! Eeek a heart attack waiting to happen for morbidly obese people!!! Seriously I was about to puke on that drink it was not good at all!! Fries were soggy as hell and bitter :/ blehhh   The service is terrible even at 2am they work and serve you very slow. The prices are way too high!!! Like one sandwhich trio is over 10$ .. Absurd!  They're no good the only cool thing they've got going is that big huge orange that you can see from far away .... -.- .....   Overall, I do NOT recommend this place whatsoever!!! Never ever again!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if today's batch was bad, but the orange drink was disgustingly sweet, we had to throw it out. We even saw others throwing it out while mentioning how sweet it was. It tasted like they had mixed orange juice with sugar water or something. Not good unless you are aiming to get diabetes. Poutine was okay, the burger was super mediocre and not satisfying. Hot dog was good."}
{"text":"Came here for the orange juice. The design of the building is very unique and can be spotted from far away. It's in a shape of an orange.    Bought a jug of orange juice. The orange juice is sweet but very refreshing. Will definitely come again !"}
{"text":"Orange julep .. Who in momtreal has never visited that location ? Its like going to paris and not visiting the Eiffel tower or visiting london without seeing the big ben .. Julep is like the iconic monument of montreal  Did a quick pit stop due to heavy traffic on Decarie and had a medium orange julep and a veggy hot dog :)   One word : LOVELY :)  Hot dog bread well grilled and juice was reallt good especially in the heat but dammmm its more expensive than starbucks lol   Enjoyy"}
{"text":"How can you miss that giant orange on Decarie, I have been here dozen of times. They got great grilled hotdogs and there fries aren't too bad. The real star here is there drink, a blend of orange and I think egg whites I can be wrong, either way it's delicious.   Tuesday's are full with cars, they usually show off there cars on Tuesday and Thursday's. Nice spot to just chill and have a bite. Montreal staple"}
{"text":"BEST POUTINE EVERRR. service is really good and quick and it's such a nice vibe during the summer! must go!!"}
{"text":"Had a Orange Julep from the dessert category. Liked it."}
{"text":"Came with my Canadian friends before leaving Montreal for their \"orange drink,\" friend of my friend said that orange julep juice was a must try!  We only ordered the orange julep since we didn't do anything except eating prior to coming here. The orange julep was unique but tasted a lot like a smoothie of orange juice with super sweet whipcream :\  I'm a sweet tooth but this drink was way too sweet for my taste..."}
{"text":"Qui ne connaît pas de nom ou de vue le Orange Julep. Il est impossible de manquer cette fameuse boule orange lorsque l'on passe sur Décarie. Il s'agit d'un restaurant rapide qui sert principalement de la nourriture grasse (junk food), mais si bonne :D Leur menu a pas mal évolué depuis les dernières années. Quand j'étais jeune, ils ne proposaient pas de veggie burger ou des burger de poissons. J'aime le fait qu'ils diversifient leur offre, surtout que je suis fan des veggie burger. Celui là était très bon, pas très santé à mon avis, mais goûteux et je pouvais le garnir à mon choix (tomate, laitue, cornichon, mayo). Nous avons partagé une petite poutine qui vient dans le combo et je peux dire que nous étions assez à trois dessus. Elle était excellente, les frites brunes bien grasses comme on les aime et la sauce brune délicieuse. Ils n'ont toutefois pas fait d'effort au niveau de la propreté des lieux, les tables à pique-nique étaient toutes sales, on mange parmi les mouettes (malheureusement ils ne peuvent rien à cela) et parmi les poubelles. Ils ont mis une nouvelle section de tables sous une tente, idéale si on ne veut pas recevoir de mauvaises surprises de la part des mouettes !!! PS j'ai trouvé le goût de leur jus d'orange (leur spécialité) nettement meilleur, moins sucré et plus doux. De plus, équipe sur place, un peu perdu, les commandes ne sont pas respectées mon copain n'a pas eu le bon cheeseburger ...."}
{"text":"IDK what they put in their OJ but it sure is delicious. (My guess is lots of sugar, and some milk-ish substance) It can't be all that good for you but definitely worth a try and the calories.  Tastes like a creamsicle but not overwhelmingly sweet.  This is a great place to drop by and grab some \"orange juice\" for the road since it's on the outer part of town.   I didn't try any of food here but did leave with a full jug to take home and two large drinks for the road trip back to Toronto."}
{"text":"FYI: I apologize for my mini hiatus from Yelp. A fellow Yelper recently asked to follow up on where was the best poutine in Canada indeed was and I shall proudly bestow an answer!  But first I shall warn you that none of my pretty words will truly do justice to how delicious this particular poutine really is! As an aspiring journalist/Yelp Elite Member, I will try my hardest! So it is located at this BIG ORANGE SPHERE looking thing, for lack of better words... (I told you my pretty words cannot deliver justice!) See picture instead please...!  It is without a question the best poutine I have ever consumed in my 24 years of living. As a native Canadian, I take pride of what I say is the best poutine because I believe it's one of our signature dishes. No other country really serves it, right? I should also note that ever since living in the states, I yearn for it every time I travel back home to Quebec. It's like a long lost friend and you get excited every time you see 'em again! It's simply and arguably the greatest. TRY IT and if you disagree, please feel free to comment on my Yelp and enlighten me where you THINK the best poutine is at. But I doubt it; I just foresee a lot of Yelpers thanking me for introducing them to the best poutine ever on Earth is.   Aside from the scrumptious poutine (there are a variety to choose from; I usually just order the \"Original\"), they also serve the best ORANGE JUICE ever. Fuck Tropicana, Minute Maid, Simply Orange. (Profanity is needed/crucial because this is some serious OJ). Again, I suggest you try it and come back and enlighten me (AKA thank me) on what you think :)   This whole review sounds like a threat. Us Canadians just want you to taste authenticity is all! Enjoy yourself, fellow Yelpers! Thank me later. (sound familiar?...Drizzy much?)"}
{"text":"Love it here! The burgers are amazing and the poutine. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of the orange juice!! No where to sit and eat in the winter which sucks so if you are planning to go eat here you might want to eat in your car or at home. But in the summer theres picnic tables outside"}
{"text":"Oh the orange.  The famous orange julep tasted like a mix of egg nog and orange juice. It was very sweet and creamy. Their poutine wasn't anything special but the gravy sauce was pretty good.   This place seems to have become a tourist attraction! I heard that it was built in the 70's and that there were more than one orange at the time. Imagine multiple oranges this size spread throughout Montréal! :) It is accessible via Métro (get off at Station Namur and look for the orange, voilà)."}
{"text":"Another Montreal institution and a concept lost in time. Whether you roll up or walk-in, it still gives off that feeling of a 50's drive-in. Classic rock blasting from every corner, park-in diners strewn across the lot, and a floating fluorescent sign flashing proudly in the corner.   Make your way up to the counter and the first thing you notice is tubes leading up to god knows where. This is where the sweet orange glop is housed, presumably floating freely through the giant orange structure. Don't let that get to you though, you'll want this to wash everything down. Next, you're greeted by a clearly rushed, but never discourteous team. Don't bide your time though... people are waiting. After ordering, you make your way to the side and wait in anticipation, while you sip away on your julep.   The food is pretty good for a cases croute. By no means unbelievable, but it has a certain taste to it that I have yet to see duplicated, and that's exactly why I keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Si je vais Julep c'est uniquement et toujours pour leurs fameux jus. Leurs nourriture a l'air passable mais le cote tourristique compense pour ca. Un bon endroit pour amner une date."}
{"text":"The Orange Julep is an institution here in Montreal.  This classic drive-in gained its fame by serving up the Orange Julep, an orange drink that some might compare to the Orange Julius.  The two cannot be compared though.  Sorry Orange Julius fans but the Julep reigns supreme.  The Orange Julep is located right on Decarie and you can see it from a mile away.  Look for the giant orange and you know you will have found the Orange Julep.  I have always felt that the giant orange was a Montreal landmark in its own special way.  They serve up the classics of fast food like burgers and hot dogs.  The fast food is as good as any other casse croute.  They do make good hot dogs and the poutine is pretty good.  The real reason you come here though is for the Orange Julep.  The drink is frothy and creamy.  The recipe is a secret so I couldn't tell you what is in it but I can tell you that it is delicious.  They dispense it from these futuristic looking tubes and it almost looks like something out of a sci-fi movie.  Some might say it is a bit expensive and for fast food I agree it is a little on the pricey side.  It is definitely worth the occasional splurge though.  The Julep is awesome and a part of Montreal's history so whether you are a Montrealer or a visitor you need to come here."}
{"text":"God's blessing to Montrealers!  The oldest Drive-In in Quebec & they still have Car Shows! I have been coming since I can remember as a child. Soooo Good, Sooo Unique and Soooo worthwile any which way you gotta travel to get there. Point Finale!!!!!"}
{"text":"What do you eat when your better half has never been to Canada? Why, it's Orange Julep!  So yeah, the ladyfriend has never been to Canada, and we were oh-so-close to the Canadian border in Burlington, VT... Why not zip into Canada, grab some lunch and head home? Well, apparently doing this causes extra questions at the border because no one really tends to believe that Americans from Atlanta are just \"going to Montreal for lunch\". Well, we were.  My French isn't as good as I thought, and neither was my international cellular data-plan, which severely hindered FINDING Montreal once we left the comfort of the English-speaking world. A few screenshots later and we are well on our way to Orange Julep. Traffic was terrible in downtown Montreal, but that's to be expected, so once I saw that big, orange sphere on the left, I was almost panting for poutine. I just wanted off the roads, and wanted food... now.  Ordering is a simple affair, and the nice ladies at the counter speak English (as do most Canadians), so ordering our food with the julep was easy. A short wait later, and we were set to eat like Murrrcans. The weather sucked, so we found shelter under one of their little covered areas on the edges of the parking lot, where the birds wait for your crumbs. Please don't feed these little bastards. S'il vous plaît?  The food. Well, by the time we got our food, I had already drank my orange julep, which does remind me of a melted Orange Julius, but it also stands alone in the taste department. They are similar, but NOT the same. Needless to say (but I will), the orange julep is pretty ****ing tasty by itself. Then there's the poutine... I got poutine as a side with my numbered order, but they give you enough poutine to feed a small family. Seriously., and we had TWO sides of poutine to consume. Too damned much indeed. She had a hot dog, and I had the salmon burger, which reminded me of The Varsity in Atlanta, GA. Some might take this as a negative, but it's famous for a reason, right?   All-in-all, the visit to Montreal went exactly as I hoped it would. Orange Julep delivered exactly how I hoped it would. Is it Michelin-rated? Hell no, but it was as advertised. On a return visit to Montreal, I'm sure we'll go somewhere else, but at least we don't have to check Orange Julep off the box then, right?"}
{"text":"MTL's symbol  Authentic MTL's orange juice.  If you are from MTL then you know this place. Nothing else to say. Sometimes, they got car show. People drive their old fashioned car to this place.   When I came to MTL. I leave next to metro De La Savane. Just next to this orange ball.  Have to try if you never did."}
{"text":"I like their classic orange juice but still find it sugary. Had their poutine recently ;) surprisingly vegetarian , good and super hot for winter evening!!! :) I would go there again for their poutine and orange juice"}
{"text":"1 étoile parce que ça existe et une 2e étoile pour l'orange. Ce n'est pas un bon resto et les prix sont ridicules. Le Julep c'est l'endroit idéal pour y rencontrer quelqu'un puisque de partout sur Décarie on peut voir l'horrible montgolfier sale nous rappelant à tous cette agonisante chaîne. Point fort: je ne suis jamais constipé après avoir bu leur fameuse boisson."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on a flight from Europe and about to land, I always know I'm in Montreal by two landmarks which are easily identifiable from the air: The Olympic Stadium and the iconic Orange Julep.  This place has taken tackiness and elevated it to an art form. The rollerblading waitresses from the 1950's are long gone, but the greasy burgers, fries, hotdogs, pogo sticks (or corn dogs for you Americans), and of course Orange Julep drink are all still there.  Between May and September, try to go on a Wednesday night when all the vintage cars and hot rods of Montreal show up and everyone is free to walk around and check everything out along with the colorful personalities. (speaking for myself I prefer that over the Grand Prix scene on Crescent Street any day).  It's a fun place to go for fast eats in the summer in Montreal."}
{"text":"J'ai pas détesté mon experience au julep, La poutine est bonne, le jus d'orange beaucoup trop sucrée a mon goût. Ce qui ma le plus surpris est le prix! 15$ pour la plus petite poutine et un jus dorange bref si vous voulez payer un peu plus chère pour manger à coté d'une orange c'est votre choix mais je vous recomande d'aller dans n'importe qu'elle casse-croute miteux a la place vous allez remarquer aucune difference a l'exeption de l'orange."}
{"text":"The giant orange ball is impossible to miss and you can spot it from the top of Saint Joseph's Oratory. I only had one thing - the orange julep - and it was SO GOOD.  Any OJ fan must try this drink.  It's made of fresh orange juice, milk and some special delicious ingredient.  It was light and refreshing and a total must have!"}
{"text":"Orange Julep is so sweet and fresh.  it is not fresh make but still fresh when i drink it.   the food is good too."}
{"text":"Quintessentially average casse-croute food. The toastés were pretty good, and the poutine was fine. I didn't enjoy the orange julep drink, but if drinking melted creamsicle sounds good to you, you'll probably like it.  Eating outside next to the big orange was fun, and I get that it's a Montreal landmark, but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Their orange juice is special! I don't usually like to drink orange juice unless it's freshly squeezed. But their orange juice is so special that keeps me wanting to drink more to figure out the taste. It's interestingly good. Their building is unique and so easy to find."}
{"text":"a must viait in Montreal. Classic muix, sweet n fresh orange juice wow..really worth to visit!!!!!!  Love the Big orange"}
{"text":"Very good fast food and service.  We got the fish and chips, hot dog, French fries and a cheeseburger. Everything was fresh made and so good the orange julep was sweet for sure but not as sweet as I expected still couldn't drink even half so I was glad to have shared it.  The hot dog is not what I am used to in terms of being a New Yorker but to be honest.... They are better. It seems like they are on some toasty ass brioche-esque bread and man that's just the start the hot dog is perfectly hot and comes with my favourite hot dog toppings mustard, onions and relish I mean .... Why don't they make them like that back home ?!  Cheeseburger was also super fresh and probably the most amazing bun and burger ratios I have ever seen its really something to behold also sporting onions, relish, lettuce and tomato I couldn't ask for much more.  Mom dukes had the fish and chips and she was into it she said the Cole slaw and tartar sauce are superior and although the fish is fishier than she was used to it was still delicious.  French fries are good as a side for sure but they need some dressing up still can't go wrong with fried patats right ?  Good prices, good portions, fresh and fast what more do you want from fast food."}
{"text":"I recommend making a stop when in Montreal. Not necessarily for the food, which is basically fast food, but the Orange drink. Tastes like an orange creamscicle. I'm not a huge fan of the sugary orange flavor, but my son really liked the big orange ball."}
{"text":"QUOI?!?!?! Y'a personne qui a écrit d'avis sur l'Orange Julep en français? Vraiment?!?! Bon bien, j'y vais!  C'est le spot parfait pour s'arrêter quand on est tanné d'être pris dans le trafic sur la 15 ou sur le boulevard Décarie. On y sert hot-dogs, hamburgers, frites et plein d'autres trucs de style fast-food mais vraiment, on vient ici pour le jus Orange Julep, une espèce de boisson aux oranges et à la crème. Ça goûte comme un \"Creamsicle\" version lait frappé! Et si l'extra grand n'est pas assez pour satisfaire votre soif, il y a toujours le galon. À emporter ou partager avec des amis en étant assis sur le \"hood\" de votre char en faisant jouer de la grosse musique dans le stationnement. Il y a des tables de pique-nique à l'extérieur mais c'est pas mal tout alors je déconseille une visite en plein hiver quand il fait moins 30. L'été, c'est mieux."}
{"text":"you want to come here for the freshly squeezed out orange juice riiiiight? nothing beats that delicious drink! poutine and hot-dogs, seem casual right? nothing special, but that's the trick!!! simple is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, I tried at least 4 different poutine places and this was my favourite.  This place is all about the comfort food and outdoor seating.  It reminded me of being at the carnival.  It was fun to take pictures in front of the big orange too."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a giant orange ball in the middle of a parking lot, what more can I say? The inside feels like it hasn't been renovated in years but I guess that's the vintage look that it's going for.  FOOD: Honestly, the only good things were the fries and the drink. The burger and hot dogs were not as impressive. I could find better tasting burgers at Wendys next door. The famous drink of Montreal tastes like a melted Orange Creamsicle but it wasn't bad.  PRICE: You're paying for the experience (although it wasn't that spectacular) and the brand more than you're paying for the food. Not worth the price but I had to come here once in my life to be a true Montrealer.  SERVICE: It was a counter-type service, not much to be commented on here. The only thing I felt was that the server didn't seem very thrilled to be there."}
{"text":"This was the first place I went to when I was in Montreal. I landed around like 8am, first Montreal meal was an orange julep and a hot dog. It's a cute drive up spot, giant orange circle ball thing. Can't miss it! I wasn't a fan of the orange julep beverage, it was like some funky melted orange creamsicle. Could have been that airplane oxygen affecting my tastebuds still, but it was still good.  Went back again to walk around the car show.  It's definitely a must while in Montreal. Perfect first pit stop!"}
{"text":"I can never go to Montreal and not stop by here. It's hands down the best orange drink place ever."}
{"text":"I must to anyone who is visiting Montreal. The food is \"o.k\"., but their opening hours make ip for it. The one thing you must try is their Julep juice. Ask them to add ice cream to your drink; it takes it to another level."}
{"text":"This is just one of those places you have to go to. How many times are you going to see a giant orange?  When we got there around 9pm on a Friday night there was a pretty big line. They were decently fast but we still waited a good 15 minutes for ordering and receiving our food.   I had the cheeseburger meal and upgraded my fries to poutine. The cheeseburger was pretty standard for fast food but I enjoyed it. The poutine was ok but the cheese curds  were very cold that they didn't melt at all, still overall good though. The orange julep drink has a nice creamy flavor and texture. I thought it would be like a milkshake but it's more like a frothy creamy orange juice.   There is only outdoor seating or standing room inside to eat your meal. There is a decent sized parking lot if you drive. It is also easy to get to via the metra."}
{"text":"Note: Review is based on the Orange drink only.  Another must visit place when you are in Montreal. Looks like this is where many Montreal locals would go to get their fast food fix. I feel like Orange Julep to Montreal is like Dick's burger for Seattle or Inn n Out in California, if you are familiar with any of them. It's one of those fast food places which could quickly identify a city.  The place was located tucked just a little outside the city and signified by a pretty conspicuous orange colored dome. You parked your car and ordered typical fast food items like burger, hot dogs, poutines (of course .. for Montreal), or desserts. I ordered  the two kinds of orange -- the original and the frappe version. Both of them I enjoyed, although I still prefer the regular version, which tasted like a bit like creamsicle...only more satisfying & sophisticated. The price was a little more pricey than a regular dine in place, just like others mentioned, but it was absolutely worth it. #foodtraveler   I kind of regretted not trying the poutine and the other food items but I was waay too full after all the food that I tried during the day at Montreal. Let this be another reason to stop by Montreal some day. For now, another thing I managed to cross off the Montreal bucket list!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Wife and in laws told me this place is really good. Was told that the OJ was out of this world. I came here with quite high expectations. When we arrived, first thing I noticed was the incredible long line up just order which is a good sign. They ordered me an OJ. My first impression of it was \"Holy hell, this is super sweet and creamy\". Reason why I gave it 3 stars is personally, it didnt really hit me as this is the best OJ drink ever. I was given a high expectation and was disappointed that it didnt really hit me like I had expected. The drink was way too sweet. Havent  tried to cook food here yet since I was already full. I would give this place a try again in the future. Maybe next time around, I would order some food to go with the super sweet OJ that would probably put sugary diabetic coma."}
{"text":"I don't think there is a single Montrealer who hasn't been here and if they haven't than they really aren't a true Montrealer anyway so it really doesn't matter.  Orange Julep is a must try and a must return often type of place, although its open all year around these days it will always symbolize summer comfort food for me. I can't call it a good summer if I haven't enjoyed one of their amazing burgers, fries, poutine, hotdog, or poutines all washed down with the one and only orange julep shake, which can be likened to but never compared with an orange julius. Just writing this review makes me need my fix so I'll be hitting them up this week for sure and you should too"}
{"text":"I never come here. I think it's more for tourists. So whenever my folks are in town, they would insist on coming here. More then once! I don't really get why they love the orange juice so much. I mean it consist of mainly water, sugar and orange juice. I even wonder if it's real orange juice. The \"juice\" is so clear and way too sweet! So sweet that it hurts my teeth! And it's expensive too. I mean, for what it is! The only good item on the menu are the fries and poutine. That's all. So if you are visiting Montreal, please come take a look. But don't expect to sip on the best orange juice of your life. You'll be very disappointed. Service is ok. Nothing more, nothing less. You might wait in line during the weekends. Like i said earlier. Not my kinda place ;)"}
{"text":"Upon asking for food recommendations from a friend who lives in Montréal she quickly suggests Julep. It was a very breezy Saturday afternoon when we stopped by. Seeing as there's only outdoor seating we were freezing our butts off while enjoying our julep and poutine.   The medium julep is a decent size and as other reviewers have mentioned there must be a little something else in the julep. I just don't believe that it's made from only oranges. It's a good drink regardless.   I didn't think that the poutine was anything special. It tastes like other poutine I've had.   Looking at the menu the combos seemed to be a decent price. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Montréal."}
{"text":"I guess Orange Julius hasn't crossed into Canada yet eh? For the American yelpers think of the julep was an orange Julius made without ice. For my Hawaii people think of a melted orange bang. Those are the closest things that come to mind that can draw some kind of comparison. While I prefer to have an Orange bang over a Julep I am sure that my opinion would be different if I was a native Montrealer.   To me it's the little things that make the difference. Believe it or not, I have never had a hot dog on a New England Hot Dog Roll (you know the buttery toasted ones that lobster rolls are served on) and man it makes a world of difference. If this is how they made hot dogs for the past few decades, it's no wonder why they are still here!  Whenever I am on travel I love coming to places like this. Pure unadulterated slice of gut busting food from yesteryear. Sometimes you just need to eat and reminisce about a time where we didn't need to know the nutritional value and just enjoyed the experience of going out and eating.    Thank you Montreal Yelp for letting me know about this little slice of your childhood history!."}
{"text":"Man this place is a landmark kind of hard to miss a big orange round building in Montreal.  Gotta have the orange julep all I would buy i never tried to the food since that drink would be all I get everytime I go up and forgot about the rest.  It's an addicting little drink....... I tried to replicate it and failed miserably I guess its one of those that cant be duplicated.  But anyone visiting for the first time should go and try it."}
{"text":"Ce snack bar est un véritable institut à Montréal  il doit exister depuis une cinquantaine d'années ( je n'ai pas fait de recherches ) mais je ne pense pas exagérer. Comme la plupart des vieilles institutions il y a des plus et des moins. Orange Julep n'a jamais évolué au niveau de son menu. Par contre il offre un jus d'orange bien sucré qui a bon goût!"}
{"text":"Ok well this place definitely does not earn 5 stars. Anyone that think it does is crazy. The orange julep is ok. The burger was average and it cost way to much for what I can get in this town for 10$. I can say this is worth trying one time but mostly for the orange julep drink. I give it 3 stars, no lower or higher. There are better places out there for the money your spending."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, nasty nasty nasty. This was another one of the bf's great idea. \"Oh, you planned the whole trip. I only have two requests - poutine and orange julep.\" How could I turn him down?  Traffic was horrendous and we were happy to finally arrive under the giant orange ball. It looked like it belongs in LA. It didn't look particularly clean but that didn't deter the bf.  The verdict? The orange julep was more watery than he expected and the burger looked worse than McDonald's. The fries were soaked in oil. Eww."}
{"text":"Un incontournable du junk good à Montreal: leurs frites graisseuses sont incroyables!! On mange à l'extérieur, alors y aller les beaux jours d'été !!"}
