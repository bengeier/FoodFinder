{"text":"Nice and cozy  place, food was very good, service was excelent, would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"I've never waited so long for food in my life. I was in this place for over 4 hours! I was with a lot of people, but it still seemed like an excessive wait.

On to the food. I ordered the assorted meat platter (i forget the name). The sweetbreads were grilled and excellent. So was the tripe. The flank steak was probably the next best thing on the plate, not bad, but nothing mind blowing. Everything else was just average. The blood sausage was interesting, but lacked flavour. For the price (over $60 with a glass of wine per person), I'm not sure I would return. Maybe just for the sweetbread."}
{"text":"Things here went from good to bad. I'm latino and I know that Argentina's beef is second to none... so if I go to an argentinian restaurant I'll order beef. From when we sat down to the time I paid the huge bill, nearly 3 hours passed, and I spent no more than 20 minutes on the main dish. We waited A LOT, and there were just 3 accupied tables that night. The empanadas were good, although a the Ham and Cheese one was a bit salty. For $7+ I was expecting bigger size or more units. We had the Parrilla Argentina for 2 for main dish, at nearly $50 it represents little value. We ordered it withouth Blood Sausage (we hate that kind of food, we also hate glands and other organs... we like meat!). After at least one hour the BBQ came in, sporting a shiny blood sausage... there was another suspicious stuff... it looked like a big ear... I steered clear of eat and later I learned it was tripe (did I say I hate that?)... funny, it wasn't in the dish description. The beef was ok... the chicken was undercooked, and what's the point of having Argentinian beef on an electric grill? If is not charcoal is not gouig to cut it! Is like eating cavir with a plastic spoon. I proceeded to try what looked like pork... I started cutting it but there was \"fat\" everywhere, not a single chunk of meat for my knife and fork... I finally was able to get a decent piece, put in in my mouth and the texture was very unsettling... I stopped chewing it and just swallowed it. I asked what was the name of that weird meat in my native Spanish, and when I heard \"mollejas\" (how that can be called \"sweetbread\"? I was expecting SWEET BREAD) I just wanted to throw up, in fact I wanted to throw up and lost the apetite for the next three days... I'm not exagerating. (Imagine that food you'll never eat, now imagine that  you ate that thinking it was something else, and now imagine the waiter all excited telling you it was that food you'll never eat!). Ordered another pop to wash it down a bit further (warning: Each coke is like $3 and you'll have to pay for every one of them... why are restaurants still doing this?). I ordered a dessert again to try to forget the  sweetbread texture, the Flan de Chocolate blanco tasted like nothing, and I mean nothing... no sweet, no sour, no falvour at all... was like water... and the Dulce de Leche had a strange flavour at the end that made me think of the cow's rear end.
Recommendations for the restaurant: Don't assume that everyone likes and knows what sweetbread and trip and blood sausage is.  Stop charging more than one pop per person. Use Charcoal. Get more personnel so people don't have to wait that long. They speak spanish in Argentina, so use spanish names for the food with a brief explanation/translation in english. Make sure you test the food before serving it (no, not the same one you're serving, take  a sample form somwhere else).
Recommendations for the guests: IS a lovely place, service is OK, but food is overpriced, very overpriced."}
