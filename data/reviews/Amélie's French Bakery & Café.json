{"text":"I love Amelie's it's one of those places I always take people when I find out they have never been to Charlotte. The food is good but what does it for me is the atmosphere. It's just a good place to just hang out with old friends"}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit and chat...very hip and casual vibe.  Lots of pastry selections.  Good coffee...or even stronger beverages if you are so inclined.  I like to get the pot of tea and just chill.  You never feel rushed or like you are taking up space.  They have a variety of seating options, from tables and chairs, to couches and comfy seats.  I have seen folks sitting and playing board games...how fun!

The leek soup is delicious, and their macaroons are delightful, with a variety of flavors that changes.  Go for the Lemon if you get a chance."}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed Amelie's?  The salted caramel brownie is one of the best things in Charlotte.  I was so sad when I found out that I was gluten intolerant...and then they started making a GF salted caramel brownie!  I thought they must have given me the wrong one, because I could not tell the difference.  The Amelie's in NODA stays busy, but I have never had to wait too long at the Pineville-Matthews location."}
{"text":"What a nice place! While in Charlotte visiting family, I decided to yelp a place to find a tasty birthday cake. After getting some sushi we drove down to Amelie's, and for a while I was concerned that we were headed in the wrong direction - the area was pretty sparse and industrial looking. But when we pulled up and I saw the cute little porch I knew it would be good. 

The interior is artsy and adorable, with a touch of class. I'm a big fan of the various chandeliers they had and of course - the sweets. What yummy looking sweets, served up by a friendly staff. I got a free eclair for it being my birthday, and chose a big fat chocolate cappucino/rum cream cake. Then we had some french pressed coffee. Overall, I'd say the sweets I had were decent, not amazing. The cake was a bit dry but still yum. If I'm ever in Charlotte again though I'll definitely have to bring some friends to this place, The atmosphere is simply lovely. The best part? It's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"As a coffee addict, I can be pretty critical of bakeries/coffee shops etc. Amelie's impressed me. They offer an array of hot and cold beverages that are artfully crafted but available in limited and small sizes. 
The ambiance is great for socializing, studying, or just sitting and people-watching. I love that it is open 24/7, 365 days a year - you can't beat that convenience! 
The pastries are too numerous to review individually here, but are all delicious. I have dreams about their twice-baked croissants and their Neopolitan pastries are perfect to share. They are adding more gluten-free options (like the salted caramel brownies) but right now there are only a few. 
Overall, Amelie's is an awesome venue for pretty much anything (you can also rent out the back rooms for bridal/baby showers etc.) and is only on an upward trajectory. I would definitely recommend it for people of all ages and walks of life :)"}
{"text":"I love Amelie's (although I'm pretty sure EVERYONE does) - amazing creme brulee, tasty lattes, and the best croissants I've had outside of France (honorable mentions to Cafe Vanille in Boston and La Boite a Pain in Quebec, though).

The only negative is that the line is usually incredibly long, but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Meh. The desserts were okay. All I could taste was butter with a slight flavoring to the brownies. 
The macaroons were very chewy/ borderline stale. 
The mini chocolate- Irish coffee flavored thing was delicious. If I returned, those would be my first and only choice for the options. Everything else looked delicious. I must have gone at a strange time to have the experience I did. I have hopes the other items had a better flavor profile."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times to the NoDa, Pineville and Uptown locations.  The uptown location is the least \"Amélie-esque\" of the three.  It doesn't have that funky, eclectic vibe and decor as the others do.  We enjoy the atmosphere at the NoDa location the best, but Pineville is our closer option (incidentally, this location is populated mostly by women at lunch time and in the afternoon).  Aside from the pastries (which are more reasonably priced than most places offering French pastries), I like to get a hot, toasty breakfast sandwich on a baguette.  It tastes great, the baguette is warm and crusty and it just hits the spot each time.  I also enjoy their salads.  Amélie's is also a great place to take out-of-town visitors!  Ours always love it!"}
{"text":"We enjoy stopping by when in that part of town, but not to go out of our way.  Bakery items are good but not \"to die for\".  Atmosphere is enjoyably coffee shop chic."}
{"text":"I really want to like this location but every time I've gone it's been a bad experience. I go to the NoDa location often so was excited about it being closer to where I live. First visit to the Pineville location was opening weekend. Air conditioning didn't work. Ok, I get it, still working out the kinks. Second visit, I ordered a full order of mushroom tart. Got what looked like only a half order so I asked one of the employees. Since they don't give itemized receipts I was questioned by the employee as to whether or not I did indeed order a full. By the time they checked their records and brought the other half of the mushroom tart out, my family was already done with lunch and we were all waiting to leave. Also, the mushroom tart I got this time had cheese on it. My first half order did not have the cheese on it. Third visit, got a Napolean for the first time and it was completely frozen. Today was my fourth visit and probably my last. I invited a couple of my friends to join me for late morning coffee. We went up to the counter and waited patiently behind a customer that had a order 3 boxes of pastries. There were two employees helping with the order. Both employees saw us but never acknowledged us. Two other employees came up and talked to the two employees at the counter and didn't acknowledge us either. Another customer came in behind us and was helped by one of the employees that was just standing around completely skipping over my friend and I that had been waiting for over 10 mins for someone to help us. None of the employees apologized or anything to us. I ordered a cafe marcotter, which was never called after 15 minutes and I see the barrista standing around and chatting with other customers. I finally asked the barrista if he had an order for me. He looked on the printer and said oh yes, sorry about that and proceeded to make my drink right then. I'm not sure what's going on with this location but to come in every time and have something wrong is really disappointing. I'm not one to complain or cause a scene at the store but after 4 times I felt it needed to be addressed. I'm not sure what's going on at this store but customer service is just not up to par."}
{"text":"We just added this place to our must visit every time we're in town! A quick walk from the Westin and the Omni Hotel made it even more fun, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Light and airy pastries. Very eclectic atmosphere and decor. My only issue was the wait. The line went around to the back of the bakery, but moved quickly. I had a slice of blackberry cake. My friend had the lavendar lemon mini with buttercream. Delish!"}
{"text":"The croissant with ham and spinach is very nice. Also tried Almond cake which is also very good despite a bit small in size"}
{"text":"This place has unique character to it! Best thing it is open 24*7, and you can find variety of wonderful choices and can have amazing time with your special someone or in a group. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Place looks like it was decorated by a bipolar grandmother during a manic episode, but if you can get past that, the place is very laid back, lots of baked sweets, so-so coffee (one free refill for the study folk =) and the baguette is SPOT ON. Amazing baguette. Get the baguette. Get it with manchego and sausage for breakfast or they also just sell them with a side of butter and jam. They don't advertise too much that the place is open 24 hrs too!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Amelie's French Bakery. You can find me there anytime of day, even 3am working on a website or clients SEO. They have the best Asparagus Leek Soup and all the goodies are to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 3/5 stars because the cake I purchased tasted like it had been refrigerated too long. I would suggest calling ahead a few days to have a cake made, which was my stupid mistake. But really they should be more diligent in ensuring that cakes are thrown away before they start tasting weird. 

My boss actually bought some pastries from Amelies that were pretty good which prompted this cake purchase. 

Not the biggest fan but there are some goodies at this bakery."}
{"text":"My little brother's wife was determined to take me to this French bakery, and I must admit it was my speed.  I ordered a mini lemon, raspberry tart and a \"create your own\" sandwich.  I chose the croissant for bread, the turkey for meat, and mozzarella for cheese. Although the sandwich was not filling and there was not an opportunity to order anything with it other than French pastries, I could not complain.  Everything was fresh, and I spent $9.00 including my bottle water.  

The atmosphere was quirky and no two things seem to match which emphasized the quirkiness.  The lady who served the pastries was well-educated about the pastries, friendly, and full of \"I love my job\" kind of energy. By the time I arrived with my party of three at 11:08 pm, the line had snaked to the back of the establishment. Even though the line was rather intimidating, it moved fairly quickly, and that was impressive to me.
When my turkey and mozzarella croissant was ready, a server was calmly walking around looking for me.  Once again, impressed. 

 Final thoughts:  I will go back the next time I am visiting in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Open twenty four hours and to top it off fresh baked goods? I'm sold...I love this place..they have this butternut squash spaghetti and it yells awesomeeeeee! Mellow and low key my type of place."}
{"text":"best baguettes I've found in a long time, i stock up for the week.

not a big sweets eater, but my favorites is the blueberry cream cheese danish - them blueberries are huge and just pop in your mouth! not too sweet.

and the apple caramel three layered torte - oh....sooo yummy, and again not too sweet.

ordering their cakes is highly recommended for your next event.

overall, it's a \"bit\" pricey but it's worth it to me because i keep going back.  

i love the ambience, very ecclectic and gives you that french-cafe feel, or even a So-Ho feel.  great place to meet up with friends or start a day/evening out."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 solid stars because the place is a bit pricy. What? This place is open 24 hrs and 7 days a week? Good news for me...for this is definitely a great place to satisfy my midnight cravings. 
I ordered a French Soda, two small fruit tarts, and one Macaroon. The Macaroon was chewy and perfect..one of the best I've tried so far. The decor was quirky, kind of reminded me of Marie Antoinette. I had the
most difficult time choosing what I wanted because EVERYTHING looked yummy! The service was great and the atmosphere had a good vibe. I will definitely be coming back and this I am bringing my 4 year
old to have some Macaroons."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very eclectic. Always good food. The drinks are small, but that's only a problem because they are delicious.everything I have ever had there is great!"}
{"text":"My first time there and I will definitely come again . Everyone was very  nice and the lady at the bakery took her time and was patient in describing the different products . I bit into them and was amazed . It was so moist that it melted in my mouth! Hmm mmm ! I'd also like to add that I've spend 100's on professional cakes for birthdays weddings etc and none of them were as good as just a cupcake at this establishment! I hope they cater or make cakes to order . I'd love to start getting special made cakes here :) . Last but not least it is a little pricey as I did spend 12 on a cupcake a small pastry and a drink but it was worth it ! I've spent that and didn't eat all of my food before !"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and the lavender lemonade was delicious. Also got a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant. The croissant was light and flakey. Perfect. The chicken salad sandwich had a nice pepper kick to counter the sweetness of the bread. Very enjoyable and friendly employees."}
{"text":"Funky vibe with mismatched furniture and the BEST coffee! You can watch the pastry chefs while they work and enjoy tasty pastry"}
{"text":"First time here over this past weekend.  Surprised at how busy it was in the middle of a Saturday afternoon - line was at least a dozen people deep.  Moved quickly but felt rushed to make decisions in order not to hold up those behind us.  Menu boards jammed, difficult to read.  Display cases attractive.  Enjoyed the salted caramel brownie (very nice but very small), croissant (not as fluffy as expected, perhaps to serve as a sandwich roll), almond cake (lovely) and coconut macaroon (best of the bunch).  The salted caramel apple cider was over the top sweet and I wouldn't do it again.  The french press espresso was so good it may have converted the non-coffee drinker in our group.  Parking is convenient in the lot out front (nice plus is NoDa).  Looking forward to the Carmel Commons location opening as that is a lot closer for me."}
{"text":"The eclairs were a little dry though the chocolate pastry cream was just right. The salted caramel brownie was the specialty and 5 stars - a unique almost melting chocolate base (egg whites??) with an equal amount of caramel on top. The brownie base and the caramel top were equally good and mixed together in a candy bar swirl when eating. The lemon pastry was fine. Lemon and lime pies had come out of the back when we were there are looked really good.

The atmosphere is fun with mismatched seating and hip lighting with something to see in any direction. The service was very friendly and helpful with patience in explaining any of the baked goods as well as providing helpful recommendations. Prices were a little expensive with small pastries around 2.50 and larger single serving cakes around 5.00."}
{"text":"These were the worse macarons I've had in a long time! Smh. Extremely HARD, and for $2 a pop"}
{"text":"Best eclairs in Charlotte, hands down! Also great for a light lunch.. I usually order chicken salad on a croissant. However, I hardly go anymore because the line is too long. If they could find a way to expedite the ordering process, I would eat there all the time :)"}
{"text":"The food quality is outstanding, but the service last Sunday around 2pm was some of the worst customer service I have ever had. I ordered two coffee drinks and was treated like an idiot because I didn't know that a \"standard shot\" is actually two shots of espresso. I ordered one drink with an added shot. She corrected me telling me that drink is called something different when served in a cup vs mug, and when I received the drink from the barrista, she called it something different entirely!  Who knew coffee could be so complicated?! 

The person at the counter spoke down to me, then went to chat with her coworkers while I waited. The drinks were not started until after they finished chatting. I asked for clarification on how many shots I was getting and she just did not do a good job explaining and made me feel like a moron. I hope they correct this problem, because I really want to keep going there."}
{"text":"Currently sitting here for lunch. Took 25 minutes to wait in line and order. There were about 10 people ahead of me the place is nearly empty and the size of an airplane hanger. Tons of staff standing around doing nothing while two people take orders and three cook. Took another 15 minutes to get a cold sandwich and side salad. The side salad has 6 pieces of lettuce in it. What a horribly run operation"}
{"text":"Lots of gluten-free options and awesome crème brûlée (also gluten-free)."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and seasonal items! A variety of tea options. A good spot for studying or late night snacks. Would recommend this spot for sure!"}
{"text":"I know people really love this place. I wish I could be one of them. On the one hand, I absolutely love the decor and the ambiance.  On the other hand, I have never been anything but underwhelmed by their food. The coffee is great, but the bakery items are only visually appealing. I have heard from most patrons that the Salted Caramel Brownie is amazing, but I've never tried it because I'm not a big caramel fan. So, if you are, I'd recommend trying it. I definitely think you should go here just to experience the atmosphere, but don't expect to be impressed by the food. It's probably great as a dessert stop after a few dinner cocktails, though. So, that's something."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. We came on three separate occasions, but only actually ordered twice because the line around 7PM on a weekday was absurdly large. Between the huge line and the Yelp reviews, we had incredible expectations. It just wasn't really an impressive dessert, and the huge crowd just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Stale macarons and stale service. There were dirty dishes sitting all over the place and the pistachio macaron tasted 4 years old."}
{"text":"Me and my family used to love to go here for special occasions (it's a bit of a drive from their house). But since my dad is now lactose intolerant and I'm vegan it's we can't really get anything anymore. Just a drink or a soup every once in a while. I would love for them to have one or two vegan dessert options for those of us who don't do animal products. I'm not picky, I'll take anything!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this cute french pastry shop. We went for lunch and had delicious simple baguette/croissant sandwiches that were fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the turkey brie croissant. The thai soup with chunks of squash was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning. The salted caramel brownie was delicious, a complete sugar high! Overall, one of the better bakeries I have been to!"}
{"text":"I adore this place! During my weekend visit to Charlotte a friend and I stopped here for coffee, which was amazing. We didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that. The atmosphere was great and the employees were super helpful. Plus, they're open 24 hours? Genius! Wish they had a place like this in DC!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit in Charlotte for a cup of coffee, tea or adult beverage with a little treat on the side. Food is yummy and the service and people are friendly."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. I've tried many of the desserts, soups and sandwiches. They are superb!

I don't frequent Amelie's as often as I should. Whether it's desert for a dinner, something to spoil yourself or an unctuous soup to curl up with on a cold day - there is something waiting for you."}
{"text":"Came in on a week day right before lunch. Walked right up and ordered immediately. The sea salted Carmel brownie is the bomb!! I don't even want to know what they put in that thing of awesome. Can't wait to get back and take out of town friends."}
{"text":"Good place.  Lots of options.  One of the best coffee choices.  Not just any place that sells baloney.  Can be a bit crowded at times.  Good place to visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food at this location!! I have only tried the sandwiches and salads yet i have NEVER been disappointed. The Rock Hill location has a limited menu though..."}
{"text":"Ahh, such a disappointment. Long lines, mediocre food, overpriced food & coffee, super limited coffee milk options...I wanted to like this place, but definitely never coming back. My husband got his coffee right away in a mug, mine came 10 mins later in a to go cup, and it was wrong. As a former manager of a coffee shop, I understand the challenges associated with the job...but this is not that hard. Step it up, Charlotte, you can do better than this."}
{"text":"Love this place! Salted caramel brownie and their veggie leek soup are killer"}
{"text":"24 hours a day of Yummy!

I can stop at Amelie's anytime for a delicious meal or treat.  I can grab something and take it to go or sit and relax for hours in the unique atmosphere and feel like I'm in another land.  Food is fantastic, people are great and it's always open, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love this place! We are so happy there is one in Rock Hill now too!"}
{"text":"I must be honest, I was hesitant at first to try this place. I can't pronounce the name, I was sure that it was a glorified Panera. However, a friend of mine asked me to meet him there, so I obliged. 

When I first walked in, I loved the eclectic style that was everywhere with the mismatched furniture that all just effortlessly \"went\" together. The place was packed and so was the pastry display case. My mouth was watering as soon as I walked in. The sweet and savory smells that waft throughout the entire venue are irresistable. I had the portabella and leek soup with a hot chocolate. Incredible! The goat cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor that just made the soup so perfect and the hot chocolate was real chocolate with steamed milk. It is the kind of food you crave when you are looking for comfort after a bad day.

Since that first experience, I do try to go back as often as I can. The salted caramel brownies are amazing and they even have the recipe online for people to try. This establishment really shows what true craftsmanship and quality should be like within the food industry and I always feel like their number one customer!"}
{"text":"Do you like friendly, professional, efficient service?  Then this place is not for you!  Do you like clean bathrooms?  This place is not for you. Do you like staff that dress in exercise clothes like they just rolled in sweaty from the YMCA to make your café au lait with a side of everlasting wait?  Then yes, this is your place. 

Maybe Amelie's is going for that sort of novelty place where people go because the service is poor--like dick's last resort to something like that. Or...French people have a reputation for being rude, so maybe they're just extending the French theme to the staffing and customer service aspects of the restaurant.

Come on people. It was such a nice thing to see a place with at least a little bit of character and creativity open in south Charlotte--we have so little funk down here. Maybe that was why it was so much of a disappointment to have such a bad experience.  You have vast potential--your decor and environment is really cool. You have decent and different food. Your outdoor seating is nice. Why have staff that doesn't care about customers or customer service?  Be kind to your customers. Get your processes in order so customers don't wait 20 minutes for a specialty coffee. Be professional and look professional and take pride in what you do.  Do that and people may actually want to come back."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Amélie's and I was impressed with the food and the service! We love the Manager JP, he's so sweet and friendly! The ambiance is lovely and quaint! 

We ordered Roast Beef & Manchego (It's delicious but it's not Oohlala kind of delish), a side of spinach & artichoke soup (I love love love the lightness of the cream soup, and lots of spinach and artichoke), and Mushroom & Chèvre crepe (This is superb in taste and quality of ingredients, very special and unique).

Now for dessert, I love the fresh fruit tarts! They're decadent, just the right sweetness and tartness. Just love it! My goddaughter loves the Salted Caramel Brownies! I had them too and they're finger licking good! There must be a reason since they sold 11 Million of them so far. Overall, it was an experience to remember. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Salted Carmel brownie tort. YUM!!!  The best place in Charlotte with friends anytime!!! open 24/7 every day!!!  Pride of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came across this little gem one night while looking for somewhere to study.  I didn't realize a 24 hour bakery existed here!!!  Their salted caramel brownies are to die for and the atmosphere is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Great food and service with a smile! 

I didn't know about this location, I just happened upon it and I'm really glad I did. The staff was friendly and attentive. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a newer location, large, plenty of seating. Compared to the NODA location this location is more wide open and has a cleaner feel. I walked here, however there is a parking deck attached to the building. The selection was consistent with the NODA location and seemed the same quality.  It was busy during lunch but the line moves fast. I had a chicken salad sandwich and the croissant was fresh. I opted for a small pecan tart--it was okay I felt that the crust was overlooked and tastes burnt."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a great little place to meet friends and have a latte. However its popularity has taken away most of its charm as it is often over crowded with long lines late into the evening. The prices are moderate to expensive. Many of the pastries are now frozen and not freshly made locally or in the café. Over all though still an enjoyable experience, just not very often for me at this point."}
{"text":"This rating is only based upon one (OK two, well three, including the take home piece but who's counting) slices of cake I got to indulge in while attending a recent baby shower. 

It was delicious. I think it was a lemon and raspberry filling. I'm not sure. I mean, when i bite into a dessert I like, I kind of forget, who? what ? where? when? 
This one took me there! 
The only thing I am sure of is they ordered the cake from here. I confirmed this after the slapped me out of my sweet delusional state."}
{"text":"I mean the foods great but pricy, it's NODA, what do you expect?  But you cant beat a 24 hour bakery that exists in a town where everything closes at midnight.  Also the coffee is fantastic."}
{"text":"My favorite bakery. I usually do not like deserts. Amelie's has my true love of desert there."}
{"text":"Breakfast baguette was huge. The bread was perfect. Also the fruit danish was very tasty and filling. Coconut macaroons were sooo rich. Great place. With a hot coffee, this west coast guy thought he had died and gone to heaven."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!  The best pastries I've ever eaten!  They were kind enough to pack up a few in a box for the trip back to California (they were still great)!  Light, flakey, crispy, yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious-looking selections of pastries and desserts. Unfortunately I haven't tried any of them, as they are not vegan. However the few vegan soups I have had here have been absolutely delicious. Kind of pricey though, so it isn't an every week kind of treat.
Usually seating is available if you avoid peak times."}
{"text":"Cappuccino's here are so tasty and so are the desserts. This is a fun trendy cafe to hit after a dinner in Charlotte. The decor is fun to look at and their little gift shop is cute too."}
{"text":"Just ate at Amelie's French Bakery.  My wife and I loved it!  The interior was open and had a nice feel to it.  Overall, the whole place a cool vibe - also, great eclairs!  I experienced no hiccups in service or food (and this was only the second week they have been open).  The place was busy for lunch - but food and service flowed nicely!
Great job, Amelie's!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!! The food and desserts are exquisite!! I love the spinach asparagus leek soup, the chicken salad croissant and the breakfast sandwiches. 

Regarding the sweets, this place is heaven. The salted caramel brownie is a staple. I love the chocolate peanut butter petit four and the palmiers. The hot chocolate topped with Caramel is also excellent. 

I go here any time of the day. It's good for lunch with friends or a late night treat after hanging out on Saturday night . It is open 24hrs/day and has free wifi. It has an eclectic, artistic atmosphere. This is one of my favorite places to go in Charlotte. I always bring out of town visitors here."}
{"text":"If heaven was filled with desserts, it would be called Amelie's! The salted caramel brownie, raspberry,  mixed berry (red & purple) & cinnamon ganache are a MUST!! For drinks the lavender lemonade is amazing!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a lovely place for a relaxing afternoon. Stop in and pick up some sweets from their bakery, or bring a book or a friend and settle in with their wonderful french press coffee. Even if the line appears long when you first walk in, don't be intimidated because their treats and coffee are well worth the wait. The service is excellent, the aesthetic is original and vaguely dadaist, and the atmosphere is very pleasant. If you're in the Charlotte area, stop in soon because Amelie's will probably become your new favorite place for a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This has recently became my number one place to do work outside of the office. Ample seating, open 24 hrs a day, decent coffee and good soup, these make for a good alternative work environment.

They have tons of sweets, yet I don't think a single one of them is vegan so no good there. The bread you get along with your soup is animal friendly though :). The staff is all quite nice and they do well in the unique layout of the shop. Tons of space inside and out.

Their coffee is not the greatest but it's decent and I wish they had more options for us picky animal lovers, but it's still a rather nice place."}
{"text":"No trip to NODA is complete without hitting Amelie's. You feel transported in time and space while eating a quality French Pastry. The servers always try to assist with explanations and answering questions regarding their offerings. Hard to resist even if you are not very hungry."}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Amelie's but left with the thought that I will not return. Paid top dollar for 2 pastries plus 2 caramel brownies. Not a problem if they are out of this world. Not. The lemon meringue tasted like something which could be bought at Harris Teeter. NOT a compliment. The caramel brownies were so sweet they were inedible according both my husband and me. I have visited the NoDa location once and had a good memory of their pastries but the fruit pastries on Carmel Rd location looked not fresh. Shame on you Amelie's. All hopes for a decent bakery on the south side of town is gone."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Amelies! I always get their Turkey and Brie sandwich with a cup of their steaming hot coffee. They are open 24 hours a day and their staff is so friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great atmosphere and even better food! :)"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find!! This place is huge and the decoration is so Alice in wonderland. I love it! The desserts are great too. Love the homemade sodas."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that a year ago I would've given Amelie's 5 stars. 

I think the problem is that Amelie's is pretty much the only one of its kind in Charlotte and it's now too crowded and understaffed (or staffed with people who don't care?). Every time I go there is a huge line, dirty plates on every table and a mass of people. My favorite bakery items are the twice baked chocolate croissants. The last few times I've been they were either out of them (that happened twice) or they said they had them and then gave me the twice baked almond croissant by mistake (realized that when I got home) or they had them so I was so excited that I got two! - they were both stale. Really disappointing. Also one night we got a Napoleon to share there, we tried to take a bite of it and it was frozen. I should've said something to one of the people behind the counter but I was just fed up at this point and felt like they wouldn't do anything about it anyways. I just asked for a box to take it home to defrost. 

I used to be really excited about going to Amelie's, now I just try to avoid it. I do have hope that it will go back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"Amazing Atmosphere. Nice place to hang out with Friends.
Didn't like the Macarons over here as much as I like them. The best one I had in georgetown, washington dc."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in Charlotte's NoDa district. Open 24 hours a day, it is definitely a great place to grab coffee and some yummmmy desserts after dinner or if you can't sleep. The eclectic decor adds charm to this place, and you will always find an interesting crowd. If you're into people watching, you will definitely have a good time, although no one is going to be watching you. I only went here a few times while living in Charlotte, but each time I went I left happy and content in my stomach and in spirits."}
{"text":"A lovely respite in uptown. Love the decor - so peppy and uplifting but then if you put me in front of that much sweet stuff I will feel happy any ways. Love their macaroons but love their cappuccino even more. One of the rare places in Uptown with decent coffee. I've had breakfast here and it's decent but nothing amazing and they lose one star in that but overall I still like the place. I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"A bit over priced, but very tasty as a treat once in awhile."}
{"text":"At first I was taken with the Ambience. The pastries are works of art. And some of the pastries are delightful in taste. But all in all, I find this place overrated and overpriced. Sure, some pastries warrant a price that reflects the time involved in their making, but I've found myself and my family eating some only because they cost so damned much, there is no way I'm throwing them out. 

It is, however, a fun place to meet for business or hang with friends. Definitely more eclectic, than luxurious in decor. 

The primary reason I am not eager to return is the lack of love from the staff. When I am paying top dollar for something, I insist that at least pretend to value my business."}
{"text":"Great bread, delicious soups. The pastries and desserts look devine. Cool, laid back setting with lots of options for seating. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have no idea why Amelie's in Carmel Commons has anything less than four star reviews. I've been to this location (as well as the Noda location) several times and have never had a bad experience. I've ordered pastries, sandwiches, soups, drinks and all have been fantastic.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of the Amelie's in CC because it feels more relaxed and is usually less crowded than the one in Noda (though it has still been busy each time I've been here). Definitely a nice place to sit and catch up with friends or hangout and enjoy lunch."}
{"text":"Cool place. Get the salted caramel brownie! Best I've had."}
{"text":"Pastry is amazing but the breakfast sandwich was a little salty."}
{"text":"Came here to experience NoDa, had a bit of a hipster vibe that calls to me. The fruit pastry was delicious and I got some serious work done with their coffee!"}
{"text":"Amelies is one of my favorite places to go in the Charlotte area. It is different, always open, and I love to go just to try something new. My only concern is that it could be cleaner. Almost every time I have ever been to Amelies the tables haven't been cleaned. My only suggestion would be to have someone constantly sweeping and wiping down tables or just checking the atrium/inside for dirty floors and tables. Honestly who wants to eat somewhere that doesn't feel clean?
I also wonder about how long some of the treats are sitting in the display.  I went yesterday and ordered a croissant from the display and it was dry and hard. I also tried four different macaroons but all except for one tasted like it had been sitting for a while so it had a weird and stale after taste. 
Great idea in this place but needs way more of a managerial touch."}
{"text":"Great desserts but can be a bit expensive. I go here when I have a craving for something like creme brûlée but don't want to go out to eat. Great assortment."}
{"text":"Great place with authentic French pastries, charcuterie  and decor.  Best backery I have found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"On weekends, always a long line!!! The first time we went we stood on a line that wrapped around the place and waited about 30-40 mins.  Once you get up to the counter though, the staff is extremely attentive and never make you feel rushed.

I love their chocolate mousse and their iced coffee.  Sadly they consistently run out of my fiances favorite (Napolon), so I guess that means they are really good!

The location itself has a cute, ecclectic vibe.  Definately a nice spot to sit with some coffee and dessert.  I wish they had more outdoor space though.  On a nice day, there is never an open table!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!! This place is a most, me and my husband discovered this place while on vacation and looking for a late night snack, we now go every single time I come to Charlotte. The coffee and the sweets are soo good everything I tried was soo good, The place is soo chic I absolutely loved it and my daughter was amazed by all the pretty decorations it feels as if you're in a real French bakery, I recommend it. It was a great experience absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place, pastries are always fresh and many choices to choose from.  I love their ecclectic environment and the fact that they are 24 hours.  Their macaroons are the best in my opinion. Ive tried many different places and always still fall back to Amelie's."}
{"text":"Best bakery in town.  Great soup and homemade cheeses too.  Love the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We've been to to the Amelie's uptown on College St and on Pineville-Matthews Rd (51) and both are very good. The food is good and the desserts are excellent. Not a fancy restaurant but who cares, the food makes up for that."}
{"text":"My rating from this place is between a 3 and 5, but a solid 4 at all times once the experience is over. The painful line at night during the time everyone wants dessert is my reason for a 3, although a 5 when I'm hammered and get sobered up with some coffee and pastries! Good place to study as well, or get hit on by strange men with purple beards."}
{"text":"Great place to grab something sweet or just hang out at almost any hour of the day."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I had the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich with the mushroom onion soup. Delicious! At the bakery we bought napoleons, eclairs, and their famous salted caramel brownies. Atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Awesome music - Joy Division/Clash etc playing. Food is so good. I had a breakfast sandwich plus took a quiche to go (heavenly). Friendly folk and the decor was great. Busy and crowded on a Saturday morning but no problem getting a seat or sharing a table. No rush to leave this comfy place."}
{"text":"I come here more for the atmosphere than the food. With the exception of the palmiers and the twice baked croissants, I've had better. Everything I've tried was just OK, nothing to wow over.

My most recent visit was during breakfast and I had a ham, cheese, and egg croissant that, in my opinion, could've passed for a Burger King Croissan'wich. Enjoy your breakfast with the Cafe Fouette (4 shots of espresso, vanilla bean syrup, cream) and it saves the day!

One big disappointment for me during my visits has been the macarons. Sure they look nice and pretty all lined up in the case, but when you bite into them, it's not what a macaron experience should be. For some reason I keep ordering a few every time I come in hoping that \"this batch will be better than the last\", but it never turns out that way. They're hard shelled (like biting into a rock) and not as chewy or airy as I expect. For macarons that are done right, go to Renaissance Patisserie or Cafe Monte.

I can't leave out the salted caramel brownies. They're my wife's favorite and she contributes constantly to the sold tally they have on the wall. They are pretty decent. Grab a few when you're here!"}
{"text":"Long wait for pastries and drinks on a Sunday morning, but well worth it! Almond croissant, macarons, fouette', and French sodas are delicious!"}
{"text":"The infamous Amelie's, oh how i love you! This fine french bakery has been apart of my weekly routine for almost two years now. Their pastrys are consistantly amazing and the atmosphere is as quirky as they come. I love to come here with friends to hang out or while using their wi-fi:
 catching up on hw. 

Food: my poison are the little frenh style macarons. Absolutely deliscious! I craved them all summer while i was in oregon and when i came back i had to have one straight off the plane! Over the summer however it seems like the macarons got down sized... but the price stayed the same? While the flavors aren't as exciing as pix patiseiri in portland, they are still awesome. If ur lacking a sweet tooth get a bagete and a couple of their cheese spreads, half and quarter bagettes available. Coffee is awesome here by the way and some others notible confections are: salted carmel brownie, petite fours, mousse cups, and their soups are to die for.

Service and style: servers are rad, style of their own. Very eclectic and kinda makes me feel at home. The only thing that erks me is that when people come in who don't know what to order and clog up the line. There is a system here, please don't be a tourist for too long, especially if there is a million people behind u. LOVE THE DECOR!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One word: Delicious 
Two words: Great atmosphere 

My Two cents: 
Yummy in my tummy! Everyone should check out Amelie's Bakery located in NoDa. It's really more than a bakery and once you check it out you will understand why I say this. 


It's almost like hanging out at your cool (but eclectic) aunt's house who likes to whip up tarts, bear claws, breakfast sandwiches and more to tempt your tastebuds. I'm telling you about this place because you can treat it as an experience and swing by anytime to have an almost 9 1/2 weeks (remember that movie...HOT!) moment with a date or pick up treats for an everyday or special occasion. 


By now your mouth should be watering. Just remember these delicious items could be picked up at anytime since its open 24 hours a day (winning!!)."}
{"text":"Consitently great! Love going there late at night and getting a drink from Chris who is my favorite barista. Quality food, amazing pastries and great beverages. I also encourage you to try more than just their bakery items. Their soups like the Spicy Thai are absolutelty delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!  Having just moved to Charlotte exactly a month ago, I wanted to try Amelie's with all the accolades it gets.  But, I was very disappointed.  The croissant was nothing special (any local grocery store could have made it) and it had sweet taste to it.  All of the chicken salad inside was rough, chewy chicken.  The side salad I got with the half sandwich was good and made with fresh greens and it tasted like homemade salad dressing.  I thought the iced tea had a light fruity taste and was fresh brewed.  But, this is what through me...the orange macaron.  It was frozen and I opened it to see what the yummy filling looked like.  There was a tiny plop and that's it :(...posted the pic of my sad macaron under photos."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Amelie's for a while. I've seen them on Yelp 4 years ago when I first came to Charlotte but I've never been able to make it to one of their locations. It was just my luck that I saw this location open on my way to the convention center and they were open late so I was able to go after my meeting. First impressions, this place is huge. It's the largest french cafe I've seen. The atmosphere is great. The quirky french decor gives it a very charming feel. Everywhere you look, there is something that catches your eye. You can even see the workers preparing the baked goods through the large glass window into their kitchen. 

We tried a few small desserts and coffee drinks. First was the salted caramel brownie. It tasted good but was very sweet. Honestly it felt more like southern comfort food than french cafe. Next was the cream puff. It was filled a custard type cream and covered with chocolate. It was a little heavier than I expected but I still enjoyed it. We tried the bite size key lime meringue pie. That was actually my favorite bite. It was perfectly tart and the meringue was wonderfully light. And lastly was a passion fruit jelly topped with dark chocolate. The citrusy taste of the passion fruit went very well with the dark chocolate. 

I ordered a the 17 oz. French press dark roast coffee which was $4. It was good for 2 decent sized cups of coffee. They serve it with sugar and milk on the side. It had a perfect rich coffee taste. Made me want to get my own french press.

Overall this is a great place to hang out. Come with a group and share some desserts and drinks. They even have wine and beer."}
{"text":"Amelie's is really going downhill ... We used to adore this place ... Food quality, service, understaffed - has all gone down ... Maybe ego is the issue- maybe time for them to get a competitor so they care again. 

Only reason for two stars is some pastries are still yummy ... My chai latte was water downed yuck!"}
{"text":"A better-than-average bakery with wonderfully unusual atmosphere.

The pastries here are tasty- their eclairs are fruit tarts are especially delicious.  These are a nice snack, but nothing there is going to win any awards.

It's a great place to meet with friends and have some tasty treats."}
{"text":"3 Haikus about how much I love Amelie's:

1)
The bread, the pastries
Oh Amelie's Bakery
so much yummy food

2) 
I wish you were in
Chapel Hill.  I'd visit you
all the time because...

3)
Your ambience is
quirky and your food...your food
is quite amazing!"}
{"text":"Over a short period of time this place has gone to the dogs.  Napoleons and other butter cream pastries are now frozen as a matter of course. Beverage selection is poor and badly made coffee is accepted. Hipsters seem to accept the off hand service and lack of attention to detail as a badge of honor. Sadly the hype has done Amelie's a great disservice. I hope they can remedy it I used to love the place."}
{"text":"Went to uptown location. Ordered chicken salad croissant and it came on a baguette. just chicken salad slapped on this tough bread. no lettuce or anything. looked rather sad. Tasted ok but would have rather had croissant. didn't bother to ask for it to b changed as everyone else at table was almost finished."}
{"text":"I was pointed in the direction of Amelie's by a classmate who seemed to be a fan of the breakfast sandwiches, which he said were usually sold out if you don't get there early enough. I figured this was a sign that it was a good cafe/bakery. The first couple times I went, I bought an assortment of pastries to try - most were pretty great. I had given some to my parents to taste and my mother insisted her birthday cake come from there (I live 90 minutes away so this wasn't exactly easy planning.)  

On my next trip I purchased several french macarons and after getting them home, discovered a small hair sandwiched into 1 of them. I emailed Amelie's through facebook to explain what happened just to let them know someone needed to be a little more careful. I received an email back from Lynn profusely apologizing (including the same formatted apologies I've seen from her in response to some reviews on here) and offering to make up for the mishap. She gave me a separate email address to contact her with additional information. I emailed her back at the address she provided and told her I didn't want anything for free (I assumed the apology and promise to check their procedures was sincere) - and only wanted some help picking out a birthday cake for my mom as I was short on time. I never received any response. I followed up a few days later on facebook to see if she got my email and again, no response.

I sent a 3rd and final email December 26th (3 months after the fact) and finally got a response 8 days later apologizing for dropping the ball and offering a gift card to make up for it. I received another email this morning because she forgot to copy the gift card person on what happened.  Really? This is a comedy of errors that just isn't all that funny so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Lots of desserts to choose from, everything was just okay. I purchase all the different flavors of macaroons and the Neapolitan dessert. It was hard to find parking and a little crazy inside. Overall, I wasn't too impress."}
{"text":"This is a really unique restaurant. Its really quite. It feels like your walking through a house. The food is extravagant. Great place to study."}
{"text":"Your search for the perfect bakery in Charlotte ends here. I've never had a bad ANYTHING from Amelie's. If you want a delicious chocolate croissant at 3 in the morning, you go there. If you want the most amazing Salted Caramel Brownie that ever graced your tastebuds, you go there. Tarts, bearclaws, honey buns, coconut macaroons, petite gateaux, torte, french macarons.....YOU CAN\"T GO WRONG!! 

Very cute place...and their staff is super nice. Open 24/7/365.

GO THERE. GET YOU SOME. PUT IT IN YER FACE."}
{"text":"Their coffee is great. Treats are nice but a bit overpriced. I like their patio, but the inside feels like an open space warehouse. Their NoDa location has better ambience. Overall it is a great alternative to your regular Starbucks experience."}
{"text":"Today Halloween my son went inside and said Trick or Treat and they told him to pick two cookies then right before getting them he was told he had to pay for them.  How cruel can you be to a child?!?! I will never return to this business again. My son came back to the car crying and upset that he didn't have money and we explained to him that he didn't need money for Halloween. Maybe this business needs to put a sign that they aren't participating in Halloween or have candy because my child was very upset."}
{"text":"Well, it must be good because there was a long line (over 20 people) inside this morning at 11am. I will try it another time when not so crowded.

Update, I have not returned to this Amelie's, but really love the one on S. College Street and the one near Carmen Commons & 51 in South Charlotte. Great food & coffee."}
{"text":"This place is overrated, pastry quality is below average and the is comparable to NYC or DC's best pastry. the only good thing about this place is the 24hrs schedule."}
{"text":"SOOO WONDERFUL!
I am a nursing student so late night cafes with delicious coffee and even better sugary confections are exactly what I need!  The atmosphere is really eclectic and homey and I can spend hours there just getting my work done.  Made a few study buddy friends and, although it can get PACKED in a hurry, the people are really great about sharing space.  If you haven't been there YOU MUST GO!"}
{"text":"Desperate service, dirty tables, such a shame as I was really excited about this place opening. We love the NoDa location but it was a bit of a hike.  It was very quiet on a Sunday at 10.30am yet I had to wait over 10 mins for a baguette to go. The guy who took my order asked if I wanted it warmed and sliced, I said no but that's how I got it anyway. The management need to get their act together and train their staff."}
{"text":"Amelie a destination that I wanted to try for a while now. Made it there this afternoon  with the family expecting an awesome experience.  The decor is eclectic which I think makes this place. Their pastries was ok... Caramel fudge was good. Macaroons was average.  I felt rushed since it was our first time and we didn't know what to order. The one employee that help us was nice while the others seemed as if they didn't want to be there. 
It's neat that a bakery opens 24/7.
I will come back to give them another try, but may try their banquettes and croissants instead."}
{"text":"This is a great, \"Hmm, you know what? I need a quiche and chocolate croissant at three in the morning,\" place (because we all have been there). It's very french-eclectic as far as decor and seating. I also haven't met a menu item in there that I did not like (the croissant sandwiches are my favorite)."}
{"text":"such a pretty place, with great coffee and fantastic pastries and sandwiches.  Can be a bit confusing to know which line to get in to order, but other than that...great!"}
{"text":"Amelie's, I wanted to like you so badly. I've heard  the rave reviews for years and finally found myself back in the Charlotte area at lunchtime with family visiting from out of state.  From the servers in plain clothes who delivered our food (why didn't they at least have an apron on?) to the employee who carried the \"sanitized\" coffee mugs to the espresso machine by holding the rim against her hoodie/stomach, to the employee who picked her nose then handed my credit card back to me (I really hope you picked a winner), everything just fell as flat as a poorly executed soufflé. 

But. The Pièce de résistance was the to go box of small pastries we bought to take as a gift to our host that evening as a thank you for having us for dinner. I will let the photo speak for itself. 

Au Revoir, Amelie. You can't say we didn't try."}
{"text":"Best pastries in Charlotte .. The macaroons suck here .. Other than that the decor and every tart, cake, and even employee is great ! I like this place .. especially the 24 hour location in noda"}
{"text":"Not the same feel as the NODA one but a great fix for my beloved chai tea lattes. The inside decor seems so forced its almost cheesy. I know you can't do much in a mini mall space, but I feel like the character is lost. Isn't that half the reason we go to Amelie's? The baked goods are OK but honestly? My macaroon was lifeless, bland and way too cold. Hubs hazelnut tarte was also lacking in satisfaction. And then the girl at the register tells me a lot of their stuff comes in outsourced, frozen and packaged! NOOOOO!!! Sad days. 
And do note, this one is only open til 9! Suburbs Amelie's I'm glad you're here and all but it's just not the same!"}

{"text":"I like Amelie's. The food is great. The coffee is great. The atmosphere is great. 

That said, they need to get their sh!t together with the line. It's slower than a TSA security check. I just want a cup of coffee. Why do I need to stand in line for half an hour while the person behind the counter patiently explains all 300 f'ing macaron flavors to every individual in line in front of me? Oh, look! The cashier is just standing there, staring off into the distance, thinking about how much more rad the world would be if Kathleen Hanna were running for president while the infinitely patient person at the pastry counter runs through the macaron flavors AGAIN! 

Please, for the love of all that's good and decent, make a dedicated coffee line. And maybe make some little signs or something for the macarons? Amelie's is an awesome place and I'm glad they're killing it but often enough I find myself not going because I know it's gonna be a hassle. 

The macarons are great, by the way. When you hear them listed 200 times and find yourself spending the better part of an afternoon, slowly inching past them, more often than not you end up getting a couple. Gee, I wasn't hungry when I got in line. I just wanted coffee. How did I end up with these six macarons, a lemon tart and a f'ing miniature chocolate cake? I just wanted coffee! I JUST WANTED COFFEE!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Amelie's for awhile now. I can't say much for anything on the menu expect their coffee (dark roast) and the almond twice baked croissant, simply for the fact that I've never strayed from these. I'd say the only negative thing is there always seems to be a lengthy line, but that is more a reflection of quality and my lack of patience. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just had a wasabi macaron - it was amazing!!! Don't skip over it if you like wasabi, it was super special and I can't want to go back for another one!"}
{"text":"Why are you wasting time reading these reviews? Just come already and order whatever catches your eye...it will be amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite amelies location. Its large, so you can fit your whole party, and there is never really a long line. All of their baked goods are good, their soups are amazing, and their french sodas are to die for. I would personally recommend the basil lime macroon, which is only seasonal. The staff is nice and when they mess up an order they leave it with you (if you want it of course) which is good when your paying quite a high price for it. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Really love this place, and especially love that it's open all the time. Amazing croissants and reasonably good coffee. I usually just pop in to pick up pastries for my fam on Saturday mornings, but I could totally imagine enjoying a great, long, late lunch.

The decor is kitschy in a way that for me is not charming (which is what was probably  intended), but instead makes it seem less elevated than it is. That's superficial, though, and the edibles speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"Open 24/7, wonderful place to relax and fill your tummy with delicious menu items and excellent coffee. Everything they serve is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good for a coffee date, studying  or showing off a place to friends & family from out of town... Just prepare yourself for a line no matter the time."}
{"text":"What a cool French (and delicious) bakery! I give Amelie's a full five stars without hesitation. This is the first Charlotte restaurant (as a new resident!) I can say has lived up to its hype. The salted caramel brownie was phenomenal (a nice rich brownie base with a yummy caramel-like icing with a slight crunch which I'm assuming was the hint of salt); the salted caramel brownie was not overly salted, which can sometimes happen with salted desserts. The napoleon is another good choice and featured a rich vanilla frosting and creamy layering with puffed pasty... yummy! The two best sandwiches, in my opinion, were the chicken salad sandwich and ham/cheese/manchego croissant sandwich. The salted brownie caramel brownie latte was to die for (cannot imagine the calories count). One thing to note if you're a latte/cappuccino person is that there are only full fat and almond milk options available (ie no skim, 2%, etc.). Also, the macarons are offered in a multiple of flavors but are a little price and $2 and some change."}
{"text":"I like the concept of Amelie's a lot... However, I don't know if being one of the few boutique bakeries is attractive enough to me to spend a small fortune on a couple of pastries or a very small breakfast sandwich. 

I am a born and bred New Yorker, but even I am uncomfortable making Amelie's a regular spot at those prices. 

Don't let that discourage you, the pastries have never disappointed in taste, texture, or consistency. (With the added bonus of being open 24 hours.)"}
{"text":"The Pistachio macarons are amazing!  The atmosphere and the people are very welcoming. I love stopping by every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love Amelies but this is definitely my favorite location. Sometimes their other locations have let me down (stale macarons are no good!)  but this spot has always been great! The staff is friendly and the pastries are always consistent. Love the vibe of this place and will visit overtime I am in this area!"}
{"text":"I tried the raspberry cake and the cream cheese puffs. I was very underwhelmed. The cake lacked flavor and was very bland. The cheese puffs while ok were not like \"omg I have to have!\" I actually drove quite a ways to get to this place because I read that it was open 24hrs. Maybe the desserts taste better when you are drunk or you are a college student who typically lives off ramen. This seemed to be the type of crowd attracted to the place. It is a very eclectic-urban type place. Very artsy. While that does not bother me, I did not like how the location is right next to a club. Not at all a place that I will come back to. Le Madeleine is 100 times better sadly."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out from the great reviews I had heard from friends. Long lines, no where to sit, overpriced pastries, and service wasn't that great.."}
{"text":"Snooty, cool kids place, frozen pastries, not paying minimum wage: Sound like Paris to you?"}
{"text":"Amelies is a great place, however, until the uptown location can contol their issue with the street walkers approaching dining customers for cash, I'll choose another location.  I have been aporoached on 3 different occasions by someone asking for money while dining at the uptown location.  I had out of town family with me on one occasion and the management staff on duty at the time had zero concern for the issue."}
{"text":"Very clean and of course the decor was beautiful and traditional for Amelie's. On the other hand, the line which was about seven people long took about fifteen minutes to get through which would have been acceptable if only one person was helping customers. However, there were five people \"helping\". Not one of them smiled, said hello, or even acknowledged me until I asked to order. She then said \"what do you want?\" So I asked when the cream puffs were made because they were clearly a day or two old and she proceeded to tell me they were made a couple hours ago. It also had a finger print in it. No thank you! A lot of the pastries were also mislabeled and there was not much left for being four hours from closing. I ordered a chocolate peanut butter petit four and had asked what was in it and she told me \"chocolate and peanut butter\". Oh thanks that clears things up! I was then ring up by the manager, who barely looked up from his screen except to ask for my money handed me a receipt and that was it... WORST customer service I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Cutest little bakery I've ever seen!! Everyone was so friendly too! The only thing is that outside seating is a little bit limited so we weren't able to really see the city when we were inside. Other than that I loved it and the pastries were amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. We had a sandwich and something to drink. The food was delicious. Our bartender Ryan was great. It was a great lunch"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this is better than most places in Charlotte in terms of bakeries/cafes for atmosphere, but the food and pastries are good at best.  The Croque Monsier was greasy and smelled like it was burnt in a toaster oven.  The apple tart crust was so tough that I could barely cut it, and the French macaroon was as hard as a rock. I could do a better job with an Easy Bake Oven.  The staff here isn't much better.  Everyone treats you as though they're doing them you a favor.  It's a cool place in terms of the decor, but the food and staff are truly lacking.  The search continues......"}
{"text":"Great place for a soup and sandwich lunch.  Or a beer and sandwich dinner, since it's open til 11 (yay).  It has a bar for your convenience, but the best are all the separated tables and alcoves.  Oh, and their croissants are SO flaky, om nom nom. The soup was decent as well.  So if you need a place to work on your laptop while you have lunch, or you're having a quiet get together, this is a darn good spot."}
{"text":"Salted Caramel Macaroon was amazing, but waaaay overpriced! I paid $12 bucks for 2 macaroons, a cup of tea, and a mini chocolate cake bar!! I can buy a whole cake for that price!"}
{"text":"Love the new location in uptown! Although having all those delicious pastries within walking distance might be dangerous."}
{"text":"After wondering in NoDa area, which is really smaller than expected, I walked in this famous restaurant, and had a piece of creamy cheese croissant and queshi, they are so yummy. The Croissant with sweet and sour taste creamy cheese is a fresh appetizer. The Queshi, my first time to try is crispy outside and soft inside."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Always come by! but be warmed they are super busy and very long lines on weekends and around midnight! lol"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. The pastries are amazing and the customer service was stellar!
Dropped in to check out the new location and was greeted immediately. I've frequented other locations over the years but this is my new spot! Courtney and Gantt were a pleasure to meet and very helpful. The entire staff was eager to make this visit an experience to remember.  Thanks Amelies :)"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery. I gave gift cards to Amelie's to my employees, many are from europe and decry the quality of desserts in America. They LOVED Amelie's. Said it was like a taste of home."}
{"text":"Staff was hanging out drinking at 9pm and told me they were closed when they were supposed to be open till midnight. Wasted a trip and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The biggest disappointment with this place is that I went all four days that I was in Charlotte (only bought something two of those days) because I saw all the pictures posted on yelp of their napoleons but they did not have it on any of the days that I went!  I was told that they had sold out and that you need to get there early in the morning (was going around 4pm the first three days due to training sessions I was attending) so on the last day I was there, I went during breakfast.  Ended up having the croissant with eggs, sausage and spinach.  Tasty but you can't really do anything different than anyone else making a breakfast sandwich.  I did have their special coffee of the month, which was really good.  I wish I could remember what the cashier called it - something like toasted almond caramel latte.  The first day, I tried their salted caramel layer torte (third from right on the third rack down in the picture).  It was ok, kind of dry but I'm not sure if it was because I ate it there so it came directly from their case.  Maybe it needed to sit a bit so it could reach room temp?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday expecting to have a decent breakfast. Twice baked croissant was soggy and texture was not right. Espresso drinks were not hot and there was a bunch of sweet syrupy stuff in the bottom of the cup that left a bad aftertaste in the mouth and throat. Waitress couldn't find our table since we sat outside and food never came. I expected more from the uptown Amelie's. I've been to all there locations and enjoyed the noda spot the most, however I think it's time to stop frequenting this chain. Still liking mama's in pineville for good coffee and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Love all the comfy furniture, but it is often crowded and hard to find two seats together. Coffee is good. Pastries are OK. Greatest asset is safe, all-night access. Not many places in Charlotte welcome customers after midnight."}
{"text":"Coffee was spectacular and I loved their selection of pasties and cakes. I ended up with the strawberry-cheese  danish and it was very good. Cute place!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most unique places I've ever been to. I was walking through the city of Charlotte and I friend recommended me this place. Has to be my favorite spot to have coffee thus far. The art work is so creative and beautiful. I took pictures nonstop. The coffee was amazing. You have to definitely try this spot."}
{"text":"Who cannot love Amelie's? Walk in to one of the most relaxing spaces in Charlotte and you will find yourself among a sea of folks just like me. Any time of day, or night, Amelie's has a showcase of mouth watering pastries, savory soups and sandwiches, salads, pastries, artisan breads, pastries and an array of teas and coffees. Did I mention the pastries? Grab your laptop, bring a friend, grab a snack and walk back into any one of the eclectically decorated rooms. Stay as long as you like; Amelie's is open 24/7."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last weekend.  I had the dark chocolate, cherry bread pudding.  It was amazing.  The atmosphere is great too."}
{"text":"Seriously, can I just move in and stay forever?! I LOVE Amelie's. The decor is amazing and the entire layout of the bakery is like a giant maze of cozy little nooks and crannies. And to top it off their pastries are incredible. Swear to god I could live off the salted caramel brownie."}
{"text":"great spot for lunch!! I love their style and super cozy atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place comes highly recommended from everyone I asked when I visited Charlotte. I have to say that the hype was a real letdown when I got there.

It seems that this place sees a lot of business, as evidenced by the line to be served, and the full seating area (which is ample, to be fair). I tried a croissant and a danish. The croissant was dense and did not appear to take to the filling very well.  It looked deflated and sad.  It tasted wonderful, though, save for the dense chewy texture. I had to check the menu on the way out to confirm that it wasn't one of the twice-baked croissants. The danish was good!

I ordered a café au lait, which is my standard go-to beverage when I'm not feeling like I need a full-powered drink. Granted, this place is not a specialized coffeehouse, but it does offer lattes and the like.  My drink came barely hot with about two inches of foam. The coffee flavor was nothing special. If it were my first of the morning, 

It was okay, but I will probably go somewhere else for coffee. I would like to return to try a cake sometime on a future visit to Charlotte.

This review is mainly for my experience there, which didn't include sampling a lot of the French pastries which were available. I may want to revise my review once I try more."}
{"text":"The only reason I would come here would be to show a friend a super weird coffee shop. It's perfect for people watching. And analyzing the walls, lamps, furniture. It's a smart cafe. They draw in people through the decor. The desserts are good. I'm glad the salted caramel brownie is small, I couldn't even finish it. I would like to rave about the mini blueberry tart. It's perfect. Flawless. I'm big on fruit tarts I guess. I would definitely come back- more for hanging out than anything- and for a mini fruit tart. I like that they let you have a refill of coffee or hot water for tea. Fun place overall."}
{"text":"I'm so happy a friend told me about this place. The ambience is great, the service is amazing and the drinks and sweets they have are to die for! I will definitely be utilizing their location that is open 24/7! :)"}
{"text":"Love their coffee and the desserts. I would definitely recommend salted caramel, pecan tart and the Napoleon! My friend liked the macaroons too- they have varied flavors. And the best thing they are open late."}
{"text":"Amelie's is very eclectic in decor. Customers order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table. I wouldn't suggest it for large groups. It is a fun place to bring guests from out of town. 
I ordered a sandwich and it was very good and what I expected. The baked goods in the glass display case looked fantastic. I regret that I didn't get a Napoleon.  Amelie's may seem a little pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"C'mon; where else can you get AMAZING pastries (and I mean amazing) 24 hours a day?! In the mood for something to eat/drink, I highly recommend this one. Great place to sit down, sip some coffee and have a bite. You would think it was 5:30 in the afternoon at 3am here. The locals love it, and it's a great place to relax at any hour. The decor is a very eclectic collection of conversation-inspiring knick knacks. A must do in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"The asparagus and cheese quiche was chewy, dry and overcooked . It had no flavor. It was awful.  I could have done better buying one from a grocery store."}
{"text":"Why do I always do this to myself? Okay, I'll admit it. I had high hopes for Amelie's. After viewing their website and reading the rave reviews, I expected something...else. Maybe my hopes were too high, but I was ready to die in chocolate heaven, float on my blissful boat of yumminess and celebrate another year of being alive. Alas, it was not to be. 
My $50 chocolate chocolate birthday cake was anything but heavenly, and not at all blissful. In fact, I'm pretty sure that Harris Teeter makes a better chocolate cake. 
That being said, however, I still have hope for Amelie's, and won't dismiss it until I've tried some of their other sugary confections."}
{"text":"Went to the one in NODA with my girl. Wonderful experience. Atmosphere & food were delightful"}
{"text":"Pastries looked amazing but I had a large, delicious breakfast sandwich --- egg, ham, spinach, & brie on baguette (for $10 it better be great). Coffee was just ok and I have no idea if refills are available because no one offered. Left a 20% tip on my tab but not sure why. Staff seemed indifferent and not terribly service oriented. Large, busy kitchen but I didn't see anyone checking on tables on the floor other than to deliver food with a grunt. Men's room was an embarrassment. Old fixtures, odor, certainly not a French \"toilette.\" Overall I wasn't impressed with the eat-in experience. Maybe this is a takeout-only destination."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! Amelie has 3 locations in Charlotte but this is the only one that's open 24/7. 

Here's several highlights about this bakery: 

The salted caramel brownies are delicious! This is one of their best sellers... and I'd say that it lives up to the hype. I had the rose eclair on my last visit and while it was good, it didn't beat the brownies. 

I've been to this location multiple times and there's always a line to place an order. My last visit was on a Saturday around 8:30PM. There were probably about 15 people ahead of me. So if you're looking for a grab and go experience, this is not the place. 

The ambiance is very whimsical and cute. I love it! They have plenty of seating. Lots of people seem to come here to work. I've never done it so can't testify to the quality of their wifi or number of power outlets... however judging by the crowd, I can safely assume they do pretty good job on both."}
{"text":"You know it's an amazing day when you can have salted caramel brownies for breakfast and pre-dinner meal... Yup! That's what I did today! 

Was in the area for a meeting and decided to stop by at this place. I've been to the other location in NoDa, but have never been here. I expected it to be much smaller just because I know it's in the downtown area. So was very surprised to see the huge space and the same cute decor as the other location. 

Got the brownies and salted caramel hot mocha to kick start my morning... Both were delicious!!! Decided to come back later that afternoon and brought my colleagues with me. All testified to the deliciousness of the brownies. So when they said they have sold over 100,000 brownies, they were not joking, people! 

We also got several cakes. I think they were the vanilla strawberry cake and the berry cake. Not sure what the official name of the second one was. I thought they were just OK. The cream tasted a bit too buttery for me and there wasn't enough sweet/tarty taste that I expected from strawberry/berry cakes. 

Loveeee the whimsical, cute decor. If I live in Charlotte, I would definitely make this my go-to bakery!"}
{"text":"I've been to Amelie's a few times at their new location at 2424 N Davidson St & love the charm of the business.  Big fan of their cookies & eclairs.  THE SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIES ARE THE TRUTH!"}
{"text":"Great salted caramel brownies."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location a two star because the few times I've been there (morning, night, late night, afternoon) I've always gotten mediocre drinks/food. If you've been to the NODA location you expect pricey baked goods and tiny cups of coffee for the same price as a normal human-sized cups of coffee; you expect that. What you don't expect is burned- tasting coffee, hard macaroons, and food that barely deserves the name. I know they have trained staff properly but it sure does not show up in the product. 

The staff are normal Amelie's staff; the cashiers are bored, baristas are harried/ rude, bakery counter is goofing around but they're not the issue here. The issue is that every single time I've gone in, the TIMES OF OPERATION are totally different. Whether it's because they've just opened or it's the weekend or some other reason, it's never the same. Continuity, folks, continuity. That's all I want. 

The space is great, love the decor especially the light fixtures, and I think they did a wonderful job transforming the space."}
{"text":"Great place, only place to go if you just fancy some deserts,, a place to go at the end of an evening."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving Dinner here... on purpose.  We were passing through and thought it would be nice to have something different and local.  I like the food. Not bad at all.  The desserts were really great and we had lots of choices.  The prices were high. But it is a locally owned spot and I am more willing to pay slightly higher to support local business.  I felt rushed when placing my order. I had no idea what i wanted and needed time to check it out.  I didnt even see the vegetarian option they had which is what i would have totally preferred.  I will go back if ever in Charlotte again. I know what to get now."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go to the famed Amelie's (in NoDa) today with a few friends. When we first pulled up, I noticed that the parking lot was absolutely PACKED, which usually says good things. The decor of Amelie's is quite eclectic, just as the customers are. It marks itself as a French bakery and the art decorating the walls follows that theme. Honestly, it's a gorgeous place. It has a surprisingly large interior with different rooms that are all equipped with extensive seating and tables, as well as two free wi-fi networks. A lot of people were hanging around doing work on MacBooks and eating baked goods. All in all, it appears to be a really funky, awesome place to hang out if you can find a seat.

For the food, I tried the vanilla Creme Brulee ($4.99) and purchased the \"award-winning\" Salted Caramel Brownie ($1.79) for later. First of all, I was amazed at the speed of the guy working the counter/register when there was literally 15 people in line being quite loud. Secondly, the Creme Brulee wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. Something about the taste of it wasn't what I was used to. Regardless, it was still pretty decent. I've yet to try to the brownie, but according to the people beside me in line, it is one of the best things available at Amelie's and well worth the two bucks. My friends both tried different large chocolate creations that tasted about the same, but were both quite delicious (this coming from somebody who isn't a chocolate fan). 

The prices at Amelie's are pretty high, but the environment is worth it. My friends and I all enjoyed what we ordered and agreed it was worth the price. Thanks Amelie's for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The quality has fallin to the way side.   No more real butter cream, BUT  Grease Cream they buy in 5 gallon buckets ! !      Frozen   desserts defrosted,  STALE Brownies    

this place has seen its hay day its over with Amelies,"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Pastries are incredible, coffee is great as well!  Truly a unique spot on Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to a real european bakery. The coffee is ok but the tarts and other treats are really fantastic. I have not had anything that was disappointing yet so just go for what looks good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Right in the heart of uptown. Delicious pastries, sandwiches and drinks. There are tons of places to sit and hangout. It's decorated to the nines, gives such a cool vibe. You must go if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"When I first read about Amelie's and that it was a 24-hour French bakery, I was sold. After my bf and I tried some beers at NoDa and Birdsong, we decided to pick up some dessert since it was down the street and were surprised to find a huge crowd inside at 11 PM. 

The line was wrapped around the corner all the way back to the bathroom. My boyfriend and I were thoroughly confused and asked a group if this was the line, to which they answered yes and that they had been waiting for 40 minutes...and then even more bewildering, they offered us their place in line and left (they waited that long to get so close, only to leave?!?!).

Because of this act of kindness, we were able to order our salted caramel brownie, a chocolate-covered cream puff, and some sort of strawberry cream cake within ten minutes. 

Side note: For a \"French\" bakery, everything was pretty sweet. Something I've noticed about French desserts is that they aren't sugary sweet, but Amelie's seems more of a French-inspired bakery than anything, considering their bestseller is a salted caramel brownie which does not seem very French. 

Onto the actual desserts:

The popular salted caramel brownie: for $2-something, you get a dainty brownie with a thick layer of caramel on top. I loved that the brownie had a crunchy top, but it was too sweet, and I couldn't really taste the salted part. It was good, but I don't get all the rave reviews about it.

Cream puff: overall, what you would expect from a cream puff. Good pastry. I didn't like the cream inside as much. It was a little thick, and I was expecting something fluffier and light. 

Strawberry cake thing (don't remember the proper name): it was one of the small cakes with a crunchy nut coating on the outside and a white fluffy icing and yellow cake. I really liked the crunchy coating on the cake. It was probably my favorite part, but again, it was really sweet and I think there was supposed to be a little strawberry filling inside but barely got any and I really wanted more to balance out that sugary sweetness of everything else. 

Summary: Had I waited an hour for them, I would've been annoyed. It was a little too sweet for me, a tad pricey for what it is, but overall, I enjoyed my desserts with some tea."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with this location and after reading the other reviews I can see I'm not the only one. The quality of the pastries just isn't like what you find at the NoDa location but they're still good. 

My main concern is the staff. They are disinterested to the point of rudeness. I'm not the sort to expect servers to fall all over themselves at my expense so when I say they're bad, they are definitely bad. Please Amelie's, hire people who don't treat your customers like an inconvenience. I know you know this is a problem, I've seen your responses to other reviews."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great atmosphere, Excellent pastries!"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place to unwind after a long day. Enjoyed a exquisite dessert with a hot cup of coffee while the soothing music and light chatter of people fill the room. Most highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is cute but a bit prententious. Overpriced hipster level attitude and quality is not my cup of tea. I was visiting the area and had not been here and spent $25 on just a quick lunch, a coffee a d a few macaroons. They weren't the best I have had and for the cost were disappointing. The atmosphere is quirky which I thought was nice but then realized it is more to be cool then unique."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick breakfast or a sweet treat with friends.This location is huge, so there are plenty of little nooks and crannies to sit if just by yourself or with a large group of people. However, this is not the place to go if you're expecting a big brunch-type meal. 

The entrance and ordering line was a bit confusing on a Sunday morning around 11:30, but our ordering was quick and easy. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant, which needed to be prepared. We took up a large table for our party of 7. After sitting down, those of us that ordered sandwiches waited approximately 10 minutes before they were brought to us by one of the staff. I appreciate that they take the time to find and serve their customers, as opposed to having to go back up to the front to obtain your food. I saw one guy studying in a corner with some coffee, which made me realize that Amelie's is a much better alternative to Starbucks, if you're going for the coffee house vibe.

The breakfast sandwich (egg, sausage, cheese, spinach, on a croissant) was good, but nothing spectacular. I sampled a few of my friends' pastries which were tasty. I will go back, but only for a pasty or dessert."}
{"text":"What a great lunch in an eclectic place - the roast beef manchego on croissant - awesome! Rachel was a friendly and efficient server - this place is amazing! Wish I lived near here- it made my Visit perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and am sad to say that I have left unhappy each time.Why do I keep going back you ask? Perhaps I'm a glutton for punishment, or the allure of it being 10 minutes from my house is tempting compared to the 40 minute trip to Noda. Either way I have decided not to return. My first encounter was the grand opening, it was decent enough to try again. The next time it was my birthday and I placed an order for a cake two weeks in advance....when I go in to pick it up they don't have it. They were not apologetic in the least nor did they offer to fix their mistake. Simply unorganized and unprofessional. The next time I got coconut macaroons and a salted Caramel blabla coffee. Waited 15min for it yet it still tasted like straight ocean water. It's not supposed to taste like burnt salty tap water. Went again tonight, the case was practically empty, staff was rude, the dining area was filthy. Staff performing closing duties and mopping at 7:40! Not even going to touch on the lack of quality of the pastries purchased. Coffee was trash once again. The store is staffed with angst filled teenagers who are too cool to be there. Have heard employees talking smack about management/bakery staff every time I've been here. I am truly confused as to how poorly this location is being run. And frankly appalled. They need to do better. 0/10 wouldn't recommend. It's a no from from me."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the lavender lemonade! It's totally worth the 45 minute drive for me. Add in some carmel salted brownies, macaroons, and the chocolate croissants and you're good to go! I have such a big sweet tooth so this place is my go-to for treats. 
The line can get really long and finding a place to sit is a challenge sometimes, but the atmosphere is so casual and cool. There's always something new to look at!"}
{"text":"Love this place. When I'm working uptown, I'm here at least twice a day. They never fail to disappoint. the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Last night was the first and last time I will ever eat at Amelie's. To start off, the staff were rude and very unfriendly. I ordered a cream puff that was nearly five dollars and have been throwing up all night due to food poisoning. If you ever visit this bakery, I highly suggest ordering an item that doesn't contain cream. Harris Teeter sells equal if not better deserts than Amelie's and I am sure they do not feed their customers spoiled food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with stellar food, great atmosphere and study or gather with friends this place meets all your needs. I cannot get enough time at Amelie's, especially with needing to study late night or sit, sip, and read. In my opinion Amelie's is institution worthy. Although, my wife may start complaining I stop by too often and pick up dessert, even though; she does not complain in the moment.  I do not know who makes the pastries and desserts there, but they have eclectic style of simplistic originality that excites the mouth."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, every time was an exceptional experience! All of the items I purchased were amazing. Although they stay packed (I have been day and night) as long as you have a little patience it pays off ;)!"}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for the first time and she really enjoyed it.  Every time I come, there is always a line ... this place is wildly popular!  I love the decor in the sitting room and the cozy,  quaint feel of this place not to mention the varieties of sweet goodness.  The only drawback can be parking and finding a place to sit.

I recommend the salted caramel torte and the salted caramel brownie.  Can you say delicious?!!  Those were both of our favorites.  It is definitely a place to visit if you've never been there.  They are open 24/7!"}
{"text":"As a European Expat living in Charlotte, I can tell you this isn't a French bakery, not even close!!! It is Southern standards which mean it is sweet sweet sweet and nothing else! Bleugh!

Don't waste your time or money on eating nothing but sugar.... Dumpy atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Holy adorable!  I was in town visiting and my friend recommended we check out this cute French bakery. I had no idea what i was in for. This place has tons of little eclectic cafe tables scattered throughout along with some couches in a separate sitting area for a very relaxing and cute relaxing area. Oh yeah, and there are pastries too. I got an eclair to go but didn't make it out the door before deciding there was too much to soak up inside this cute bakery. I had to sit down at one of the tables and at least sample my goods. Very tasty!  I recommend grabbing a latte and an eclair and soaking in the relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with extremely horrible service. The staff was not only rude to the customers, but were fighting with each other. The guy who took our order had a chip on his shoulder and treated us as if we were annoying him. He didn't listen to my order and when I told him he messed up, he told me that he already placed my food in the oven...kinda a \"oh-well\" to it. The baked goods were not good enough for me to come back and deal with all of the negativity that was in that place tonight. I'm sorry Amelie's but you have lost yet another paying customer."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Amelies?  Well my mom for one, because she doesn't like the industrial feel, but I love the place and it's a great place to bring out-of-towners"}
{"text":"Love working here(: The staff is great and the customers are too. If you've never been to an Amelie's I'd recommend trying the vast assortment of macarons."}
{"text":"I wish they had these in every town like McDonalds is. Amelies is the bees knees, I get a Napoleon every time I come in. And its filled with French items such as paintings and other art work. I never eat in because they're always busy and it gets really noisy. Staff has always treated me well and very knowledgeable about their products. Recommend to anyone who hasn't had it!"}
{"text":"Go to meet friends and play Mahjong.     I usually get a 1/2 sandwich and soup of the day. 

Not a fan of sweets, but they have plenty to choose from.    Its such an electic place, who wouldn't like going there.     Wish they had one in North Charlotte."}
{"text":"I don't know, y'all... Amelie's sort of weirds me out.

I've not ordered anything but pastries and tea, all of which have been decent but not earth-shattering... at least, nothing you can't get at any self respecting bakery styling itself \"French.\"  One of these days, I'll try a sandwich and/or soup, but I find myself so off-put by the atmo that I generally avoid going, even when I'm craving a \"French\" pastry.

It's just so... cavernous.  And the decor is a little fussy for my taste.  And it feels like a warehouse that someone's grandmother's house has thrown up on.  All of this to say that I don't feel particularly relaxed or comfortable when I go to Amelie's, and though I've brought a book or a magazine or some writing, all I really want to do is finish my croissant and split.

I think the high ceilings and general lack of space dividers make me feel very exposed.  Sort of the same reason I don't like Best Buy."}
{"text":"Paris in Charlotte! Try the tartines, and the croissants, and the fruit tarts and...stop reading and just go!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best places in Uptown Charlotte to get a cup of coffee, have an informal business lunch, or stop in late night for one more cocktail before you take the Blue Line back home ;)"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I found it a 5 star experience. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was inviting. Now it has gone downhill. The staff seems less than enthusiastic to serve their customers, it's quite disappointing. I still love the pastries and baguettes, but their soups and sandwiches are sub-par and very small for the price. What once was a very fun and inviting place has declined into just being a kitschy tourist stop."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, good food and coffee.  This location is larger than the NoDa location."}
{"text":"Menu on website says they have cold brew, but it's just regular iced coffee - misleading."}
{"text":"Their pastries and various desserts aren't too bad, but there are some other places that are much better.  Their coffees, however, have always been fantastic.  Tip of the hat to the various baristas!"}
{"text":"After being there 3 or 4 times, I don't quite get the hype. There is always an extremely long line for something I would deem just OK. The line does move pretty quickly for those who are willing to wait.  I've only had their sweets and pasties but I'm willing to give their coffee, sandwiches, and other menu items a try. I live close in the neighborhood so having another option for a quick lunch would be great. I'll definitely be back because I don't want to give up on this cute joint!"}
{"text":"Great place for a coffee and dessert after going out in Noda. I have never been for a full meal, but the menu looks really good."}
{"text":"Was at a party where they had gotten the gluten free almond cake with pistachio filling and chocolate frosting and it was unbelievably moist and delicious"}
{"text":"My wife and I always go to Amelie's for date night. Raspberry tarts and Petit's are great. But you can't beat the salted caramel brownie."}
{"text":"Walked in and asked for a doppio.  Response was 'Dope-what' and walked out."}
{"text":"This place is. It. Best atmosphere you could ask for, best food you could ask for, and the staff is amazing too. Close to the city, and it's open 24/7. I mean come on. 

Their prices are kinda high, but you definitely get your moneys worth in my opinion. 
Parking can also be an issue, as their parking lot isn't huge and it's shared with multiple businesses. So in the evenings and ESP. on the weekends you'll probably have to circle the lot a few times. 
Always a cool crowd, and the seating is super casual. You can come here for dinner, desert after a night out, or to study homework. The dress-code is nonexistant. You'll be sitting across for someone in sweats, and next to someone in a suit."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food.  Only been to the uptown location.  Line/waiting area could be improved - so 4 out of 5 starts but overall a great place worth visiting."}
{"text":"I love the food.  The atmosphere and business model is unique in every way and a BADLY needed addition to CLT culture. The spinach artichoke leek soup is the very best soup I have ever tasted and I'm usually twice the age of the average patron...every pastry and sandwich I have had has been great, truly. What holds my rating back is the service, it's consistently off, my order is consistently wrong and the last straw was last weekend I waited 30 min for a sandwich. I like Amelie's a lot but not that much. They cannot handle the crowds with the current staff. That might fly in Paris but here in the good ole US when I'm dropping $45 on lunch and snacks they need to step it up."}
{"text":"There are only so few moments 
where the brilliance and beauty of the otherwise 
common dreary 
shines through into an instance 
where I'd no sooner find myself weeping subtly -
tears of joy, and adoration -
In my heart that's where I find in you.

I find that within myself here, I can 
construct and hold a place
where one can bask in a glory 
and regularly appreciate with a contented kind of praise -
this homeland, 
where there I feel free,
to enjoy the sweets I'm so regularly deprived 
and yet still so look forward
with desperate desire.

Thanks Amélie's, 
for your graceful name even can caress the tongue before the sweet

after each visit I feel rejuvenated, 
renewed,
ready,
revived,
and above all else
inward yet expressly
I find myself
revitalized -

Seriously though, get one their tarts or macaroons. 
lol, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amelie's has the best pastries in Charlotte.  It is always on my itinerary when I have to be in the uptown area!  My husband will drive from Matthews for their eclairs and I will for the Salted Caramel brownie!!  What's more is that is doesn't matter when I need an Amelie's fix, because they are open 24x7 and every day of the year, including Christmas!!!  And the owners are lovely people who actually care about the community!"}
{"text":"The seeded roast beef sandwich is great. The salted caramel brownies are a revelation! The catered the desserts for our wedding! The wait is the only downside."}
{"text":"The baked products were OK, not great. Would be nice have more vegan options. The deli ham on the sandwich was cold, as was the spinach, and the cheese was not even melted... The long lines for a coffee is unacceptable. Staff was not the friendliest but still worth the visit."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place - the decor, the coffee, the pastries etc..Its my favorite spot for dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"Little surprised to see such a big bakery and coffee house within the city. We had some tough time in choosing the items from their vast collection. We finally tried half a dozen pastries and all of them were very yummy and delicious. Don't know where they source their coffee from, but it was very fresh and flavorful. Their cafe au lait is definitely one of the best I have tried. I wish we could have spent some more time to hangout there."}
{"text":"Awesome pastries, even gluten free ones. The interior is really cute, all French style and eclectic. I love coming here to study."}
{"text":"This place looks nice and is huge like a supermarket BUT
They only have almond milk, whole milk, or half and half
They only have one size coffee
\"It's the French style,\" is what the counterguy said.
Annoying like french people"}
{"text":"Deliciously exquisite croissants and coffee.  The service I received was superb, not sure why so many bad reviews on service...but I was 2nd to arrive.  The early bird gets the good service?

Can't wait to go back to try the other delicacies that were on display."}
{"text":"The very best of the local bakery's!  Absolutely love the Ambiance and spaciousness of this cafe.  The locks of love on the front fence make my day even brighter.  Wanna keep that special some1 forever, increase your chances by using this place any time of day."}
{"text":"Yum yum n yum!!! My only suggestion is that the use more filling in the macaroons, they were a bit disappointing when it came to flavor!"}
{"text":"This actually a review for the new Rock Hill location:

So good it will shut me up for a few minutes. Take my money (great prices!) Get in my mouth (delicious!)
Open all the time. I miss their live streaming webcam online but I think one can find it with google chrome. They do have a day in the life of their baker on fast track which is amazing to watch. 
They are growing for a reason.
Thanks for satisfying all of my cravings, salt and sweet at the same time. 
A cure for PMS, gents! Take your ladies here, or better yet, bring some  home."}
{"text":"Key lime tart. Nuff said! Be prepared to wait in line and pay a pretty penny. But so worth it"}
{"text":"I visited NoDa location last night and waited 20 minutes in line to get NOT FRESH, HARD AS ROCK MACAROONS.
What a shame, Amelie's.
I think it is very disrespectful to your clients to sell not fresh pasties. Very disappointing. 

Your ex-client, Anita"}
{"text":"Amelie's never disappoints. Even when there's a line around the corner, it really moves and the lattes and desserts are always tasty and delicious."}
{"text":"We had such a lovely time!  The staff was welcoming, space was comfortable and the desserts were delish!"}
{"text":"My goodness I love this place! It's eclectic and charming and brings a smile to my face every time I visit. 

I haven't been here when the place isn't buzzing, so be sure to go with a bit of time to spare because you may have to wait in a line that often wraps around the inside of the building. Nevertheless, the staff moves quickly and it's worth the short wait!

Amelie's pastries are adorably ornate and match the cute decor perfectly. Their famous salted caramel brownie lives up to the hype with a rich brownie layer, a crunchy sugar layer, and a soft caramel layer on top. Their Crème Brûlée is equally delicious, and their savory items like croissants and sandwiches are also quite a treat. 

With two locations in the Charlotte area, Amelie's is a must!"}
{"text":"Desserts! That is what you come for, that is what you return for, can't wait to try the new location in South Charlotte"}
{"text":"I loved the almond Tea cake - but other desserts ordered by my sister and husband were also very delicious. Open 24/7, we went their late night and still had to patiently be in a long queue!! But it was worth it! We will definitely visit this place again when we go to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Probably the best French bakery pastries in town! Their other food is excellent as well! Definitely recommend their lavender lemonade. Sometimes the line can be a bit long, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love love love the chicken salad!!! 
The bakery items are good but I wouldn't recommend any of the cakes! Most of them are made with buttercream and even though they look creamy, they are hard because the butter is solid...yuck! 
The coffee at Amelie's is nothing special so don't come here for coffee if you're picky! 
This location is closer to me that the NoDa one but I sometimes prefer to drive there because they seem  to have a few more bakery items than they do here. 
Other than that the service is mostly good."}
{"text":"A French Treat...try the Strawberry Cream Cheese bread pudding!!! To LIVE for...but not always available."}
{"text":"The turkey, bacon, cheese croissant was melting in my mouth when the awesome coffee tickled my taste buds."}
{"text":"What was I thinking????  I love everything about this place but the food I had.  So how in the world can I give it four stars?  First, I LOVE French Bakeries.  I have the best story about Alon's in Atlanta but that can wait for another day.

I drove this morning from Raleigh to Atlanta and realized quickly that Charlotte could be the location for a late breakfast.  Then I realized there was a French Bakery in Charlotte that was on one of Google's experimental sites that I visited this past weekend.  It was a 24 hour bakery that had a 360 degree camera going in the kitchen so you could watch the food being prepared any time you click the link.  The site is: http://www.chromeweblab.com/en-GB/teleporter .  

I got there at 10-ish and starved.  Instead of a getting a great pastry (and I have zero doubt that they make an astounding eclair, I got the breakfast sandwich with sausage and egg.  The croissant was amazing but the \"other stuff\" was just too overwhelming.  Like I said, I can't blame anyone but myself.  If I wanted breakfast, I should have stopped at an \"Awful Waffle\"

The deco is great.  It was full but not packed (10 am on Wed:) ).  The service was punctual, but not overly friendly.  No snide remarks about the French, please.

I am going to give this place another shot, for sure."}
{"text":"do your self a favor and try the carmel salted brownie... O...M...G...

It took me over an hour to chow down on the whole thing - overly sweet but will satisfy your sweet tooth if you have one. 

love the place, the seats, couches, tables its a funky place with a cool vibe... if i lived in the area i would be a regular...maybe... only maybe because the $$ will hit your pocket..."}
{"text":"100% delicious. You won't regret coming here. Food is wonderful with a lot of options to choose from, atmosphere is adorable, and the coffee is great as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed! I Usually go to the NoDa location (which I love) but decided to try this one since it's closer to where I live. The Desserts are not the same level of quality at this location. The macaron has a thick jelly in the middle instead of a \"filling\". It's so thick u can see it hanging out from the side of it. It totally over powers the taste of the entire macaron. Taste more like jelly filled cookies or a jelly roll than a macaron. The iced sticky bun was disappointing as well as it was burnt around the edges. As of matter of fact, All of them in the display were burnt. I still decided to try it tearing off the burnt edges of the bun. They definitely shouldn't have served them. The bun taste ok but drier than what I'm used to having at NoDa's location. The salted caramel brownie was good & same taste/quality as the other location. Overall, It's worth the drive to NoDa instead of this location next time..."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this bakery and having heard great things about it and seeing such a long line of people waiting for a dessert,  I was not at all impressed with the petit gateau I tried, the vanilla strawberry and the chocolate gateau were dry and stiff  and were not good.  I even went back the next day I was around the area because I could not believe that this place was not the best bakery after the long line of people I saw, I thought that maybe I was mistaken maybe I needed to try something else so I tried the fruit tart and it was average like the one at harris teeter nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Cutest place ever. I had the legendary salted caramel brownie which was amazing. Service was kinda slow but there was a lot of concerts that night and it was at 7 or 8 pm on a Saturday. The cashier made fun of my Avett brothers shirt but whatever haha... typical bakery prices and your average NoDa crowd. A must visit!"}
{"text":"YES! YES!! YES!!! This is one of my favorite late night sweet tooth places in Charlotte. And it is open 24/7. (NODA location) The decor is cute with lots of vintage looking things and cozy couches. Me and my friends always seem to go when there is a long line. If you are a patient person, the WAIT is WORTH IT!! It can get a little pricey just for desserts and sweets, but you just cannot pick just one dessert when you go here.

The favs thus far: Honey Bun, Eclairs, Pecan Pie Tarts, Salted Carmel Brownies, Croissants, Mini Tarts, Lemon Tea Cakes"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! The pastries are delicious and look so darn cute. I had the lemon raspberry tart and chocolate croissant, both were amazing! :) 

They are open 24 hours, at times I have found the tables a little more dirty than I would like, but I guess having perfect french pastries comes with a cost."}
{"text":"It was great!! Great food, pretty decor. I just moved to Charlotte and I'm very excited that this right around the corner! I will definitely go back. I told my mom when she comes out to visit this is the place we are going to go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff are super friendly, the atmosphere is crazy eclectic, and the food is even better! Great place to come a relax with some pastries and coffee and do some work or read a book. I recommend this place to all my friends and family, love it!"}
{"text":"Soooo happy this location is open close to my office. Driving to NoDa was just too dang far for me. But now I can have eclairs whenever I want! (Wait, maybe this is a BAD thing for my wallet and waistline.) The only negative is the ordering process, which seems a little dis\"order\"ly and confusing. I was waiting in line for the pastry case, but others wanted to order sandwiches and after waiting in the line, they were told they had to order prepared foods at the register. There should be better signage for the different ordering stations, rather than waiting in a ridiculously long line only to be told they could have skipped that and gone directly to the register."}
{"text":"What a let down- it is 24 hours but the Salted caramel brownie was the only star worthy item I tried.  No one in my party liked any of the pastries or tarts, they were bland and the texture was off.  In fact, one of them sat in our hotel room, one bite taken, never to be finished becasue we were so disappointed with the pastry quality...Not worth the calorie splurge"}
{"text":"Great food! Wanted a late night snack and found this 24 hr gem. Their selection is vast and their quality is superb. Even simple things like their balsamic dressing is out of this world and their baguette with jam is delicious. Great selection of teas and coffee, and cool speciality drinks in season. 

The prices are decent on the higher end but you get quality! It's not an ihop late night snack rather fresh dishes all night in a space with great vibes ! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods. Delicious caffeinated coffee beverages. Plenty of interesting seating environments. Check this place out any time of the day!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Amelie's.  The first thing I always go for is a big coffee and whatever tart is available.  The atmosphere is fantastic and very eclectic with a home-like feel. Friendly staff, and clean restaurant always makes for a nice treat! Pun intended!"}
{"text":"Went into Amelie's yesterday for a shot of espresso.  People behind the counter were friendly, but the shot of espresso was over-extracted *pulled too long*.  I used the wifi for a couple minutes and didn't finish the espresso as it was bitter and unpleasant.  

I went in today to give the espresso another chance as they weren't too far off from pulling a good shot and they had been friendly.  The same barista from the day before was working.  I politely asked the barista to pull the shot a little shorter as the one from yesterday was over-extracted and a pretty bitter.  Instead of hearing an oh okay, sure, or an okay, sorry about that.  I got a very condescending talk about how he probably used too much coffee, and that it wasn't over-extracted as it would have been sour.  

If it was only his incorrect explanation of why yesterday's shot tasted bad, I'd be going back to Amelie's again.  I love talking coffee/espresso extraction and would had started up a conversation about the subject.  

He did pull this shot shorter than yesterdays and it was a good extraction.  The flavor of the shot wasn't my preference, as it seemed to be a roast on the darker side of medium, but the bitterness or astringency wasn't there this time.  Since he took an arrogant and condescending tone with me, I won't be going back there again and am giving this establishment a 1 Star rating.  If that had not happened, I would had given a 3 and revisited the location, as correctly extracted espresso is in very short demand in Charlotte.  

If the barista happens to read this, here are some links so you can understand extraction correctly.

Might also want to spend some time reading up on how to take criticism, especially when it is constructive criticism."}
{"text":"Great experience and plenty of space here. This has been the perfect place for a gathering of meeting."}
{"text":"Great Spot, Really Swanky and Good Food. 
A Little cold on the inside, Bring a sweater"}
{"text":"Oui ou Non?  Ummm Non. Amelie's French Bakery is not quite \"une boulangerie française.\"  The pastries don't remind me of France or even Canada and I suspect it's because of the use of margarine as a substitute for real full fat butter.  There isn't much bread to purchase which usually is a staple at a French bakery and everything taste a bit frozen.  I feel like taking an international flight just to get a delicious pineapple coconut cream cheese ring or a simple freshly made baguette.

The Pros:
The staff are the nicest people ever.
The shop stays open 24 hours which is rare in Charlotte.
The food is visually appealing.

The Cons:
The eating area is filthy which makes me nervous about the kitchen.
Seating is limited.
The decor is a tacky mix of the idea of what Paris should look like mixed with the local thrift store.
Overpriced for quality."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Long line on the weekend though, I would get there early before some of the things sell out. Had the jambon et fromage... gruyere with ham. Was extremely awesome, the bread was perfect. I would be back, but this time to try all of the pastries."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a night place. Get a cake and a coffee and your good for the whole night. I saw many students studying over here at night. I love this place. Great ambience . Feels like home."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad thing here.  The ambiance is amazing, as are the pastries, teas and coffees. I haven't had much from the full menu, but the soups are all amazing.  I always stop by when I'm in NoDa!"}
{"text":"(see explanation of ratings below)

3 of 3 stars (excellent fast food).

One of those places you just gotta see when in Charlotte.

What to wear: a black beret.

What to take: your laptop or iPad.

Open 24 hours.

About $11 per person, gratuity not included.

Order at the counter and they deliver to your seat.  That plus the use of paper napkins and paper cups means they cannot get 5 stars (this is not fine dining).

Cute warehouse-like set-up.  Incredible selection of house-made pastries and other baked goods.

About my ratings:

Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.

Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):

1) fast food (no table service)

2) casual dining (table service)

3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)

Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."}
{"text":"I come here for the fruit tarts which are the best in my opinion. Cozy place to have tea and coffee with friends or after dinner date. Sometimes seating and parking can be hard to come by so be prepared to be patient during busy times. The soups and chicken salad is also delicious."}
{"text":"First of all the staff is extremely friendly!

However, you know I always give a place at least 2 chances before I judge.  And so far, for both locations and I've gone 3 times, still lacks ganache!  This place is simply a WANNABE FRENCH CAFE, NOR IS IT ATLANTA'S CAFE INTERMEZZO. 

I swear I've tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but again to my chagrin it continues to disappoint. 1.  It has too many damn rules to take an oder with white tablecloth prices. 2.  There is nothing exceptional about the pastries.  A matter of fact they're average at best. And lastly, I suggest try to be original. Your decor lacks intimacy, let alone the cheap bar stools from that appear to be from Marshals. I would suggest that you spend the money and put some carpet down to dampen the constant echoing, instead of insulting your customers with some cheap landlord allocated CAM buildout deal. Just saying.....

{"text":"The ambiance and decor of this restaurant give it the third star. However the food is so hit and miss. The black Forrest ham and Gruyere sandwich is to die for, and probably the only thing I'll order from them from now on. The croissants are soggy. All of them. Almond twice baked, plain, pan au chocolat. All terrible. Soggy, too sweet, and cakey. A croissant should be flakey! The macaroons are overpriced, napoleons can be soggy (depending on which Amelie's you're visiting). Coffee is hit or miss as well depending on the barista. Overall, amelies is a nice place to grab a tea and hook on to some free wifi. But, the food is mediocre, with a combination of a few stellar items and a more let-downs."}
{"text":"Love this bakery. I've been multiple times and have never been disappointed. I also used them for a friends baby shower I was throwing recently. They were very reasonably priced  and the macaroons come in so many delicious flavors and colors that made mom-to-be happy."}
{"text":"Everything is so well prepared.  Great atmosphere  -- nothing disappoints.  Well, maybe they need more seating because it's so popular :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try it based on the rave reviews I'd read. I thought \"hmmm, lets give it a try, I'm sure they have something low cal I'd like\"...WRONG! Not only is it NOT low cal, its so darn tasty and tempting I ate my entire half sandwich and salad and then had desert...our desert bill was almost double our meal cost so we took some home for the family. We LOVED it and I plan to take my mom and aunt when they come in a few weeks."}
{"text":"The variety of macaroon flavored they have is fantastic! They never disappoint. When I was in school in Charlotte my friends and I would go as often as our wallets would let us! Best French bakery I've been to. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"I've been to Amelie's a few times over the years. While the pastries are tasty they're also a bit pricey. I don't mind paying good money for GREAT pastry, but each time I try something I walk away feeling like it's \"just okay\" and could have found something just as good elsewhere for equal or less cost. The atmosphere is great and fun at both locations although I would say the NODA locale is a bit funkier and more group friendly. This is a great place to take a group a friends. Being that it's open 24 hours (NODA only) it is also a great place to get some work done, read, or recover from an evening of brewery hopping. 

In Summary:
+ Okay food
+ Great service
+ Awesome location!
- Pricey"}
{"text":"To die for! Always stop anytime in Charlotte.  Carmel brownies are the best! Take time to wait even if the line goes 3 rooms back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and my order is wrong frequently. Today's mistake, ordered a seasonal salad add goat cheese (it was on one of the other 3 seasonal salads) add chicken. Number gets called and the dressing it comes with is not available. No biggie. I get my order and get back to work to realize there was no goat cheese. I walk back and was told they were out of it-I got charged. The cashier was happy to remedy it but with only 30 mins for lunch, no thanks. Get back to finally sit down and I realize no pecans on the salad as advertised. 6 things were supposed to be on the salad 3 showed up. Not great. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding baked goods. Lovely coffee. Great atmosphere. I sat at the bar and a standout for me is how spotless the goings on are behind it. I am a clean freak and this really impressed me. They've managed to make an odd basement space, cozy too. Cheerful staff and nice overall vibe. So glad they are in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of quaint desserts, sandwiches, coffee, and tea. 

However, the novelty of the decor (french decor, lots of artistic decor) quickly wears after a few visits. 

The pastries are totally overpriced, the service is pretty bad, and this place often seems to be the high school and stoner hang out."}
{"text":"Best of the best.  Only complaint can be the parking and or the line when someone just can't decide.  But the staff is helpful, friendly and can move folks fast."}
{"text":"To get better French pastry you need to be in France."}
{"text":"On the expensive side, but oh so yummy! Great french press coffee, lots of beautifully displayed pastry choices, and fun atmosphere. Great place to go!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed a girls' night out, a family lunch with kids, and a daughter's birthday at Amelie's.  It's a great place to stop in for a pastry order to go--the chocolate croissants are the BEST!  There are some \"interesting\" characters that show up after 7pm, but it makes it better if you like to people watch.  Everything I've had from Amelie's has been fantastic.  I hope that it's a Charlotte staple for years to come!  
The ONLY complaint I would have is when you need seating for a group of 4 or more people, and one person on their laptop is using the table for 6.  But that's not Amelie's fault.................."}
{"text":"I love the environment and the all of the food options available.  It is pretty crowded most of the time and sometimes the line will be quite long but if you have the time I would definitely wait, so worth the time!  I love their dessert options especially their creme brulee.   Will always return for more and would suggest it to others!"}
{"text":"This place would be great because of the atmosphere alone - a great, electic spot with a wide range of seating options, from couches to bistro tables to longer tables that work for groups. The only downside is that it's crowded, so getting the \"right\" spot for you can be a little tricky. But once you add the amazing pastries, the atmosphere is almost a non-event. There aren't many places in Charlotte with this kind of selection. From dainty, low-guilt treats to huge pieces of cake, they have all the pastries you could ask for. The \"savory\" options are more limited and basic, but also very yummy if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Went around 9pm, service was great, parking was a bit of a chore, but was a great find as I got lost while driving and decided to stop to eat."}
{"text":"Best bakery and coffee shop in Charlotte. It's a pity that the uptown location closed."}
{"text":"What's not to love? It's a little taste of Paris, right in NoDa. The coffee, pastries, sandwiches, atmosphere and staff are all superlative. If you haven't been yet, get in your car NOW. You can thank me later. With a cream puff."}
{"text":"I actually have not eaten there in almost a year, but being  a \"sweet tooth\" to the point of addiction,if I had more $, I would frequent it more often!  That being said, I actually liked the ORIGINAL Amelies a little better.  After they changed hands and branched out-serving sandwiches,etc, it lost some of its \"French bakery\" appeal for me.  My daughter really loved the luncheon meals and ate there weekly.  I found those to be rather overpriced and mediocre in my humble opinion.  But I never had a dessert item that I didn't really enjoy, my favorite being something called Napolean, which is so large and rich, even a sugarholic will get filled eating one!  And  reading another review about raspberry cream puffs makes me want to venture over and see if they still make them.  That reviewer didn't like them, but since I love anything raspberry I want to try one!  All in all, I believe I would like Amelies better if they only sold pastry items and coffee, and let the luncheon meals to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Finally! A 24 hour joint in Charlotte! I was introduced to Amelie's by a friend of mine and I am thrilled she did. I go to Amelie's once a week to catch up with girlfriends over coffee and delicious (and fattening) pastries and desserts. I adore the fact that it is always open and the employees are incredibly nice and helpful. They carry a wide variety of desserts and fresh pastries. They also carry breads, sandwiches and soups. I brought home a baguette a few weeks ago and by morning, it was no where to be found! It is a really unique and fun place to go with friends. They are constantly busy so be prepared to stand in line but it is definitely worth the wait. A word of caution: even though everything is made in the bakery and around the clock, not everything is as fresh as you think it might be. The cakes are refrigerated to keep fresh and cool which can make it difficult to eat and not always very enjoyable. I would probably stay away from those unless you see it come out and you know it was made recently. I recommend the tarts and the tea cakes. They offer quite a few mini desserts so it's easy and cheap to try many things at once without feeling like a gluttoness pig who just lost all their money. Amelies is definitely worth the trip even if it's just to stop in for a cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"This is a truly amazing bakery. Located near NoDa, this place perfectly complements the area. Although there is generally a line, it is well worth the wait. The pastries are always fresh and out of this world. Try the lemon meringue tart with raspberries! The raspberries are fresh and complement the sweetness of the tart. And of course always get a macaroon. My favourite is the orange coloured one. Cost should not matter, for it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"The search for good bread continues but this might be Charlotte's top contender.  Excellent pastries and quiche.  Definitely worth a trip out to NODA."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Amelie's for years - Great food, tiny portions and a wee bit on the expensive side. Their hours and yummy coffees make up for it."}
{"text":"The best hang out spot in NODA and North East Charlotte. So authentic, and cute as a button. Good simple food, delicious pastries. Love the fact that its 24hrs/7days a week. The only reason why I did not give it a full 5 stars- Is because it gets crazy CROWDED. Sometimes there are no seats, and there are times where the internet server has so many users all at once, that you get a poor signal, and computer move slower then my Grand Ma Nancy (Bless her soul). But then again, All good things are worth waiting for! So Amelie's is doing something right to attracted such a big crowds. *Two hands in the air and a butt pop for Amelies*"}
{"text":"Great little place, cute decor. Definitely worth trying for a date or desert. I would like it more if they offered decaf latte, but they only have decaf drip coffee. Otherwise the food is great,and the place is really cute. I will add the line is always long, be forewarned..."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been living in the Queen City for eight years, and I haven't said anything about the best bakery in town yet? For shame!

Alright, kids, if you haven't made your way to the sketchy part of NoDa yet to sample some of the best French pastries this side of Paris, then whatcha waitin' for? You won't be disappointed by the rich, savory goodness Amelie's has to offer: flaky croissants, rich, creamy Napoleons, thick and gooey eclairs, the works. But it's all not just belly-filling desserts at Amelie's; a slew of delicious sandwiches, soups, cheeses, and, of course, French breads are available for your liking, and they're all fantastic. Seriously, one can have a nice meal and a tasty dessert all in one sitting.

Since it's open 24/7, it stays busy all the time, so you might have a hard time scoring a place to sit. Amelie's, like any coffee and dessert joint offering free wi-fi, has its fair share of squatters, which can be a drag when all you want is to enjoy a coffee and an eclair and a nice place to sit. 

Still, perhaps a minor inconvenience for a major delight. Go to Amelie's now."}
{"text":"A well-loved local hangout with a caring staff and great peoplewatching. Lots of pastry choices, as well as soups, salads, and sandwiches. (My only complaint was the mushroom soup was in an excruciatingly salty onion base. I was thirsty for the next 2 days.) 
Go see this place if only to see how a three-bay concrete space can be turned into a charming cafe with creative painting, silly but friendly wall decorations, and funky painted furniture. 
Open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"All my friends love this place. I've been a handful of times (mornings) and tried multiple items in the case. food is either cold or stale.

The decorations and the staff were very nice. 5 stars for them!"}
{"text":"Very good desserts and pastries.  The line can be overwhelming at times but if you have the time to wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love, love the restaurant 
But the line and wait time to get food is ridiculous 
Every time I come it's at least a 25-20 min wait!!
Please get more staff and be more efficient"}
{"text":"This place is a legend in Charlotte and the food is worth it.  Everything is executed well whether it's a sweet treat or a sandwich, quiche or soup.  They can definitely do more to make the experience better such as having more employees during busy times and bigger counter to move people through more quickly but why when they are doing as well as they are.  I think that's part of the experience.  I have been there a couple of times where individuals on the  staff were not real friendly, however that has been the exception and are usually quite pleasant and helpful.  Food is good.  Lines are long, but have to experience it and once you bite into the food, the wait will be long forgotten."}
{"text":"I love that this place is open 24/7. Their macaroons are awesome and I love the various flavors!"}
{"text":"this place is so unique and has such a good vibe. everything is great about this place but it is always packed with people and i can never find seating. anyone in the charlotte area has to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Davidson location over 10 times and yes, I must like it if I keep going back but I have to say that the last couple of times the eating area was very dirty.  I realize the crowd combination turnaround time may lend itself to tables not being cleaned off, but last time it felt just plain grimy.  

The Asparagus Leek or Spinach leek soup is always excellent.  The salted caramel brownies are superb.  If they would do a deep cleaning and employ a few extra people to wipe down tables it would really be a big help!  I have ordered a graduation cake which was wonderful and worth the $70.00 price tag."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's so I was anxious to try this new location at Park Road.  Popped in after dinner and glad we did.  It's such a cute oasis at the Park Road Shopping Center Backlot.  Cute, signature eclectic decor with French flair.  

I had the seasonal caramel apple petit gateaux....so nice to look at and nice to eat!  Can't go without an Amelie's latte.  I don't know how they do it but they have the best lattes I have ever had. It's like rediscovering coffee all over again."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem! Anyone living in Charlotte or visiting should put this on your list!  I love the over-the-top three-level French-inspired interior.  Very eclectic.  A fun place.  This place is always busy.  Love the energy.  Don't forget to take a peek at the open kitchen through the big windows.  Doesn't everyone need a 24-hr French bakery?

The star are the deserts (especially the macarons).  I can never pass up the pistachio macarons, but they are all great.  Love the rainbow colors.  I've been to Laduree in Paris and I definitely think Amelie's can go head-to-head.  I also love the salted caramel brownie!  The lattes are wonderful!  I haven't tried the regular menu but it looks great."}
{"text":"How Disappointing. A \"French Bakery\" that makes awful croissants. One would think they would make the best ones in town. My advice for the best croissant in the area, go to The Fresh Market. (And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market.)
Although the product comes in frozen (I know, I know) at TFM, when they are baked just right, they are excellent. Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and I'm happy...
I did try some pastries at Amelie's but nothing to write home about. I tried a baguette and it was edible. I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen. 
Not worth the drive from Cornelius."}
{"text":"Amazing macaroons and éclair. Loved the vibe and the artwork on my cappuccino. Went to the location in Pineville, and loved the options."}
{"text":"Large and spacious for a Moms group, casual meetings or just a coffee date with friends. I ordered some macaroons which weren't too sweet, just perfect! Will definitely plan future outings here!"}
{"text":"Im not sure what the fuss is all about with this place. The coffee is marginal and the baked goods... almost as good as the coffee."}
{"text":"By far the BEST BAKERY I have been to EVER. I enjoyed the selection of pastries and coffees. There is wine available here as well. A very interesting place to meet for a treat. The decor is intriguing and comfortable. The staff is helpful as well as caring. Gluten free we choices too!"}
{"text":"What else can I say for a place that's a icon with 1101 reviews. Its definitely a place for any visitor ' must do' must see' must eat' to do list.
Excellent pastries, sandwiches , quiches, soups ..just everything is heavenly. The decor is so quaint, charming and oh so ooh lala French. 
Love this place with a huge heart and its Open 24/7"}
{"text":"This is a very cozy place; I loved the pastries and highly recommend them as they made me very happy. The customer service is outstanding and the establishment is very clean.
As for coffee, I'd would not recommend it; I ordered a latte and a cappuccino but they were both lattes. I don't think the person was sure as to what he was making and they both ended up lattes."}
{"text":"Went here to meet with a study group on a Friday night. It was busy, but not too busy to find a quiet enough table for 5. The food was good and prepared as described. The ambiance was relaxed and welcoming. I would go again."}
{"text":"The ambiance gets a great big 5-star rating.  Love this place so very much!  

The only pitfall is that the food is all super sugary.  I'm used to pastries and desserts from Europe, which are all lovely and not overly sugar laden.  The pastries at Amelie's are made the American way - covered and smothered in huge amounts of sugar.  Even the chocolate croissant is covered in a sugar glaze.  Why, oh why?

I love you though, Amelie's.  You're still a great pal."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude staff! Went to the Uptown location 3 times. First time: rude. Second time: friendly. Third time: over the top rude. Love their chocolate eclairs but I'm not spending my hard earned cash here.

First time: never been to any Amelie's but had tried an eclair someone gave me. I was looking for a menu for the pastries and asked the cashier and in a unfriendly tone she said: \"we don't have menus here!\" So I say: \"how do I know what pastries you have?\" She says: \"look at the case\". Fair enough though she could have withheld the tude.
I go to the case and the lady is exasperated due to lunch rush and does not hold back when serving me. I extend some grace due to the lunch rush situation and how that can get on someone's nerves. I go back to the cashier (same lady with the attitude), and I pay. Interestingly enough, she's scoping my receipt to see if I'm going to tip her. Geez... I wonder if I did. Would you? Exactly.
Second Visit: staff is different and nice. Pay attention to what I'm about to say because this is what caused issues during my third and final visit ever. 
I walk in, go to the cashier to order pastries and the cashier tells me that I don't need to go to him, just to simply WALK STRAIGHT TO THE PASTRY COUNTER IF I'M THERE TO BUY PASTRIES. 
I follow instructions so what do you think I do in my third visit? You got it!
Third Visit: I walk straight to the pastry counter and ask for an eclair. The lady behind the counter makes some weird face and then proceeds to tell me in a condescending as in \"you're so stupid\" tone: \"You just cut in front of all these people, like...\" I looked at the line and then looked at her and told her I simply did what I'd been instructed to do in my previous visit and that I never meant to cut in line (20 people! -- who does that on purpose?). I was so embarrassed. So I turned around and walked out.
Honestly, I think their pastries are good but not great. Being that Charlotte does not have many options at this point, I would have been a customer but I think that Amelie's has gotten too big for her bitches, I mean, her britches and their service is subpar. I won't be a patron to a rude business. It's a matter of principle. Will never return."}
{"text":"Love it! The whole place is fun. A bit cheaper prices would help the place to be even better!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot! Delicious Spinach Asparagus Leek Soup! I love everything about this place! The decor is creative and comforting. Excellent customer service & desserts!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte this past weekend, my friend took me here for dessert and I fell in love with this Parisian designed bakery. The decor of this place in a little bit romantic, a little bit eclectic and definitely fun (love the chandelier made out of mini pots/pans). I can't give it more stars because the desserts were hit & miss. I had 3 desserts, yes that's correct 3. The first was the best, a chocolate cup filled with passion fruit chocolate ganache: this was really good, smooth, loved the passion fruit flavor! The second was decent, a coconut macaroon: the outside was nice and crisp but the inside was not as soft as I'm accustomed to. The third dessert was a bit of a disappointment, it was an orange chiffon cake: the cake was quite dry, the frosting was too think for my taste. So I guess 2 out of 3 was not bad, so if next time I'm in Charlotte I'll have to try a few more."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good coffee and food. I had an croissant sandwich and cafe mocha and enjoyed every bit of it."}
{"text":"This place did not live up to the hype.  Amelie's is overpriced and food is so-so.  The croissant was cold, the soup was extremely pricey, and the sandwich had zero taste.  The only thing I didn't try was something from the dessert menu.  I tried to get something, but they said they ran out.  Now I'm not an expert baker or anything, but seeing how this is a bakery, why couldn't they just BAKE another dessert for me.  The atmosphere was nice, but compares nothing to going to a real BAKERY in a place like NYC.  And having free WIFI is great, but Panera Bread has that too, and at that, so does my house.  2 stars for this place."}
{"text":"Sweet place! Good food and eclectic surroundings. I hear it's open 24/7?"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place - I have always loved their Noda location, but rarely had the time to get over there. I was highly anticipating the opening of their uptown location.

Decor and service is on par with the other locations with the Parisian theme. I love the open bakery windows to watch the bakers decorate all the treats (I have already spent too many minutes drooling at the sight.)

Favorite foods are (obviously) the salted caramel brownie that pretty much tastes like magic, the soups are delicious (5 stars for the hearty vegan tomato soup!), macaroons, and the tartines are fantastic."}
{"text":"Alright, Amelie's has clearly built a reputation.  The Uptown location along with the NoDa location both have some fun and creative seating.  The coffee and tea options are probably the best offerings.  I feel like most of their pastries are just mass produced, over-priced, lower than expected quality.  It is a fun touristy experience, but not a place I would go regularly for a delicious treat.  I have visited the NoDa location a couple of times in April and May, I've tried a few of the macaroons (and honestly, I just don't like macaroons so no fault to Amelie's on this one), the salted caramel brownie was gritty from the sugar not breaking down, and the brioche a tet with espresso & chocolate was unimpressive.  Take your friends from out of town for the experience, but probably don't go regularly if you live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I would have to use the word pretentious to describe this place. I've been here more than enough time to realized that I've spent too much unnecessary time and money waiting in line to get mediocre pastries. Yes yes, it's the only French bakery in Charlotte that's open 24/7 so I guess in a way, you kinda don't have a choice if you're craving for pastries late night. 

I usually just get the Napoleon bc I gave up on everything else that are offered there but for the past few times, even the Napoleon is not even worth the wait anymore. The price keeps increasing and yet, it keeps getting smaller and smaller...why?  The macarons are wayyyy too sweet. They're supposed all be different flavors but to me, they all just taste like sugar.  Their croissants are way too soft to be French crossiants. Where's the flaky buttery goodness that a crossiant supposed to have?!? Their fruit tarts' crust is too dense. You can get one from Harris teether that'll probably taste the same for half the cost. 

Amelie's hasn't been the same and not particularly in a good way. Good for a late night hangout spot if you're still in college but not so great for good quality French pastries."}
{"text":"Amelie's is not for everyone. This place seems to always stay packed with Hipsters (with a capital H!), students, working professionals, older folks, and the most eccentrically adorned individuals you have ever witnessed. This is primarily due to its location in the North Davidson area (NoDa). The thing that keeps me coming back is the spinach soup. I never go wrong when I order it. The desserts are okay. I tried the sweet potato bread pudding and was not impressed. I think they make the mistake with it being to eggy. As a tip to the chef, leave out the egg white and only use the egg yolk. Also, I have never been served bread pudding without some kind of sweet sauce to be drizzled over it. Mine tasted rather dry and left much to be desired in the \"sweet\" department. Unfortunately, after my third bite, I begged one of the employees for some icing or agave. She directed me to the coffee bar and suggested honey. As outrageous as that sounds, the honey made it taste better, but definitely not a winner. The creme brulee is also okay. Perhaps a lot better than the bread pudding. I have enjoyed better, but I suppose the lower price coincides with the quality. Seating is alright, outlets are reasonable. The back of the building is quieter than the front which forever has a long line. I will say, the employees do their best to make sure you are not waiting too long though. I come back because it is a place to get work done and is open a whopping 24 hours. If my local Starbucks had the same hours, that is probably where you would find me all the time."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Amelie's. Oh Boy!!! I felt like a kid going to the local bakery for the first time. I ordered 3 macaroons; Rose, Lemon and vanilla. I also had the Almond cake and peach tart. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for years and all their bakeries are the best.  My french Uncle even agrees.  We love both the sweet and savory items."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and have some me time or go out with friends. The staff will start to recognize you after a few visits. good place to be.. The pastries are a bit pricy though."}
{"text":"Great Coffee House/Bistro/Bakery - Here in town on business and I had 2 meals here. Everything was fresh and tasty. Turkey & Brie on a baguette was great. The fruit compote really brought out the flavors. I did have a salted caramel brownie for dessert and it was sweet and delicious as promised. 

The next meal was the Mushroom & Chevre' Crepe. It was very filling and again very fresh. The macaroons were gigantic and tasty. 

The staff was courteous, smiled and were all very helpful. It has become my hangout place in Charlotte.

I will be back next time in town"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The breakfast sandwiches are a 10/10. Great atmosphere. Be careful not to come during peak hours because the line can be very long and you might have a hard time finding a seat, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amelie's is located in the back of Park Road Shopping Center, where there is plenty of parking.

I have been to a few of the other Amelie locations and they are all fantastic. A staple of this city in fact.

We took my in laws to Amelies this weekend, as it is a place we always take visitors! Fortunately, the Park Road Shopping location is about a mile from our house. I was excited to finally get to check out this location and it did not disappoint. Cute decorations that are consistent with all the other Amelies. French whimsical is what I call it. Lots of seating. We ordered a variety of desserts. I always go for the gluten free salted caramel brownie. (note: I am not actually gluten free but the server asked if she wanted us to change her gloves. We of course said no but if you are actually gluten free and reading this, know they will take care of not contaminating) and my husbands favorite is the chocolate torte. This location also has sandwiches, breakfast options, coffees and wine!! (yay for wine and desserts!). I also love the specialty drinks that they change with the seasons. 

Super excited for this new location and I know they will crush it here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service at both counters a little awkward. The  name shouting at the bar is for the birds. Omg"}
{"text":"First I was nervous they wouldn't have as many gluten free options as I would like - I was proven wrong. There were plenty of options.

The gluten free turkey bacon sandwich - was great. Gluten free bread isn't made in- house, they do get it from a vendor but it still had a great, fresh taste to it. You can order half or whole. I did half with their GF spinach, artichoke leek soup. 

Gluten free salted caramel brownie was good. I think it could be split. Sweet. Rich taste. 

Macaroons were really good. Mixed berry was a favorite. 

Almond tea cake was gluten free - very fresh, highly recommended. 

Overall I think it's a pretty good place to hangout at and have some sweets to share. There is outdoor seating as well. Affordable, & comfortable atmosphere.  I DO think their should be menus to look at while in line. I waited until I was next and asked the cashier what did she like best and went with her advice. :) lovely people."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have not written a review for Amelie's since this is my go to place when my sweet tooth hits!

Last night we were in the Noda area and decided to swing by and get a small dessert. So. Many. Options!!! We decided to split the ever delicious salted caramel brownie. I swear, this thing is like crack. We also got our our own mini mouse cups. These are perfect because they are bite size and allow you to fufill a craving without over indulging! I got caramel and my husband got espresso.

Amelies have everything from coffee to soups to salads to pastries to cakes to tortes....and the list goes on and on. My go to favorites are the creme brulee (they always have different flavors), the salted caramel brownie, the mousse cup with chocolate covered strawberry on top, and the chocolate croissant.

Notes:
-Open 24 hours
-There is usually a line, especially at the later hours. However, even when the line goes into the other room, it always moves very fast and is definitely worth the way."}
{"text":"Putting an Amelie's in Uptown was one of the best decisions made. Plus, this one serves wine and beer......Yes!

My husband and I go to this Amelie's just a handful of times a year. Sometimes we will grab wine and play cards or read a book. Sometimes I will go in the morning before work to grab breakfast. This location is huuuuuuuuge. Adorable decorations. Plenty of seating and I love that utilized glass walls so you can watch the chefs!

Last night I brought 12 middle school girls here for a bible study. We were able to easily find a table and chairs big enough. Everyone in the group got an assortment of drinks and goodies. I chose the gluten free salted caramel brownie and a hazelnut latte. I convinced a handful of the girls who hadn't had dinner to get the breakfast sandwich. I absolutely love the bacon and egg breakfast sandwich on a croissant. 1. It is the size of your face and 2. The bacon on it is amazing. All the girls agreed that it was spot on delish!

Amelies is a spot we take guests to when they visit and I actually like this location a bit better than Noda due to the size and layout."}
{"text":"Beautifully done Parisian/Drench decor. Slightly overpriced but great service. Tables and restrooms could have been cleaner.  Delicious desserts."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich. 15 minutes go by, nothing. I hail someone down and show her my receipt. She casually looks at it and says 'oh yeah, we'll get that right out'. No apology.

Literally less than one minute later they come out with the \"sandwich\", which looks like it was put together in less than one minute by someone wearing a blindfold. Half of it was just bread, the other half uneven chunks of meat. It looked like something you might see in a roadside gas station display. No apology.

I got a very strong vibe of SJW bigotry here and that they didn't want people like me in their store. Wish granted."}
{"text":"can't go wrong with the desserts at Amelie's but NoDa's location is better (tastier) to be honest."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been disappointed by Amélie's...other than soup prices so I don't buy it all the time.

Amélie's offers a variety of foods, sweets, and beverages.

This location is in the heart of uptown so it can get busy but every one there is great so you're not left wondering where your order is. The space is big, with a downstairs (and up) to the left side as you walk in. There was a bridal shower this particular day but you couldn't tell, it wasn't loud at all. You see a lot of people reading, or doing some sort of work on their laptops. 

It's a very eclectic place with random decor. Nothing matches. Nothing at all... and I love it. It gives it character and it's a breath of fresh air in Charlotte, NC.

On this visit I skipped sweets (controlling my budget and waistline ), but got a cappuccino and their spinach artichoke soup. This may be my favorite soup of all time (well, one that my mom doesn't make anyways). It's light, full of veggies, and so flavorful. I cook a lot myself and knowing what I can spend to make a huge pot of soup sometimes compared to buying a bowl of this makes me cringe. I believe a bowl is about 5-6 dollars and I can't fathom spending so much on the regular. I'd rather try to make it at home for cheaper... a few trial and errors and I think I'll get close . We were in the area, it was chilly so I couldn't say no to soup and cappuccino .

Cappuccino was great, reasonably priced and not Starbucks. Thank god... I don't think I can take that burnt tasting coffee much longer. 

Love this place, love the location, and love the vibe. Food is great, as are drinks. I wouldn't recommend going super hungry because you might buy all the sweets haha.

Definitely go if you're in town, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I went in I did not know what to choose so I purchased 10 different products that I shared with family and friends.  Flavored Macaroons, can't say much other than was not impressed. Napoleon thought I could share but the top crust is so hard, it is tough to cut n the cream spreads everywhere.  Apple tart was ok, eggclair n cream puff were probably a few days old n nothing to brag about.

The lemon tart w raspberries was sooo good and there were some other treats w sugar that were perfect.

Now that I have consumed so much sugar, I will  give you 3 stars because  I will be working it off for days and it was not all worth it and is overpriced.

Try it if you are in the area but not worth 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"A true oasis of originality in our very corporate-chain saturated part of Charlotte. The Pineville store is equally as charming and whimsical as the original NoDa location, the only bummer is this location is not 24 hours like the original Amelie's... Some of my favorite things are the Fruit Tart - I recommend purchasing the 8\" because it's THAT good and for $20 you get about 6 servings vs spending $6 on a single serving tart that you'll just be craving more when you're done!
Also... don't ask me why, but Amelie's yogurt is phenomenal! It is homemade and there must be a secret ingredient because I've never tasted yogurt so perfect before! Last but not least - the Chicken Salad sandwich and Spinach Leek Potato Soup will make you happy dance in your seat with each bite."}
{"text":"This was the first and only Amelie's location we've been to (so far, anyway). I ordered a turkey and brie half sandwich with a side of spinach, asparagus and leek soup. Enjoyed both. I was expecting more of a pureed soup, so I was surprised to get a thin soup with chunks of vegetables. It was delicious nonetheless, and I would order it again.

Enjoyed their sweet bread pudding. Their vanilla strawberry petit gateau was a tad too sweet for me with more white chocolate filling than cake. I would have preferred to have it the other way around. Their macarons were okay. My husband seemed to love his twice baked almond croissant and cinnamon pull-apart bread. He wouldn't share.

We all left happy with full bellies. Reasonable prices. A definite repeater."}
{"text":"Typically I am nervous trying out new restaurants but once i stepped foot into Amélies I instantly fell in love. The environment was adorable and the ladies behind the counter guided us through which pastries we would enjoy best. They were outstanding and so was the coffee. Definitely returning again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing hot chocolate. And a wide selection of bakery items and sandwiches . A great place to go and enjoy the company of friends and family and have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Amazing ! Magnifique! Everything French inspired ... love Love Love this place! Great atmosphere , multiple locations now .. which I love ! Free WiFi ! Amazing coffee, tea and sweets .. ohh and don't forget the awesome decor !"}
{"text":"WOW!!! We found this place by driving through NoDa and just stumbled in to check out the pastries.  As soon as I walked in , the line wrapped around to the back of the room!  I wish we have one in Richmond, Va!  It's a bit pricey, but doesn't hurt to indulge."}
{"text":"My favorite place for french press coffee and dessert. I LOVE that it's open 24/7 so I can get my fix whenever necessary. Great place to hang out with friends, study, or read a book. Get the salted caramel brownie...you'll thank me for this."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm. I wish there were more than 5 stars I could award it. 
Super friendly people who will answer your questions and the bakery dishes out some wonderful desserts."}
{"text":"This is my 5th time at Amelie's. I had to send back the food as it was cold, and things just didn't taste up to par.  I took home pastries that were excellent as usual.  I think from now on I will go just for the pastries."}
{"text":"I have no argument with the quality of Amélies food, but I ordered a jambon et fromage baguette and menu said Black Forest ham, choice of cheese on a buttered baguette. $6.29 al la carte  for just the sandwich, no sides. Then I was told 75 cents would be added for the cheese. So if you want fromage on your jambon et fromage sandwich you have to pay extra for the cheese of your choice. A little bait and switch as far as I am concerned. 
At least add the surcharge to the menu board."}
{"text":"Fun ambience and delicious food here. The spinach asparagus and leek soup is a favorite for lunch. The salted caramel brownie is to die for!"}
{"text":"I have to add that in my subsequent visits to Amelie's I have learned that their employees are very, very unhappy with their management, which is quite unfortunate to hear. For me, even an employee's happiness is important when it comes to where I spend my money.

To Management:

  Have a staff meeting. Ask why your employees are unhappy. Fix it. Your customers will be happier if your employees respect and trust you, and your employees will do a better job."}
{"text":"Chill spot and great pastries love to catch up with friends there! :)"}
{"text":"Nice coffee, excellent pastries, friendly service and comfortable quirky seating groups. What not to like?"}
{"text":"Fun place. Open 24 hours. Good pastries and coffee. Quirky decorations."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Amelie's which i'm happy about after living in Charlotte for a little over a year.  The bakery is cute and they have a decent selection of pastries and breakfast/lunch items as well.  I got a bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant which took about 20 minutes to get for some reason...not really sure why since we went on a down time and it was not busy at all.  The food was good though when I got it.  We got some pastries to go and they were ok - I've definitely had way better.  The prices a super expensive for pastries though IMO.  Overall, I would go back but not anytime so soon."}
{"text":"Love love love Amelies!! So much that we are using them for wedding for desserts!! best salted carmel brownies!"}
{"text":"Pasteries are slipping a bit in quality from the last time I was there"}
{"text":"Love this place. The noda location is conveniently opened 24 hours and the selection is to die for. It's always busy so plan on waiting in line for spectacular pastries and other liquid delights. I usually get a cappuccino and a dessert. Love the traditional European style. Great esthetics with crazy unmatchable tapestries, wall hangings, and vintage furniture. Worth a visit. Wish I had one closer to me!!"}
{"text":"We visited this Amelie's location for treats for my birthday. Everything in the case is so incredibly beautiful. So fun to shop with your eyes. The young man helping us was very nice and helped explain several items to us. We selected our items and had them packaged to go. 

Verdict. Macarons were the best thing we purchased - as has been the case on previous visits. The cinnamon sugar with chocolate filling is just divine. The rest of our choices were okay to bad. My husband had a chocolate cupcake/small cake that was pretty okay. My son chose a similar sized cake with white cake and strawberries. Big disappointment. First, the glazed strawberry on top was moldy!  Yup. Moldy!  There was no mold on the icing, but I cut around that part anyway. The cake flavor was very good. The buttercream is not to my liking at all!!!  I've tried it on a previous visit and thought maybe we had a bad batch. No. I completely understand that french pastries are often not as sweet as US versions, but this buttercream tastes like it has zero sugar. It basically just tastes like butter/fat. Given that the item was refrigerated, the icing is solidified and the mouth feel is identical to butter. Very off putting. Lastly, my other son's chocolate eclair was fine. Not great. Not bad either. 

All in all, considering the price, I will stick with a macaron if I visit Amelie's again."}
{"text":"Best deserts you'll ever have!! They have many options and the prices are very good. You can get dessert, salads, a sandwich, or some coffee. The environment is very nice and laid back. Good spot to hang out or to catch up on some work!"}
{"text":"went to the new HUGE one in uptown  / loved it  lots of options on seating / different levels  / lots of space / salted caramel brownie Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is unique. The atmosphere is inviting, calm, a place you want to hang out and spend some time. Service is friendly, plenty of seating, good food and outstanding coffee. Can't wait to go back when I'm uptown."}
{"text":"This edition of Exited about Eating is back in the US at Amelie's French Bakery in the NoDa (North Davidson) Arts District of Charlotte. This bakery, that also serves a variety of sandwiches, salads and other specialties, is a go-to place to quench not only your sweet tooth, but also your savory cravings.

Dora here. You can say that again. Wait until you catch a glimpse of their dessert counter. Yowza!

I ordered the Provence B.L.T with Red Potato Salad and because I had no idea what a Tartine was, a Ham & Gruyere Tartine. The B.L.T. was served on a crispy baguette with loads of bacon, lettuce, and mayo that combined for the perfect bite, crispy on the outside and loads of flavor on the inside.

The Tartine is actually an open-faced sandwich. The baguette was blanketed with ham and melted Gruyere cheese.

Dora here. Talk about gooey and cheesy delicious!! We could've made a meal on the tartine alone! But we didn't.

The Strawberry Candied Almond Salad called to me. Because you know I'm all for salads with fruit, right? Yum! I added chicken for protein and my mouth exploded with flavor with the almost-sweet balsamic vinaigrette and the crunchy candy almonds. Yum! My only negative about this dish would be that it was entirely spring mix (Ernie calls them \"weeds\"). I would've preferred romaine and should've asked for the switch. 

Still Dora, the interior is eclectic and homey, like a family dinner, with all sorts of conversations flowing and swirling around you. Can you spot my sweetheart in this pic? xo

Still Dora. What's up with the big guy? He petered out at the best part. lol. Of course, we couldn't pass by that bakery case without ordering dessert-awesome marketing ploy on their part, don't you think? The Monkey Bread (Ernie's choice) looks sickeningly sweet, doesn't it? But so not! So delicate, it reminded me of an apple fritter without the chunky apples. And that's a coconut macaroon next to it. I admit to being disappointed that it wasn't dipped in chocolate at first, but one bite of that chewy ball of coconut made up for it. Mmmmm.

Amelie's definitely made it on our \"must go back\" list.

{"text":"Amazing! The atmosphere along with the amazing treats they carry makes the whole experience amazing! I live in Kentucky and whenever I go to NC I always make it a stop! I can not wait to go back again and have more of the macaroons and also a chocolate cup filled with chocolate mousse and a chocolate covered strawberry on top! They also have amazing little cakes just big enough for two people."}
{"text":"Ahh, Amelie's.  I haven't been back to an Amelie's in six years, but it never disappoints.  The space is huge at this location and has plenty of space.  This space would be great for work or studying.

Amelie's has a massive, massive case of French macarons, tarts, brownies, creme brulees, cream puffs... the list goes on and on.  The prices are fairly reasonable, too.  They have a tea and coffee bar as well.  I'd recommend this place as a nice breakfast spot, afternoon snack, or after dinner dessert.  It might even be a good place to take a date :)

After a long and hard decision, I decided to get the salted caramel brownie.  It was delicious!  It's much less brownie than it is a salted caramel... bar.  I didn't really taste all that much chocolate, or at least it wasn't overpowering.  I actually prefer this.  The whole thing was probably a billion calories as it was really rich and buttery (but not too much!) - so worth it.  Have these on your cheat day.

I also had a blue and yellow (lavender and chamomile) tea with my little dessert.  Perfect for a relaxing evening dessert.

I will definitely be back to try the other desserts.  Maybe even for breakfast if I want to indulge."}
{"text":"My wife and kids really like going to this place...I'm still waiting for someone to show me what the hype is all about.  I go when they want to go (as this is what a married man with young kids do), but I still have yet to get something that I thought was WOW.  Went there he other day and I got a pecan bun.  It tasted ok (hard to screw up a pecan bun anyway) but again I;m simply waiting for the wow as I keep reading in all the other posts on Yelp."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try the new location in South Charlotte. Loved the decor and the menu looked promising. Could not stay to dine in, so I bought a small vanilla cake with a strawberry on top, to take home. And while it looked absolutely mouthwatering, I have to say that I was really disappointed in it. I cut it in half to share with my grandson, and the cake fell apart. Not in a good way. The cake completely separated from the frosting that was on top and in the middle. And neither had any taste to it. It was like eating cardboard. We did not even finish the half, after 2 bites each, we threw it out, plus the other half in the box. While I was not expecting it to taste like a pastry shop in Paris, I did expect alot more from a $7 cake."}
{"text":"This is the cutest place - you'll feel like you're in Paris when you walk in.  I had a delicious breakfast sandwich and coffee and we brought some pastries to the office. Very affordable and friendly staff - very highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"A very trendy dessert bakery and coffee shop in the North Davidson area of Charlotte (NoDa).  Aside from their desserts they also serve soups and sandwiches which are very good.  The prices on the desserts are on the high side.  Decor is...well you should just see it for yourself.  I'm not really sure how to describe it.  Feels crowded but unique.  

EVERY single time I have come in here there is always a line of 10+ people.  Often times 20+ people wrapped around into the lounge area.

TRY their 
Spinach Asparagus Leek soup
Salted Caramel Brownie

Pros: Good quality and delicious desert, food, and drinks.

Cons: Long wait.  Hard to find a place to sit (you can also try your luck in the atrium that it is connected to), desserts are on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Only giving this place 2 because there's a good atmosphere to it. It's a great place to get some studying done or a get together with a friend. The desserts do not live up to the hype and overpriced. The only thing I actually like is the blossom honey iced tea."}
{"text":"Great bakery overall with fantastic cookies. The macaroons were OK but there were so many flavors. This place is popular and the line can sometimes be long."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location because it's not as small as NoDa but smaller than Uptown. I've visited several times and only once was I lucky enough to get a slice of this PB Chocolate Cake ... Oh My Goodness - it blew me away and I really hope they make it again ( & that it's there on a day I come in! ) My favorite coffee drink is the Cafe Marcotter, even delicious iced. The fresh fruit tarts are heaven as is the salted caramel brownie (try the torte!!)

The staff is incredibly friendly (especially Tamara & Gantt), eager to help. Bathrooms are immaculate like the rest of this restaurant. I'm excited to hear they'll be staying open until 1a soon...I'll be coming in with my friends to enjoy the local beers and wine.

Welcome to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Very \"NoDa\" type place. good amount of places to sit, but places is always packed so you might have to wait awhile for a seat. Prices are a bit high, but that is to be expected at a fresh french bakery. 

Leek soup and ham sandwich is awesome. baked goods are beautiful and good. haven't had anything spectacularly good but no actual complaints. I've been here a few times and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Just had (tried to have) their \"signature chicken salad on a fresh croissant\".  

The chicken was rubbery/chewy and bland tasting.  The chicken salad was dull.  The croissant tasted a day old.  

I like this place and come early in the mornings for fresh croissants (honestly not far off from doing the same at any decent bakery in France).  I will stick to the croissants and other mornings foods, coffee included of course!"}
{"text":"Place is cute. Super busy, but that's fine. Sweets are great, but way to over priced. Still a great place to go and hang out at any hours of the day and night."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this side of town has an Amelie's! They kept the same unique aesthetic alive in this location which has tons of indoor and outdoor seating. Just walk down the steps and the line to order is on your right, or take the accessible entrance and walk through the cafe to get to the line. Either way, it's small enough to feel cozy but big enough to always find a seat. Great staff, very clean, completely awesome."}
{"text":"\"Expectation is the thief of joy\". This location is large, unique and comfortable. The coffee is stunning and their food is fantastic. I have been to NoDa a handful of times and prefer this location. Though some are let down because this location is not like NoDa, that steals the magical joy this cafe brings. So order a Te Glace, have some soup or a pastry and find your mismatched chair to relax in. You can go back to NoDa anytime, but don't let that steal the light of this wonderful place."}
{"text":"After moving to the area, my SO and I were given the recommendation to check out this bakery.

We made the trip over on a Sunday morning. It was a bit of a drive from where we live, but it was highly recommended.

We got there and due to the early morning day/time, it wasn't busy.

After a brief study of the pastry case, we made our selections. Palmiers, a couple of croissants, an eclair, and a few other things.
We took our items to go in our usual practice of eating at home.

The quality and taste overall was a bit \"meh\". It seemed like they didn't use full butter and cream that is expected from French pastries. Perhaps, lower quality substitutes? 

The overall conclusion was that we've had better and it wasn't really worth the trip. The layout and decor was a bit artsy and a little overdone. It seemed cluttered to us, but take into account that we are both trained to look for points of egress in an emergency. 

You can probably take the review with a grain of salt because I've been cooking and baking for 26 years and taught culinary for a number of those years and we've both been all over the world and had many local cuisines in our travels. Our expectations tend to be higher than most."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, on the recommendation of a coworker. Great and fun decor. And I really like the food! I had what is called a Bouchée , it was very delicious. By the way, if you love macaroons please, please, please, try their's.  They make them in house, and I recommend the pistachio."}
{"text":"Favorite location. Lots of interesting designs, fun places to sit, great food and drinks. Theres a full bar here too! Truly nothing quite like Amelie's anywhere else. French inspired decor and treats in a fun and whimsical setting. I've made it my mission to try a new macaron every visit.

UPDATE (7/28): The manager here has an amazing story, if you're ever lucky enough to meet Ryan, get him to tell you his story. The employees here are some of the kindest people I've met. After a strange set of circumstances, one employee gave me free macarons and a salted caramel brownie and I was blown away with their kindness. To most people this is just a cafe, but for me it's much more than that. It's a magical little escape with my favorite tea and the kindest people."}
{"text":"NODA location: Great for late nights, mid-day snacks, and fun conversations with friends. It can get packed and the layout is a bit small. This is the trendiest location and worth checking out, especially if you're fond of hipsters.

UPTOWN: Huge interior, fantastic food and tons of seating. Beautiful decor, outdoor patio, friendly service.

CARMEL RD: A large room w/ small outdoor seating. Good selection of pastries and food. A more laid-back neighborhood vibe. Maybe some little old ladies meeting up to knit, a child's bday, who knows.

No matter the location, Amelie's ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the sandwiches here, but Amelie's used to slice the meat very thinly. The last few sandwiches I've eaten have had very thick slices of meat almost like they were carved for dinner. It's kind of off-putting on a sandwich. Please go back to the days of yore, Amelie's.

Edit: bumped up a star based on response. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bakery of all time (and I have tried many!). I think that the constant crowd at all hours of the day is proof that this place is amazing! When I first walked in, my eyes almost glazed over and my salivary glands kicked into overdrive at the sight of the very long glass display case of pastries. They were all beautiful and obviously artfully made by people that know what they are doing. If you couldn't find a pastry here to completely satisfy your visual and gustatory senses, there might just be something wrong with you. Also, the eclectic feel is very welcoming and sure to make you feel like have teleported to Paris.
But don't be fooled, it isn't just the pastries that have people coming back to Amelie's, the actual food is to die for too! I have tried the ham and gruyere tartine and the sweet potato soup. The tartine had the perfect amount of very good quality cheese and the baguette that supported it was crispy but delicious. It is also a perfect portion and not very expensive. The soup was very smooth and had a perfect balance of flavors. I love sweet potatoes and I think they nailed this variation of sweet potato soup. It is perfect for a cold day!
I tried the vanilla eclair and an assorted fruit mini tart. The tart was the perfect size and there were so many varieties that all looked picture perfect and fresh. The crust was not too sweet but perfect to compliment the custard interior and the fresh fruit on top. The chocolate eclair was very large and not quite the shape of others I have had before. However, the custard was delicious and there was lots of it! You can even have an eclair customized for Valentine's Day which I might be requesting next year.
I have heard that the salted caramel brownie is out of this world from all of my friends and I will definitely be making the trip soon to try this and a few more of their pastries! I hope to become an Amelie's connoisseur!"}
{"text":"What is not to love about Amelie's French Bakery! Everything is so fresh and yummy! My favorite is the crème brulee but I love absolutely everything I have tried from here. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The desserts are excellent, but the prices are outrageously high; more expensive than major cities like New York or Los Angeles. Great atmosphere, good service, just know going in that a few bites of cake will cost more than $5. It's good cake, but...yea. Too expensive."}
{"text":"I love this place; unfortunately, I can never get anything when I visit because there is a 5 mile line that stretches into the other room. Come here when people are out of town (e.g. Spring break, holidays). I look forward to their other place opening to cut down on the overwhelming number of people who go to this one."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with their salted caramel brownies!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday ( 1/23/18)Took my bff of 40+ years to Amélie's for a late afternoon lunch. Our cashier and server Katie and her co worker ( a charming young man with dredds) were just wonderful explaining the different products offering suggestions and patiently waiting for my pal to decide on her food. Then for the moment of truth when the food arrived it more than lived up to its description. My friend had the spinach Asiago  tartine and a petite coffee creme and I had the combo-signature spinach leek soup and /2 turkey Brie baguette and for a beverage the salted caramel hot cider. While waiting for our drinks at the coffee bar those employees were knowledgeable friendly and informative.After our meal we went back to the counter and were once again wonderfully guided through the various and plentiful dessert selections. I was so happy to have introduced a friend  from out of state to Amélie's and have it show its best side ! We settled on the famous salted caramel brownie and dark chocolate gateau .I also purchased a baguette which is the best in Charlotte. Once again fabulous!Bravo!!"}
{"text":"This bakery is a great place to get your fix of delicious pastries and coffee as well as find a spot to do hunker down and get some work done. 

At my visit I had the pumpkin cream puff and cinnamon dark chocolate macaron. The cream puff was really good, the filling tasted just like pumpkin pie. The macaron was also very tasty. I've had the soup and half baguette before too, which hit the spot late at night. 

Another perk of Amelie's is that they are open super late so you can do work until late into the evening or stop by for a midnight snack. There's ample seating and the building seems to extend forever. The decor is also eclectic and unique, with mismatching furniture, couches, and fun wall decor. 

This place is a must-visit for anyone who lives in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going there at 4:30-5 am sitting and talking, enjoy a pastry and cup of coffee, it's unique decor and atmosphere are great. Only reason it got a 4 was cleanliness. I know it can sometimes happen when your short staff and real busy, but eveytime we go in there cleanliness is an issue, it's not an exception it's the norm. I do appreciate that they just got a new cushion for our favorite seat."}
{"text":"Interesting hangout place with very trendy interiors for late night lovers. Good options for quick French bites and beer lovers."}
{"text":"Heat atmosphere and friendly staff. Food was good and they have a wide selection of desserts that taste great.  Place has long hours as well which make for late night snacking a real possibility when visiting the city."}
{"text":"Love this place! The best coffee and pastries around. It is the cutest little spot and the staff is very friendly. They offer a variety of macaroons which are my favorite!

I can't wait to try the macaroon ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The gluten free salted caramel was spectacular! Wowzer!

The chocolate cake which my husband enjoyed is pictured! Very, very good!

Plus, I love the eclectic look and feel too! We went to the 24 hour one!!!"}
{"text":"First I would like to begin by saying \"TED is the man!!!\" and 'TEd for PRESIDENT!\". I guess you might be wondering exactly who \"Ted\" is. Well Ted works at Amelie's. He provides that type of customer service that is rare these days. Great listener and extreme professional!!! Last week was sort of a rough week for me. (Let's just say someone very close to be had a birthday on Tuesday and the anniversary of their death was Wednesday. Always two pretty rough days each year.) Anyway, do their best to try to cheer me up during those rough days. They know I LOVE the Vanilla Chiffon cake at Amelie's. When I got home from work I had roses, a cooked dinner and guess what?!! Yep. You guessed it! Vanilla Chiffon Cake from Amelie's!!! When it was time to enjoy my cake, I dug right in. For the first time in history, the cake was not good. I wanted to CRY! I thought about it for a moment. What was I to do? I have NEVER had anything from Amelie's that wasn't amazing. So, I took a chance and called. I was a little anxious because my mood wasn't the best and I was hoping not to get hassled. I called and \"TED\" answer the phone. He listened to my concern and immediately apologized for my dissatisfaction. He offered an immediate resolution that was beyond what I expected. (Remember, I have NEVER complained about anything at Amelie's so I had no expectations.) \"TED\" was pleasant, polite and attentive. At the end of such a heartbreaking day, \"TED\" provided a pleasant surprise. Might seem small to some, but he truly made my day! My daughter and I went back to Amelie's earlier this week and I had the pleasure of meeting \"TED\". I thanked him for the pleasant experience! He had no idea what he did for me that day, he was just happy to have the opportunity to provide superior customer service. He thanked me for my business and smiled as he welcomed the next customer. Ok, I was already in love with this place. But if Ted is the standard for their customer service, then I will continue to return. Amazing food AND amazing service? What more could you ask for? Get yourself to Ameilie"}
{"text":"My father and I took a trip to Paris last year with a few other family members.  Upon our return to the states, he found Amelie's and has been talking about it ever since.  I'm in Charlotte visiting, and finally got to go this morning...if I lived in the area full time, I'd be at Amelie's once a week!  The decor is awesome - French shabby chic - and the food is even better.  The chocolate croissant was a very good replication of my favorite French breakfast (though the chocolate is a bit sweeter than it's French counter-part), and they have macarons!  I'll definitely be back soon to try a breakfast sandwhich and more pastries."}
{"text":"Have a dirty chai with almond milk, it's the best coffee I've ever had. Ever. Get a baguette with pimento and jam. And then get a chocolate torte and a salted caramel brownie. Perfect meal with an exemplary staff. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Salut Yelp! ca va? moi? Je suis bien!

What can I say about Amelie? other than it's a really creepy French movie, however this is a 24 hour bakery!! 20 FREAKING 4 HOURS! 

I was so hyped to go here! My second night in Charlotte I had to go. I went around 11 at night, and it was pretty busy! There was a lot in the case I would have thought they would be empty. NOPE!
The interior of the bakery was kinda over the top. with RB and hip hop music. I was expecting French tones. Oh well that's not the issue here

The pricing as okay... not a fan of the pricing on the little bits. almost 2 bucks for a small that can be eaten in one chew. NO thank you! 

The tarts however were yummy, about 4 bucks or so which is what I would expect, in KC it would have been 5 or 6 dollars. 

My biggest issue, the french macaroons. The cookie was made correctly, however the filling was not. It was like they just got jelly from the store and spread it on. And the creme... was it creme?! Idk, but it was horrible! 

If you all every had French macaroons you know the filling is what makes the cookie. and I wasted about 12ish dollars on 5 macaroons in which I only ate1/2 of one. My gf ate 1 and we just left the rest in the hotel trash

Would I come back? probably they also have a real food menu too. I've give it a try again but won't be buying the french macaroons."}
{"text":"Okay here's the thing, I'm a sucker for great quirky decor.  There I said it.  The inside is awesome with the mismatched furniture and chandeliers.  Totally dig.  Yes, it's busy a lot, yes it's open an insane number of hours but the coffee is always good and fresh.  The only 2 things that make me less than stoked about Amelie's are the staff and the food....  The pastries are so-so and hit or miss.  When they are good and FRESH they are delicious but when they have been sitting in the cold case well, they've been sitting in the cold case.  The staff is very nice but not what I would call enthusiastic, kinda like walkers are waiting on you.  Maybe it's the long hours?"}
{"text":"Amelie's is perfect for a late night dessert whether you are cramming all night or stopping by after a night out. There pastries and coffee drinks are delicious and there is always a crowd for a reason!"}
{"text":"This place always has great deserts 24 hours a day. There is always a line, but it moves a lot faster than you'd think. Good coffee too. The hot chocolate has got good flavor, but is more like room- temperature- chocolate. And usually has enough seating for all."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one to say this but Amelie's has seen better days. The desserts are not of the same quality or consistency as before. I really hope that they turn this around."}
{"text":"My reputation for copious sugar consumption apparently has not preceded me all the way to Amelie's, when advised: \"wow, someone's going to be doing extra laps\"

Thanks for the sugar-shaming but it's been forever since I'd last been here & I'll definitely admit my eyes were bigger than my stomach.....but shouldn't that have made you happy at the big sale, instead of making me feel guilty about purchasing so much?  Plus, I'm a now & later kind of girl so this lasted me for days.......

But my bigger lesson learned, was that I should reread my own reviews b/c I got sucked into delish-looking treats that actually weren't as delish-tasting as they appeared.....& then I saw I had tried them before & made note to skip.  Oh well, lesson reinforced!  Here was this visit's damage:

Salted Caramel Brownie - the brownie layer continues to remain very thin & grainy from the sugar - it hadn't fully dissolved in the baking process & combined w/ the soft caramel layer, the overall effect was grainy & greasy - will def pass on this next time

Peach Tart - looking forward to being peach season, I didn't read my note about there being little peach flavor & the 1st assessment still held true - there was an abundance of lemon & hardly any peach

Brownie-Salted Caramel Chocolate Torte - this was a new indulgence for me & it was phenomenal!  Take a blondie brownie w/ chocolate chips ( or a toll house bar cookie, if you will ) & put a layer of whipped cream in between, then add a small salted-caramel layer on top & you're talking 1 seriously delish torte

Cream Cheese Muffin - the pastry part was nice & flaky & crumbly.  More cream cheese would have made this even better

Sticky Bun - the caramelized topping had hardened to the point it was like a toffee candy.  Would have preferred much more goo!

Twice-baked croissants - there was only 1 left by the time I got there & the croissant was not crispy or flaky at all - it had been over-saturated by whatever liquid they soak it in before the 2nd \"bake\" so it was flavorful but not really almondy or croissant-like

So for the off-day pastries ( my unwise choices ) & the snarky comments, this experience was just an A-OK"}
{"text":"Learned about this new location of Amelie's opening & came to check it out.  I've had a hit & miss experience at their other locations & this was no different....although there were many more hits

Mushroom & onion quiche with Gruyere- crust was flakey but the quiche was dense & super flavorful. This is a repeat!

Twice baked Almond croissant - super moist & subtly almondy - repeat!

Pecan tart - this is a southern staple & these guys did it right. Tender crust & lots of buttery pecan throughout - repeat!

Macarons - even though most were raw on the inside, I was a fan in concept. Longer in the oven definitely required. Got 1 of each & here's the rundown

Jalapeño- weird flavor that tasted more gelatinous & half raw on inside

Basil-lime - raw but surprisingly nice compliment of flavor

Pistachio- subtle nut flavor

Raspberry little bit raw, real raspberry jam (seeds). Intense raspberry flavor

Salted caramel - this tasted like chocolate. No caramel taste. Wonder if it was mislabeled 

Cinnamon ganache - CINNAMON. Just like biting into a cinnamon stick

Bourbon vanilla peach streusel - raw. Peach jam & maybe a slight cinnamon flavor to represent \"streusel\"

Mixed berry - dry with whole strawberry inside

Lemon - raw. No lemon taste

Milk chocolate passion fruit - bit raw but nice compliment of chocolate to passion fruit

Honey - my fav. Lovely honey aftertaste. Light creamy perfect crisp

Orange - very orange w a vanilla cream. Like a dreamsicle

So when traveling back to the Uptown area, you'd best believe there will be another ginormous box of Amelie's goodies!"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I visit Charlotte. The atmosphere is unique and all the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it is so cute!! I'm still on the fence. The food was pretty good, but sightly overpriced and the line was ridiculous. The line makes you anticipate that you are going to be eating something amazing and while they're good-I wouldn't say amazing. Not much they can do about it, but the line was like 30 people deep. Will probably go again, but NEVER on a weekend."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious.  My husband and I found ourselves in the neighborhood when we were running errands on a Saturday afternoon so we stopped in for lunch. The lunch was a perfect meal and we left with a box of pastries for later. We will be back!"}
{"text":"food was good.  very popular place.  so you better like crowds.  but they seemed to move people in and out pretty fast."}
{"text":"This place looks amazing, good hot beverages, but their cake was nasty. Felt like I was eating butter"}
{"text":"From reading other reviews (and my sister's personal experience), I was worried the line would be extremely long but we waited only about 15 minutes on a Friday night around 8:45pm. 

We ordered LOTS of desserts - chocolate eclair ($3.49), cream puff ($2.09), mixed berry 4\" tart ($4.89), lemon raspberry fruit tart ($4.89), mini chocolate ganache cake (?), salted caramel brownies ($2.29), coconut macaroons ($1.59), pistachio flavored petit-four ($2.09), espresso mini mousse cups ($1.59), and every flavor of french macarons they had available ($2.29).. 

They had many workers restocking, but only 1 person taking orders and 1 person working the cash register. Is this to regulate the flow of the line? It must slow down the line because the person taking the order has to tell the cashier everything in the order, and if the cashier doesn't hear everything, then it's just chaos.


Any way, I personally didn't try everything we ordered so I can only give my sweet-tooth loving opinion on some of the items..but the chocolate ganache cake is highly recommendable. Not too rich and I loved the filling. It can be split between two people. The espresso mini mousse cup was not as great as it sounds. Bite-size and not as fluffy as I wanted. The salted caramel brownie is, if not the best (read in many other reviews), one of the most popular items.. but I thought the caramel was way too much. It is what contains the salt of course and the brownie would just be a normal chocolate brownie without it.. because the brownie alone did not taste like any chocolate worth remembering. Lastly, the cream puff is filled with custard which is something I love, but it isn't worth $2. I mean, it's huge, so if you really love cream puffs, have at it. Order it alone or split it with someone and order one other item."}
{"text":"Although the lines can be unbearably long, I'm always down to wait for their delicious, delicious baked goods. We always try to stop at Amelie's when we're in the area. Our default order tends to include salted caramel brownies (duh), macaroons, eclairs, and occasionally a mousse cup or tart of some sort.

Just like their pastries, their drinks are delish as well. Coffee is good and I've tried their lavender lemonade as well."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot hidden in a shopping center lot before the main NODA area. Lots of room to sit and chill out with your coffee and delicious treat in hand. They have board games in the back room and a quiet atmosphere if you want to read or get some work done. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got a couple eclairs and macaroons. 2 of the eclairs had very runny filling, and the other was a bit stale feeling but better overall. Two of the macaroons were good but the other two were a bit hard and chewy as if they were also stale. The original location has always been good but I feel like with the expansion theres been a drop in quality. Doesn't seem to be affecting business though because they were busy as ever. Hopefully next time will be better."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here twice while in town for a wedding.The breakfast sandwich was very good and the pecan sticky bun lived up to it's name!You also get a show with your meal  as the large windows  allow you to watch the bakers do their thing!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable dessert and their salted caramel brownie is to die for!  Expect a line, that is how good they are!"}
{"text":"LOVE this bakery...they have it spot on when it comes to desserts of any kind!!!! My favorite is the salted caramel brownie and the macaroons. PLUS, this place is open all night, so lots of people go to study there and hang out. Sometimes they have live music or events."}
{"text":"We have bought bread from Amelie's for years and have always enjoyed the purchase.  In the early years I think they made the bread on the premises.  In recent years they have started making the bread ahead of time and freezing it.  I prefer the old way because the bread was always favorful and tender.  It's rather tough these days although it remains good and goes well with soups and stews."}
{"text":"The two employees we dealt with were surly.  My chocolate croissant was kind of dry.  My partners Croque Monsier was delicious as was our French Lavender Lemonade.  We would go back, but I definitely think a refresher of customer service is in order (old lady at register, and younger chick with braids running food I'm looking at you..)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is so cute and cozy!  My husband and I love to come here and have a delicious treat and just sit and talk!  Great spot for a little date night!"}
{"text":"24 Hours a day, awesome! When it comes to their sweets and pastries they are hit or miss to me. Not saying that they aren't consistent just that I have some things that are better than others.  Triple berry tart never fails. Apricot roll eh. But they have teas, coffees, and savory things. I think this place is all about what you get. If I had only tried one thing there I would not have cared if I went back or not. That being said its not a bad place its just not my favorite to die for bakery in the city."}
{"text":"I tried 6 different pastry items and a coffee drink, and the only good thing was the coffee. For the $30 I spent, it was horrible, the portions were small and it was a complete waste of time. DO NOT go there, just go to Nonas. Much better!"}
{"text":"How much of this is made in house? 

Looking into the kitchen and seeing the sea of teenage to barely twenty faces makes me think that most of it is. Tasting the Macaroons, which are thick and stick to your teeth makes me think most of it is. Eating the salted caramel (the most popular item? this unbalanced, too sweet piece of poo? really?) while the caramel turned to liquid makes me think most of it is. 

The coffee is forgettable. The mediocre sandwiches take forever. 

The service is friendly.

Someone! Please! Open a patisserie that doesn't suck."}
{"text":"The fancy deserts are not the only interesting item at Charlotte's only actual French bakery and cafe. The cast of characters that take up on both sides of the counter. You know right away quand vous entrez (when you enter) that someone has visited France and \"gets it\". It took a very long time for Charlotte to obtain a square of land from the city of Lyon. It's real French edible art without the 8 hour flight."}
{"text":"So, I'm on the hunt for an eclair made the way my favorite bakery back in San Diego made them: a long, wide generous size filled with a sweet, light vanilla pastry cream (as in not pudding-heavy and not whipped cream-light) with a rich, glossy decadent chocolate glaze. It definitely took more than four bites to eat. While I do like the traditional thin French ones, I find I need more than one to satisfy me and they often have a high pastry shell to cream ratio. So, when I was considering relocating to Charlotte, I was excited to hear that a popular place was a French bakery called Amelie's. I eagerly tried their eclair and was sad it wasn't like my old favorite. But that's not to say it isn't good. It's just different.

I tried both their vanilla and chocolate version. While good, I found their filling dense and heavier than I would have liked. I didn't give up on them though. Their vanilla cream puff is closer to what I was hoping for. The glaze is rich, soft and glossy and balances the pastry shell and vanilla cream filling nicely. I do find the filling a tad too light than I would like, but it's pretty good. There's no suffering involved eating 2-3 to equal my old favorite eclair size. I'm still on the hunt, so read my other reviews to see if I've found the \"one.\"

I've also had their salted caramel brownie. It's a moist fudge-like brownie as opposed to a cakey brownie. Very tasty and yummy with a cup of their cafe au lait. Their twice-baked croissant was delicious. They were serving a chocolate hazelnut version when I ordered. It made a delicious snack along my drive to Arlington, VA that day.

While they didn't match my favorite eclair style, they're a delicious and solid bakery option and still deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Chocolate mousse cups and eclairs are my favorite!  This place is so fun and funky, it's open 24 hrs and has free wi-fi.  It is a little expensive, but still worth the splurge once in a while!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Too bad, I cannot visit everyday. Anyone who lives in surrounding areas should visit and indulge."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing.  They get the subtle sweet balance right! I hate overly sweet pastries, and these are perfect.  Macarons are the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Always open & always fantastic.
The potato leek soup is a must try.
My favorite sandwich is the Seeded Roast Beef. Mmmmm!
Salted Carmel Brownie is a great choice as well.
The high speed wifi is much appreciated; making Amelie's Bakery a great place to work for a few hours.
Always hits the spot late night too!"}
{"text":"The desserts are to die for, and the 24 hour thing is a big plus. Amelies is always on my schedule when I visit the NoDa area. French press coffee: 10-10, Salted Caramel Brownies: 10-10, $1 Baguettes with cheese spread: 100-10 (that extra zero is not a typo...best cheap meal in town). The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes there is no seating available and it is so packed it takes 30 minutes to get to the front of the line and get your food.....but I guess awesome places like Amelies can't avoid the crowds because the place is just so dang good! If you're visiting Charlotte, don't skip over this place as it is a must-see. Amelies also designed and baked all the pastries in the Hunger Games movie, which I thought was a fun fact. Also worth noting: This place is great for a first date since it's pretty casual. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was in Raleigh everything was so fresh and perfect the baguettes jams Tea French macaroons EVERYTHING I came with my girlfriend brittany we spent the day in Charlotte getting apartment stuff and it was great midday pick me up HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Noda Amelies for years and expected the same kitschy, hipster, just okay place as that one. WOW was I wrong!
This place is gorgeous!!!!!! It's massive, and absolutely beautiful with a large outdoor patio as well. It is SO much more upscale and classy than the noda location.
They also have 2 bars with beer and wine, and what seems like a LOT more food and drink options. 
I had the salted carmel brownie latte and oh my gosh, best thing I've ever drank!
If you're not a fan of sweet latte's obviously pass on this, but it was absolutely incredible!
I can't say enough good things about this Amelies.
The only con the is the parking since it's in the middle of uptown charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a good place to come to work or hang out with friends. It's hard to find a table so you may have to sit in the weird dark sketchy tunnel section in the back. The atmosphere is cute and eclectic. The food is just okay, expensive and tiny portions. the only thing worth getting is the spinach asparagus leek soup, that's really good.
I wouldn't come here for the food, more as just a hang out spot"}
{"text":"Ive only been here after hours so I can attest that it's a good drunk spot but never have tried them sober but if you are looking for diversity and uniqueness this is the place for you, be aware though many of their items contain nuts so if you have allergies this will be a tough go"}
{"text":"Venue: Amelie's French Bakery

Decor:   Unique, almost hippy(ish) if that's even a word.  It's just different

Service:  Cool, somewhat works fast as a team 

Environment:   Small groups, couples, friends meeting, solo venturing to get work done or to relax

Food:   Pastries (from what I saw), cakes, bread, soups, breakfast sandwiches

Prices:   Very affordable, not expensive

Huge Pros: 24 hours Operating

Debbie Downers:  It can be very crowded in somewhat a decent size space.
 
Conclusion:   I am a fan of their Chai Latte.  Very good stuff.  I like the place.  Really like that it is 24 hours, that's pretty cool.  It's a glorified Starbucks

Overall: It's in a quiet section not too far from Uptown charlotte.  It's a nice laid back kind of venue.  The service can be better but other than that, It is a place I would not mind people to hang out, relax or get work done.

Grade: B"}
{"text":"Great place for tea and a crossiant while getting some work done. I spent a couple days a week here while job hunting and it was a great spot. 

Also a great spot for a get together. Went to a bridal shower here that was very well done."}
{"text":"Great place, love the actual building and sitting areas, really enjoy most of their food and coffee, just dislike the way they bake my favorite pastry ( the cream puff pastry), they always over cook them and it tastes burned. When I spoke with them they told me that's how they like them cooked. The people are kind and welcoming.  But it tends to get a bit loud in there so I like sitting out in the hallway behind the shop, and the WiFi is slow there, so it's great for social get together's."}
{"text":"The good: the pastries and coffee is amazing. 

The bad: you can never find a seat. I used to come here to study but it's really not somewhere to concentrate. The baristas are sometimes more interested in anything but you're drink (and keep in mind I don't mind waiting for a good drink). 

Other than that I will say they have the best decor of anyone else."}
{"text":"I go to Amelie's because of their free Wi Fi (even though it is pretty slow and unsecured) and delicious, bold coffee. I don't know how someone can't like Amelie's..... it's such an eclectic mix of everything-decor, people, pastries, smiles, hipsters and drinks. Of course, the one thing that Amelie's has that many other places don't is the open- 24 -hours-factor. That is one of my major gripes about places in this area since I moved from the west where there seemed to be alot more 24 hours places. Why don't more businesses in the area see that that right there is a cash cow? Plus, I believe freaks come out at night so it's a fabulous people watching experience. Anywho, the fact that they are open 24 hours and I actually feel safe walking to and from my car at 1AM or 2AM is a major plus. 

Their chai latte is one of the best I've had and I keep swearing I am going to try more of their pastries but my booty begs me not to. I love Amelie's--more businesses should take after them"}
{"text":"Great hangout place with dangerous deserts and coffee. Be hip, hang out and get fat."}
{"text":"Best bakery in NC ! Gets really packed so seating is almost impossible. I always have to get mines to go. Best Creme Brûlée I've ever had! Beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Appearance: clean
Restrooms: clean
Service: great
Selection: fair --could be offering smaller sizes on all of their selections rather than just the popular few
Misc: real coffee cups & plates & plastic cutlery--pick one or the other please!
What i got: peach tart... peaches yummie & lightly glazed, not overly sweet... crust too hard to eat with plastic fork; cafe au'lait was perfect in every way!
Pricepoint:  $8.50 for the two items"}
{"text":"Amelie's has been one of my favorites for a long time! The salted caramel brownie is to die for, a must grab for any visit. The napoleon's are delicious, as well as their breakfast sandwiches. It has a quaint and cozy atmosphere, great for small meetings, first dates, & the perfect after dinner dessert spot."}
{"text":"This bakery is fresh and cute experience. You can watch them make pastries, enjoy a casual breakfast or lunch, have coffee, and relax in an eclectically modern French environment. Food delivery and coffee service is high tech efficient and fast."}
{"text":"There is no other place like Amelie's. Desserts are all fantastic and the savory food is great too! I just wish they had more milk options for drinks - they only have whole milk and almond milk, both of which are a little heavy for me. But still an awesome spot!"}
{"text":"I know I am going to get flack about this, but... I think Amelie's is over rated. The pastry is small and over priced. I think this is an example of growth diluting quality. When I first went, I was impressed. Good quality kitschy decor, embodiment of NODA. Now it's just average. I know that it is difficult to find a good bakery in Charlotte, but they have become \" just another place.\"
I'm just saying."}
{"text":"Having heard so much about it, and being a complete sugar-head, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good. 

But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets. 

I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused."}
{"text":"Okay.  I can't really say much to add to the description of the food.  Very decadent pastries, some pricier than others but overall not too gouging.  You've heard that already.
What I love here is the spirit of the place.  I've never seen a spot like it in Chitown, where social segregation is the order of the day.  I eat at Amelie's without minding the obnoxious hipsters.  Hipsters eat at Amelie's without minding the yuppies.  Yuppies eat at Amelie's without minding the guys who roll into the parking lot blasting rap music.  Rap music blasters eat at Amelie's without minding the squealing hyper college students who act like this is the first time they've been up past ten without their mom knowing (maybe its true).  And college students eat at Amelie's without minding the moms.
The place is not just a French bakery.  Its a perfectly nonjudgmental social utopia."}
{"text":"This place is great.  My favorite place in Charlotte.  There is a location easily reachable in Pineville-Mathews Rd. near Pineville.  It's really easy to find in a nice shopping center.  It's big and really nice inside.  Also has some alcoholic drinks.  Big crowd.  Great cappuccinos.  Pastries are completely beyond belief.  This place has such a good atmosphere, great clients, and an incredible place to hang out."}
{"text":"I've been to Amelie's several times, and though it is a bit of a calorie splurge, I've enjoyed it every time!  My husband and I have split the turkey croissant, the lemon raspberry tart (a favorite), the petite gateaux (so heavenly), and I've made any number of macaroons vanish without a crumb of proof! Their coffee is not my favorite, but (full disclosure here) the coffee is NOT why I go to Amelie's!  

I've also purchased birthday cakes here... SO amazingly done... I requested a large (cake-sized) version of the petite gateaux, and they were more than happy to oblige... great place to go anytime as they are always open! :D j'adore!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're on a diet. If you can walk out of the place with any less than 4 desserts, you're inhuman. And if you don't like desserts, the savory tarts are just as irresistible. My husband and I definitely got 5 desserts, including a macarons, mini tartes, and brownies, along with a whole baguette. Mid Saturday afternoon, the line was noticeable, but not oppressive - maybe 10 mins. I just wish you ordered *after* walking by the pastry case... I felt pretty pressured once finally up there since I had to browse and order simultaneously."}
{"text":"Chai tea- tasted watered down. 

Caramel brownie- always a wonderful choice. I love the caramel on the top the best. 

Apple Tart - decent, Pretty good

Elephant Ear- my friend liked it"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. The decor is cute! They are open 24/7 and it is a great location to study, hold a meeting, or kill time. I had their Napoleon and it was one of the best desserts I have ever had."}
{"text":"Good food but the absolute worst customer service I've ever seen.  Took 30 mins at 2pm to get a sandwich.  To give perspective lunch service is well over and there was barely anybody there. Folks were too busy talking to each other rather then running the register or expediting food as it hits the window.  If you go during lunch time good luck getting anything under an hour and half.  And that's to go."}
{"text":"24 hour coffee and French bakery. Why don't they have these everywhere? I love it.

The soy lattes are amazing, as are the pastries. I only visited twice a day while I was in Charlotte but I wish it could have been more. The bread pudding is great with coffee at 5 am.

Sure, the place is filled with hipsters but that is NoDa. Come at a quiet hour, like 4 or 5 in the morning, and enjoy great coffee and hip surroundings."}
{"text":"Amazing interior and the desserts are delicious although sometimes too sweet. I love the French inspired interior and the decorations. Great place to study or catch up with a friend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! One of the best bakeries I have ever visited! We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The line was quite long, but the employees had us placing our order in no time.
I decided to order the Croque Monsier while my fiancée went with the Roast Beef & Manchego with a cup of Asparagus soup. We also got dessert. I would recommend that you save yourself a lot of grief and just always plan on getting dessert when you go to Amelie's. It is worth the added calories, and they will gladly box it to go.
But I digress. The fiancée was pleased enough with her sandwich but admitted that she will order the Croque Monsier next time. Why? Because it was delicious! I got it on a croissant. The cheese was melty and the sauce was plentiful. Just a good sandwich. My regret: not ordering the soup! It was creamy and flavorful. I just hope they have it the next time as the soups are rotated.
For dessert I got the seasonal éclair which was filled with caramel cream. Oh my goodness! I could have eaten a dozen! I honestly can't remember the name of her dessert, but it was very rich and tasty.
This place is a must!"}
{"text":"I read recently that they were going to clone an Amelie's in the Hyde Park area of Tampa.  While I was back in Charlotte, I figured a quick visit to the original Mecca of the Carmel Salted Brownie was in order.  This way I could compare and contrast when I searched out the clone.

All is quite well with the original.  We shared a Turkey & Brie sandwich, a Brie & Apricot tartine, and the obligatory Carmel Salted Brownie.  We both left quite content.

I'll tell you about the Hyde Park clone soon......"}
{"text":"Another must do on my list when visiting Charlotte, NC, is stop in to one of the three Amelie's locations.  In January, my son and his girl friend took me to the one on N. Davidson Street.  I loved the whole look and feel of that place.

This new store is located in the Park Road Shopping Center with fairly good parking.  Also, I was happy to learn that it is only about 2 miles from my son's home.  The interior is done very nicely, but I think The Davidson location had more of an older, eclectic decor.   Although, it was very busy, the line moved quickly.  The staff was very friendly in spite of so many people coming in after church or stopping in for brunch.  We got our pastries and we're lucky enough to find an empty table inside.  There is a nice small patio  with seating, too. 

I choose a mixed berry fruit tart and hot chocolate for my beverage.  There was a bit of a wait for the beverages and coffees.  The staff did an awesome job keeping up with so many orders.  Everything I had was very good.  The sandwiches and salads of other customers looked delicious.  

I have no hesitation on returning here.  Great place."}
{"text":"We closed an evening out with a stop at this open all night bakery.   I couldn't believe how many people were waiting in line, but this had to be a good sign, right?  

The line moved very quickly just as the decisions on what to try had to be made fast.  There were 4 of us and together we purchased two vanilla eclairs, two coconut macaroons, chocolate cream puff and raspberry chocolate tart along with fresh brewed coffee.  I thought the prices were very reasonable considering the quality.  I was told the salted caramel brownies are very popular.  
The French bohemian decor with mismatched tables, chairs, and odd assortment of pictures on the walls adds to the vibe.  Definitely worth stopping in to give yourself a treat."}
{"text":"deserts was good and the food is better than Amys Baking Company"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite laces on Charlotte. The potato and leek soup is amazing especially when paired with the croque Monsieur! Open 24 hours a day...one of the only places in the area that does this which is a major plus if you're a night owl :) staff is friendly, all the food and desserts are good...simply put this place rocks"}
{"text":"Good food, but don't go there for lunch. Waited 30 minutes in line while employees stand around doing nothing when the could have  opened a third register. Not the place to go unless you want to go until they have more respect for people's time."}
{"text":"Best baguette in town. Oh how I love thee let me count the ways; 

24hrs, frozen take-home bread, the twice baked croissants, plenty of room(s), wi-fi, coffee, sandwiches, coolness obtained by being there, etc. 5*s for it being in Charlotte. 

3.5*s overall because the butter croissants are a little weak and the prices a little high, but it's worth it for that baguette...

{"text":"As a native of CLT, I can say I've visited multiple Amelie's locations, probably more than I'd care to admit & recommended it to many people over the years. I was ecstatic when they opened right across from my work in Uptown. Unfortunately, I have to say the quality of food & customer service at the this location has significantly declined. This morning was the fourth time in a row I was disappointed. My breakfast sandwich had the bare minimum of ingredients (so little cheese I actually had to check after a few bites) & also cold- it was not busy so not sure why. The other times I've visited lately, the sandwiches I had were subpar at best, one even had bacon that was pretty burnt- had to pick it off to eat. As far as customer service, the baristas are on their own time. After waiting 25 minutes the other night for a quick coffee, I had them change my order to tea & just ate the price difference, so I could just get a hot drink & go, as I had somewhere to be & couldn't continue to wait around. Perhaps they should focus on their job instead of chatting with other employees. This is not the quality I'm used to from Amelie's nor worth the price, which I hate to say. Amelie's, I'll always visit for your sweets but please work on maintaining the high quality of food & service that we've come to expect instead of expanding into new locations!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  So if you're looking for a quaint cafe with an ample supply of pastries and even French style sandwiches go here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Open 24/7

They have a great assortment of decedent desserts as well as sandwiches, soups, coffee, tea and more.


Their asparagus soup is to die for!

Their salted caramel brownie is amazing too!! 


Definitely make a trip here, it's well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We stood in line for a half hour on Saturday night and it was worth every minute.  I come here anytime I am in the vecinity because there is nothing like it. The Salted caramel brownie is shipped in from heaven and on the first bite, you will hear angels sing.  Their coffee is spectacular and the entire vibe is so eclectic and fun!  Also try the salted caramel torte and macaroons!

They are open 24 hours and so lines are better during off hours.  This is a MUST DO if you are anywhere near Charlotte.  There is nothing else quite like it."}
{"text":"A friend really wanted to go here for lunch while we were in town for a conference, and the biggest issue was finding the place.  We ended up going in through an office building, not realizing that the main entrance was around the corner.  I did appreciate the large roped-off area for the lines to order, with bakery and cafe split up, but at prime lunchtime, the cafe line was staffed by one cashier who, while nice, seemed new.  So the line moved veeeery slowly.  We also had some confusion about what to do with the buzzers, since it seemed like we were being told to stack them on some sort of thing on the table -- except that we didn't see anything like that outside.  Overall, very confusing.

I was pleasantly surprised at what seemed like pretty low prices, but as it turns out, the portion sizes are quite small.  My Provence BLT was on a croissant that was crumbling to pieces in my hands (over toasted, maybe) with approximately 2 pieces of bacon on it.  The seasonal truffle and thyme potato salad was decent, but could have used salt (I wasn't about to go look for it...), and all in all, $8 for lunch seemed a bit steep based on what I actually got.

However, the restaurant itself is quite large and very beautiful.  We enjoyed a perfect day to sit outside.  And, most impressively, I happened to be with a genuine Frenchman, who said that the pate was very good and the baguette tasted just like they do in France (rather than our US imitations, apparently).  So while I don't think I would go back for lunch, I have to give Amelie's the benefit of the doubt.  The desserts did look amazing, so maybe someday I'll be able to stop back for a pastry and coffee."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Charlotte area from New York. The first time I went to Amelie's was December of 2013 when I was in town for a show. 

I heard rave reviews about this place and had to check it out. I wasn't disappointed then, and I haven't been disappointed each time I've been back!

The pastries are incredible. They make things on site, and the egg sandwiches on a freshly made croissant are beyond delicious. 

It has a comfortable vibe, and everyone who works there is really friendly and pleasant. 

Do yourself a favor. If you're near Charlotte... GET TO AMELIE'S!

P.S. They are open 24/7. Yep. Great food and drinks day or night!"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts & impeccable coffee with a cute set up.  I will definitely be back, hopefully before we leave town just to pick up more macaroons.  The grapefruit is where it's at & the goat cheese is running up behind it."}
{"text":"Cashiers il est mauvais. They are sarcastic short tempered. I am eating a dirt ridden sandwich. It is cold because the person that made my drink let stand there until both were cold. The pastries did look good. I would return to this place, but nah I probably will not. Au revoir!"}
{"text":"So... what can you say about the best place on Earth that a bunch of others haven't said?

I'm not that good at making up niceties, so... 

Love this place! 

How's that?"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and snacks!!..... Plus the ambience looks very good. Would definitely visit again.

{"text":"I've been here a few times because my girlfriend absolutely loves it. I guess I'm just not a fan of french baked goods or whatever because I've yet to be blown away by anything I've tried so far. I have ordered a variety of things and haven't been impressed with any of it. I seriously think that maybe I just don't like french cuisine due to the ENORMOUS amount of people that love this place. 

It's always packed to the gills and that's saying a lot because the establishment is huge. I do enjoy the way it's laid out and decorated. Very artistic and mellow. It reminds me of an on-campus college eatery of sorts. It also attracts a lot of early twenty somethings and of course when that happens, I think it's pretentious and overrated because I hate conformity. Maybe that's why I'm lonely. I go here to sip a cup of coffee and glance from behind my teacup at the potential friendships I may develop, only to realize I'm a disappointment in everything I do and that no one will ever truly understand or love me. So I choke down the sandwiches of hard bread. I apathetically chew the crescent roll pastries until I grow bored with it, half eaten, growing more and more stale by the second. Stale like this life I've sluggishly and lethargically meandered along, awaiting for my hope and faith in humanity to renew. Envious of all those smiling and content faces that reflect success and happiness. They get what they want and they love it here, but it makes me depressed. Won't someone give me a hug? I mean, is it the beard? Should I shave it off? I like my beard though. I guess I'll have to settle on me liking the little things about myself since no one else like anything about me. Even my girlfriend settled on me. It's becoming more obvious every time she just nods at my attempt at humor, unsmiling, eyes screaming out for help too, in hopes that some 24 year old Vespa driving French man, or woman even, thanks to me, will come rescue her from this life with me that she never in a hundred years would have envisioned when our romance was still fresh. It too has grown stale.  

So yeah, that sums up how I feel about this place.

UPDATE: Since the customer service woman of Amélie's gave me an internet hug, I feel the need to update my rating from two stars to three. This place, and my life, are A-OK now. I see the sun shining through the clouds and my girlfriend set up a ménage à  trois with her new French girlfriend and I, which by the way has been surprisingly nice so far... she's a real sweetheart... so all is well."}
{"text":"Great spot!! You can find your own nook area here and enjoy some good wine, beer, coffee, tea, soups, sandwiches, and decedent desserts.

I usually get the..

·Asparagus leak soup- usually amazing! Only ok tonight.

·Open faced crescent w melted cheddar cheese- very good!!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is great!  I have been here so many times and am always willing to make the drive to get my sweet fix.  I have loved everything I've tried, with the salted caramel brownie being the only exception that sticks out.  For some reason it just didn't do it for me- I think it was just way too dense and sweet.  I love the eclairs, the little mini pie thing with raspberries on top (I'm not quite fancy enough to know the official name) and the apple turnovers.  Their drinks are good too- I usually go with the chai tea or the lemonade.  

I have really only been at nighttime, but it is always crowded and hard to find a seat.  I agree with a poster below- they could take out some of the eclectic decorations and make room for more seating inside.  I'm not a big fan of the atrium because it gets so loud and stuffy but it'll do in desperate times.  

This is a great place to catch up with friends, get some work done (as long as you have headphones) or grab and go!"}
{"text":"I would definitely return to Amelie's if I visited Charlotte again. I live in Michigan and it's very difficult to find traditional french macarons. I was really happy to see varying flavors of them offered at Amelie's, even if they weren't AMAZING, at least they were there for me to enjoy. 

The cream cheese pocket was delicious but the highlight was the salted caramel brownie. Oh god. Last meal wish: salted caramel brownies. Lots of them. 

The mini pecan pie was good, too."}
{"text":"I kid you not...I stood I line for about a half-hour at 10pm on a Thursday to get a salted caramel brownie.  Know what?  I would do it again!  That brownie may well have been been the best brownie I've ever purchased.  Creamy, gooey caramel atop a brownie cooked to exactly medium-well done such that it was also slightly gooey without being mushy.  Add in just enough salt that you get the texture of a large-grain salt but not so much as to make the thing too salty.

Bliss for $2.49 a piece.  Wow!"}
{"text":"I stop here every time I visit Charlotte. This location is usually pretty crowded, but the line moves really quickly and the staff is attentive and friendly. 

On today's visit I got an iced coffee that was delicious and an assortment of pastries. The eclairs were large and delicious, as was the croissant. I would definitely recommend stopping in for a quick bite to eat, but seating can be difficult to find during peak hours."}
{"text":"It's Amelie's its FRENCH it's a Bakery so why not 5 stars you ask? Well maybe if I hadn't experienced the Noda location this would've been an easy 5star review however knowing that the customer service, the taste of the pastries, the crowd, the hours are all better in Noda I have to take the star-rage down on this one.

The pros: Conveniently located for me and my family 
Quick French Fix (pastry)
Very easy on the eyes 

The cons: The cost
Hours 
Taste 
Variety at all hours 

I could go on and on but I won't, I like Amelie's and will return to this one when convenient but if I had to choose and time isn't an option I will head to Noda especially since I can go any time of day or night and get a sweet fix as they are 24hr.

The people working here are nice (not as nice as Noda staff) but definitely friendly with good customer service."}
{"text":"Great lunch for four plus pastries. Croissant sandwiches fresh, big, and good. Bean salad side excellent. Macarons perfect. Fair prices for lunch. Pastries pricey but excellent. Good place for quick lunch in nice casual atmosphere. Will return."}
{"text":"While checking my Yelp app, I was excited to find that there was a new Amelie's location outside of NoDa, not far from where we were.  After dinner, we stopped by for dessert (at 7 p.m.).  We found the new Amelie's at the end of the strip mall plaza and, upon entering, loved that they recreated the look of the NoDa location and had plenty of seating.  

We walked up to the counter to view the pastry cases.  They looked a little bare boned, not what we're used to at the Amelie's in NoDa.  We inquired about the chocolate croissants.  We were informed that they were out of them (as we could see in the empty case) and that the best time to get pastries is in the mornings.  Huh.  Frustrated, we just left, dessertless.  The cases at the NoDa location ALWAYS seem full of EVERY dessert whenever we've stopped by, no matter what time of day it was.  So now we have to base our dessert options on when we come?  No thanks.  I don't just want leftovers.  Fail."}
{"text":"Love this place. We tried tons of sweets, but our favorites were salted caramel brownie, pecan tart and lemon raspberry tart. Skip the twice baked almond croissant and the regular croissants.  Even though the salted caramel macaron previously was my favorite thing I'd ever eaten, this time there was no salt flavor so it was a little boring. 

The latte of the day (I think it was St. Laurent  Spice) was amazing."}
{"text":"Very decent for the area. Nothing like this around. Very expensive. Was cool for a few weeks. Now it's nothing special to me. But if you have no tried it. Give the place a shot."}
{"text":"I ADORE Amelie's and may or may not go there WAY too often!  Every treat I have gotten is delicious and you better believe I've eaten my fair share of salted caramel brownies, their coffee drinks are delicious, their tea is super fresh and again, delicious! I cannot day enough good things about Amelie's, the staff is wonderful, the management even better and the atmosphere is welcoming, inclusive and great for hanging out with friends, having a business meeting or even studying! Can't wait to go back, see y'all tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Sweetness of every bite! The new location of Amelie's includes salted caramel brownies and all the goodness of this French bakery. I am a true fan of Amelie's and the eccentric decorations delighted me. They have a macaron chandelier!  One of 42
chandeliers hanging there in the restaurant. 
And I love the chai drinks with almond milk.

They face the back side of Park Rd shopping center by the garden store from Blackhawk and across from Midwood. There's plenty of parking in the back lot.  The entrance is down the stairs like a basement but it's like a fun East Village vibe. The patio looks cozy when it's cool in the fall. Happy to have another respite in Amelie's world!"}
{"text":"Lovely new cafe! I enjoy Amelie's in Noda but so happy to have a French cafe down south. I adore the salted caramel brownies and macaroons. Had the turkey and bacon sandwich which was delicious and they even switched the cheese because I asked. My friend had granola/yogurt which she enjoyed. The macaroons are divine!! I tried passion fruit and berry. The lavender is another favorite. Like the plethora of tables and my advice is go early for lunch."}
{"text":"Hip, roomy, food is good I like the yogurt, great place to chill and hangout with friends and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about Amelie's. I fell in love with their NODA location many years ago, and always make a point to visit when I'm in town. While this downtown location doesn't have the charming hominess of the NODA location, that's ok with me. It more than makes up for it in the fact that the line moves quicker, there's was more seating, and just tons of space in general! Plus, the location is right downtown, mere steps from the hotel I always stay in while I'm in Charlotte.

We went one evening (great, long hours, by the way!) and got macarons, a salted caramel bar, and an amazing thing called a creme brulee soda. We went back the next morning for yogurt and granola, swoon-worthy breakfast sandwich on a croissant, and an espresso soda drink. 

The variety is astounding, the staff is always perky and helpful. I just wish the labeled their macaron flavors so I didn't have to constantly ask their staff to tell me which is which."}
{"text":"Paris on Park! Great coffees with exceptional pastries and othe flavorable fresh sweet options.  Clean, fun and great service."}
{"text":"Gilded. pretty on the outside, bland and cardboard on the inside. I'm talking w out their pastries here."}
{"text":"A cozy place for desserts and lunch. Nice selection of French desserts. I especially love their fruit tart and almond tea cakes. They just need to improve their logistics. Service can be very slow during busy times."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but that's pretty much it. Amelie's claims to be a French bakery but nothing about it is French. The food is named like foods you'd get in France but doesn't look/taste anything like it."}
{"text":"We We and all that jazz..
I've never been to this place before and very excited to have been introduced by my neighbor while heading out to dinner. I usually grab a tart while in WholeFood and I've always thought they were perfect in flavor. Welllll I was WRONG and I'm NEVER WRONG ;-)
I had a tart which by the way was super TINY and quite pricey that had soooo much FLAVOR it was crazy. It was just a bite and when I say bite I mean bite (see photo). I don't give many 5 star reviews as it take a lot to impress me as a place has to be great from start to finish and Amelia's didn't disappoint as the staff was kind, welcoming and generous. I also grabbed a crescent and a roll of bread to go. Each were extremely fresh and awesome when consumed the next day.
The fact that this place is 24 hours is a TRUE SCORE as I'll be back REALLY SOON Ya Hear"}
{"text":"Such a unique little cafe (it's actually quite spacious) with a choice of counter seating, or if you prefer a cozy sofa to curl up in front of a faux fireplace, or perhaps you like a more face to face encounter, then take your seats at a cafe table and sit in a pair of lucite chairs...wherever you choose to sit, amaze yourself with all the lovely and quirky decor, from crystal chandeliers to funky Mona Lisa paintings, mini Eiffel Tower models, an upside tree growing from the ceiling, and so much more...it's totally a date spot...hangout, and they even have a private party area on the upper level...the sweet delicacies taste amazing and the coffees are just as wonderful...the service is also just as fabulous! 
We only come down to Charlotte on business 2x a year, but this newly opened establishment will definitely be on our to do list for every future trip...You must stop in, it's like an art gallery you can sit and eat in, and just relax and enjoy the amazing atmosphere that Amelie's has created..."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a unique place among all of the fast food and chain stores here in Charlotte. The original location in NoDa is the best, but the parking and the lines can be pretty rough there no matter the time or day. Definitely a must see. Their lavender lemonade and chocolate hazelnut tart are among my favorites."}
{"text":"You have not done your bucket list unless you savor the bakery of Amelie's"}
{"text":"Love this bakery! Wonderful pastries and open 24 hours. Lines can get long late night, but the salted caramel brownies and coffee makes it worth it"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bakery/coffee house in town. I love it! It's so cutely decorated inside, and all the food and pastries look so yummy. Really good vibe. I recommend the lavender lemonade!"}
{"text":"This bakery is the best ever!! Such amazing authentic french treats! The macaroons are to die for! I have never been when there is not a line. I also love that they are open 24hrs, i mean late night cravings satisfied, am i right? The people are always so nice and the atmosphere is great too! Love love this this place! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Lovely and amazing desserts! I adore the salted carmel brownie for true chocolate lovers.  The macarons are light and sugary fluffy bits of dessert heaven.  I like their sandwiches, croissants, quiches, salads, teas with flavor of the day, coffee (and they have almond milk for us lactose intolerant peeps). I cannot think of one thing I do not love to eat on their menu. I enjoy the quirky decorations too. And after visiting Paris, I can say their desserts definitely live up to the inspiration!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is the perfect place to spend time day or night. The ambiance is sheer perfection and the pastries are delish. The menu is simple yet tasty and the fact that they are open 24 hours is a plus. They have free WiFi and it reminds me of Paris because you can sit at a table as long as you like and no one is going to rush you. It's one of those places that I bring people to who are visiting the city and a place I frequent even when I don't have company. It's simply divine."}
{"text":"Um, perfect. I didn't know that Charlotte had a place like this. I never met a baked good I didn't like, but Amelie's was still way beyond my greatest expectations. I limited my goodies to a coconut macaroon and an apple turnover but will be back for one of the fruit tart things that I didn't have time for.

I would live on pastries if I could, but I needed the sustenance of a sandwich too. Any restaurant offering multiple forms of brie is obviously perfect, so I trusted them with something a little adventurous: brie, turkey, and cranberry relish. My trust was well placed. I will be back next week."}
{"text":"Total disappointment. Lines are insanely long. Bar is a mess. 12:15 and they are out of everything. Only two registers open and it is at least a 30 minute wait in line. Shame on you. Horrible Father's Day morning"}
{"text":"The dessert is fine... But closed at 9pm and all you sell is dessert? ... Not happy. They let me in before they shut the doors, but wouldn't sell me an espresso because the machine is off... Why would you shut down the coffee at a dessert bar? So I asked for a glass of wine... Nope sorry, out of it.... Really? Next time either come early, which means earlier dinner reservations, or just go elsewhere... Maybe NoDa, where it's open 24hr.. Their hours and service are much better... This place needs time, but it carries an elite name? Poor franchise..."}
{"text":"Kudos to Amélie's for furnishing their bakery with purchases from the Habitat Restore. I ordered chocolate bread pudding and it came out simultaneously burnt and cold - the outside was charred and the inside was cold. From the little that I tasted I could tell that actually reheating it properly wouldn't make it much better. Employee kindly gave me a refund. My boyfriend enjoyed his chocolate croissant but I didn't care for his chocolate cake/mousse dessert. Would come back to try lunch sandwiches and a salted caramel brownie."}
{"text":"Love getting dessert here! My favorite is the Salted Caramel Brownie! Really though, everything I've eaten here is delicious!"}
{"text":"In college this was my number one study spot. Beautiful atmosphere, great pastries and treats and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the most interesting, eclectic decor! It's fun to look around and spot cool stuff. The menu is simple, their soups and quiches of the day haven't changed the 5-6 times that I've been here. The potato leek soup is good, it's different because it's not pureed like I'm used to. Their seasonal tartine is good but couldn't really taste the potato puree but you could taste the truffle. The roast beef and manchego has a good amount of beef in it and is pretty tasty! 
Chicken salad croissant isn't the classic chicken salad because it has big chunks of chicken in it but is a good option nonetheless!
The chocolat chaud is basically hot chocolate but not sickly sweet and I really enjoyed it!!
The chocolate croissants are good, but I've had nicer ones. The salted caramel bar is delicious and the espresso gateaux is superb if you wait for it to warm up to room temperature to enjoy the buttercream!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Better macaroons than Laudreé, no question.  Amazing, all around: pastries, coffee, atmosphere.  I can't believe a place this incredible is in Charlotte.  And the customer service was absolutely wonderful too!!!!  They went way above and beyond."}
{"text":"After our latest trip to France, my wife and I so enjoy all manner of French cuisine, but most of all, the pastries.  And among those, we prefer the kind that can be enjoyed in the afternoon with a nice cup of tea or coffee.  We found exactly what we were looking for at Amélie's.  With a  wonderful atmosphere that is conducive to conversation, Amélie's is an art-filled spot on the edge of the NoDa neighborhood that makes us want to return.  The petit gâteau was perfect and the macarons we excellent!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I must admit, my first time here, I was like \"eh?\" That said, my next 10 or so visits have been so much better. I think I ordered the wrong item the first time...probably a diet water or something...can't remember...don't care. I will say that all visits since have been with my wife and she knows how to order treats, so based on her advice I have found many favorites. I also enjoy sitting in the large back area and check out the free wi-fi and relax with some coffee and treats. A few treats are a little high priced for me, but then again, I'm not eating them daily. Anything peanut butter is tops with me, but the cream cheese puff is also a winner for me.

This place is cool, the staff is cool and the food is even cooler! Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars because of the love that the people in Charlotte have for this place but I'm from New Orleans and I have a very high standard taste for French bakery and this place doesn't really fit my taste, and it is way overpriced but Great place to hang out and drink coffee and meet new people"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to go anytime during the day or night!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd Amelie's venture outside of their original NODA location.  The first (Pineville Matthews Rd) wasn't that great.  This time I visited their \"new\" College St location in Uptown Charlotte.  It, too, had its disappointments.  While the interior was fantasticly designed, the lines to order aren't so fantasticly designed.  I also think they need to hire additional staff (or reassign them during shifts.)  

Only two cash registers were open.  We stood in a relatively short (5-6) people line for about 20 minutes just to get a frickin' chocolate croissant. There were two (bored) employees behind the pastry counter because everyone was ordering food and drinks other than pastries. After 10 minutes, I finally got up to the pastry counter and ordered my chocolate croissant from the sparse pastry display case (it was only about noonish).  I then had to wait another 10 minutes -- croissant in hand -- to pay for it.  As we were (finally) walking away with the croissant, one of the cashiers (mind you, there's only two) ran across the room saying she'd be right back. 

A lot of tables were empty, yet most of these empty tables were dirty.  (Here's an idea: how about sending one of the bored pastry people out on a quick run to wipe down tables?  Or adding additional staff?) 

Where's the management for this establishment?  It doesn't seem like it's managed very well to provide top quality, efficient service.  

While the croissant was good, was it worth standing in line for 20 minutes and sitting at a semi-dirty table?  Um...no."}
{"text":"I haven't had any of their sandwiches here just yet but the pastries are amazing. Also, the atmosphere is kinda a little on the \"hipster-coffee house\" side which usually can make a place feel a little too pretentious for my liking but I still find it comfortable there. The staff is very helpful and I'm looking forward to being able to make it by there for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Everything French and what you would expect from a French restaurant in France. Everything inside was very beautiful and quant. The deserts are to die for. Very decedent and scrumptious. Prices range based on the food you get but it's similar in price to Star B. However the atmosphere is completely different and you need to experience it for yourself. It's on our list of places we take our friends and family to experience when they come to visit us in SC. They have multiple locations all are respectable establishments."}
{"text":"I've been living in Charlotte for almost three years and never reviewed this place until now.

I will say that you must visit this place! It's rare to find a spot to bring your laptop and eat savory sweets so peacefully at 3 am. Not sure if the Waffle House counts ;) Not only is the food awesome, but the interior is great too. Definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"I visited Charlotte recently and quickly became obsessed with the breakfast sandwiches at Amelie's."}
{"text":"I think I died an went to heaven the day I had my first Amelie's salted caramel nut brownie. The quiche is always delicious as well as the sandwiches. Must try the dirty chi. The best in town!"}
{"text":"Elegant looking coffee place..they have a awesome collection of pastries and other foods. Their mocha is to die for. Love this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"BAKERY and ATMOSPHERE:
The pistachio macaroon is phenomenal! The atmosphere here is quiet, good for studying in secluded areas, catching up with friends, or just hanging out to read. There are many nooks and crannies of hidden seating areas, which I thought was very cool. They have a unique decor French theme with lights, antique looking furniture, paintings, and odd-Frenchy decorations. Definitely stop by for a pastry--you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love that this place is open 24/7.  Being from the city and a college town I was use to going to places late at night to get some work done if I needed to.  Now that I'm in Charlotte 24/7 restaurant or coffee shops has been much harder to find until I came across Amelie's.  Every time I've ordered here the staff has been very friendly.  I've also never been disappointed by the food that I've been served here."}
{"text":"Fantastic pastries and drinks with a phenomenal atmosphere in a great artsy district of Charlotte. A bit pricey and not worth the hour long wait you may catch on a weekend evening. I do recommend the salted caramel brownie if it is your first time. Simply delicious"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE FOR A INTERVIEW. Every time I go to Amelie's, I think, if I were being interviewed, I'd like to be interviewed here. It looks like a place you'd interview a person at. But I digress. The coffee is good and the pastries are great. there is always a line, even at 3 in the morning. Yes it is a 24 hour place. Seating will be hard to find, especially with a larger group."}
{"text":"GREAT BAKERY. Love the baked goods. Wasn't impressed by the coffee drinks. I've been here several times and I will say that the coffee, no matter a latte, cap, or a drip cup, has never wowed me."}
{"text":"What a fun spot!  We are in Charlotte for a family function and found this spot while wandering around the city.  The food, coffee, staff, and vibe here are wonderful.  I wish we were going to be in town longer, as this would be a daily spot!"}
{"text":"There are not many really great bakeries around here! But, this place is a gem! I don't live too close but it is certainly worth the drive! They have some really delicious pastries! I absolutely recommend this place to everyone who loves fresh, high quality, delicious baked goods!"}
{"text":"I went to Amelie's twice on my trip to Charlotte and enjoyed it immensely! A great place to grab a yummy bite or relax and rest your feet."}
{"text":"The drip coffee is pretty good. The chia latte is wonderful according to my wife. The salted caramel brownie is terrific. The attitude we received when we ordered SUCKED! :( My coffee was a 1/4 empty. 

I asked for it to be topped off and the snotty girl still didn't fill it up. If it were gas station coffee and were cheap it would not be a big deal. However when you drop over $15 and you're treated like your inconviencing an employee it's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Love this spot. It gets overcrowded from time to time but I love the atmosphere. Love the food and pastries."}
{"text":"Love Amelies!! The Noda location is great!! The other locations are not a good. I always get the salted caramel brownie and lavender lemonade. Whenever I have guests in town, I always take them there. It is a perfect place to sip coffee and spend time with friends. Seriously love Amelies"}
{"text":"DOES ANYONE JUST WANT COFFEE?!

How many times can you scream that at a line of people before someone jabs you in the eye?  Really?  Just help everyone in line patiently and with the best humor you can muster.  (No one ever did just want coffee and she never did help anyone who wanted anything else)

Besides that annoyance and the extremely long line itself, there was also the demand that we get in line when my mother and I were just trying to look at the menu board, and the young man who huffed and said \"That's nice, now what do you want\" when I explained we hadn't been to the property before and hadn't had a chance to look at the board.  We were rushed through start to finish.

The only saving grace was that the cakes were good.  Not good enough to make up for that, though.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so relaxing, we just walked around the surprisingly large building in awe.  The decor is beautiful and the pastries look even better!

I had a raspberry peach muffin and chocolate croissant with a strawberry something limonade.  The food was delicious but the drink was a little much for me.  My husband got a BLT on a baguette and it was really good!

Absolutely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype!  

Me:
Salted caramel brownie-yeah, just do it.  Unreal.
Roasted veggie salad-nice side salad with fresh roasted veggies and a delicious feta dressing.  My body needed greens and it hit the spot.
Half Mushroom Tartine-Favorite thing I ate.  Delicious mushrooms covered in melted cheese on crusty buttered bread.

Husband had a roast beef and cheese sandwich on a croissant.  It was absolutely delicious and the croissant was perfectly flaky and buttery.

We will return. What a great little spot!!"}
{"text":"Coffee and pastries are always FRESH!!! Trust me once you they're\"Melange\" or \"Madison\" brewed coffee, you'll be BACK!! They offer much more...."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. It is one of the first places I ever went to when I moved to Charlotte and I still get excited every time I go. Being a student when I first moved, I spent maaaaany 24 hour periods at Amelie's and we got very well acquainted. 

I have probably tried almost every deliciously amazing treat they serve. Their sandwiches have always been on point and I, of course, love the salted caramel brownie, macarons, chocolate croissants, and my serious obsession - the eclair. I went through a really unhealthy two weeks of eating two eclairs a day because I was so obsessed and they are THAT good. To my excitement, they opened a small little express Amelie's uptown and one treat they always have are the eclairs - thank goodness!!

The decor is fun, there is plenty of seating, the people watching is great, and the coffee and treats are fantastic. I think its almost impossible to not walk out without a smile on your face, maybe a sugar coma too, but it's worth it. 
Only catch is that on a weekend night, expect to wait in a serious line, as its clearly always the place to be!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for one night and we needed a place to grab breakfast before we got back on the road. This place was by the hotel and we saw it the night before so we decided to try it. In glad we did. 

The ordering can get a bit confusing, they weren't overly friendly, but not bad, and they didn't have crepes, even though it was on the menu board. Those are my reasons for not giving 5 stars. 

The pros: the blueberry cream cheese muffin was probably the best one I've ever had! It was perfectly moist and flavorful. I ate more of it than my son did because I couldn't help myself!

I had the quiche which was perfectly flakey and delicious

My husband got a sandwich of some sort, o don't remember what it was but he loved it. 

I also got a chocolate croissant, mmmmm I could use another one right now."}
{"text":"This is truly an amazing place. The desserts are always done well, the atmosphere is jovial and friendly, and the drinks are always done right. For all those trans folk out there, they ARE trans-friendly when it comes to bathroom usage!

I personally enjoy the lattes and macarons. If you get a latte, it usually pairs really well with their chocolate or vanilla macarons. I would definitely reccomend trying them together!

Another great dish is the pecan pie. It's a classic southern dish, but it is executed so beautifully. The pastry is done just right and both crumbles and melts in your mouth. This continues to be a favourite in my family."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte!! I just love everything abt Amelie's! Everytime I have a friend in town visiting we come here. The decor is eclectic & semi-Paris themed. Really fun. Open 24/7 & alway busy. I recommend not going weekend evenings because you will wait in line. The asparagus soup is great but I mostly just get dessert when I go. Coconut macaroons are great. Salted caramel brownies are heavenly. There are tiny chocolate cups w/ different fillings. The passion fruit is out of this world. Not to be confused with the chocolate passion fruit tho."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch or a nice way to end a date night. Lots of seating options and the decor really can't be beat.

The only thing I'd like to see is more vegetarian and vegan options or that the vegan desserts were clearly marked."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Waited 25 min and still they couldn't get me an iced tea! I mean it's just an ICED tea. Even after I tell them after 20 min they still didn't get the iced tea wtf is wrong with these people"}
{"text":"This is a great find.  I had a late lunch here and returned for coffee and quiche in the morning.  Everything was very good.  I agree with other reviews, too.  The coffee and bread were exceptional. I didn't realize they are open 24/7, but that's good to know for the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am obsessed! My coworkers showed me this placed a few months ago and now I have to come here at least once or twice a month! I love their seasonal coffees. My favorite item on the menu is the tomato, spinach and mozzarella quiche. I ask for my quiche to be heated twice only because sometimes once just isn't enough (I've gotten it cold a few times and I hate taking food back. It makes me feel like I'm wasting it.).  But nonetheless, it's still very yummy!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in the mood for delicious, fresh made, french pastries of all kinds come here. They have multiple locations in the greater Charlotte area (though I've personally only been here and the NoDa location) and I have never been disappointed. The Chocolate Petite Gateux is my favorite but the Macarons and Salted Caramel Brownies are also splendid."}
{"text":"The turkey and brie was amazing with their home made asparagus and bean soup! Yummm"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! A lot of pastries to choose from. Could use some more sandwich/ other options. I had a turkey and Brie sandwich which was delicious! But there were not may other non sweet treats to choose from. A great date spot or meet up w a friend"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bakeries on clt. It has such a hippie vibe to it and it's always crowded but the pastries are so worth the long line. I usually try to get in before 6 pm otherwise the line wraps the whole store. 

I love the napoleons! They are my favorite. The macarons are okay too, a bit pricey but to try doesn't hurt. Everything is sweet but not so overly sweet. 

A great little place to study with friends and enjoy the day just socializing while having sweet treats."}
{"text":"I live in NODA and don't make it over here a lot, but when I do it's pretty good!! 

I do tend to get the same things but they work for me!! I typically order a cup of the soup *please note Im a huge soup lover!!! I can eat soup on the hottest day of the year i just LOVE it!!  last two times I was in it was a potato leek with asparagus ( 95% sure) very good both times. I also have the Roast Beef with Borsin cheese on a baguette, my FAV!! I just want the option of having it to be bigger :) just a suggestion!! 

I'm not even going to try to start to name all of the pastries I've had from here, because it has been a lot!! All I can tell you is that almost all are great!! Some are not my favorite but you weed them out and find the ones you love!! 

In the future I'm going to try and make more of an effort to come here!! PS not sure if y'all heard but they are opening one in uptown across from The Green!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the eclair.  It was amazing.  And the people working here are just as amazing.  Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Have always loved Amelie's, but it was not convenient. Now at Park Road Shopping Center, it has become a favorite for us meeting our daughters for breakfast! Yummy foods, amazing coffees and pastries to die for! Once you stand in line and order, you get table service. Be informed that ordering pastries uses the same line as ordering a sandwich, so unless you are ordering pastries, move ahead to the cash register to order your sandwich. Love seeing the funky, artsy decor! Great energy in this open, fun place!"}
{"text":"This has become a family favorite, just down the street from us. Yummy food, the best coffee drinks and the decor is so cool! We end up just hanging around for a good while and feel very welcome to do so. We go the one at Park Road Shopping Center in the back lot. So happy that they came to our area!"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure I just stared open mouthed for about 5 minutes while trying to decide what to get.  And I may have even drooled a little bit... no judging... but eventually made up my mind and ordered... 4 bakery items.  Everything looks absolutely delicious in their lit up display cases and choosing is extremely difficult!

Amelie's has a plethora of items to select from but their Palmiers were my absolute favorite thing!  Deliciously crunchy, sweet, and flaky! 

Lovely eclectic french interior with lots of seating areas ranging from comfy cozy to large tables for working with groups.  

I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the bakery is awesome. When you walk in, it's very visually stimulating with the french yet eclectic, fun decor. The pastries look delicious and they have a wide range of macarons, tarts, cakes, etc. The price point is very high for these pastries though. Some of the pastries do not have prices, so you have to ask before you buy. Overall, the vibe is really chill and would be a fun and relaxing place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery! Tucked away in a little NoDa shopping center. Cool atmosphere inside and you feel like you could hang out here all day. Coffee and tea are great and they can make anything iced for you. In fact, the people working there are super nice and friendly. Huge assortment of pastries and they're as delicious as they look! Raleigh needs an Amelie's ASAP!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute eclectic cafe! The food is amazing and they offer a wide variety of morning drinks to get your day started. If it's nice enough outside, you should sit on their patio. They even have a small love lock section. You can put your lock out there symbolizing your love towards your significant other! Such a cute idea. If you're in the area this is definitely a great spot to enjoy breakfast."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out this location and I loved it! It was spacious and the staff was so friendly! 

I went for a chocolate croissant...but somehow ended up with a few more goodies in my box. Everything was absolutely delicious! 

I'm sure I'll be back soon for some more goodies!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Dropped in because we were visiting and this place came highly recommended...Tried the French Press, which was okay, Lavender macaroons were pretty tasty. Just a little disappointed there were no more coconut macaroons am a big fan of anything with coconut! Service was acceptable."}
{"text":"Aaaahhhh, Amelie's.  There is no other place in Charlotte that reminds me more of home (NYC) than Amelie's.  It has an old-school East Village flair with bohemian decor and fabulous pastries.  The line is out the door most times I go, and I always plan on waiting for at least 10 minutes before I can place my order.  They even have some gluten free options!  Coffee is good, and service is pretty fast considering there's always a ton of people there.  When I am in the 'hood, we always stop for some pastries.  Definitely recommended, if you don't mind crowds and waiting a bit."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. First off, the decor just makes you smile, inside and out. Unique and original. Check out the tree in the corner that's hanging upside down from the ceiling. Coolness.

5 stars - Paris blend iced tea with vanilla syrup added, just lightly sweetened. The tea is brewed on the spot. This tea blend came recommended from one of the staff members. Spot on flavor and the aroma was a terrific balance of floral and bold. 

5 stars - Butter croissant. It was so good I came back two days in a row just for that croissant. It's crispy on the outside and flaky soft on the inside. Just what you'd want. And a treat because it was a generous size for a bakery croissant. 

Paris tea and a butter croissant please. That'll be what I order when I come back. Then I'll find a seat under that tree to soak in the ambience."}
{"text":"Pros: 

lots of comfortable seating areas 
Wide selection of pastries to choose from (and nothing looked stale or old)
Knowledgeable staff of explaining their product
Constant people coming in during a Saturday PM
24h operation 

Cons:

Can't execute a cappuccino properly
Does French coffee always have to be strong? 
 Priced as if you were back in Chelsea. NoDA has a long way to go still

Result:

I'll come back for the comfortable couch, a Coffee brought from somewhere else and likely get anything that involves cream for a pastry. What was surprisingly good was the brownies...."}
{"text":"Delicious for lunch and excellent for dessert.
Atmosphere is unique. Lots of interesting maps, painting, chotchkies.
Would suggest the salted carmel brownie to anyone."}
{"text":"Their salted caramel brownies are delicious and you must try their macaroons. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  They also have a good variety of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot!  Raspberry Tart was to die for!!!! Fig, bacon and Brie Tratine was also excellent.  Also sampled other pastries all were spot on!

Cool funky little spot!!! 

Staff was super helpful bending to my picky kids and making them happy. 

Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Delicious, quaint, and so friendly! Multiple people told us we had to come here while in Charlotte. Well worth the trip to NoDa."}
{"text":"A french bakery open 24/7, what a niche filler in Charlotte.  We are lacking sooooo much in super late night eats and love that you can always count on these guys to be there.

Get the caramel brownie.  There I said it.  You'll thank me later, but lets just get that out of the way.  What else you may want is up to you.  Plenty of soup, tartines, and sandwich options.  The soups change daily, so I can't really recommend any one in particular.  As far as the sandwiches go though, I'm a turkey and brie on baguette fan.  The roast beef and manchego is worth a try as well, and a great dipper in a french onion soup.

After you've ordered, take a look around.  If you go around to your left, there is a large open area with multiple seating options.  You can normally count on someone studying back there.  The atrium out back also has plenty of seating options and is quite a change of pace for Charlotte dining.  Wherever you sit, don't forget to bring your diner number with ya.  It can take a while to get your food otherwise.

Disclaimer:  Its normally after 2am when I eat here, so the food could easily be close to 3.5-4.5 stars and my munchies are just taking over.  Regardless, its still a great option for the late night."}
{"text":"I love Amelies! This is my go to coffee shop in Charlotte! They have great drinks (coffee and cold beverages like french sodas) as well as amazing deserts! Their Chocolate Mousse is amazing, their French Macaroons are great, if you like sweets you will not be let down. Their breakfast dishes are also yummy. The decor at Amelies is also really crazy and awesome! Lots of space to sit down and enjoy your food/drinks and relax."}
{"text":"I love Amelies! They have the best sweets and French sodas ever! I love their French Macarons, they always have the best flavors of them! They hAve a great selection of breakfast and lunch foods as well! Really fun atmosphere also, the sitting areas are so fun to look at!"}
{"text":"What a unique and awesome place!!! Desserts are incredibly delicious. We ordered a Layered Torte
Chocolate, Salted Caramel and Seasonal along with a Salted Caramel Brownie Café Mocha... amazing! Ambiance is quite and tranquil. Great place to head too after dinner in or around Uptown."}
{"text":"I've been going for that past 4 years, I go so much they follow me on Instagram lol. Always a delight to stop by for some pie !"}
{"text":"So delicious!, I ordered to go back to California for my husband. 

First time here and I will be back when I find myself in the East coast. The customer service was exceptional, the decor is one of a kind, and the menu is affordable.

Please make one in California!! :))"}
{"text":"Charlotte, NC- A taste of Paris in the middle of the south. I highly recommend it from its coffees to it's pastries to it's sandwiches Amelie's does an excellent job providing an atmosphere that transports you to Paris"}
{"text":"I been most of Amelie's location just happen to live nearest this one. I and been many times. I must say the whole reason I go is for the flaky layered Napoleons and Tarts. Everything else is okay but I not much a dessert person. Regardless, the Napoleons are really good. 

Btw the macaroons were good too and taste similar to other french bakeries from bigger cities. It just macaroons aren't my thing and after a bite or two I am tired of them."}
{"text":"must try Napoleon and the tarts!"}
{"text":"Coffe is great and the baguette is wonderful, but getting a breakfast sandwich and paying $.75 extra for Gruyere on my sandwich I would have hoped it would be warmed and have Gruyere worth the extra charge."}
{"text":"I have to start with a confession.  I finally made time to visit Amelie's to taste their famous salted caramel brownie because they've actually shared the recipe for these decadent treats online.  So I had to try it to see what I was going to recreate.  Standing in front of what seemed to be cases of magic, I couldn't help but order a few more things.  Then I soon realized, I need to take pictures of it all so I can try something new on my next visit, and many there after.  

The brownie was rich and chocolatey and the caramel gooey...okay, exactly what the name states.  It's definitely a dessert that you need to plan on savoring with a drink while relaxing and just enjoying the scenery.  

The iced cinnamon pull apart bread made me nostalgic of the first fresh baked monkey bread I tasted as a child.  My drink of choice this go round was the crème brulee French soda.  What an interesting combination and pretty perfect for this hot summer day.  

The moral of the story, whatever you order will probably be delicious.  Just order what makes you happy or brings back a memory and enjoy the ambiance.  Better yet, take a friend and catch up.  I saw some people \"studying\", but who are you kidding, this place is too cute to stay focused."}
{"text":"Delicious desserts!! The salted caramel brownie, chocolate mousse cup, and the peach tart are my favorites. Although, I don't think I've had any dessert from Amelie's that wasn't good! Be prepared for a long line though. It seems like this place is always crowded, regardless of time of day."}
{"text":"I will be back the next time I am in town! I got a lemon lavender dessert (forgot what it was called), it was so light and delicious. Besides dessert, they serve food too and I can't wait to try them! The cafe has plenty of seating area (but I would imagine it gets packed around lunch time), and cute decorations."}
{"text":"I was here on a Thursday for lunch a few weeks ago with a colleague. It was 12:45pm and it was packed! Multiples lines to order and it took about 10 minutes to put in our orders. This spot is known for their specialty lemonades. So I had to order a lavender lemonade with my vegetable quiche. 

The place is quite cute and quirky at the same time. Cute with French decor and cool lighting fixtures but quirky with a modern bar area and lots of interesting seating options. The cafe is quite large not what you would expect when you think French cafe. I picked up my lemonade drink at the bar...it was delicious. Then we sat on some nice arm chairs with a side table between us. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. The quiche was okay. Overall it was a good spot but not too impressed with what I ordered. 

I am up for giving this another try for lunch or even try breakfast. The pastries looked very tasty. Next time I will go early for lunch and hope to avoid some of the crowd."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their Napoleon and love the pistachio macaroons. Their salted caramel brownie ain't half bad either. The only thing I don't like is that you have to let their pastries thaw a bit, and it may just be an issue with the display fridge temperature. Either way, the pastries, service and variety are all winners."}
{"text":"I'm sorry.  But, Amelie's is kind of overrated.

That being said, I'm giving this one four-stars because the wifi actually works consistently at this location.

If you're from out-of-town, you'll probably like it.  (The vast selection is, admittedly, cool.)"}
{"text":"Omg. The moment I walked in to this beautiful bakery I was absolutely delighted by the ambiance and decor. It is a Parisian paradise. I assumed they wouldn't have anything I could eat because I am allergic to wheat. To my surprise they offer several gluten free options. They even have almond milk for your latte. I hear they are open 24 hours too. I think that's perfect for students, artists, and night owls. I am visiting from Chicago. When I return to NC I will definitely make this one of my go to spots."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden nook! Such a great place to hang out and spend quality time with friends!"}
{"text":"We were visiting in Charlotte this past weekend and tried Amélie's for the first time.  So good and the weather was perfect for sitting outside.  The French Press and breakfast sandwiches were amazing.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Food is consistent,  parking can be tough but it is just a heavy plaza"}
{"text":"When you visit Charlotte you must visit Amelie's... any of the locations. If you're a local, a visit here will take you on a trip to France. 

The primary food you'll find is French Bakery food- pastries, sandwiches. (The best Macaroons in town) Coffee is available and fresh brewed. The location in NODA is incredibly scenic and has a great outdoor seating area. (Pet friendly). It's not just a restaurant, it would be a great place to bring a date on a little adventure, chat with friends in good conversation. 

The pastries are delicious. The sandwiches are unique and authentic. The coffee is great. Amélie's is fun, tasty, and a place you won't forget."}
{"text":"Tarts..... unimpressive- I had apple and peach
Mousse...... Heaven in a cup, a definite buy at a reasonable cost!
Blueberry Lemon mouse cake thingies,- much ado about noting
- Final opinion- unless you're already in the area, skip this place"}
{"text":"With over 350 reviews, I'm not really sure much is left to be said about Amelie's. So I'll save my eloquent writing skills for another review and just tell you to get a Chocolate Croissant.

It's....Flaky. Chocolaty. Warm. Delicious. 

Add a cup of coffee and just sit back, and get the full experience. Take in the tons of small eclectic details and people buzzing around and you may just feel as if you're in a cafe is Paris! 

Okay...maybe not Paris....but I really liked this place and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Think Panera Bread with a larger more interesting environment and some additional selections you'll have a good idea of what to expect here.  Some menu items, such as the soup and quiche varieties, change daily.  There is a fairly large selection of pastries.  Overall if you enjoy Panera, you're probably not going to be disappointed here either."}
{"text":"I am always in the mood for the amazing treats that await me at Amelie's, I am never in the mood for the wait at Amelie's. If you have time and patience then you are sure to enjoy the amazing selection of pastries, torts, macaroons, brownies, and more. I really wish I knew the secret time to go when I didn't have to wait in that god awful line."}
{"text":"I must say, Amelie's is one of the best! I'm not from Charlotte, or even from North Carolina for that matter, so when my friend told me she was taking me to a bakery, I thought \"what's so special about a bakery?\" 

I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of choices there were. I mean they had everything! Pumpkin pies, cakes, muffins, cream puffs, croissant, french macaroons and so much more. I was also surprised that they had a breakfast and dinner menu as well. However, if you're looking for a full hearty meal, this is not the place. The dinner menu consists of soups, chicken salads and small sandwiches. 

The atmosphere is just awesome. A quirky twist on old french decor makes everything so inviting and warm and if you look closely, you'll find hidden messages on the walls that will make you giggle. 

My one piece of advice is to check the menu while standing on line or before you get there. The line itself if VERYYYY long, so once you get to the counter, just be ready to order! 

happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I work close by so I decided to hit up Amelie's for some V-Day treats.  I was pleasantly surprised at the wide array of yummy treats to choose from.  Not only did they have their normal pastries, tarts, etc. on display, but they had delicious heart-shaped cookies, chocolate-covered strawberries ($2.99 each - ouch) and a little trio of red and pink petit fours especially for the holiday.  I elected to grab one of those cookies, a salted caramel brownie (how could you not) and a couple of the chocolate-covered berries.  Everything was wonderful.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Late night treat go-to. Berry tart - delish, cream puff - delish, salted caramel brownies - sinful. The one time I didn't get dessert there, I ordered this open face mushroom sandwich and was very impressed (and surprised). The whimsical French Alice in Wonderland decor is cute and fun. Giving 4 stars because the staff can get a little snippy when the line is long (which I get, but your job is customer service)."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. It was like crack omg I thought I was dreaming it was so good. I got a sandwich and lemonade and macaroons and I was in love so I highly recommend eating your last meal here because you really won't regret it I swear on god bruh"}
{"text":"Go here on occasion. Get a French pastry and indulge. But watch out for LONG lines. Every wants a salted caramel brownie."}
{"text":"I came here for a coworkers baby shower and could not have been more impressed with the space, the food, and the employees. 

If you've never been beyond the pastry case in the front of this location you are missing out. It extends so far back it's hard to believe. They have so many little nick-knacks to look at you'll never be bored.

I also didn't realize you could rent the place out. Someone told me that it could hold a wedding party of 80! We only had the back rooms rented out for about 20 people and it was plenty of space. 

Amelie's provided quiche Lorraine which was wonderful, as well as a spinach quiche, their famous pastries, coffee, and orange juice. I was so impressed with their food I took some home to my husband, who took literally a bite out of everything because he couldn't decide what to eat."}
{"text":"We had chocolate petit at  Amelie's and it's was delicious. Just one little thing in the middle it was a little on the  dry side but yummy. They have great selection of desserts. There was so much to choose from."}
{"text":"Another visit another wonderful experience...late on a Wednesday night and there isn't a seat inside - always a great place to people watch, enjoy? some music and of course indulge in a wonderful dessert and drink.

I nibbled on the fruit tart again this time and the berries and kiwi were just delicious!  I sipped on a Chai Latte - Amelie's has my all time favorite! - as well and both were wonderful!

If you've never been - I promise you that you won't be disappointed and they are open 24 hours a day - what's your excuse?!?!"}
{"text":"Pastries are good, and coffee is okay. If your a coffee lover this is not your place. If your a pastry lover then it is. Also, some of the rooms were awkwardly quiet while other rooms where playing music in the background. Maybe your thing if your studying to sit in the quiet rooms, but I prefer music playing in the background."}
{"text":"They are not that nice and did nothing about having freezing cold air blown on me today. I asked twice, nothing done"}
{"text":"I love the eclectic atmosphere. ..I also love the assortment of desserts!! The lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast. My favorite sweet is the Salted Caramel Brownie. .soooooo yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is overrated! French macaroons was the worst I've ever had. The texture was rubbery and the filling wasn't good at all. Waited for my coffee for 15 minutes and the taste was another disappointment. On top of that, the bathroom was dirty! I wouldn't come back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch while in town for a leadership conference. All i can say is you have to try ALL the macaroons!!! So cute and cozy too. Super friendly staff. Definitely a must next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome. The first thing I noticed was the eccentric decor. My food and coffee were delicious and came out very quickly. Lots of seating available. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast and I would absolutely come back here!!"}
{"text":"Late Night date night after the Hornets Game. French Press, Creme Brûlée, Vanilla Eclair and Salted Caramel Brownie! Can I say more, a dessert lovers dream. Place is a very hip and spacious.great for meetings, groups, dates and etc. Several items on the menu including sandwiches.

This is one of our favorite spots to come, people watch and relax. 2 locations one in the center of downtown and the other in Noda."}
{"text":"Amelie's was filthy and it makes it uncomfortable to imagine eating there when everything in the building looks so unclean, including the pastry case where they store the food."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere, with fair prices to boot. A good place to get away and study for a while, if you're looking for somewhere with life, but still maintains a sense of peace and quiet."}
{"text":"Get the leek soup and a macaron! Dang. So good. I'm not a fan of the vibe it's like a french Applebee's but who even cares because they're open 24/7, the food is GREAT, and there's always room to study."}
{"text":"awesome pastry selection every time---amazing!!"}
{"text":"My friends and husband brought me here today. They had all been here before. The friends said we are going for the twice baked almond croissant. 
And it was amazing. Yes of course I had to get one......and it was the last one. 
I can't even begin to describe the perfection that I found in this pastry. 
(My husband had brought me French macaroons from here before. And they were lovely). But my god the almond croissant. I will have dreams about the almond croissant. 

And that's not all.
Rebecca was so amazing helping me find the perfect drink.
 I said, \"caffeine, hot, sweet but not too sweet. \"
\"salted caramel brownie café mocha\", she says without hesitation. 
Ok, sounds great. No, great doesn't even begin to describe how perfect this drink was.  Milky, smooth, perfection. 

In the car on the way home (we live an hour away)
I told my husband, anytime you want to come here. Just say so and we are on our way. 

Thank you. Thank you for existing."}
{"text":"Popped in for breakfast on a short trip to Charlotte.  It was nice, clean, easy going, and very spacious. Coffee selection was great, especially for the value.  Inside they also offer a bar for local beers and champagne, and have a sizable bakery.  The building itself is a neat atmosphere, full of portraits and drawings.. you can tell a number of local creatives work there, and it suits them well!

Wife and I each got a \"made to order\" egg sandwich and coffees.  The coffee was well flavored (and again, good value), egg sandwich was good enough to have again, but not as tasty as I expected.  The croissant was fresh, but too flaky and fell apart, and the sandwich sat heavier than it needed to.  Still, we did enjoy it and would certainly stop in again (if we were locals)."}
{"text":"Such an adorable venue. First visit to the NoDa location. Great freshly made bakery items. French Press was not only affordable, but very delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here and let's just say, as soon as we walk into the bakery, the line was REALLY long... but the case and rows of pastries caught my eye - they were so appealing and just look so delicious. I can say that, i mustve started at the display case for at least 10 minutes before realizing, the line starts all the way at the other side of the bakery. It really didnt take long for the line to move- so that was good.

As far as the pastries -ehhh. They are ok, Macaroons was all right, I think, our pastry chef here at works does a way better job. 

All I can say is SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIE - if you havent tried anything in this bakery, THIS IS THE GO TO ITEM! i am in love with this dessert.

Besides the long line, a-ok macaroons. They made up for the salted caramel brownie. I will be back just for that."}
{"text":"Location here is lovely: large and spacious, with their traditional faire. This location is so much better than their cramped noda location. Love the breakfast croissants!"}
{"text":"i love their real location in noda, however my mom ordered me a cake from this location for my birthday, and it had the honor of being the worst tasting birthday treat of my life. It was a chocolate cake, so, pretty hard to mess up, but they managed. the frosting was like dry hard sugar gunk, and the cake was somehow dry and soggy at the same time. it tasted like the crappy-est store brand instant cake mix i have ever had. the raspberry layer was cloying and artificial. Dont waste your money on cakes here, they taste worse than pre-frozen restaurant supply truck cakes. gross."}
{"text":"Ahh so good. The line is pretty crazy and they could do to have more seating/a few larger tables, though. The croque Monsieur has a long cooking time, but is well worth it. The French lavender lemonade and the pastries are quick and SO delicious."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the almond cupcake and they were really good. Also had the meaty quiche but I didn't like it that much. We also had other treats that was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is GORGEOUS ! I L-O-V-E the decor and the vibe. I love that you can bring your laptop here and just nestle into a small corner or open area of the Bakery, plug laptop in, put headphones on and just cast all the noise away. This place is HUGE and you really can spread out as much as you want. 

The service was OK - perhaps it was a busy day but I think it could have been improved. Reason One - Minus five star.

I ordered a bunch of stuff w/ coffee but the one thing i remember the most were the macaroons. They were not great, perhaps they were out from early morning? To be fair, I was there around 2PM-ish. They were just rock HARD. The coffee was ok, but Coffee in Charlotte overall is OK.
Reason Two - minus five star ( hard macaroons). 

I will definitely return but perhaps at an earlier time."}
{"text":"Too sweet for my taste,  extremely expensive, not that good !!! Always crowd, still think is not that good! 

I stopped by today to get a coffee just because it was on my way to work, otherwise I wouldn't even choose this place, the line was insane and the macaroons are extremely sweet I didn't like them!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The coffee and apple turnovers are great. I can't believe I have passed by this place so many times and hadn't thought to try it till this week. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee that I have found (so far) in Charlotte. I love the casual atmosphere and the food is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I love the theme of this 24-hour bakery, their staff has always been pleasant, and most of their foods and beverages are on point... BUT I will honestly say that I am highly disappointed with your \"cream puffs\". First of all, the filling inside of the pastry was NOT cream, it was CUSTARD and it took up the entire inside of the \"puff\". Second, the pastry was maybe at most a quarter of an inch thick of some sort of dense, chewy dough- not puffed pastry dough whatsoever. They should probably rename these as their French name then elaborate that they are \"like a cream puff but...\". 

I was so looking forward to a [filo dough] puffed pastry with cream inside, not a chewy ball filled with custard. This was an unpleasant surprise and next time I will just go to different bakery [or the freezer section of Harris Teeter] to get the typical cream puff instead of here.

Also, even though the macarons have good flavors they seem to always be stale from sitting inside the the case all day. They need to figure out a way to refrigerate them to where the shell doesn't become firm. I've had macarons from both Earth Fare and Cafe Monte yet both of theirs are always soft and practically melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Finally, it's near our home. A great place for a late night sweet and coffee.
Bravo"}
{"text":"Just a wonderful little cafe - perfect for studying, catching up, or just savoring a fresh sandwich au jambon.  The only hard part is choosing which treat to indulge in!"}
{"text":"Eclectically decorated (no two tables are alike), a very fun place.  Great pastries and a good variety of teas, coffees and a espresso drinks (although no decaf espresso).  Friendly, helpful service too."}
{"text":"Tried it yesterday, the place has a super hipster vibe to it, and a lot of sitting spaces. The service was really fast regardless of the long line. I really like the fact that it's 24/7, because you never know when the urge to get some macarons will hit you :) I tried raspberry, mixed berry and hazelnut macarons yesterday. First two were delicious, the hazelnut tasted more like a merengue, but it wasn't bad. Wish they had some floral flavors like rose or lavender. Definitely coming back to try more of the sweets and the savory items from the menu."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at the Carmel Road location. I didnt like the set up given the large number of customers and a very slow and limited number of staff. Tables were not being cleaned and my party of 4 had difficulty finding a place to sit after standing in line for far too long. I have eaten at the original location in Noda several times. I think the menu offers different dishes than the usual lunch spots. The bakery alone could make me a loyal customer. The small intimate seating works for Noda location but I don't think t's working for Carmel Road lication. There are far too many customers in this larger facility to do things the same way as Noda."}
{"text":"Everything is spot on. Decided to make drive and have an indulgent Saturday. Awesome decor inside and the staff was really friendly. They took the time to describe everything for me. Maybe I got lucky because the line was short and service was fast. The latte was small but very tasty. A++"}
{"text":"Went on opening day around 9:30 and was shocked that there wasn't a crowd.  I agree with the reviewer that the cashier was blank and not very personable.  Maybe she was stressed, but a smile will go a long way. I too noticed just one trash bin inside. Would be nice to have the coffee urns on the counter like the RH location. Makes for speedier refills when the line is busy with more complicated requests. Enjoyed the freshness of th pastries. Also this location seems roomier and the patio is a huge plus. All in all I give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The salted caramel brownie was nice: a modest sized chocolatey brick thats halfway between a brownie and fudge capped with a generous layer of slightly salty caramel that's not overbearingly sweet. The mixed berry fruit tart was just alright: a standard crust filled with slightly baked fresh fruit that was refreshing indeed with a subtle custard filling."}
{"text":"Not worth the $12 you'll likely spend on a baked good and coffee. I've been to every Amelie's location in Charlotte and the only one that delivers quality is the NoDa Amelie's.

After dinner yesterday we went to the Park Road location. Their dessert case isn't as robust as others but that didn't bother me because whatever I taste I care about the quality. We ordered two macaroons, a petite four, and slice of cake. The cake was good, the macaroons were okay, but my hazelnut petite four truly tasted like it had freezer burn (kind of like if cardboard had a taste).
To me, if I pay $2.15 for a dessert it should be worth it's wait because baking is such a unique skill.

The atmosphere was fine, it's an open floor plan and a bit noisey but you can comfortably have a conversation. I wouldn't be able to study at this location though or read a book."}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish there was an Amelie's close to me! The simplest of food there (i.e. bread and butter) is always like a feast because it is fresh and delicious and you can taste the quality ingredients and care that goes into every single item. The pastries are fit for King Louis XIV and the quiches are inventive and utterly melt in your mouth. I could go on and on. Simply said, there is a reason why the line is long and the 5-star reviews are plentiful. Vive l'Amelie's!"}
{"text":"Ok....Ok....I know this review will not be favored amongst other yelpers.  I'm not a huge fan of Amelie's. 
  One night, my boyfriend and I decided to hop in here on a dreary Saturday night after being in the Plaza Midwood area.  I was in search of a latte and he had a sweet tooth.  While the line was about 8 people deep, it moved rather quick.  I've since learned that this number of patrons was an anomaly as the line is usually wrapped around the room.  Anyways, we tried the Salted Caramel Brownie that EVERYONE loves, a few Tortes and a strawberry croissant.  First off, they did not want to make a latte....not at all.  I don't blame them, it was not that good.  I don't think I was able to finish all of it.
   We were not impressed with the brownie either, it was just a thick chunk of caramel plopped on top of a dry brownie.  Maybe we got a bad batch or something but it was not the \"raved\" about dessert that I was hoping for.  I had the same problem with their layered tortes....dry and not flavorful.  The croissant was....not the warm, buttery pastry that you would envision.  
   I would love to love Amelie's but I just don't.  I DO like the fact that it's open 24hrs. and I find it a good place to sit and people watch.  I plan on returning for a third time to try it once more, have a plain coffee and sit to work on some writing."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the desserts are definitely good. There's always a crowd and they can run out of some of their more popular desserts. There's a good variety, unique decor, and the line moves pretty fast. If you come during peak hours it can definitely be hard to find a seat and you may have to stand in a line that goes out the door and wraps around the corner. The prices I think are high for Charlotte, they're pretty much what I would pay in LA for the same thing but the desserts are good. And it's one of the few places in Charlotte that's not a bar but open late."}
{"text":"After my wonderful date night we stopped here for a late night snack and latte. 

Awesome coffee with a cute foam heart
Nice staff
Yummy treats when I shouldn't be eating them 
Super hip decor 
Clean and tidy
Reasonable prices
Sometimes the lines are long but move quite quickly 

Always a go to spot any time of day"}
{"text":"This is a super cute pastry shop! It really did remind me of a shop you may find in France.   The decor and ambiance is colorful and fun. 

I selected a variety:  mini tarts and macarons.   The macarons are a little too sweet for me, but the tarts were quite yummy.   

The shop also serves savory items so will have to return for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to stop after dinner, or anytime for that matter.  I'm a sucker for the chocolate eclairs.  Don't let the line scare you, you'll make your way to the counter in no time.  Fun decor, take a good look around."}
{"text":"3 words...salted caramel brownie!!! This is one of the most delicious sweet treats in Charlotte. So yummy! If you have a craving for a sweet treat, this should do the trick. Sandwiches as just okay but the desserts are amazing and the soups are wonderful."}
{"text":"Really delicious pastries.
Not only are the yummy, but also so appealing to the eyes!
The shop is spacious and I love the pastel colors/delicate wall decor.

But do note, it is really crowded in there- at all times. The line was rather annoying.
Also, their bathrooms are THE DIRTIEST.
I guess being open 24/7 is the reason.
Seriously, urine-all-over-the-floor dirty.
Long story short, I had to take my pastries to go.

Regardless of the crowd/lack of cleanliness, I'll have to come back since their pastries are quite possibly the best in NC."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a new fan of Amélie's! We came in at 3:30am in the late Saturday/early Sunday morning for a late night snack. This location of Amélie's is opened 24 hours. Amélie's is probably the cutest coffee, sandwich, dessert, and hangout store. It has lots of personality with the decor. The staff are really nice and will help with any questions you may have and offer suggestions depending on what you like.

What We Ordered:
- Crème Brûlée || So good. They of course torch the sugar top of the dessert. This dessert is just delectable. Probably the beset creme brulee I have ever had. 
- Fruit Danish || they are generous with the amount of fruits on this danish. It was very colorful 
- Salted Caramel Brownie || this is a pretty popular item and has equal parts brownie and caramel on top of the brownie. If you're a fan of caramel, you will LOVE this. 
- Raspberry Lemonade Tea || fresh raspberries are crushed and placed into the tea. The drink is good, but a little too sweet for my taste buds.

Overall, I am happy to find out that Amélie's just recently open another location in Atlanta which is closer to me. I'll stop by this location the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I've been twice this week while in town for work.  I highly recommend the turkey and brie sandwich, it was superb. Everything is fresh and perfectly made, I really can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"After our dinner at Cabo, bf and I decided to get something sweet. This was our first time trying Amelie's and were not disappointed.  We shared a peach tart and a Yelp favorite- salted caramel brownie. It is very sad ( in a good way) that we were wanting more of these very tasty and addictive treats. Lol. We had some restraint, but will definitely be making more trips to Amelie's."}
{"text":"Chicken Salad Sandwich and pumpkin bisque were both on point. Both surprisingly super delicious. I wish I had gotten full sizes of both instead of the half.

I also went nuts and tried their salted caramel brownie, lemon puff pastry, sticky bun, lemon macaron, mini versions of the smores, lemon, and pumpkin tart. Of all of them, I really liked the lemon tart and the sticky bun. After reading all the hype the Salted caramel brownie was okay... It's more caramel than brownie though. Felt like I was eating spoonfuls of caramel, and I LOVE me some salted caramel.

So what I did is take the salted caramel and put it on my sticky pecan bun. After 20 seconds in the microwave, it perfectly warm and epic."}
{"text":"I've been to many bakeries across the country... Laduree in SoHo, Magnolia in Rockefeller Center, Tartine in The Mission... 
I came to Charlotte for work and I wasn't expecting to find such a hidden gem, but I have got to say that Amelies is one of the best bakeries I've been to! Their salted caramel brownies are to die for and the petit fours were on point.

This place is a must if you're ever in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I went here today and I really loved the decor. I got the open face sandwich w/ roast beef with sauté onions and blue cheese. It was good but a little cold and dry. It had no mayo or anything. We also got some pastries and they were delicious! Especially the lemon tart and twice baked almond croissant. The main negative was the bathrooms were filthy. All in all I would go back, especially for pastries! The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"My first visit was delightful. If not for the not so amazing creme brulee', I would have given 5 stars. We tried the salted caramel brownie, key lime tart ( my favorite of all) tea cakes and cafe au lait. My husband enjoyed his gluten free treats. The creme brulee' was not what I expected. It was cold, through and through, did not have a crispy top and tasted more like pudding. Not horrendous, but not what I had hoped for. I loved the décor and I hope to go back again, soon."}
{"text":"I always wait in line. Always. But it's totally worth it, every single time. When three people who have spent significant time in France agree that a place is both authentic & consistently amazing, then it's a good place. Maybe I'll try 3am to avoid the line ;)"}
{"text":"Nice location Uptown. Love the salad options, and the protein additions are tasty.  Pastries are tempting, and the coffee is good."}
{"text":"Here's the thing with this place: It's really freaking good. The thing is that it's so good and it's always so full that the  experience takes a hit. If you go at night the line wraps around the store and it's not very organized. The napoleons are the best, but more often than not they are right out of the freezer, so you have to take it home and wait for it to get good. The macarons are good and not too expensive. Overall I recommend it, but not during peak hours"}
{"text":"Um, WOW. Charming French bakery heaven in the South! Whoa! Uh, lets see, what don't they have?!!! 

- Chocolates, pastries, sweets galore. Check! 
- Coffees, teas, and other pallet satisfying drinks. Check! 
- Awesome Impressionist pastel colors decor. Check! 
- Board games. Check! 
- Parking lot. Check! 
- Open 24 hours. Check! 
- Takes credit cards. Check! 
- Uber comfy chairs. Check! 

If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be at this place ALL THE TIME."}
{"text":"Cute decor with tons of space and varied seating. The array of macaroons is out of this world. They don't have Green Tea Matcha Latte's which is quite strange to me personally. They do carry a variety of green tea options. I had a breakfast sandwich once which wasn't appetizing. It was supposed to be an egg sandwich, however it tasted like the plastic variety they serve at McDonalds."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that this place is awesome. I wish is wasn't so busy all the time (well I can't speak to 2 am) but I suppose it has a reason to be busy. The coconut and French macaroons, mini tarts, chocolate and cream cheese croissants, and palmiers are all delicious. Customer service is pretty great. Everyone is nice and they move the line as fast as they can.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. Note, parking can get a little crazy. They have this weird gravel parking lot adjacent to the normal parking lot, however it is unclear if you can actually park there. Every time we've parked in that lot we sit outside and watch for tow trucks...just FYI."}
{"text":"Food, outdoor dining, and pastries are AWESOME!  The service could use a shot of friendly."}
{"text":"Try the salted caramel brownies (they come in gluten free as well)!"}
{"text":"I practically LIVE here! Amelie's space is masked with eclectic decor, yielding a very casual and relaxed environment. There is a second location in uptown Charlotte, but replicating the same vibe is just impossible! Throughout college, I spent most of my time in the back atrium, utilizing their free wi-fi and working on various projects. Yes, I was a moocher! The best part is that the staff will serve you both inside the bakery and in the atrium!

The first thing you see when you come in is their vast selection of DESSERTS!!! I tell myself that I will try something new every time I come here, but I always revert to the Napoleon or Salted Caramel Brownie. They're just oh so yummyyy! The food is just as delicious. I recommend trying one of their soups of the day. None of them have failed me."}
{"text":"This is the best bakery in NC. Hands down. The atmosphere, decor, and ambience is like none other!! Me and my boyfriend discovered this little gem and were blown away! The prices are phenomenal for the quality of dessert you are getting. The caramel brownie torte was amazing!! Also, the bite sized cream desserts were incredible too!! I will absolutely be coming back tons!!"}
{"text":"This place does not have the same ambiance as the NoDa cafe.  All the same food though.  Amelie's has the best Chai Tea latte in city.  Salted Caramel brownies are delicious.  I have been several times with friends who ordered various pastries and gave them high marks.  Twice, I have had the chicken salad croissant and both times had an upset stomach after. So I am wondering if the mayo is left out too long?  I am sticking to lattes and pastry.  If you are looking for a quiet place to chat and linger over coffee, not sure this it.  It is VERY loud here and challenging to find a parking space.  I have been on Tues night and it is just as packed as Saturday morning.  It is one big room, not several unique rooms like the NoDa cafe. The decor does try to be similar and it is interesting.   You order at the register near the pastry counter, but there is a barista counter and they will call you when your order is ready.  A few others have made comments about the customer service.  I have probably been here 6 times, close to a place I have to be regularly, and I have found the staff friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Awesome! They make my tongue sing!!! The decor is Boho-Parisianne, chic and fun! 

And whether you get their Leek soup, one of their amazing panini's or tantalizing pastries, you are sure to want to take some to go too! 

Oh! And you can order fancy things like wedding cakes from them too! 
And they do parties VERY reasonably!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"oh my goodness!  I would come if the Salted Caramel Brownie was the only thing they served.  :)"}
{"text":"I love this location of Amelie's. The only downfall is it's hard to find the first time. On GPS, you will look like you keep passing it in Park Rd Shopping Center. It's actually immediately BEHIND the main section of the shopping center. It's behind the Caribou Coffee/bagel place. There's a small road behind the shopping center and you get to it from there. This location has a lot of room, yet is made so quaint and comfy. There are many sections with couches, small and a couple bigger tables, a fireplace. The pastry selection is wonderful and SO yummy. And the coffee and bar area is top notch. Much larger than other locations. There is a large patio to sit and it's very comfortable."}
{"text":"I love going to get my nails done a few doors down so I can shop in Amelies after. The treats are beautiful.  Nothing better than pretty food. The coffee was good too. I have the Napoleon.  Creamy goodness. Haven't seen one so luscious since my place in Brooklyn  NY by 5 corners . ANYWAY  . Brought home tarts and danish  and whatever that is but it was good. Ya know you really can't go wrong with whatever you feeling a taste of. Nicely boxed goodies. They may not make it home. Shhh I ate the hubby blue berry berry tart . He will never know but oh my gawd. Thank ya lawd. Our secret."}
{"text":"Love the eclectic design. Fun place for coffee and amazing sweet treats. Wonderful sandwich and salad menu. And also enjoy a glass or wine with a decadent  chocolate cake."}
{"text":"worth the wait in line.  But make sure you are in the right line.  It got confusing which line was for 1. drinks only, 2. food, drinks, dessert or 3. dessert only.  Seeing what was on the menu and the delicate deserts, I made sure I was in line to select a bit of everything.  I had a salmon crepe in beurre blanc sauce, a fancy sparkling lemonade, pecan tart and brought home an assortment of macarons.  The salmon crepe was 10 stars of deliciousness and an another 10 stars for presentation.  The salmon was broiled to perfection, giving it a very juicy center along with a slight crunch on the outside  excellent!.  
Being around noon on a saturday, the place was packed and tonnes of people in line.  It was worth the 15 minute wait in line and another 5-10 minutes to chat, waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Great place   Great to people watch.   Open 24/7.   Free wifi.    Different rooms to sit and talk and work"}
{"text":"Wow! When I saw the trendy arty decor I thought it would be expensive and mediocre but the prices are fair and the food is truly excellent.  Probably the best croissant I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte hands down! 

They are located in the trendy NoDa district so business is always crowded with customers. They are open 24/7 365! I love that because I can just come here whenever I have a sweet tooth. Be prepared though, there will most likely be a line but wait isn't unbearable.

My favorites are the raspberry tart and the salted caramel brownie. Their macarons are so yummy too! $2 a piece but totally worth every penny! They always have fresh pastries coming out of the kitchen. 

I've never been to France but Amelie's always makes me feel like I'm there! If you're craving something sweet, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Ooh la la.... I felt like I was in an  European cafe. This place is so fancy but inviting. Mona Lisa everywhere and every corner of this place has a cute place to sit and enjoying your time there. Food was delish! Great place for pictures."}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend works near by so when I go and see him at work I stop by and get a BLT and usually a mouse cup. The only reason for 4 stars is because of the line. It moves decently fast but is always so long and I hate having to wait to order. Overall, a great place!"}
{"text":"Insanely cute and homey spot to spend an afternoon or evening. And if they don't offer the dessert of your dreams I'd be amazed. The macaroons alone would keep your sweet tooth satisfied for a long long time. Yum."}
{"text":"Oh jesus, what a great place. Excellent pastries and the sandwiches are awesome. Just the plain croissant is a whole new experience"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been written about Amelie's?  If you appreciate the occasional sweet treat, this place has the best in Charlotte.  I am a fan of macaroons and theirs are simply delish.  The macaroons I have tried here include pistachio, lemon, salted caramel, passion-fruit, and coconut. I particularly enjoyed the coconut and the lemon.  Another favorite treat here is the salted caramel brownie - it has the perfect balance of sweet and just a hint of salt in the creamy caramel. 

There are so many goodies behind the counter that I have not tried yet, and I am always looking forward to my next visit.  The hard part is choosing between the éclairs, napoleons, tarts, and all of the other yummy-looking pastries!  Thank goodness they aren't close to my work or home, or I'd be having to put in a lot of extra gym time to work off all those extra calories!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the quiche along with the breakfast sandwich is great. The pastries are top notch. Coffee is not bad could be stronger"}
{"text":"I've been to many bakeries across the country... but I can honestly say that this is not as good of a bakery as I was lead to believe. 

I came to Charlotte for work and I told by everyone that this was likely the best bakery in Charlotte, with some of the best coffee. I have got to say that Amelies is a good bakery and it's definitely worth a visit. However, I can certainly attest to having better coffee at 7th Street Market and know at least 2 bakeries in Durham, NC that have better pastries and bread by a LONG shot.

To the average person who's use to WallMart croissant this is certainly a breath of fresh air - but don't be mislead into thinking this is the best of the best!"}
{"text":"The chai expresso was to die for! It's been a week and I'm still dreaming of it! The breakfast sandwich was also amazing. Can't wait to be back in Charlotte to try more items."}
{"text":"Whoa was my first reaction when I went here. Bad or good, you decide. The place was packed at midnight on a Saturday, but the line moved quickly. The space is humongous, and allows for you to wander through separate rooms. There is also a huge indoor courtyard and a \"hookah\" room. Every inch of this space is filled with \"French\" decor.  It's actually pretty over the top if you ask me. No amount of decor can make me forget I'm  inside a shopping center. Whatever, there's plenty of free parking!

They sell pastries, desserts, and sandwiches. The macaroons were great! The salted caramel brownie was a decadent salty/sweet treat. Everything else we had was decadent, but nothing special. I was a bit dissappointed with the eclairs. Perhaps, if I came in earlier, they would taste more fresh. 

Overall, fair prices and a great stop if you are craving desserts at any hour."}
{"text":"Looked cute and we were only needing a small bite to eat since it was late in that afternoon. Staff is rude and act like your an inconvenience. Food was ok but staff is the reason I won't come back"}
{"text":"I probably should have known better than to order a salad, but it was awful. They up sold me on chicken, which had a boiled consistency and made me gag. Tea cup was hardly full. Not too wowed by the uptown location in terms of food or service. Stay safe and grab a salted caramel brownie."}
{"text":"The desert and coffee are fine.  The place can have a line that gets out of control and doesn't really have enough seating."}
{"text":"We stopped by Amelie's after dinner and I was quite impressed.  The place was huge with plenty of seating.  I really like the way they have the place decorated with bright colors and lots of crazy art on the walls.  They had a wide variety of pastries to choose from which automatically makes them worthy of 4 stars in my book.  I tried a chocolate mousse cup and it was delightful!  It was so sweet I thought I'd have to stop after only 2 bites, but before I knew it the whole thing was gone.  I just couldn't stop myself!  The only drawback to this place was it was incredibly busy when we stopped by at 8:30pm on a weekday.  This is the type of place that I'd normally like to get a pastry and coffee and have a seat to relax for a bit.  With all the commotion I didn't think we'd be able to enjoy ourselves so we got our treats to go."}
{"text":"For me, this place is A-ok because I'm not a big sweets person and the baked goods are a little over priced, but it's a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"So many reviews, you can guess this place is popular.  The best thing about this place is the ambiance of the cafe itself.  It's truly the definition of shabby chic and I'm excited to bring my friends here after a concert just to hang out and eat some delish desserts.  I had the creme puff which was right on point.  The staff is super friendly and I would definitely come back not just every now and then, but often."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times. I've also visited the downtown location, but I prefer this one because I can always find a parking spot. 

You can usually find me here on Sunday for the quiche or the Provence BLT, which is my absolute favorite. Just the right amount of bacon without making you feel like a pig for eating bacon. I have tried several drinks. I have had the creme brulee french soda a few times, LOVE IT, and other coffee drinks. I haven't had one that I didn't like. 

Again, I like this location because there are several cozy little area where one can sit and be alone, yet in the middle of everything. Not to mention, you can easily share a table or couch with a stranger without it being uncomfortable."}
{"text":"So cute! They're located in the back of Park Road shopping center near Rock Salt. Desserts are consistent with the other Amelie's and staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this great place by a local. I travel from San Francisco & Amelie's is ALWAYS  my first stop. Being open 24 hours helps me achieve my goal no matter what time I fly in. Whenever they have their crab/tomato bisque on the menu, EAT IT. I haven't had one bad meal here. Croissant sandwiches, salads & other morsels are a delight.  Now I have to mention all the tender, luscious sweets they have on hand. What do you want? Cake, macarons, or perhaps a freshly made tart. YOU WILL DIE OF A SWEET ATTACK! Whoever is back there in that pastry kitchen is trying to murder us with sugar, I'm sure of it! The creative flavors of the macarons will tantalize the palate. Their chocolate cake is nice and moist & you will not leave a piece on that plate."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Service is always great. Food is always great. Love their Bacon and Turkey, and the squash soup. Also, you must try the cider this season. To die for."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning for a little something to jumpstart My Love's Birthday weekend. 

As I stood in line I tried to take in everything...the decor, food and drink menu items, and overall feel. If authentic French cafes are anything like this place, BOOK ME A TICKET!

Everyone was sitting doing their own thing just enjoying the moment. I attempted to read the menu items in my French voice in my head, but they came out sounding more like Spanish...wished my son was there.

I ordered the Provence BLT for us to share, two palmiers because I hardly ever share sweets, and an iced coffee with vanilla (not sure of the French name).

I conveniently left the items in the car so that when we hopped in to begin his birthday weekend...\"Well whaddayaknow breakfast for our ride out to the vineyards!\" Needless to say, the BLT still tasted amazing. It hadn't become soggy or anything, he loved it! And those palmiers, the lady who took my order told me something about it being coated over and over in butter and sugar and I was sold. It was flakey and sweet and just plain yummy!

It was a perfect beginning to what was a perfect day and weekend!"}
{"text":"Hmmm summary: Just Go There!
Honestly this place is super close to my brothers place and it's certainly one of our favorite spots to hit. The food is truly good and comes out super quick. I haven't had any of the desserts but I've had a few of the breakfast sandwiches and the lunch ones."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for a Girls Night Out and I ordered the Chocolate Mousse. It was really delicious. I didn't finish it because it was too sweet. I love the atmosphere of the place. This is my 3rd visit to Amelie's. I have been to the one in Uptown and Rock Hill."}
{"text":"This place was incredible! The pastries, atmosphere, the kind staff. Parking is good also, it's on the end of a strip mall.

Everything I had was fresh. You can taste the quality, like the butter in the puff pastries that doesn't make you feel like a glutton.

The place is spacious, great scene for laptops, dreamers, and lovers. I like how you can see what's going on in the kitchen, it adds to the intimacy. 

They have outside seating with huge umbrellas, they know the sun can get pretty brutal. It's a very thoughtful place, inside and out, cake and more."}
{"text":"I really like the decor of this cafe. It's a very Frenchy joint with small seats and tables. With the free wi-fi I would definitely sit there to get some work done. It is also a great place to sit down and catch up with friends which was exactly what I was doing. 

This place is packed! Good for them of course but it was difficult to lock in a seat of 2 even at 3pm. I shared a fruit tart with a friend and it was good. It was not the best fruit tart I have ever had in my life but I did enjoy it. If the small cupcake sized fruit tart was closer to $3 instead of $5 I would probably come here a lot more often. Unfortunately, not everybody is a Heisenberg (Breaking Bad Reference)."}
{"text":"A great little French bakery in NoDa. Love it to death. I'm often found there after my usual stops at a neighboring hookah bar."}
{"text":"This is so like my great & uncle's house (when they were alive, RIP).
Full of charm & antique-ish wares!

Busy, busy, busy...no matter when you go.  This is a favorite hang out spot for co-working, meetings, those \"hey, I just left the club & I am drunk\", \"hey, I need to pick up some treats for a party\"...& just plain, \"I WANT DESSERTS!\" 24/7 hours & you are in a win-win situation!  Also, if you're in the mood for soups & fancy sandwiches, you're in for a \"treat\", too.

My favorite are the little berry tarts. MMMM!  I'm also a fan of their salted caramel brownies.  

The coffee is STRONG, so beware! 

Oh such a great people watching place! :D  Go ahead & take your laptop / iPad / tablet device in with you & enjoy the free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"What can I say but Omg I love this place. The pastries are fabulous and the dessert choices are incredible. I usually eat a lunch Item  but chose a breakfast sandwich of sausage,mushrooms, onions and mozzarella cheese. One of the coolest things is taking your food to one of the areas and eating while looking at the fabulous decor. I love bringing my friends here and knowing that Amelie's is open 24 hrs a day. Check it out."}
{"text":"Generally, a good place to go on occasion.  Service has gone a bit downhill in the past year or so, not sure why."}
{"text":"Having been to the original location a bunch and seeing how the uptown location was designed, I think they did a good job setting up this spot. Very open and the layout is more conducive to having an actual line vs how the original shop is set up. I like the fact that there's an outside patio as well.

The two things I could see them improving on is maybe adding another register if they do have a rush and adding some more areas to put your leftover plates. Besides that, I can see this place being a welcome addition to the south side of the city."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to in Charlotte.  They are nestled in a historic building with lots of eclectic arts and extremely laid-back cozy vibe. The pastries are divine and they have something for everyone's dietary needs. The coffee is very good.  The customer service is amazing considering the line is always wrapping through the building. At some point maybe I'll actually go in and have a meal instead of just dessert."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great prices...too many hipsters.

Not a place I'd sit and eat, I get my stuff to-go"}
{"text":"Oh yeah it's good. Good sandwhiches and pastries and coffee."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars just for the atmosphere! So cute, so large, and do delicious! I was tempted to give 4 stars because the serving sizes are not the big for the buck but then I remember the flavors and I had to give it 5 stars. 

I love the twice baked croissant, the mini mousse cups, the leak soup, and their lemonades! (Not the sparking lemonades though)... It is a fun bonus when you can watch the bakers baking in their large zoo-like encasement :) I bet they get use to people watching them but it's just funny. 

If you go in the fall, get the apple cider!!! It's my favorite and I wish I could have it year round!"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place so we decided to check it out. To our surprise, this place is open 24/7/365! We went in around 10:30pm on a Saturday night and there was a line about 30 people long! Luckily the line moved quickly and I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate mousse cup with a chocolate covered strawberry on top! Absolutely delicious! Seating can be a challenge as it seems they're constantly busy, but we were able to find somewhere to sit and enjoy our drinks and pastries! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Surprised!  This place has a great variety and is a breath of fresh air to be something different from the ordinary coffee and pastry shop.  Finally something to look forward to in the morning.  Tried the turkey and bacon sandwich, the ham, egg, and gruyere sandwich, the salted carmel mocha, chai creme, and some of the pastries.  Nothing missed the mark."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for awhile now but had yet to make it out there...and boy oh boy I am so glad that I did I will definitely be coming again soon. 

Butter butter everywhere. I would trade chocolate any day for a baguette and butter. 

At Amelie's you don't have to trade in your chocolate but please dig your teeth into one of their classic french sandwiches like the croque monsieur and don't leave until you have a pastry... how about a chocolate croissant to go. I really wanted a taste of everything, since they're open 24 hours I probably could have done it. 

They also have a great espresso bar, I was really thirsty so I went with a lavender lemonade that was delicious and refreshing. 

Relax by yourself, or bring your friends. A very unique place and well worth every penny. 

."}
{"text":"Amelie's. It's an absolute Charlotte staple, honorable mention to the salted caramel brownie, but some of the most apathetic service in town, in my opinion. I'm not too amped on going to Amelie's.....really at all. If you've never been, check it out. If you're visiting from out of town, it's a must. If you're into kitschy decor, by golly, what are you waiting for? If you're into good pastries, look elsewhere. 

When I first moved to Charlotte, we were all about this joint. Board games, open 24/7, ample seating (inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row), and plenty of caffeine for late-night work sessions. So why 2 stars? Apathy. 

The service is just abysmal and the product(s) tend to suffer the consequences as result. The trendy little kids behind the counter \"go out of their way\" to serve you and, dare I say, ask \"who's next\" in line. There are plenty of things right with Amelie's. Get some staff that actually KNOW the products, give them a little more love, and then put them in front of people. Every time I've visited, which has been sparse in the past few years, I've been in line with newbies. They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff. But, instead, I've seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares. 

Upon our last visit, we went with some go-tos -- Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant. Both were kinda blah. Dry, had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days, and aren't what they used to be. You know....as long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same, I'm a happy camper. 

I still love you, Amelie's. You'll always have a place in my Charlotte-loving heart, but your service is just less than desirable."}
{"text":"Pure delight in every bite. That's all I have to say about this place. Love it!! Open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, this place is  awesome little eclectic coffee and dessert bar and Noda."}
{"text":"The decor for this bakery sure is nifty. Part of me hates is because it's borderline hoarder mentality with the overwhelming amount of random stuff and mismatched tables and chairs. But a part of me also adore it because it is so unique. 

Maybe I'm just a closest hoarder.

Came on the day of my flight back to NY, figuring that as a bakery that is opened 24/7, and I'm part of the church belt, it'd be sort of slow. Nope. I was wrong, thankfully the service was quick and I go the front of the line within 10 minutes or so.

I ordered a two macaroons, a mini berry tart, two bags of coffee, terragon & mint tea, and a roast beef sandwich. The tea itself was a bit on the disappointing side(should've just gotten iced black coffee). The tart, macaroons, and roast beef sandwich however, were very tasty. And still kind of left me wanting more. 

I dug it. You bet I'll be back if I'm ever back in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Love it here!  We have been coming here since before it was so popular. I'm happy to see how much it's grown and keeps growing! My husband even proposed to me here! Special place with special memories"}
{"text":"Took a day trip to Charlotte and wanted to explore the NODA area. We had plans for dinner in downtown but decided to stop by Amelie's bakery for a sweet treat first. So glad we did!! It was the highlight of our day trip to Charlotte! It is the most adorable bakery, super cool atmosphere, lots of seating, neat/eclectic decor. Then there are all the delicious baked goods! Where to even begin?! My husband and I decided to try a few of the mini treats-none of which disappointed! We tried the mini hazelnut tart, a peanut butter and chocolate pettifor, a cinnamon and chocolate macaroon, and a pecan sticky bun. They were all delicious! My favorite was the hazelnut tart and my husband's favorite was the sticky bun. Amelie's is a must stop any time we go to Charlotte from now on! If you haven't been, you're missing out! They also serve soups, salads, and sandwiches--we'll have to try the savory side of Amelie's next time!"}
{"text":"Used to be my go to study spot until recently. Changes with the way ordering is done (one line, through the bakery even if you aren't getting a pastry), understaffed, and unprepared for influxes during events in uptown. Usually forgivable, but three times now I've had to wait more than 30 mins for food orders that are light (quiche, usually prepared) after ridiculous wait time to order only to have my bill refunded. Shame to say this is now a common occurrence for a place that was once highly recommendable."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to satisfy your sweet tooth. I love there pastries, sandwiches even there drinks are great."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat! You have to go to Amelie's! The line is long (very long!), but it does more fast. They have so many delicious desserts to choose from, it's overwhelming. I ordered a chocolate crossiant, which they heated up for me. It was pretty good. My husband ordered a layered chocolate torte, which was really good. The staff was really friendly. You should definitely visit Amelie's! :)"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a Charlotte staple. My boyfriend and I have gone a few time and have to say we have decided their best attribute is their macaroons. They always have a wide variety, with great combinations you wouldn't think of like basil and lime which yes is seriously a choice they had last time we went. And let me tell you it was fantastic. 

The other dessert we get is the key lime tart it's tiny bit packs a delicious punch with its tart lime flavor and awesome meringue top. It's my go to the past three times we've gone! 

It's always busy late night but if you get there mid morning or late afternoon there much less of s line to wait in."}
{"text":"I went to Amelie's for the first time yesterday for lunch.  I had a half sandwich (turkey & brie) with soup (spinach, asparagus, and leek).  Both were very tasty and the portion size was just right.  My sister had the sausage and bell pepper quiche.  I tasted it and it was absolutely delicious...may have to order that next time.

Of course, we had to get desserts.  I had the salted caramel brownie because I'd heard so much about it.  It was really yummy, but extremely sweet and rich.  I think it would be great if they sold them in half portions.  Anyway, my sister had a mixed berry tart which was great also.

The atmosphere is trendy-eclectic.  It feels like a place I'd like to go to study (there were a lot of folks camped out there with laptops).

Only complaints: it's fairly pricey for what you get, and the staff isn't overly friendly.  I will definitely  be back though!"}
{"text":"Great desserts. Excellent decor and space, incredibly long tedious lines. I know they can't help their popularity but don't go on any night if you don't want a ten minute wait"}
{"text":"People in Charlotte must not use Yelp much. Only 17 reviews? This place seems to get a lot of business (but the lines move pretty quickly) and, I know why, it's fantastic.  

Walking into Amelie's feels like walking into a (very large) French cafe.  The food is freshly made and delicious, especially the breakfast sandwiches and salted caramel brownies.  And, the espresso drinks were great; in particular, the cafe marcotter was amazing!

The atmosphere is very nice and the place is huge, so you'll always have somewhere to sit.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and had the make your own breakfast sandwich. The food was great!!!!! The atmosphere is even better!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a wide variety of sweet treats and a large french press full of coffee then Amelie's is a good choice. If, however, you are looking for a seat actually inside the establishment and internet that actually works I suggest you look elsewhere.

See the thing is, Amelie's is a great concept, a 24 hour bakery/coffee shop/food spot, and they execute pretty well, so naturally they are always mobbed. The sheer magnitude of patrons cripples the net. Also, can someone please tell me why there is always some guy at a packed coffee house who thinks everyone needs to hear him play the same progression on his acoustic guitar 40 times, because I don't understand it, but Amelie's sure has one.

On the plus side, if you get stuck out in the atrium of the strip center where they have extra seating the friendly Amelieans will still bring you your food as if you were actually inside the bakery. I suggest just popping by, however, to pick up a dozen or three salted caramel brownies. Then you can take them elsewhere and eat them all in privacy while surfing the interwebs...that sounds healthy, right?"}
{"text":"A terrific product!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lines can be long!
VERY PRICEY!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in all of Charlotte. It's in a slightly awkward location, but their coffees and desserts are amazing! The salted Carmel brownies are the best!"}
{"text":"Some of the best french bread outside France."}
{"text":"I've only been to the one on Pineville-Mattews Road.  Twice.  I won't be going back.  This one is quite noisy - LOTS of little kids running around.  So if you're thinking about sipping your quiet Saturday morning latte while you read the newspaper... think again.  I waited WAY too long for my latte, and the prices are outrageously high - as with MOST Charlotte eateries.  And the pastries are just okay.  Not terrible - but definitely NOT worth the high prices they charge."}
{"text":"Had quiche for breakfast. Very moist and flavorful. The dark roast coffee was smooth with no bitterness. We returned later that night. The line was incredibly long for late night sweets. I had a delicious key lime tart. A perfect blend of sweet and citrus tart. A wonderful dessert."}
{"text":"Decided to do an update since I have recently stopped in to Amelie's.  Nothing much has changed . Even higher prices and quality has gone down.  I ordered a Pistacio Petit Gateau (sounds wonderful, right?) It was horrible. Very little cake and a thick oily \"frosting\". the cake tasted very refrigerated like more than a day and it was on the stale side. At nearly $6 dollars you should be ashamed. What a charming place but goods are mostly not worth the money."}
{"text":"24-hour places are far and few between, especially in the Bible Belt they call \"The Dirty South\". You get Waffle House, McDonalds, a handful of gas stations and Amelie's French Bakery--not to be confused with the lowbrow 24-hour options of the past.

Amelie's is heaven on earth. Despite the loooong (looooooooong) line to pick out your pastries, the whole bakery is a wonderful place to be. There are plenty of seats, bistro seating with tiny tables and tiny chairs as well as overstuffed furniture to settle into with your laptop (for the free wi-fi).

Everyone will suggest to you that you get the salted caramel brownie. And you should, if you like your caramel poured on thick with a thin layer of brownie. But rest assured: whatever you choose, you will love it all."}
{"text":"More of the same great Amelies I have come to expect in a new location much closer to my house. I have been here 3 times now and each experience has certainly met expectations. Most times have been a jump in and jump out to grab sweets to go, but the most recent was with my wife and we ended up grabbing a glass of wine in addition of the treats to go. This location has a ton of seating and the decorations certainly can keep you entertained for a while. We also have had great service here. A neat example is where my wife wanted a gluten free caramel salted brownie and the server asked if she needed to grab new gloves to prevent cross contamination. Talk about attention to detail! They are also always on point when I ask them to do a full run down of all of the macaroon flavors. The net takeaway is don't pass on Amelies if you are looking for a great dessert!"}
{"text":"Idk, it's not that great quality pastries..... And the prices make me less excited. They get a gold star for the atmosphere though."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone, nice place to grab coffee, do work and grab food. Staff is easy going, and the owner is super nice and inspiring. The Noda location is open 24/7. Great community partnership!  Thanks Amelie's!"}
{"text":"What to get: pastries, salted caramel mocha
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: cafe, study or meet up spot
Wait: 10 mins (Saturday 8PM for 1)
Parking: shared parking lot

The Experience:
It was around the end of my solo trip and though it's easy to secure a spot most places for one, Charlotte on a Saturday night gets crowded no matter where you go. At least all the well-known places do. So tired of potentially waiting for 30+ mins for even a spot at a bar, I headed over to Amelie's to have dessert for dinner.

This particular location is in a strip mall with multiple businesses, so it's a large, shared parking lot.

Biggest perk is that this place is open 24 hrs. Therefore, I can see it as a great place for studying late nights or getting together to meet up and chat with friends. To order, you'll likely line up by the counter, but it moves constantly.

A lot of their pastries looked great. I tried a fruit tart and multiple flavors of macarons. The flavors of macarons weren't posted, so I just picked based on color. The cookies are actually pretty fluffy and moist, even after a day or so. The tart was fine, but nothing particularly special.

Their salted caramel mocha latte(?) was actually the highlight for me. I'm always up for anything different they have on their coffee drinks menu and this one was well balanced. Mellow and slightly sweet, which made it easy to have with or without any treats to along with it.

Pretty cute spot and a nice haven to get away from the crowds at dinner time."}
{"text":"Amelie used to be a neat little place few years ago, but since then, it's become overrun with hipsters who are more preoccupied with instagramming their lunch than eating it. The last few times I've been in, the pastries that I've gotten were little stale and overall not great considering their high prices. 

I will still go on occasion if it's not crowded, but its not my favorite bakery anymore."}
{"text":"Amelie's is well known for it's excellent atmosphere, fun decor, free wifi and of course their delicious pastries. If you stop in here for lunch, you really do owe it yourself to try the soup. Their flavors rotate, so depending on how often you come in, there should be new ones to try. So it's hard to say which one is the best but the leek soup should not be passed by when it is offered."}
{"text":"A 24-hour French bakery in Charlotte that is actually profitable?  Yep and I'll add my two cents to the other Yelpers as to why this is....

The place is huge..it has several cozy rooms and has seating galore.  The building shares an indoor patio with adjoining businesses for bigger groups.  The decor itself is awesomely quirky.  Check out the chandelier made of eating utensils when you enter the front door.  Classic furniture and French memorabilia on the walls.  So you never fight for a seat.  Free Wi-Fi and books all over the place, as well.

The coffee is most excellent, even decaf.  That's rare when even the decaf tastes good.  I love chocolate croissants and Amelie's makes a crispy one at  that. Plus, the tarts are tres bon!  You can order a French press and they will bring you a small press for two.  Nice date idea, fellas.  The desserts are smallish (I'm American, I know) and the prices are somewhat steep for these goods.  Still, its an experience. Go for the coffee and fellowship and indulge yourself in the sweets once in a while.  Nice place to meet trendy folks in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I needed some coffee stat while traveling, and with no Starbucks in sight, I chanced upon Amelie's. The decor looked cool and the place seemed busy enough, with a somewhat long line that looked to be moving fast. At first I thought I'd get a regular drip coffee, but seeing the menu, I went for a brown butter pecan latte. It was such a good decision and turned out great - like a slice of pecan pie in a coffee cup! I still think about that drink and wish I could have it in Boston!"}
{"text":"What a great spot. Pretty busy around lunchtime with many employees taking their breaks but worth the wait. I got the salted caramel brownie and it was the perfect portion or else it would have been too much."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with Holly, got a mocha late and their famous salty carmel brownie. Holly looooved it, I like it quite a bit but wasn't overly impressed. Great location though ans cool and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I wish that I had Amelie's near me so I could visit it all the time. This would be the perfect place to read, hang out with friends, or study. The interior is gorgeous. There is also an amazing array of pastry that was very similar to the French pastries from when I studied in France. 

I tried the salted caramel brownie as recommended by others. I really liked it. It was interesting, crispy/chewy on the bottom with this delicious caramel layer on top. My friend also got one and didn't like hers at all.

All the pastries looked amazing. I would have loved to try so many more.

The service was not that friendly. I think they seemed really tired of answering the same questions over and over from people not familiar with french patisserie. Overall a great experience though."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a great place to just go and sit and chill with your best gal pals or simply by yourself as you read the latest novel or piece of fiction while indulging in a great pastry or two."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they are open 24 hours...when I went the staff was courteous as to be expected for a busy day. I ordered a chai latte which was awesome! and a croissant. I don't like the neg reviews on here, why go trying something out and then broadcasting how much you didn't like it? Seems like a waste to me, why not just go somewhere else? 
Amelie's keep doing what you are doing!

And as for the decor which has nothing to do with the food or service I like it! it fits for the NoDa area"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here. The security guard was a complete a-hole and insulted me in front of the entire place because I had my feet on the table in front of the couch I was sitting on, after I had already apologized. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Parking: I arrived at this location around 9PM at night and the parking was FULL. Very hard to find parking and when I did find parking, customers had their cars overlapped into the adjacent spot. So yeah, it aggravated me just a little. 

Inside the Cafe: First impression? Wow. This is a small place. It was genuinely busy. The line stretched all the way to the backroom. My friends and I waited about 10 minutes just to get to see the actual sweets and food. 

Menu: It's a cute menu. Hard to read when you're all the way in the back. 

Food: Expensive. Almost $2 per macaron & not a very wide selection of macarons either. I bought some sort of chocolate cake while my friends decided to get the macarons. My cake was $6-ish. It was very sweet. I didn't finish it because it was just too sweet for me to finish. The macarons that my friends bought were slightly stale. They weren't too impressed with the visit either.

It might have been just that night. I'll try again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great selection of coffee and light snacks (or heavily saccharine). Open 24/7. Good overall."}
{"text":"Love the salted caramel brownie. My wife absolutely loves their chicken salad sandwich on a croissant. It's a great place to take friends and enjoy a calm time away from the house.
All of their locations are great, but I'm personally partial to the 24-hour one in NoDa. I've spent many a night there enjoying good times with friends."}
{"text":"A place to chill with your lap top and a really fattening pastry!

Bring a book, a lap top or some friends and get in line, this place is a french bakery with a maze of tables, sitting areas, and nooks for those looking to coffee, scone, sandwich and work, talk or chill.

I think the decor goes a bit over board in some areas...  crosses the fine line between shabby chic and TGIF in a few spots, but over all - very cute and inspired.

the concept is great and the pastry is amazing! The coffee is good as well. I prefer the french press to the drip.

My faves were the sticky bun and the macaroons.. and the turkey and brie sandwich.

It can get really busy and because people linger for a long time.. sometimes it's hard to get a table, but once you are settled, it is a great alternative to a starbucks or a library for those times when you don't feel like working from home."}
{"text":"I love amelies! Every time someone comes to visit me I take them here! They always have delicious treats for everyone! Their large mousse cup is my favorite!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find on my trip to Charlotte. The perfect atmosphere mixed with an incredible menu. A new favorite place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A recent visit to my favorite patisserie has me very pleased. Amelie's now has house plates and mugs! I still like to bring my own mug because theirs are quite small.. 

There are also many more counter attendants to retrieve your delectables and help move the line along."}
{"text":"All the tasty treats I have had are delicious. Unfortunately, I rarely stay to buy something because of the line. Probably a good sign though.."}
{"text":"Amelie's is the spot here in Charlotte. From the cool paintings and sculptures inside to delicious salted Carmel brownie and (my fav) Chia Latte Creme I always end up here at the end of the night with a friend to catch up. The lines are always long but they go by quickly. If you haven't been, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely darling! Delicious little pastries and breakfast items. A fun place to take visitors!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and the best pastries in Charlotte. I prefer the Amelie's on RT 51 and for that Amelie's I would rate it  five stars. Their breakfast sandwich is excellent and so are their other ones - try the pate or roast beef sandwich. If you ever need a cake for a special occasion you can't beat ordering it from them."}
{"text":"Tried their new place last week and it is just as good as their NoDa place. The only nit pick I have is that to get your one free refill of coffee at their Carmel place you need to get back in line for someone behind the counter to refill your cup. Small price to pay for some of the best pastries and bread in Charlotte. Their coffee is also excellent. Great place for a breakfast sandwich or a light lunch sandwich (great pate) or soup."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first trip to Amelie's. I studied abroad in France so I am a sucker for authentic French food. You order dessert  first so I got their salted caramel brownie. For lunch I had their pâté de campagne sandwich and asparagus leek soup. The pate was amazing. It had a nice bite and the pickles were the perfect match to the richness of the pate. The bread was amazing. The soup was ok. A tad too thin and salty. The best part was they served it with more bread. The brownies was really yummy. It was super fudgey and the salted caramel was tasty. I love the ambiance of the bakery. The vintage french vibe was cool. I would come back here again if I was in NoDa."}
{"text":"First time visited tonight. Great selections, great tasting. My reaction was  WOW!!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Never have I ever been to a cafe` where the line wraps around it like this one. The food is great, the atmosphere is bomb and the whole vibe is creatively eclectic, inspiring, relaxing and homey!!! Love Amelie's, it is definitely worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you love working on your homework, laptop, reading a book, or hanging out with your friends till 6am drinking coffee and eating deliciously hand crafted patties and goodies! It's my favorite hang out spot to get work done and relax. I'd live here if I could. The food is pretty darn awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great eclectic vibe with a busy mix of tourists and business professionals eating and enjoying coffee. Plenty of room to find a well lit corner on one of 3 floors. A mix of popular classical and various rock filled the space. My vanilla latte was well balanced and - thankfully - less sweat than your standard Starbucks. I enjoyed some Pain Perdu and my latte for $9. Tasted great. I'll be visiting again before I leave Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you thought the NoDa location was cute, this one may be even cuter! I have been here multiple times and always notice something new. Wine is good, coffee is good, food is good. Service great too! Seriously, this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I've been twice, Saturday before 9 and Sunday around 11.  There's a bit of a line, but they try and keep it moving.  Pastry is what you want from a good bakery.  Their pumpkin with cream cheese filling is so delicious.  The salted caramel brownie was good after being in my fridge for two days (it hid on me!).  The apple turnover is flaky and tasty too.  I really appreciate this place having just moved to Charlotte a few months ago."}
{"text":"Have you really been to Charlotte if you haven't been to AMELIE'S?! Amelie's sits perfectly into NoDa and is a definitive part of Charlotte's Art District. Walking in, you are welcomed with friendly staff and tons of quirky decor. Mismatched furniture adds to its fun vibes and makes an overall welcoming and great place to hang out, relax, or get some work done. 

Of course, the desserts and other edibles and drinks are always a delight and the vast arrangement is extremely pleasing to the eye and will make you want to buy more desserts than your body could take. The macarons are always a classic and I have bought tons for a party before and they are definitely a crowd pleaser! The salted caramel brownie is a classic favorite and one of my new favorites. The tarts are amazing and the espresso cake has the perfect dash of coffee. They also make cakes when you need one for a big event and the prices aren't too bad! 

If you haven't been to Amelie's and you live in the Charlotte area or you are visiting and don't know where to go, well girllllllll (and guys), this is it!"}
{"text":"Never again! My wife and I love French bakeries and it's always been our day date option after dropping kiddos off at school. We just moved to the area a few months ago and decided to start our day date tradition back up again now that we're all settled. Since I'm originally from the area, I knew of Amelie's so we made it the first stop. Huge mistake. The server was rude and couldn't have cared less about customer service. I asked for an iced version of one of their coffees and she refused completely. I asked for the regular version and a cup of ice but no luck so i settled for water. We ordered a creme brûlée and they didn't want to torch it so we had to talk them into it and I wish they would've let us do it because it wasn't done right. The other pastries were okay, nothing great but nothing terrible and my wife was satisfied with her coffee. 
I've never been in a coffee shop that made me say \"we should've just gone to Starbucks\" until today. At least their staff tries to help you find something close to what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I love this new location! A lot of tables and nooks to study and write. The staff is always friendly and I am really happy this location is in uptown!"}
{"text":"I've been longing for a place like Amelie's French Bakery. Strong wifi, perfect and cool temp, comfortable and cozy atmosphere, delicious and I mean DELICIOUS coffee and so many treats to choose from! And be still my heart it's open 24 HOURS! Do you know how rare that is here in Charlotte? I want to stress once more the coffee is the best! Even the dark roast is smooth and not overwhelming. 

I would have given it 5 star if coffee refills were not 99 cents. Should be 50 cents given the current state of the economy. Yes, I know the first one is free but I stand by what I say!"}
{"text":"This is great place to pick up dessert after dinner. The place had a long line but well worth it. Variety and flavor choices were great."}
{"text":"Incredible place to relax or get work down or read.  Amazing baked goods and coffee.  I had lunch here as well before and it also was top notch"}
{"text":"Amelie's is the kind of place that you're still surprised to find in Charlotte. (We're cooler now than we've ever been with our craft beer and our trendy 'hoods, but Amelie's is still a standout that makes you say, \"Whoa. We're THAT cool? Really?\" The main location is open 24 hours and every ounce of its staff and decor oozes hipster cool. But it's the pastries that keep people coming back. (They're so good it wouldn't matter if they were served in a bunker. As it is, you'll get to enjoy tasty pastries paired with deliciously quirky ambiance.)

You can't go wrong. The salted caramel brownies are a known, rich favorite. The Napoleon can't be beat. Their tarts are delectable. Their macaron selection renowned. I recently brought an old friend from college by for the first time. She's an art history professor who travels the world. She not only got a huge kick out of the decor's riffs on classic masterpieces, but she said the macaron she had was one of the best she's had - worldwide - and well worth the line. 

Prices aren't cheap if you're looking to load up and buy a box or two of treats, but cheap isn't what you're here for anyway. The NoDa location can feel a little dirty, as noted in another review, but I imagine that's par for the course with anything that's open 24 hours. There can be a wait, but it moves quickly and is worth it. I haven't had lunch here, but often salivate over their Facebook soup of the day posts. Swing on by, bring an out-of-towner or two to show just how cool the QC is, and respect the pastries because holy moly they're delish."}
{"text":"The only downside is the long wait but maybe that's because a convention was in town. Oh god the bakery...get the salted caramel brownie! And the s'mores macaroon and the petite four. Ask the staff for their recommendations, they know what's great! And definitely get the lavender lemonade. Russian tea was also excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome pastries and very nice decor, look up the ceiling and you will be amazed. The cakes and cupcakes are very good."}
{"text":"So happy there is a location on my side of town near Ballantyne.  Love everything... the food, the pastries, drinks, décor and the friendly service.  Just an adorable place and a fun event each time I visit."}
{"text":"So happy there is a location on my side of town near Ballantyne. Love  everything !! the food, the pastries, the drinks, the décor, the friendly service.  Just an adorable fun and entertaining event each time I visit.  Love this place !"}
{"text":"Cute French cafe with outstanding homemade soups and sandwiches.  I enjoyed the spinach asparagus leek soup and turkey brie raspberry sandwich.  A great lunch combo for a rainy December day!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something sweet! They have a variety of goodies on display. I chose a chocolate cake, which was surprisingly light - not heavy or rich. It was covered with chocolate ganache. So good! I also got a cinnamon flavored macaroon with a chocolate ganache, it was a little crispy on the outside and chewy and moist on the inside. I also got a raspberry mousse, dark chocolate mini pot. A small sized yummy treat. To drink, a friend recommended the lavender lemonade. It was delicious, really light and sweet with the lavender flavor. A must try place!"}
{"text":"This place stays busy but understandly so. Although the crowds can get big the self is always respectful and pleasant. I've had most of their pastries and have never been disappointed. They drip coffee is also fresh and a good find. The people who come are just as entertaining as overall atmosphere Amelie's fosters. Its a great place for a friend date, studying and casual meetups."}
{"text":"I've dined here multiple times for lunch (either dine in or take out) and always have found my experience to be rated as a solid 4 stars. Today, I dined in and ordered the mango, crispy prosciutto and mango salad with chicken and candied orange + lavender cafe soda. 

In regard to my beverage, the woman behind the counter had little knowledge about the drink besides that it was strong (had a shot of espresso in it, in addition to lavender simple syrup, orange juice, sparkling water and candied orange peel). As you can tell by the ingredients, I was perplexed as to how this would taste. Surprisingly, it was not too sweet and had a strong coffee taste with a hint of orange. I did not taste lavender, but maybe my taste sense was off today?! Anyway- I do recommend trying this at least once...not sure how long it will be around as it's on the summer drink menu.

The salad did not have the best visual appearance but was quite delicious. I loved the passion fruit vinaigrette and how the different ingredients melded together. Thin strips of mango and jicama, pineapple and crispy prosciutto...made for a delicious salad. 

You can never go wrong though with a croissant sandwich or their soups. And as others have noted, the salted caramel brownie is the absolute best dessert here. Do not leave without one in your hand!"}
{"text":"The pastries here are delicious! During my trip to Charlotte I was lucky enough to come here twice.

Tried the passionfruit cake, opera torte, apple/apricot turnover, peppermint creme brulee, salted caramel macaron, and chocolate eclair. Everything here was amazing but the stand outs were the passionfruit cake and peppermint creme brulee. The passionfruit cake was so light- not overly sweet- and the frosting is probably the creamiest I've ever had. The peppermint creme brulee had just amount of peppermint, not overpowering at all. Plus, they heat the surface to order.

I was told the chicken salad sandwich was a must have and it lived up to the hype. The house dijon is so flavorful and they give you a very generous amount of chicken.

Love this place! Will be back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So many amazing gluten free options -- from breakfast sandwiches to delicious desserts. Everything was amazing and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"My family and I did not have a good experience at this Amélie's and I was all set to give a one star rating. However, the manager eventually gave us a gift card to make it right so I'll go up to a 3 star. I appreciate the gesture but they do still need to work on their customer service big time. The  food is good (same menu as the other Amélie's locations) but the service is not up to par with the NoDa location.

The trouble started when they got my mom's order wrong. In and of itself this isn't a big deal, but then they took forever to fix it. It wasn't all that crowded when we went and it shouldn't take twenty minutes to remake a roast beef sandwich especially when you've already messed up the first sandwich. My mom actually had to go up to the register after about fifteen minutes had passed to ask where her sandwich was so there's a distinct possibility that it would've taken even longer had she not made her presence known. When the manager eventually got around to getting her the sandwich, she didn't really offer an explanation as to why it took so long and she didn't even really apologize until my normally mild mannered mom started fussing. My mom pointed out that we should get some kind of discount for the inconvenience and the 'manager' just ignored her. Awkward. I understand that sometimes there are rules about giving discounts and maybe she wasn't able to but if that's the case, she should've said something like 'I'm sorry but we can't do that' instead of just ignoring a customer. We did eventually get a gift card but that was later after a second mistake. She was extremely unprofessional and didn't seem like she should be in a management role.

The trouble continued when I got a to go order of one of their spreads. Once again, they got the order wrong (I should've checked it but I didn't expect our order to be wrong TWICE). When we realized that another mistake had been made (after getting all the way back home), we called and complained. When I went to pick up my fixed order, we were given a 30 dollar gift card, a few coupons for salted caramel brownies and an extra spread. This basically meant our meal was completely comped and I do appreciate that but I still feel like I can't go higher than a 3 because it took a whole lot of fussing and multiple mistakes for them to finally make it right. Also, the manager that gave us the gift cards was not the same person as the original 'manager' we dealt with. I guess it's possible that they had two on duty but that seems odd since this location isn't that busy. I suspect that the first person may have lied about being a manager (both because of her lack of professionalism and my skepticism about the need for having two on duty).

TLDR-the lines here are much shorter than at the NoDa location but the poor service makes the experience less pleasant. Just go to the NoDa location during off peak hours!"}
{"text":"This is a unique place that feels like home which my husband did not like.   The food is very good and the pastries are delicious."}
{"text":"Pastries are delicious but the place is pretty dirty I'm afraid to touch anything. I like the one in SC more. It's exponentially cleaner. Nonetheless by far the best pastries in town!!"}
{"text":"Amazing variety of pastries, breakfast, and lunch options. The sandwiches show a delicious twist on the norm. My only disappoints were finding a place to sit, and how early they ran out of the quiche of the day."}
{"text":"A MUST stop in Charlotte! This cafe represents the chic and classy side of the city. You can see the bakers making fresh pastries and other delicious delicacies for the shop. 

In addition to the macaroons, tea cakes, and sweets, I absolutely love the beverages here! Try the limonade, any flavor would be great and refreshing :) I also tried the winter special coffee latte and loved it. 

If you go with a group of people, it's a great place to hang out. Walk around to check out all the amazing decors (very Frenchy) and perfect spots for Instagram/Facebook posts ;)"}
{"text":"Ambiance is really nice, I could spend an hour here just looking around. Macaroon just melts in your mouth, delicious. Line for pastries was long, probably 15 minutes, but drink line just took a few minutes. Drinks were ok, but pastries is the reason to come."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in a different world when I come here. Nice selection of deserts, drinks and coffee."}
{"text":"The ability to hangout with friends in a unique environment encourages creativity. I love the convenience of this location(makes me a regular). 
They recently opened more space to meet with friends.
A must to new people in Charlotte.
FYI they are open late, but expect a line for their delicious treats. I am a fan of their ice cream."}
{"text":"A very cute French atmosphere with good locations including one right in uptown. There are a lot of areas to go to, with a downstairs and an upstairs, not always easy to find a table depending what time you go.
For drinks, their fresh squeezed orange juice is incredible and their Chai lattes and espresso are good too. 
As for food, their pastries are good but their cake-ier items can be dry and they have hard macarons."}
{"text":"Salted caramel brownies are my wife's favorite. I love their creme brulee- especially their mocha or coffee flavored. The ambiance is amazing for dates or just hanging out with friends. If you need a coffee shop to work in they have free wi-fi and lots of electrical outlets!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Amelie's I find something new to love! Totally worth cheating on my low carb diet!"}
{"text":"Yummmm. Go here. You won't regret it. It's worth the long wait in line."}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte for authentic and delectable French treats!!! Make sure to get some macaroons!"}
{"text":"Love the decor it's very boho just my style but the Napoleon that I ordered was a bit stale. I have to go back and try something else because it was like 1 am on a Friday so maybe the bakery wasn't really ready. I really wanted to try out their salted Carmel brownies but they were all out :("}
{"text":"They are open 24/7  365 days ... @ this location --open every day .all year long!  That is not a typo.

All the pastries and desserts tasted very fresh as we witnessed them coming out regularly.
Obviously depending on what your tastes are ...       I don't think you can go wrong

All the fruits were fresh and the custards and creams appeared creamy and recently made

You can get coffee tea and drinks and lunch sandwiches also.

It is worth another trip and apparently other locations are in NC, Rock hill, SC and Atlanta"}
{"text":"This is the best place for any and all desserts!  I would highly recommend the salted caramel brownie, and if you want something similar but not the brownie, the salted caramel tort is AMAZING as well!"}
{"text":"Stale, semi-frozen cake... uhhhh? Really?  This is what people have been raving about?

The macaron are tasty.  A couple of the tarts were passable, although the crusts were very tough and too chewy.  Soup is good.

Go for the atmosphere, but don't go hungry."}
{"text":"The best dessert place in town. I was always satisfied with their amazing choice of menu and the taste. The ambience is perfect and the best part - it is open 24 hrs. When I'm hungry at middle of night I would head out to Amelie's."}
{"text":"A stunning, MASSIVE space located right in the heart of uptown. Coming from Chicago, I couldn't believe how cheap Amelie's desserts were! I really had to fight the urge to grab multiples of everything in the display case. Especially when they're offering different free samples every day, you KNOW how good everything tastes and it gets harder and harder to choose. 

Everything from the macarons to the eclairs, petit fours to mousse was top notch. It was a definite repeat visit for us on our short three day trip! It was even BF-approved, and he's not a big dessert guy. Mouthwateringly great.

Pro-Tip: DON'T MISS THE SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIE (which also comes in macaron form, too!)"}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard about Amelie's-hoping Charlotte finally got a good, European-style bakery.

So I went there a few days ago for lunch with a friend. Was mesmerized by the display case of tarts, eclairs, croissants, pains au chocolate, and a few cakes. The employee at the counter told us they also had lunch available, so we decided to stay for lunch. The sandwiches-a roast beef sandwich and a Croque-monsieur-were good. The CM actually was awesome. But 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas cost around $17, if I remember correctly.

We got some sweets to go-one large Napoleon and a chocolate croissant. I I should have known by the dark brown color of the pastry that the Napoleon was over baked, but I went ahead and got it. And tasting it I knew that the pastry was definitely way overcooked and the filling could not overcome that over-baked flavor. I suspect the baker must have been Prussian and didn't care for the namesake of this dessert,  because everything else in the case looked good.

The pain au chocolate (which I saved for breakfast the next morning) was good too.

I honestly am more of a cake person, so I may go back to try one or two of the cake-y items they have, and the tarts look good too.

I left with an overall good impression (any 24-hour bakery gets high marks in my book). The prices also seemed a bit high, but perhaps I am just used to my local latino bakery, where everything seems ridiculously cheap. Definitely a good place to get something different, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was also promised a gift card for my troubles over 4 weeks ago. Guess what never showed up? Par for the course, I guess."}
{"text":"My favorite getaway in Charlotte at all times of the day! It is such a great place to sit back, relax & enjoy scrumptious desserts, teas and coffee! And I am sure I'm not the only one who thinks this especially when you enter at 11 pm and the place is still full of guest enjoying their company. The staff is wonderful! They are willing to help you with your choices so if you can't decide what you want, ask them for help! 

My must gets are: 
Salted Carmel Brownie: this decadent desert is full of flavor and salt balances out the sweetness so perfectly. The gluten free ones are just as delicious.
Yellow and Blue Herbal Tea \"The Au Lait\" style: this one I will grab when it's late night and I'm going straight to bed after wards. It's a mixture of chamomile, lavender and other ingredients and the milk and honey tops it off so well. (It's a weird combo but I love it!) 
Cafe Marcotter: this is Amelie's Signature and the flavors are perfect together! 

The dessert case is always full of other desserts that we will pick from so don't forget to check those out as well."}
{"text":"The best French cafe! A bit like Moulin in Newport Beach, CA.
Even though it's hugeness with lots of tables, not easy to find a table at the prime time. We went 3 times while we were in Charlotte, sat twice downstairs, one at the corner of upstairs. For three times ilsa had BLT, ilan his croissant with gruyere cheese and I had ham, tomato and brie with cappuccino. All was super tasty!
Great place."}
{"text":"What a darling venue.  It is very Fraunshhhh inside.  I like the lighting and the wall decor.  The way they decorated actually kinda makes me think of the movie \"Amalie\" (although maybe I just made that up in my head because of the name).  

So I had the \"Marie Antoinette\" which was a cream cheese pastry with a raspberry jam on top.  Rich, but not too sweet.  I also had a ham and gruyere tartine, which was very savory.  Both of these I got to-go, because I had just eaten lunch and I wasn't sure if I'd feel like getting out of my comfy hotel bed later on.  (I was right. Future me was grateful.)  

I must have arrived right before the lunch rush.  It got bussssssy fast, like right after I got my food.  Good timing."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! All of the food,
beverages and environment is great. I tried the white bean and ham soup for the first time tonight and it was TO DIE FOR. My new favorite."}
{"text":"Chocolate croissant is to die for. I had the Thai chai creme with it and loved the combo! The bakery has a very charming atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I love the food, drinks, and atmosphere. Anytime my friends or family come to visit, I always bring them to try it."}
{"text":"Stop looking- just go straight here!! Such a cute place!! All of the staff was super friendly and accommodating! I loved it so much that I went for lunch and then breakfast the next day. The province BLT was soo yummy especially with the fruit salad side. When the sign says they've sold over 110,000 salted caramel brownies- how can you not try one?? I wasn't disappointed! It was awesome. The pastry selection was vast and left me struggling on what to get because everything looks so good!! A friend had a few mini tarts that were really good and my daughter enjoyed her orange macaron. The lemonade classique depends on who makes it- yesterday's was better than today's but I would still get it again. For breakfast, I had egg, cheddar, tomato & spinach on a baguette! Wow! Basically, my favorite breakfast. I wish they would open one in Raleigh so I could enjoy it more often!! If you are at a convention- go here for sure since I know convention center food usually sucks. But if you work in the area- beware you could find yourself here multiple times a week!!! The ample outdoor seating is perfectly shaded to keep you cool on a hot Charlotte day. I can't wait to get back here!!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is all it is cracked up to be.  I have had multiple pastries from here and I personally wouldn't recommend it but others I have been with like it"}
{"text":"If I lived in the area, I would be at Amelie's all the time!
The chocolate mousse cup is the largest I have ever seen (the size of a big cupcake)!  The cappuccino was great and the tartine (with pimento cheese, tomato and basil) and the spinach leek soup was well-balanced and perfectly seasoned.
The decor is fun and eclectic.  It was very busy-- since I went on a Saturday in the early afternoon, but the dining room was ample enough to accommodate everyone.  I would like to go back on a weekday morning to try some of their breakfast options."}
{"text":"Came in for an after dinner treat. This place rocks! They have so many desserts that look good here that you can go broke! We had the salted caramel brownie torte and a slice of white chocolate strawberry cake heaven! The coffee looks amazing too but I just couldn't get one so late at night . Oh well, maybe next time. P.S. The decor here is so cute. Look for the upside down tree.(can you spot it?)"}
{"text":"A trip to Amelie's is always a necessity whenever I'm in Charlotte. It's conveniently open 24/7, has a very artsy feel/cozy setting and has a never-ending (ok, maybe I'm over-exaggerating, but you get my point) variety of sweets to try. I've heard everything at Amelie's is overpriced (I won't argue that), but the location and ambiance of the place still keeps dragging me back. Even the long lines that curve all the way to the back of the store sometimes doesn't stop people from coming in. 

I ALWAYS get the salted caramel brownie when I go. It's heaven in a rectangular slab. Lately, I've also been trying the macarons. So far I've tried the salted caramel (tan brown), strawberry-something (pink), and pistachio (obnoxious green) macarons. The pistachio is my favorite! 

Besides the food, I'm not really a big fan of Amelie's drinks. I have yet to find something that I really like."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte on a trip to North Calorina, and checked out Yelp for a nice fresh lunch venue, and found Amelie's. It's a quaint, casual, little restaurant with a nice selection of sandwiches, soups, and beautiful pastries. I had a Chicken Croissant Sandwich, a cup of delicious Potato Spinach Leek Soup, and a lovely glass of Lavender Lemonade (which was my favorite part). I so enjoyed it all. I'd highly recommend Amelie's."}
{"text":"Food is quite good.... So why only two stars? The management is so pretensions. When my daughter and I circled the room two times with plates and drink in hand and couldn't find anywhere to sit I asked the management if they were going to open the room that was roped off since they were so busy. I didn't understand that it was a private rental only space. There were no signs. Her response was \"Well it is normally rented for 100$ an hour but I guess since you need someplace to sit we will open it just for YOU.\" ----- Seriously?!?!

And they are constantly in the news for their horrible practices in dealing with the back of the house employees. Like requiring them to work 60 hrs a week but having them clock out after 40 and then back in under another title so that they won't have to pay time and a half. I have spoken with some x employees that have confirmed that and worse. 

So the food is decent though crazy expensive and the ambiance is frilly and french. But don't think that you are supporting a positive local business. I can do without the salted caramel brownies to sleep better at night"}
{"text":"Amélie's has always been my go to when it comes to my favorite sweet treats anytime of the day. I've also have had their sandwiches and yummy drinks! The service is usually friendly as they try to assist you and yet move you along. I went last night and was slightly disappointed. I ordered a couple of items, including the bread pudding which i was told takes 13 minutes, which i get every time so that was no issue. I also ordered a key lime pie which was perfect! Also a chocolate croissant ,which i usually Love, was a lot less chocolate than usual and in my opinion was toasted too long. 
We started eating the pie and croissant as we waited for the bread pudding. 20 minutes go by and nothing. My husband went to the counter and asked about it and was told that it is on its way. 25 more minutes go by and finally it arrived. I don't know if they forgot about it or what but 45 minutes for a little thing of bread pudding was ridiculous! Luckily it was delicious but not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"They are way over priced. Sorry people, hate to bust your bubble, but I've had better and not for this price. $36.00 on a few pastries is insane!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Amelies is more open but still has the cozy cafe vibe.  Interesting chandeliers, tantalising aromas yummy pastries and wine that I have yet to try.  But try, I must with a baguette and soup. The outdoor seating is very nice."}
{"text":"The coffee and pastries here are AWESOME!!! And the best part is -- you can get them of all hours of the day, and night ;)"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get with a friend, have a cup of coffee, and play a little chess on a Saturday morning/afternoon. The staff is always vibrant and the scene is exactly the way I like it. I usually don't eat when I go there but the Neapolitan is really good. As well as their croissants"}
{"text":"what can I say?? I love this place!!!!! their pastries and breakfast are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Thee worst customer service... Okay not the worse but it was kind of up there. I had my lips tooted for a brownie. TOOTED! I just wanted a regular brownie and I don't know what I was thinking cuz I know they don't have them at the NODA location, so why would they have them here... but it's all good. I know they have the caramel brownies which my husband loves and purchased 3 of them as usual. 

Okay on to the disservice. We walk in and we're the only ones at the counter. A young girl and guy are talking and don't even bother to acknowledge us. I guess once we get closer to look like we're about to order something they're standing in front of us still talking. I guess the young girl is ready to take our order as she just looks at us. No \"hi\". No \"how can I help you? No \"what do you want?, so I just start ordering. Now normally I would just leave but I could not for the life of me think of a place to buy a single brownie... Just one. 

So I ordered one of the triple chocolate layered joints and a macaroon. Figured I get something cuz my dude was not deterred by the service. Nothing was going to get in the way of him and a caramel brownie. 

Get to the register and the dude says nothing. Just rings up our order. I mean do these people get tips? They can't be. They're horrible. It's like they dropped off the leftovers from the NODA spot which I've never had any semblance of an issue at that location. Anywho my dude comments on the horrible service once we left. I guess he may go back because he can't part with his precious caramel brownie. I think I can convince him not to.I'm not giving my money to a place where a person can't say one simple word \"hi\" to me. We figure we'll just venture over to the other spot. It's closer to our jobs anyway. 

FYI: I gots my brownie at the Fresh Market right down the street. Bonus: I got a lemon bar too. How were they? SLAMMIN!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  The decor is eclectic, the clientele is eclectic and the line out the door is the tell-tell sign that you are in the right place.

Our good friends met us here and we stood in line a while to have the tastiest treats.  I had the roast beef croissant with cheddar and horseradish sauce.  I had a pot du creme for dessert and I swear it was the best ever.

Think quaint french bakery merged with metropolitan dive with a twist of NODA.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"ECCENTRIC FRENCH

There is a reason the line is out the door.  This place is the place to be for great desserts, savory fillings and great beverages.

The eccentric decor adds to the ambience and gives you things to look at while you are in line.  The line is long, but goes quickly.  Keep going in the back they have more seating than you think.

My daughter enjoyed her eclair while I had the pot of chocolate. She had the turkey and bacon.  I had roast beef and monchego.  We brought home pastries for breakfast.  Great value. Wonderful quality."}
{"text":"I became a fan of Amelie's after my friend Charles, from Bordeaux, France introduced me.  I've gotten to know Bill Lamb, one of the owners, and have visited Cafe des Deux Moulin's, where the film Amelie was filmed in Paris.  So, this new place was a little challenging to accept when she first opened.  

She reminds of the NoDa original but now she's all grown up.  The Myers Park location is in the Back Lot of Park Road Shopping Center.  Lexus, Mercedes, and Land Rover grace the lot instead of working vans, VW's, and transients.  The place teams with kids and dogs on the weekends.  It is very nice, but somehow not the same.

It was like when I fell in love with this cute girl in high school who would skip school with me, skied with me in Vermont, and wore halter tops and very short cut-offs in the summer.  Now, she returns after graduating from college with her master's degree.  She's the same girl underneath, but no longer a child: refined, elegant, and confident--like a bottle of wine from Bordeaux.  And she's here to stay, serving rich pastries, deep coffee, and flavorful soups and sandwiches--just like NoDa--but with her delicate touch of maturity.  

So, why only 4 stars?  I'm still in love with my high school sweetheart--she's a 5 in my book!  Bon appetit, Amelie!"}
{"text":"The Salted Caramel Brownies were the best thing that's ever been in my mouth.

Chocolate Croissants. 
Macaroons. 
Mini tarts.

I ate it all.  

I want to live here.  Inside the store.  And never leave until I'm so big they have to tear down a wall to get me out.  I didn't meet Amélie, but I want to marry her.  

This is BY FAR the best bakery I've ever been in."}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's greatest bakeries with an overall amazing experience. It's different but beautiful. Pastries are delicious and when you're craving something at the wierd hours of the night they are OPEN!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!! Breakfast sandwiches were amazing. The vanilla salted caramel latte was OUTSTANDING.  Cream puffs & cake were delicious. Atmosphere was very comfortable. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets in Charlotte.  We found this place serendipitously, and WOW!

My wife and I have been to France, and while you'd be hard pressed to find the equivalent in the US, Amelie's does a fantastic job and we have no complaints.

Try the breakfast sandwiches, croissant with gruyere and bacon is my fave.  The Monkey Bread is amazing.  Wife loves the coffee and the various pastries are as good as you're going to find in NC.

Give the place a shot, you won't be disappointed.  Try off-peak hours if you're concerned about waiting for your food.  We've never had a problem, but I see some people complain about that."}
{"text":"This bakery has become a weekly visit for me. Absolutely love the atmosphere, very retro and quaint at the same time. I usually go around 10-11am so there's not a line. They are known for their salted caramel brownie bars, so if you go...make sure to order one! I stick with the gluten-free one since it's a little healthier and the taste is no different than their classic. Seating is accommodating for groups of people or people like myself who go alone to enjoy some quiet alone time with a latte and pastry.
Other yummy options are their berry salad, liver pate on a baguette sandwich, and their BLT croissant. Highly suggest! 

Oh and they're apparently open 24/7!"}
{"text":"I got a take out coffee -- sipped it and it was so burning hot I reflexively spat it out on the counter. The barista saw and heard me exclaim how hot it was, but just left me, embarrassed, to clean up. Two hours later and my tongue still hurts and is bleeding in one small place. If you insist on making take out coffee hot enough to scald with even a tiny sip please don't fill the cups to overflowing and do warn the customer to give it 5-10 mins. Meanwhile the Napolean I got at the same time was frozen on the middle."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love overpriced baked goods and mediocre coffee?! These places are all pretty equal in terms of service, quality of food, and witnessing way too many people on laptops at odd hours of the day (do you guys not pay for internet at home?). They have an interesting spread with some items being notably delicious (I.e. the salted caramel brownie and their muffins). 

Prices are pretty steep for some things. I walked out $15 poorer with a brownie, a muffin, and cup of black coffee. Maybe some things are worth going often for, but I have yet to discover those. 3/5 as I have yet to have anything that's just mind blowing and the service is fair."}
{"text":"Amelie's is about as close to a French bakery as you'll find within 100 miles.   Their food is fresh,  enticing, and delicious.   The NoDa location is the original,  complete with 24 hour service and a bohemian vibe.  This funky place that will have you wishing bon voyage to Paris!"}
{"text":"Heeyyy - love to see another one of these pop up! 
I was a regular back when Noda was the only spot, now there is one closer to me :)
They have everything you would expect from Amelies - funky décor and great dessert/coffee.
Drumroll...they have beer and wine. WONDERFUL! Whats even better, you still get the laid back, coffee shop vibe. They did a great job not turning it into a \"bar\". 
I will be back - if you have not tried an Amelies in the Charlotte area, there are a few around town. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like this place? There is no way that this place deserves anything less than 5 stars. Awesome bakery items and the soups and sandwiches are perfecto. I LOVE that this place is open 24 hours a day, not sure exactly why that is, but I don't care or question it. I recently came here with 14 other gals and quickly found out that groups need to be approved by management. We ended up sitting outside the restraurant in the breezeway which was fine with us, but good to know for the future. Awesome place to take friends who are visiting from out of town which is what I'll be doing this coming weekend."}
{"text":"So So So So Good!

The long line at any given time of day is annoying but shows how good this place is.  

Yum!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and baked goods. Also a nice place to get some work done outside of the office."}
{"text":"What a quirky place! Whether you are looking for some lunch, just a dessert, a place to study, a place to chat... This is the place for you. There are so many different kinds of seating areas- small tables, couches, comfy chairs, big tables- you could have a variety of experiences. We came for lunch and a bite of dessert and it took us 10 minutes to decide because everything looked so delicious. I have never been to a place with a table tracker before, it was pretty neat that we could seat ourselves wherever and someone found our table with the tracker to bring our food to us."}
{"text":"Best macaroons EVER. Love this place. Haven't been back since the management changed a while back but it is still my favorite for it's lavender macaroons. 

Ps. Will have to pop by one of these days."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and turnovers."}
{"text":"The turnovers!!!"}
{"text":"Y'all. I love this place. Macarons are my love language + theirs are the best I've found in the state of North Carolina. Amelie's is good for a quick bite for lunch or coffee + dessert. Super casual atmosphere with some French touches."}
{"text":"Decor is cute, drinks are okay, desserts are average. I can't speak on the quality of the cafe food, but I felt that the desserts are definitely overrated. I tried several different things at several different visits, and nothing was phenomenal. The macaroons were especially a disappointment as the  shell was very grainy and honestly the whole thing tasted somewhat stale. I have also tried the eclair, which also tasted a little dry. It's a cute atmosphere to do work in or chat with friends, but in my opinion, there are much better desserts."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The decoration personally creeps me out. It's very hodge podge and the fact that it's open 24/7 makes me wonder who has slept in the chair I'm sitting on."}
{"text":"The best Salted Carmel Brownie ever!  I'm so glad I found the recipe to make too.  Their cakes are always a fun surprise.  I never know which ones they'll have available.  My favorites are the pistachio and the cappuccino  but if they are on the daily selection I must get there too late.  Thank goodness for the little Cappuccino Candy cup to satisfy that craving.  Wonderful Place, quirky environment and great food!"}
{"text":"Came into Amelie's around 8 am with a slow crowd ordered 3 quiche to go. I waited about 10-15 min for them to be heated and upon delivery 1 was served with a dark brown burnt top.    I returned the burnt quiche and proceeded to wait an additional 10 min. As a restaurant industry vet it's highly disappointing to see that type of neglect when there are 3 customers in the cafe. Will only be returning if I have 40 min to spare."}
{"text":"Most excellent bakery. Opened 24/7 for anyone's convenience and great location to sit relax and chill with a cup of coffee and some sweet treats! Great unique artistic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing. There is so much space to sit and hang out. The coffee has crazy French names but is delicious. Then the pastries are all delicious - gluten free Carmel brownie is the way to go!"}
{"text":"This was on my list of \"must hit\" places during our very short stay in Charlotte, so despite the fact that it was pouring rain, we took a bus from uptown to get there.  Arrived around 10:15 on Saturday morning only to learn that...gasp...they had no almond croissants.  MAJOR bummer.  Decided to try an apple turnover, which was pretty mediocre, and got a cheese danish and chocolate & almond croissant to share the next morning.  The cheese danish was decent, not great, and the croissant was excellent.  If we had only ordered the chocolate & almond croissant, I would most likely be giving a 4-star rating.  Maybe there are other \"wow\" items that we just didn't select...not sure...or maybe we're spoiled having been to Paris & other excellent French bakeries in the States."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!  I have never had a more flaky croissant in my life.  The danish was out of this world.  I will gladly drive an hour and a half for these pastries!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place.  And it is open 24 hours!  I wish I could exclusively support businesses that are open 24 hours but that would reduce me to Amelie's and the Waffle House, so I've got to be realistic.  But, at the very least, I try to throw as much support to Amelie's as I can.

Despite what some other reviewers have said, I love the decor here.  It is cleverly done vintage/DIY/Shabby Chic, and it works.  It has lots of different rooms, each with their own feel.  You can decide if you want to be in a quiet study room, a quiet conversation room, an atrium or the bustling business end.  Fantastic.  I have been this place quite a few times, too, and have always had excellent service, so not sure what these other gripes are about.  It does get busy at peak hours (weekend afternoons), so take that into consideration.  But, of course, you can always go at 2am, as well :)

And the food is great, too.  I highly recommend the Napoleons, tea cakes, salted caramel brownies, twice-baked croissants, hot chocolate, their soups and the breakfast egg sandwiches.  Also, I often stop by to get a frozen baguette which you can pop in the oven and eat at your leisure later on.  

My only nits are that I think their prices are a bit high, and I don't love their vanilla strawberry minicake (too much icing that needed to be served at room temperature (not chilled) and not enough strawberries and delicious cake).  These minor issues though, do nothing to detract from the overall awesomeness of this place."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Amelie's! This is my boyfriend and my's \"go-to\" place for just about any occasion/mood/craving. I am a coffee and eclair-a-holic, so it seems like this place was made for me! The atmosphere is too cute and I love how much space they have. Totally worth the line that sometimes wraps around the doorway. The staff there know their stuff, so I have never waited more than 10-15 minutes for my caffeine/sugar fix."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place for grabbing a quick breakfast or lunch! The decor is so cool, you want to just sit and look around while you enjoy your Salted Caramel Latte and Big Blueberry Muffin with cream cheese!"}
{"text":"The Neopolitan - simply phenomenal. A little surprised at the toughness of the top layer. Breaking through with a fork resulted in largely collapsing the structure, expelling the filling out all sides. The top layer is really the key to the flavor profile, but the filling provides a textural element that enhances the overall experience by contrasting with the crunch of the pastry.

Also had the salty caramel brownie.  It was quite good.  The caramel had a soft texture"}
{"text":"This place is BUSY all the time. They have nice little seats around the place. Very Hipster friendly and the theme is very artsy fartsy modern.

They've got a large selection of goodies but you have to try the SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIE!"}
{"text":"Delish!  Big variety and their salted caramel brownie is awesome! Deff would come here again"}
{"text":"1 delicious chocolate croissant + 1 great place to sit and be = win, Amelie!"}
{"text":"I have been to Amelie's twice, both times in the middle of the night. Even at all hours of the morning the staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. The decor is absolutely adorable. The mismatched plates do nothing but add to the ambiance.

The deserts are beautiful for sure. They are pretty good, but I didn't quite do my \"Happy Food Dance\" from anything that I tried. I will continue to stop by if I'm in the area and enjoy my selections, but I don't know if I'd make the trip out to the neighborhood just to go there."}
{"text":"Must stop destination for tourists.  I love the French surrealist atmosphere--and interesting people that flow through.  I once sat next to Zuul and Peter Venkman from Ghostbusters while I studied SQL.  As much as people rave about the food, I can't say that it's as impressive as the decor.  It's good, but not gourmet.  I do not recommend swinging by in the morning before work, or any time you're in a rush.  The line moves quickly, but is often 15 people deep."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite of all of them. The open kitchen is a perfect; it's great to watch those miracle workers create those famous sweet treats -- salty caramel brownies, anyone? And yes, they serve wine and beer, which pair perfectly with the aforementioned sweet treats. The coffee is good and so are their craft, custom beverages. I've eaten just about everything on the menu, try it all! It's the perfect workspace. I hear complaints on the wi-fi but I've never experienced it."}
{"text":"If the French had anything to do with this je ne sais quoi, is simple divine!
Oh la la decor e french macarons mercy! Now they also speak Italian, they had amazing Cappuccinos bene!"}
{"text":"Favorite study spot, coffee convo spot, game night spot, and late night dessert spot! Delectable desserts are just the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Well, it's not real French bakery but definitely better than most of other bakery. Coffee there is good and pretty strong."}
{"text":"We went first thing in the morning after a long night in the hospital. The food was great. The coffee was great. The customer service was excellent. I loved this place!!!"}
{"text":"Mocha was very good. BLT on croissant was perfect and not too heavy so able to have dessert. Ohhhh, dessert. Took home loaf of cinnamon bread for French toast at home."}
{"text":"amelie's is wonderful and a consistently positive experience. the baked goods case is straight out of paris and everything i've had is delicious. the salted caramel brownies are utterly fantastic and if you can find the chocolate creme brulee it's out of this world. (mocha is also good).

my favorite sandwiches are the seeded roast beef (the horseradish is pungent and delicious) and the ham and gruyere tartine, the cheese is so soft and melty! the bread is so crunchy! i don't even like eggs but think their ham and cheese quiche is stellar! 

iced coffee is strong and not syrupy sweet.

downside: busy. and the line is kind of weird, but there's no real way around it. there's one or two people who hit you up for pastries as you're waiting but then have to wait until you get to the register to order anything else. don't forget  your table number either! service can leave a bit to be desired, though i'm convinced the food makes up for it.

because they are packed sometimes, consider sitting in the atrium area behind amelie's (doors on both sides)."}
{"text":"Cool concept  trendy but really  desserts and pastries. Are dry no flavor I was expecting fresh flavorful  pastries what I got was frozen out of a box."}
{"text":"My first visit to Amelie's and I am a lifelong, hymn-singing devotee.  I knew I can expect quality goodies from the many reviews I read, but to try them in real time was another experience.  I went in after a late lunch with my sister (we saved our dessert space specifically for Amelies)  Stepping in, the insides were soooooo cute, just makes you want to stay in for a couple hours :)  All the desserts looked simply indulgent, and it was hard to select just 2-3 items.  I love tea cakes, but when I couldnt decide between the raspberry and lemon, the lovely lady said she would choose raspberry--as did I.  And Im glad I did because it was so light yet rich and flavorful.  Light because I didnt feel the need for milk with it :-D  I also got a Palmier (very crispy and buttery) and a cinnamon stick.  I chose smaller and lighter things because I had a big lunch.  I will be back to sample everything else, and more time on my hands.
The service was excellent, even with a line behind me, the person behind the counter patiently waited while I selected.  Everyone was nice, helpful and fast."}
{"text":"We luv the macarons and coffee. So many choices to choose from
A destination to stop by and relax"}
{"text":"Had a GREAT customer service experience at Amelie's today. We weren't happy with a cake purchase we made there and they gladly refunded us. A five star rating for their customer service (the three star reflects not liking the cake)."}
{"text":"Love me some Amelie's!  Great coffee and delicious bites.  The salted caramel browine is a staple here, but don't forget to try the other goodies.  This place is open 24/7 and is packed 22/7.  So be prepared to wait unless you get lucky!"}
{"text":"Some things are so good that it's wise you keep it at arms length.  I'd have to say that Amelie's falls into that foodie category.  Between the pastries, eclectic crowd, creative decor and 24-hour access, I'm pretty sure I'd be a blimp if I lived in N. Davidson!  I'm visiting Charlotte this week and hanging with the TonyaP so I knew this place HAD to be good.  

We popped in last night and there was a line snaking in front of the counter but not to worry, it moves quickly.  I stuck my head into the side room and was amazed at what I saw: antiqued furniture, high ceilings and lush fabrics.  Everything at Amelie's falls under creative, shabby chic!  Loved the overhead light piece shrouded by stainless steel cups, graters and other kitchen items.  My eyes immediately got drawn to the lit pastry case where my visual tummy was dazzled by the array of delectable sweets.  Pecan pie, fruit tarts, napoleons, eclairs and more, me wants it all!  I took it \"easy\" ordering up three items and everything was boxed up for us.  

But if you know Tonya or myself, we are NOT gonna wait.  Plopped ourselves down on some stools and dug in.  That pecan pie was wonderful, full of nuts to counteract the rich, sweet filling.  And a great sweet crust that wasn't over-baked.  One of the best pecan pies I've had since it was more nutty than usual, I tried to hog it all up but shared a bite with my Yelp host.  I was buzzing with the sugar so I wisely held off on the peach tart and sea salt brownie until laters...  Seriously good baked goods, there's a lot of love and talent being placed into their product here.  Update: Finally ate the sea salt caramel brownie and it was UNBELIEVABLE!  

What can I say but Amelie's rocked it out for me!  This bakery would do well in any urban center including San Francisco, call me impressed.  So Charlotte, enjoy Amelie's for everything it's got.  I for one am totally jealous that you've got this amazingly tempting bakery here.  Thankfully I'm 150 miles away, Amelie!  

We'll have to have a long-distance relationship, girl..."}
{"text":"It was love from the first moment I walked in!  I can't get enough of this place.  I like the fact that it is open 24 hours if we are looking for a decent late night hang spot this is the place.  The food, pastries and coffee are all amazing.  The cool decorations are also a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Such a lovely and charming place! Really felt like I were in Paris. :) I loved their decor and their pastries. So yummy! Very filling though. We've got a vanilla eclair, chocolate cake (don't remember the name), and coconut macaron. 
We will definitely be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"I find the staff to be very unprofessional. They gossip audibly and loudly in the presence of customers. The pastries are overpriced but are good. A good atmosphere. So I guess my biggest issue is the unprofessional staff and inflated prices."}
{"text":"I find this place to be over rated and service is always poor. Slow internet."}
{"text":"I really like the new location, it's a great use of the space. However, I would really like it if they would rethink their iced coffee drinks. They only have one size for an iced caramel latte-12 oz, which is smaller than most other places, and it is $4.49. Very expensive when half of the cup is ice!! It would be nice if they would add a 16 oz size cup for that same price, to be competitive with other coffee places."}
{"text":"While I love the concept of Amelies I am very disappointed with their service. Today no sooner did I finish paying for my quiche than another girl announced they were out of it. No more meat quiche...at 8:30 in the morning! I had to get a refund and go somewhere else. This is the second time it has happened to me here. Very poor planning if you can't have enough of a breakfast item made ahead. I doubt I will come here any more."}
{"text":"I came here today for breakfast hoping to get some of their delicious quiche but they were out. Instead I got a sausage egg and cheddar sandwich on a croissant. I was informed it was 75 cents extra for them to scramble the egg, which I thought was pretty ridiculous. The total cost of my sandwich and small coffee was almost 8 dollars which is quite a bit more than what I pay at other places around town. When I got my sandwich it was pretty small and the croissant was so dry that when I bit into it it fell apart into flakes on the plate and was impossible to eat. Very disappointed in this experience overall. I did mention this to one of the workers and he did offer to get me something else so that is appreciated but I think they need to make a few changes with their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ordered using the Favor App because my coworker and I were craving something sweet and couldn't leave the office.

We ordered a Napoleon an Eclair and a Coffee Torte. The coffee torte was not available so I asked the driver to pick up something coffee flavored. 

He brought back the first two items and then a beautiful layered cake of sorts that seemed to have some coffee flavored cream in between the layers of sponge.

I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. The Eclair was ok but didn't taste fresh and the coffee \"cake\" definitely wasn't fresh, it had that \"been in the cold case for a couple of days\" flavor. I didn't try the Napoleon but my coworker said it was good.

The sizes of all the sweets were large enough to share between two people but I still find them to be on the pricey side. Those 3 items alone where almost $16 (no I am not including the delivery fee from Favor). 

Next time, I will have to go in person to see what moves the most and try something that tastes like it was made that day."}
{"text":"My wife loves Amelie's for their French-style treats! We always visit when we're nearby. The blueberry and pecan tarts are my favorites. In a South full of high-sugar-packed desserts, we love the less-sweet French take on confections! All Charlotte locations are equally as solid, too."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot in the NoDa area!

If you don't mind waiting in line, this place is perfect for a pastry or maybe a breakfast sandwich. It was recommend to me by a local & since we were near by, we decided to check it out. They have plenty of pastries, sweets & sandwiches to choose from. I went simple and ordered a Sausage, Egg, Swiss & Egg Croissant. It was extremely fresh filled me right up. Although the line is long, it moves pretty quick and they bring you your food within minutes. 

The decor is unique. Nothing matches, yet looks so well
together. Plenty of seating and space to study, bring a friend or a group and munch out. Deff a favorite of mine in Charlotte and I will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Coffee shops are my favorite places. Give me a good coffee shop, and I'll be a happy camper. I can say, without a doubt, that not only is Amelie's fantastic, but it's my favorite shop I've ever been in.

Their coffee is great, but possibly superseding their beverages (including their teas and French soda), is each and every pastry I've had thus far. I'd heard reviews of their salted caramel brownie for months prior to going, and it lives up to the hype. However for me, their Napoleon is worth the drive there. Though the lines are long, the wait is unbelievably worth it. Best French pastries I've ever had."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of NoDa is Amelie's and it's simply amazing. Great selection of baked goods and other great eats. The decorations add to the experience. Whether you come here to eat or simply for dessert you'll love it!"}
{"text":"A 24/7 French bakery is just a genius concept in general. Have been coming here since the first weekend I've moved in Charlotte 4 years ago and it's been a staple place for me to take out-of-towners ever since. Everyone says it, but they say it for a reason. You have to try the salted caramel brownie. Even if it's just a few bites since it's so rich.. but it's worth every bite. Their lattes are also great and ambiance in this place is fun, eclectic and stands out to the other local bakeries in town. Perfect spot for meeting friends/or catching up on work-- you'll see both here.  

**Rumor has it--they're opening a new 11,000 sq. foot location in Uptown replacing the College Plaza cafeteria at Wells Fargo Two. Uptown needs more local coffee shops (especially ones open on weekends).. so very excited about this!"}
{"text":"First time here and was really disappointed. Paid $50 for stale macaroons, flavorless soup, and a sandwich that was totally unappealing."}
{"text":"Busy little bakery, eh? The pastries looked divine, the bread smelled fantastic, and the coffee did its job. The atmosphere was whimsical, funky, and colorful!

The downside was the fresh sourdough bread that they baked for me while I was having breakfast there. I envisioned a flaky and firm crust with a fluffy, hot inside. Wrong vision. It was hard through and through. Bummer, big time."}
{"text":"This place is great for satisfying that sweet craving you have! There are numerous items on the list and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I am a HUGE sweets addict and I'm always very pleased when I come. Of course there is always coffee on the menu for all of you coffee lovers!"}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. Sometimes I gaze at the bakery counter and just dream about trying every one of them..... One day I will. 

I really enjoy their breakfast sandwiches--the croissants are perfectly flaky and buttery. 

I also love the French macarons and the caramel salted brownie."}
{"text":"This place is awesome; cool decor, great service, and the food was very good.  Have been in town a few days and highly recommend anyone traveling in. Cappuccino was on point! For breakfast I had the croissant with ham egg and Asiago, delish."}
{"text":"I might just move into Amelie's -- and I could probably totally get away with it since I hear they are a 24-hour biz. And if they didn't mind me camping in a corner with my laptop and washing my hair in their bathroom sink and receiving mail there, this relocation could be viable on both sides.

I mean, I love coffee. And I love homemade dessert. So they would have quite the perma-customer. All in exchange for allowing a drifter to indulge in their cute and quirky space: striped walls, hip chandeliers, arty black & white photography.

In other words, lurved it. Enjoyed my ice latte too. But unfortunately, the coffee torte left a little something to be desired -- evidenced by the fact that I left mine only 2/3 finished. UNHEARD of when it comes to dessert. However, I'm not holding it too much against them since they have a display case FULL of tempting goodies... many of which I'm sure will become staple meals of mine once I move in."}
{"text":"Anything you put in your mouth here will be delicious.  I've been coming here since it first opened 5 years ago and it is always perfection.  The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is that it is now so overrun with people that the ambiance that Amelie's once had no longer exists.  Get the petit gateaux vanilla strawberry mini cake thing!"}
{"text":"Eclectic and quirky setting with delectable desserts.  Plan to take my daughter with her teen friends for her birthday."}
{"text":"The food and coffee are always delish. Some favorites .... Cafe Marcotter, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Any of the Soups, and all of the Pastries. The negative aspect is the counter service and checkout. This is a wildly popular place, and when the line snakes around into other rooms, it makes sense to have more than one or two people working the line. We've been there multiple times where this is the case, and it is very frustrating. But we keep going back, so that should speak to the quality of the food. :)"}
{"text":"Loved this french-style cafe in Charlotte. The decor was just perfect - the cafe had a huge space and the furniture was tastefully selected. The bacon, fig and brie tartine was phenomenal and their signature Cafe Glace was just what I needed on a hot summer day. I had a sip of my friend's Creme Brulee soda and it tasted like an ice cream float with melted ice cream, which was delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"As a newcomer to Charlotte, I was here for a day before I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth.  The ambience is hip & would be a cool place to work for a couple of hours.  I had the salted brownie, eclair, the chocolate mousse cup, & the chocolate crossiants.  I love caramel salted anything so was expecting to be blown away based on the previous reviewers.  I was not awed. Chocolate mousse cup - wow!!!..It definitely needs to be shared - rich does not begin to describe this delectable, luxurious chocolate bliss."}
{"text":"The decor is adorable, and the atmosphere is cozy and definitely encourages hanging out and chatting. Unfortunately, nothing I've had on the menu has been all that great. It all tastes like stuff I could make at my own house (some of which I could make much better). I really wanted to love it though, what with all my friends' raving."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Amelie's mainly for the atmosphere.  It's a great spot that's open 24 and has lots of quirky decor that the owner has refurbished.  The salted carmel brownie is SO good! Hands-down my favorite dessert item here.  The french loaf is also really great and I love that it comes with various butters/jellies.  I am not a huge fan of the cakes, as they are a bit dry for me. It is definitely a must visit in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! The salted caramel brownie and peanut butter chocolate petit-four are so bomb"}
{"text":"There's food here I haven't seen since I went to France!  Awesome.  Legit."}
{"text":"Go for the french press coffee, the macarons, the croissants, the tea, the lemonade, the hot chocolate, the salted caramel brownie, the espresso, the cakes, the tartines, the quiche, the people watching, the decor, the hours, the location, the ambiance.  

Seriously, why are you still reading this?  Just go to Amelie's!"}
{"text":"I like Amelie's.....good coffee and drinks- BUT the pastries (and anything else) are a tad on the pricey side. I can't say I've ever been to a (sit down) bakery where the items were so much- maybe you're paying for the 24 hour part?"}
{"text":"I can't wait for Amelie's to open uptown.  The NoDa location is comfortable and eclectic.  The pastries are divine and the staff knowledgeable and friendly.  Had the macaroons this week with a cup of tea and just have just kept eating them."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and beautiful collection of decor! Its a must experience for Charlotte! Try to go before the late night crowd because the line can be insane since they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Having visited the NoDa location several times I was quite excited to try their newest location. All of the food and pastries are the same, and the quality is very good.  This review is more about the customer service experience I had on the SECOND DAY OF this location was open, and the cleanliness of the establishment. Both were very, very, very, poor. It's cool that you can bring a lock to profess your love and put it on a fence, but the romance is kinda lost when you have to step over and around garbage and uneaten food that has spilled out of the overflowing trash can on the outside patio. It's real hip to have a coffee bar, but the cool factor is lost when the barista has no idea what Splenda is or even looks like. Makes me wonder if they know what espresso is, or is it all just coffee to them?   

We began our visit later in the day and waited 30 minutes in line to order.   The young woman that \"helped\" us at the counter did not greet us and plated our selection in silence. The cashier was even worse, though she had to talk to us in order to let me know how much I owed. She didn't thank us or offer any good by. A blank look told me my transaction had ended and that she was finished with me. If this was my business, she would have been terminated instantly. Seriously. It was that bad. 

The air conditioning was either broken that day  or they wanted us to experience what it is like to work in the bakery near the oven. The heat inside, combined with the fumes from fresh paint drove us outside to the trash strewn patio. It's lovely and the chairs are very comfortable. Sadly the dirty tables, and overflowing trash bin kinda spoiled it. One poor guy was sitting at a table near this trash bin and got a leg full of what looked like milk, frosting (could also have been whip cream) and some other brownish liquid when another patron foolishly tried to throw something away, and a big pile of trash spilled out of the bin. Thankfully there were no Yellow Jackets, but if they continue to let the trash overflow, they will attract them for sure. My family and I finished our pastries and decided to throw our trash away inside.  The first and only trash bin we encountered was full to the top. Not wanting to add to this debacle, we left our trash on a table and left. 

It's going to be awhile before I return. They must get their sanitation routine down better and they need to weed through a few lousy cashiers and counter help before they are up to acceptable standards."}
{"text":"In spite of being as meaningless as Spinal Tap's amp volume knobs going up to 11, and knowing that it would only reassign the meaning the 5th star now holds, I still sometimes wish I could award a business 6 stars. This is one of those times. 

So good is Amelie's, that the idea of existence without their flaky pastry crust, fresh fruit toppings, expertly prepared cafe au lait and mind altering soups and sandwiches begins to lose all illusion of objective meaning. It becomes the raison d'être.* Life outside Amelie's warm, maternal embrace is quickly overwhelmed with a nagging sense of ennui. Why continue to carry on, if not for more of this ambrosial confectionery? Had Albert Camus been familiar with Amelie's I'm convinced he would not have suggested stoic revolt against the absurdity of existence as the only alternative to suicide. It's not so hard to imagine Sisyphus happy, as Camus suggested we must, if he gets a lovely little pastry each time he rolls his stone to the top of the hill.

This conviction was reaffirmed in me again this weekend with probably the best pastry I've ever had. It was a raspberry cream cheese danish and it was like some sweet, illicit drug. If you've ever seen Requiem for a Dream and remember the quick montage of shots of dilating pupils and blood rushing through capillaries the moment the characters shoot up, you'll get a sense of what the first bite was like. I thought I saw God.

All exaggeration aside, the raspberry cream cheese danish really was the best I've ever had. If they happen to be out of raspberry, get the blackberry. It's not quite as good but that's just my personal preference for raspberries. Both have whole, fresh berries on top and are as pretty as they are delicious. 

 
*Please forgive all the overbearing and pretentious French phrases. It seemed apropos for an Amelie's review to revert to French in search of le mot juste."}
{"text":"Great selection of pastries and cakes. Just as delicious as the NoDa location. The coffee is superb as well. Service is friendly and the lines aren't too bad based on what time you stop by. The space is fairly large so odds are you can snag a table and get some work done on non-peak hours."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious - haven't had a bad dish yet.  Tartine was crispy and perfect portion.  Coffee is good.  Deserts - yum
Negative - always busy and loud, pricy"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and I wish there were more like it in Charlotte. Everything I've had here is delicious and you should be able to find something to suit any craving. The only downside is it's always packed because people camp out here all day with their laptops. The decor is whimsical and fun, and it makes for a fun after dinner or middle-of-the-night outing."}
{"text":"Place is relaxed, organized with friendly staff. Perfect for doing some light studying for a quick coffee with a date. Not many vegetarian options so please be prepared."}
{"text":"Perfect French desserts with a cute atmosphere and great places to sit. Eclectic with great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"They have a gluten free salted brownie which is delicious. I had the portobello mushroom salad which was good and a nice sized portion. I love their teas."}
{"text":"awesome breakfasts.... pastires to die for   Salted Caramel is world renown and deserves it!  excellent coffee... and people watching like no other place ever been."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Amelie's that you don't already know?  It's the perfect place for a carafe of french press, a few pastries and some good ol' fashion people watching.  Not to mention it's open 24 hours!

Bring your computer or a book and spend some time in this magical cafe.    

One of my favorite spots, hands down."}
{"text":"Want to give Amelie's another try. Again I don't recommend the food. It's lazily put together and not much quality control as with other locations. Croissant was burnt/overcooked and crumbled. No condiments on the blt. The soup was mediocre and I ate it since I was starving. The ice tea cups are tiny and no real good way to get refills, especially when the line is long. Desserts are okay, nothing special.  The interior is smaller than other spaces they have, but it's clean and comfortable seating. I also like the coffee bar type seating they have on the upper level so if you come alone you don't feel like you are taking up the whole table. There also not a spectate ordering line for food/coffee and dessert so the line readily backed up during lunch. I really want to like Amelie's again, but quality just plummeted since 2013. Adios Amelie's."}
{"text":"Well, it obviously a very famous place for their great pastries, sandwiches, soups, beverages. This place is very special for me and my wife and have had great memories here. It being 24x7 operational, adds more value to itself. My fav are the most familiar Salted Caramel Brownie, chocolate gateaux, chicken salad sandwich, almond cake (to die for), and Chai tea latte. This is the first place where we tried Chai tea latte with soy milk and that taste has become a standard.  The ambience for sure gives you a French feel or at least you will learn the French taste. Friday and Saturday late nights are always pretty crowded as lot of people come here for their favorite bites after party. With wifi it's a great place to work/study as well. A must go in Charlotte if you like pastries :)"}
{"text":"Came here on my weekend trip to Charlotte. Cannot believe this place is open 24/7. Hipster vibe; feels like you are in someone's living room. Great selection of pastries. Ordered the Napoleon as I don't see if often in shops as well as a baguette sandwich. Great time to spend the afternoon with a friend or solo!"}
{"text":"I've never been to France but I'm guessing this is as close as it gets in NoDA-Charlotte, NC. I highly recommend the tea cakes and the twice baked croissants. They go great with hot tea or coffee. A little pricey but worth the deliciousness."}
{"text":"A very unique place, the best part is that they are open all the time.  They have some very interesting chandeliers and paintings.  Good variety of pastries as well as their cheese flavors that they have.  The coffee is kickass here, over all a very good place to hang out.  It has mixed crowds and perfect location in NODA.  I do plan to visit it more often on my trips to Charlotte."}
{"text":"24 hour bakery?  Um..yes, please!  Expensive, but if you select carefully then you win.

BUY:
- Napoleon
- Salted caramel brownie
- Palmier (aka: elephant ears)
- rosemary lemon iced tea

CONSIDER:
- tarts
- little fudge like squares (some are better than others)

PASS:
- chocolate croissants (dry & kinda stale)
- macarons 

As you can see, I did a lot of market research for you guys.  Not 'cuz I'm a total fatty, but for Yelp.  Yeahhh.............."}
{"text":"My 10 year old daughter gives Amelie 5 stars. She had the Blueberry Muffin and said it was fabulous. I had the quiche and an Americano. The coffee was great and the food is good. We will be back for some macaroons before the weekend is over."}
{"text":"Has been a great place to get my French fix! 

Love their Pâté de Campagne avec cornichons on a fresh baguette! Yummy!!!

Soups are great! and of course their patisseries!!!"}
{"text":"The hipster in me would like to inform you that this place isn't what it used to be, but the realist is still super happy to have a unique 24 hour bakery hangout in Charlotte. 
Yes the pastries are a little less artisanal now, but give them credit for the ability to scale up and produce a crap ton of desserts and food at all hours! It's still legions better than alot of commercial baked goods.  There is plenty to choose from even at 1 am, prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great. 
For best quality I would stick with the originals, including the salted caramel brownie, napoleon and mini gateaus. I wasn't too impressed with the macarons or smore pastry, the espresso was very decent but too sour for my taste."}
{"text":"It wasn't until I had something I disliked at Amelie's that I was prompted to write a review. There are probably millions of Amelie's raving fans out there. I have been gorging to this 24/7 gem since 2009 and I love giving new friends their first \"Amelie's experience.\"

I went a few days and witnessed- the first \"sale\" item I had ever seen there- BOGO raspberry cream puffs. Of course I had to try this. I have tried most the menu here and this was the first time I was ever disappointed. Amelie's is quality and fresh ingredients-  consistently.

You must try the salted caramel brownie - that goes without saying. Their soup is divine as are their sandwiches both breakfast and their more lunch/dinner options. This place oddly enough is the calmest during the day and morning. Around 7pm this is when the line goes out the door to past 2am. Three years of eating here and I just witnessed their first misstep. If I ever move from Charlotte I will dream every night about Amelie's and it would be my first stop on every trip back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Macarons and salted caramel brownies are amazing. You also have to try their lavender raspberry lemonade. Their coffee is really good too I got an iced mocha with almond milk in it was delicious. I have never had anything that wasn't good here. The Park Road location is really awesome"}
{"text":"Good concept poorly executed. Frozen pastries, minimum wage workers all in AA programs working ungodly hours, and every weirdo crossdressing you can imagine round out this odd establishment. Those are just the high points. If you're not a cool kid, they'll ignore you and even kick you out. Please use your imagination and find a true bakery."}
{"text":"Great desserts. Lovely restaurant.  Love the selection.  The napoleons as well the tortes, brownies, especially the caramel brownie, cakes are all so good."}
{"text":"We have recently discovered the Rock Hill location in the former Citizen Corners building.  Such an amazing place for many reasons! Our kids are enthralled with the upstairs loft that allows you to overlook the entire shop.  The quirky decor and interesting art is a feast for the eyes.  And the pastry!!! Croissants to die for! Dainty little petit fours, tarts, and eclairs are just incredible. And a damn fine cup of coffee.  We love this place for date night or a family treat."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for quite some time, and i say this place is the spot to meet up with your friend.

Let me first start off by saying there aren't many places around Charlotte where you can just meet up with your friends and chill.  This places gives you that viable option.  The convenience of a 24 hours bakery is a great idea where you can meet up if you still wanna chill after the bars and clubs.  

This place is pretty fancy with discrete furniture decor and artsy decorations.  Now if were talking about the environment and ambiance of this place, i would give it a thumbs up. If were talking about the quality of food, i would say it is okay.

I've had many of the desserts here from the fruit tarts to the macaroons.  To summarize the food choices here i would say its not the freshest.  I hate to bash this place but the food is just alright.  Im more use to a softer crust macroons but these are just a bit on the hard side.

Would i still come here agian? Absolutely."}
{"text":"ITS WORTH THE WAIT!!!!! If you go here on the weekend or at night and see a line do not be scared get in line!!!! It goes by pretty fast and it's sooooo worth it! Food and baked goods are both fantastic! And yes, it really is open all the time"}
{"text":"They have an extensive bakery selection with all items prepared on site. There is usually long lines and the kitchen can be a bit slow getting your order out. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Amazing desserts. Excellent staff. Haven't had food yet,  but looking forward to that experience. 
I had the salted caramel brownie. Smooth caramel on a crispy gooey brownie. Sooooooo good!
We had the chocolate eclair, cream puff and chocolate cake. All, breathtakingly delicious."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute must when visiting NC! The decor is so amazing and so unique. Staff members are kind and welcoming. The macarons were perfect and so tasty. $2+ for a macaron was a bit much but I will say that it was worth it. The Noda location is pretty big but it was busy during the Saturday lunch hour, leaving very little sitting areas. Amélie's is the perfect place for a cute bridal shower, perfect place for studying, & perfect for a little dessert any time of the day!"}
{"text":"Bonjour!!

In my book, the ultimate Charlotte weekend would be to take a long walk through the Sugar Creek Greenway, watch a Panthers Home Game, stroll through one of the many art museums, and enjoy a divine snack at Amélie's. Fortunately with the growing number of locations, the latter is becoming more and more convenient!

Most of you will know of the Park Road Shopping Center but may be surprised to find that the backlot behind the main strip is really starting to develop. Right across from Rocksalt is Amélie's newest location. I think the concept I like most about the design for any of their bakeries is that you walk in and their thoughtful decor gives the illusion that they've been there forever. Tables made from reclaimed wood complement the ornate chandeliers throughout. All of the artwork fits the old-world French Bakery theme that really immerses you into a transfixion where time seems to slow down, you can really enjoy whatever you're nibbling on.

So speaking on nibbling, as a near decade-long patron of the 'original' Amélie's in NoDa, 
I hadn't ordered the Napoleon until a couple of days ago. It is the ultimate pastry showstopper that they serve in the most traditional fashion of alternating layers of puff pastry and creme, topped with an elegant icing pattern. It's baffling to be such a work of art, yet able to be ordered any time you want. Such an incredibly technical pastry at the drop of a hat is reason enough to stop by. Bravo Amélie's, you've dazzled me dozens of times in the past but this one 'takes the cake!'

If you're looking for more savory refreshments then you're in luck. I think the prominent case of sweets makes the sandwich menu take a bit of a back seat, but you should definitely give it a go. Most of their sandwiches are served on either a croissant or a baguette, but they will gladly swap one out for the other. I'm always debating between the Roast Beef & Manchego  Croissant or the Chicken Salad Croissant. You won't be disappointed by either but don't take my word for it! Be sure to check the menu for seasonal additions and especially the rotating soups that are always just marvelous; perfectly seasoned and wholesome, what more could you ask for?

One day I'm hoping for one of those 'work from home' jobs where I can work on my laptop, sip on Russian Tea, and munch on morsel after morsel at the coffee bar here. Until then, the visits to Amélie's are the feature of my mornings.

Au revoir!"}
{"text":"Had a croque Monsieur and a salted caramel torte.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted the croissant warm and flaky and the ham and cheese plentiful and tasty...so good."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. A French bakery in a great location with a funky, comfortable atmosphere that's open 24 hours a day? How can you go wrong? It's always busy here. I've been only a few times when there wasn't a line for pastries. Expect a very long line in the late/evenings early mornings on the weekends. Everything I've had here is amazing. My favorites are the twice baked chocolate croissant and the salted caramel brownie. Their baristas are amazing too (one of their former baristas, a short young  guy with dark hair was extremely rude but he's gone now, thank goodness) so I enjoy a latte while I'm there as well. Love supporting local businesses so we will be coming here for as long as they are in the area."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit this famous Charlotte patisserie not only because everyone was raving about the their delicious tarts, croissants, & eclairs, but also because it's open ALL THE TIME (24hrs/day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year) and they are welcoming of all kinds of people to hangout, read, study.

First off, the good: 
- Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie.  You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies!
- Their creme brûlée was delicious, and the fact that they flambé/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch. 
- Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again.
 
The only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items: 
- The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this!  I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old/dry these were.
- The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly \"aged\" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me.

Overall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons.  As for the disappointing croissant,  I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner, and ended up having dessert only, so that I can try several of their creations. While the chocolate croissant and eclair were on par with any other decent French bakery that I have been to, the salted caramel brownie was absolutely sublime. Granted, it's only for those that have a sweet tooth, but the taste, texture, look, and smell, were all top notch. The interior is eccentric and fun with ample seating, there's chilled water available with cups, and the staff were great. Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte for French Pastries, Sandwiches, and Soup. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very popular spot in Charlotte, great desserts but the soups are to die for. I love going there grabbing myself some soup late at night to early morning and watching all the students studying. I'm not a student myself was past that age but to watch a person enjoy desserts and work their ass off a better future. There is good satisfaction in that environment when I'm there. I'm weird like that. Get the soups! Bomb.com"}
{"text":"Much need for thoughs sweet craving after dark. No other place in south Charlotte to go so even though it's ain't the same as the one in uptown it any bad."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Eat. All. The. Desserts. I go here every time I visit and I'm never disappointed. Don't let the long lines intimidate you: it's worth the wait!!

There's a sea salt caramel bar that is to DIE for. Also their macarons are amazing! I love everything I eat here so I'm biased. Ha!"}
{"text":"Amelie's in NoDa is \"The O.G.\" or as I like to put it, 'My 3rd Shift Savior' (back in the day, when I rolled at night). Where else are you going to go to get a chocolate croissant at 2:30 in the morning? Wait, why do you want a croissant at that hour? None of my business, it's yours if you're in NoDa!

Located at the corner of 28th and N. Davidson, Amelie's is everything you've ever wanted in a corner side cafe. They make premium coffee, tea, and desserts as well as many lunch offerings. My hands down favorite for lunch is the Chicken Salad croissant: chunky texture, very little filler (just for binding), buttery flaky pastry, excuse me for a moment I need to take a drive back there now!

How about sweets? Mixed berry Macaron is a crowd-pleaser. Be sure to ask the counter staff about all of the macarons on display. The Salted Caramel Layered Torte is great, as long as I didn't have something too filling to eat before because this thing is as rich as it comes. If you're familiar with the Salted Caramel Brownie, add laters of mousse in between with more chocolate. WOW

Mad respect where it is due, with this being the original location, but I'm a much more frequent patron of the uptown location. Not due to proximity, because I'm much, much closer to the NoDa site, but because of the typical crowdedness of the place. Forget about sitting anywhere near the service counter unless you want to be brushed up against by dozens of people you don't know! Even the back is iffy sometimes if they're really busy as the line can easily back up 50-60 deep. They're doing the best they can, trust me, it's just a really busy spot. Don't even think about going here after a N. Charlotte event or a NBA game, you're doomed. When it comes to crowd control, they're a victim of their tremendous success.

Yes, logic would have you believe that the Uptown location would be busier, but it's almost always the exact opposite. Still, sometimes I'll pick a time I know it won't be too bad (think very, very early on a weekday, like 5am) just to enjoy the ambiance this location offers, knowing that I'm sitting in the middle of Charlotte history, and wondering where they'll pop up next (please be University, Mallard Creek even better!).

To all the people who thought a 24/7 bakery in the middle of NoDa would close down within 3 months, look at them now. Break bread with your neighbors and join in the pride of watching this great QC brand continue to grow and wow you with enticing treats!"}
{"text":"A quick look at my profile will reveal that I'm a true Amélie's loyalist. What makes this location special for me is its two miles away from my office! Drink, ALL THE COFFEE!

You'll find the usual Amélie's offerings in a less compact seating arrangement compared to NoDa. Speaking of which, if you're nearby, this location is a great place to try the pastries because it's not nearly as busy as the NoDa spot (yet!).

They always have some sort of seasonal offering and today I tried the fall-themed S'mores Macaron. Scrumptious, vanilla, wafer-like cookie texture, with a creamy marshmallow & dark chocolate filling, yum! The Pecan tart is also great and it might give your grandma's coveted pie recipe a run for its money!

If you don't have a sweet tooth and are coming in for coffee, tea, or something from the lunch menu, feel free to bypass the crowd in the pastry line and go straight to the register. The Uptown location has solved this potentially unnecessary waiting with line dividers which makes it very clear that you don't have to wait in the line if you're not getting delicious pastries, perhaps they don't have that problem here.

Now, my only concern is my waistline. Curse you Amélie's, with your delectable treats around every corner of my day to day life. I fear I must admit defeat resisting you, but hey at least I get a delicious coffee as a consolation prize!"}
{"text":"As a lifelong member of the NoDa crowd, I get a big sense of pride watching a local small business grow into a stately community centerpiece. A FANTASTIC option for impressing visitors to Charlotte. Amélie's is great for a quick or small dessert after dinner and within walking distance from some of the best restaurants in Uptown.

The Amélie's brand has had a ton of success in the most recent decade, opening locations in the Caramel Commons and Park Rd neighborhoods. The key is the consistency in their premium treats. You can go to any Amélie's in the area and ask for the Salted Caramel Brownie and know you're about to have one of the best little morsels in the city no matter which location you're at. This location in particular has a LOT of spacious seating, especially for an uptown location. On the right side of the restaurant you can sit and watch pastries being made behind the huge glass window revealing the entire kitchen, and at the same time people-watch the hustle and bustle of College Street.

The decor is as unique as it gets. They got a thing for unusual chandeliers (ex. they made one out of stainless steel kitchen utensils). The interior design really is a must-see. Facilities are always clean from the tables to the floors, and the staff is friendly and very patient (which is a godsend, even as a seasoned Amélie's patron, I'll sometimes zone out just looking at all the delicious options in the display case).

My recommendation? Give the Dark Chocolate Raspberry Tart a try. You get a nice sized pastry with a rich chocolate ganache piping outlining the sweet fruit filling, on a firm yet flaky pastry pie tart. Also ask the counter staff what their seasonal treats are at the time. They typically have 1 or 2 seasonal Macarons in the case, all which have a perfect crispy wafer texture and incredible fillings.

Found this page and they're closed? No worries, their NoDa location (the original) is open 24/7 and just 10 min outside Uptown; just go 3 blocks to S Davidson, and 2.5mi north, you'll see the store right after Free Range Brewing.

Whatever your sweet tooth craves, you'll surely find something here! I really tried to think of something to critique, but couldn't think of anything valid enough to note... maybe offer free all-day parking? Yeah, get on that, then it'll be perfect!"}
{"text":"I loved the breakfast sandwiches and salted caramel brownie. We went to the Pineville location and there was ample seating and no wait."}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere. Friendly staff. Delicious treats. Tasty drinks. I am quite surprised it does not have 5 stars. Every time my boyfriend and I traveled to Charlotte, our first stop was Amelie's. A box of macaroons, a chocolate croissant, an apple turnover, and coffee. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought this place was decent not spectacular. The bakery look pretty but they were overly sweet. The spacing is great and spacious"}
{"text":"Amelie's Bakery has grown into a staple of Charlotte and specifically the Noda neighborhood. From the cool decor and expansive layout of the restaurant to the vast selection of pastries, desserts, breakfast sandwiches and coffee drinks, it's the place to go whether you're hanging out with friends or looking for a trendy study spot (if you like a little distraction and noise while you study). This morning I just had coffee, but my mom created her own breakfast croissant with sausage, egg, tomato and cheddar cheese and absolutely loved it. Typically, I just visit for the delicious desserts but I definitely need to go more in the morning to check out their breakfast options, whether that's a sandwich, quiche or a pastry! My top desserts from Amelie's are: mini mousse cups, chocolate eclairs and the chocolate/raspberry and the mixed berry tarts. I wasn't too impressed with the Chocolate Petit Gâteaux, however the presentation was impeccable! Overall, Amelie's is a must if you're visiting Charlotte and a great place to relax and people watch."}
{"text":"Yes, the salted carmel brownies are tasty.  So are the eclairs and the all the petit something or others and macaroons.  Its a french bakery, that stuff is supposed to be good.

Let's be honest, the place is popular because they are open 24 hours a day.  

The underage hipsters see it as a great place to all hang out and sit in the cushy little seating areas amongst the odd paint by numbers art and the victorian mish mash and talk about their twitter accounts, tight jeans, and shaggy haircuts without their parents thinking they are getting in trouble.

For the rest of us, its that awesome place to get that last edible nightcap after all the bars have stopped serving food or closed.  I yearn for a sausage egg and cheese croissant after a night of staying on the edge of the mosh pit at the Milestone.

Yes, I have been there during the light of day.  The wifi is a little slow, but it is a nice quiet joint if you need to plow through some work."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my family on a Sunday around 2 pm and it was packed. We had to wait in line at least 25-30 minutes to order. There is a lot of seating but with the number of people who come here you will be hard to get one! The desserts however are delicious. We sampled the vanilla filled eclaire and it was wonderful. We also sampled a mini chocolate tart and a white chocolate pistachio bite. They were both amazing, especially the pistachio. 
I can't wait to go back here and try some other desserts as well as some of their coffee."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars. If you would have asked me a few years back, it would have been hands down 5 stars. The desserts here are to die for. 

Before I lived in Charlotte, my beau would take me here on my visits to the city. The baby blue, lost-in-wonderland theme was charming and I wanted one of everything on the menu. While it's a bit pricey, they also serve french press coffee that is every bit worth the price.

That said, the experience has lost it's luster in my past few visits. Amelie's was becoming well known and deservingly so. Every pastry I've had from them was absolutely divine. Who wouldn't want to come here?

Perhaps I've just come at cosmic peak hours, but the lines had grown to Disneyland proportions in my recent visits. The cashiers started to come down the line to take our orders before we were anywhere near the glass cases to look at our options. How am I supposed to know what I want when I haven't even seen it yet? In both my last visits, they also informed us in the line that it would be 30-45 minutes if we wanted to order a sandwich or anything not pastry. While understandable with the crowd to staff ratio, this was kind of disappointing. 

The inside decor of this place is lovely. Lots of artsy kitchy stuff and cozy couches. However as busy as it was, there was nary a seat in the place. My last couple visits involved devouring a pastry in the enclosed strip mall alley behind the building. Because I've lost hope of enjoying the experience of this place, I no longer go to Amelies. Which is a shame because they have some damned good pastries on their menu."}
{"text":"What a beautiful gem right outside of downtown Charlotte. Located in a little business park, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk through the front doors, you're welcomed by the smell of fresh baked French pastries and surrounded by quaint French decor. It's always busy, but that just speaks of the quality of everything Amélie's produces. I love their French macarons and mini tarts. I got an assortment of the macarons and a mini dark chocolate raspberry tart. All of it was utterly delightful! My mom had a strawberry, vanilla mousse cake (I can't remember the actual name of it) and it was melt-in-your-mouth perfection!

The staff has always been friendly and the line can get a little lengthy, but come and relax. Enjoy the ambiance, French pastries and a cup of tea or coffee."}
{"text":"Oh my god this is one of the best bakeries I've ever been to. I lived in Charlotte for a whole 6 months and this was a frequent stop. It's in a little industrial plaza so if you are not looking you will definitely miss it. When I walked in, I was surprised at how big the place was. The ambiance is truly one of a kind, think of old french quarters. The employees are great. My first time here one of the staff members was with me for about 10 minutes giving recommendations. 
The rumors are true: you MUST get the salted brownie. I also got a chocolate croissant too..... One word: amazing! If you are ever planning a trip to Charlotte or in the mood for something new, you MUST come to Amelie's. You definitely will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Neat concept and decor. Phenomenal treats! One of my favorite stops for dessert when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Good for late night hangouts with friends.. Deserts are delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a very busy weekend. They handled the crowd pretty well. Our breakfast croissant's were fantastic. Light and buttery. Try the apple cider, not the norm, very tasty!!! Definitely worth stopping in. The pastry case will make your head spin!!!"}
{"text":"This's a tricky place!! I'm chocoholic so.. everything with enough chocolate will be good for me lol but if to be serious this place is awesome! We got so many stuff and we took home.. great place5/5 good service 4/5 awesome chocolate 6/5 !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast!  The croissants are crunchy air.  Any pastry you get is outstanding."}
{"text":"Used to be a wonderful place. Went there recently and it has gone downhill. Grungy environment, dirty tables and floors, staff was rude (when we got to checkout we decided to add one more pastry and the employee gave attitude). All of this would be excusable if the food was great. My breakfast sandwich was dry and had no flavor. The macaron was chewy and dry.

Very disappointing! I will be trying the new petit macaron shop next time."}
{"text":"Aside from city parking, this is my favorite Amelie's location! They had more seating and floor space.  We arrived on the tail end of lunch time and the line wasn't bad. It's hard to decide which dessert when there are 3 cases to choose from and you can't see the selection until you are up there and they are waiting for your order! Pressure!

I had the salad with walnuts and I think feta, very good. Palmier, pear tart were yum! My husband had a BLT on a croissant and he liked it as well as his tomato soup. This will be our go to place when we come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amalie's is my go-to breakfast or lunch spot on the weekends. The food, pastries and coffee always taste great. The dog-friendly patio is awesome and the baristas are always sweet enough to make my dog a puppacino (whip cream on a lid). The food always tastes great and I love that I can make half orders of sandwiches or tartines because the regular portions are very large."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and soups.  Worth stopping by both locations, Uptown and NoDa."}
{"text":"Amelie's is the best bakery ever! Their breakfast sandwhiches on homemade french bread or croissant are outstanding! So are all of the huge variety of dessert choices. I would suggest any of the fruit tarts, the pecan tart, the salted caramel brownie, or any of their macaroons. The desserts at Amelie's were also featured on the train scene from The Hunger Games Movie. Just another reason to go to Amelie's."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo cute! I'm totally glad we stopped in. Thank you rain!! The strawberry passion fruit mimosa is to die for"}
{"text":"It is an amazing place to visit with a group or by yourself. Amelie's has a unique atmosphere with a fun, fast moving crowd waiting to devour all of the delicious goodies presented in the glass cases. Don't get overwhelmed. Embrace the energy of all of the smiling people and the friendly staff. They are open 24hrs a day  with free wifi. 

Favorite items are:
Crème brûlée
Salted caramel brownie 
Palmiers 
Anything with fruit on it
All of the soups & sandwiches are amazing

The employees are amazing, the location is amazing, and the amount of seating is usually wonderful. Even if you can't find seating in the main building, there is extra seating outside as well as in the atrium in the back. I have been at many different times of the day and always can find a seat. Even if the tables get a bit crowded most people use the \"sharing is caring\" policy & if you have available seat you can invite others to sit with you. It's a fun way to meet new people :)"}
{"text":"Ok I know everyone will hate me, only 3 stars. The pastries all look better then that actually taste. I feel the place is ok but a real good competitor would give them a real run for the money.
The pricing is over the top. The people that work there are very pleasant. 
A place to go but not as wonderful as I would expect."}
{"text":"Good selection of pastries and the decor is always worth roaming around to discover a unique piece to snap. However the prices are way too high."}
{"text":"Always a great place to pop in and do some work away from the office or home. I especially like the Carmel Commons location b/c it massive and you can spread out.

This location has all the same favorites and variety of the NODA and uptown spots. It's the best coffee we have on the south side and what goes. Eat with coffee...any of the pastries and big breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fantastic find in charlotte!   We found this place as we were driving through and felt like we had a detour in Paris on our way to Hilton Head.  The sandwiches, coffee, and dessert were all amazing.  Of course the atmosphere makes it so welcoming to sit down.  Don't let this seeming out of way location deter you from coming."}
{"text":"Love love love it here!!! Pastries are made in house and fresh!!! Just as great as the other locations!! Long live Amelie's!!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is an adorable little bakery located in the Noda area of Charlotte. If I lived in Charlotte this would be a regular spot for me.

My husband and I ended up at this place looking for a bite to eat when we were in this area of Charlotte visiting breweries. I am really glad we did!

Besides the fun and girlie decor, the first thing that caught my eye here when we entered was the long pastry case. I am a huge fan of desserts and I almost wanted to skip lunch and go straight to the desserts.

However, I ended up ordering the turkey and white cheddar croissant and my husband settled on the roast beef and mozzarella sandwich. There were lots of sandwich choices that appealed to me on the menu. 

The turn-around time from when we placed our order to when our food came out was pretty quick. My sandwich was good and my husband liked his as well. I will say a small pet peeve of mine is when places serve sandwiches without sides and this was one of those places. I did enjoy my sandwich but if I had been hungrier I'm not sure it would have been filling enough.

However, for that, there is always the French pastries for dessert. On this particular visit, I resisted the desserts knowing I would be drinking beer soon, but next time I will be sure to pick up a salted caramel brownie or a few of the macaroons.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Truly, what is not to love about a french bakery?  The salted caramel brownie and vanilla eclairs are my go-to treats, but I also really enjoy their tarts.  They make a killer chai latte with almond milk - the almond milk provides a nice depth to the latte that I haven't found anywhere else in Charlotte.

Open 24 hours/day - be prepared to wait in line, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The weekend I moved to Charlotte, my buddy and I decided to get some brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and deliciousness of what is on offer here.  It was early but there was already a line forming which is a testament to how popular the place is. We ordered a few sandwiches, some coffee and some pastries and all of them were fantastic and the decor positively compliments the food. 

Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was out of hope looking for a nice bakery in Charlotte to get my pastry fix when I stumbled on this one in the Noda district. Walking through the door you're greeted with an eclectic decor that I the only way I might be able to describe would be chic french hipster.

They have an interesting and varied selection of pastries and chocolates that were fun to look at and delicious as well! I went for lunch with a friend and she had the ginger rice soup, and I had the asparagus leek soup. I'm not a fan of ginger so her soup was ok, but the asparagus leek soup was excellent! Creamy and smooth it was a dream. We also split a croque monsieur and it was done perfectly. Greasy, a little crisp on the outside, with the mustard giving a nice kick to the sandwich.

Now for the dessert portion we had a strawberry and chocolate croissant, salted caramel brownie, and creme brulee with a small french press. I feel like the strawberry and chocolate croissants could have used a little more filling but they were quite good. The salted caramel brownie I really needed more salt to cut through the creamy sugar of the caramel, but then again I tend to like my snacks a bit less sweet. The creme brulee was the winner of the dessert round. Nice and crisply caramelized top with a not too sweet center.

Amelie's was a great find in the Noda area and offers free wifi, a nice place to relax, and a varied crowd with pastry choices for everyone. It's now on my list of places to visit frequently!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and decor of this place - and the food is delicious ! I try to eat healthy when I travel so o added salmon to their pear salad - it was sweet, savory and filling! I also tried one of their signature iced café drinks which did not disappoint! It looks like I'll be coming here quite often on my trip"}
{"text":"Today I was transported to Paris and it was delicious. All matter of pastries from tarts, to pies to mini cakes, to cupcakes to 
macarons and all types of coffee and espresso. The decor transforms you to an 
eclectic Parisian cafe with mixed match tables and chairs and decor and lighting that makes this place easily a favorite. 

And did I mention that it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"stopped here for lunch. lots of seating and cool decor.  got a sandwich, lavendar + honey iced soda,  and 3 different flavored macarons.  sandwich and the drink were good. 

the macarons.. I was extremely disappointed. one was really chewy,  one was hard like a cracker, and one was just sticky. they were all too big and sweet. I can safely say that they were the worst macarons I've ever tasted. 

still 3 stars because I dig the vibe and the food/drink was good. just don't get the macarons."}
{"text":"Amélie's is a quirky 24-hour French bakery in the arts district of Charlotte.  The place is decorated with mismatched French-themed art and furniture, and the crowd Amélie's attracts is diverse as well.

I was visiting my cousin for the weekend, and we stopped by twice - Saturday night and Sunday afternoon.  Saturday night was packed with the line wrapping around to the other room (and I'm told it is usually busy like this during the later hours of the evening).  Sunday wasn't as packed but still busy with customers.

Saturday night I got the crème brûlée, and on Sunday I bought a coffee and a variety of pastries to take home to Virginia Beach.  Next time I come, I hope to try some of their hot sandwiches and get a frozen baguette to bake at home."}
{"text":"I chanced upon this delightful bakery and cafe while in Charlotte for a P.E.O. convention. First of all, the decor is eclectic and charming. The first evening, we sat outside at little tables that truly made it feel like you were at a Parisian street cafe. Delightful. I had a soup that was light but filling at the same time. I think it was spinach, leek, and asparagus. So tasty! Dessert was a tough choice as the display cases are loaded with rows of beautifully presented pastries and sweet treats. The peach tart I settled on was fantastic. Flaky and full of peach flavor. Before flying out this morning, my friends and I planned to have breakfast at our hotel - until we saw the uninspired menu and typically jacked up prices. On a hunch, we decided to check to see if Amelie's would be open, though we held out little hope, as we'd been told all of downtown closes on Sundays. Turns out my new favorite place is open twenty four hours a day, every day. Awesome! My friend and I both had different flavors of quiche. Mine was asparagus and manchego cheese - hers bacon and some other kind of cheese. I don't even normally order quiches in restaurants because I hate when they come out in a runny consistency. Not to worry here - the quiches were amazing. The staff is ready to help with any questions or needs. They are friendly and professional. In between eating all the delicious, excellently prepared foods it's just plain fun to look around and see all the whimsical decorating touches. Amelie's, can you branch out to Kansas City???????"}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP THE MACARONS ARE AMAZING. My friends recently visited and brought back a whole bag full of sweets and Amelie's was one of their stops. Usually, I'm not a macaron fan because most places make them overly sweet with the sugary shells AND the even more sugary filling; not this place. The balance is equal between not sweet enough and sweet and it results in fireworks... in my mouth, lol!"}
{"text":"If I could come here every day for the rest of my life, I think I would. If I could live in this restaurant, I think I would. If that puts anything into perspective. 

We came here for a sweet bite after dinner. First, walking in you are just taken aback by the decor. This place is HUGE and full of unique lights, artwork, and seating. There are different rooms and levels to sit in, each with cool aesthetics. We ordered macrons and their infamous salted caramel brownie. They have so many different flavors of macrons, and the ones we chose were all so friggin tasty. The brownie was very delicious as well. 

They also have a wine and beer bar, which would be fun to come back to and try out. They also serve food! Seriously, they have everything you could ever need in this place. Love, love, LOVE."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I am on a strict diet but that doesn't mean I cannot enjoy the smells!!!!!
Awesome. Nice friendly staff. Very clean and a great location!!! Love the Noda area!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a few pastries from this shoppe. Simply delicious!!!! Simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Best dessert place ever.  Period.  Gets a little freaky late at night, if you are into that stuff."}
{"text":"The service is such shit, no matter how many new people they hire, I assume, since it's different staff everytime I'm here. Literally everytime I'm here they fuck up my drink order, and all I get is fucking milk. A glass of milk which they ask if I want in a glass or or plastic cup. I always say glass, and get plastic. Like Jesus fuck I'm posting this from your bakery because it has just happened again. And the pistachio macaroons are hard as fucking rocks."}
{"text":"My favorite of all the locations due to the ambience. I love the desserts but the creative environment is great for writing, inspiration, and people watching of course!"}
{"text":"Oh my God. This place is beautifully eclectic, but let me tell you what won me over the most - the HEART with which this place was designed: 
1. Has a special handicap elevator for wheelchairs
2. Gender non-specific bathrooms

And so much personality! While it's VERY French inspired, the ambiance is really a hodgepodge. Sort of Paris, sort of hipster, sort of a lot of things!

It's a HUGE SPACE! Lots of seating throughout and different areas of the bakery have a different vibe. Never seen a bakery/coffee shop like it before. The bakers work behind glass screens so you can watch them pour batter in and out of huge pots, and it's super fun.

I tried their spiced chai and it was really great! They have an assortment of drinks and desserts. I didn't try any of their desserts after a heavy brunch beforehand, but will DEFINITELY be back when Im in Charlotte again!

We went Saturday mid-afternoon, and there was no line!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs!
Love all the pasteries and breads. My favorites: Lemon curd raspberry tart, french style macaroons, and their the eclairs.  the only thing they get wrong is the cofee.  As you get older and your tastebuds start to die like the rest of you, you need a really good cup of cofee. There cofee and espresso is week and they have no decaf espresso. If that changes it would definately merrit 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The environment is really nice and lots of creativity is put into the decorations. I always get the   *Chocolate dipped strawberry cup with mousse - must try! The cake and brownies were okay ( it wasn't soft and moist). Cute little place to hangout and service was good."}
{"text":"No vegan options? NONE?! One star for you! Lines are always too long, counter people always act too cool for school. Even their dark melange coffee and lavender lemonade which is heaven can't make up for all the other cons. Booooo!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service. You obviously don't need any sort of intelligence to work here. Miserable people."}
{"text":"Great cold brew coffee! If you never had cold brew coffee you would never go back. Oh, and the pastries are Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"When you get your first sip of coffee and know without a doubt you will be ordering another before leaving, you know you've found your new fav place. Wonderful service, the atmosphere is eclectic and fun. The blt croissant is to die for."}
{"text":"Very kitschy place, but a lot of the pastries were uneventful at best, and mostly underwhelming. Tried the caramel apple petit gateaux (picture) and it was one of the better options. Petit fours were good, and so was the mulled wine. Nice spot for a cute date place, but I'm not convinced it's the best place around."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. What a cute, unique spot! It looks like a tiny bakery when you walk in the door and it continues back and has a ton of seating. Great spot for coffee, work remotely, enjoy some time with friends."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday for a late breakfast.  Was definitely more impressed this time around.  I had a breakfast sandwich w/egg, bacon, spinach and mozzarella on a baguette, and one of the lemon cream cheese filled pastries.

The lemon cream cheese pastry was sooo good.  The outside was flaky and light and the filling that had the perfect lemon flavoring, not too strong or too light.  The breakfast sandwich was also really good, though I think if I had added tomato it would have given it the little something I felt it was missing.  My friends had an eclair and they loved it along w/another breakfast sandwich and the roast beef w/boursin on a croissant and they both really enjoyed.

Happy I gave Amelie's another chance and it exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"A great spot with all your Amelies must haves including gluten-free salted caramel brownies. The wine, beer and alcoholic beverages all sound amazing. Coffee, sandwiches and all the pastries you could want. 

Fun decor including a macaroon chandelier too! I have a feeling I will be here very often."}
{"text":"I love me some Amelie's and am happy to have this location near my home. This location does have a wine bar, so that's a plus! There are some couches and comfy chairs, and a few larger tables, but overall I feel like there's not enough space to spread out and hunker down to get work done. However, I agree that the food isn't quite the same as I am used to in Noda. There are some gluten free options for desserts and gluten free bread for sandwiches so that's good."}
{"text":"Delicious treats, eclectic decor. They have a good selection of gluten free dessert options and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Another awesome amelies. 

Great space, including a patio. Lots of fun places to sit and enjoy delicious baked goods, all sorts of chandeliers and decor. 

Local beer, wine, cocktails, drinks, dessert case, and the menu of \"real food\". Every time I have been the staff have been very friendly. 

You can see into the kitchen and watch the bakers decorate or make macaroons. 

There's a space downstairs with another bar, and a space you can rent upstairs."}
{"text":"First time to this location, but I'm a regular at the larger NoDa store.  Great coffee, great pastries, tasty sandwiches, and eccentrically decorated interior - what more could you want?  this location looks pretty vanilla from the outside, but it's fun inside."}
{"text":"Great late night place to hang out, have a coffee, catch up on work or homework.  Great sweets choice, eclectic decor and eclectic clientele (at least at night - it's midnight as I write this).  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Sunday, and it looked like nothing else was about around it for blocks. Apparently it's known for it's salted caramel brownie, which I ordered but found good, but overrated. I also had a chocolate layer cake with ganache, and that was the real star of the show. Yeah... I ate two sweets in one sitting. Don't judge me.

Also, outdoor seating was great-- perfect really. Indoor seating I found a little too loud for my tastes.  Coffee is European style, so keep that in mind when you order."}
{"text":"I really enjoy having family and friend time here. The atmosphere is welcoming, with indoor and outdoor seating. I have had lunch here before, and many pastries! At Thanksgiving, I brought a pecan tart from here and was a total hit. Recently when I have been going, the pastries have been lacking flavor. They sound delicious, and have somewhat of a disappointment. I had a pumpkin spice cream puff, which lacked pumpkin flavor. Most recent I had a Neapolitan, which had a great white chocolate flavor on top, but the rest was tasteless. My salted caramel brownie latte was delicious. Two pastries and two drinks were $25."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. I was expecting more \"french\" in my pastry. I feel a little intimidated posting this but I thought you might want to know - it's not that special. (Carmel Commons location.)"}
{"text":"So I basically come to Amelie's almost daily because I work nearby and it's the only \"decent\" food I have access to without having to drive someplace. Mostly I order the breakfast sandwiches on a croissant which are delicious. Sometimes I'll order lunch and the Seeded Roast Beef is great. The consistency of the food items (not the bakery) and especially the soups are hit or miss for me.  I feel like it depends on who's cooking or preparing whether or not my asiago is melted on my sandwich or if the Leek soup tastes like high blood pressure. Some days the food is yum and also I've thrown away my share of barely eaten food on others. I'm a simple dessert kinda lady so all fruity concoctions are not my proverbial cup of tea but I have been known to get down on a cinnamon stick or 2 or 5 but who's counting?! Can I take off stars for side effects like gaining 10lbs? 

The other thing is the price. Amelies is expensive. Today I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant and a coffee and it was $9. Most days I spend closer to $15. I get it--it's all French Bakery Swanky but dang! I like Amelie's enough to keep eating here but if I had more choices around I'd probably choose them more."}
{"text":"What an eclectic place! Full of mismatched furniture and friendly people, this place is great. I was recommended to come here by many of the locals. They're known for their salted caramel brownie with over 1,270,681 sold! I haven't tried mine yet but I'm sure it will not disappoint. This location is open 24 hours and plays hip music with a variety of places to sit and get work done. I got the yogurt and granola with berries and it was on point. Coffee is delicious. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a wonderful place. Open 24 hours, and offering good coffee and lots of seating, this is a staple go-hang-out-and-read spot. As anyone will tell you, you have to have the salted caramel brownie. They made them for the White House for goodness sakes.

Minus 1 star, only because it is so frequently true that the line is unbearably long. Obviously that is also a testament to the value of the place. But it's almost like standing in line for a roller coaster."}
{"text":"Must hit place in Charlotte and doesn't hurt that it's located by all things cool in Noda! Open 24 hours, there's never an off-time (although there are many ON times, with a line reaching into separate rooms). You'll know you're in the right spot right away, with all the creative artwork and antique pieces, I've heard it feels just like France (although I will verify AFTER my future visit!) The restaurant is made up of 3 rooms with an eclectic array of chairs and tables. Free wifi, and water too and you'll find outlets along the walls for the necessary charge [NOTE: I discovered the back room gets the best reception during my visit!]

You'll walk in and immediately be greeted by a glass counter filled with goodies: pastries and sweet treats. But that's not all that Amelie offers! They've got a breakfast and lunch menu filled with sandwiches, quiche and coffee/teas. I recommend the turkey and brie sandwich, it's served on a baguette with a seedy raspberry jam. I've tried an assortment of treats and much say I need to keep trying! The Napoleon was too messy and tricky to eat: you really need to let it heat up but it falls apart really easily. I also tried a fruit (maybe orange) and tarragon macaron recently that was just ok on flavor although great texture. The downside is that Amelie's is pretty pricy when it comes to their bakery, so you can't go too crazy without the bill going crazy. I'll keep returning until I find the perfect combination, you really can't get over the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"What is not to like about this place?  a cool place to hang out after a dinner or show.  Great eats and lovely coffee.  We got the salted caramel brownie and a couple macaroons and washed it all down with a latte.

I want to try all their sweets.

A cool dessert date spot."}
{"text":"I love to stop by this place for a quick cup of tea but I frequently get pulled into staring at the pastries and can't leave without one! I've never had one I didn't like. Their sandwiches are great too for breakfast and lunch! I have seen them run out of croissants though and then the sandwiches are only on the harder bread which I don't love. The atmosphere is perfect to relax or get work done!"}
{"text":"We are in love. The long line was a bummer but so worth the wait. The pumpkin salted Carmel muffin was the best muffin I have ever had- moist, full of flavor, and so beautiful. The chocolate moose was yummy. Love love love the servers bring our food to the table with a smile and southern charm. The Salad was fresh and filling great portion of chicken for 2$! Really enjoyed the bri and turkey Meal but be ready for it to be sweet. I loved it but not for everyone. This is a gem!"}
{"text":"Trendy and a nice place to relax with a coffee and croissant.  However, their service is never friendly in any of the locations I've been to (I've been to two) and they are very pricey for what you get.  If you order a large latte with no foam, you get about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup so I always feel a little cheated."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons I love Amelie's. First of all of course the food is amazing!  They have a wide range of French pastries and the variety is mind boggling. There is definitely something for everyone.  My favorites being the palmier and the raspberry fruit tie. They also have incredible tarts, eclairs, petit fours, mini cakes or gateaux, brownies, macaroons, etc.  Then there are the savory treats.  They seem to be most proud of their soups like the spinach asparagus leek and sweet potato bisque.  While the soup is pretty great and my favorite thing on a rainy or cold day I am in love with the baguette and croissant sandwhiches.  You can get them with ham or jambon, eggs, spinach, tomato, or cheese or any combination.  My favorite cheeses being a tie between brie and gueyere.  There is some outside seating but the inside is a virtual modern french salon with very chic and creative decor.  Amelie's has more than one location now, but the orginal on North Davidson is my favorite and it's open TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY!  I havn't even gotten a chance to mention free Wi Fi, lavander infused sparkling lemonade, and flourless chocolate cake so you will have to just go yourself and make your own discoveries!"}
{"text":"Love the deserts and the soup and sandwiches, this place is definitely serving some delicious food but the long waits to purchase and hard time finding a place to seat inside is a  turn off for me."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! This may be my favorite coffee shop in the entire U.S. The food was delicious and the coffee was pretty good. The vibe and ambience however is amazing. It borders between kitsch and eclectically cute. I could spend all day here--there are so many amazing little nooks to discover."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. I got a latte it was delicious. Al though I did not get any pastries. Next I will because it looked so good 

It's not star bucks so the prices is a little pricey but they do have free wifi. First refill in coffee or tea is free and after that it's a $1 each refill. 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced and the staff can be snooty, but no where near as snooty as the customers.  $26 for 4 items, none of which was larger than bagel.  Not going back anytime soon.  Oh and the coffee, yeah um, NO!  Weak and plain, even the flavored ones lack flavor.
We were standing next to a lady from France while waiting in line, I asked her if the items were truly French, she told me \"well they look French but that's about all\".  Good enough for me"}
{"text":"This place is wow!! They have a surprisingly large selection of pastries and cakes! And they all look so amazing; it's hard to walk into this place and not get dessert. Usually I go for the sandwiches and coffee, which are also very wow. The sandwich I ordered had cheese and raspberry jam, which was way more amazing than I expected! I'd absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Pastries and the BEST gluten free Breakfast sandwich that I have ever had. I would highly recommend this. It's a good spot if you need to study, want to have coffee with a friend, are in a hurry but want a good breakfast to go, and it will fulfill your sweet tooth and exceed your expectations. I LOVE the gluten free options. It is so nice to have a place that offers not only gluten free, but delicious gluten free options."}
{"text":"People go to Amelie's because it's \"cool\" and to be frank, it is a pretty cool place. The place is covered in quirky and fun decor from an Etch-A-Sketch art piece to Joseph Ducreux marking where the line for ordering begins. Not to mention there are always a half dozen people on their laptops and usually a guy out in the atrium strumming along his guitar. One might say that at Amelie's you feel cooler than cool. (You might even feel ice cold. Alright, alright?)

Amelie's is always packed. ALWAYS. I don't think I've ever seen the place even remotely quiet -- not even during the later hours. Except to wait a while in line to order because yes, it does stretch around to the other room sometimes. 

While there's no denying Amelie's atmosphere is fantastic, I'm not quiet sure what the hype about their food is all about. Their desserts are pretty hit or miss. The macarons are particularly disappointing. I like my macarons with a hard outer shell and a soft fluffy on the inside. Amelie's macarons have the consistency of hard cookies. I have, however, enjoyed some of their mini cakes and mousse cups. Their non-dessert food (or \"non-fun\" food if you've got a sweet tooth like me) is pretty solid as well. Be aware that their baguettes are huge and you might want to have a buddy help you out. (Or not. I'm not here to judge.) 

I'm not a coffee drinker but the my friends that are have not had any issues with the coffee. The tea is also very nice and is loose leaf, not bagged. They also have speciality sodas and drinks that change seasonally.  

Amelie's isn't too far off in price from Starbucks and while some of their desserts have disappointed me, it's worth stopping here rather than your local Starbucks if you've got the chance. While Amelie's isn't the holy grail of cafes or bakeries, it's worth checking out. Because, afterall, what's cooler than being cool? Amelie's."}
{"text":"Amelie's is always the first place I take anyone who is visiting, and once they go they always want to go back. This is a Charlotte signature place, you have to hit it!!! Amazing wonderful eclectic over the top awesome decor, and there is not one bad thing on the entire menu, I mean it. Eclairs, macaroons, oh the napoleons. But let me say, my favorite might be the soups!!! And quiche!! So incredible. All the sandwiches, and don't forget the French sodas.. Lavender blackberry today for me :)"}
{"text":"They have the perfect location. The baristas take pride in their work and so do the bakers. Every food and drink item is done properly and seems always fresh. The cool unique atmosphere is awesome and the open space provides more privacy at your seat/table. I cannot say it is better than the NoDa location but it provides a different vibe given all the space. My only complaint is that the small pastries might be overpriced."}
{"text":"24 hours works for anybody, the seating areas are the coolest, and I always enjoy whatever I order"}
{"text":"Stopped in for something sweet.  Everything that our party had was excellent.  The vanilla eclair and the macaroons were out of this world.  Not a lot of seating, so may be right at peak times.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!  Located in what appears to a updated warehouse with an restaurant and a brewery across the street, Amelie's bakery has a vast range of desserts, pastries, petit fours, macaroons, along with omelette and various breakfast items.  Soups and coffees round out the list.  The interior is eclectic bohemian and French influences, so you become immediately cooler.  Here is the clincher...they're open 24/7!!!!  Now if you're fancy, you can still find phenomenal food post drinking or anytime. I don't know how they do it but the flow of people is pretty steady and they're on top of it.  Very impressed with the food and the service."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on the way home to satisfy my special lady wife's need for sweets after two stops indulging my own beer needs. 

i was surprised at the crowd just before 9 o'clock on a Thursday night. i really had not read anything about this place and had driven by countless times having no clue it even existed. The cluster of ooglers and droolers deciding what to order wasn't ideal, but some dude took our order and moved us along.  i just told him i wanted something chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate. Whatever he picked out was perfect. The chocolate mousse-stuff went nicely with my Abita Jockamo IPA and the latest episode of Big Brother. All in all, our order was like $13 for 2 little bites and two bigger treats. Thanks be to the Entertainment Book for $5 off, bringing the total to $8."}
{"text":"Some Parisians disagree, I still LOVE this place! Whew, this is a great place to fall in LOVE!  Amour, Amour!  Open 24 hours a day!!!  Every Day!   

Some say Shabby Chic, I say Eclectic Cool and very ROMANTIC!  Great place to take a date or Meet a date!  Today was my 8th Visit (I'm really counting!!! - No Joke).  We (four adults two children) had a: Honey Bun, Creme Brulee, Fruit Tart, Chocolate Layered Torte and a Salted Carmel Brownie... All were Fantastic!!!  Of these the only one I have had before was the Fruit Torte...  All of these choices I would repeat!!!  The Chocolate Layered Torte was my favorite!

Service is always incredibly friendly, patient and Fantastic!  Great place to fall in LOVE, look like you are or eat like you are not or are!  I have experienced each here, some more than others, most more than others!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my sandwich and pastry. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Very long wait for a so-so meal. It was lunch time so the wait was understandable but I couldn't quite justify the $17 I spent on my lunch.

The BLT had one small slice of tomato, one strip of bacon cut in half and lettuce. I do have to say that the croissant was nice and flakey.

The tomato fennel soup was inedible. I LOVE tomato soup (not canned) and was more excited to dig into it than the sandwich but a giant spoonful left me reliving my last, unfortunate childhood experience with Chef Boyardee. It tasted just like canned spaghetti Os. I left the entire cup. 

Lavendar lemonade? Pass. I didn't really taste the lavendar. 

The 2 stars are for ambiance and the phenomenal pumpkin cream puff I took back to the hotel. I am more than likely to go back for the pastries only before flying out. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Worth the visit! Everything I had was great. The breakfast sandwich/croissant with bacon and I forget the cheese, was awesome. Lemonade a la lavender, superb, along with the macaroon! 

The decor was pretty sweet and it just had that character you want in a good eatery. The guys working there are cool and I had a chat with 3 of them at different stages. All of them told me stuff to do around the area and were super chilled out humble guys. 

I then ordered the orange blossom iced tea and sat outside in the sun. Brilliant tea paired nicely with the mild sun and I was having a ball. 

Character and enjoyment, people! That's what it's all about! The only bad thing that happened is some lady ordered a diet coke haha. None of the workers mind that, you're free to make your own decisions after all, but shit that's a bad call, ordering coke when you have the craftsmanship of these people!

Respect to the people at Amelie's!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I just..I mean how can I..well it's...Delicious!

A jewel of a location in Charlotte.  I only had a day in Charlotte and I visited here twice...really.  I grabbed a quick croissant to go after hitting town from Raleigh.  After my first bite & then a post on Facebook that generated several comments...such as get the salted caramel brownie and many others I knew I would be stopping by on my way out of town.

I did.  And had beautiful sugar shock during my drive back.

Macaroons, fruit tarts, and that brownie...I tried a little of each and saved some for another day.

Open 24 hours.  Really."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Charlotte (sadly). They get like 3 bucks for one macaroon. The same thing in Boston,  New York or Chicago wouldn't be a 3rd the cost at double the quality,  but hey...  You get to rip people off when you are the only game in town, right? 

Overall quality is below average for a major market, but above average for Charlotte, so take that for what it is worth."}
{"text":"My friend said a general rule of thumb is that if something looks good here, it is. I tried A LOT of stuff and everything was really good. 

Workers are hit or miss. Some of them were knowledgeable, and others just don't care. I asked one worker what the flavors of the chocolate cups were. She said, \"I don't know\". I waited and then she started guessing on a few of them but trailed off. I pointed at one, and I said, \"The one with the almond. Is that almond?\" and she said, \"Yeah, I think so.\" I think her name was Mac. I wish she had a nametag on that said, \"Don't ask me\". She could have also easily asked the guy next to her.

I highly recommend the chocolate cups. My favorite was the passion fruit one. And the French macaroons (macarons)... sooo good. I prefer the cream ones and my favorite was pistachio. I didn't like the cinnamon-sugar one - too grainy. I wish I had bought a gazillion and stuffed them in my suitcase to bring back with me. 

Go here! You will not regret it. Just be careful, with this combo of deliciousness and semi-priceyness, you might go broke."}
{"text":"It's a good thing that I live over 2 hours away from here, because the ability to get an amazing pastry 24/7 is a temptation that I would fall for way too often.

When we arrived around 9:30AM, I was expecting at least a little bit of a wait, but to my surprise we didn't wait at all! Maybe we got lucky? The only thing that delayed our breakfast was our indecision when staring at the huge case of pastries and sweets. I eventually settled on the twice baked chocolate croissant to pair with a latte for breakfast. The croissant was crispy, buttery, and chocolatey. I do not recommend for sharing, because you will want to eat it all. Or maybe I'm just greedy. And I couldn't pick just one thing to try, so I also got a box of goodies to take home and indulge on later. I ordered a couple of their sea salt caramel brownies, since those are their best-sellers (for good reason). And then I also ordered a chocolate éclair and a lemon raspberry tart. The cream in the éclair was absolute perfection and the tart had the perfect balance of lemon and raspberry. I really don't think you can order wrong. 

The staff was very friendly and helped me make up my mind based on my love for chocolate. They also didn't get frustrated with me after I stared at the case for an inordinate amount of time trying to make my selections. They were also very well staffed and prepared to handle a big crowd that would likely be coming in for brunch.

The décor and seating area has mismatched tables, chairs, and lights but in a way that works. At one table it feels like you are sitting in a dining room and another couch makes you feel like you're in your living room. Since it has such a home-y feel, it is a great low-key spot to socialize or even study. 

After trying these marvelous goodies, I will certainly be making a stop in here EVERY time I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I am SO happy this place exists close to me! I had macaroons the first time, and can't wait to go back for more pastries and baguettes!"}
{"text":"Good food long lines at night. The lines move fast though and the pastries are pretty tasty the macaroons are one of my favorite items there. Be prepared to spend money though."}
{"text":"Amélie's was one of the highlights of our trip to Charlotte!
Not only is the atmosphere eclectic and charming, it's what I'd imagine any great bakery in France would be. 

All of their desserts are made there and believe it or not, this was my first time ever having a macaroon! But I have to say, I'm happy Amélie's was where it first happened. 

My husband and I not only shared three of their dozens of different types of pastries but we also shared a French press. I loved it! They served it to us on a silver plater with all the accomplishments we needed. Such a great deal as well, we both we were able to have two cups and still have coffee left. 

Amélie's came highly recommended to us before leaving Charlotte and I'm happy we did. It's truly a Charlotte gem."}
{"text":"Yum! I love the coffee here and the atmosphere is really nice! Lots of chill people and plenty of munchies"}
{"text":"Was just ok. Out of elderflower juice for the golden french mimosa, forgot the egg on the breakfast sandwich, my Turkey & Brie wasn't warm"}
{"text":"i do like the sandwichs but not the sweets.    i always wanna know the recipe of chicken salad!   however ,the owner wont tell me about it.  this bakery is busy all the time.thats amazing"}
{"text":"This has to be the best kept little secret in Charlotte! I only recently visited Amelies for the very first time. My daughter is a hair stylist in NoDa and asked if I'd go with her to grab some french pastries on her lunch break. I was so delighted by the atmosphere with chandeliers and colorful decor. They have plenty of parking and many delicious pastries, sandwiches, soups, quiches and salads to offer! I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to see the whole menu however I believe they also offer a great selection of coffee and beverages. My fruit tart was amazing! The only complaint I have is that it was very busy and the line was really long so it took awhile just to order food, then had to wait for it to be prepared and brought out to us. We spent 30 minutes in total, and was only expecting a quick 10-15 minute stop to grab some take out. If you are in a rush, be sure to allow a little more time to get thru the line, and I'm sure they are always very busy at the lunch hour, which is when I went. Will definitely go again and next time I'll plan to stay a bit longer and also try a hot coffee latte."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. 
The ambiance at either the Uptown and NoDa location are so fun. I love the eclectic Parisian theme with the odds and unmatched furniture and décor. Whether stopping in for a meeting and coffee or enjoying a glass of wine after work with a salted caramel brownie, this is the place to be. The place is huge and has tons of seating as well as a great outdoor patio I love to sit in and people watch.
The service is always friendly and the desserts make me feel like I've stepped into a European bakery. If stopping in for lunch, this is a great place for a light sandwich and soup, but isn't the best spot if you're looking for big portions. The breakfast sandwiches are delightful.
I love the uptown location because you can watch the staff create all of the delicious desserts that you serve. I am telling you NOT to get a window seat if you are on a diet. One look at the salted caramel being swiped over the tin of brownies and I'm DONE.
The macaroons are delicious and the perfect amount of chewy and light. The only thing I would call out to the staff is it would be great if the staff could label the kinds of macaroons. It gets old in line hearing the poor staff member recite each flavor over and over. Sure, yellow is easy to imagine would be lemon, but do you know how many potential flavors light brown macaroons could be? Cappuccino? Chocolate? Spicy hot chocolate?  
The only reason I gave a four instead of 5 stars is because the bathrooms aren't always the cleanest. Which is shocking! This is the Uptown location of professionals and tourists. It's a bit surprising that it is not kept in top shape for a gorgeous French bakery!"}
{"text":"While in the area I had to stop here and I am glad I did. Loved the shabby chic kind of decor. It was busy & some items were sold down, but we got the salted caramel brownie, almond cakes & a chocolate raspberry tart. Love love loved them all especially the almond cake, but I am a sucker for almond paste :) cake was really moist and almondy. I was disappointed that there were only 3 flavors of macarons that day but C'est la vie. All in all a great place."}
{"text":"Great selection of French baked goods

Had the Cream Puff and Fruit Tart. Some of the best cream ever. This stuff was delicious and went everywhere. 

They have a lot of tea and coffee options. Really wanted to get a coffee but it was late in the day and I didn't want to jeopardize my beauty sleep."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee (and chai) and service, BEAUTIFUL pastries made in-house.  Pastries are delicious, light, and not overpoweringly rich.  Sandwiches are good, but portions are small, so count on it being more of a snack than a full meal (which is often what I'm looking for).  Possibly on the pricey side for their food items."}
{"text":"Having Amelie's so close to my work is dangerous. I mean, I love the fact that I can just walk over to enjoy a flowery lemonade or salted caramel brownie, but damn...that bakery display is just too tempting. I see people going in and buying a single macaroon, and I'm like 'Really?'...cut to me filling up a bakery box 'to take home' (yeah, right) with an assortment of sweet delights. 

The sandwiches and tartines are also a danger...and the soups! Some faves:
-Bacon and Brie Tartine (seasonal specialty, if they have it, get it!)
-Croque Monsieur
-Leek and Asparagus Soup"}
{"text":"I'd honestly like to live at Amelie's. The staff is thoughtful and friendly, the food is excellent, the coffee is killer (I had one of their innovative seasonal offerings), and the decor is spectacularly quirky. It is a must do and must see for Downtown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Love the sweets, coffee, and tea. The atmosphere is so awesome. Virtually everything available is great, even the food. 

Zero complaints."}
{"text":"I have 2 words when it comes to this bakery : TEA CAKES! I've been to this establishment plenty of times and decided to finally leave a review. If you have a sweet tooth, you will be in heaven once you walk through the doors and Feast your eyes on the display case of sweets . I've tried a number of different treats here but my fav are the almond tea cakes! They are light, buttery with a crunchy top filled with almonds , really addicting! Every time I go I buy the WHOLE tray of whatever they have left, along with their BLT on a croissant and a chai tea latte w/ whip cream. The BLT never disappoints, the croissant is flaky and light and the bacon is baked til crispy. The chai tea latte is better than Starbucks, savory and lightly sweet with a hint of cinnamon. This place is the perfect after \"date\" spot when you don't want to go home just yet"}
{"text":"I would always take friends here when they visit me in Charlotte and I would recommend the fruit tarts. They're pretty much the most delicious things in that bakery. I'd also recommend coming here late at night after clubbing downtown because it's open 24hrs. I definitely stopped by at around 1 or 2am and they still had a decent selection of sweets, food, and drinks available. Some of the other stuff are really sweet for me, though, and it's a bit overpriced, but I would say this is a good place to come to."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the 1st time yesterday & it's a winner. I work in uptown Charlotte & wanted a sandwich but not the typical chain stuff. I had the seeded roast beef with horseradish & potato salad. The sandwich was spot on. Very good fresh bread, good roast beef (& I can be picky about my roast beef!). With this location being below the CK YMCA I think it'll be a regular stop for food after a workout!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan for YEARS! Its always so wonderful to go into Amelie's and just relax"}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best. The food wasn't exactly fresh. All three times that I've eaten here have proven to be just...meh...despite all of the pastries and the decor. The confectionaries that I've purchased have, every single time, had a stale refrigerator taste to them. There are also many inconsiderate patrons who don't seem to understand the concept of manners (ie saying excuse me when bumping in to you). The coffee is mediocre, as well...they're trying to be a master of all trades...instead, I'd say they're a jack of them all, a master of none.  Stick to one thing - you've outdone yourselves."}
{"text":"I love coming here after dinner or a night out!  Great desserts and cute decor! Good date place too! I usually get a few things when I'm here to take home and enjoy these baked goodies for the next few days."}
{"text":"Absolutely darling of a cafe! Huge interior with plenty of space to either chat with a friend or study in peace! This bakery (which sells more than just baked goods) is a creative's eclectic dream, and when you walk in you immediately feel like you're backstage at some grand theatre. I tried the latte (nothing special) and some of the fruit tarts (all so good!) and loved the overall atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"Delicious, but the hipster employees don't reflect the cheery Facebook updates the bakery posts when you are ordering.  The pastries and desserts are a 5... The employees are 3."}
{"text":"i did not like this place at all the food was okay but i can make better stuff at my house . The staff was very rude and the bathroom was dirty and had no towels"}
{"text":"Good desserts and nice cool, calm atmosphere!"}
{"text":"With 259 previous reviews, I'm not sure I can add much more but I'm going to give it a whirl!  Amelies is an ecclectic, unique french bakery located in the heart of NoDa.  However, unlike other favorite NoDa spots, Amelies has a private parking lot.  And, I do appreciate that since I was towed once having dinner at Cabo Fish Taco, but I digress.  Highlights: open 24 hours a day, free wi-fi access, amazing pastries, delicious sandwiches if you're a tad more hungry, and some great coffees!  Perhaps I'm most appreciative of the oversized, comfy couches and chairs located toward the back of the bakery.  I just melt right into them and then don't want to do any school work which is usually my intent when I make the trek into visit.  

The staff have always been very friendly.  However, I'm not totally clear on whether you are supposed to leave your dishes behind or find one of those dishes buckets and put things away yourself.  I get the sense that either is acceptable.

The art work, antiques, piano and other trinkets are always fun to look at!  I'd recommend coming to Amelie's for: 1) some after bar hopping treats, 2) a place to bunker in and do some work with the free wi-fi and pastries, and 3) the dessert ending to a perfect date!"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff, bright, and clean. And they had my twice baked almond croissant (that has been so hard for me to get)! Also had the limonade classique (fresh squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup, club soda). It was perfect and tart!"}
{"text":"Amélies is a cute little restaurant. The decor is fun to look at but as far as French pastries go, Amélies is just  ok. The palmier is good but the chocolate eclair and Napoleon we had did t get finished because they were less than ok. The Napoleon topping and crust were ok but the cream had no flavor. I'm sitting there waiting for the vanilla to kick in but nothing, very flat. The eclair had a good chocolate topping and the filling did have a good vanilla flavor but the crust was bland.  We didn't ha e anything else to go by and we did see quite a few people eating there so maybe we just had a few deserts that weren't as good this time.  The next time I'm in Charlotte I wouldn't mind giving them another try."}
{"text":"Okay so, everyone loves to come here and work. It is either quiet enough or has a low noise volume to the point where it is so pleasant to come in and work on your laptop. It is hard to find a space to work, but once you find it, you can at least get cozy with your coffee and food. There is something here for everyone. I love the mochas and the macaroons. My go to is the mixed berry tart or the pecan tart."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to grab some french pastries,  coffee,  they also have a bar that serve beer n wine! Awesome.  I  went there today had they cream brulee cold drink, with sparkle it was so good, with a mini pumpkin tarte, hubby had chai tea, with chocolate pastries,  was very good too, will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in town and want to try some French pastries."}
{"text":"Shop local!  This is an awesome spot to grab a cup of coffee, a sweet treat, some lunch or breakfast.  Great, unique atmosphere and funky seating.  I love meeting clients here - since I have a creative business, I like to take them to a creative and local place.  This is tucked away at the end of a commercial shopping center, so a little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Love this new location! Has all the charm of the NODA location, just a lot more spacious with lots of seating and a nice long bar. There are three (I think) lines. If you're ordering dessert, make sure you get in the line closest to the pastries. All the servers were super friendly and smiley. Even though it was crowded, our order came out quickly. I've only been to this new location once but I had a great experience. Great addition to Uptown."}
{"text":"I travel across the country for work and have been to many French bakeries. Amelie's is as good as any other.  I've never had anything that I didn't like. Coffee is great, macaroons are delicious and they have the best Napoleon I've ever ate.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Monkey bread was delicious!  Hot chocolate was creamy and yummy. Fairly busy for mid-afternoon on a Saturday. Casual and comfortable."}
{"text":"Food is good. The line is never worth the wait. Nothing different than what you get in other major city's bakeries but it is the only gig in town for what they make."}
{"text":"I was recommend by a local to come to this location. I'd have to say the quality of service was terrible. I was not greeted. No one standing in line but yet I was rushed. As if I should have known to not ask questions to the cashier. I was confused as the amount of money being charged and asked that she repeat order. And I had to tell her she was adding items from another incoming party. After leaving I reviewed the pastries and bill and still had other charges. I had to return to have them correct it. 

I purchased 4 chocolate crossiants, eclair, apple turnover,  brownie. Perhaps it was an old batch but not impressed with either items. Too dry."}
{"text":"Great breakfast or casual lunch spot!! You order at the counter then they bring your food out to you. The line moves verrrry slowly when I was there - only 1 gal at the register. But food came out quickly after we sat down, so maybe they move the line slowly on purpose. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars because the food was great. I had the corn and red pepper salad with salmon. HUGE fresh salad with a good sized portion of tasty salmon for just a few dollars. I also recommend you order a side of baguette because that baguette is amazing. It's served with butter and raspberry jam! Good value, cute environment, delicious food."}
{"text":"Best French pastries outside of Paris itself!

Highly recommend the turnovers and croissants. YUM."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed!!!!! This bakery blew me away! The food was excellent, service was great but the atmosphere was AMAZING!!!! 3 levels of seating. The decor was chaotically pleasing to the eye. I could visit this place everyday for a month and still find new decor. The atmosphere was delightful and I stayed for hours after my meal. I fell in love!!!"}
{"text":"What a joy to have a location closer to my mom's house! I don't live in town but am a long time Amelie's fan. I no longer have to drive 35-40 minutes to get my beloved twice-baked almond croissant. Although, as the other reviewers pointed out, the staff could use some customer service training. They seem annoyed at their job and the customers. However this will not deter me from returning."}
{"text":"Lovely service, not a bad wait time, clean area, great ambiance, lovely setup and good location in NoDa. The food and desserts and drinks are always delicious, however the drinks are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The food is great. 

The line is awful. 

I am currently in my second half hour waiting for a turkey and bacon croissant. I have finished my coffee and all the pastries that we got from the counter and still not gotten my warmed sandwich from the back. 

This would be a great place if it wasn't so crowded and the service wasn't so slow."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome - the food smells incredible - this whole little area is amazing - they are open 24 hrs?! That's just awesome! I'm so happy to have discovered this place and the surrounding area - it's located in a little mini mall type thing - really artsy and cool."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and cakes ... A refreshing experience ... :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for Lunch while in Charlotte. Enjoyed soup and a sandwich. Both had great flavor. Everything was fresh and savory. Would definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fun atmospshere, delicious food. The macarons are awesome and allergy friendly!"}
{"text":"A little piece of French Awesome in the South (BTW - I usually never use those two words in a sentence together). The best soup in the city and a great place to hang with friends or go read a book alone. 

Oui Oui is all I can say!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here has been amazing. Overpriced? Yes. Overcrowded? You betcha. But I still keep coming back every time I'm in Charlotte. The decorations inside are gorgeous and I love the atmosphere. There's almost always a long line that snakes its way into the seating area, but it moves pretty fast and it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"An eclectic yet comfortable place for a great cup of coffee and delicious pastries. I've been to two of the locations and both were great!"}
{"text":"First off, who doesn't love a good French Bakery?  If you don't, we can't be friends.  I fell in love with fruit tarts, macaroons, baguettes, crepes, and croissants when I first visited Paris at 19.  Amelie does all of those things justice.  I'm ashamed to say I've tried all of those items in only two trips to Amelie's when I was in town visiting friends (Who needs to fit into a wedding dress anyhow?).  However, we are moving to Charlotte and I can't wait for this bakery to become a staple of my sometimes very terrible diet.  They have plenty of places to sit, a beautiful display case, good drinks and sandwiches and plenty of places to park.  Charlotte needs more places like Amelie's."}
{"text":"Okay, hands down the best place in Charlotte. 

This place is so awesome, usually pretty busy but the wait isn't too long, and if it is, it's worth it.  Get your food and hope to find a table, don't worry one will turn up. 

The decor is borderline cute and over the top but nonetheless fun to look at.

They have pastries galore!! Everything from croissants, to macaroons to cream puffs, all delicious. They also have soups and sandwiches, everything you need to spend hours working, studying or just hanging out with friends. I wish I lived closer, I would be there errday!  

If you have not visited it yet you are missing it, so hurry and check it out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fabulous and so are the pastries!  A definite must visit! The sated caramel brownie is amazing! The coffee is great too. Nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"I have always specifically came to Amelie's for dessert but I was forced to come for lunch. I wasn't too excited about it since I was not aware they served lunch but I decided it would be worth it if I could also get a macaroon. The menu is limited to about 6 sandwiches and usually 2 soups of the day. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, no side. The soup was not appealing to me and I'm not a potato salad fan at all. The croissant was a decent a size and it was filled with a decent amount of chicken salad. The chicken in the chicken salad was big cubes of chicken but the whole thing was very flavorful and on the sweeter side. The croissant was buttery but was a little too flakey for my liking. I ended up eating with a fork because it became a mess. But overall I like the sand which I just wish there were more options for sides like baked chips or fresh fruit. Dessert never disappoints and the new location is great."}
{"text":"This is simply the best french bakery I've ever had. I am convinced it may be the absolute best in America.  I went to Charlotte for work about two years ago, and someone recommended it to me as a great place for a sweet tooth.  Added bonus: it's also 24 hours!  When I got there at 2:45 am, there was a line going from the counter, around the corner, into another room, along another hall and almost to the restroom in the very back of the building.  20 minutes later, I understood why.  It was magnificent!  The pastries were so light and fluffy, just sweet enough to satisfy, but not so sweet that it unpleasant.  Last year, my fiancee and I were driving back to Pittsburgh from the Florida Keys and a bad accident took us off track, so I convinced my fiancee to take a 20 minute detour to Amelies for pastries for our friends who were dog sitting for us while we were out of town.  We were the heros when we got home to our friends.  Now Amelies is an all time favorite of ours.  It's just...well, it's worth the detour."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! We LOVE this bakery and also the one uptown, which is huge! Eclairs and macaroons are our fav!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent here. Very friendly staff and didn't have to wait too long for my food and drink. I tried a seasonal drink this time which is worthy of raving about. It's called a Russian Tea. It is steamed orange juice with cinnamon clove simple syrup and topped with cinnamon. Though it's not really tea, it tastes wonderful and better than I imagined."}
{"text":"From the pastries to the food, it's all delicious. Try the Asparagus Leek Soup, I'm not a soup person but this stuff is awesome. Only complaint is that the line get confusing because some are there for pastries only + food and some people only want food, the line gets weird because of the setup with the registers next to the pastry display. I was here yesterday and many people were getting frustrated waiting in the long line only to realize they were in the pastry line. This is especially confusing when it's busy, which Amelie's tends to be since it's so yummy! Service is ALWAYS great, everyone always willing to help you with your choices since there's so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful bakery/coffee shop with a comfortable  vibe. The pastries are excellent - especially their flaky croissants and their sublime pecan rolls. Friendly staff , plenty of parking - this place is terrific."}
{"text":"Exceptional savory and dessert selections. Absolutely the worst ordering sequence on the planet. Yes I still come once a month with my spouse but always get frustrated when it comes to ordering.

Would be 5 stars if they could think a little and solve this. It's simple folks!"}
{"text":"I have only visited the Amelie's NoDa location and this location in Pineville. Between the two I much rather visit the NoDa location. Even though they selection of food and coffee is pretty much the same, the atmosphere in Pineville feels more like a warehouse with lots of chairs set up. The Ambiance is not as  homie, warm, or comfortable as the NoDa location. I still may visit this location on occasion, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"That I would NEED a hot beverage in the South at 2pm in the middle of April is unacceptable. 

A sunny yet frigid day ushered me into Amelie's Uptown.

First impression: Huge. 

The lighting & chandeliers (cue Sia and that creepy little dancer) still managed to convey a sense of intimacy. Found a corner with a view of the kitchen and sipped my beverage watching all the pastry making unfold. The staff joyfully baked and prepped, laughing and joking with each other. They appeared so engaged and delighted in their work! Though I couldn't hear them, for some reason, \"bibbitty bobbitty boo\" played in my head.

I skipped ordering a pastry, while the nice young woman at the counter kept insisting I try one of the many varieties of macarons. I declined, and on another note, they seem to be the darling dessert of the moment. All of a sudden, they're everywhere! They're okay, but I don't get it. What's so great about macarons?"}
{"text":"The layout is different when you walk inside, so much to see and get excited over! The staff was super friendly, the macaroons were delicious & so was the coffee! Going back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Who knew there were hipsters in the south? My favorite part of Amelie's is the decor; with all the  vintage/industrial furniture and dark woods, it's someplace I could spend a few hours studying, sipping coffee, and eating pastries.

In my opinion, Amelie's best baked goods are the croissant (and any variation of) and baguette. The blueberry and apple tart were disappointing, too sour and the crust didn't have much flavor at all. 

I'll be back to try some of the other goods, but for now I give Amelie's a 'Meh'."}
{"text":"Coffee A+
Sandwiches A+
Pastries F-
This is supposed to be a bakery so why do you put your cakes and tarts in a refrigerated case that drys them out! Seriously, I've been to bakeries that have been around for 50 years and they make their pastries fresh each morning and by the afternoon are sold out without ever needing a refrigerator. Just put them in a glass case like every other bakery! No need for a refrigerator to dry them out. Urghhhh I want to like you guys so much!"}
{"text":"Light atmosphere.
REALLY GREAT for interaction and conversation, and reading."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate here on a Beautiful Sunday. My daughter told me how good everything is here, so we gave it a try. I had the roast beef on a baguette with horseradish and cheese. I also had the asparagus leek soup. Both were awesome. My wife had the turkey and bacon on a croissant. So good. Of course we had to take home some french pastries. Great food, the price is right,AND it's less than 2 miles from our house. We will be back and often."}
{"text":"The salted caramel brownie is good.  Everything else was good as well, and I love that it is always open.  However, there is often a long line, so if you are impatient, just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Quirky and adorable place, with a beautiful display of baked goods.  Every baked item I've tried has been good, especially the salted caramel brownie and fruit tarts.

Breakfast sandwiches were also great, although they ran out of croissants.  I would love to try one on a croissant.

Coffee was good as well.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enormous bakery. Plenty of places to sit, but watch out. This place can get CROWDED. Just as my party of 8 got in line and ordered, a group of THIRTY TEENAGERS swarmed inside. You could see the faces of the people behind the counter fall, well, except for the one guy whose shift was about to end. He was relieved.

I got an eclair and DEAR GOD IT WAS DECADENT. I also took home a croissant with me and had it the next morning. A little stale, but it was still very fine. Very fine indeed.

There is about every French pastry in the book here. What a gem. Find out when the off-hours are and visit at those times because I have seen this place as a madhouse."}
{"text":"My review is minus a few stars based on service. Stopped in for a treat in a Friday evening. Typical line of 10-12 people which isn't anything I didn't expect. One very polite guy taking orders and packing up treats in the appropriate size box. One cashier trying to work fast but was simple overwhelmed by the constant flow of people. One guy stocking the case with more tasty treats. Heard him say \"make sure you tell people these are still frozen\". Wait? What?  Seemed like an odd thing for me to hear but I am sure with the volume they do, making ahead isn't far from what probably happens. Not a huge deal just caught me off guard. The treats I got were great which were a salted caramel brownie and mini key lime tart. I really felt another person or two working would have made my visit 5 stars."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughter's birthday, be sure to ask for your birthday eclair. Everyone we interacted with was so super nice which was nice bc it was our first visit. The food was AMAZING.  I had the Lavender soda and my daughter had the creme brulee soda and both were fantastic. Of course the eclair, macaroons, and fruit tart was delicious. The atmosphere was so cozy and eclectic. We just sat in our comfy chairs and hung out till our show started."}
{"text":"Love Amelie's.. and I know it sounds cliche b/c everyone probably says it, but I do. 

Beautiful atmosphere, great pastries (sweet tooth lovers down fall), open kitchen concept is nice as it's awesome to see the chefs and bakers make magic and the energy is always on point here. 

One caveat.....the bar tends to be slow on the trigger pull to take your order, so if your impatient, go to the line, but since I am a \"sit at the bar girl\" I just make sure they see me...couple winks, a little eye contact, a \"friendly\" DC \"yo!\". LOL.  So real talk, I dock a star for the lack of attention the bartenders give as they are more focused on being baristas than anything but still, I observe pretty antsy people. But when you have them, they are personable and friendly.

Turkey Bacon Croissant - get the full sandwich, you'll be pissed if you eat a half because it's sooo dog gone good. 

Chai creme latte - awesome, and they serve almond milk for us that can't tolerate a cow. 

Explore the menu of wines and beers if you have time. 

I always go when I need to read or do homework but want to be in the mix of good energy. 

Parking - no recommendations, I live in Uptown so I don't dare jump in my car to come here."}
{"text":"I tell you what. It was a real treat discovering this place.
I come from a Bakery family and this place reminds me of back home.
It's very hard to find locations like this!
I'd have to say the Tart selection is my favorite (pecan especially).
I will soon start stopping for a breakfast sandwich b/c I heard those were good too.
Its amazing how long they're open and how people are there at all times of the night."}
{"text":"Baked goods are good considering other bakeries available in the area. I wouldn't say it's great, but definitely worth a stop if you're nearby since they are open 24 hours daily. Sandwiches are tasty but somewhat smallish. The salted caramel brownie is a favorite and baguettes are perfect. 

Ambiance & Atmosphere: kitschy bordering on trying too hard, noisy, & the layout leaves the ordering line blocking the display cases so it can be difficult to have time to shop the offerings when the counter help is asking for your order right when you first see the contents du jour.

I'll be back when nearby but doubt I'd make a special trip to Amelie's."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.

I was in Charlotte for an overnight business trip and had found rave reviews about this place before going... I ended up going because they were open late (this location is open 24 hours!). Upon walking in around 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday night, I was surprised to see a line about 20 people long. Luckily, it went very quickly. Great staff, very helpful.

I had a blueberry lemonade, which was incredible... along with some chocolate/cinnamon macarons and the famous salted caramel brownie. It was the perfect sweet treat for a late night. They offer lots of sandwiches and soups as well, but I had already had dinner... I can't recommend this place enough!!

Moral of the story, if you walk in and see a line out the door--just wait it out. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken salad sandwich, random macaroons, tea cake and salted caramel brownie. Sandwich was mediocre, as expected though since it seems like sandwiches aren't the reason people show up here. The macaroons were good, hold the cinnamon chocolate one though, it was trash. Mixed berry, pistachio and whatever the purple was were very good. GF had the brownie and cake since they were Gluten-Free. She didn't die so I guess they were good. Would come back again if I was in the area or drunk. I can understand why this place would be popular at night. Missing a star for rushed ordering if you don't know the menu. Put out some menus I can read while in line."}
{"text":"So my review is strictly on the place and the service as I didn't eat anything. First time in N.C. and our friends said we HAD to come here. I was SO full I could only drool at the goodies behind the counter. But the place itself is amazing. Everything about it was inviting and fun. I loved the Mona Lisa wearing sunglasses, there was plenty of room for seating and they have event rooms. And by all accounts (the way my husband and friends devoured their desserts) the food was great. The place was packed. As we walked I was surprised to see the line wrapped from the front to the back. I was thinking it would take forever. Nope - the staff was awesome! They had the line moving very quickly and were very friendly. Next time we're in town I'll remember to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"French pastries - YES! I've tried numerous pastries at Amelie's and my favorites must be their macarons. By god the seasonal pumpkin macaron is like tasting everything there is to love about the fall season in a few small bites. Just wonderful. I love to bring out-of-towners here after dinner to pick up goodies to take back to the house for later. One of my favorite things about Charlotte for sure."}
{"text":"Walked into the bakery and the first thing I noticed were the decor. I loved the chalkboard menu with the gold frames and all the artsy French decor. And then the smell of caramel! I'd really didn't want to leave.

The girl behind the counter who helped me was so friendly and made me feel very comfortable. He told me her favorites and explained each dessert I had questions for. So yes, service was amazing.

I really wanted to get one of everything but I ended up getting one of each flavor in the French macaron which were jalapeño, mixed berry, orange, lemon, dark chocolate, raspberry, pistachio, & rose water and then a salted caramel brownie. The macarons were amazing! The macaron shells were perfect. So tall, pretty large, colors so vibrant, smooth shells, no air pockets, and filling weren't too sweet. The jalapeño one was super weird because I could definitely taste the jalapeño but the heat didn't come. It didn't taste bad, just weird to me but I'm glad I got to try something so different. The brownie was AMAZING!!!

I don't care if I live almost 3 hours away, this place is worth the drive to come back again and again.

P.S. They offer military discount! I wish I could add another star"}
{"text":"It's rare to come across a true French bakery in NC. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with the variety and several sweets I tried at this Amelie bakery recently. Everything was on point from the macaroons to the salt caramel brownies to the iced lattes I am sorry I mean \"grand creme.\" Now the decor here is like something out of Alice in Wonderland-seriously stairs here and there. Chandeliers made of French horns and trumps and mirrors embedded in live bushes. It's fun and playful. So enjoy your sweets and don't be startled if the mad hatter joins you for some tea and macaroons :)"}
{"text":"Salad game is strong here.   Mixed greens w pecans bacon onions and chicken was top shelf.   Daughter says choc mousse cupcake is very good."}
{"text":"Great place! I've only been once, but definitely plan on going back. Even at 2 o'clock in the morning Amelie's had a line out the front door. This is a tell-tell sign that a place is worth the wait. I'm not a huge coffee drinker so I ordered a hot chocolate and a chocolate croissant. 2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"The pastries that I've gotten have been ok. The atmosphere is neat, but I really don't see what the hype is about. Maybe I just haven't ordered the right items but the desserts haven't been \"out of this world wonderful\" like everyone claims they are."}
{"text":"The better of the two locations, they have everything you want from a coffee shop; eccentric atmosphere promoting productivity, wide range of caffeinated and non caffeinated beverages, pastries, it's French, and macaroons. A staple of the town that you simply must take any visitor."}
{"text":"This is the de-facto hipster place to go in Charlotte. If paying an arm and leg for pastries that cost next to nothing to make is your idea of cool, you will fit in here. The pastries taste good, but they are nothing special and not worth the price. This is not a \"must visit\" foody destination in Charlotte, and you are certainly paying a premium for its popularity. I would be willing to bet that 90% of Amélie's fans have never baked before. Avoid."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this café! We got here early for a bite to eat in the morning. They have tons of pastry items to chose from. I got their seasonal pastry which was spinach and feta cheese on a croissant like bread. It was delicious! My husband got a breakfast sandwich with spinach, portobello mushroom, and mozzarella cheese. It was also good. I got a lavender latte which has just the right amount of sweetness. My husband got a Honduras coffee.. made in a French press. They do not do pour overs here. They carry coffee beans roasted by First Impressions.  
This place is open 24/7, has free wifi and lots of seating. It's probably the go-to place for students doing late night studying. Everything here has a French touch or reference to Paris. 
Great place to visit if you're traveling and want to grab something to eat. Staff was nice and the restaurant was very clean!"}
{"text":"All I can say is yummy, this some of the best creame puffs, and my dad had well I forgot but it was a yummmy friendly atomoshere"}
{"text":"I'm a huge coffee shop explorer and this is one of my all time favorites! Big, creatively decorated, tons of fun drink specials and menu options. Everyone is friendly and efficient. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"OK, this is my first visit here and to be honest I was not really impressed. First the area around the bakery is a scary area of town. it is absolutely horrible with train tracks and worn down buildings and homes. I have been told that NODA is a hipster central but I really do not see it that way. it is not swanky at all and its pretty close to central avenue in appearance.

As far as the bakery goes we had Chesse croissonts, apple turnovers and regular croissants and it was just OK. There was nothing out of the ordinary with regards to the food we ordered. we had a major problem with the lady at the counter as she was giving our order just cold and when I asked her \" Are you not going to warm it for us\" she retorted \"Oh you want this warmed up\" as if a cold Croissaont tastes so much better than a warm one.. Duh..

Also all our food was served by the server in 1 plate when the order taker knew it was for two and a second empty plate had to be requested..

The seating here is also limited and it feels very congested as one of the tables next to the ordering counter are in the way of people standing in line to order their food.

Overall not a pleasant expereince from all the congestion, lack of good service from the questions etc and we were not at all impressed..

Since we live in the North side of town we would certainly not return to this worn down area of town to eat in this not so impressive bakery.."}
{"text":"I was ready to give this place a raving 5 star review before I even ordered a drink!  Only a week ago I was bemoaning the dearth of true cafe's in Charlotte.  There are a few cool ones here and there, but none of them seem to be open past even 9pm!  24 hours is superb!  (already used up my lifetime quota of 3 exclamation points and I don't care!)

I had just eaten when I arrived, so I didn't sample any of the delectable desserts, but they all looked superb.  The price for a coffee was totally reasonable and comes with one free refill.  All the creamers and condiments you could desire are there for you as well.  I had a \"sipping chocolate\" which was quite good and satisfied my multi-year cravings for a (evil) Starbucks Chantico which they discontinued (eviler).

There is plenty of seating, which is crucial since the place is pretty busy.  The design is very eclectic - you'll see if you haven't been there before.  I'm really excited to have found this place and will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a French bakery with great reviews that is open 24/7.  The one place that is open at all hours.  I love the pastries and the coffee that they serve.  I actually got chocolate croissants to go and sat in to eat a chocolate mousse cup and a slice of their cakes.  It was sweet and goes well with the latte that I was having.  It was a crowded place, very limited in seats because they are all occupied.  Its quite a small place and sometimes the line went to near the bathroom area, and it was only 10pm.  Next time I would try a later time hopefully there would be more seating."}
{"text":"This is a North Carolina staple. A very cute and eccentric cafe that's open 24/7. I was surprised to hear their hours but apparently it's the best spot to come after a good night of going out! 

I'm pretty obsessed the vibe. It's like a randomly collection of French art, and crazy chandeliers and couches. 

While there I got chocolate mousse (no egg or gelatin). It is very massive and definitely not a one person thing to handle!! I would recommend the mini cup instead for one person."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, Bill Cosby was one of America's Respected Men, believe it or not.  And from the high perch of Saturday morning television, he often pontificated to the country's youth on how breakfast was the \"most important meal of the day.\"  

For too many years, I took \"most important\" to mean \"very large.\"  That led to many unconfortable weekend days saddled with the results of Shoney's Breakfast Bar or some other horrible, oversized breakfast, sometimes administered in an effort to cure a hangover (but almost always exacerbating it).

Having learned the error of my ways, I still think of breakfast as very important, but it's also important to keep it light.  A place like Amelie's French Bakery is perfect for that.  It has reasonably-sized, reasonably-priced egg sandwiches served on surprisingly decent baguettes, accompanied by very good coffee.  There are plenty of great-looking pastries as well, although I didn't try those.

You get to enjoy this fare in a dining area that looks like an undergrad's fantasy of classical French sophistication.  I mean that in a good way:  It's got a shabby-chic and comfortable appeal to it.  Impressively, Amelie's is open 24 hours a day, and I suspect that the surroundings would seem a bit surreal if you came here after a bender in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"had the apple pomme, pistachio petit four, and chocolate bread pudding. this place was raved about, and I didn't see the need for all of the excitement around it from what I tried. Having said that, they were sweet treats, the staff was nice, and there was a cool ambiance. if I was a college student, I would appreciate this being around (especially given its hours)."}
{"text":"Typically a fan of Amielie's but today was not that day. My sandwich, seeded roast beef on a baguette was delicious however the side - a white truffle thyme bean salad was mostly red onion and cream, way too creamy. I tasted no thyme or truffle.  Will still alway be a customer"}
{"text":"Went for the first time here on a rainy night and surprisingly it was full. I fell in love this place the moment I entered, loved the decor and the over all vibe. The chocolate croissant was to die for and so was the fruit tart. My new favorite coffee place in the queen city"}
{"text":"Looks great and smells awesome. everything was so quaint from the size of the pastries and chocolates to the french eclectic decor.
I was very statisfied for breakfast and coffee"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!!!! The most creative, tasty food, pastries and drinks. I will ALWAYS support Amélie's"}
{"text":"I would say this place is not as great as it is popular. The pastries are not all that good and the place is so busy it's not the cleanest. I had the salted layered latte and would say it was good but not great."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is much better than their original location on Davidson. First off, SO MANY SEATS. At the location on Davidson, finding a seat is near impossible. But here, the location is a sea of chairs, sofas, and tables. Also, there are two  bathrooms, so no lines. Besides that, the pastries and ambience are identical to that of the original location."}
{"text":"Mostly overrated and overpriced unfortunately.  I really like the atmosphere here though.  This was my second time visiting as I never get get time to go during the week because of work but I was not feeling well and took the day off and decided to grab a quick breakfast.  I only got a latte and pain au chocolate (twice baked).  The Croissant was pretty good but I would love to try their other options.  The latte was good, but not the best I have had in Charlotte.  Overall I give this place 3 stars and not 4 because it is simply overpriced.  However, because the atmosphere here reminds so much of being back in France, I like it enough to return occasionally.  It has so many decorations and French paintings that it puts me back in the mindset."}
{"text":"Best place for dessert in charlotte! A little pricey for some items but not bad for the city."}
{"text":"The best bakery. Open 24/7. Amazing food. Always long lines but so worth the wait. We have been about 5 times and other than the occasional rude employee (which is rare) we have had exceptional service and never regretted our food choices. They make their own lavender lemonade that is really refreshing! One tip: There is a ton of seating in the very back if you walk down the hall past the coffee bar. My favorites include the salted caramel torte, macaroons if they are fresh, and bacon and cheese on a croissant."}
{"text":"Having been in Charlotte for a while, I suppose it's time I left a review for one of its more storied establishments. 

Amelie's is an eclectic bakery that is essentially a kitchen in the midst of a cobbled-together strip mall hideaway. The seating is a tad on the cramped side, but that's mainly due to the place's unflinchingly large crowd. Don't arrive super hungry after 9pm most nights. The decor is what draws the eclectic descriptor for the place. It's weird, but it works.

The coffee is pretty good, but the seasonal iced teas are a real draw. That and the multiple cases of French-inspired sugary goodness. It doesn't want for desserts. The place stays busy because it has the French café goodies to satisfy any sweet tooth.

It's also a great, neutral place to meet people. I see a lot of first dates there - and actually met my wife there for the first time. We also catered our in-lieu-of-cake wedding desserts from here, meaning the NoDa location. I have not yet visited the new Uptown location.

All in all, there is a lot to like at Amelie's, from atmosphere and people-watching to the actual food and drink on-hand. It's a bit crowded at times with quite a din, but it's also comfortable in its own skin. I recommend it when you have the time and the need to satisfy a craving. Or just whenever you feel like getting a treat."}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Charlotte for a sweet treat! I always love their fresh fruit tarts and chai tea. Their macaroons are also delicious and on point with their flavors. I love the environment and the unique decorations at the bakery. Overall, a great place to chill with friends, study or go on a date!"}
{"text":"What a cute and pricey spot. Know what you want so you don't get to the register with $21 worth of stuff. Everyone was like this and that is good so I wanted it all lol. It was extremely clean both inside and outside. I ordered leak/asparagus soup which was ok it needed a little salt. The macaroons and key lime tarts were delicious. My hubby ordered a sticky bun but I never heard if he liked it."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find!  A hidden gem on the back side of a pretty cool strip mall (yes, I DID just use those words in the same sentence).  This place is enormous, and it was packed mid-day mid-week.  There was even a video blogger doing some filming inside while I was there.  The patrons were young and old, including what appeared to be a group of about 12 having a business meeting in one area.  The vibe is cool, chic French, with lots of eclectic seating and decor.  The music is fitting but not obtrusive.  The pastry case is huge, and the simple chocolate croissant and latte I had were perfect.  My only wish is that they had more outdoor seating, and that is was shaded.  On a sunny day, this is the only thing they don't offer much of.  But, the inside...c'est vraiment magnifique!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a wonderful coffee shop for late-nights or early mornings. The best thing about Amelie's is that it is open 24/7...not many Charlotte establishments can boast that!

Amelie's is unapologetically kitschy, with French accoutrement covering the walls, tables and menu. The decor can only be explained as \"what an American imagines a Parisian coffeehouse to be,\" although any French person would die laughing if they came inside. But Amelie's recognizes its frivolity,  even relishes in it, with tongue-in-cheek art and silly t-shirts.

Amelie's prétention a la célébrité are the incredibly gorgeous pastries prepared daily. Cakes, tarts, honey buns, turnovers, brownies, macarons, eclairs, the list goes on and on. They even offer gluten-free and some dairy-free options, but do not offer any vegan pastries (super depressing to this girl). You can order individual portions or full-size pastries for an event. 

In addition to pastries Amelie's offers a menu of sandwiches, salads and drinks that updates seasonally. A personal favorite is the mushrooms duexelles tartine, a fabulous garlicky mushroom pate (almost) spread over the most wonderful crispy baguette. Usually served with cheese (for non-vegans) as an open-faced sandwich.

Amelie's is a great place to take friends and family when they come visit you in Charlotte. It's cute and fun, with plenty of conversation starters, and open 24/7/365. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of those places you go when you want to get some blogging done. The setting is quite unique and the crowd is diverse. The pastries are super delicious though I shy away from crabs now a days."}
{"text":"Open late. Amelie's French Bakery was hopping at 10pm on a Wednesday. I was told they're open 24 hours. The coffee was fabulous. I don't usually expect much from a bakery, where the focus usually is focused on their baked goods, but the coffee was noteworthy. 
The second thing I appreciated was the eclectic decor. Not just funky like some coffee shops, but interesting and odd while attractive & clean. There are multiple rooms, so plenty of seating. I saw a group playing a board game. 
The selection of baked goods was beautiful and tempting. I tried the vanilla cake with buttercream, my friend had the cake with pistachio buttercream (that was pretty incredible). They also had a selection of macarons, financiers, croissant and so forth. Great place to end the night."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars because we went in 1 minute to closing and they took our order with smiles, and people kept coming until we left and they took those people too well after closing! The general manager Vicky approached us and asked how everything was. I ordered a chai latte which was delicious, and an eclair which was amazing! Everyone was working hard, and I know this location is new and everyone was still getting into the groove of everything but I really don't have a bad thing to say about this location! Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Lovely interior
Yummy coffee
Pretty desserts
Yummy EVERYTHING

Come here to relax or with a purpose to indulge on the sweets or treats. This is a staple in Charlotte. Plus being open 24/7 is the best!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, I absolutely love the eclectic French atmosphere.  Most of the time however the wait is quite long but it's definitely manageable.  Amelie's is one of my favorite go-to's."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! It was my first time ever coming but the atmosphere was very cute and quaint! I will definitely be coming back here in the near future!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about my visit to Amelie's was the line! Luckily though they worked through it pretty quickly. A lot of people mention the seating but, when I was there on a Friday night it was getting pretty aggressive with people trying to secure a spot.

The pastries were great, and well I eat a lot of pastries so I like to consider myself a semi-expert. Luckily just as we were about to close up our box they put out a new tray of macarons one of the trays held a cinnamon chocolate one that I immediately snatched up and it was delicious. Some of the other highlights were the salted caramel brownie, pistachio macaron, and this raspberry cake square.  

I do agree with others that the service isn't exactly something to rave about here. But, it didn't really bother me. I wanted the line to move fast and to get the pastries I wanted and the service did enable that for me."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Amelie's.  Always a great place to grab coffee, a nice lunch or late night dessert."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out and do work! There many rooms and seating areas, so finding a cozy spot was no problem. I ordered their asparagus and spinach soup, which was delicious. However, I wish they posted their soup prices because I was a bit shocked that a small cup costed $4. Other then that, I had an enjoyable time at Amelie's."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with awesome pastries and coffee! My boyfriend and I were visiting Charlotte when we found this gem. We will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good wine selection, lovely atmosphere, but poor service. I waited at the bar for ten minutes and had to flag down a bartender. Order your wine as you order your food and you can save yourself some time."}
{"text":"Another popular edition to the growing backlot of Park Road Shopping Center, Amelie's biggest location gets a strong start! We stopped in around 9am on opening Saturday to enjoy some breakfast and experienced a fast-moving line and plenty of smiles. 

You know the drill: salted caramel brownies, mouth-watering flaky croissants, and traditional cafe drinks. This visit I enjoyed a raspberry streusel muffin and we got back in line to grab three more croissants to save us a trip for the next morning. 

The funky decor permeates throughout three different seating areas, including a large main floor, some elevated seating on the right when you walk in, and a large patio that will certainly get more use once the dog days of summer depart. 

I'm glad I tried the lavender + honey soda, as it was a refreshing way to start the day. This Charlotte staple is now more easily accessible for the Myers Park crowd and certainly will stay busy, so I wonder how much the nearby Caribou Coffee will take a hit in business? With Dot Dot Dot speakeasy-style bar and Midwood Smokehouse BBQ, you could spend a whole day eating and drinking around the backlot of Park Road Shopping Center!"}
{"text":"Prior to arrival, I was looking up places to visit in Uptown, Charlotte on yelp. Amelie's immediately caught my eye. Not only do I have a huge sweet tooth, but I'm also a fan of eclectic decorations. The shop was everything I thought it would be. The shop was nice and spacious with a decent amount of seating. I liked how when I approached the glass counter, I didn't feel pressure to buy anything right away. There was just too many desserts to look at (and I am usually a very indecisive person). The workers at the shop were very friendly"}
{"text":"Pretty good, good hours....I like this place for when im craving that midnight snack or need my morning coffee... The coffee taste like a desert depending on kind u get....love this place!!"}
{"text":"Very very eclectic bakery and coffee shop. Yep it's very really cool the location is perfect food is good and well-made. The desserts are definitely traditional bakery so you won't find the American cupcakes and traditional cookies. These are the \"fancy\" bakery items"}
{"text":"The best bakery I've been to this side of the U.S.. I loved everything I've tried and I will always come back to try more. I really wish I lived closer but then again I don't think it would be to good for me."}
{"text":"Great place for family, friends and everyone in between. Definitely romantic. Has a great view of the city. The eclectic atmosphere is inviting and friendly. Went with my boyfriend an his daughter. We got two tarts, a palmier and a pastry. All AMAZING!"}
{"text":"There seems to be something missing. 

I was really excited about Amelies coming to South Charlotte. I am in a long, drawn out love affair with their salted caramel brownies - like everyone else in charlotte. 

The food is ok. I'm currently crunching on a turkey and brie sandwich... but it's just ok. Even the caramel brownie isn't out of this world like I have experienced at the other location. Just something off.

This location is more open and easier to navigate. There's a place for a line to form, plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio where the Love Locks live. It's all nice, but there's nothing fancy or \"hidden gem\" about this place. This isnt the quiet study spot that i expected it to be, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to NoDa? The staff doesn't help much either. I've been here 3 or 4 times and every time I feel like I'm not hip enough - and Lord knows, it could just be me. Haha. When I order at the counter, I feel like I'm interrupting something, or not doing it right. There's not a whole lot of explanation - more \"what do you want?\". Nah mean?

So, I'll continue eating my sandwich and floating on their wifi. I'm not in love with this location like I thought I would be. I think if I didn't know what to expect, and had never heard of Amelie's, it might bring in another star - but only for the unique decorating. 

It's fine, and I'll come here again for coffee... *womp womp*"}
{"text":"I think I may be the only person in Charlotte that does not like this place. The ambiance is great, but the baked goods are pretty terrible. It tastes like the pre-packaged stuff you can buy at Starbucks."}
{"text":"Yes I love this place.(the original). The only thing I don't like is the long wait and long lines and the fact that they don't appear to try to improve that. They need more people behind the counter, moving that line along! To me, it is not acceptable to NOT try."}
{"text":"I came here one late afternoon, and it was pretty busy still! I just came to get a couple little mousse cups (my favorite). They had a Bailey's flavored - so I had to try it, and I got two chocolate ones. I also got a small mixed berry fruit tart. 
Everything was amazing - as usual - and I need more of the mousse cups in my life!! 
This was my first time at this specific location (I usually went to the NoDa one), but this one had a very large area that connected to another large lower floor."}
{"text":"Ran in to get a little snack and ended up with 2 palmiers and a mini mixed berry tart.  The young man who helped me was friendly even though the 2 guys in front of me had trouble deciding what they wanted.  They took forever!  

I love a good palmier.  Theirs was good and buttery.  The mini tart was also enjoyable.  Just the perfect size for a snack.  I'd like to try a meal there next time.  Cute place."}
{"text":"I really feel like I'm in Paris when I go here. The decor is perfect. It has a very relaxing atmosphere. I had the mixed berry, raspberry , and saffron lemon macaroon and I about passed out from how fresh it was. Like so yum. There is a corner bar in the back for wine and or espresso .. they are carrying summer specials right now that look wonderful. It smells amazing in there and the staff is super knowledgeable. Will be back"}
{"text":"You guys nailed it. 
I'm absolutely pierced in my heart with extravagant design and nice food. 24/7 cafe? Are you kidding me? This is it! 
What a welcoming, relaxing atmosphere!What a variety of little cute creative things  all over the place!!
I enjoyed everything!!! Keep on exploding in ideas and creative flow. I'll definitely be back and recommend you to my friends!"}
{"text":"Lemon raspberry cake was to die for! And very nicely arranged. Grabbed an eclair while I was there which was delicious, but they poke holes in the bottom in order to fill, so then it leaked out and makes a mess as you're eating. Still tasty, but that was a little odd I thought!! Will definitely be visiting Amelie's again!"}
{"text":"I love the overall theme of Amelie's! The Parisian cafe decor was adorable and I especially loved the mix matched tables and chairs. 
The pastries were delicious but I didn't like the ordering process. There was a long line and multiple cases of sweets. There was only one employee running between each of the cases to assist each patron. 
The prices were good and the iced coffee was the real gem of Amelie's. SO GOOD! I also loved that they had soy milk since so many places don't."}
{"text":"The food, desserts, decor, and vibe is by far the best in charlotte. Great place to get some work done and people watch.  Croque Monsieur accompanied with the spinach asparagus leeks soup is sure to melt your soul. Award winning desserts... you can't go wrong with your choice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great outpost of Amelie's on the backside of Park Road Shopping Center.  Of course the sweets are amazing, but don't overlook the savory delights in store here. The spinach, asparagus and leek soup is a brothy, flavorful and reliable menu standard. Grab a ham and cheese on perfectly fresh baked baguette and you'll think you are in Paris. Finish it with a French Macaron and you'll be in Heaven. 

They're new in this location and working out a few service and system kinks.  A very welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Dessert was amazing!! Can't go wrong with the salted caramel brownie. However, service is extremely slow, especially at the beverage bar. Waited almost 30 minutes for my coffee and it wasn't even that busy.  Will go back, but never ordering coffee again!"}
{"text":"This place rocks its a Artsy French Bakery with a cool laid back vibe. Its open 24 hours a day 7 days a week which makes this an awesome night spot to grab a great dessert or croissant. It also makes a really great place to study and great first date spot. One warning though if you are super hungry this is not the spot to go. The portions are small but on the other hand the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I would show up weekly just for the entertaining people-watching but the display case filled with delicious French pastries certainly helps!

This place is usually busy and bustling so, if you're a first-timer, it's preferable if you come with an 'old pro' so you won't hold up the line trying to decide on what to order.  

My personal favorites? The famed salted caramel brownie, chocolate and plain croissants, any of the fruit tarts, and the macarons. I've never tried any of the soups or the sandwiches but my friends have all raved about them. I would skip the house coffee - nothing special about it all.

Grab a seat in the atrium and enjoy the food/ambiance!"}
{"text":"I have had their products before, but this was my first visit. The best part was being answered by the staff in complete sentences with factual and responsive answers. The staff gets a *****.

The Financier I chose had a perfect texture. A. The only thing that kept it from A+ was the raspberry drizzle; good flavor but rubbery, stretchy feel. This is not an easy patissiere to present to the public in a coffee house aesthetic.

I chose a blueberry and cream cheese muffin. The batter was not too sweet and the topping was a good balance. The blueberries tasted great but there were too many in the muffin itself, ruining large sections by over-moist sections. A.

I asked for the fruit Danish and my server recommended the fresh strawberry instead which I instantly accepted. The pastry was spot-on, very impressive. The sliced strawberries had a lovely freshness which was accented and not over-powered by the glaze. The texture of the pastry was light and flaky and the edges had that satisfying crunch. A+

My happiest moment was when I asked my server, fully expecting a \"Duh\" response, if \"They had French Press.\" Almost nobody knows this, and I expected this reply. The reply I got was to show me two different sizes and to ask if I preferred dark or medium. Dark French Press Coffee from a staff who knows what they're doing. A+

If you don't mind carbohydrates, you must visit Amélie's. If you must watch carbs, then go as I did with others and taste the baked goods, giving the larger portions to the others."}
{"text":"Like always, this is the best place to go. Just being in the bakery makes you feel like a hipster. The atmosphere is artsy, victorian, and of course, french inspired. The food is pretty also, the decoration is exact, and elegant, it makes you feel like you are sitting outside of a bakery in France with a barrette on sipping coffee overlooking the sun set behind the glistening eiffel tower. The food is not only pretty, but it is great. The cakes are rich but not too sweet. The salted caramel brownie, salted but not to tart. Overall, amelies is as close as you can get to France without a plane or a boat. The smell of coffee and chocolate are soothing and relaxing, and the couches and chairs make you feel like royalty. While I admit the price is not the cheapest (2.50$-7.89$ for most of the single pastries) it is cheaper than airfare to France. This is the place to be."}
{"text":"First trip to the new Amelie's was for a lunch with a friend. As others have said, it is MASSIVE. I think I spent 15 minutes just looking around, trying to take everything in. We met at 11:45, and the place was already hopping, so we quickly got into one of the two lines for food (there's a separate one for pastries). Unfortunately, although one cashier was working our line, two cashiers were working the other line. It was really inefficient, and we had to wait forever to order.

I got the turkey and brie on a croissant instead of a baguette, and my friend got the turkey and bacon on a croissant. Both were tasty, but both of our croissants were cooked just a little too much and crumbled into a million pieces every time we bit into them. By the end, we were brushing crumbs out of each other's hair. 

However, we were able to grab a seat in front of the huge window where you can watch the chefs make all their pastries, so we got lunch and a show. We also saw a ton of movers and shakers, so this isn't the place to go for a quiet meal. As someone else mentioned, the wi fi was non-existent while we were there; I couldn't even execute a simple Google search on my phone. I love Amelie's, so hopefully this was a rare iffy experience... looking forward to giving it another go soon!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. If you have cravings for pastries at 3 am, this is your place. Open 24 hours with free WiFi and all the pastries and coffee you need."}
{"text":"Noda location almost always busy after 6pm and the weekends. love the croissants, blueberry muffin, and salted Carmel brownies. 
The downtown location is way bigger but challenging to find parking unless you use the decks. Same great food."}
{"text":"Since coming to Charlotte a few months ago to work on a project I've come to rely on Amelie's as my go to coffee, pastry and lunch spot when I want something fast, affordable and tasty.

It's a giant space and I don't know how they get by because I could only imagine the rent. However, this helps in making the place never seem crowded even when it is. In addition, the great customer service helps things move along when there are long lines.

I believe most people come for the pastries, which are delicious. I almost always grab at least one, even if I'm only here for lunch or dinner. I especially liked the double baked chocolate almond croissant. The only other place I've found it was at Jean Paul's in Laguna Beach or while traveling in France. They're also know for their sea salt brownies and the even have a sea salt mocha. 

To eat I almost always get the roast beef with manchego cheese on a croissant. Manchego is one of my favorite cheeses and you don't see if paired with a sandwich that often. The daily soups are also great and definitely taste homemade and not out of a can or frozen bag.

It's 5 stars for what it is. It's a great French bistro/cafe. It's not a high-end restaurant with snooty folks. It's a great neighborhood like spot that accommodates both locals and visitors alike and that's why I enjoy dropping in once a week."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a Charlotte staple and for good reasons. Not only are the dessert options amazing, but the food is amazing as well. I've never ordered anything I haven't liked. This was my second or third time visiting the Uptown location. It is a large space and keeps the same look and feel as the NoDa location. With eclectic art pieces like chandeliers, Mona Lisa and the iconic blue and white striped walls, it feels like you're getting a glimpse of France.  

On this trip, we were eating lunch. I got a blueberry and peach salad with a raspberry balsamic vinegrette, a cup of spinach, asparagus and leek soup and a chocolate coconut pecan bread pudding for dessert. The salad was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. The salad was harmoniously balanced with the sweetness of the fruit, the sour of the vinegrette and the saltiness of the blue cheese crumbles. To top it off, the croissant croutons were a special treat. The soup I've had before and it never disappoints. Each of their soups seem like they take the time to build a robust flavor. And the bread pudding was delicious. The bread used were their delicious buttery croissants. And they take about ten minutes to heat up, but when it comes out the chocolate is melted and it really is a special treat."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! I was in town visiting, and a friend took me by here, raving about the pastries. Not only were the pastries delicious, but their sandwiches were good too! I had the chicken salad on a croissant - the croissant was unbelievable. Wasn't stale, wasn't hard - it was just perfect. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on Saturday.  We arrived around 9:30-10ish and the display cases were so bare!  I wanted to get something yummy and decadent but ended up getting a breakfast sandwich.  Unfortunately, something was wrong with every one of four our orders; the bread was toasted and it wasn't supposed to be, the egg was scrambled and it was supposed to be over easy, etc....  I ordered one of the french sodas and the barista was yelling my name to pick it up while I was still trying to pay for my order.  I waved at her to acknowledge, but she grew obviously impatient. When I went over there, she had my order wrong! I will go back again but hope the service is better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops in Charlotte. The decor/ambiance is absolutely perfect. The food, suburb. I wasn't a big fan of lavender lemonade, it wasn't particularly lavender or lemony. The macroons were perfection, however."}
{"text":"I have an obsession with well-crafted baked confections.  On my visit to Charlottee my aim was to find a bakery that fills my caloric need of yumminess.  Amelie's did not quite fill my yummy meter, in the sweet side, but the savory side they did.

First, the atmosphere makes me want to give it 3.5 stars, but alas decor can only do so much when the baked goods are not up to snuff. But I did enjoy that they have different areas with different styles, and an atrium as well for louder groups.

So first of all. My goto caffeine kick is a nonfat latte. Amelie's does not have skim nor lowfat milk. They only have whole & soy milk, and cream. That was already my minus 5 for me. What place that prides themselves of nicely crafted expresso not have nonfat milk? really, je n'sais pas.

Anyway, so i pulled myself together because I was honestly in shock to hear this. I actually had to ask twice to make sure I heard her correctly. they have soy, so I had a soy latte. It was delicious, but still.

I ordered a egg breakfast croissant sandwich with spinach and asiago cheese. It was yummy. The croissant was perfectly crafted. Not too buttery, it was just amount of flaky. It was not chewy from it being underbaked. The spinach was nothing to speak about, not sure if it was fresh or not. but the egg was cooked well and it was paired nicely with my asiago cheese. Overall, I'd order it again no questions asked.

I got 2 items to go. A lemon tea cake and a mixed berry 'tart.' Though the overall tea cake was delicious. It had a nice crumb and beautiful in color and appearance-- it was not at all lemony. All I could really taste was butter. Lemon zest please? Lemon curd? Something? And this mixed berry tart was more muffin to me simply because of the overall texture of it. Tarts to me are dense and buttery. This mixed berry were neither of this things. It was fluffy and I could not even taste the berry. When I bit into it, it resembled a muffin.

Pricing wise, I found some of their items a bit overpriced. But again, that is because I was disappointed. I have no issue with paying more if it is delicious and what I expected. The lemon tea cake was probably the size of a slightly larger square golf ball and I think it was almost 2 dollars. Meh, not worth it. I think the tarts were $4 and size wise it was probably the circumference of a average grapefruit and height was probably a little more than 1/2 inch. Again, if it was yummy and tart like I could careless how much it cost. 

Would I go back to try other items? Absolutely. But I did leave wanting and expecting more."}
{"text":"I Love this place, the desserts are AMAZING! It is so hard to pick just one."}
{"text":"Went to visit my daughter last week in Charlotte...and she took me there. Oh my goodness, this little gem is Heaven on Earth. The customer service was amazing not to mention the pastries. Looking forward to my next visit to Charlotte, because I will be going there again for sure."}
{"text":"The croque monsiuer here are delicious! Even with the huge glops of mustard. But the lattes are wwwwwwaaayyy too sweet and I even overheard a customer sitting behind me that he couldn't finish his drink because it was too sweet. 
And the mosaic table will scratch the ish out of your phone :("}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Amelie's. The thing that sticks out to me most when I think about this place is quality. They truly put their passion behind their products to make the highest quality french pastries, cookies, pies and other confections. My favorite thing to do is to pop in and just buy one tiny treat for myself when I've hit a big goal or really need a little pick-me-up. Because the desserts are so well made, I know that every calorie is worth it. 

They also have coffee and tea and delicious made to order sandwiches and salads. As with the baked goods, these are also crafted with care with high quality ingredients. 

I have to stop writing this review now because just thinking about this place is making my mouth water and I don't want to drool all over my keyboard. So, don't take my word for it, go try Amelie's out for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have amazing hours and offer a very wide variety of food where anyone can find something that they like. This is a place that you have to stop when visiting Charlotte, as it is a true hidden gem in the city."}
{"text":"Oddly enough it's very funky place lost a star over the desserts. They were good but not great. However the sandwich we had was fantastic. Roast beef with mozzarella cheese and horseradish. Real horseradish, The kind of gets up in your sinuses and clears your head for you. Very unexpected on a sandwich at a place like this. The Decor is fun and funky, the coffee was very good too.

The desserts were certainly above the median but clearly not what I expected from a place that seems to market itself as French pastry shop."}
{"text":"Ooh la la! If you're a fan of delectable, decadent desserts, Amelie's will be your Parisian paradise in the Queen City. The chocolate truffles filled with different flavors of ganache are a must-try. The passionfruit is indescribably sweet, tart, and chocolate-y all at once. It is positively orgasmic. In addition to passionfruit, there is currant, raspberry, and chocolate ganache. All are a chocolate-lovers dream.

Their pastries are light, delicate, and fresh, and coffee is abundant. Other Yelpers have described Amelie's atmosphere- it certainly is a cheerful spot on the otherwise depressed edge of NoDa. No help, either, that there seems to be permanent road and construction work all around.

Never mind all that, when you visit Amelie's you have the sense you're in a Parisian patisserie, where the plaintive voice of Edith Piaf wraps you in a fur coat of luxury. Frugal escapists take heed: visit this little gem."}
{"text":"A good bakery, but, a little overrated in my opinion. More of a cult following than not, I believe."}
{"text":"I tried their salted caramel French soda and the spinach leek soup. Both were delicious and the soup was exactly what you would expect: creamy, and comforting. I'm doing a week without gluten and went there to see what options they had ( I knew they would) as far as treats go. I got their coconut macaroons and they were so yum! A little too sweet for me but that's fine because I was satisfied with just one. Amelie's is off the chain."}
{"text":"I had super high expectations for this place - I mean, Charlotte natives recommended it to me as the best dessert in town! As a dessert freak, of course I had to go. I had just been in Paris a couple of weeks ago, and I was missing macarons like crazy, so I had to come here and check the macs out here.

The result: uh, I was pretty disappointed. The macarons were really hard and crunchy. Definitely not the texture that macarons are supposed to be. Also super, super expensive - $2.29 a piece! The flavor of the macarons were alright (I had the honey buttercream and the mixed berry), but I just couldn't get past the hard texture. There was also such a small selection... I expected so much more.

However, I was super pleasantly surprised by the Salted Caramel Brownie, what seemed like the star dessert at Amelie's. I'm usually not the biggest fan of brownies of caramel, but the ooey-gooey-ness of the salted caramel brownie here was absolutely delicious. It looks like a very small and thin square, but it surely packs a big punch when it comes to flavor. It is super sticky though, so it's not the most pleasant thing to pick up with your fingers. Also, it's very sweet and decadent, so for the not-so-sweet-tooths, this brownie may not be the best option for you. But for me, it was fantastic.

Also, the ambiance of this location is great. If you walk along the side, the building just stretches super far. There are a lot more tables that I had originally expected and lots of cozy couches. Great place to do work or chat with friends. The couches are so comfortable that I even took a quick nap in one (haha, I just couldn't help it).

So overall, a pretty nice bakery in Charlotte. Don't get the macarons, but go for the brownie, and I heard the fruit tartes are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore everything about this place! The decor is so interesting. Every room is different! Make sure you go the whole way around! Cafe area seems small, but it is deceiving, because it loops around! The Macaroons are good enough to get you out of bed! Salted Carmel brownies! Enough said about that! Bring your friends and enjoy a cup of coffee out on the patio and enjoy the fall weather that's coming!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, amazing decorations, and I LOVE the macaroons! They have a variety of things to choose from. Great place to go with friends, relax, and chill."}
{"text":"What a gem! Give me an awesome 24 hour restaurant and I'll be your loyal follower forever. Delicious desserts and great coffee.

We will definitely be stopping by the next time we come through."}
{"text":"It's good but not great.  I don't get all the fuss, though.  La Patisserie in Mooresville is much better."}
{"text":"I went here for Brinner (breakfast for dinner). I was in Charlotte traveling for work and needed to get some work done so this place provided the perfect spot for me to do that. I got the following: 

-Bacon, egg and cheese croissant 
-fruit tart 
-salted caramel brownie 

All were really great. The croissant was a little overdone, but it was still that flaky croissant that you dream about if you are a pastry lover. The salted caramel brownie lived up to the hype--it was great, if you go here you have to get one. Some reviews claim it is overrated, I on the other hand really enjoyed it. 

The atmosphere here is great, there are a TON of places to sit down and work. I was here for about 3 hours and enjoyed it. The people watching was great and it wasn't too noisy. The only reason this place gets a 4 instead of 5 stars is the parking situation. I had to pay to park, $6 I believe. Then, where I parked was a garage that was connected to the building--easy to access during business hours, however, when I went to leave the establishment all the doors for easy access were locked. This forced me to walk outside and then have to climb up the ramps to the floor I parked on--this wasn't likely the safest option. Perhaps they should have special access to the garage during off hours...or some sort of a solution here. I would go back and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food: I don't remember the name of the bar I had but it was delicious! The bottom layer is a brownie, over that was a vanilla mousse-like layer, and over that was their signature salted caramel brownie. Somewhere in this layer of goodness there was something that added a nice crunch. It was sooo good! I tried my best to finish it but it was too sweet for me. It didn't stop me from finishing 3/4 of it though. 4/5

Service: Friendly and helpful with suggestions. 5/5

Final thoughts: I would definitely come back here. There was so much to choose from. Other than having baked goods, they also have food and drinks."}
{"text":"Incredible sweet treats from Amelie's! Love everything, would try something new each month and is always very satisfying! My teenage son would buy me surprise treats to earn himself brownie points and that always works!! Love Amelie's!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! When you first walk in it has it's own scene about it. Antiques all around, random art, photos of France... It's just all around a cool place to be in. And the food? Oh man! Heavenly! I'm sure you've already read in other reviews, but the caramel salted brownie is a \"must get\" on the menu. The dining areas are just so artsy and mellow that you'll enjoy whatever you're eating even more. Definitely a place to go if you're ever near downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amelie's is an adorable French bakery near NoDa. My favorites - of which there are many - include the lemon tea cakes, fruit tarts and chocolate mousse cups. 

It's a great place to relax and read a book or meet a friend for pastries and coffee. Amelie's has free wireless, which is a big plus. They stay open late on gallery crawl nights (first and third Fridays) and are hoping to get their wine license.

They also have a mini-Re-Store featuring antique furniture that's for sale through the Habitat for Humanity Re-Store."}
{"text":"Had a delish Strawberry Rhubarb tart there several weeks ago that I still dream about! Also, the salted caramal brownies are decadent. Love the Onion and Portobello Mushroom Soup! Little pricey but SO worth it! Artsy and unlike anywhere else!! One of my favorite finds since moving to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from North Jersey and this is the most delicious bakery I've tried yet.  They have these fabulous bars with a brownie bottom and a salty caramel like topping..I couldnt put it down! I got a whole bunch chocolate treats to try out with my roommate and we are instant fans.  The atmosphere is really relaxed and the workers so incredibly nice and helpful...not to mention it is 24 hours and all baking is done right on the premises :)
Love it!"}
{"text":"Pure heaven. Nuff said. Never had a bad experience here. Super cute decor. Uh, pastries are AMAZING. My favorites include the fruit tarts and croissants. Oh and the chicken salad is by far one of the best I've tried. Want a late night snack or early morning indulgence- oh yeaaaaah, they got you covered. Lol.  Open 24 hours. Score."}
{"text":"Great blueberry muffins!  So moist and not too sweet.  The cappuccino was ok and the service was lacking.  We waited forever while the workers just stood there talking to each other right in front of us, weird."}
{"text":"The employees were extremely friendly and kind from start to finish. Everything was so fresh and delicious. I'm glad we made a stop here. I'll definitely be coming back in the future and will recommend to my friends if they're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"What can I say...delicious!!  The famous salted caramel treat is awesome!!  The croissants are fabulous.  I love the vibe of this place..the decor is appealing to the eye...plenty of places to chill and relax...definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"A great bakery, but the baristas are never very pleasant.  When I ask for coffee with soy milk, they always tell me that you \"can't\" make that drink with soy milk.  I enjoy pastries here, but I'm not a coffee snob.  Complaining about making drinks with soy milk only pushes me to Starbucks."}
{"text":"There's a plethora of reviews singing about why this place is fucking awesome. My commentary is going to be hardly different in that vein, but seriously though. Seriously. It's bucket list good. What to get there? Everything. Ev-er-ee-thing."}
{"text":"Those soups though! I come back every weekend, and have yet to have even a regular soup. They are amazing every time. Butternut Squash! Mushroom Onion! Spinach Asparagus Leek! Tomato Crab! And best of all, they are gluten free! I don't know how they do it, but every time I come back, I find myself saying \"best soup of my life\" consistently mind blowing. Plus they have gluten free macaroons and gluten free salted Carmel brownies. Their chai creme is amazing, and the dirty chai is the best I have ever had. I drive half an hour almost every Sunday for it. Love this place."}
{"text":"Like stepping into a Dali fever dream, this 24-hour bakery is one of the most creative and appealing Charlotte haunts."}
{"text":"Amélie's may be a 15 plus minute walk from where I work Uptown, but that doesn't stop me from going here for lunch whenever I possibly can (hey, I'm getting steps in, right?). The moment you walk into this café - before you even see the food - the whimsy decor will make you fall in love. It's the epitome of a \"cute café\"! Perfect for your Instagram! The space is huge, by the way. It's a converted parking garage so it has two levels which are both big with lots of comfy seating (French cafe style tables, soft couches, and big tables for groups). Be warned, though: you may still have trouble finding seating during lunch hours :)

Now for the food. It's so good. Fresh and distinctly French. I usually opt for a sandwich, many of which are served warm. My favorite is turkey and brie, but all of them are good. They're served on baguette, which is crispy crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside (the best way!). And don't miss the bakery/pastry section! The macarons are divine.

Overall, Amélie's is a staple of my Uptown lunch faves. Go check it out if you're looking for some quick French food and decor that will brighten your day!"}
{"text":"This is one of a kind bakery. The decor and the atmosphere is really hip and I loved the french theme of the cafe. Their food was right in size and it was delicious. After dinner, i tried the chai latte and their mini creme brulee and they were great! Mini treats just melt in your mouth!! :)

This place is very classy and comfy. I loved it so much! My only complain is the restrooms. I felt like they should maintain a clean ladies room. It was not so clean so that's the only reason i am giving them 4 stars instead of five!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a very charming little place.  It has a large selection of baked goods.

It used to be fairly small, but recently they had a huge expansion and now they have lots of tables and seating.  So you can take advantage of the free wifi without feeling bad about taking up a table.

It's not a coffee shop, so coffee selection is limited to standard drip.  They do have french presses available which is pretty cool.  But don't expect Starbucks.  I would love it to see them eventually expand their coffee choices.

This is as good as it gets for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the pastries and atmosphere. The salted caramel brownies are orgasmic. I also recommend any of the layered tortes. My only complaint is that the counter is crammed up front which creates long lines. Otherwise, I think this is the best bakery I've ever been to... and I've been all over the world. It's sinfully good!"}
{"text":"I mean it's Amelies. You can't really go wrong as any good Charlotte native will tell you. I live in NYC now, but whenever I'm home, stopping by Amelies is a must. I still haven't found coffee like theirs and so whenever I'm down in Charlotte, I stock up and bring pounds of coffee back up with me. Seriously no place like it!

(P.S. Please open a location in NYC!!!)"}
{"text":"I'm not typically the 'hit the hip/trendy spot' kind of guy anymore.  But Amelie's new location uptown is just a great location.  Amble seating, and quick friendly service, Uptown Charlotte has needed a location like this for a casual afternoon sit-down coffee spot for a while and this place fits the bill perfectly."}
{"text":"Everything a pastry and coffee spot should be! Two words Russian Tea!

I didn't give 5 stars BECAUSE amongst the pastries that I order the chocolate croissant was stale! So disappointing since I was leaving town that very day! :( Other than that would recommend and suggest rolling through here anytime you're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this location. Less of a thrifty feel than the original location in Noda but still an eclectic vibe. Staff are always friendly. It's not 24 hours though. I understand why, I only wish on weekends the hours were longer than midnight."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go near Uptown Charlotte. Open 24 hours, I suggest the fresh fruit tarts and chicken salad sandwich!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but service horrible. Waited for 30 minutes only to have my breakfast sandwich come out wrong (without egg).  Should have done Dean and Deluca."}
{"text":"Love love love! Yummy coffee and pastries. The decor of this place is too cute and love all the nooks to hang out in."}
{"text":"Despite their awful business practices and allegedly poor treatment of their workers, they make excellent pastries and coffee. They are also a 24 hour joint. That's really all you can ask for in a town with few other all-night eateries. 

I get so bogged on just the pastries and coffee I haven't even tried their sandwiches which are probably also great.

My only complaint is the people. I'm a pretty antisocial person and not a hipster so everyone in the \"always-longest-line-ever\" line really bugs me. Just a personal thing but it still doesn't stop me from going so there's another testament to how good this place is."}
{"text":"Amazing French Cafe, great coffee and pastries.  Also can't beat the breakfast sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Simply can't get enough of this for lunch: 
Seeded roast beef sandwich (I get it without seeds) and Spinach Leek soup.
nothing better, and a super value, too! didn't really want to let the word out because it's hard to get a seat st lunchtime now that it's colder outside. But stop by - and don't forget to check out their awesome desserts!"}
{"text":"Boy and I stopped by after an afternoon stroll down NoDa for some sweet treats to go. Everything we purchased was wonderful (with the exception of a tiny vanilla cake which was lacking flavor and very waxy) our favorite treat is the salted caramel brownie by a long shot!"}
{"text":"First visit was great. I have no idea what I had then, but tonight was VERY poor. 

The macarons were trash, just horrible, and that is where they went immediately. They had great flavor, but were so incredibly dry and old they should have never been sold and certainly not on display. 

Unfortunately the salted caramel brownies were over cooked and the caramel applied to the brownie after it cooled- so it separated as soon as you started eating. Again tasted good but the texture and experience were poor.

Maybe just an off night but I didn't get that sense."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I think that my bad experience may be based on how busy they were. The parking lot was packed. After ordering, I tried to find somewhere to sit. I finally found a place in the atrium. Unfortunately it was too far away to use their wifi. After waiting about 20 minutes on my food, I decided to get it to go instead. The girl at the counter was very pleasant and helpful in getting it changed over. As soon as I got to outside I realized the cup of soup was spilling in the bag. Btw- it was portobello & onion, the mushroom seemed like an afterthought in decent french onion soup. I then noticed that the full sandwich I paid for looked very small(they only gave me 1/2 of my full sandwich-the pieces didn't match based on the diagonal cut). At this point, I didn't feel like even going back in to deal with the missing half sandwich.  I'm sure someone in the kitchen enjoyed it. I liked my half of the turkey and brie. I'll probably go back, but not if they are packed."}
{"text":"When in Charlotte, this is my study spot. The coffee is amazing!!! (Try the caramel latte, the closest thing that I had that was this great was from SAN Francisco)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I order salad to go every morning and a French macaron. The salads are huge! I love the spicy cucumber and edamame salad. It's my favorite along with the pistachio macaron. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Always the perfect choice for date night or after dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch. Really anytime is good. Definitely try the salted caramel brownie if you haven't before, but I usually get a tart or mousse cup. The turkey brie sandwich is AMAZING, and the plant-named drinks taste like plants, so don't be shocked."}
{"text":"This place is super creative and cute-I loved all the little decorations in each room!  We came here pretty early and barely beat the morning rush-yay.

So, I had the breakfast sandwich with sausage, spinach and cheese on a croissant.  It was super filling, but I also had to grab their salted caramel brownie (since the cashier said they've sold millions of their famous brownies, haha).  It was definitely sweet and unique!  Lastly, I had to drink up their mocha as well (I believe it comes with two espresso shots, so I just asked for one).  I was already all amped up from sugar!"}
{"text":"I love this local CLT haunt. The inside sort of reminds me of the mad hatters tea party - eclectic furniture all over, interesting chandeliers, and silly photos on the walls. It's a massive space located in uptown CLT. 

I enjoy the fresh squeezed orange juice and the croissant BEC sandwich. The bacon is cooked to perfection. 

I've toyed with getting the chicken salad before, but I was told that the secret ingredient is powdered sugar so I thought it might be a tad too sweet for me. 

It appears that there is an event space above the main level- it would be a perfect venue for a baby/bridal shower! 

Love it here!"}
{"text":"I visit every time I'm in Charlotte! The menu items are DELICIOUS, but the customer service is very questionable. I have had anywhere from awesome customer service to really poor customer service, however, the good outweighs the bad with this place. My only suggestion is to ensure the quality of customer service is consistent."}
{"text":"Excellent choice of pastries. The decor is nice and interesting as well."}
{"text":"Amelie's French Bakery and Cafe is a wonderful coffee shop and bakery with a unique and spacious atmosphere for studying, work, or just meeting friends.

The design is both Parisian and eclectic, featuring coffee, pastries, cafe food, and even lunch and wine. They've got open seating varying between tables and couches to give you that cozy coffee shop feeling. They've got bar seating, and even give you a view into the bakery with a large window. 

I ordered the cafe mocha, fruit Danish pastry, almond cake, raspberry lemon tart, and mixed fruit tart. The pastries were all tasty and fresh, and the cafe mocha had a nice deep chocolate flavor. Although the prices were on the expensive side, I think the location, atmosphere, and quality may warrant it. 

If you're in the area in search of your caffeine fix or for a place to relax, maybe pass up that Starbucks or convenience store coffee, and give them a try."}
{"text":"The icing on the petite cakes was complete garbage. Very dry and distasteful. Do not recommend. Ruined my night!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is great. A little overrated but best around town. Nice bakery and great macaroon. They can get a little packed so depending when you go, sometime you'll end up waiting 10-15 minutes before it's your turn. That was the longest I've waited but it was only once out of couple of times I've went there. Their stuff are a little over priced and the location does not have enough parking, especially if there's an event. Parking also isn't that great if you have to park on the gravel."}
{"text":"My two stars are for the decor and ambiance which are both quite cool.  There is an assortment of pastries behind the glass and decided to try a few.  Major disappointment!!  Pastries seemed stale with no flavor and the prices weren't cheap.  I did enjoy the artistic and unique touches around the place and think it would do much better as a gift shop instead of bakery."}
{"text":"Amelie's is great!!! They opened one on Pineville-Matthews Road and I stop by there on my way home pretty frequently! The Crew is nice and the pastries are fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"I went to Amelie's on a whim as I was driving by.  I am glad I did.  I ordered three things from the pastry section, I got a salted caramel he Claire, pumpkin caramel petit four, and a chocolate peanut butter petit four.  The The service was fantastic I was barely at the counter before somebody was helping me and I was checked out quickly despite them being in the middle of a Sunday brunch rush.  When I can do the food both the petit fours where phenomenal and I will probably come back again and try more of them.  The salted caramel eclair was good I wasn't particularly impressed, although I could see doing many other people takes far more than mine considering I usually prefer something of the sort to be a little more \"fluffy\", similar to a doughnut for lack of a better way to describe it.  However that is personal preference and says nothing against the eclair for eclair lovers.  I will definitely repeat in the future to try some more of their pastries."}
{"text":"I sampled some of their coconut macaroons at The Taste of Charlotte.  They were FANTASTIC.  I haven't actually made it to the shop yet, but will put it on my \"list of things to do on a Saturday\" list. Yay sugar! :D"}
{"text":"Very casual and relaxing place to eat. They have the best salted caramel brownies I have ever had."}
{"text":"I always go for the chocolate mouse. It has a very rich dark chocolate flavor with a tart strawberry on top to balance. There is a nice selection of macarons. The ambience is very hipster yet, you'll see many different types of people. It's a place that brings people together for what everyone loves most, sweets!"}
{"text":"I worked near Amelie's for a few months and quickly got familiar with the sweets, breakfast, lunch sandwiches, soups, coffees and teas. Everything here is top notch! Honestly you could choose blindfolded from the display case and you would not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yum! And what an adorable place to boot!! So I had an after lunch sweetness attack and was seeking out dessert of some sort. 

The fiancé had brought me these amazing french macaroons from here for Valentine's Day. So ofcorse when he suggested why don't we go. I happily agreed. First you walk in and the place has several different seating areas/ nooks, each perfect in its own way... The decore is eclectic French-ish  hipster but in a cute way, not at all pretentious. 

We went to the bakery case and I started drooling at the options. After much lamenting we settled on the Carmel pineapple macaroon, a mini coconut passion fruit chocolate cup and a jalapeño macaroon. My favorite was the jalapeño, it was this perfection of sweet but almost a hint of tangy. 

We sat at the bar and decided why not order a glass of bubbly each too :). We were celebrating cuz he just got a job offer! So with out prosecco and desserts we had quite the festive afternoon. 
This place is really great!! I'm glad I don't live here because I'd  probably weigh 500 pounds as I'm sure I'd find an excuse to celebrate something there on a weekly basis lol"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I can't believe I've never left a review! They're absolutely deserving of a 5 star rating! I've pretty much been to all of their locations, with the NoDA bakery being my favorite as it's less crowded and parking is easy and available. The service is always friendly and fast considering lines can get long. Their desserts are incredible! From the mini tarts, to the macaroons, to their pecan pies, and eclairs! 

But today I tried possibly the best dessert yet! The Lavender Lemon Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich filled with a lemon sorbet! HOLY SH#T!!!  

I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the decor alone. Nicely decorated this bakery is pretty big and you have many options on where to enjoy your mediocre dessert and coffee. 

The service was friendly, but the desserts are lacking. My vanilla strawberry cake was not soft and moist at all and my coffee was nothing out of the ordinary. 

It's definitely a tourist attraction if you're in the area but I wouldn't recommend going out of you way to have some good treats."}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about this place that I had to check it out. I love the ambiance. Very eclectic, really cute place. I got a cream cheese danish and I honestly expected it to be much better. It was greasy and the cream cheese inside was very rubbery. Not so impressed. My kids got the salted caramel brownie and since they inhaled them in 1.4 seconds I'm assuming they were fantastic!! The coffee was great. Next time I'll stay away from the Danishes and go for the brownie!"}
{"text":"Amelies...Amelies...how I love thee! There are so many good reviews on here. There isn't much left to say! Awesome decor, delicious desserts, eclectic environment. Their macaroons are TOO LIVE FOR! Everything I tasted were authentic French pastries. Nothing tasted American made! The staff is really friendly. They even have their own delicious smelling coffee! Nowhere in Charlotte will you find a place like this! Oh, but wait there's more! They are open 24 hrs! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Says the pregnant woman! Lovely place for you to do school work or to meet people. As a Charlotte native, I never thought the day would come where places like this would exist here. Love it! If you haven't been, go now! They're open! Lol"}
{"text":"I originally came for the pastries but have found great coffee and have been really impressed with their sandwiches for both breakfast and lunch.
Their breakfast sandwiches are big portions and customizable. I don't think I've had the same combo twice. Their Turkey and Brie is delicious and always leaves me wanting a second one because it's so good. One of my favorite sandwiches in the city.
I do wish they had some more comfortable sitting locations to be able to sit and read. It seems like their other locations do. A line just for a cup of coffee could move things along on a Saturday morning. But then, how could they entice you with contents they show of fin their case?"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are really for the decor and ambiance of this place. I am a serious lover of most things French and cute... and this place had all of that and more! I was a little disappointed by their pastries (specifically their macarons), but that could also be attributed to the fact that we went at 1am on a Saturday night (have you ever heard of a bakery that's open 24/7?! crazy!).

I would really just come back to this place to sit around and soak in all the little je ne sais quoi-s, but I will have to try their pastries again probably during \"normal business hours.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable, casual breakfast spot near Wells Fargo and Duke.  Charming!  Busy at the start of the day but worth waiting a few extra minutes."}
{"text":"For a bakery they are depressingly bare. The space is large with plenty of seating but they were out of all pastries except for eclairs and macaroons! 

I asked if they sold chocolate and they said no. Just chocolate croissants which they are out of. 

Being open 24/7 and as expensive as they are I would hope for more variety, I'd recommend calling ahead to see what they have left before coming."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the the quality of the food or drink.  Lots of the pastries looked old and many tasted old.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, coffee and pastries.
Really fantastic. The staff? Entitled hipsters who think they are too cool. 
The people? Another group of hipsters who give you dirty looks if you attempt to sit near them with a toddler. Well behaved toddler I must add, I guess. 
Oh sorry, I don't mean to interrupt your new normal of sitting like a zombie staring at your phone."}
{"text":"The coffee is very good and an alternative to my usual Starbucks morning coffee run, but the pastries and cakes were disapointing to say the least. For first thing in the morning you would expect fresh and crisp, but they were soft and stale. The atmosphere of the new downtown location was very nice though, and it would be a great place for a meeting over coffee. Hope they get the bakery side running properly soon or they will find it difficult to stick around. Willing to give their breakfast and lunch food a try. So stay tuned."}
{"text":"This is a trendy bakery/cafe.  It is good for a nice cup of coffee and treat after dinner or drinks.  The pastries are all good, but if you go later at night some aren't as fresh as they could be (hazard of going late I realize which is why they still get 4 stars).  I'm a tea drinker and the variety isn't as good as other cafes in Charlotte, but definitely is a great place for a group to go after a night out to wind down.  It also has nice sandwiches if you're looking for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Pro- tip. Start with a bike ride from freedom park. Bike for a little over 2 miles to park road shopping center and stop in for an iced coffee and maybe a sweet before heading back to freedom park. A great way to spend a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I never, never eat anything out of the amazing dessert cases, Amelie's provides a great bakery and coffeehouse experience. Good WiFi, and you can usually cozy up to a power outlet if you need to. The staff is typically young, and can sometimes come off with an unfriendly attitude (but maybe they are just shy/confused). The vibe is funky and sprawly, the coffee is good and if they are able to retain commited baristas, there is hope for the espresso as well. Having spent time and money in Parisian bakeries on many occasions spanning decades, Amelie's seems a bit pricey on the bakery side to me. But with it being such a rarity in Charlotte there is a supply/demand thing at work here that seems to justify the expense."}
{"text":"Good food as always but holy cow, a 45 minute wait in line for a decent sandwich is ridiculous. Seriously Amelie's, open up a few more registers, ask your cashiers to work more quickly, or find a way to more efficiently take people through the line. We brought a decent sized group and there were a lot of mistakes and very late food. Will never compare to the original! Definitely glad for a more accessible location though and absolutely worth going. Just don't go during peak hours if you're in a hurry. Also smells a lot like paint."}
{"text":"This was a really good bakery! Definitely somewhere you'd want to go with friends, no matter the time of day or night. I came here at 2:30am one night and there were still so many people there. Definitely a safer spot in an otherwise sketchy neighborhood.

I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE the pecan tart! It's amazing. I had their iced coffee, too. It was pretty good, nothing to rave about though.

The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the fact that they don't have as much of an array of treats later at night. Otherwise, a solid spot."}
{"text":"Cute little 24 hour bakery. There is a large array of pastries and drinks. The location is good but parking can be troublesome (I've warned you). 
The pastry is rich in quality and extremely filling in my opinion."}
{"text":"Coffee was the best I've ever had! Atmosphere is awesome! Line was long but from what I hear it always is. Macaroons had a good flavor but the texture wasn't quite up to par with Tartsweet (my favorite place in Winston-Salem). Overall very good and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing...seldom found: a true patisserie! 
Casual tables, a variety of seating areas...a dreamy iced coffee and fabulous pastry..with more to take home! What to choose is the problem: eclairs, croissants, muffins like you've never seen, tarts..a variety never seen in Charlotte I'm sure. 

And lunch of course....next time, for sure!"}
{"text":"Cool little French restaurant.  Nice decor.  The breakfast sandwiches are really good, and the coffee (latte) was delish as well.  Great place to visit in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"MORE PLEASE Times a million! 

I heard so much about their salted caramel brownies I just had to try it on my trip passing. Yes ma'am and yes sir. I'm not one for lines but this is a place where I will make exceptions. They were THAT good!

Also had the chicken salad on crossiant. The best part about a bakery that makes their own croissants is they come out sandwich ready. Flaky,delicious...

And wifi!! 

Must come back because the mini sweet potatoe cake deliciousness makes me want more this second."}
{"text":"Amelie's is the best bakery in Charlotte! The vanilla eclair is to DIE for! I've tried tons of things here and the eclair is definitely the best! Love love love it! We go there all the time! The atmosphere is great and relaxed as well. Very interesting decor as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax and get some work done while enjoying some great food. It's also a great spot for a date. The inside is cute, hip and comfy."}
{"text":"We tried this spot after hearing about it for years for an after dinner dessert and coffee stop.  It was a Saturday night, around 8:30 PM- and it was PACKED!!!  

There was an overwhelming line- my husband didn't want to wait but we were there and first timers so I encouraged him to stay.  The line wrapped down the hall and all the way through the seating area!  I was expecting something good for this line!!!

When we finally made it to the front I felt rushed and made a game time decision for a piece of berry and buttercream cake.  My husband got a fruit tart and another flaky pastry.  All were good, but not amazing.  I waited until I was home to enjoy my cake because it wasn't good chilled- the frosting was hard as a rock.

Our lattes were tasty.  But, at $17 for two coffees and a treat we may not be back unless we are in NODA."}
{"text":"Nice place. Quiet. Might be because it is a bit new. The pate sandwich is awesome in its simplicity. The cappuccino are well executed. So many pastries too."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for some dessert and to see the selection, but was pretty happy with what I got. I thought it was a bit pricey, but I expected as much given the prime location downtown. It was nice that they were open late, as I was staying in a hotel in the area and just wanted to get out for light snack. Desserts themselves were great - the peach tart was delicious, macaroon was perfect, and brownie was good but a little hard. That was the only one I didn't care to finish. Definitely a place I'll stop by again next time I'm in town, hopefully to grab some lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after reading in the paper about their macaroons had the Salt and pepper that had cream  cheese in the middle and strawberry and rhubarb which were both delicious
When you see the price $2.29 each it seems a little high but after you taste them you see why!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here this morning to have a quick breakfast. It's walking distance from the Hilton we were staying at. The food was amazing. We had a croissant breakfast sandwich & coffee. I wish I lived closer I would definitely visit more often. I hope they expand & open more locations!"}
{"text":"This place is a Charlotte staple. The salted caramel brownies are amazing! I ask for one every day on my birthday. They also have great breakfast baguette sandwiches and coffees/teas. The decorations here are so unique and fun to look at. It's a great place to work remotely or have a meeting. They also have an event space for bridal showers, baby showers, etc."}
{"text":"Best BEC croissant I've ever had, consistently. Great coffee to go with it. Love the atmosphere, cozy for meeting clients or getting work done via free wifi."}
{"text":"This sort of new location is big. Very big. Feels almost institutional. We ran into a long line/s which sort of messed up the visit too. They just needed some basic organization to be able to run things more smoothly. 

Pastries are excellent."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the 3rd location in Charlotte. Are there anymore ? This location is just as quirky, pretty and French as the others . Settled in for my favorite menu items : macaroons and a hot tea. Lots of space and lots of outlets to charge devices. Great for meet-ups, homework, people watching....maybe a little loud for homework on the weekends though. I always try to bring family here when they come to Charlotte, because the food is always good, and the location is always unique. It's French, but not in an intimidating way. There's something for everyone here."}
{"text":"This is where I bring friends and family from out of town, because I can't go wrong. I usually woo them in with the salted caramel brownie, then let them explore the rest of the menu once inside. Amelie's has a great selection of French desserts in addition to a tasty bistro menu. DO NOT SLEEP on the bistro menu!!!! Prior to inhaling your macaroons, try one of their croissant sandwiches . If you're between meals but want a snack, try a baguette with truffle butter spread. So delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter raved about this place so we tried it. It's just Ok for me as I have had much better pastries elsewhere. I don't live near this place so most likely I will not go back. We went on Sunday 8pm, the place was packed and desserts were continuously brought out from the kitchen. It was too late in the evening to have espresso so couldn't comment on it."}
{"text":"LOVE this delightful little place except on Friday & Saturday nights!! - SO busy but still worth it. ;)"}
{"text":"What a disaster. This place does not live up to the hype.  The pastries were dry, coffee just so-so and the service was clueless. The Uptown location tries to be 'lively and hip' but it comes off as plastic and busy. Better places to spend my time and $'s"}
{"text":"I had a creamy goodness overdose! I visited from out of town and my friends really hyped this place up. I was a bit skeptical but they lived up to the hype and then some. I'd have never heard of a 24hr bakery but after trying a few items I understand why. I typically want a greasy burger after a 2am bar night but this place wold give a greasy burger a run for my money. we went all out and spend $70 on creamy goodness. I personally tried about 5 different mini-tarts, a napoleon, a salted brownie (sounded gross but tasted great) and some Tiramisu Creme Brule. This place but 3 pounds on me over the weekend. This place is serious business! Bring your taste buds and leave your diet at home."}
{"text":"The fact that this fabulous bakery is open 24/7 is alone reason to appreciate it.  (This is not anything like the 24/7 Wendy's.).  we had the"}
{"text":"once upon a time
there was a french bakery
open all the time.

Wow Charlotte, you are amazing.  An amazing bakery, coffee shop, French open 24/7.  This is a grad student dream.  This is a macaroon lover-dream.  This is a coffee drinker insomniac paradise.  Seriously.  Go here.  Eat here.  Study here.  Sleep here. Be happy."}
{"text":"I came to pick up dessert to bring over to a friend's house. I came around 5 pm on a Friday and there was no wait. The salted caramel brownie was a real crowd pleaser -- very rich, good for sharing because with just a few bites you'll satisfy your sweet tooth! I also bought 3 mini cakes and a lemon raspberry tart. These were decorated super cute (visually perfect) and were pretty yummy. Would probably do without the tart next time but it might have been because I was in the mood for something more decadent.

Large open space. Convenient street parking. Friendly service. A great place for dessert!"}
{"text":"My daughter introduced us to this bakery last night.  The display was amazing; making it difficult Not to order everything!  So, we got macaroons, croissants, caramel brownies, these little chocolate cap things, and cheese croissants.  Everyone enjoyed their orders.  We will be back for more."}
{"text":"very good overall.  The desserts are the best!  Can't go wrong with anything there.  If there is a small criticism about Amelie's, it's only the house coffee.  While it's fine, it is not excellent like their desserts.  I would highly recommend the uptown location.  Very cool building and great staff."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite Amelie's location!  Plenty of places to sit, plenty of places to work and plenty of places to park!  The staff is friendly and overall excited about working.  

The food is great!  In addition to taking all of our friends here when visiting Charlotte, we have used Amelie's to cater a few recent events: baby shower, Baptism Brunch, round-table political events and more.  

I highly recommend this for your next work meeting or event."}
{"text":"Each of the locations offer a unique vibe - but I love the original NoDa location.  24/7 access to good coffee and great pastries.  I'd highly recommend as a place to have meetings or casual get-togethers.  Also - their pastries make a great gift :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after it was recommended to me. The food was really good, I ordered a breakfast sandwich, and it was delicious. I also ordered a cheese danish, and it was ok. I personally think Panera's is better, but the breakfast sandwich made up for it. I was a little annoyed that me and my daughter had ordered the same thing, but I guess she thought I only said one. We ended up splitting it, and it really was enough for both of us."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. The salted caramel brownies are possibly the most delicious things in Charlotte. I love the cozy nooks and crannies and the ample places to plug in my laptop. I love the cool atrium out back (check it out if you haven't yet), where it's still possible to find some quiet. I love that they are open 24 hours a day. I love the fussy decor. I love it all...except the prices. They're a little proud of their pastries, and everything costs about a $1 more than it should."}
{"text":"Nice folks working there. Went on a Friday night for dessert. The strawberry cream cake would have benefited from a little warming before serving, but it was good. 

As a suggestion to management: Put the names of the macaroons on the end of the tray holding each flavor. The amount of time wasted by each customer asking for a recitation (sometimes more than once) slows the line unnecessarily. If you're going to stock a dozen flavors, then make the effort to explain what you're selling."}
{"text":"Awesome, unique place!  Pastries were delicious, had the strawberry-cream cheese croissant and a variety of fudges! All great!"}
{"text":"Love love love their Napoleon sheet cake. Best I've found in charlotte. It's quite large wish it was a bit smaller. For calorie purpose. Everything is quite pricey but worth it. Also tried the macaroons relish. Also a nice place to hang well if we didn't have the kids."}
{"text":"Wife loves this place. Our French foreign exchange student said the croissants were not like in France and needed more butter.  The croque monsieur was not like in France because there was mustard and it is served on a croissant.   The baguette was close to French standards but the Brie was not good. This was on my sandwich.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Espresso was incredibly sour. Quiche was still cold in the middle. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place ever. Everything is so good. It's a perfect place to come and do work, as there is free wifi. My favorite items are the salted caramel brownie and the key lime tart"}
{"text":"I love all of their delicious treats. The food is always yummy and fresh. The staff is polite and well informed about the products. Unfortunately there is normally  very long waiting line, fortunately the staff is very fast so they got what i thought was going to be a 45 minute wait into a 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"The shop in Carmel Commons is where we ate and what a great experience!!  Food is everything it is said to be!!  Excellent!!"}
{"text":"I love their desserts...it was delicious.  And as a sweet bonus, they have the fence/gate where you can put a lock with your loved one :-D"}
{"text":"I am so psyched--I have one of their new mugs that you can get for about $13, so now every time I go refills of their liquid heaven are only $1!! Deal of the century---now I really wish they would open one closer to Salisbury!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here twice in a row. The coffee was absolutely perfect and the scenery is really cool. If you are looking for breakfast try the egg, sausage and cheese on a croissant. Flakey, buttery and just the right amount of egg.

Update: Went again and everything was perfect. From the cappuccino to the croissant."}
{"text":"LOVE the Amelie's in NoDa, so was very excited for this one to open closer to our home. Came here with the plan to eat lunch (turkey brie sandwich was delicious!), drink some French press (yum!) and do some work on my laptop. 

Unfortunately, wifi was AWFUL (I came at 1:30 p.m., so maybe the lunch rush was to blame?), and when I did connect, everything moved at a snail's pace. Had to leave because I couldn't get anything done. Be warned if you plan on working from here. (I realize this is not a review of the food/drinks, but part of the appeal of this huge space, I thought, was the ability to camp out for several hours working.)"}
{"text":"Best destination to reach at any time of the day when u r a little hungry. Love the deserts here. Good place to hangout!"}
{"text":"This local bakery has been so successful they opened up a few different locations. My experience is with the one downtown. They have a huge space with lots of natural light, exposed ductwork, and a cement floor. There is light coloring on the walls and the décor is very funky, a bit of a mix of Alice in Wonderland meets Louis the XIV. The main bakery area sits behind a big glass window, giving you a look into the delicious pastry creation. Their baguette is on point, crusty on the outside, fluffy in the middle, served with sweet cream butter and a little jam, magnifique. A rainbow of macaroons and very chocolatey and dense brownies are also among their specialty. Eat in, take out, either way, falling down this Parisian rabbit hole is worth a trip."}
{"text":"It's a 24 hour bakery in the heart of NoDa. What's not to love? 

It's a bit pricey but this is definitely in the top 5 places that I recommend to those who are just now venturing into Charlotte. It's really difficult not to buy one of everything simply because you can smell pastries and chocolate in the parking lot. You're salivating before you reach the door. This place can definitely get busy during lunch and also at night and sometimes the line wraps around to the back door but it moves quickly and its worth the wait. The only problem I have run into is being able to find a place to sit with friends, but there is usually always plenty of room outside or around back. If this place served alcohol, I don't think I would ever leave."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We had some pastries and ' cafe capuchoin' . They were pretty decent. Nice place to catch up with freinds. There were many people with their laptops, kinda like starbucks environment. It is decorated with vintage stuff. Will definitely comeback!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while exploring Charlotte with two others. What a cute little cafe/bakery! The atmosphere instantly takes you into relax mode, this is an ideal place to study or read. They were out of a few items, which only shows the quality of the food and the freshness of the product- if they only order a minimum amount at once, you know that it's going to be as fresh as can be. The sandwiches were wonderful, but we found them lacking only in a side item. A small fruit or green salad, or an offer of a bag of chips would have made the meal seem complete. Instead, we went back and ordered a side salad and bowl of crab soup to share. The bowl of soup was a meal in itself, the portion was very generous, and incredible! It was a tomato-y bisque with a little heat and a good amount of crab, with a few slice of french bread. The salad we took togo, because the soup was too delicious to let go to waste. We also shared two of the mini key lime tarts which were fabulous! My only complaint would be that the pricing is a little high for single items, if the sandwiches/soups/salads came with a small accompaniment, I would have no problem with the pricing, because the food was delicious.
Will return with a kindle on the next rainy day!

Visited Aug 2011"}
{"text":"Love the coffee Melange along with all the tasty treats!  If your getting a breakfast sandwich ( egg whites, cheese and spinach - yummy) in the morning (7:30a - 8:30a) be prepared to wait up to 20 min. While its worth the wait if your running late for work get there early!"}
{"text":"Finally, I was able to try the desserts! Went here the very first week I was in Charlotte to meet a new friend over a yummy cream soda. Super cute decor, plenty of space to just chill. 

This time, there was a live band playing. Had a difficult time in deciding which dessert I wanted, but the wait staff were helpful and patient. I ended up choosing the Ganache and Raspberry jam tart, the ganache and raspberry part were delicious but the crust was too dry. Tried the Key Lime tart and loved it, again the crust was too dry, but the lime flavor really came out in the filling. Also tried the chocolate mousse cup, didn't really enjoy this one, mousse filling was tasty, but the chocolate cup threw it off. 

I'll have to come back often to try more goods. Great atmosphere and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Great coffee, good treats and fantastic atmosphere. Have been here for anything from book club to a first date. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delightful cute little French restaurant with tasty breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and salads. 

Service: The lines are long at times.  However, the service is OK. I went three times during one visit in Charlotte. Sometimes people working there were nice; other times, they were not so friendly. 

Ambiance: The cutest!  Lots of decorations line the walls; there are chandeliers and fun decor.   The tables have interesting paint jobs. 

Food: 
Pastries: Most were tasty, some were ok. The apple pie had the most delicious cobbler-kind of crusty that was moist and crumbly. The tarts had a very hard almost - cookie crust, not as good. The brownies were just ok. 

The breakfast sandwiches!!! The egg sandwiches on baguettes were delicious. The eggs themselves had great flavor. One can choose meat, vegs and/or cheese for these. Also, a croissant can be the bread option instead of the white baguette. These are so filling and good. 

Salads: Are huge. The radish cucumber salad is paired with a tasty peanut type dressing. 

Drinks: I had some sort of fancy mimosa that tasted tart and fizzy with a buzz.  I did not order other drinks, but noted that they had numerous options."}
{"text":"Conveniently 24hrs, awesome macaroons (I didn't try them all), but definitely a bit pricey. I haven't tried my salted caramel brownie yet, but I hear great things. The croissant was nothing special, to be honest, I wonder if I could've asked for it to be warmed up, now that I'm thinking about it."}
{"text":"We love macarons so we splurged and got one of each flavor! They were all so good!! We also got a cream puff which was awesome and a coconut macaroon which was good too. We shared a cafe marcotter ( vanilla bean simple syrup, steamed milk, espresso, caramel sauce & sea salt ) and it was gone so fast! We loved it all"}
{"text":"I stopped by Amelie's with my wife today around 5.p.m. and ordered a chicken salad on croissant. The croissants felt like it has been out all day. It was hard both inside and outside. This was the worst experience i have had with Amelie's. I will give them another chance.I paid too much for the food to get a sun-standard sandwich."}
{"text":"I love the creme Brûlée !! Also had some type of raspberry lemon tart. To die for! This place is 
A hidden Charlotte gem"}
{"text":"Great selection of pastries. Nice dirty soy chai latte. Cool ambiance.  A very busy and happening spot in the Queen City. I'd probably hang out here if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"Both unique and stylish, Amélie's French Bakery serves its guests with more than just yummy, can't-have-enough confectionaries! My girlfriend suggested that we check this place out after driving by it one day, and we haven't regretted that decision since. We will drop by Amélie's every once in a while to get our hands on their tasty eclairs. And sometimes, we drop by just to look around! The decor is phenomenal, and we would probably stick around longer if we weren't just taking up space. Yes, prepare to stand in a crowded room that follows after the skinny corridor!

And yeah, sure, the line was long. Even so, I'll give it a pass. Everything ran quickly and efficiently, and not once did I have to demand attention from the smiling young man working behind the counter. Great service in an unlikely place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is good. They used to have the best chicken salad but they changed the recipe or something. It's not as good. My fave is the salted caramel brownie and mixed berry tart. I only try to go once in awhile because everything is so high in calories. But def a great place to get sweets. Good parking. Awesome location. Open 24 hours. Nice staff. Great place to come chill and get online. Some interesting characters frequent this place. It's fun to people watch. I have overheard some of the wildest convos while I'm sitting there minding my business."}
{"text":"Salted Carmel brownies, and coconut macaroons are my fave!! Their eclairs  are also awesome."}
{"text":"It's only 1 star short b/c I've only been once. I had some spinach&leek soup which also had carrots, potatoes, etc. and it was DELICIOUS. also had a fresh fruit tart which was good too. what i loved the most was its interior. lots and lots of different places to sit! chairs at all kinds of different tables, little couches...there were several little areas or corners where you could study alone or with a group. I think they also have free wifi. It was like being in a home. Lots of unique decor and delicious pastries. Definitely would like to go again. And again and again and again...might I also add it's the first French place I actually liked!"}
{"text":"Amelie's has been once of my favorite places since high school.  We go here often and the atmosphere and pastries are A+++"}
{"text":"Came here for a late afternoon snack while visiting Charlotte and loved it. Pastries are great also had the citrus vanilla cake. Great ambiance come check this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. Great ambiance. They have a wonderful bakery with assorted pastries, a cafe, and regular food. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Great tomato crab bisque!  I tried the ham and cheddar quiche. It was okay. I also got the limonade, but it was not very good I didn't realize it would be fizzy. Love the macaroons."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and cozy atmosphere.  Yummy mocha latte and tasty nibbles.  Great place to hang with your laptop and get work done while sipping on great coffee."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. Always nice food and the chai latte is very tasty. We go to Park Rd one most often."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to make a impromptu ride to Amelie. Which was the best decision ever. The environment was wonderful and calming. I had the salted caramel mocha which was delightful. Will definetly return."}
{"text":"After multiple times trying to duplicate my wonderful experience with their uptown location I have given up.  On multiple occasions the staff has been unprofessional and far from warm and inviting. The other problem that is as equally disappointing is the quality of their baked goods. Inconsistent at best. Which is very upsetting since we so looked forward to it's arrival. We live in Ballantyne just a short distance away.  I really wanted a new go to place. I would suggest either going uptown to their premier bakery or find anywhere else for half the price and equal quality."}
{"text":"Celebrating Devins occasion and he selected Amelies.  We enjoyed the fruit tart, Provence BLT, Ham and gruyere tartine.  Shark eyes all around."}
{"text":"Just incredible food. Great coffee, Great food, and a beautiful seating area. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I just wish it was bigger! Things that are this amazing deserve spaces as giant as their customer base! when i say giant i mean on friday nights the line wraps around the entire building into the hallway and then some. Wish we had more 24 hr places like this is charlotte! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My dining mate and I stopped at this French  bakery and cafe  for coffee. This restaurant has great ambience ,   lots of color, good  lighting  and  many decorations that adorn the walls.  Just a very pretty and comfortable place to sit and enjoy the beautiful great variety of pastries, cookies, tartlets, quiches, croissant sandwiches, soups, salads, assortment of rolls, desserts etc.  plus a coffee bar.
My dining mate ordered a latte which came with a steamed milk design  that adorned the top. He said it was delicious.
We split a French maccaroon just to try one.
Delicious but pricey,  as one cost about $2.50.
The restaurant was packed at lunch, food looked great from the diners sitting around us.
A must try for lunch.
Open 7 days a week, but hours vary.
A great find we think."}
{"text":"Always nice and kind people and DONT FORGET THE SWEEEETS open all the time and best place for studying"}
{"text":"Hard to not like anything about this place. Kids love getting \"special treats\" here and makes for a great family date spot"}
{"text":"Weirdly decorated French Bakery with amazing tasting desserts. Hands down the best salted Carmel brownies. Def my favorite and they have sold over one million of them. You can expect to pay like over $2.50 for everything. Can't go wrong with their macaroons either! Decently sized and never tasted one I didn't like (always have several flavors at least). The tarts are good, several options there. We have tried cake once and wasn't impressed at all, so I recommend sticking to the SCB or macaroons, or tarts. Not the mention the cakes are $5ish. There's usually a long line so be prepared to wait, it usually moves at a decent pace. Giving 4 stars for the lines and the higher price (but worth it ). Place is decently sized but usually so popping can be challenging to find a seat sometimes."}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite coffee shop in Charlotte, even if they do not have the best coffee. The place is huge with plenty of seating be it tables, sofas or awesome air chairs. They also usually have great music playing which earns extra points in my heart. When I go I always get the french press because I have gone a few times in the past where the drip coffee had been cold, so annoying. The pastry selection is overwhelming in a good way because everything seems to be good, at least from what I have had with the macaroons being my favorite. They also serve real food, the soups are great as are the sandwiches. On the weekends they serve quiche which is among some of the best I have eaten."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to say I get the same thing every time I go... an egg sandwich on a buttery soft and flakey croissant.  The coffee is great and the atmosphere is even better. It's a great place to have quick business meeting or sit and focus to get work done."}
{"text":"My first ever salted caramel brownie was from the Uptown Charlotte location. I fell in love."}
{"text":"Very good selections. Like that their drink menu changes seasonally. Very traditional French pastries. Only drawback was price and if you want your Napoleon not frozen be sure to ask for that specifically, the normal way is where the custard layers are frozen."}
{"text":"Amelie's is sweet little cozy spot to read and hangout with some friends. They have a lot of options to choose from I really just like the atmosphere in NoDa so I go here some evenings to grab a pastry. Check them out if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"My second time in I was a bit disappointed.  My sandwich was small (very little meat) and half warmed up.

Like the concept of the restaurant, it's cute inside and seems like it would be a great place for lunch, but I wasn't impressed today.  :(

I still love the spreads. Had feta and Gouda spread- delicious!  Though they don't give you any bread or crackers to go with them - a bit chintzy if you ask me!"}
{"text":"AMELIE'S: A LOVE - HATE RELATIONSHIP.

Like the French, Amélie's is a dichotomy.
 
I love France and French people in general. 
I hate haughty Parisians. In fact, most French people hate Parisians. LOL.
I love Louis Vuitton leather goods, so maybe I would be considered haughty too? 
C'est possible.

I love French food and wine, period. 

French people shop for fresh bread and food on a (sometimes twice) daily basis. 
They insist on fresh or the shop keeper will receive a \"tsk, tsk, tsk.\"
French people demand BETTER - everything.

Enough digression.....what about Amélie's?

First of all, let me say that like: country living, farm to table, and barbecue's recent popularity with the masses - I loved Amélie's before Amélie's was cool.
 http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=i+loved+country+before+country+was+cool&FORM=VIRE3#view=detail&mid=87AA32AA8D841EDA1A4787AA32AA8D841EDA1A47

I like the décor and concept of Amélie's, more than I care for their execution.
The same thing can be said for the old Citroen 2CV.
 http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=citroen+2+cv&FORM=HDRSC2

Their desserts LOOK inviting, but sometimes appearances....well, you know.
 http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=lindsay%20lohan&qs=ds&form=QBIRMH

I have found their signature salted caramel brownie to be hit or miss. 
When it's \"ON,\" there's absolutely nothing better. Nothing. C'est formidable.
When it's \"OFF,\" and the sugar is improperly caramelized. 
C'est dommage. Quelle disaster!

The same thing goes for their macaroons, which are frequently stale.
Expensive and stale are two things that I don't equate or happily associate.
  
How is this possible with their constant horde of customers 24/7? 
Vraiment? Comment est-ce possible? {French shoulder shrug.}
http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=french%20shoulder%20shrug&qs=ds&form=QBIRMH#view=detail&id=2C1A301DC8A62EA443194005E95536C97D5A3A24&selectedIndex=3

I think that this place is fairly expensive and a little over-priced. 
Being \"French\" doesn't mean that an item is automatically good or worth $6. 
Parisian prices for the uninitiated. 

DIACHOTOMY?

LOVE: I have found their employees to be friendly and helpful, when they have the time. The last tattooed, NCIS \"Abby\" lookalike, Goth girl server - was truly fabulous.
http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=abby%20ncis&qs=ds&form=QBIR 

HATE: The wait. There is one service line and they desperately need two.

LOVE: I love the French music playing in the background. 
I instantly recognized \"La vie en rose,\" which was popularized by Edith Piaf.

LOVE: There are plenty of French food choices on their beautifully inscribed black board. http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=french%20menu%20blackboard&qs=ds&form=QBIR#view=detail&id=FA9F904BF3F39869620E7B3E7629B41FC45EE59E&selectedIndex=6

LOVE: Being open 24/7 is fantastic, if not a little unrealistic. 

CONCLUSION:
 
- Amélie's started as a FIVE star place for me. {LOVE}

- Then I got the bill, and it dropped to a FOUR. {HATE} http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=expensive%20bill&qs=ds&form=QBIR#view=detail&id=F4C16DF4ECB8E99B95623C7C7227A6CC5284B2AF&selectedIndex=37

- My last drive across Charlotte netted a substandard salted caramel brownie, so down to a THREE. {Disappointed} ;o(

- I have sadly discovered that many of Amélie's reviews since November 2014 have been fake, copied Google+ or Trip Advisor reviews, so guess what - down to TWO stars. I find this highly unethical, extremely saddening, and completely unnecessary. {SMH}

Despite my recent disappointments, Amelie's has a friendly, warm, inviting feel of a French café, and there's always the possibility that the salted caramel brownie will be properly made that day....so I always visit Amélie's when I journey to Charlotte to eat or shop. 

Que plus tard mes amis. À bientôt."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews from the other locations. The husband and I went for desert on date night. The place was really busy. I chose a torte and he chose a strawberry cake...sorry for the lack of description.  Bottom line is that the pastries were just ok. Nothing to write home about. Service was just ok as well. I would return simply because there are no other bakeries of this kind in the area. It's a relaxed atmosphere which is nice. Great for dates and just chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Not only does Amelie's have yummy food and desserts, but the atmosphere is absolutely amazing. It has become my ultimate work/hang out space, and I always feel inspired when I'm there.

As far as the delicious sweets go, they have a little of everything for varying palettes. Something light and airy or something sweet and heavy. Regardless, it'll leave your mouth watering.

If you're looking for something more savory, the roast beef on croissant is TO DIE FOR, and their soups are excellent, especially the french onion.

This is most definitely a place to hit up as much as possible, even if just grabbing a drink (I love the orange cream soda) and sticking your nose into your laptop."}
{"text":"Alright, this place is a wish come true for those of you like me that seem to crave sweets at the weirdest times. 24 hours of yummy treats! 

The reason I take a star off is due to the crowd and the line (though it was a Saturday night) and the price which I thought was a little too high. 

That being said, I whole-heatedly believe it is worth it. I got macaroons, a little chocolate mousse stack with a raspberry on top, and a salted caramel brownie. They were all delicious and by the happy faces and the line itself, I assume most of their items are the same. 

It has a really neat and creative ambiance and is cozy with a lot of seating inside as well as a few tables outside.

The service was great and the workers interacted with the customers and knew the products well. There seemed to be enough of everything, and the staff was super friendly. Overall, very good and I absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"My friend picked me up a macaroon - I was sadly unimpressed. It was not delicate as I had anticipated but rather bulky, chewy and on the stale side. Really disappointing"}
{"text":"Everything here is great. My personal favorites are eclairs and macarons, but be sure and give the coffee a try too!"}
{"text":"Delicious tarts and excellent iced latte! This place was like a page out of Alice and wonderland and I loved it!"}
{"text":"Amelie's pretty much just serves up amazingness on a plate. Hands down one of the best bakeries that I have been too. Everything I tasted was delicious. My favorite was the bread pudding, as it is absolute greatness. Once you order it, they finish cooking the bread pudding for another 10 minutes so that it is delivered to your table tasting fresh out of the oven. The strawberry vanilla cake was good also(be sure to let it get to room temp before eating). I'm definitely a fan of Amelie's and will definitely be back whenever I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Took my sister here when she was visiting from out of town, by out of town I mean a tiny island thousands of miles away. We went to the one in Uptown. It's very over priced (almost $11 for two flavored coffees), but other than that the atmosphere is fun and eclectic. The decorations are neat and there are cute souvenirs, which are always good for tourists such as my sister."}
{"text":"Flavors will not disappoint. Quite expensive and staff can be a bit aloof. Vibe if you eat in is sublime."}
{"text":"Updating the initial review. I did return to this location with my family last weekend.  Definitely a totally different experience.  Kept things simple on the beverage side: 2 hot chocolates for the kids, my wife had hot tea and I had a French press coffee. We all ordered twice baked croissants and we all really enjoyed.  The service was very good and we had a question once seated for a staff member.  It was her first day and she had an awesome personality...very pleasant.  She explained she was new but she would do her best to help us (can't remember her question). As a local business owner, I would hope my employees represent my company in a similar fashion.  

Most importantly, as a response to my first review, I received a note from Stefanie who expressed regret for my experience and offered to buy me a croissant and coffee.  Unexpected but the way a complaint should be handled.  Thanks Stefanie! (I responded back, but not sure you received as I was having technology issues that day!)"}
{"text":"The best place to go if you're looking for a place to relax and not feel guilty about stuffing your face with baked goods sent from heaven. My go to is always the eclairs - whether you get chocolate, vanilla, or caramel, there are no misses! But. I tried the infamous salted caramel brownies last night for the first time - and they definitely live up to the hype. There's more to this bakery than meets the eye - no seriously, I couldn't believe how big the place was - and no matter what you order, you'll leave happy!"}
{"text":"Look, I don't want to hate on Amelie's. There have been plenty of nights where I couldn't wait to get my hands on a caramel salted brownie. They're always there when you need them. Quite literally, because Amelie's never closes. It's open 24/7. If there were anything they do really well, that would be it. I have to say, however, that the quality has gone down. When I go nowadays, I'm not surprised when I get a not-so-fresh or burned eclair. It's par for the Amelie's course. And then there are all of the hipsters. You'll need to scour the premises for somewhere to sit because these guys have taken up every seat in the place. Can be a little annoying when you just need somewhere to park it for 10 mins. But no, you must inhale your baked good and coffee and then move on with life.  

They have coffee, tea, sandwiches, soups, and plenty of sweets. If you get a craving around 6pm, wait 5 hours and then go to Amelie's - less people to fight through for mediocre pastries."}
{"text":"Liked that they're open 24/7 in this sleepy city. 

I went with a basic Croissant and iced coffee. Trying to keep it simple and guage them on the basics. I guess NYC spoiled me because if that's what passes for a great Croissant down here... then I feel sorry for the patrons here. It was tasteless, dry, and brittle. It was as dry as if the Sahara fuc*ed the Gobi and this Croissant was the offspring. 

The iced coffee required a diabetes inducing amount of sugar to take the edge off of the too bitter 

Also note that the young wanna be hipsters here are keen to solely occupy and spread out on the comfortable interior  tables that can house many people. This forces people out of the well decorated interior into a long noisy corridor where you get to sit on metal chairs and listen to the  worst music human ears should endure. 

Maybe they do other things well but I won't be eager to come back."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a great bakery. I enjoy their pastries. The ambiance is good. There is ample space to sit down without being crowded or feeling rushed to leave. I also like that Amelie's is open 24 hours.

Amelie's coffee is just OK. They also serve it in small sizes. You cannot order a large cup which most people are accustomed to (e.g. 20 ounces)."}
{"text":"I come here every so often just to see maybe the pastries or coffee has gotten better. I tried a caramel sea salt latte (something like that) and it tasted like it was burnt. There was a long line there and I didn't have time to wait to get my latte remade. Today I tried another drink, the barista didn't say hi or even smile. It seemed like it was a huge inconvenience to him to make me the blackberry iced drink. I don't think I will be returning. I am really dissapointed in this place."}
{"text":"Eat here twice during my stay. Relaxed environment, lots places to eat. Great food the tartines, salad and sweets all amazing. Staff super friendly and prices reasonable.  Great place to sit eat and watch all the people pass by."}
{"text":"It's the best place to go late night in Charlotte. My friends and I have been here probably a billion times. The coffees are amazing. The tarts, cakes, and macaroons are delicious. Try the french soda and also the ginger beer."}
{"text":"I love Amelies!!!!  Great atmosphere- OPEN 24 hrs!   So hard to find in Charlotte.  Decor changing all the time, so fun and girly.  Great spot to reserve for a shower or party!  Best fresh pastries, dilworth Coffey and yummy small sandwiches.  Definitely chick food, but the breakfast sandwiches are pretty hardy, and so delicious!  Very close to perfect!"}
{"text":"I dig hanging out here. I am a fan of anything open all hours of the day. When you walk into Amelie's there is a homely feeling that makes me want to order half of the pastries from the case and post up in the living room (a personal fave chill spot) forever. I work here on occasion when the office walks start to wear on me. It's also a super good late night hang out after a show at the Evening Muse. A neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Latte and hot chocolate is better than Starbucks. And definitely try salted caramel brownies."}
{"text":"I love this new Amelie's location. They have a good sized bar (with beer and wine) and plenty of seating. If you decide to stay for drinks, our bartender offered to let us skip the line and get our éclair for us (nice!). Which, by the way, was delicious! Everything I saw go by looked so good, it's really hard not to order it all. 

I'm glad this part of Uptown is growing and that we have a great option for drinks/dessert! Yes, I'm going back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Such a sweet bakery. Decor inside is beautiful. Never had a bad experience, but I will say sometimes it can be hard to find a seat. Overall amazing food. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"The Dilworth area is really lacking in places that have good to-go breakfast sandwich options.  Believe me, I've tried a bunch of places and have concluded that Bojangles' is the clear winner.  Sad.

And then Amelie's showed up in the back lot of Park Road Shopping Center.  My first thought was \"Ok let's give this place a shot.\"  I walked in and saw a typical Amelie's decor...mismatched furniture, blue walls comfortable seating.  This location was a bit different, with the wide open space and a nice looking bar next to the coffee machines.  Perfect spot to sit if you're just hanging out by yourself.  The staff is always walking around cleaning and checking in on people, so it's nice to see a place where the employees care.

I saw a breakfast sandwich on the menu...great, we're on the right track!  The menu is simple...start with an egg, pick a bread, choose a protein and select a cheese.  I'm a big ham/egg/cheese sandwich on a croissant sandwich kind of girl, so that's what I got.  Croissant was a little greasy, but the sandwich was great!  Real egg that was freshly cooked with a good portion of warm ham.  YUM!!!

I'm so happy I found my new go-to, to-go breakfast sandwich place.  Not only do I have another great dessert place to pick up some sweets for friends, but I have a place to treat myself on a weekend morning!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, the locations in Noda & Rock Hill are my favorite."}
{"text":"I don't think I can exaggerate how bad ass this charming little cafe is. Not only are they open 24/7 but their food is amazing. Brie + turkey + bacon = legendary. We came in at 230am after hitting up various bars around downtown and we ran into a fun little crowd. For being open that late, the workers also seemed to be pretty fun. I'll have to make the trek down to enjoy this place again."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Loved the atmosphere and the service! Shout out to Billy for helping me on my first visit. Will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Terrible visit; I will not be back. We ordered several items, and 3 drinks. I received 2 drinks, went to our table and my spouse asked where their drink was. I went back to the bar and basically got called a liar. I went off, because I will not be called a liar. They did not provide me a receipt when I paid, and said that was the reason. I do not care. They finally made the drink just to get me to shut up. Glad for that. 20 minutes after consuming my creme brûlée, I had dysentery. I'm am furious. I will never go back; I will discourage other people from going. That was absolutely unacceptable. If I could give a rating less than one, you bet your butt I would put a rating lesson one. You can't just play around with crème brûlée, being a raw egg product, you have to make sure that your stuff is super fresh you're going to kill somebody. Absolutely livid. I have not been off the toilet since my visit. And I visited about four hours ago."}
{"text":"The baguettes are good and they'll have a food item or 2 I can eat. The drinks and coffee are nice plus they stay open 24/7. When I say 24/7, like remember the snow storm the last couple of years, well d@mn it, they were open. 
They should get 5 stars just for that!"}
{"text":"Constantly disappointed with this location... Staff is borderline rude, place is always dirty. Love the fruit tarts in noda, stopped in here to give it another try. Told the lady the ones on the top looked old and that i wanted a fresh one. She said ok no problem, and gave me an OLD ONE(they had fresh on the bottom). the berries were hard, the whole thing was stale. I mentioned it and no one cared at all. $5!!! For a stale pastry!! Bar cocoa down the street or even panera bread is better than this location. Avoid."}
{"text":"The croissants were super flaky and delicious, felt like we were in France! Very cool atmosphere inside and the place was hugeee! Had a very nice selection of pastries as well definitely will have to give them a try next time!"}
{"text":"I always come to Amelie's whenever I'm in town or whenever I meet up to catch up with someone. The aroma and ambience of the cafe are great and accommodate the food so well. I love the chai latte and the turkey sandwich on baguette bread. I've also tried a variety of their pastries and have yet to be disappointed! Amelie's is a must when coming to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Expensive. Good, but $6 for a egg and 1 strip of (very thin) bacon sandwich? Might was well go to McDonald's or Jack in the Box to get a good breakfast at a better price. Could have gotten similar at fast food, with a drink and saved $2."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery for breakfast, lunch, meetings, studying, or late night snacks.  You have to pass the bakery section to order food, and there is no way you won't order one of their sweet treats for dessert! They also have a variety of coffee and tea options that are made to order.  The ambiance is very hipster with a variety of tables to sit at- near the bakery, near a fire place, etc. and each has a different feel and different decorations. It's nice and quiet, but lively at the same time."}
{"text":"I regret not trying every pastry they offered. I just didn't have enough time. I ate here 5 times at least in 2 weeks. They were so yummy no matter what time we arrived. Man I regret not trying every chocolate and pastry they offered."}
{"text":"I like this location in the backlot of Park Road Shopping Center. It's very spacious, cheerful and clean. Friendly, helpful service and quick, too!  In the last week I've had the pull-apart cinnamon bread (to die for) and the asparagus quiche. Decent savory options for vegetarians, and of course, all the sweet goodies you can imagine.  My guests have been gluten-free types and have found good gluten free options as well. I will surely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, fun, delicious food: perfect place for kids.  They have lots of seating, including wing backs and couches so very comfortable.  You can see bakers through glass cooking pastries, LOVED this place!"}
{"text":"The ONLY place in Charlotte to get a decent French pastry--seriously!! Chocolate eclairs (chocolate and vanilla custard options) are phenomenal.  Salted caramel brownie--you will not want to share it!  Great ambience with plenty of cute little seating areas to study or just hang with your buds.  This is a place not to be missed.  Haven't had serious food there yet, but I hear that is great too. Huge selection so you will need to stop back several times to try everything in the case."}
{"text":"Okay - so let me first say that I actually agree with some of the things said in the 2 star reviews - I've had some servers at the counter who were either a bit rude or made me feel rushed - kinda like if I wasn't ready to decide, why was I standing there - can't speak for the cakes/sweets/pastries - I do know good baguette when I have it, and they do - they also have a good croissant -my favorite is the sandwich au jambon - the croque moinseur is also decent - yes it is trendy, especially compared to 1-1.5 years ago - it used to not be so crowded - but for the things they have that I like, I still think it's pretty good. I think I might try one of the soups next time in."}
{"text":"I happen to live the the neighborhood of the NoDa location, its bitter sweet, literally! I love their food but its not something I can eat all the time, a girl needs to protect her figure! Love the french press coffee, love the breakfast sandwiches. They came into my office for a catering demo and it was fantastic. Also love that the location by me is 24hrs, seriously, great for students and those that want to wake up early or read late at night. Customer service is great, location is comfy and relaxed. It one of my favs."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to hang out and chill with you friends in middle of the night. As I stated in my review earlier, a friend of mine flew in from Philly so I called up all our college friends and we had our boyz night out. 

After done at the EpiCentre around 2am, I decided to check out Amelie's since I was hearing so many good things about it here on Yelp. Also, we had to get buzz off before get home otherwise my friends would get in trouble ;)

We arrived at the bakery and I see mid 20s college kids hanging outside on a patio. Oh that reminded all our good old days but let's not go there!

We walked in and all I see is the greatest evil man kind ever made which is undesirable tasty so that we go back for more. I couldn't figure out what I should get and what I should skip so I ordered Chocolate Croissants, apple/peach/pear tarts and chocolate creme brulee. All I can say is, I was worried about what I am about to do to myself or my diet but I felt satisfied!

While having our satisfying desert, I couldn't stop thinking abt the decor and one of my friend mention that it's all made out of junk/vintage items. So I said, it doesn't matter as long as the presentation is perfect :)"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? I enjoyed some great coffee and some pretty good macarons really late on a weeknight. They are pretty mediocre as far as macarons are concerned, but they hit the spot. There was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it. Even at the off time, it was hard to find a seat. They definitely need more seating. 

This is a great place for people watching."}
{"text":"I've been in twice for breakfast... the Croissant breakfast sandwiches are wonderful... choose 3 items to go in ... Sausage, scrambled egg and spring mix greens for me.  The coffee is from an excellent Charlotte-area roaster who does it right.  

I got a box of mixed macarons as a gift... they were quite tasty!

They have some service issues, but I'm betting that will settle out as they employees settle in to the new joint.

EDIT:  I've gone back several times and their service has smoothed out a bit now that they have had some time to smooth out the rough edges.  5-stars.

The Croissant breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites and the coffee is really something special (probably in my top 2-3 Charlotte cups).  The pecan tarts and anything with fresh fruit on top are stellar."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite cafe to get dessert.  I get a different macaroon each time I come.  This time is the Mango Saffron and the Berry.  My husband got the Peach tart and the salted caramel torte for later.  I come everytime we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cozy, eclectic environment perfect to study in. My favorite pastries are the strawberry tarte, palmiers, and vanilla macarons. The pastries are expensive which is my only complaint but I keep going back so it must be worth it!"}
{"text":"My favorites are the raspberry tarts, pistachio macaroons, and their pumpkin pies when they are available.  They have a wide selection or desserts and pastries and can satisfy any sweet tooth.  95% of the time at night, there is always a huge line of people.  It goes semi quickly but the line also is butt up against a few tables and that is always awkward for me.  I don't like people standing on top of me when I am out to eat and I don't want to do it either.  Other than that, everything is good there."}
{"text":"My first visit was yeaarrss ago, but I remember it being so good that I made it a request to my cousins to take me there again on my last trip to Charlotte. At first I wasn't that hungry, but there are so many deliciously looking treats in the case that I ended up getting much more than what I originally planned: 6 macarons, chocolate mousse cup, chocolate cake, and fruity black tea. The tea was so yummy! Actually, everything was yummy! I shared all those sweets, though, of course. 

The chocolate mousse cup is definitely for chocolate lovers. The cup itself is made of chocolate. Very rich! The chocolate cake is on the lighter chocolate side and fluffy. I liked that the macarons were a good size, not like other places whose are so small that it isn't worth it. Each seemed true to flavor, and the cookie part was just right, not crunchy but not too chewy either.

I hear Amelie's is opening more and more locations, and my sister even got lucky with one in her home city of Atlanta. Now if only it would keep moving more and more south to Florida!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place.

PROS:
- decor... omg soooo cute!!!! Very eclectic and French-inspired. Always something new to look at. Check out their French word of the day.

CONS:
- everything I've tried, from coffee to pastries, has been average
- busy all the time. Good luck finding a chair!"}
{"text":"I love that there is a new location in Carmel Commons. I have to admit that I love the NoDa one a tad bit more than this one but at least I can go and get these goodies when I'm on the other side of Charlotte without having to plan a cross country trip across the state of Mecklenburg. The treats are just amazing and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Just left this shrine to awesome with peach tarts, salted caramel brownies, layered tortes, Napoleon, and zero thoughts given to my diet for today. I completely agree that this bakery is temptation made visceral. Love love love it! I'm going back for macaroons and creme brûlée next. There was a good length line but they move it really well. I was in and out (take out) in less than 15 mins. Excellent prices, affordable to get an array of things to try and stay under $20. I love NoDa!"}
{"text":"Convenient location near Southpark Mall but not the same cool atmosphere as the NODA location.  Same desserts but I think this location has some different items like the walnut tart unless it was a newbee of the season.  It was really good.  There's outside seating just before walking in.  Pretty landscaping, windows, and a high rise sitting area."}
{"text":"Highly rated bakery in town so I had to bookmark it.  Dropped in with my mom and saw a lot of students inside.  Not too bad as I consider myself to be close in age.  So it would be nice as a social spot but many choose to study or chat here.  Friendly & helpful staff.  Most desserts have the right amount of sweetness and some could be a little more sweeter.  There's a lot to choose from.  My favs are the tarts and lavender macaroons.  I liked the chocolate brownie coffee and chai creme.  I can't believe it's open 24/7.  I'd like to come at midnight and see how cool it would be.  I may try a deli sandwich next time or bruschetta.  Expect to pay $10 2/3 items or $15 if you pick 4 items (desserts & drink) if it's your first time.  I usually get one drink and one dessert so it's about $7.  Bring a love lock  which was an ongoing tradition at one time in Paris.  Read on it."}
{"text":"They have one of the best eclairs in town! This place is a must go for people who drinks coffee at night because they open 24/7! Do try the mini mousses! They are the bomb!!"}
{"text":"I honestly think this place is a bit overhyped. There was a line of over 20 people at 9pm on a Friday. I tried the macarons, the salted caramel brownie, and a small strawberry topped cake. I was disappointed to find that the food looked better than it actually tasted. The macarons were okay but tasted stale. They probably taste better when they have a fresh batch ready but it appears that they restock items from a freezer or fridge in the back. The salted caramel brownie was really flat and small portioned. It was also rather hard from being refrigerated. I prefer brownies warm and soft. The strawberry cake was decent but also cold and hard."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Macaroons are to die for!! Should have gotten some to go! The line can be really long on Friday and Sat nights but it moves fairly quickly, so don't let it detour you. Lots of seating because the place is massive. Think old warehouse decorated into French Cafe. 

Food is fresh and always delicious! Service is good with a smile!"}
{"text":"Noel was great! Really great attitude!  Spoke with her on the phone before arriving and she was just as nice in person. Came specifically to this location for the flavor of bread pudding that day. Noel took my order and proceed to work on my computer. Bread pudding arrives and it's the wrong flavor. Took it back to the counter and she apologized and put another in the over for me. No biggie. But 40 mins go by and the correct bread pudding came. Go back and Noel says the kitchen forgot and it's burnt. Again she was very polite, put yet another in the oven and offered to bag one for the rode. 30 more mins pass, and the warm bread pudding never comes. Finally I gave up and took my cold bread pudding and made it at home. If it weren't for the staff's great attitude, this entire trip would've been a bust"}
{"text":"Only been a couple of times in the last year. The place has a wonderful atmosphere, but many of the baked goods are not made from scratch. The feel is very authentic and the staff has been nothing but stellar. The coffee is SPOT ON, but the frozen tarts and cinnamon buns just kind of take off points for me."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying I love Amelies.  It's a treat when I get to go, but Sunday night at around 2:30 a.m. was different. My husband and I ordered 5 different pastries for us and our children and 2 sandwiches.  We waited a while for our sandwhiches...no big deal. Then we see a man take our sandwiches to the wrong person and get upset. I tried to tell him they were ours but he brushed passed me ignoring me. It was obvious he was upset. He threw our food down behind the counter and started angrily throwing them into to go boxes. I had a side salad and he slammed it around until half the salad fell out of the bowl. Another lady had to remake the salad.  My husband yelled at him to stop being so rough with our food but he ignored my husband. He tried to give our food away again to the same guy but then calmed down enough to hear it was ours. He was like \"I'm sorry man\".  I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  I also drive for Uber and recommend Amelies to numerous out of town guests. I probably won't anymore if they risk being treated that way. No matter how successful a business is, they should always treat their customers with more respect."}
{"text":"They are open 24/7 365! I Be prepared though, there will most likely be a line but wait isn't unbearable. The seating can be a pain, and the decor is very trendy.  The salted caramel brownies are known as their staple item which were very good!  I also had a great white chocolate latte I can't wait to go back and try more stuff.  It is a little overwhelming trying to order as their is a tons of different deserts staring at you so be prepared to rack your brain!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and deserts. Long line and wait. However food was worth the wait. So many deserts to choose from and fresh. Limited seating and space. Artsy atmosphere in the Noda area."}
{"text":"It is an absolutely fantastic bakery. The food and variety is unquestionable. However, good luck getting a seat here and you will wait for at least 15 minutes in line during almost any time of the day. It is worth the wait though!

Bakery should start putting a policy that if you want to seat here, you'll have to be eating/drinking something. People come over with their books and laptops and stay at the tables forever. This is not Starbucks! Perhaps they will make that change some day and then everyone will be able to enjoy a nice afternoon coffee/tea with pastry!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. It was one of the first places my friend took me when I moved to Charlotte. I've been to the Pineville and Rock Hill locations as well, but this is one of my favorites. Such a unique and creative vibe."}
{"text":"Salted Caramel Brownies and French Macaroons :)...They are a bit pricey...hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"The iced coffee was great and so was my brie and turkey sandwich! The pastries and desserts were incredibly tasty as well, not to mention great to look at. It was hard to pick what I wanted!

The interior is really neat - it goes farther back than you would expect. It definitely gives that very friendly atmosphere when you walk in."}
{"text":"Kept hoping their pastries would get better but it's only getting staler, smaller and less impressive for the money.  Sooooo sad about it too, because we used to LOVE the uptown location."}
{"text":"Hazelnut praline coffee, espresso gateau and salted carsmel brownie!
Really like the salted caramel brownie! The espresso cake is good but would be better if there is less cream. Pretty good service and casual environment to do work and hang out!"}
{"text":"This active bakery receives lots of hype and plenty of business. We did not eat a meal there, so my review is limited to the pastry.  Overall, the bakery items are attractive and well prepared. We were definitely not blown away, however, and felt the pastries were overpriced. We are used to DC prices and quality, so paying a substantial price for quality food items is acceptable to us, but Amelie's just didn't measure up, for us."}
{"text":"Amelies.  Love it.  Great food and the staff is wonderful.  Their cakes are a little expensive.  I wanted to get one to feed 20 people and it was over $100.  Other than that, I really like the place."}
{"text":"The pastries and coffee are great, which is a shame because we will not return. We arrived about 25 minutes before closing and a sweet woman (with glasses) assisted us. We moved through the line very quickly and still had plenty of time to enjoy the small handful of items we purchased. They packed the pastries up in to-go boxes, so I kindly asked for a few plates. Another \"girl\" (as I will refer to her as due to her lack of maturity) was very short with me as she simply told me no. I asked why they could not give us a few plates since I saw them sitting right on top of the counter. She said it was too much work for them to clean them since they were closing soon. Really - 4 plates? Then she began to opening talk about my family & I with a few other employees. Two ladies came in right at closing and were turned away in a rather rude manner. We had a chat with them on their way out and they were in disbelief since the door was open and it was closing time on the nose. I believe this \"girl\" may have be the manager. Owner beware - this is how your employees act when you are not present. You will continue to lose customers if not addressed."}
{"text":"If you are in the neighborhood and like sweet food, this is a must try. Actually even if you don't like sweet food you gotta stop by. 
The pastries are so soft, yummy and fresh. The atmosphere is unique and people are humble and polite. 
If I'm in Charlotte again, I'm definitely stopping by even if I don't have time."}
{"text":"Sweet, sweet Amelie's.  This is a great place to go when you don't know what you want for dessert.  The hours are awesome (11PM pastry run, anyone?) and the pastry case is beautiful.  We really love their cream puffs and salted caramel brownies.  So far, we haven't eaten anything that's sicky-sweet.  Their little bite-sized tarts are delicious and they offer a variety.  The macarons are pretty (around eight options) but I really haven't found a macaron I adore (here or anywhere).  We've never done it, but this looks like a cozy spot to sit and read with a coffee and dessert...check out the back room - you'll be impressed with how big and colorful it is."}
{"text":"Funky. Fun. Yummy!
Atmosphere- This is what makes the place so so cool! The atmosphere is funky Victorian and huge! No tiny corner store like expected!

Service- The menu seems a little hard to maneuver and so I believe it would be nice if we got a little more guidance. Tip- No matter what line you order from you can order pastries, bistro and drinks, no I wasn't told that, I gathered that after stupidly ordering twice. Oh well! Live and learn I suppose! Overall, nice staff!

Food/Drinks- I will touch on the beverages as I have yet to try their pastries! I had the best Fall drink! Like Fall in a cup here guys! It was the Salted Caramel Apple Cider! Yum! Must try! I think it may be only seasonal (which I really hope not!) but go and try!

Overall, a must try place! Obviously a place that is iconic to Charlotte and for good reason :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes the line is crazy long, and sometimes just the wait to get your sandwich is really long. food is worth it though. and its awesome that it's 4 hours. but there is usually always a long wait."}
{"text":"Second chance and disappointed a second time. My cream puff tasted like it was frozen then thawed. I guess the rumors were correct in saying that Amelie's freezes a lot of their baked goods. If I wanted frozen I would have went to Costco! Heading to Dillworth to Sweet Lorraine's, where everything is fresh. Amelies, is not worth the wait in line. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have a sweet tooth that doesn't really need satisfying all that often.  I just recently was turned on to this jewel of a bakery a few weeks ago.  Now, it's like a little voice in the back of my head if I'm out....\"hmm....a little something sweet from Amelie's would hit the spot\".  

Never had anything there that didn't nearly make my eyes roll into the back of my head.  It's all good to me....seriously.  I've never been to the Uptown location so I can't compare but I love the eclectic nature of this joint.  Very cool and the vibe is just chill and laid back.  Fits me perfect.

The whole NoDa area is great and this place compliments it very well.  

In short, I have created an affair with Amelie's that is surely something sinful yet satisfying and one to last a very long time I can tell :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Very European (as I am told). Very laid back, friendly, artsy, community driven place.

No worries if you are counting calories! They have elegant bite sized treats that won't wreck the count, so enjoy. 

I often enjoy a pastry and coffee when I visit. My average length of stay is 3 hours. I'm either working , meeting friends, reading or writing."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's once my home for studying and lounging w friends for the past 6 years. Lately though the customer service has been in decline. Not as friendly as it once use to be. The desserts have also been off their game. I've notice this gradual change for a while but tonight has pushed me to right a review cause of the service of the male cashier. 1st and last impression are the most important. If there's no quiche than say \"oh sorry but we don't have any tonight\" not \"we don't have quiche\". Its takes just a lil bit of effort but can make the biggest difference. Don't be stingy w words. If I'm bothering as a customer than maybe this isn't the right job for you. Love the place, just pick better employees"}
{"text":"Lovely pastry and real food.  Enjoy the mushroom sandwich.  Daily soup options which are delish!!!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"I go to a convention every year right down the street from this restaurant...and it is fantastic. The bread is made in house and is crusty and delicious. Their coffee is some of the best coffee I have ever had. Maybe I was just swept in the excitement of the convention, but it was fantastic. 
One negative...tiny coffee cups. I drink a lot of coffee and I felt like ordering 4 of the tiny cups and dumping them into a large mug. Size aside, the coffee was magical.
Now, baked goods. I had two tarts while I was there and they were both fantastic. The macaroons were incredible. They had multiple flavors including a balsamic berry that was just this side of transcendent. 
And the sandwiches. I had a Croque Monsiour which was tasty, (I really wish they had the Croque Madame, because eggs make everything better.), the Croissant Pour Deux (small croissants layered with fig preserves, prosciutto and goat cheese), and the Seeded Roast Beef. All of their food was fantastic. We chose to keep going there rather than the expensive Brazilian Steak House down the street because their food was so spot on.
I totally recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so fun!!!  My favorite part is that they have gluten free items that are so yummy!!!  Coffee and tea are as good as the pastries. Atmosphere is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. This has become the go to place for birthday office lunches. It's fast, the food is amazing and not just the pastries and the service is awesome and these ladies don't even work off tips. Just a great place so happy to have location so close by .. Great job"}
{"text":"Great spot for coffee and I recommend the turkey bacon sandwich on a croissant for lunch.

2¢ is if its your first time you will most likely be confused or see someone confused by how they form the lines to order which are 1/2 cafeteria style lines 1/2 TSA"}
{"text":"There is a taste for everyone here from sweets to savory. They have an above par hot coffee or else would recommend giving the Chai Creme a taste, have been hooked it for weeks now and I am super impressed with the consistency from the baristas no kidding. Next up for lunch I have also been hooked on the turkey BLT served on a croissant and comes with a cup of soup.For the soups the asparagus leak is always good but haven't had a bad soup out of the rotating ones either.

2¢- if you're new to chai then then chai creme is where you need to start"}
{"text":"Very nice Bakery beautiful display of fresh product which changes daily fantastic croissant and macaroon depending on what you order it can be a little pricey but the quality is definitely there I can't say I was disappointed  with anything we've gotten there"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bakeries in Charlotte w/ their cute, inviting, kitchy atmosphere. The lavender lemonade is a must try. Also the chocolate mousse, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"It took me a while to get over to Amelie's, which was recommended by a friend, but since my first visit a couple of weeks ago, I've taken five different people in to show them the awesome, and it's a difficult thing to keep myself from going back there every day.  The fresh fruit and cheese danishes are possibly the best danish I've ever had in my life, whatever time of day I happen to eat one...in the morning, in the evening, whatever.  I've tried a couple of the sandwiches -- the seeded roast beef is particularly good, but the pate with cornichons is also none too shabby.  I bought some gluten-free baked treats for a friend of mine who suffers from that tragic non-bread-eating disability, and she loved them, which makes me really appreciate that Amelie's cares enough to provide some options for everyone.   And the decor is awesome, and it's not too far a stretch to imagine just hanging out there all the time, although I wouldn't want to contribute to the scarcity of tables.  Everything's a little spendy compared to some of the other bakeries around, but it is actually that much better, so there you go."}
{"text":"Loved this dessert spot!!! Macarons were fresh and all the flavors were unique and tasty. Saffron and pistachio were by far the best. 

The inside was very big (much bigger than expected) with very cute decor. Includes a bakery, wine/beer bar, cappuccino/coffee bar, as well as plenty of tables for sitting. Loved it and would definitely return to any of the 6 locations!!"}
{"text":"Is really like this place, it's always packed so
It's hard to find a parking spot and the lines are very long, however their salted caramel coffee is the bomb, the decor is very unique and the vibe is amazing. It's a very good option because they're open 24 hours, it's a little pricey but worth it. I didn't like the macaroons I tried them in different occasions and never like them, the tarts are very good though. It's a nice place to
Go with friends to sit down and enjoy some coffee and deserts, definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Thank God for this place. My wife and I moved to Charlotte from Chicago and sorely miss the awesome late-night bakery scene - taking a visit to Amelie's most certainly helps!  Their coffee is excellent, sourced from a roaster spun-off from Dilworth Coffee and prepared masterfully by their baristas.  I've had their drip and their European Latte, both of which were superb.  Their bakery offerings are top-notch as well.  We have had a number of their goodies, but none stand out as much as the macaroons - those things are outstanding!  I recommend the Pistachio and Cinnamon-Chocolatey ones above the rest.  The sitting area is large, uniquely decorated, and inviting.  Despite massive crowds, I have never had issues finding a place to set up shop (a word to the wise - around back you can take advantage of seating in the shared atrium, which is key when they are busy)."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast sandwiches, ok lunch sandwiches, and their pecan tart is amazing. Best of all, they have a pretty efficient system and you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Lots of variety in pastries which was nice. Too sweet for my taste though - the fruit tart and chocolate croissant were my favorite. Would I go back? Sure if I was seriously craving something super sweet and if it was convenient but otherwise, no. Nothing out of the ordinary. Nice cafe to sit and do work though."}
{"text":"I don't see all the hype about this place. They have a few things that are good and a lot if bland items after that. One of the only late night restaurants open. I've given up ordering tea lattes here because they water down the milk and justify it by saying the tea will not steep in milk.....What?"}
{"text":"I love the selection of amazing pastries and goodies they offer. It's always consistent and always yummy!"}
{"text":"Amelie's may possibly be the perfect place. I have definitely lain awake at night dreaming of their turkey, brie, and cranberry compote baguette sandwich. And, as my first review said, I have also driven 20 minutes across town for a pecan sticky bun at all hours of the night. I consider it to be an accomplishment if I can drive past Amelie's without going in- an accomplishment I have not achieved very often. 

Everyone mentions the salted caramel brownie, and it is to die for. However, it's not my favorite- simply because I think it's impossible to pick a favorite. I dare you to eat an eclair without emitting uncontrollable sounds of happiness. The cream cheese muffins, filled croissants, and tartines have also padded my stomach a few times. 

The service is always quick and efficient, which is saying something considering how long the line always is. I am always well taken care of by efficient and courteous staff, that have personalities and don't just stare at the counter while they ring you up. 

If I lived closer, I would never leave."}
{"text":"I was charged $8 for a bacon, egg white, Brie croissant! That's way more than the same thing at the Noda location.  And it was a hot, sloppy mess of a sandwich.  I'll be sticking to the Noda locations in the future and suggest the same for everyone.  So sad, because the location & decorations are beautiful."}
{"text":"I have an insane sweet tooth and on a recent trip to North Carolina was told that this place was not to be missed! I was surprised at how it was open 24 hours and also the line and overall size of the place! It was huge inside and many people were just hanging out even at 10 at night. People were eating, doing work and just lounging throughout the entire place. 

The line moved quickly and I ended up with a salted Carmel brownie, which was very tasty. The only thing that was just a tad bit disappointing is that there wasn't much selection when I was there. It seemed that they were in the midst of changing out their display. 

I appreciated when the cashier also told us about the free water cups instead of immediately charging us for a bottle of water. Overall, the brownie was very good and the small raspberry cup was delicious as well. The prices were reasonable and the entire dining area/lounge rooms were very clean."}
{"text":"I think this review is going to be along the same lines as everyone else. I was hankering for some sweets late at night, ok it wasn't that late, maybe 8 or so, and I looked for some dessert spots. Turns out we weren't too far from Amélie's French Bakery.

I hate parking so I looked them up on Google Maps before heading out and saw they had a parking lot right in front so I figured it wouldn't be too bad and I was right, we found a spot right away. 

The line was long. It did wrap around and through 2 rooms. It also moved fast. I timed it, because why not? It took 25 minutes from walking in to walking out. That's not bad at all. I got to hear a lovely (not) conversation behind me, so it was interesting to say the least. The space is super cute and cozy, though we got ours to go. I can see why people would like to come here and work or hang out with friends. 

We ordered a variety of desserts. Lemon & raspberry meringue; salted caramel & espresso torts; salted caramel brownie; 2 macaroons; 2 chocolate croissants for the following morning. The best thing was the Lemon & Raspberry meringue. The worst things were the macaroons. The torts were excellent and the salted caramel brownie was just okay. The croissants were pretty good though. 

I think I am biased though. My heritage is French and my mom is an excellent baker, so things first get judged by how my mom makes them and secondly by a place in my hometown that made a croquembouche for my wedding, who is directly from France. His macaroons are the best things I've ever had. I think my expectations were too high for a place that is always packed and is open 24hrs. I think their quality suffers because of the quantity they need to produce to keep up with demand.  It did however meet the \"late night desserts\" urge that I had!"}
{"text":"Pastries and amazing coffee, Yes Please!  It's a bit of a wait but I have become accustomed to if its worth it you will wait."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a egg, cheddar cheese, spinach and tomato baguette!"}
{"text":"Yummy place with great vibe and great food. It was so close to my hotel that I ate there twice while I was visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible. There is the weirdest array of pimple-laden incels you have ever seen gathered in one location. I only mention this because it affects their disposition and attitude towards customers. They are unfriendly, insular, rude, and do not seem clean. This is my opinion and observation after having visited this place over 15 times."}
{"text":"Firstly, I enjoy occasional trip to Amélie's NoDa location, when I can get in. Their new Pineville location still produces quality bakery goods but the eclectic atmosphere fails to make the grade. Beat up tables, etc., OK but dark and dank with kids running around uncontrolled whilst their mothers chit chat does not a nice morning make."}
{"text":"I am a Pastry Arts Major, so I might be more critical than an average customer. I was overwhelmed when I first arrived to Charlotte and I loved it, but over the years I have realized the quality of the goods are bit slacking. 

By far, the salted caramel brownie is amazing and is always my go to dessert. It is never bad, never slacking, and always satisfying. Recently I have been exploring some other treats in the display cabinet and I am a bit disappointed. All my non-culinary friends love it, but I can see that some of the products could be amazing. For example the croissants are just not reaching the standard for my liking. 

The employees are amazing, the location is amazing, and the amount of seating is wonderful. Even if you can't find seating in the main building, there is extra seating outside as well as in the atrium in the back. I have been at many different times of the day and always can find a seat. 

I give it 3 stars because I can't get past the quality of the desserts .The food, however, may be the most underestimated part of the restaurant. The soup is to die for, especially the carrot ginger, and the cheese spread are amazing. 

To end I can't forget to mention that it is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. It is an amazing place to visit with a group or by yourself. You must people watch at different parts of the day because the crowd changes depending on what time you are there."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Came here late night with gf, and as a visitor, was surprised to see that we had about 30 people ahead of us in line. However, the decor & spirit of the place gave you that \"don't worry, be happy feeling\". Plus it went extremely fast. If you've never been, it is a must. 

I'm not a coffee drinker, but I just had to try to cafe matteriuer (sp). Goodness - Carmel sauce, sea salt and vanilla bean! Accompanied by the sea salt caramel brownie. Between the coffee and brownie -- my palate was happy. Delectable. They have an assortment of desserts. You will fall in love with the cozy ambiance which is welcoming to Everyone. Good service as well. Open 24/7, who can beat that? I wish you were on the west coast Amelie's."}
{"text":"Hands down the best French bakery I've ever been to.

The atmosphere when you walk in is so inviting! All of the decor seemed to have a hand made touch to it. There is tons of seating and perfect for meetings or even a cool place to study. 

There are several pastry cases full of homemade pastries, croissants, tarts, and baguettes! And by home made I mean they hold make everything! 

Try the pumpkin pie tarts!! Oh and the barista (black guy) SO nice! Definitely made our experience that much better!!

Can't WAIT to go back! :))"}
{"text":"What I like most is that they can make most sandwiches Gluten Free and they have a few gluten free confections to satisfy my sweet tooth. The expanded area makes for more room for writers and cooperative work. Now for a cafe Mocha!"}
{"text":"Amelies is the place to go to enjoy conversation with your buds as well as easy food. My writing sessions always seem to go a bit better when those critiquing are comfortable and fed. Having a cafe mocha or black currant tea doesn't hurt either. I am especially happy that they have gluten free pastries as well as sandwiches (Glutino bread. I checked.) Go and enjoy anytime day or night. Bring a friend. It's better when shared."}
{"text":"I have to admit, being from Seattle I was not confident on finding a cafe in Charlotte that would serve a decent latte, but this particular location made me into a believer!  I've tried their Uptown location a few months ago and I was not impressed.  Clearly the baristas here knew a thing or two (maybe they can train their other locations??) none the less, thoroughly impressed... there's 3 baristas at this location that nail it every time, there is one particular barista who is not consistent ... enough overall a great place"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so unique and definitely a really cool place to go for a meetup, study session or coffee BUT I do have to admit the pastries are so overrated. They are often stale and just not as good as I would expect."}
{"text":"Lines were insanely long, and moving excruciatingly slow.  Employees standing around laughing, while people are waiting.  Put some more on registers or something.   No one offers to help expedite the line.  No telephone orders available.  It's decent, but not worth the wait.  I've been to Paris, but never seen anything as painful as this.  This makes my second visit, and it will be my last at this location.  I'll stick to Pineville."}
{"text":"My coworker told me that Amelie is opened in Pineville Matthew. I am so glad they open one in Pineville because I can go there after work.When I went it was busy but the service was fast. They have the best pastries but is it pricey. I got four pastries for my family and I. I got the chocolate puffs, salted carmel brownie, and chocolate cake. The chocolate puffs were so good. You got to try the chocolate puffs. Amelie, you got to open one in Vegas. Vegas is waiting for you."}
{"text":"This place has such great reviews and I really don't want to put in a bad review but my experience here was beyond horrible. Bought $60 worth of bakery and everything tasted old. Maybe because we came late at night? I'm not sure the reason why but the lines were long and I didn't mind because the atmosphere and decor there was absolutely one of a kind. I wished I could've said the same with their bakery... I would update this bad review when or if I would ever go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food to walk a mile for. Very people friendly reminds me of Greenwich Village. I wish is was closer to where I live in Kannapolis, NC."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable whether its a sandwich, a box full of desserts, 
 or a cheese tray. My personal favorite are the mini crème brulee's, they have seasonal flavors.
I love visiting Amelie's in the middle of the night to people watch, there is such a huge range of people who visit you never know who you might see."}
{"text":"Visited Amelie's the other night.  Hadn't been there in awhile and loved the changes.  Great cozy atmosphere, different levels to sit and a nice bar serving beer and wine.  Much more than just a bakery for sure!"}
{"text":"The pastries of Amelie's are some of the best that I have ever had. It's such a delight to find a cafe in the south that does such a wonderful job of baking French pastries. Hats off to the staff!  The only problem I have at Amelie's is choosing!  The good news is that you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"My only complaint was that I didn't know what to do when I got there.  After realizing that you order your food, find a seat and put a tracker on your table I was good!  The tracker system is really neat.  Bakery items were delicious and my croissant breakfast sandwich was perfectly flaky and cheesy with crispy bacon.  The cafe is also very cool with lots of neat things to look at including windows looking into the bakers working."}
{"text":"I had the strawberry shortcake and my boyfriend got a sandwich and an apple pie--everything was amazing! We got some more to take away with us."}
{"text":"i was very impressed. amazing food. it must help that the owner is french. i love french food and i love this restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place open day and night for your sweet tooth fix!  The food is pretty good here and it is all very \"pretty\".  
I have been about 9 times and always had good quality/tasting food here.  The coffee is not bad either. (wish cups were larger)."}
{"text":"Lunch was incredible - I had the soup du jour and it was light, creamy and super flavorful.  I paired it with a half sandwich of gruyere and jambon - absolutely perfect.  My friend had a tartine which was also divine.  The macaroon we selected to share was a seasonal basil/lime.  I didn't taste the basil at all but the lime was subtle and perfect.  We went after 2:00 p.m. and had to wait a short while to order at counter (only one cashier); took a bit longer than I anticipated as did the wait for food.  Decor is refreshing and charming.  Will definitely be back and would like to try their other locations as well.  Food is worth it."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful space with really great food.  It's perfect for breakfast and lunch, even on-the-go.  There is a ton of seating, and if you're just waiting on a to-go order, you can watch the bakers preparing the pastries.  It was a little long of a wait for a to-go order for two sandwiches, but the sandwiches were good and the fruit was fresh.  I had the croque monsieur, and it was just perfect.  We were just passing through Charlotte, so it's unlikely I'll be there again, but if I ever am in town, I'm definitely stopping by for a meal, or at least some pastries!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, good sandwiches, so-so desserts (be careful, they're not all good), GREAT atmosphere.  Considering Charlotte's lack of good coffee & cappuccino, Amelie's doesn't have to be great to do business as a coffee shop.  It's their Parisian style decor and cafe-esque layout that stands it apart from every coffee shop I've been to in Charlotte and elsewhere :)

It's no wonder this place has been around for years!"}
{"text":"What is not to like in this place ? Too many options for desserts .. Maybe ? 

This place has been our stopover whenever we pass by Charlotte. They serve a variety of pastries especially the sweet ones :). Their salted caramel sweet pastries can be trusted at all times to surprise you. It is difficult to get the right balance between the level of saltiness and sweetness. I think they have perfected it. Their other pastries are definitely worth a bite. 

Again, don't blame yourself for being confused and  undecided. Their addendum to coffee are interesting. Give the spicy mocha a shot :)

Bottom line: Absolutely French & Wonderfully delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite spots to hang out at and enjoy their delicious coffee, pastries and all around decor. All the staff are pretty cool and super nice manager. I come here almost once a week. Don't let the 3.5 star rating for this place fool you."}
{"text":"Great pastries and good service."}
{"text":"Great food and a really cute atmosphere. A great place for a date and the NoDa location is open 365, 24/7. It can get really crowded, but that comes with places that have good food."}
{"text":"Amelies is a Charlotte staple! Everyone that lives or visits Charlotte MUST try it at least once. Though I warn you, one visit will most certainly turn into more. This French bakery has the most amazing desserts and coffee on the planet. I love the French décor and the games and instruments strewn about. The absolute best things are the macaroons. Despite being a tad pricey (they're $2.50 a piece before taxes), they taste like God himself came down from Heaven to whip up a batch of Macaroons. I suggest the Pistachio (my favorite) and the Vanilla Buttercream. As for beverages, I'd suggest the Café Fouette. It's a sweet coffee drink that will make you fall in love with this place. All in all, this place is a home run and a must see if you have friends visiting the area."}
{"text":"Visited after clubbin recently. Really nice staff but I was not impressed with anything my friend or I purchased."}
{"text":"Cool place. Good food. Really bad service.  We've been here 6 - 8 times, and we've never experienced even decent service.  We keep going back, because we really like the atmosphere and the food - but I think we're done giving it more chances.  The employees behind the counter all seem completely miserable to be working there, and attitudes towards customers reflect that.  During our most recent visit, I walked out after standing and waiting at the drink counter for 5 minutes for a drink refill ... and there were 2 people working this area with no other customers.  They were just completely oblivious."}
{"text":"Seriously? Am I really seeing this? I have reached PMS nirvana. This Francophile has found sweet gastronomic heaven. My dear friend/fellow food/shoe/book junkie and I popped our Amelie's cherry(tart) late on Friday night and were pleasantly surprised by the high energy, efficiency of the staff (they kept that line mooooving!), funky decor and sinful eye candy. 

We had ourselves a little sampling and here's the good, the bad and the ugly:

Good: Creme Puffs filled with rich, sweet, thick custard. No wimpy whipped cream here. My toes curled. 

The Salted Caramel Brownie. If I'd been w/anyone other than her, they would've been gotten stabbed in the hand w/my fork had they tried to sample this gooey confection. There is close to 1/4 inch of caramel atop this chewey brownie and the addition of a pinch of salt saves this from being too sweet. 

The Tea Cakes are very moist. The raspberry has a stronger flavor than the lemon.

The line moves quickly. 

The bad: Okay, it really wasn't bad, but my hubby and I tried the Petit Gateau and, while the gnache was rich and smooth (just how I like my men, lol) the cake was actually pretty dry. 

The line moves so fast, you may not have a chance to see all the goodies. I like to weigh my options; calories are precious and I can't waste'em on so-so snacks. 

Lotsa empty trays. No matter how fast they work, they can't keep up w/demand so it seems like we may have missed some good options. 

The Ugly: The near cat-fight over the last eclairs and the creepy mannequin that literally leans over your shoulder as you wait in line. I'm a Leo, I like my space and crazy as it sounds, that thing was giving me the heebies.

Overall, an instant favorite and a reason to haul our tushies down to Charlotte more often."}
{"text":"What a truly unusual place.  In another town you'd see this place and say \"they are trying too hard to be funky/cool.\"  Here in Charlotte I'm here to tell you is the real deal.  They walk the talk and just serve up great baked goods and coffees/teas.  24/7.

Didn't expect to find something so authentic to itself while on a short trip but this is it.  Don't miss it if you come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Amelie's, and I decided it was time to check it out.  This restaurant did it disappoint!   The staff was very friendly, and didn't seem bothered to answer any questions we had based on dietary restrictions.  They also made recommendations on what to eat because everything looked good and we couldn't decide.  My friend and I ordered 1/2 sandwiches and a salad and our food was delicious.  The food tasted very fresh, and was prepared perfectly.  We also decided to get dessert, and once again we were nor disappointed.  We loved the decor of the cafe, and liked that we weren't sitting on top of the tables around us.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Charlotte, Amelie's is a must. If you have a love of the French culture or have taste buds you will find something here that you will love. Mimosa's and pastries for me."}
{"text":"I've been to Amelie's a handful of times, and I'm sad to report I don't like it. I DO love the decor, and I DO love the assortment of desserts and pastries. Here's what I don't like: the place is always crowded and the food and espresso drinks are overpriced.  I paid about $4.50 for a small latte (which costs less than $3 most other places). The woman at the register was in a foul mood and was very short with me when I asked for skim milk. Apparently, they don't have skim milk, only soy.  The latte was not good (I threw it away on my way out the door).  I've had the croque monsieur, which was extremely greasy, and the turkey and brie sandwich wasn't great either.  I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in Charlotte who doesn't like their salted caramel brownies (how can they call that thing a brownie, anyway?!).  About half of the staff members I've interacted with were down-to-earth pleasant individuals, the others were haughty and downright snotty. 50% is not good enough in my book."}
{"text":"Great food! I definitely recommend this establishment. They definitely have great customer service that matches the food."}
{"text":"Great place with some of the best croissants I've had since France.  The cookies are equally as good. 
I haven't had the fruit tarts yet, but they look amazing.
The space is fun and comfortable.  It's an old warehouse building in Noda that has been renovated.  This means I'll be by there everyday on my way to work!  :-)
But seriously, the croissants are super...light, flakey, and you can taste the butter!!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I paid a visit to my favorite bakery in Charlotte to only find out that they are price gauging their long term customers.  It was very noticeable that they were no lines at all on Saturday.  We noticed immediately that the tartlets were marked up over two dollars more than the normal pricing! A simple small cake which is now $5.29.  A tartlet we would normally have for $3.29 is now $5.29.  I think what surprised us the most was the quart of soup that was always $9.99 is now$14.00.  The plates are even smaller to. Even soup and sandwich was marked up $3.00 higher and a much smaller portion of soup. They don't even give you bread with the soup anymore. They even took the water cooler from the back away. Yes, it was very obvious change in management or pure greed !  We asked why the prices soared so high, and her answer was production cost. The soup is the grandma's recipe and it is a simple recipe for the leak soup. Shame on you for taking advantage of your customers.  This is deplorable and disgusting. Your employee looked it at us  straight twice and said production costs. We would normally bring home box of goodies to share with my daughter. This was a very special place for both of us to spend our Saturday afternoon.  We notice how your customers we're not walking out with boxes of goodies. We noticed your lines were very short, actually obsolete.  If you sad to see an ioconic establishment cheap their customers for the almighty dollar.  You definitely lost us as a lifetime customer . Do not go there unless you want to be ripped off!"}
{"text":"My sister and I got the highly recommended Salted Caramel Brownie and the Chocolate Eclair. Both were really next-level delicious! Wish we could have eaten them to stay and enjoyed the atmosphere a little more!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Came to this location before work on a Friday morning, waited on a veggie breakfast sandwich for 30 minutes. When I received my breakfast sandwich, it was the incorrect order with sausage on it. By this time, late to a morning meeting - I notify one of the managers that I must leave as I am now late for work, he assured me he would refund me. Days go by without my refund.. I've called multiple times and talked to multiple \"managers\" who promise my refund and that the primary manager would contact me. Haven't heard anything. I've been to the Noda location an I can attest that this experience is not exemplary of the original location. Don't visit this location - you'll end up -$10 and no breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's every time I go! They never disappoint."}
{"text":"If you follow my reviews, you might know that I am a fan of the Amelie's concept. I'm not too crazy about the uptown location due to poor service. But it's not so much so that I don't occasionally pop in on break from work. Going into the Park Rd location, I figured I'd have a similar experience at the least: maybe the service would lack but the food and coffee were bound to be good.

Luckily, I was right on the latter and wrong in the former. The ladies working the front line were super friendly and helpful. My friend and I became paralyzed with indecision at all the choices. The girls working there made recommendations, joked with us, and generally made me feel welcome. They even pointed out my friend would get a free eclair for his birthday, something I had no idea Amelie's did. 

Sadly, this location is not at all conveniently located to me, especially with the Uptown and NoDa locations. But I occasionally find myself this way and I'm glad to have this as an option for a coffee or afternoon sweet treat."}
{"text":"After a year or so, I'm bummed to report that my experience(s) at the uptown Amelie's have been largely disappointing. My most recent three visits were so dismal that I've decided I likely won't continue spending money at this location. 

A few things that swayed my opinion: rude staff, multiple incorrect orders, suspiciously long wait times, all out anarchy at the cashier lines and seemingly no interest in helping from the staff, declining quality of food, and, all this considered, overly priced products. 

I wish I could pin point the difference here and figure out a way to deal with it. This location is ideal in that it's walking distance from my home and office. I'm willing to admit that I might have a higher # of bad visits simply because I go here a lot (something about percentages, and ratios, and odds, and blah-blah-blah). 

In any case, I still support the Amelie's brand. I've visited the other locations and it seems the problems are isolated to this one. The one bright spot to this location, as of late, is the bar staff -- they've been great the few times I've sat at the bar and they have a nice selection of wine and bubbly stuff. The baristas making the coffee bevs are usually great, as well. 

According to Yelp, 2 stars is the same as saying \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that is a perfect way to describe it. Namely, the better experience was at the Uptown location roughly this time last year and/or the NoDa location present day. :\"}
{"text":"Had a egg croissant for breakfast that was good. They have a pretty large place with a server that takes the food to you. Pretty friendly staff."}
{"text":"good at 2am when you can't drink alcohol but still have the energy for shenanigans. not good when you realise price and quality do not match"}
{"text":"One of the best baguettes in Charlotte. Great petite desserts. A little pricy. Counter-culture vibe might not appeal to the masses."}
{"text":"The desserts are decent but a bit overpriced at times and the coffee is kind of bitter. It's a good place to hang out with free wi-fi but it is always busy and a bit noisy."}
{"text":"Please hire additional staff so you can accomodate the lunchtime crowd. The line is unorganized and the one or two folks taking orders appear overwhelmed. Also, they always run out of quiche and on a couple of occasions the soup dejour of the day was not ready @ 12:30 (that is lunch time guys). Get it together or close until you can serve your customers the right way."}
{"text":"My wife and I grabbed a light lunch here. My first impressions were dashed by the young man behind the pastry counter, aggressively and constantly barking at the customers about forming a line at one end of the counter. Maybe marking the desired flow on the floor would help to inform the customers. 
I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on croissant, wife ordered BLT on baguette, both ordered the Creme brûlée French soda to drink. 
My sandwich arrived as ordered but my wife's sandwich was on croissant. No big deal as her sandwich was delicious, as was mine. The French sodas were unique and tasty.
We stopped by the pastry counter to grab a few treats on our way out. The same barking man at the counter continued his aggressive behavior. My wife asked about the macaroons, \"Are the different colors a different flavor?\", he simply replied \"Yes\". He knew we didn't know which flavors were which color, Since each flavor is not marked. She had to ask \"Can you give me the run down, what flavor each one is?\". He very quickly flew thru the flavors for each. A very simple solution would be the MARK THE FLAVORS in the case!  
Anyway, the ladies behind the counter were friendly enough but the overall experience was \"meh\". 
If I owned this business, the barking young man would not survive another day behind my counter, as he is most likely running off repeat customers."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much we had to come back the next day. Baguette breakfast sandwich is gooooood.  Creme Brûlée is good. Spinach, Asparagus, Leek and Asiago Quiche was good. 

The Vanilla Strawberry Petit Gateaux was the best item and everyone agreed it was the favorite from the dozen or so we tried as a group. Will definitely be back if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Being new to the area I was looking for a fun, chic and good bakery. Everyone began suggesting Amelie's so I thought we'd try it. The atmosphere is very hipster, and sort of eery. Pastries were OK, definitely not worth the price. Coffee too wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Really cool new location. This is a large and spacious French bakery and their food and drinks are delicious. I tried the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and the cafe au lait which were both fantastic. 

There is tons of seating on multiple levels and all the ordering of food and drinks is on the main floor. They're busy but lines move fast so be ready with what you want to order. Tons of options."}
{"text":"Nice staff at the counter, large selection of drinks and yummy looking goodies, cute ambiance... 

The greatest downfall and why I'll never return? Got three quarters of the way done with my pastry (salted brownie) which was great until I took one of the last few remaining bites and proceeded to pull a long dark hair from my mouth... 

YUP I found a hair in my food. 
My hair is blonde and short. 'Twas not mine.

I was mortified. Sorta wanted to puke. 
My first and last visit. Though I'm sure it hasn't happened that much before...."}
{"text":"I love this place! I don't have a huge sweet tooth but I'd never pass up Amelie's. I love the fact that they're open 24/7 and you can literally go at any time of the day. The atmosphere can vary depending on what time of the day you catch them at. The pastries are always freshly made and are not too sweet. The wait staff is always fantastic and take care of customers in a timely manner."}
{"text":"First time here. Impressed with the decor and the service. Excellent desserts, pastries and wonderful sandwiches.
Great beverages too. Can't wait for the new location in Carmel commons to open"}
{"text":"I decided for once to stay in a different part of Charlotte on this trip in (instead of Trade & Tryon, which has been the epicenter of the recent riots), which gave me the opportunity to pass by Amelie's on the way to my client's office. 

Amelie's is a smallish bakery located on a quiet corner in Charlotte, near the Convention Center. There is quite a bit of seating space (2 bars, three different rooms and outdoor space) and a few options to order based on your preference. 

In a hurry? Try the separate lines for food / coffee / pastries
Riding solo? Post up at the bar tops and get access to everything. PRO TIP: skip the lines by ordering at the bar
Hot date? There's tables and couches galore, based on your 'angle'... ;)

While there, you definitely need to get their caramel toffee brownie (they have a gluten free variety too!). Coffee is good as well. I had the egg and cheese sandwich which was light yet filling, and with some hot sauce is really good for breakfast. 

All in all, I recommend stopping in Amelie's if you're in Charlotte, at a minimum for the caramel brownies."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant I have been to the one in NoDA and in uptown. Down side a little pricey, upside the food is fantastic! 

The decor of the restaurant is so fun, and really incorporates the Parisian theme. The restaurant is very clean. If you go in the morning, lunchtime, or dinnertime the line gets really long, but the staff tries to move fast. Luckily it is open 24/7 so you can go whenever! 

My favorite part is the lavender! Acquired taste for sure, but if you love lavender you must go!! The lavender lemonade is so refreshing and delicious. They also just got macron ice cream sandwiches and they have a lavender lemonade one! So good!!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is amazing!  The gluten free salted caramel brownie is to die for!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day for a salted caramel brownie and an eclaire. As always, the bakery items were great. Service is always on point also. If you are in the mood for lunch you can also grab a sandwich"}
{"text":"A Charlotte institution, Amelie's serves up delicious desserts, sandwiches and coffee in a hip NoDa location ... 24 hours a day. Admittedly, I've had better pastries, but not at 12:30 in the morning. While a little removed from the bustle of Uptown, it remains one of the best spots in Charlotte to satisfy that late-night craving for caffeine, sweets and free Wi-Fi. Settle down in one of their comfortable armchairs or grab a cozy table for two, order a coffee and a chocolate torte, and just enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE:
- The cute and quirky decor
- Four words: OPEN. TWENTY. FOUR. HOURS. Whoever owns Amelie's understands the human impulse for pastries at ungodly hours.
- Three more words: SALTED. CARAMEL. BROWNIE. To die for!!
- Breakfast sandwich on croissant: get it with the sausage, it is amazing!

LIKE:
- Vanilla eclair: The first time I had it it was perfect. But the second time I had it, the pastry itself tasted stale, like it sat in the fridge for too long
- Chocolate torte: Just.... very chocolatey. Meh.
- Raspberry lemon tart

LOATHE:
- Nothing! It can be too crowded at certain times though, which is sad if your initial plan is to plop down at a table or the sofas for awhile to enjoy your goodies."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Florida, and at first I was so excited to have found a French Bakery especially close to my new home, but today was my 3rd time there as I truly wanted to love this place, and unfortunately it's not working out...
-First time I went the quiche was cold in the middle; and it seems the staff matched that very same state.
-Second time I tested them to make sure maybe it was just a one time little boo boo (i mean no one's perfect..no big deal) but lol the quiche was again cold in the center ...?!? I tried their mini cake bouchée which was good except for the chocolate one that tasted like dirt+sugar, but no offense that's just cause I hate chocolate. My bad-I guess I was hoping that place would change that but oh well..! 
The staff it feels wanted to be nice, I mean the effort was there but wasn't fooling anyone. 
-So the third time I went, the mixed berry tart was good! But the macaroons I had to throw away except the cotton candy one.. That time the staff seemed to me that they just didnt want to be there..

It's unfortunate to see a place with such great potential can be sooo careless about their guests' satisfaction. For a bakery to be selling \"sweets\", well the staff is just bitter! Or maybe it's my fault for having greater expectations... and they shld start warming up these quiches to a higher degree btw!!!"}
{"text":"Brand new uptown location is beautiful!  There's much more seating area than the noda location.  Desserts don't differ in taste from their noda location."}
{"text":"Why does Charlotte love Amélie'? because...obviously..
1) This one is around the clock 24/7.
2) The roast beef on a croissant is over-the-top.
3) Everyone raves about the salted caramel brownie. My next visit mission to find out why this brownie gained such prominence.

Four and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"Everyone meets clients for drinks. 
You want to be everyone? I don't think so.
You want to be the fella who walked them to the fantastical world of Amélie's. You can't go wrong with the fan-favorite Salted Caramel Brownies, right?! They'll love it that much they'll have to practice some self-control, or you'll be blamed for their addiction. (P.S available in gluten-free!)
You'd like the casual, unorthodox and cluttered décor with the untraditional lamps and interesting chandeliers. 
Personally, other than the salted caramel brownie, I can barely resist the flaky layers of the Napoleon. On the savory side, I like the Roast Beef Croissant. I'm pretty sure that charming Parisian girl named Amélie would have loved their Café au lait as much as I do.

Five Yelps."}
{"text":"During my first visit to Amelie's I was blown away by the size of the location. Despite extending through half of the building it can be difficult to find a seat, and I've struggled to connect to their WiFi.

The pastries are disappointing, and the food is not great either. I think it's a good place to go if you want to grab a cup of coffee and be amongst others."}
{"text":"This is definitely a pretty good bakery to go to if you are looking for something relatively simple. When we got there, the line was wrapped around the building so it was definitely the place to be. Overall just a good bakery."}
{"text":"I must admit, I do love this place! Best as it gets around here, esp after having macaron withdrawals from places like LA and Boston. Best thing about it? They're open 24/7! Any time i'm in NC I always stop by on my way home to SC. 

Typically they don't fail me. I've been satisfied 90% of the time, but the last time I was there the quality of the macarons definitely dropped. 

One of my favorite things to get are the salted caramel brownies, they're to die for. Matter of fact, I want one now (:

Cute arrangement and decor. Seems to attract a lot of college kids, but I like the atmosphere nonetheless. I always go pretty late and it's always busy. Very hard to find parking and guaranteed a line inside. I take my goodies to go, so I have nothing to say about seating. 

Will I be going back? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The perfect place to come to relax, read a book, get some work done, etc...

Best part about it is that they have amazing baked goods, drinks and sandwiches. I've never been to a bakery in which everything they offer is absolutely delicious. The décor here is funky, but that's what makes this place unique. This place is a must for anyone in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"They just got bumped to 5 star status after my last visit.....


So the scene is an early Saturday morning.....and another Bank conversion is in play for me.  

As I hate for my team to have to work on the weekends, I was on point to pick up breakfast and Amelies was one of the few places open on a Saturday morning (as I had already done the Einstein's/Bruggers the last event).

I walked in an immediately filled an order for over 60 pastries.  They completed my order without blinking an eye.  Boxed and bagged up, I thanked them and was on my way........it may be a hipster hangout, but these folks are nothing but professional....plus their stuff tastes great!"}
{"text":"The food and quality here is amazing. The salted caramel brownie is incredible. I also love the cream cheese puffs too. Heck, everything here is good. Just be careful when you go because a long line is not uncommon."}
{"text":"Treats are good.. but very expensive for size etc.. great spot to meet with friends and have a cup of coffee.."}
{"text":"Decent pastries and drinks. Whimsical old France atmosphere that is nearly too much. 
PS - They don't validate parking."}
{"text":"Looooooooove this spot. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is DEFinitely one place to check out. Just about everything sweet that I've had here has been magNIficent. I never even thought I would dig macaroons like that, but at Amelie's, I do! And they have sooo many flavors! One of my favorite sweets, that may just send you into an immediate diabetic coma, fyi, is the Salted Caramel Brownie TORTE. DeeeeeeeeeeeeeLIcious. If you've had the Salted Caramel Brownie and loved it, I strongly recommend upgrading to its even lovelier big brother. I also really dig their teacakes -- lemon, almond, annnd raspberry. On the non-sweets side, I LOVE their Spinach-Artichoke Soup!! And a few of their croissant sandwiches. So much delicioiusness here. The only dish I would not recommend here is any salad. I feel like they don't give you much for the price, and what little they do give you isn't great. Other than that, the only other halfway negative about this place is that most of the sweets are not cheap! Which I guess can be a good thing so you don't overdue it and expand in your waistline as you shrink in your wallet, ha! But nonetheless, it is something worth mentioning.

And other than the edible goods here, I just LOVE Amelie's as a whole -- the real laidback, chill atmosphere...and the very eclectic people (to match the also-very eclectic decor).. many who tend to be very friendly and conversational if you're up for it! It's a great place to go and either hang out with friends or solo, study, read a book, write a paper, hit up after the club, or just chill out. ALSO, and one of the greatest things of all: It's 24 HOURS, 7 DAYS A WEEK!!!! How many places in Charlotte (or North Carolina) are there that you can say that about?

So yes... Amelie's: One of my faves."}
{"text":"I love this spot! It's a perfect place to go and get some work done! I am obsessed with their coffee and the quiche they have on the weekend is the best around. 

The only complaint I have is many of the outlets are very old, understandably, and my macbook charger falls out of the outlet each time I plug it in."}
{"text":"In a nut shell, I am a vegan and amelies offers no vegan options... Having said that,  I live extremely close to amelies and have visited the bakery several times when friends and family are around.  On my visits I do politely ask if there are any vegan options that they offer and usually I get a friendly no,... however the last time I went the person behind the counter was so utterly rude about it it makes me not want to visit this place.  I understand my dietary needs are a choice and by no means to I expect everyone to conform to them, but I don't think it's appropriate when a suggestive question is posed that they be rude about it.  I'm just sayin! ;)  In other news... if you know of any places that have vegan dessert options (other than zizis) lemme know, as I've got a wicked sweet tooth!!!"}
{"text":"When i think French bakery i think Pain au chocolat! I went to Amélie's ready to order it and was told they had none. Mind you this was at 11 am on Easter so you would think better planning would have taken place!! At the register i was told that the bakers only made one tray of pain au chocolat that morning!! How ridiculous!! I'm visiting Charlotte so this was my one chance to experience Amélie's French pastries! Disappointed customer to say the least!!"}
{"text":"When you wait in line for 45 minutes on a week night to order pastries, you expect them to be delicious. Luckily, Amelie did not disappoint. I'd say it's a solid A-Ok on the verge of 4 stars!

After waiting in line for what felt like forever, we finally reached the counter (Joy!). Angels started singing and a variety of pastries were revealed. I personally tried a macaroon, a salted caramel brownie and a lemon meringue torte. All were good, but I wouldn't say any were excellent. I found the macaroon to be a little on the dry/hard side and the (gasp!) chocolate caramel brownie to be a bit over-rated (I would have liked more of a salty flavor in the caramel). The lemon meringue torte was cute and tasty and was a little sweeter than I expected it to be (I prefer a little more tang).

The decor was a tad creepy in an Alice in Wonderland way, and I couldn't quite decide if I liked it or would find it unnerving over a longer visit. Also, I think the line could be more efficient if there were menus with pictures/descriptions customers could look at prior to reaching the counter. 

I'd come back again and would try some different items, but I'd also try to time it better so as not to hit a rush (which seems like it may be challenging given the popularity of Amalie."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, I heard about this place from some of my classmates.  Since then, I have gone several times, and I have to admit how much I love this place.  The have a GREAT salted caramel brownie, tea cakes, and tarts.  I've ordered soup before as well, the sweet potato bisque, and I think it was one of the best soups I've ever eaten.  And they're open 24 hours, what more could a college student ask for?  Good coffee, which they have.

And the decor is quite eclectic.  I just love the furniture and the ambiance of the place.  It has a very artsy feel to it, which is quite comforting to me.

The only down side to this place is the price of items.  Yes, everything is very delicious, but you pay for the quality of the items.  I bought a cup of soup there, which came with a small slice of baguette, a brownie and a coffee.  This came to just over $8.  It was good, but a little steep."}
{"text":"Am I alone in the world here? Amelie's is a beautiful, whimsical place, great for doing work or people watching. But the pastries are a flat C. I've been here four times since I've moved to Charlotte, and not once have I had anything that could even be described as \"good.\" Not the eclairs, saltwater caramel brownies, macaroons, chocolate mousse, almond cakes--nothing. I'm sure there are way tastier (and less expensive) offerings around the QC. Don't get me wrong--it's really pretty in there. Like a girl's daydream after watching Amelie; and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 1/2. The treats (and I loooove treats) just aren't that great."}
{"text":"In the middle of the afternoon, too early for dinner, too late for lunch, this is the best place to go, a different world not only in regards to the interior design seemingly going back in time, but also in regards to the taste buds which are going to be spoiled quite a bit. A seducing selection of pastries but also a la carte sandwiches etc let you indulge."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY! Loved their grapefruit tarragon soda. This place is giant, and has an awesome, eclectic decor that is definitely French-inspired. There are mixes between traditional tables, bistro tables, and straight up couches to sit on."}
{"text":"Love the space and the food. My only comment is that employees shouldn't eat in view of customers. A BIG no no. A worker was chomping down pastries from behind the bakery counter. While five people stood in line to pay, watching her. Very off putting."}
{"text":"Not a Sunday goes by where I don't have coffee at Amelie's French Bakery with my friends. They have the best desserts in Charlotte, so many coffee choices, fresh food, and one of the best atmospheres you'll ever experience. I highly recommend the Le Sombre Chai and a fruit and yogurt parfait with homemade granola!

The salted caramel brownie is to die for! The girls and I love grabbing wine and macarons on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"A nice stopover for coffee and dessert after going out in Uptown"}
{"text":"Yet another frozen napoleon.... and an attempt from a rather rude individual to educate me.... considering I have been eating them for over 30 years... it fell on deaf ears... and he was a douche bag to boot. Then tried to educate me on health code.... I'm food and safety certified and my first restaurant I owned at 18.. again on deaf ears... he was again a douche... me brining a major celebrity in the music industry here as a treat was a mistake.... we both returned our desserts."}
{"text":"I wish that being at Amelie's was the same as wanting to be at Amelie's. I'm always disappointed. It looked like they sorted out the whole line situation on my latest visit. But they only half solved the problem. I appreciate the tremendous improvement in signage. But it's still far too slow. 

Today... I wanted a sandwich and a twice baked croissant. Got in the 'everything' line. Waited about 15 minutes, ordered the twice baked croissant from the pastry desk. Couldn't order my sandwich then. Was told to wait to order the sandwich at the register. 5 minutes later, ordered the sandwich. Was surprised they put together my sandwich as quickly as they did! Then was terribly disappointed when I opened my bag to find a cold, prepared-earlier-in-the-day croissant with chicken salad. 

Ugh. If I wanted a cold prepared sandwich from the case, I'd save half my money and get it from the Teeter or get one as good for a few dollars less at Something Classic. And save at least 20 minutes! Instead I waited about 30 minutes for a very mediocre sandwich. 

I hate getting fooled over and over. There's way too little consistency for me to 1) recommend or 2) go back."}
{"text":"Fun funky decor, very tasty pastry's and a lot of room.

We were in Charlotte for the summer and this place became my wife's Spirit Animal.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, so the perfect place to work or grab a late-night snack. Their chai latte's are also one of the best"}
{"text":"Looked up this place when I was trying to find a good place for dessert on the day of Christmas Eve, one of the best dessert places open 24/7.
Tried few of the pastries here and they melt in your mouth. I never tried anything other than cakes and pastries here and I just love them."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. The food was delicious, but it was a very small serving size for a 1/2 sandwich. I got the 1/2 turkey and Brie sandwich and cup of asparagus, leek and spinach soup. The 1/2 sandwich was smaller than my phone at about 3 inches long.  The price was $6.59 for such a small serving. While delicious, it was not worth it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I. Love. Amelie's.  The atmosphere, the food, the coffee, the ambience--everything.  No wonder so many people have given this place 5 stars; and the fact that it's uptown--you can't get any better than that.  Just hope on the Lynx, walk a couple blocks and you're there. I like the uptown location better than the NoDa one to be honest.  

The only thing I wish they had were more vegan-friendly options--that would make this place perfect."}
{"text":"Two stars for the pastry, five for people watching. Had an eclair, it was very average compared to the bakeries that I eat at in Paris. The decoration is very Dorothy Draper, which I loved. Good French sodas though."}
{"text":"Great place for latte/pastries. The NODA location is fine, but the newest location on HWY 51 is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm a weekly customer at Amelie's and everything I've had on the menu is delicious! Can't give them 5 stars due to the ordering process. Everyone is filtered into one line so if you want to order lunch you sometimes get stuck behind 20 people who want something out of the pastry case but take forever deciding. (I understand the decision can be tough.) The ordering process makes Amélie's a leisurely lunch spot, not a quick grab lunch spot"}
{"text":"Amelie's is delicious and a great place for our small book group to meet.  They make a great French press & everything I've had to eat there is out of this WORLD!"}
{"text":"This place is a dreamscape for coffee and dessert lovers. I stood in a queue for 50 min at 1:30 AM for macaroons and a Napoleon and it was totally worth it ! I would do it all over again and wouldn't be surprised if I dream the same."}
{"text":"If you been to the other Amelie's locations, then you definitely will not be disappointed with this location! Roomy, lots of different seating options (outside too!), bright walls, art, ceiling fixtures, and very very friendly staff! Abundant parking!

Lots and lots of freshly baked pastry and lunch options. Vegetarian friendly. Tons of drinks to choose from. Hot or iced, coffee or tea, seltzer/spritzer style, and juice-like in REAL cups! To-go cups are also available though. No pour-over option, but the Cafe Creme did me just fine! 

Very clean place because the staff are always walking around and taking away your dirty dishes. Bathrooms are gender specific, fairly cheery, decently spacious, and decently clean. There's even a sink outside of them in case you just need to wash your hands. Very cool idea. 

Trust me friends, no need to go to the Caribou or Suarez Bakery nearby. Amelie's will take great care of you! 

Most definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"While the staff quality, food quality, and coffee quality are consistent with other Amelie's locations, something about this space doesn't feel right. I think it's the open box style of the dining area. There are two forced nooks that try to capture the \"living room feel\" of the uptown location, but it just doesn't seem to work for me. The majority of tables are right in the middle of the place which gives it a Panera feel which I don't care for. Many of them had dirty dishes on them. There are some quaint seating options by the large windows, but again, not enough to make me feel quite relaxed. However, the covered outside seating is rather attractive and abundant and doesn't face the parking lot. The bathrooms are gender specific, cramped, and rough around the edges. Fixtures are dull  and a little aged and the floor was grimy and paper towel laden. 

If I found myself in the area, I would probably stop in again, but I wouldn't make it a destination place."}
{"text":"Ok, several visits here over the past few months. 

Here's the good:

Beverage selection- Something for everyone!
Food menu- Something for everyone! Sweet or sandwich or soup! 
Ambiance- Bright, artistic, musical
Seating- tons. comfortable. big variety.
Staff- genuine. helpful. friendly.
People watching- excellent place for it! 
Restrooms- roomy. mostly clean.

Here's the bad:

Drip coffee is pretty basic tasting. French press better, but not awesome. 
Pastries are hit and miss flavor and quality wise. 
Prices are a little steep for some items that lack consistency.
Restrooms can sometimes be a little grungy and at times lacking soap.

I keep coming back though because of the cheeriness of this place!"}
{"text":"Can't have a special day without the salted Carmel Brownie!   It's the best- and now they have a gluten free offering too!!   It's so sweet with a nice cafe mocha- hits the spot!"}
{"text":"The service was great, cute small place. Pus the food was great would definitely suggest. Love this place!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW. Amelie's, please come to Raleigh! This food joint is a dream come true! 

-It's open 24 hours! The first food joint in NC that I have heard of that does this. 
-You can get a quarter, half or full baguette warmed up and sliced with butter or spread. The quarter baguette makes for the PERFECT snack when you are feeling peckish. I really enjoyed the smoked gouda spread.
-They have tons of delicious authentic french desserts on display that you just can't resist. We shared the large mousse cup and it was fantastic.
-Tartines!!!
-Baguettes!! (again)
-Cute decor, nice staff and plenty of seating.
-Plenty of breakfast/brunch items and standard coffee shop drinks.
-Did I say fresh, warm baguettes??? :)

I guess it is good that Amelie's is not in Raleigh, because I would literally be there every day."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place after hearing  such great things. I visited today with my little nieces. The décor is nice but service was terrible besides one smiling person. The only smiling person!. I was there for the first time with my nieces trying to give them a unique experience and  it wasn't as expected. I walked in asked a simple question about which was the  beverage , the pastry line .. only because someone behind the counter called out \" can I help anyone with pastries \" I thought maybe there were two lines so I asked politely which one was for pastries. I didn't cut the line or assumed where it started . I asked !!  person behind the counter said  \"if you want pastries you have to stand in line\" .. well duh !! I knew that and it wasn't the question. 

The person that helped us wasn't even friendly to my nieces 6, and 7 years of age.. no smile , no warmness  nothing. Folks looked at us like we had five heads or like we didn't belong or something. I was very disappointed in the way we were treated. We were rushed and pushed along like sheep. It wasn't super packed although we couldn't sit inside.  I had to sit outside wind blowing everything everywhere and all.  I didn't get any service that people on yelp raved about not even my sweet innocent nieces. The pastries were ok and way over priced. I wont be going back mainly due to the very poor service we received. I wont be recommending it to friends or co workers because if your spending your hard earned money in a business the least they can do is fake a smile.  I was surprised at the attitude and lack of service."}
{"text":"Every pastry I have tried here is good but the twice baked Chocolate, Almond and Pistachio croissants are the best to me. They also seem to sell out the fastest. If you want to make sure that you have your choice of the full selection of the pastries, it's better to go early in the morning. The evenings are the most crowded and they run out of a lot of items. They also offer breakfast sandwiches. 

There is a smaller location Uptown that has a more limited pastry selection. They really need to  build more of these in other parts of Charlotte too :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered a beautiful tray of mini desserts here. 

Pros - DELICIOUS and perfect size

Cons- SO expensive for what you get - spent $30+ per tray. Also, it's just in a box? They don't even give you a plastic tray to serve on so that was an inconvenience. Also they don't have skim milk...only whole or almond!

Def give it a try, but maybe don't order the trays to go as they are quite pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Something for everyone! Fresh baked pastries and fun coffee drinks. A bit pricy but fun to treat your self! I got the mini tarts"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for coffee, small bite, or dessert. Phenomenal homemade soups. Staff is very friendly and quick service"}
{"text":"Its very spacious compared to the one in downtown which I really like! The pastries were amazing still however it just seemed like the people working were really slow or confused. There is also an outside patio which is nice to sit at even in this humid weather. The area seems to be kept cool by the fan so its nice to be able to sit outside and relax."}
{"text":"Amelie's is awesome. Great pastries, sandwiches, coffee...etc. The people that work here are very friendly and professional. The place has a great atmosphere. The quiche for breakfast is a must! The Salted Caramel Brownie is a must for sweet snack. They have plenty of outlets to power your laptop or any other charging needs you may have. They never pressure you into a quick trip. This place is a great place to meet up with friends to hang out or a place to come and get some work done. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I take everyone who visits me to Amelie's! Yes, sometimes I use visitors as an excuse to go and get a delicious treat! You can't go wrong with any of their items! The NODA location is always open and that is such a plus for those who work odd hours! 

They have the BEST macaroons I have ever had. They are pricey, but worth it. Get the cinnamon chocolate! 

Other good items to try:
-Bacon egg and asiago cheese breakfast sandwich on a French baguette. 
-A Napoleon
-Lemon and raspberry tart
-chocolate mousse cup (this is very rich)"}
{"text":"Wanted chocolate covered strawberries at midnight for my fiancée, ran across uptown and couldn't find a place...after a thorough check via YELP, I found Amelies! 
That is by FAR the best place in all of Charlotte to get a desert, especially late at night when nothing else is open!
Thank you Amelie's for being a life saver"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been here but first time reviewing. 

 Amelie is a very cute and interesting place. 
With so many pastries to go and a few gluten free options, which makes me happy. 
The fact that they stay open 24/7 is great. 

They offer gluten free bread for breakfast sandwiches, so obviously I went with that. The bread was buttery and held it's own very well. On the sandwich I ordered egg, bacon, cheddar, spinach and tomatoes. 
Everything was good until I realized they forgot my bacon, by then we were on the road already. 

My husband had a croissant which he thought was perfect. 

Coffee was delicious and we took some pastries to go, including the famous gluten free salted caramel brownie."}
{"text":"It has been a while that I have been here but it stuck to me how delicious macaroons were  and the lovely ambiance.  
The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Their coffee is incredibly sub-par. The aroma is lacking and it tastes like they leave the beans in open air.

Aside from that, if you love french baked goods (loaded up with eggs, butter and sugar), you'll probably love here. In the display case you can find an array of beautiful tarts, cakes, croissants, eclairs and chocolates. Seeing I'm vegan, I have zero options for their baked goods, they don't offer any vegan sandwiches but occasionally have a vegan-friendly soup. My meat-and-cheese-eating friend said, \"try anything, and you won't regret it\".

This place is open 24-7 and I have yet to ever see the place not busy! Usually all of the tables/chairs/couches are littered with people, but if you can find a spot, this place is prime people watching territory!"}
{"text":"When guests come in to town to visit, this is literally top of our list of places to take them to experience. The food and drinks are some of the best around and the wait staff is always SO friendly. We frequent Amelie's as much as we possibly can. Highly, highly recommend to anyone and everyone! P.s. the tartes are our personal fav."}
{"text":"It's not the bakery that I go for, even though their Eclairs and Macaroons are the closes thing to heaven! It's the 24 hour availability the delicious sandwiches and coffee drinks and the free wifi. This is a great place to kick back and get some reading done or just people watch. Also, a great place to take visitors. They're impressed overtime."}
{"text":"I adore Amelies. I've only been to two of their locations, but they are consistent with their service and culture at both.  I'm a big fan of french food and pastries so this place is right up my alley.  Their almond milk latte's are fabulous, and they always have their lavender syrup on hand for their lemonade so getting a lavender latter is high on my priority list.  When I want macaroons, i go here, when i want comfort food of a crostini or croque monsuer, i go here.   But to be fair, i also go here when i need a light salad for days when i am trying to respect my diet.  :)  the setup is easy, separate coffee bar, they also serve wine/beer, but you get in line, place your order, then they bring you food.  its great for quick lunches or if you're like me and will park there for a few hours on the laptop."}
{"text":"Amelie's is one of my favorite spots to work, study, meet with friends, or grab coffee and pastries.  I'm aware of the other locations, but this one is my fave as it's open 24/7.  Since I am a remote employee, I often claim this as my office for the day and I'm always able to get a lot done while enjoying a sweet delight from a variety of pastries or a savory selection of sandwiches, quiches, or salads.  I love the variety of beverages as well- everything from coffee, bottled drinks, refreshing lemonades and teas.

My ultimate favorites are the salted caramel brownie, pecan sticky bun, palmier, lemon cream cheese pocket, or a pecan tart.  My friends often rave about the macaroons, but I'll take their word for it as I'm not a fan of any type of macaroons.  Word of advice, usually around Thursday- Saturday nights are the busiest and the line is usually wrapped around into the sitting area.  If you're unable to find a seat, you can also sit anywhere in the common area outside of the bakery."}
{"text":"So happy theres an Amelie's Bakery in Pineville now. The Gluten free egg sandwich is so good, also the famous macaroons!"}
{"text":"It's a good place, the food is good, the price is good and the decoration is crazy in the good way, you feel like you're on \"Friends\" the tv series, I will recommended this place 100% ;)"}
{"text":"Nice place to enjoy a cup of coffee and have small breakfast. Lot of seating. Friendly service. Visually nice to look at. Free WIFI. Delicious breakfast sandwiches (the croissant is buttery) Very buttery but good.

Time of Visit: Late breakfast
Wait: No line, short wait for food.
Price: $22 [ 2 breakfast sandwiches + 1 latte + 1 iced coffee]
Service: Friendly and respectful (a lot of ma'am and sir greetings)

Items ordered:
- Breakfast sandwich ($5.29) croissant, sausage, egg and cheese - The eggs was nicely scrambled and not runny or too hard. Add that to the buttery croissant and I'm a happy little camper. 
- Breakfast sandwich ($5.29) baguette, gruyère (+.75), bacon, and egg. He enjoyed the eggs and that little extra crunch on the baguette bread.
- Small (dirty) chai latte
- Large iced coffee

Would I return: Yes.

Notes:
- You order your sandwiches & drinks as the counter. If you'd like a pastry, you pick it up by the pastry showcase and bring it to the counter.
- After order they give you one of those \"buzzer\" devices. Keep in mind it doesn't actually buzz. You're to pick a table and place it on the device so someone can bring you your items.
- Keep you eyes open when you see a server in your area. Turns out some table devices got mixed up and your table number may not match what they see on their end. Having your server bring food to someone else table or find him/her wondering around annoucing your order number.
-As much as I LOVE croissants and buttery goodness, my body sort of opposed and left me feeling a little upset. Don't worry, my body tends to veto unhealthy foods anyway. We've been in an on going fight for years now. Sadly I don't listen."}
{"text":"Like everyone else in Charlotte, I love Amelie's, especially this location. It's beautiful, parking is easy, and there's tons of seating. Being open 24/7 is a little weird, but obviously it works for them. I tend to frequent during more normal coffee-shop hours, but I've seen lines out the door at 10pm on Saturdays, so who am I to judge.

After reading through some of these reviews here and reflecting on my past visits, I guess they do have quite a few gluten-free options - the bread for sandwiches is great, and obviously the salted-caramel brownie is a winner. I'm one of those annoying Northeast transplants, though, so I'm used to being able to get the gluten-free version of literally anything; my first visit to Amelie's was a little disappointing in that arena, only because everything in the display case looked unbelievably delicious but was also flour-filled. Since that initial visit, I've realized that the wheat-free soups are a major find, and that Amelie's does make an intentional effort to cater to the obnoxious gluten-free customer.

Atmosphere is everything. I've posted many an Instagram photo from the lovely, cozy corners of this cafe. It's a beautiful place that NoDa is very lucky to have."}
{"text":"I love the space. I'm a big fan of Amelie's and I was happy to know there are more then one."}
{"text":"I love Amelie's. Every time I'm in Charlotte, I have to go. My favorite's are the chocolate croissant and the pecan tart!"}
{"text":"What a place!! Conveniently located in Uptown, Amelie's makes me excited to go to work in the morning if only for the coffee breaks. Provisions aside, this converted parking garage has an outrageously cool interior that delivers good vibes on the gloomiest of days. But the food and beverages served here are quite good too, making Amelie's a worthy place for a morning pit stop or afternoon pick-me-up.

Amelie's serves a variety of foods, including make-your-own breakfast sandwiches (highly recommend), quiches, and a variety of treats and pastries. Note that while hot food can sometimes take longer to come out during busier times (you can pick up the pastries and go), the options here are easily healthier and higher-quality than your typical fare from Starbucks and the like - where else can you choose from cheddar, asiago, mozzarella, gruyere, brie, and manchego as the cheese options for your breakfast sandwich?

On the drinks side, Amelie's serves a number of its own espresso creations, ranging from the potent (cafe capuchon, cafe glace) to the indulgent (cafe marcotter, cafe dauphine). I've tried both types and have had pleasant experiences both ways, so there is something for everyone here. Additionally, non-coffee drinkers need not feel excluded either as there is a \"les sans café\" and a cold drinks part of the menu that offers creations like french soda, a house-made lemonade, and hot chocolate drinks. It's hard to not find at least one thing you'll like here.

The service here is very pleasant and the store's decor gives you a lot to look at as you're waiting for your order. The prices don't break the bank either, and are definitely reasonable considering the quality. I always look forward to coming here!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the things I miss about Charlotte. Open 24 hours and always enjoy what I order, whether savory or sweet. (Usually come for dessert though!) The salted caramel square, macarons and croissants are my favorites.  I also like that they have non-dairy options for coffee instead of just milk or cream.  

Great place to get a delicious dessert on holidays when other places are closed."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a nice bakery. The space is very stylish and spacious. Almost like a more spacious Paris alley cafe. The line to order food is quite confusing and the location to pick up the food is all the way on the other side. Their selection of food is quite nice as you can combine certain items. The soup was pretty nice as well as the sandwich. The ready-made snacks were amazing as well."}
{"text":"There is no denying that Amelies is the current it spot in Charlotte. At night you will wait in line no less than 30 min for a treat. I've been here several times and do love the macaroons. But will never understand the line. The reason for my low review is simple. Great food does not make up for rude staff. Most recently I took my fiance here for a birthday goody. When we did finally get up to order one order taker skipped us and went to the older couple behind us. When we did get help I made mention that it was her birthday. I asked if she got anything for that as I over heard the order taker offer it to another patron for their birthday. We again got ignored. I just don't find this acceptable. Treat people with respect I don't care how long the line is."}
{"text":"Of all the Amelie's locations, this one is probably my favorite. (The uptown spot is probably my 2nd favorite.) The pastries have always been a little hit or miss for me. Salted caramel brownie? Hit!! Eclairs? Miss. And, I'll never understand why macaroons are so freaking expensive. But, the menu items are always a big ol' hit in my book. I love their daily soup offerings paired with a sandwich, tartine or even just 1/2 a baguette with a spread or two. I also love the lavender lemonade. 

This spot can get packed! When it's crowded, service can be pretty slow. If you hit them at an off-time, it's easy to find a table and staff are fairly pleasant and efficient. Fun decor! Be sure to look around while you're there."}
{"text":"We love Amélies! I am a huge an of the decor and overall feeling. The barista and counter service at this location were excellent! Very kind and seemed happy. The treats were great as well. We also had leek soup and quiche which was delicious. Although, the more I go, the less I love their sweets. I feel like they're missing something? Either way, I still love the cafe!"}
{"text":"My wife saw a story on TV about Amelie's and suddenly \"we had to go\"!  So, we took a field trip from Ballantyne to NoDa to check it out.

For a French bakery, it's pretty lame when I can say Williams-Sonoma frozen chocolate croissants are night and day better than Amelie's.   We got a chocolate and cream cheese croissant and while they were both tasty, they were spongy and not flaky... ie, they lacked the actual appeal of a croissant.  The cream cheese puff was also very tasty, but chewy as if it was a day old or older.  For a place that's open 24 hours, you'd think they have fresher pastries in the case.

We really wanted to like Amelie's... but we will probably never go back unless we have other business to tend to in NoDa."}
{"text":"This place is just nasty. The employees here can be so rude. 
They use disgusting ingredients on top of it too like high fructose corn syrup- ish! 
I ordered a sandwich and it was put in wrong. It took me almost a half hour to get it sorted out only to be met by a sarcastic cashier tell me, \"we are REALLY busy\" when he was the one who screwed my order up in the first place. They took my sandwich back in the kitchen, put an egg on it and brought it back to me. I had ordered a bacon, egg, cheese croissant and was given a BLT, they put an egg on the BLT, lettuce and all and slopped it back in a to go bag. No thanks. Will NEVER eat here again. 
My first experience here was ordering a birthday cake that literally had two inches of butter cream in between two tiny slivers of cakes. Literally everyone at the party threw it out. I emailed to complain and wasn't even offered a refund! Thought I'd given them another shot- nope. Still nasty."}
{"text":"Good selection of baked goods. Quite energetic. Located in the heart of the city. Recommended."}
{"text":"Love Amelie's and all the French pastries. I ordered the season macaroons and their summer hand crafted lemonade which is awesome. Always great service when I come here and very clean as well."}
{"text":"I love this bakery! The salted caramel brownie is amazing. Macaroons are delicious! Leek soup was good"}
{"text":"I had the green iced tea with a cinnamon macroon and a mini fruit tart. Everything was delicious! It was a little pricey, but the place was a great go to for dessert! Parking can be kind of tricky, but we were fortunate enough to find parking in the front."}
{"text":"Going to Amelie's is always a treat. The Park Rd location sits behind the shopping center. There's plenty of parking and outdoor seating.

Of course, the French-inspired grubs are yummy! Amelies also offers wine! Yes, please! Naturally, Amelies is a Great place to unwind, work, or meet with friends. The atmosphere is great, and the staff is friendly. I always appreciate their recommendations. Overall this cafe is clean and tidy. 

There's a lot to choose from if you're interested in pastry and desserts, soups, salads and more. I'm truly obsessed with the macarons, the flavors change each season. I had the pleasure of trying the NEW Lavender Lemon Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich! The Lemon sorbet was zesty and refreshing. I would recommend sharing this dessert with a friend(it's huge). Naturally, I couldn't leave without purchasing a few other Macarons, I tried three new flavors (Passionfruit, Key lime, and blackberry basil). FYI the blackberry basil is DELISH!"}
{"text":"I love this location, I've been here a few times. Beats the heck out of paying for parking uptown. Ohhh and let's not forget the crazy hunt in the NoDa area. Wine Wednesday!!! Girl talk and a girl talk--My gal pal has never been here. 

The outdoor seating is awesome. Never too busy--seatings always available. This evening I noticed there was live music! I hope it's every week. The wine selection is small but satisfying, I love the wine bar. I could sit here everyday!! I love the ambiance here. Too bad it's not dog friendly--with all this beautiful weather my pup and I would enjoy the outdoor seating. 

A few of my personal favorites- let's start with the Sparkling Lavender Lemonade!! Love Love Love!! So refreshing!!! My second item of choice--The breakfast croissant topped with spinach, egg, cheese and spinach (ohhh my goodness)."}
{"text":"Let's give this review a proper title \"Ride or Die\". 
10PM I decide to make a sweets run. Of course my darling fiancé decided to stay in bed---good for you. I Text my neighbor and she's up and ready. Sneakers, yoga pants and a Hoodie. We take a 15min ride to heaven. 

I've been to this Amelies MANY times in College. 24hrs can be dangerous to your wallet. The line wasn't very long, and of course the staff was quick. We were in and out. My neighbor has never been to Amelies--She was so excited!! 

Normally parking is a pain, however I found a great spot. Upfront, there were a few college students on their labtops, studying and or hanging out. This is the perfect place to kick back and relax. I love coming here. I wish they'd serve wine like the other locations---coming soon I'm sure. 

The decor is always fun, lots for vintage inspired artwork."}
{"text":"I LOVE Amélie's French Bakery & Café! Most people come here for work or lunch hour. Occasionally, I like to escape the nightlife scene and relax with a glass of champagne and dessert!  This location was previously on South Tryon. I never had the opportunity to visit there. 

Of course, this new location is fabulous! The people are friendly, and everything is clean. Parking can be a little tricky (pay attention to the street signs). There are parking decks nearby, I would recommend carpooling with friends.

The Food is always hot and fresh. Personally, I love the spinach and leek quiche, lavender lemonade, and French macarons. Be sure to try the wine selection, you won't regret it! 

FYI: You can host events here in the upstairs area. I still haven't it. But I know it's available to reserve!"}
{"text":"Very good, had the cucumber and dill tartine, and my VERY favorite soup, the spinach asparagus leek with a coconut chai.  Brought home salted caramel brownies, always a good experience, no different experience today."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service
Went to get some pastries and got the great aspargus spinach leek soup, and a cafe mocha too.  Very nice employees, carried my food to my table so I wouldn't spill it.
Love that soup and the pastries are always great..."}
{"text":"Great location and menu. Gives a sense that you are dining in a French Bistro. Menu options include brunch items and a wide variety of pastries and cookies. I have tried the salted caramel brownies and the key lime tarts. The key lim tarts are my favorite as the custard is light and the lime flavor is very well balanced. They are open into the late evening. So a great option for after dinner dessert."}
{"text":"Everybody's got their own opinion of Amelie's, so let me make mine to-the-point:

Decor - love it. Unique, fun, and eclectic. My girlfriend thinks it's adorbs. I like it cuz it doesn't look like every other damn place in town.

Savory food - like it. The sandwiches are AMAZING, as is the quiche. The salad choices are fine, but they don't really do anything that would be considered an entree.

Bakery - Also like it. Everything Amelie's does is wonderful. You are *required* to try the chocolate torte sometime before you die. There is no option here. The twice-baked croissant makes me masticate just thinking about it. The tea cakes are om-nom-arrific. The French macarons are excellent. However, Amelie's commits a major cardinal sin here that I simply can't avoid writing about: THEY LEAVE THE FRENCH MACARONS IN THE FRIDGE ALL DAY, MAKING THEM HARD AND CRUNCHY. I mean, seriously, who the FUCK decided this was a good idea?! Have they never had real macarons before?! Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Aubrey, not *everybody* knows how a macaron should taste.\" That's true, gentle reader, but if you're going to fucking make macarons for people to purchase and consume, you should know how they're stored / kept fresh. Any other way, and you might as well hold your glaring deficiencies out for the world to see. In this case, Amelie's is walking around with a hideous facial birthmark.

Coffee - meh. Ees okay. Not great. The melange riche is burnt-tasting, while the house roast is better, but still thin and bland."}
{"text":"Everything I've had from sweet to savory to coffees has been delicious. Quick service even when busy. The decor and ambiance is perfect."}
{"text":"Best desserts and the place is so cozy and beautifully decorated. Great spot to do some homework or read a book."}
{"text":"Their Spinach Asparagus Leek Soup was amazing. That and a chunk of fresh baguette? Heaven."}
{"text":"Great eclairs, coffee and macaroons ( I'll admit thats all I get because I love it so much.) crowd is a little hippster-y but its ok. Love that they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and I've given it many chances but again today I had a similar experience to my previous ones. Went in to get some assorted desserts to go, for the price of everything you would expect much nicer service. When placing my to go order - No eye contact, and just seeming overly annoyed that he's waiting on people and forgot asking a question about something, you get a huh, and half answer. Then they just slide the box down to the cashier who also has no eye contact and has to re-open the box to see what's in it and sticks her finger accidentally in the $4 eclair I just bought. no apology or offer to change out and no thank you. Sadly it's the same attitude I get every time I've come in. 
Get your service in line with your prices..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. You can bring a laptop and do work here as there are couches and tables all around. Coffee is good. There is room for improvement in the pastry and food department."}
{"text":"I really wanna really like this place but everytime I go there is always loaded of people there. The price for macaroons are making it hard for me to like them. I know it doesn't cost much to make it and the stuff can be NICER BUT THEY AREN'T so it's hard to like this place. They see us as $$$ or annoying customer that ask for loaded stuff. They only reason this place is the hot spot right now is because theirs no other's 24/7 bakery near by or in Charlotte period. $2:30 for one.macroons is just too high."}
{"text":"The original Amelie's so near and dear to my heart, but I totally understand why they have opened other locations in the Charlotte and surrounding area.  This South Charlotte location used to be another place (near and dear to me) called Midtown Sundries, but alas...\"nothing can last forever\" right?

The great thing about the Amelie's in Pineville is the space... tons of it.  I know the original NoDa location is a bit cramped, but in a charming way.  It always feels like a small victory if you manage to get through the line and find a table to enjoy your treats at... but here in Pineville, there is no shortage of tables and chairs.  There's a faeu wall to break up the expansive space... otherwise the space would be a giant rectangle.  And it looks like they've anticipated where a line would form (if it ever got that busy) since the display cabinet is located in the back and the line forms on the left wall going through.

Same Amelie's decor everywhere... the blue stripes on the wall and a large map of Paris make the space reminiscent of their original location.

Staff and servers are just as friendly here... though they do seem a little more relaxed.  On the two occasions I have been here there haven't been that many people at the location so the servers aren't running around like crazy.

One thing to note is the outdoor patio and a couple tables off to the side... There are a couple of trees out there on the side of the shopping center, but makes for a hot place to sit since the sun beats down on the patio."}
{"text":"A friend who was visit from Idaho and I went to Amelie's after dinner and found it to be a very popular place.

My friend kept taking pictures of all of the decor...especially the chandeliers made out of kitchen items.  She couldn't believe a place like this existed in Charlotte and was open 24 hours.  I've lived in Charlotte for 18 years and have seen it come a long way and this is a nice addition to the city.

On a previous visit. I had a peach tart which was very good.  This visit, my friend and I decided to try the highly recommended Salted Caramel Brownie and a pear torte.  The brownie lived up to its reputation.  The sweet and saltiness of it made you want to savor it for days.

The pear torte was fabulous as well.  We didn't get coffee but my next visit I'll have to try it.

Besides the desserts, the best thing about this place is the funkiness of the decor - all the old and unique furniture and its a great place to people watch.  There was a steady stream of people through the door!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Thanks to the NYT \"36 Hours in Charlotte\" Amelie's was a highlight of my weekend in CLT.  I tried the asparagus and leek soup and an open face sandwich, and then made sure to save room for a salted caramel brownie.  Everything was delicious.  The place is so cute too. I also appreciated that I got a refill on my ice tea.  I wish there was an Amelie's in NYC so I could frequent it!

Service wasn't overly friendly....but the food was great and the place was so adorable, I didn't care."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the food. I ordered a piece of their whole cake which has strawberry filling. My cake was INCREDIBLY dry. $4.50 wasted. The frosting was in a clunk, I poked it to try and it just fell straight off the cake. Seriously for this price, I was expecting much more. I am not sure if all cakes made at Amelie are this dry, because my friend said she tried a piece of the strawberry round cake and it was also very dry.

The blueberry and lavender cold drink was good, but it was just crushed blueberry with sugared water. $3. Free wifi here, a lot of space and the upper floor can be rented out for an event. Outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for breakfast because I heard good things about the place.

I ordered the pecan sticky bun, because it looked delicious.  It tasted, however, terrible.  It was hard like a rock, not like a sticky bun ought to be.  I had to ask for another one, and the lady realized all the other buns were hard too, so she had to take it back to microwave it to soften it.  Didn't help too much.

The chocolate croissant tasted like chocolate bread.  NOT a croissant.  Bread.

The apple turnover was decent - it had some crispy texture to it with an ok filling.  McDonald's makes better apple pies.

The twice baked croissant with almonds was pretty good - probably the best thing I tried that morning.  

Salted caramel brownie was very dense.  It had good flavor, but there's no way I could eat an entire thing, or even half of one, in one sitting.  Maybe I just don't get the salted caramel craze.

At least the coffee was pretty good.  And you get a free refill.  A little bit of redemption there.

I'm just not sure why this place has such great ratings.  Some may say decor, environment, convenience of it being 24 hours, etc.  But if the food is no good, why should any of that other stuff matter?  Just go to Waffle House.  It's cheaper there."}
{"text":"Yum!  The hardest part is figuring out what to get.  The chocolate eclairs, apple tarts, and I don't even know the names of all the pastries I've gotten are soooo good.  They make good latte and cappuccino also."}
{"text":"This is the cutest cafe! The space is huge with tables and couches everywhere. It is nicely decorated with French decor and patterns. It's definitely a place where you can catch up with friends and just talk all day or maybe even a dessert place after a date. I went around 7pm on a Friday, so it wasn't crazy at all. They have French pastries and desserts, coffee, alcoholic beverages, and a small food menu. BF and I got two desserts, mines was the chocolate mousse it was delicious. We sat there for an hour just eating our desserts and talking. It was super quiet with students studying around us or playing board games."}
{"text":"Best cafe in Charlotte ...Great food..gorgeous ambience...and the French sodas..."}
{"text":"FROZEN baked goods? The lady in front of me asked for something that was out of stock in the display, so the counter person said they could go check in the freezer for more...come on. This is supposed to be one of the better bakeries in charlotte, and they are serving frozen baked goods. That is a big no no. I've been here a couple of times now, and this time I came on a Tuesday around 12pm. 
I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a turkey sandwich... I have never been extremely impressed by Amelie's. Seems like it is a bunch of bells and whistles."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this 5 stars....  service. My goodness the pasteries were delicious and the sandwiches were great too, but there is one woman who works the front that is on the ball. The male cashier that rang us up was sitting down and very disinterested. Our coffe order left much to be desired too. It would be nice if there was more ecoutrements at the coffee station and raw sugar and nutmeg would be great. It is a great opportunity to see a professional pastry kitchen in full swing, there are giant plate glass windows to the kitchen for people to watch the chefs in action. Loved this! I highly recommend the napoleon for a sweet tooth. They are the best I've had in a very long time! This is a \"must go to\" if your in charlotte! I wonder if they ship to Texas? We don't have any french pastry shops in Central Texas."}
{"text":"I love the NoDa location because of hours & quirky atmosphere.  Carmel Commons unit needs to find its own type of quirkiness... it's way to plain Jane.  I would eat a Salted Carmel brownie every day from there if I could!"}
{"text":"Good sweets as always but I scratch my head at the service today.  They are nice and friendly at the counter.  However today I asked for a latte and asked for Splenda.  They told me that was available for me to add and I asked that if I got a few packs could they add it while making it .  They said no.  First time I have ever had that at a coffee counter.   I cancelled my coffee order. There was no line behind me so I'm not sure what was going on. My wife enjoyed the brownie she got."}
{"text":"This quaint little bakery reminds of something straight out of France. It's so unique. Every time I go in I see something new. I love their breakfast sandwiches. Their pastries are some of the best I've ever had! Especially the macaroons. It's perfect for all hours of the day. Whether early morning coffee, brunch, lunch, afternoon snack, or dinner and a drink polished off with dessert! I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"The pastries and desserts (especially the macaroons and salted Carmel brownies) are incredible. 
The atmosphere is really the stand out as it provides uptown with a real \"hangout\" spot. It's such a good chill environment and the kind of change uptown needs. 
If there's any complaints it's that the lines take forever and the beer selection needs to be better and include local."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places in Charlotte. This place is absolutely incredible. Amelie's has managed to convince me, many times, to not move away from Charlotte. The food is incredible- we go there for breakfast often. It is open 24 hours and has a great energy."}
{"text":"Salted Caramel Cafe Mocha was perfectly made and the blueberry cream cheese muffin was excellent. Long line but it moved very quickly. My wife and I were both very impressed!"}
{"text":"Back in June (or whenever the hell my second week of vacation was for the year), I went to go see my big sis in Charlotte.  When I was there, she kept telling me about this bakery I just had to try.  Nestled in the NoDa district (hipster central), we went to Amelie's, a 24 hour French bakery/hangout.

Now, my sister is fluent in French, and I used to live (and cook!) there.  When it comes to all things French, I can be pretty critical of it (kind of like the same way I am with steaks).  So, we decided to go.  She had been before, and she enjoyed it- but told me there are times when the line can be out the door.  

When you pull up, it looks like it is in a strip mall of warehouses (new or old, I have no idea).  When you walk in, you are what seems to be you immersed in pop culture.  I would like to think of it as if Andy Warhol designed the place.  There is a counter with all of the pastries and desserts, and a chalked menu of everything else.  I noticed the seating is interesting, as there are no two tables alike- and it seems there are as many couches as there are seats.  

My first visit, I ordered the croque monsieur and a cream soda.  Sis got some kid sized stuff- I asked her if that was all she was getting?   We sat at one of the tables near the door.  As we were waiting, I kept getting the signature dirty looks.  If anyone wanted to start some shit, I was ready!

The food then came out.  It was pretty decent, with the flavors of cheese and Dijon adding to it.  I scarfed it, and was wanting more.  But it being a French bakery and all (and the dirty looks I was getting), I decided to just have that.

When I came back in town for Thanksgiving, I brought my best friend with me.  We decided to go back.  This time, it was him, my sister, my year old nephew, and myself.  This time, I was starving, and I was not going to hold back.  

I ordered a croque monsieur again, and a ham sandwich with cheese.  My buddy got some  kind of sandwich, but I don't remember.   I remember at the time, we didn't get a number (for whatever reason), and then I realized everyone else did.  We had 3 sandwiches coming, they better not lose the order!

We sat at a table in the back, with a couch and 2 chairs.  I was playing with my nephew as his face was covered in chocolate (sis got eclairs).  My sis took him outside for a few to get some air.  We were waiting a few, and then I thought I saw our food come out, and the runner you could tell was baffled, as there was no number.  

She then ran another order of food, and then I got her attention- \"I think those were our sandwiches\".  The funny thing is, we never got a receipt either, so it was a matter of faith.  Our food then came out.

This time, the croque was very flaky, and not like in a buttery flaky way, but like \"god damn, I need water after every bite\" flaky.  I washed it down with the other sandwich.  Thankfully the cream soda is sold in pints!

It's cool that this place is open at all hours of the day and is pretty large, but I don't know- I can come here every so once in a while, but that gaffe was kind of a turn off.  All the cashier had to say it was for the big motherfucker in camo and a braves hat.  I can ASSURE I was the only one...

Another thing that irked me was seeing the crème brulee was already bruleed.  The topping gets compromised after sitting there for 3 hours or more, and let's be honest, they aren't making crème brulees every 3 hours...  And if they are, I sincerely apologize.  But like a great cannoli, you fill the shell when you order it.

But hey, what the hell would I know about French cuisine..."}
{"text":"5 stars for the wifi, 5 stars for the eclair, 5 stars for ample working space both indoors & out, 5 stars for friendliness, 5 stars for location, 5 stars for having beer and wine, I haven't tried the tartines yet but I'll just go ahead and guess those deserve 5 stars too.  Thank you, Amelie's for letting me have 4 incredibly productive and tasty hours in your café.  Cheers to many more!"}
{"text":"Beautiful deserts! Shameful customer service.  I know all of us general public non hipsters are ruining your secret by telling everyone about this place. But you could put a little more effort into a smile, a thank you, a simple you're welcome goes a long way. I shouldn't be the one saying it first. With such an outstanding plethora of deserts you'd think some of that sweetness would rub off on the staff too. 

Yes the desserts are magazine quality and I'm sure the food is too but the coffee had a lot to be desired. The roast they use is not one I would choose and tastes like a medium roast. Espresso drinks in my opinion should be a dark roast. But maybe that's how they do it in France? I'll pass on the coffee next time. 

Oh and another tip don't sit in the hallway, the line will overtake you and takes away from the dining experience. Also you'll be bombarded with constant bags and butts brushing your chair."}
{"text":"I came here to try the sweets when my boyfriend and I were visiting Charlotte on the recommendation of my sister and one of my good friends. When they were first telling me about it, I felt betrayed by my sister for never taking me here while she was in school in Charlotte. So when my boyfriend had an interview in Charlotte, visiting Amelie's was at the top of my list.

I definitely wasn't disappointed! They have a delicious assortment of bakery treats to choose from, and nothing I tasted disappointed me at all. I even took some macarons and tarts to take home for my family.

They also have really great coffees and teas. I wished I could have tasted them all.

Out of all the reasons to live in Charlotte, Amelie's would have been my primary reason to move there."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Yummy pastries, and a really cool space to just chill in (saw a couple people just sitting around playing board games, sipping on coffee and eating pastries). It's easy to see why it's so popular, and at least the line moved quickly when we were there. By far my favorite was the salted caramel brownie!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that I have another convenient location to visit for Amelie's! 

As always the decor is fresh, French and fabulous.  Big enough that you don't feel crowded and plenty of space to spread out.  As always, seats and plug spaces are at a premium for people who like to work in coffee shops!

I tried the Café marcotte?  I'm not sure if that's the exact spelling, but the punch of espresso mellowed with the caramel and sea salt was delicious.  

Can wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"What a great place & open 24 hours!  I love the salted caramel brownie, but for crispy, buttery goodness try the Palmiere.  The Tea Cakes are a moist mouthful if you want something light.  Their Hot Chocolate isn't so great & they don't seem to know how to adjust the amount if you don't want whipped cream.  Other than that it's just a fun & eclectic place with great desserts."}
{"text":"I was very excited that Amelies planned to come uptown and they haven't disappointed.

The space is just as eclectic and fun to be in as the original.  The food is delicious and fresh!
I love that they added computer tables and lots of plug-ins.  I also love the large bar.  You can sit their and order food and drink as well.  They have a great electronic tracking system for them to find you and deliver your food, but you have to hang around and listen for them to yell your name for drinks.  They should get a pa system or electronic board for that.

Parking is horrible and expensive, so unless you have other reasons to be uptown, it's a toss up whether an extra $10-20 to park for a couple of hours is worth it.

Of course, it's a great option and spot for our Queen City employees and visitors so I'm very happy Amelies is there. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"A 24 hour bakery, who could ask for anything more?  I finally went, and got one of almost everything...lol.  The desserts are great, the croissants were amazing better than I thought they would be.  So I enjoyed the food and the pastries very much, and the tea as well.  I wasn't impressed with the staff, not friendly at all was more into what they had going on then helping the customers.  It was plenty of staff, just not so nice attitudes, I'm trying to figure out if the food is worth going back for?"}
{"text":"When I first walked into this café, I was charmed by all the cute, French-inspired décor around the café. I loved how there was ample seating in the shop for large groups of people to talk and socialize. They have a wide selection of pastries, as well as regular food.

 I got an apple tart and peach tart since they looked really good in the case. I paid around $10 for both tarts, and was unfortunately disappointed by their taste. While the apple tart tasted fine, it was slightly hard and stale. I couldn't even eat 1/3 of the peach tart since the flavor was just off, and it was also hard and stale.

I heard their other dishes and pastries were better, so I probably just had bad luck with the apple and peach tarts. Might be back to try their other items!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit family in Charlotte, stopping by Amélie's is a must! The macaroons are delish! Pistachio was my fave, despite the fact that it kind of turned my teeth green. The crème brûlée was amazing! The custard was so creamy & not overly sweet. My sister is addicted to the salted caramel brownies. I'm not a fan of it though. It's good but just a tad bit too sweet for me. The coffee is great, the employees are so friendly, the sweets are awesome, & they're open 24/7! Yes! 24/7! Can't get any better than that! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"6/8/12

All that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...

We came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.  

Since Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)

As for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.

Yes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!

p.s.  Amelie's is open 24/7!"}
{"text":"If I wrote a review for Amelie's it would literally be five pages long. They have been there for all of the important events in my life-- birthday celebrations, first dates, first kisses, study time, you name it. Open 24 hours with DELICIOUS coffee and pastries, I can never get enough of them. They are amazing, and I am so happy they're expanding!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, it was first introduced to me by my best friend when I came to UNCC for school. New to the area, I wanted to explore what Charlotte had to offer; she took me here. I instantly fell in love with the eclectic furniture and the smell of pastries baking in the back of the store.

The prices are fairly decent, service is great and the pastries? Delicious! You can't beat their famous salted caramel brownies, their delectable chocolate mousse cups with strawberries, and you won't find any other heavenly eclaires like they have. It's also a great place to study! I've gone there many a time with my iPad or laptop and sat there doing school work-- why not? It's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and I'm a student! :)"}
{"text":"Ever have a bite of food so stupidly delicious that you can't find words to describe the bite? That's how I feel trying to describe my lunch at Amelie's on Monday. I ordered the turkey and Brie sandwich on a baguette with a seasonal compote and cucumber salad. I also took some desserts to go, including a salted caramel brownie, pistachio petit four, and some mini chocolate raspberry bites. 

Everything was amazing, from service to food. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic bakery! Lines are long here and for good reason. Nice interior and the desserts are fantastic. Worth it to stop in if you are ever in the Charlotte area. A lot of UNCC students stop here."}
{"text":"Amazing bakery/cafe/coffee spot downtown right by the convention center. Very cute & cozy ambience. Loved the open concept of the bakery kitchen where you can watch all of the delicious baked goods being freshly made from scratch. Excellent service every time- I came here everyday of my convention and was able to try both breakfast & lunch. I love that you can get breakfast all day with the exception of their oatmeal which is only offered until 10:30am. I LOVED the raspberry compote that came with the oatmeal- DELICIOUS! Their soups, salads and sandwiches were also heavenly! Perhaps the most light and flakey croissant I've ever eaten! While I didn't personally eat any of their pastries, I did buy a dozen to take back to the convention center for the Team. I got a variety of honey buns, eclairs, turnovers and cinnamon twists. They were a HIT and everything was eaten in a matter of minutes! Would definitely come back the next time I'm in town. Was a great place to quietly work, have a business luncheon or meet with friends. Was a large space so great for groups especially Team meetings away from the convention hall."}
{"text":"there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. it's always always busy, so expect to wait a lil bit. most everything i've had here is delicious, so you can't go wrong. this is prob the best place to get dessert late night, as it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pastries are a little over-rated and over priced. But the macaroons are the only reason I visit this place and keep me coming back"}
{"text":"Amelie's is an amazing French bakery with a vast assortment of pastries, breakfast items, and coffee.  They easily beat out any French bakery in Raleigh, and I knew I had to bring home as many treats as I could.  For breakfast, I had the twice baked almond croissant.  It was so crunchy on the outside, yet so buttery and soft on the inside; it was twice baked perfectly and easily one of the best croissants I've had.  I also got a latte, and it was very strong.  I love the design they put on top of it as well, a very elegant presentation. 

I also tried the apple and strawberry kiwi fruit tarts.  Both were really good and the French cream was so smooth.  The salted caramel brownie was also amazing.  Salty and sweet, gooey and crunchy, everything you would want in a dessert.  The chocolate filled éclair and cream puffs were also classics, can't go wrong with either.  The chocolate mousse torte was also decadently smooth and rich with cocoa flavor.

Overall, everything I tried was really good.  You can't go wrong with any of their pastries and desserts.  Amelie's is an absolute must every time I go to Charlotte now."}
{"text":"Friends and I decided to hang out in NODA at 36th Street, as we sat in the atrium we decided to go to Amelie's French Bakery from the atrium, we thought great no lines, NOT, the line was out the door, I love the treats and the she crab soup, awesome 24 hours, bring your laptop.  If you are on a diet, leave it at the DOOR."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours hell yes! 
Came in at 230 in the morning. Nothing was out of stock. I came in a got 4 salted caramel macarons, one was free because it was mushed in (shout out to the girl for giving it to me free), salted caramel brownie and a turkey and bacon sandwich. 

Salted caramel macarons were great. Made just right! 
I kinda wish the caramel on the salted caramel brownie wasn't so sticky...but the deliciousness of it cancelled it out ahaha 

The turkey and bacon sandwich was amazing!!! Imperfect for a midnight snack :) 

Staff very friend even at 230 in the morning. 

The scene is very nice. Paris themed of course. Very welcoming and friendly. 

Will come back when I visit Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"The Yelp rating brought us here. The experience and the food will keep us away. This place is definitely overrated, and an absolute fraud of a \"french bakery/cafe.\" 

Entering the restaurant, you feel a darkness that does not match the mood of Paris at all! The hodge-podge of furniture and items meant to be eclectic parisian trinkets, seem displaced in an undefined space that isn't warm and doesn't have ambience. 

I was especially disappointed that the pastries- which they should perfect as a core competency- were truly disappointing. Every croissant was crispy! We ordered 6! 

Worst of all, the option of spinach on the breakfast sandwich-is actually dried frozen spinach! 

The one good thing I had was a Layered Latte, and it was delicious! For that, I give it a star. 

Needless to say, I won't be back; but truly hope the owner(s) of this place will have a real Parisian experience and  revamp this attempt at offering one!"}
{"text":"Delicious is the best way to describe Amelie's. I first tried Amelie's through a co-worker that brought treats and was blown away by the salted caramel brownies. I decided to go for myself and tried a couple items. Everything was tasty and it was a great environment. Will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Really love the charm of this place! Warm, inviting, bohemian little seating arrangements and french provincial armchairs make me wish I was a student again so I could come and drink coffee and study here for hours.  I was there on a monday night and still couldnt secure a seat anywhere that I could even faintly hear the live music.  They should have a few smaller and easier to move chairs in there so people could actually sit.  They directed me towards the hallway or atrium I guess they call it?  But I didn't show up to sit in the atrium.  Probably won't go very often because of the seating problem, if you cant sit on a monday night there is little hope for any others.  The cake I had was Meh.  It was one of those that I thought had actual frosting that turned out to be that glorified whipped cream.  But it is a total charmer and worth going  once."}
{"text":"The thing I love most about Amelie's is that they are open 24/7/365.  No matter the day or time, the atmosphere is always bustling and very eclectic. During busy times the parking lot is a nightmare, and the line at the pastry case winds through the back of the restaurant. The food is generally good, albeit a tad pricey. I used to be a regular latte drinker here, but after a couple of months of inconsistency and slow service early in the morning I found a new coffee shop. The Noda location is one of a kind. In true Noda fashion it's a bit grungy, but I suppose that's part of the allure.  Other Amelie's locations feel like a completely different concept--stuffy and sterile--and cater to a completely different clientele. This is a fun place to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"Amazing to find a 24 hr cafe serving up sweets, coffees, and sandwiches! This is rare when I've only ever found Ihop and Walmart's to be 24 hr stores. 4 stars for hours and selection. The actual confectioneries though were unmemorable.

Mini Peach Tart - best dessert of the lot, not too sweet yet satisfies.
Napoleon - frozen cream, beautiful, delicate pastry
Salted Caramel Brownie - incredibly dense, one bite is enough!
Petit Gâteau chocolate - thick frosting with unmemorable chocolate cake
Éclair - fine, if you're about eclairs
Petit Fours - pistachio, chocolate peanut butter (x2), lemon, tasty if you're looking for a one bite dessert
Mixed berry, strawberry, chocolate cinnamon macarons - only the mixed berry was fresh at the time, the strawberry and chocolate cinnamon were stale.

Quick service, nice people, only fresh juice available is lemonade, the rest is store bought. Lovely indoor and outdoor seating. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Amelie's in NoDa and Rock Hill..but the Uptown location leaves me wishing it was better. I usually order sandwhiches, quiche or soup. I have not had the desserts at this location and although they look scrumptiously sweet and pretty... many seem covered in a gelatin glaze....that doesnt appeal to me. Please stop finishing your tarts with glaze...fresh fruit is fine. Others love it, so try it if u want. 

Today, my broccoli and cheddar quiche was \"overheated\"...and burnt. Not sure why they didn't chop the broccoli into smaller pieces. My asparagus, leek soup was fine and its usual watery. I did enjoy my Elderflower Lemonade. Sorry Amelie's Uptown...my meals in Noda and Rock Hill were always fresh. Step it up."}
{"text":"Between the tasty treats and decor....I loved this place.

The first day I went was a bit confusing as I wasn't sure what line to get in, but it all worked out. There were so many pastries to choose from and they all looked so delicious. 

I got the:
- turkey/bacon/cheddar quiche= a bit charred, but very delicious and didn't taste burnt. The crust was crisp and flaky, the egg base fluffy. 
- lemon tea cake = chewy and moist with a light lemon flavor, which didn't taste artificial.
- pecan pie = wasn't excessively sweet and thick crust.

It was all so good that I returned the following day before my flight. 

The decor was so darn cute! Between the chandelier made of pots and pans, mix-matched furniture, striped walls, the large window where you can watch the bakers...it all felt so inviting, fun and like the kind of place I'd want to spend hours in. 

This a great place for all ages and for all occasions! Between the tables inside, on the lower level and outside...there's ample seating."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant bakery that's been reopened from a previous location downtown.  Great atmosphere and great menu.  Ham and cheddar quiche was barely warm but cream puff was very good.  Service was slow but very pleasant.  So why am I giving it five stars?  Because it's not IHOP, Burger King, Wendy's, or another boring fast food chain restaurant.  It's a great local spot and a refreshing alternative to something other than a fast food place that you can find anywhere.  BTW, the pastries and breads are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Ever since my wife and I got back from Paris last year she can't get enough of this place. The macaroons are identical in taste and quality to what we had there. A definite must try if you've never had them before. The chocolate eclairs are also very good and aren't overly sweet and heavy like some can be. As many have commented already the Carmel brownie is excellent!  The brownie consistency is a bit more dense than what in was expecting but it really worked well with the Carmel. Their drinks are pretty stellar as well. Try the lemonade, you won't be disappointed. 

It's also good to know that they are open 24 hours. This may come in handy if you have a wife that's pregnant or you are fat like me and wake up dreaming of delicious deserts!  Mmmmmm brownies..."}
{"text":"It may have the name and flair of a French bakery, but its far from it. I ordered a egg and cheese croissant and it was nasty. Super oily and greasy and can't taste the butteriness of the croissant. Their desserts and coffee aren't that great either. There are plenty other great coffee shops with better coffee and better breakfast options. This place is a huge disappointment and would not recommend going here. Go someplace where there are better options for coffee, desserts and breakfast."}
{"text":"Cuteeeeeee Cafe. Open 24hours. Visiting in town with some friends , we just weren't ready to go home yet . So we swung by the cafe - adored the pastries and got a few drinks. I tried the French salted Carmel soda. It tasted like cream soda but i wasn't upset. Came back the very next night with some friends. My husband said it was the best blueberry muffin he ever had. He ordered one to take back to the hotel lol"}
{"text":"Could have just been a busy night but I was not impressed. Good pastries though. Had a hard time with seating."}
{"text":"As a newcomer to Charlotte, exploring can be an adventure, a hazard, and sometimes both. But every once in a while, you hit the jackpot. You walk into a place and as soon as you do, you think to yourself, there is some awesome shit going on here. And y'know? That gut instinct was right.
First off - the decour in this place is a-mazing. Extremely eclectic, while being chic, hilarious, hipster and interesting at the same time. I don't know how many times I pointed at things that I just wanted to up and take home with me. 

STAFF: No complaints on my end, but I'm a pretty easy person to please. However, one person I was with was miffed to learn that they only used whole milk or soy to make lattes, no skim or inbetweensies. Another friend I was with is very specific in what she gets - coffee, iced, half cream/half 2%. Not only did they not have 2%, but using cream was 'against the rules', which I'm not even sure the meaning of on that one. I had no problems, though.

FOOD: Breakfast sandwiches are absolutely incredible. Sausage, egg, tomato, gruyer on a croissant. Not to mention it's huge. It was all flaky, warm and delicious. Other breakfast sandwich experiences were the same from people in my party - all to die for. 
Picked up a couple of tarts, as well. The raspberry lemon tart is not only gorgeous, but absolutely delicious. Picked up another tart that was chocolate ganache with raspberry preserves, but it was a little too sweet for my taste. 
I got to sample the lemon tea cake as well, and though a little pricy, I would definitely pick up some for a tea party (being a huge tea aficionado in the first place).

Coupled with the free wifi, and comfortable and plentiful seating, I'm definitely on the Amelie bandwagon. This is a great place to take anyone for coffee.... and other delicious things!"}
{"text":"\"too sexy for Milan, too sexy for New York and Japan\"

That old 80's song pops into my head every time I walk into this place. It's so hip it hurts. It's been riding the wave for several years, based solely on being the only \"French\" cafe in town, not counting Cafe Monte, another faux French establishment. It's also located in a \"very edgy\" part of town, meaning there are non-white people on the streets.

The coffee and pastries are nothing special. You'd think they were ambrosial given some of the reviews but you can get better at Whole Foods. Even so, I'd still make the drive, except for the abysmal service, as it does make a nice change from the claustrophobic suburban paradise that is Charlotte. 

It can take them upwards of 30 minutes to make a sandwich. Heaven forbid that you should ask that your pastries be boxed, rather than crammed into a bag. Yes, you say, but it's a French bakery, doesn't the attitude go with it? Frankly, no. I've been to French patisseries, in France, in US and European cities. I've yet to encounter the attitude I've experienced at Amelie's.

Go if you are bored out of your mind, as it is open 24/7, but don't make a special trip for the food. It really isn't that special."}
{"text":"I hate that I am having to do this. I have been so excited about Amelie's coming to south Charlotte for months. I went yesterday for some iced coffee and was totally unimpressed. The decor is cool but, not as eclectic as NoDa. The staff and barista treated me like \"just another customer\" (something I never feel at Starbucks.) The whole restaurant smelled of wet paint. I realize it just opened but, come on. When I went to the condiments station the trash can was filthy with food particles on the receptacle. Really quite disgusting. I was also shocked to see piles of dirty dishes on a trolly in the middle of the restaurant, right next to where you doctor up your coffee. Really gross. Hope they work out some of these things. I am willing to give it another try because, well, the coffee is delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here as a college student, eating pastries and doing school work either by myself or bringing other classmates. However, recently I've noticed the inconsistency of food quality. For the past couple months, every item I've purchased has tasted like it's been in the fridge all day.... So when I ate it it was either dry, hard, or both. I think this is my last time coming to this location. I'm hoping the one they're building uptown will taste as good as the Noda location used to, if not... the company has lost a customer entirely."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is sold as French and cozy but then you get handed a boring white cup with lid and a boring plastic plate. The walls have neat lamps, chandeliers, curtains and art everywhere you look. Their chairs don't match (which I dig) but then you get a boring cup.

Oh well. 
Guess who was looking forward to a bulky weird special cup? This girl 

The chai and chocolate croissant was good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Amelie's! I haven't met a pastry, sandwich, salad, soup or coffee I haven't liked. 
My friends and I normally meet once every 1-2 weeks and we are able to hang out and talk and enjoy each other. The staff is TOPS! They're so friendly and great at offering suggestions on whats the best. Being open 24 hours makes it all the more better- any other bakery or coffee shop we end up getting swept out the door- but not at Amelie's. The location of Amelie's is NODA which is known for the art atmosphere and \"free-spirited\" people- I'm sorry if some are \"weirded out\", but you need to realize what part of town you're in- if you're not for that head to South Park."}
{"text":"The chicken salad tastes divine on a croissant. I'm hooked. 

Caveat: there have been issues with wi-fi not working a few times."}
{"text":"WOW. 

what a diamond in the rough

the inside is quirky and fun, the baked good omg the baked goods! the salted caramel brownie still has me drooling a bit

the houseblend coffee was really great too

seating can be a bit hard to find so just be prepared or go outside to the atrium ( its covered) and grab a table"}
{"text":"From a distant land of NY I come to this establishment, all for tiramisu. As I approach the delectable sweets I ask for my prize and yet, nothing is delivered. I am told, this is a 'fwench bakewy' and the most desired dessert is not within the walls of this cluttered palace of Knick knacks and oddly positioned tables. My head hangs dejectedly. My life is at a standstill. I must return to my land of NY tomorrow without a whisper of that layered dessert my heart yearns for. All because... this is a 'fwench bakewy'."}
{"text":"The best.  Just go here, it is the best.  My whole review was going to say, \"the best.\", but yelp wants more characters, so the rest is a filler.  It's the best."}
{"text":"Eclectic and  yummy.You can seat and work, surf, or play a board game over wonderful food and drink.The place is a little off the beaten track, just east of Up Town, but definitely worth the drive! It's open all the time and they're always baking something fresh!"}
{"text":"Great pastries, quiches, and all kinds of amazing goodies. The chai tea latte is also divone"}
{"text":"They have a huge choice for desserts. Perfect place for a nice cup of coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Love the salted caramel brownie of course and the coffee always hits the spot. Service is always very friendly and you can't beat the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really cute atmosphere for a coffee or study date. Brownies are legendary, service is always friendly, and the art throughout the building is super cozy and beautiful"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to. It's open 24 hours and it has a little bit of everything. Sandwiches, pastries, salads, all sorts of drinks etc. They also have great customer service. Emily F is one of the great employees that this location has. She's always happy and ready to serve the customer. I highly recommend you visit."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Loved my visit there! 

You may have to endure a wait but it's worth it. The pastries we ordered were the carmel brownies, the fruit turnover and the fruit pecan pie tarts. I didn't get to eat the turnover, my SO ate that one so I can't comment. I had a bite of these cute little fruit pecan pie tarts and I wanted more. Too bad my SO ate the whole thing. So I got back up and went back in line, only to find out they had sold out!! :( I got the pecan pie tarts instead. They were just as tasty. I didn't like the caramel brownies as much. Maybe a bit too sweet and sticks to my teeth. But it is a prize winner, so you have to try for yourself! 

We also tried the pate sandwich in french bread and the turkey club sandwich in croissant. Both sandwiches were good but I preferred the pate. And if given the choice I would probably just eat all the tarts and skip the sandwiches. 

Coffee was good and a must have if you are eating the caramel brownies! :) 

We enjoyed the unique decor and just being able to sit there and enjoy each other's company in this cute little store."}
{"text":"Love the new space! All the desserts are very tasty, but the salted caramel brownie is just amazing! Wish the food menu was a little more veggie friendly. The baguettes and spreads on the catering menu are fantastic; wish they were available to regular customers!"}
{"text":"I take all my visitors from out of town here. Every time I'm at Amelie's I get the berry tart. Eclairs and macaroons are also equally delicious. Fun fact- Amelie's made the desserts shown on the train in the first Hunger Games movie!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast sandwiches - get them on a baguette! I also split the macarons with my friend - pistachio was my favorite, and the pumpkin macaron was excellent. The food is excellently prepared, the service is great, and the atmosphere is tres French. Lots of seating. Even if there's a long line, it moves pretty fast."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while and I must say the chicken salad on the croissant is Simply Delicious. I also loved the crepe madame and to top it off I get a salted caramel brownie and I feel that I am simply in heaven. I haven't gone up this location I'm usually at the one in noda. I've tired other pastries but I always lean to the caramel brownie it's my all-time favorite"}
{"text":"All I can say is the salted carmel brownie. Everything I've ordered has been good. From the croque monsieur to the chicken salad and my daughter loved the onion soup. They also have a great coffee section."}
{"text":"What must I say about this place I've been eating here for years that's the first thing I want to say and I'm never disappointed. It's such a delightful French style Bakery with amazing pastries and tasty sandwiches. The  croque monsieur is one of the best I've ever had, and their chicken salad on a fresh croissant I've had many of times for lunch and  It's really enjoyable. However a visit to Amelie's for me always include ending my meal with a salted caramel brownie decadence on another level. The  Amelie's in Noda stays open 24 hours and I have utilized those hours many of times so I suggest that you go and discover what you like. From French coffees, to delicious pastries and sandwiches breakfast and lunch are both great times to go. If it's your first time going it can be overwhelming the pastries of many different assortment that's in the case can be mind-blowing. I suggest you take a deep breath look at all the choices before you start to order the staff is friendly and very accommodating they very knowledgeable about the delicious food that they serve. Don't be shy to ask."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable. I've been meaning to give it a try and finally got the chance last weekend. My sister and I shared a sausage egg gruyere breakfast sandwich on a baguette along with an almond milk latte! Both were delicious.
The pastries were the standout though. There are so many options! The pecan pie was delicious. 
The location itself also extends pretty far back. There's lots of seating and many quiet corners that would be great for studying. Definitely going to head back and try some more pastries!"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts...late night hours...adorable establishment...friendly service.  What more can one ask for?!?!  It was my first visit to Amelie's, but won't be my last."}
{"text":"I love going to amelies especially after a nite out with friends. The Noda location is open 24 hours but the park road location is awesome too and open late. My favorite treats are macaroons and salted caramel brownies!"}
{"text":"So many gluten free options for a bakery, which I am not used to! I had a breakfast sandwich on gluten free bread, most of the macarons are gluten free (all except one flavor), they have a gluten free caramel brownie, gluten free almond tea cakes (I tried a free sample and it was AMAZING), and a few other things as well. I would back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"What can I say? Amelie's is amazing. Their deserts and coffees are mouth watering. They are open 24 hours so you can get an Amelie's fix any time you want! The chocolate ganache is amazing and their tarts are the best in the city! Check them out and you will be hooked. The place has a very fun and quirky atmosphere that gives you that French cafe feeling. Beautiful fun place!"}
{"text":"What a great place for a late night bite- or mid-afternoon sugar craving! Nice college-like ambiance - cute little tables, mismatched chairs, games available to play- people reading,studying, talking etc. 


The food was great- I had a leek soup and a croissant sandwich with Havarti cheese (killer!) ...and the dessert well - equally amazing ! Priced right - the only complaint is that it can be tough to find a seat...and if you do find one where people are studying- you feel a little uncomfortable talking."}
{"text":"If you're needing a treat and some divine coffee, this is your place. The ambience is so unique and it's always filled with people. They're doing something right!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast and ordered a simple sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. 

Except...it wasn't simple. It was awesome!

Really, really cool bakery. I recommend this to anyone. 

Look forward to hopefully going back some day."}
{"text":"Love Amelies! This is a must-see for any of my family or friends that come into town. Not only for the treats but during the fall, they have some of the best soups around. And lately, I've been a sucker for soups. On my first trip, I did the have the famed salty brownie, but I probably had too much excitement built up because I just didn't \"get it\". But, nonetheless, I encourage you to venture out and try a variety of things on the menu. It's a 24 hour party in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I've been to other location but found the new one while staying in nearby SouthPark waiting out Hurricane Irma. And, of course, Amelie's never disappoints!

The location is behind the shopping center (as an FYI) since the GPS kept taking me to the bakery in the front. There's plenty of parking and this location has lots of seating indoors and outdoors. 

The decor is just as eclectic as the other location and every little detail makes this a magical experience. There are plenty of sweets to choose from and, honestly, I have yet to try anything that I don't like. Of course, I'm more on the fruitier side but I'm sure the chocolatey delicacies are amazing as well. 

Their turkey & brie sandwich is definitely my favorite since it has a homemade seasonal jam. The lemonade is also delicious. I really like that this location has a bar and you can also enjoy drinks there. There's a little bit for everyone to enjoy with family and friends!

I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place!

My aunt recommended this place since she said the ambiance was very cute and the food was great! She was SO RIGHT! As soon as you walk in, you're transported into a different world that is so unique and warm. They have so many different dessert and drink options. And the food was so fresh and delicious.

I tried the turkey and brie and it was absolutely delicious. For dessert, I indulged in an apple pie which was the perfect ending to a great meal! There are plenty of places to sit and I noticed there were several group meetings going on. The place is also open 24 hours! Just perfect!

I look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Carmel brownie is amazing. The uptown location is just as good."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place for desserts/breakfast. You can pretty much find any pastry here that your little heart desires: cream puffs, palmiers, cake, fruit tarts, etc. Or a delicious, fluffy ham and cheddar quiche slice (or in my case, a little of everything)."}
{"text":"My sister and I were excited to see a play and have a girls night out. We chose Amélie's as we have heard nothing short of rave reviews and only had a short time to grab a bite before the show. Everything on the menu sounded delightful and we had a hard time choosing! We finally chose the Croque Monsieur and on of the daily quiches. (broccoli cheddar).  
I'll be honest that I was less than impressed when we received our food. Our quiche looked and tasted as though it had been reheated several times and a piece of cheese was laid across the top to make it appear 'fresh'. 

The Croque Monsieur was lack luster in that the croissant wasn't up to the standards we have heard of. It tasted stale and almost store bought. The ham inside was nothing extraordinary and honestly was on the bland side. However, the mustard had a great flavor but I highly doubt there is any left in the kitchen. It was ALL on the sandwich. 

We are so disappointed in our experience at this location. Totally not expected and for a company that gets rave reviews. I hope that our experience was a fluke and we are willing to try again but it may be a while before that happens."}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm in Paris !!! What great atmosphere and great pastries. This will be my go to spot for an nice evening with my hubby or just to get together with friends. I can't believe I have never known about this spot and we've lived in the area for over four months."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a great French Bakery and Cafe. They have a nice selection of sweets and pastries. We love the eclairs and palmiers. The palmiers are buttery and flaky with the right amount of sweetness. The macarons are also good. They have the right crunch and chewiness, the \"feet\" of the macarons are beautiful. For the fillings, there are a lot of jellies and one had a really soft frosting that was almost like whipped cream, not a lot of the traditional thicker cremes. For years I was spoiled living and working down the street from a 'Lette macaron boutique so I'm picky with macarons. I haven't been able to find decent macarons in Charlotte, so it's nice to know I can go to Amelie's. I had the coconut-passion fruit cake and it was ok. The frosting was too buttery for my liking and didn't have much flavor. That being said, it's just one item out of so many other delicious items. The space is charming and the staff is kind. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Amelie's location. Since it was on the way back home, we decided to \"skip the line\" that is always present at the original location in NoDa and head over this way. It's crammed into the back of a shopping center on Park that has just about everything in it you could ever need or want.

But Amelie's is the focus here. They've got almost everything you can get at the main location and they're probably about the same size inside. They get sufficiently packed here too. I joked with my girlfriend that when a new Amelie's opens the local thrift stores must run out of stock - because they furnish the places with only mix-matched furniture and random paintings. They've got the sandwiches menu, the tea and coffee, the cakes, macarons, tarts, salted caramel brownies, petit fours, etc. etc. On this visit I even saw entire macaron cakes.

Lots of seating. It was a rainy day but there's seating outside for when it's not. And the neighborhood is not as sketchy as NoDa - that's certainly a win in my opinion. Closer to home too. The quality isn't even with all Amelie's locations though. Maybe it's a side effect of being so popular that quality is starting to fall. That's the only reason I can't afford them 5 stars because I otherwise love me some Amelie's."}
{"text":"Of course Amelie's can't go with out a review from a Charlotte denizen. But I won't sugar coat this either, pun so intended.

Amelie's has some great sandwich and bread choices. I like to say that anything on a croissant can't disappoint. I tend to go for the teas because I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't attest to its quality. As for the sweets, I've not always been so happy with them. Some of the more outrageous ones with lots of extras attached are overdoing it in my opinion. And the expensive colorful truffles are not worth it. I guess that's why the case seems to always be full of them. Go for the breads or sandwiches and get the white tea.

The atmosphere and layout along with all the kitschy vintage furniture that looks like it could've come out of anywhere from your grandma's storage shed to Rococo era France is great for mood setting. Then there's the courtyard in the back with all the trees and the skylights. This place is always moving, always has people and is always surprisingly quite relaxed 24/7."}
{"text":"If you want a place that has an eclectic mix of European decor to inspire your internet exploring or sounds of the accordion in the background music setting your mood to read, this is the place for you.  This is a much more laid back take on the coffee shops you may be used to. There is plenty of seating for any number of people. Even as a solo guest you have options of a single chair with a side table or a table seating 6. Do what you want! I haven't even started on the desserts! The pastries, especially the macaroons are amazing! The staff is very friendly and are willing to engage in quality service (which may be a bit different from actual French restaurants). The tea is fantastic! Be sure to add a bit of steamed almond milk to your earl grey."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed in the pastries I got. I visited this place several years back when it was in a much smaller location and thought it was better then. Maybe it feels too commercialized now. The almond croissant was fine. Nothing special. It wasn't warmed, either, and had way too much almond paste in the middle. The macron was cold and hard, not soft and delectable. I couldn't even finish it, and that's not a good sign. The coffee was fine. Also nothing special, dashing my expectation for a delicious cup of French coffee. Went back the next day to try a few more things. The elephant ears had no taste. The tea cake was good. Honestly, Had hoped for more when I walked in given my past experience. It went from quaint good French bakery to giant just OK French bakery."}
{"text":"Another excellent addition to the Park Road shopping center (I seem to start a lot of my reviews like that lately).  

Went to dinner and Burtons and was craving a sweet treat.  Ohhhh the convenience of being able to walk to everything.  

Amelie's is located in the back lot of the shopping center - you have to walk behind Michaels past rock salt and it will be on the left.  There is a cute little patio out back and you walk down the stairs from the patio to get to the entrance.

Ordered a small tart, the salted caramel brownie (if you've never been here, please just get this is mine blowing), and a macaroon.

We checked out and then ordered two glasses of wine at the bar and sat on the patio.  This was a nice night cap to my evening!"}
{"text":"This place is so convenient for working meetings uptown.  Our team loves going here to get out of the office, drink delicious coffee and eat heavenly breakfast sandwiches   

I looooove the bacon,egg, cheese, and spinach on a baguette.  It's so delicious and filling.  

Plus if you are craving a sweet treat the macaroons do not ever disappoint .  

Amelie's also has WiFi and the building is decorated so cute!"}
{"text":"After all the Amelie's hype I've heard, I was a little disappointed when I finally visited. We wanted to pick up some of the infamous salted caramel brownies for family members we were going to visit and needing to eat breakfast too, decided to kill two birds with one stone. 

They do have a very nice patio area Uptown and the inside is decorated very cool. However, I was not impressed with our breakfast. I got the quiche of the day (ham and cheddar) and a cup of the soup of the day (spinach, asparagus and leek). The quiche was not very warm and I couldn't really taste any ham or cheese and the soup was a milk/butter broth with 3 spinach leaves and one carrot floating in it. Boyfriend got the croque monsieur-- which was very tasty-- just not a lot for a $9 sandwich. His summer stew soup was just mediocre as well and none of our meal was very warm. 

The salted caramel brownies though.. those are good. We got two of the salted caramel mochas and a creme brulee french soda as well. The soda was delicious and interesting! Must try! 

I guess people mainly come for the dessert and coffee-- which is what I will be doing from now on."}
{"text":"Very cool, very French hip place with awesome food, but limited menu and full bakery."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Their dessert selection is to die for, and their coffee is great. I ordered a fruit tart and macaroon when I went & they were absolutely delicious. I love the decor and everything, and the fact that the NODA store is open 24hrs is awesome."}
{"text":"For some reason, Amelie's is like a legend in Charlotte. Frankly, I don't know why - probably because it's one of the non-fast-food places that's open 24 hours. Or perhaps it's simply because it's not a chain, when so, so many places in the area are, and you have to respect that.

But while I can appreciate that, and those salted caramel brownies are rather tasty, the place itself isn't all that impressive. There is barely room to navigate up near the counter, and unless you grab your sweet treats to go, you don't have room to hang out if you bring someone along - and after all, why go if you can't tell someone about the place?

To make matters worse, the staff working there isn't the friendliest bunch, perhaps because while there are plenty of said sweets to indulge upon, and the salted caramel brownies are legendary in these parts, the rest is a bit ho-hum. Get past them and there isn't much other than a few knick-knacks that could have come from the going-out-of-business sale from Central Perk."}
{"text":"This place is one on Charlottes finest. Great backed goods."}
{"text":"Amelie's is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in Charlotte. I'm a sucker for all baked goods and coffee, and this place is open (and busy) at all hours, so it's a perfect spot after a concert. I've never been here at a time that there wasn't a line stretching the entire building. It's not ideal for someone in a hurry, but if you can afford to wait in line, it's worth it. I've yet to try anything that I didn't like. The tarts are wonderful, and I don't know anywhere else to get French macarons. (I've read other reviews that suggested the French macarons are too tough or hard; mine had a perfectly crisp outer layer and spongy interior.) The eclairs are excellent as well. I love croissants, and these don't disappoint. 

One downside: the price of the pastries and baked goods. A bite-sized tart runs $2.50, and a 4 inch tart is $4.50. Macarons are $2.50 per cookie. 

The coffee and tea are great and very reasonably priced (much cheaper than Starbucks and a little cheaper than many other cafes). The baristas are quick and prepare the coffee well. 

The menu food is decent as well. It's not what I come here for, though. 

The only other negative is that the service is much less friendly than the typical cafe. The employees are so concerned with moving the line quickly that they get snippy if you have a question (especially about flavors or prices of items that aren't labeled). But I suppose if they took time to be friendly, the wait times would be much longer and they'd lose business. For friendly service and a smile, I'll stick with my small local cafes."}
{"text":"The pastries are just ok...

Their pastries used to be much better, but the attention to detail has suffered with their growing popularity. Now it seems like their pastries are quickly mass produced, which is sad because I used to think they were the best bakery in Charlotte. 

The tarts look sad with clumsily plopped on fruit and gelatinous clumps of glace. A lot of their pastries - like croissants, cake, anything with choux, palmiers, etc. are often slightly overdone. Overall, even though most everything tastes ok, it all seems to lack finesse. I'm not expecting Sadaharu Aoki, but a little thoughtfulness can go a long way."}
{"text":"The caramel hot chocolate still remains my favorite but it sucks that these guys don't have any milk options other than whole or soy.
Desserts are good, Salted caramel brownies are TO DIE FOR! These two things would win 5 stars from me, and enough good desserts for my boyfriend's big sweet tooth.
Chai is mediocre, I always run to Smelly Cat or Central Coffee for that, and I struck off one star after I got bad service from a server on Christmas eve. Maybe he was in a bad mood because he had to work that night, but that doesn't mean you mumble when you tell me about the flavors of the bite sized desserts (just label them and make things easier) and when I ask you again, you yell at me."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee and bakery stop! And if you want to stay, the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute!! Restaurant is larger than the other one. Staff helped with all my questions. Everything was so pretty it was hard to decide. I got the chicken salad croissant and it was good. Chicken salad is mayo based and had large chunks of meat. Croissant was flaky and fluffy at the same time."}
{"text":"WOW! A coworker brought me to this place so we could do some strategic planning over breakfast and I was so enamored with it that I could hardly focus. The place is so stinkin' cute! The decor is inviting and quite charming. Lots to look at! The food is very good and the people...oh the people! They were so friendly and helpful! This is the kind of place that you just want to bring your money back to time and time again!"}
{"text":"This was one of the stop for the NC Tour De Food in Charlotte. 

Such a cute bakery.. it is very French-est. yes, I made that word up! The decor is very interesting which make the bakery a very fun place to be in. 

The inside is pretty spacious with 2 floor and another floor for private functions. A very lovely spot for a hot sip of your favorite brew and some sweets! 

As part of the tour, I was able to try the soup (forgive me I don't remember the name!) but it was so good. Very rich and creamy! Also got the try the infamous salted caramel bars. I guess it's famous for a reason!!!!  biting into the bar I thought it would be a HARD caramel but it was so soft and so good! I wish I had time to buy some home but I didn't.

I would recommend out of towners to visit and try some treats there!"}
{"text":"Definitely a dope spot. Just moved to Charlotte from Florida and I love little coffee shops. Well, this wasn't little and it's a bakery, but it's dope AF. It's in the shape of a snail shell. Lots of spots to sit and have a personal chat. But the best part ... it's open all night!! What a sweet nightmare!

I had a latte that had mixed herbs ... LORDT!!! I didn't care that my mouth was burned for almost two weeks after ... and the pastry was amazing. Can't remember what it was called since I was in awe of how pretty it looked... and it tasted just as pretty. 

I also got lucky because I heard the lines are always very long, but nope. I was the 5th customer in line. Great experience!! I'm definitely coming back here again. 

By the way, the wall of locks is such a good touch to the spot!"}
{"text":"I got the full BLT sandwich with the salad as the side. Delicious! The BLT is a pretty basic sandwich, and I'm my opinion pretty hard to mess up, but the fresh bread with just the right amount of crunch and fluffiness makes this sandwich to die for. The vinaigrette for the salad was also really tangy and nice! At first, I didn't order a drink, but the saltiness of the bacon just made me order an iced jasmine green tea. On its own it can be a bit bitter? Strong? I don't know how to describe it, but it's not bad. I just added some honey to it, which was perfect for my liking."}
{"text":"Some of the best deserts in Charlotte, plus since its open late you can crave that sweet tooth appetite at any time. Atmosphere is very eclectic and you are bound to run into some interesting characters."}
{"text":"This place is great, always a wonderful and peaceful experience. I love that they are expanding throughout Charlotte, we need more places just like this!"}
{"text":"5 stars for my Napoleon and coconut macaroons. 

0 stars for the customer service. Some of the pastries aren't labeled and when I asked about a specific one I was told: \"it's just a brownie\". Gee, thanks, pal. The cashier made us feel bad for wanting Seagrams ginger ale instead of Boylans; saying Seagrams had no ginger in it. Also, I asked for extra milk in my cafe au lait only to be asked, \"do you just not want coffee in it?\". I don't get the elitist coffee culture happening. 

Atmosphere is bizarre, the place looks like a modge podge of leftover furniture and arts and crafts projects gone wrong. 

Overall, don't ask questions and get a dessert to go."}
{"text":"Can Amelie's disappoint? Unlikely. Every location I try is fantastic. I am just a huge fan of their late hours. We love to bring friends here after dinner for a sweet treat. Everything is always fabulous from the food to the drinks to the decor. I especially thought the staff here was personable, attentive, and kind! Way to go!"}
{"text":"oK... so why did no one tell me that there is a 24/7 bakery in Charlotte? This is such a great spot to come to after dinner and drinks. They have lots of amazing goodies to try. It might take me years to taste everything they offer! Tip: They have really long lines! But it is worth the wait and it usually moves pretty quickly. The only complaint I have is that its hard to decide when you get up there to order and you feel very rushed because there are so many people behind you. I had the Napoleon-amazing. I also had the vanilla petit cake and the salted caramel brownie. The brownie was my favorite part. They make a good cappuccino which really complements their baked goods. It has a super cute design and lots of seating!"}
{"text":"What I like: it's a great place to bring out of town guests. It's an awesome place to come for dessert after dinner somewhere else. The ambience is funky and cool! The salted caramel brownies are divine.

What I don't like: I find that most of the pastries could use more sugar. They are not as sweet as I like."}
{"text":"The croissant sandwiches are awesome! The chocolate mouse is
outstanding! Wish the seating was more comfortable. They have an odd layout of tables."}
{"text":"Very interesting vibe.  Open 24/7, very chill, and awesome baked goods.  The sandwiches and soups were prepared quickly and were very tasty.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'd kept hearing about how great Amelie's was and finally I had to see what the hype was all about.  So I left work in South Park at 9:30 and drove to Amelie's in NoDA...and now I'm hooked.

This place is extremely eclectic, with furniture from the ReStore in a Warehouse looking strip mall.  Parking is great and there's even a patio for outside seating.  

But you're not going to Amelie's for the parking or the outside seating.  The pasteries are to die for.  I had a cup of coffee, a croissant, and some raspberry tart thing...for dinner.  YUM!

It killed my diet but I didn't care - even returning the next day to try something else.  Now I'm intentionally finding a reason to go to NoDA just to go to Amelie's."}
{"text":"Happy staff and a really good dirty chai! Couldn't remember the fancy French name for it."}
{"text":"Best tarts EVER! We had the pear, apricot mixed fruit and raspberry lemon cream tarts. All extremely delicious."}
{"text":"I came across this place after craving sweets while having drinks earlier in the night. It was open until MIDNIGHT! Very rarely do you find a pastry place open that late. There was a line as we walked in so I knew it was good. Everything looked amazing and tasted just as amazing too. Creme brûlée, macaroons, tarts! All the desserts ranged from $3-$6 in price. They also had a regular food menu with sandwiches and small plates. I ordered a few deserts to share and a coffee. The coffee was a perfect temperature and I didn't have to wait 10 minutes for it to cool down."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the Salted Carmel Brownies! My mom comes to Charlotte to visit me from Ohio and she will go by herself! She loves this place too!!"}
{"text":"The Blue and Yellow tea with half steamed milk is amazing! All of the coffee drinks are delicious. For food, the turkey and bacon and chicken salad (on a croissant) is the best. Love the atmosphere and French decorations. Plenty of seating but only one or two outlets to plug-in upstairs. Free Wi-fi and very nice staff."}
{"text":"The beautiful desserts, handmade breads and soups from scratch are all pretty good. It's a late night destination for many in Charlotte since it's open 24 hours. 

The menu is a bit limited and it's kinda hit or miss. I've had great soup & sandwiches here and other times it's been \"meh\"."}
{"text":"This place is overrated! I would rather do Starbucks! The pastries are too pricey and taste stale. Coffee is disgusting! I have tried almost every kind of coffee here and nothing tastes good. The menu is written in unreadable text and the worker doesn't want to help you choose anything and always refer to the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is cute. There are great pastries here as well as a cute bar where you can get a cup of wine to accompany your pastry.

This is a great place to bring the family as the tables are large and are made for groups of 4/5 people.

The decor is cute, I love French gallery style but I will say the paintings that are hung on the wall are ridiculously crucked and need to be leveled out.

Also the bathrooms definitely need some love as well, they are what you would expect in a dive bar in NYC .

Overall it's a great place and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have a new Amelie's near my home. I have come in a few times to get some homework in during the day. Their pastries are so delicious! but a little pricey.. my favorites are the fruit tarts, napoleons, coconut macaroons and palmiers! I'm especially a fan of the cinnamon sugar covered palmiers. The expresso drinks also come with a free palmier on the side. It's a nice and open location. The tables are not all ideal for getting work done because of the lack of outlets on the floors. Plus some of the tables are too tiny to have a laptop, drink and food on it. However, it's very relaxing (when it's not too busy) and the atmosphere is nice for relaxing and maybe reading a book. I also like that it's open later than most cafes. It also doesn't feel as cramped as the 24/7 location in Noda. I wouldn't recommend coming in with such a large group. I saw that a group of 15-20 had come in and they used up all the larger tables and a few smaller ones. The tables aren't really made to come together like that... just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Yuppies and hipsters abound, NoDa is most likely the coolest place in Charlotte.  Enter Amelie's Bakery.  I will be honest, the food is delicious here.  However, the ambiance is definitely what takes the cake with this bakery. Yes, pun intended.

I indulged in the critically-acclaimed salted caramel brownie, and it was deliciously rich.  The luscious European butter used for their pastries certainly give a certain richness and flavor that normal butter cannot provide.  Also, I had the French Almond and Raspberry macaroons, equally delicious, complimenting my green-white tea perfectly with every respective bite and sip. 

Again, the ambiance.  Two acoustic guitarists, excellent finger-picking, not so excellent voices, jammed in the main seating area. Classics like the Berenstain Bears and French novellas line the shelves, and a fireplace adds to the warmth of the lighting.  All in all, quite a comfortable area, and a great cafe to unwind after a stressful corporate day, one that I know all too well."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!
Great place n atmosphere reasonably priced food, deserts, etc. highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"great coffee shop, good value, plenty of seats, I am vegan, and do not drink soy milk, so knowing that they offer Almond Milk was a big plus."}
{"text":"Stopped in the new location on their opening day and already I love it.  The pastries and sandwiches are just as delicious as the original location in NoDa, but much closer to my house.  It's a huge space when you walk in, with the counter displaying the offerings in the back.  If you've been to the NoDa location, the case and set up of the case looks exactly like the original.  There were some pleasant surprises at this location.  Over to the right of the Pastry counter in the far corner is a wine/coffee bar.  They have beer and wine for sale as well as a variety of coffee drinks.  We bought our pastry and espresso at the counter then went over to the coffee bar and waited for our drinks. We sat down at the bar and ate our pastry and drank our espresso.  It was a wonderfully relaxing time.  We most definitely will be back to sit on the outdoor patio and to get some wine at the wine bar."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!  The pastries here are excellent.  High quality and fresh!  The ambiance is very trendy, with slight French overtones.  My hipster friends would love it.  My boyfriends mother hated it.  I love it.  Yes, the food is pricey but it's authentic and everything is made form scratch, well worth the price in my opinion.  Be prepared for long lines though, especially when college is in session and Friday and Saturday late night.  We waited in an hour ong line on Friday at 11pm.  It was so worth it though.  It's the only place you can satisfy your craving for a excellent pastry at 2:30am.  Can't wait to take my family here when they come to visit."}
{"text":"This place is popular and my wife loves it, but it's not really my thing. Pastries and coffee are good. Staff is friendly but everything always seems to be disorganized and you're expected to know how things operate. It's good for a quick meeting if you're in a pinch. 

The people watching is pretty great."}
{"text":"Nice place for a snack and cold beer.  Pleasant noda IPA and a good jambon et fromage.  The baguette was great.  I will stop back!"}
{"text":"This is delicious little lunch spot. Only it's not little--- it's big with lots of seating and lots of fun and funky decor. Seriously, the decor is out of this world amazing. You could spend hours exploring every corner of this place, finding delight in the details. 

The ordering process was a little confusing, as there are separate lines depending on what you want to order. I waited in line for close to 20 minutes and I wish that there was a better system in place. I got a half of a chicken salad croissant with a cup of asparagus and leek soup. Heavenly, I tell you. My mouth rejoiced. I also sampled some French Macarons and they were as good as good can be."}
{"text":"This is the place I always suggest to visitors! I always want to take them to Amelie's because of the different vibe, unique decor, and delicious food. It just seems to be a Charlotte staple. 

I have tried several of the different pastries and desserts but I always end up landing back on the French Macaroons - my favorite: the pistachio (although I liked it better before they started adding the pistachio pieces on the outside, I think the extra baking of the pistachios changes their flavor). Anyway, I thought this was a great place to come and do homework when I was in graduate school, as it allowed for me to chill with my headphones or have group study sessions. 

The tricky part is timing. I have gone in with no line, and I have gone in other times and the line is wrapped into the other rooms of the building. Seating can also be tricky as well due to popularity."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've ever been to. Everything here is top notch. The turkey bacon sandwich is heavenly. Add a cup of spicy Tai soup, a lavender lemonade and a chocolate mousse cup to have the best meal in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amelie's was decent but not worth the price or wait in line in my opinion. I went with my girlfriend, her mom, and my mom and was able to try a few different pastries. 
The salted caramel brownie was good. I really liked the brownie, and the caramel topping was okay although not really my thing. For $2.50 though, I would expect more than the tiny 1 oz brownie you get.
The eclairs were decent too. I didn't really like the pastry part, but the vanilla and chocolate custards were both pretty tasty. My girlfriend and her mom were both disappointed that it was a custard filling rather than cream but enjoyed them nonetheless. 
I had one bite of a piece of chocolate cake and it was pretty good as well, but not anything worth $5 for a cupcake sized piece.
After waiting in line for 10 minutes (it was Saturday evening, I'll give them that) and seeing the really high prices for the portions, I assumed these desserts must be heaven, but everyone in my group agreed they were just decent and nothing more."}
{"text":"The salted caramel brownie might be the best sweet I've ever had!  Wasn't terribly impressed with their croissants, which is what kept me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"After hearing so many rave reviews about Amelie's I figured it was time to experience the bakery first-hand to see if I would be singing its praises like everyone else.

How do I rate it? Good but way over-hyped.

The building itself, however, is pretty cool. The outside of it is fairly inconspicuous, but as soon as you cross through the threshold, you enter a whole different atmosphere. The inside resembles an old Victorian house with seating throughout. Though I was impressed by its uniqueness, I can't say that I felt relaxed there; I wouldn't spend hours at Amelie's as I would at other coffee shops. 

The food was OK. I kept it fairly simple with an ice tea and a turnover--nothing too crazy or special, for that matter. 

The service is friendly and quick, but to the Amelie's staff, I implore you---please, please, please don't call me ma'am. Especially three times during a 30-second period of taking my order. Maybe it's a Southern thing, but to us Northerners, it makes us feel old!"}
{"text":"I just realized that I have not reviewed Amelie's - one of my favorite-est bakeries around.

Let me just tell you about my love affair with this French bakery. 

1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty/sweet/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it.

2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla! 

3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too.

4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends.

5) Free WiFi! Woot!

6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries.

On a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it. 

Amelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Amelies. It's nice to have a 24 hour spot in CLT. The coffee is fantastic and love getting the French Press. The only item I don't like are there croissants. They don't seem to have the puff pastry layered very well and there is no Almond croissant available. There is a very hard overcooked double-baked croissant with an Almond filling, but won't be ordering that again. 
The macaroons are wonderful, the Ecalir was perfect and of course the famous Salted Caramel brownie is the best."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for gathering with friends at nights... They have some kind of pastry which I like the most and I go there to get that each time! The staff are nice and the atmosphere is enjoyable....

Update: it's been a few months that you have to wait in a long line to get the service. The line sometimes is more than  70 people and they only have one cashier. So you should wait for about an hour just in the line... I am not going there anymore...."}
{"text":"What a cute place. Very artsy decor  order at the counter and get your number and when it's ready it will be brought to you. Authentic French pastry   A casual relaxing place to wait for friends"}
{"text":"Quirky  artsy place  mismatched furniture and proud of it  
You come in and see all the pastries in the glass case. Order as many or few as you like, or order from the board.  Relaxed Bohemian French feel.no feeling of being hurried. We got a variety from the case and coffee. What a wonderful experience 
Will sure go again and try the food items"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. This is the bakery in my dreams. I have always wanted to go on a date with my husband to a place like this and it was absolutely heavenly. Everything looked delicious but we ordered two Creme Brûlées, one vanilla bean and one mixed fruit. We also had one of their famous caramel brownies. The creme brûlées were torched after we ordered them so they were perfect and so creamy. You could see the tiny vanilla bean caviar in the cream! It was soo flavorful. The brownie was like nothing I'd ever had before. It looked overwhelmingly sweet at first sight but when I took that first bite, I immediately went for another. It was crunchy on the bottom, soft in the middle and caramel salty sweet on top. I loved it! It's too bad we don't have a place like this in Tucson, Az! Hint hint!"}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast I have ever had! What I love is that it is a great atmosphere- super French bakery but not stuffy. The food menu is simple but with a great variety. More impressive is the sweets case! Gorgeous and delicious! Chocolate eclairs are to die for and the cappuccino is amazing. Service was super friendly and the guy behind the counter was very helpful in aiding me to make up my mind what to get. Don't miss this dog- friendly spot with wonderful baked goods. Coming back for that bread pudding!!!"}
{"text":"i was very pleased with the decoration it was someones living room. The dessert looked really pretty but,it was not that great at all. The caramel salted brownie was grainy and the caramel was very thick . i did however have a brae and turkey sandwich and that was the best part of my meal it was very plain just how i like it. i could see my self here again mostly because i think this is the only 24 hour place in town."}
{"text":"This place is really good for breakfast food. And they serve beer and wine. A super cool looking place to spend time enjoying a cup of yummy coffee. I only have it 4stars cuz I wish they had.more food options."}
{"text":"Magnifique! Sandwich croissant for breakfast is perfect for sharing and coffee is spot on. A must go if you live here or if you are just visiting beautiful Charlotte Uptown..."}
{"text":"I love the pastries and coffee and the atmosphere but I have to say the SERVICE is TERRIBLE!!!  Cashiers and coffee makers stand there & chat with each other when customers are standing waiting! Or out if 3 cashier counters only 1 is working! They take their sweet time making coffee too! This is NOT a service oriented business. The management needs to do a better job of training their stuff to do their job in Timely and Friendly manner instead of treating customers as if doing them a favor! 

You guys are surrounded by bankers who don't have a lot of time to stand around & waiting till the staff finish their chit chat!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I am just now writing about Amelie's. With hundreds of reviews... what's really left to say? Let's do this the Nikki way.

Morning, afternoon, night, 4AM (Yes, I use to go here at 4AM all the time. Life of a former bartender), this place always has a crowd. People watching in the middle of the night = fantastic. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, sugar craving, coffee run, middle of the night soup... this place does it all.

My personal favs: salted caramel brownies (I dream about them), chocolate croissant, spinach asparagus leek soup (all the soups are fantastic), mushroom tartine, turkey and brie sandwich. You really can't go wrong with anything here. 

Parking alert for Wednesdays: it's NoDa Run Club night so it's pretty insane in this area. I avoid it all costs.

Amelie's is one of the many reasons I miss living in NoDa. However, I think my waistline and wallet are happy I'm no longer just blocks from here."}
{"text":"Salted caramel brownies. I mean, how could you not love Amelie's just simply based on those three words?! 

What sets this location apart from the others? You can watch the bakers in action through the glass. Pretty cool. When it comes to any Amelie's, you really can't go wrong with anything you order. Some of my absolute favorites: pate (I get it without bread), salted caramel brownies, any of the tartines, spinach asparagus leek soup (hell, any of the soups really), macarons. They do a really great job with seasonal menus as well. Unlike the flagship store in NoDa, this one also serves alcoholic bevvies. *pops bottle*

If you work uptown, this is a great place to grab coffee or eats. I like to do meetings here and then stay after for a couple hours to get some work done. If you're not already in the area, be prepared that you will have to pay to park somewhere. The joys of uptown. Note: street parking is free after 6pm."}
{"text":"In three words, Amelie's is: delicious, cool and amazing."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for breakfast. The decorations are awesome there are huge windows we could watch the bakers do in their game in the morning. Will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  first time here was on a first date and it was an excellent choice to end a first date. Loved the pecan tart! Definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"I love Amélie's and I'm happy this location opened up right near my house! My only complaint is that I wish they had a better stock on some of the pastries. Other than that I love this place!"}
{"text":"Amelie's, always delicious! They have a great selection of macaroons and petit fours, and the seasonal coffee specials were quite good."}
{"text":"This used to be a fantastic, unique spot to grab a delicious treat, but in the last couple years this place has lost its appeal. Arrogant service people, groups of people that hang out for hours on end, long lines that can last up to 45 minutes, and lack of parking coupled with the scandal over employee pay have taken the lustre off what was a unique spot in Charlotte. The treats are still amazing, but I hate actually going."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Amelie's. This location is very spacious with plenty of seating. The coffee selection of coffee, teas, desserts, food and wine. The staff with friendly and the service is fast. This is a great place to study, have a meeting, or meeting up with friends.

I had the pecan tart and it was good. My friend had the peach tart, it was okay but it would've been better if it was warmed up.My friend devoured the peach tart lol

The Cafe Marcotter was delicious with the perfect amount of vanilla and caramel. It had a cute little spider web on top of the cup. I will definitely have to get it again."}
{"text":"Everything that we ordered was amazing. We gad chocolate mousse, cream puff and quiche. Delicious! U can also see the making of their desserts. The inside is beautiful and makes u feel like u r in Paris!  Great experience."}
{"text":"love this place,  has a fun relaxed atmosphere and great tasting food!"}
{"text":"What an impressive meal. The baguettes and crossaints are amazing. The pastries are mouth-watering. The ambience made you feel like you were in Paris. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The environment itself was very cozy and relaxing. The art and furniture was very interesting and comfortable. It's a good place to study or grab a few pastries or coffee. I got the chocolate brownie macaron and the salted caramel macaron... so good!!! A little pricey but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"There are many things that I love about this place. It is trendy, quick, and cheap. I love all of the random stuff they have in the bakery because it makes the long line seem quick. The food is wonderful and it is priced well. I gave Amelie's a four out of five stars because I wish it was closer to where I live...But then again if it was any closer I would go all the time because I have a really bad sweet tooth, so really I give this place a four and a half star. I need to make this a once a month visit. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly average cafe overall.  The food offerings are slight and not meal-level, the pastries (that I've had) are unimpressive, the coffee is mediocre, the layout is spastic, the furnishings are uncomfortable, it is not particularly good for pleasant conversation or getting work done.   It is, however, open 24 hours everyday and that makes it a great destination after 11:00pm when all the other cafes in town have closed.  

The service is good and the people working there are very friendly -- just as I would expect for such a friendly city.  It has great potential if they can upscale the tables and chairs to more practical and comfortable pieces, improve the lighting, decrease the background noises, and make the layout more attractive, functional, and cohesive."}
{"text":"I want to love Amelie's. I'm a baker and lover of all things artsy and weird. But to me, that fifth star just isn't there.  Let me explain my conundrum...

The concept of a French bakery in Charlotte makes me swoon. Heck, the concept of any kind of bakery not inside a grocery store is a great. I have a long-standing affair with Parisian pastries and flaky breads. Caramel salted brownies? You guys go ahead...I'm going to hang around.

The atmosphere is kitschy in a way that works. Incredibly odd light fixtures. Doorways in random places, a framed mirror that wraps around the corner, and a menagerie of random chairs and tables, like a home show for the Island of Misfit Toys.

And, open 24 hours. In Charlotte. No further details needed.

But, it is crowded. Very, crowded. With so few other options for the people still awake at 3am, the lines are always long. It's rare to find a table in the cafe-proper (better luck in the atrium common area behind their spot). And, (this is me being picky), there usually seem to be a few too many high schoolers who are just so cool and trendy it hurts (no, it really does hurt...my eyes can't take that much skinny jeans and awful plaid...but I digress). In my opinion, they are a bit pricey, too. Yes, they make great food. But $1.50 or $2 for something that is barely one bite? 

Amelie, I think we will have to continue our love-hate courtship. Let's just not assign a label and see where it goes."}
{"text":"This bakery is probably the best place we ate at while in Charlotte. It's cute, modern, chic and they sell great pastries.

The décor is nice (we ate in some kind of atrium, a covered outdoor area, didn't love it), I'd recommend eating in the actual café, there's plenty to look at it (cool furniture, artwork, etc) and they play cool music.

Service is nice, we got some lunch here, a few tartines (European style open sandwich, just one baguette slice on the bottom), mine (vegetarian) with pesto, mozarella and tomatoes (I got half), my husband got the full tartine - the ham and Gruyere cheese one. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Paris, but they were decent. Nice choice for a snack, they have a great selection of European sodas (San Pellegrino, etc). We got some chocolate croissants for the next morning's breakfast (they were very good) and delicious chocolate éclairs to go (which were the best we had in a long time, the custard was just right). 

Amelie is a cute place to hang out for breakfast, lunch, meet with a friend. If you live in the area or visit Charlotte, give it a try, it won't disappoint. Great selection of pastries, desserts, lunch choices, good prices and free parking."}
{"text":"Amelie's Is a pretty good boulangerie as the French say...pretty decent food selections such as the croque monsieur which is pretty solid, its also a massive place with the French vibe thing going on...service can be better though, its disappointing at times and makes me want to take off another star but the food quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"The food at Amelie's is always amazing. I went here for a small treat-binge for my cheat day, and ended up eating two macarons and a tart with a double shot espresso. The macarons are great, as per usual. The tart left a little to be desired, and felt a bit over-sugared. The espresso, however, was burnt. I will not assume what the issue was, but I was unhappy with it. Owning my own espresso machine, I know the difference between a fresh espresso versus a burnt one. I saw them make it on the spot however, so I believe the problem lies within the beans themselves, not Amelie's. 
Amelie's is almost always packed from front to back, usually with people who may have gotten something but have been there for hours on end. I do like the casual effect, but it does become difficult when you just want to sit and eat for twenty minutes and someone has sprawled all of their bags, book, and laptop across a four top. Definitely think there should be a section designated for more of that nature, so customers that are staying a shorter time can rotate tables out more quickly. 
All in all, will go back from time to time for a little treat, but probably only to-go unless there are already open tables."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Oh Amelie's...it's a good thing I don't live in Charlotte because if I could come here 24/7 (literally), I would be broke and overweight  The orange clove mimosa tastes like fall in a glass, which might be dangerous, so make sure you eat as you drink-- the tomato and pesto savory danish and the root vegetables flat bread are superb and unique! Amelie's is where you want to spend every rainy (and sunny) day (and night)."}
{"text":"Everyone else seems to love this spot.  I was in town for a conference, and found myself here for several meals.  I found it just okay.  If you love French bakeries and coffee, I think you would still want to give this place a try.  Their case of baked desserts was beautiful (I tried both a creme brûlée and a Cream puff, both were good).  The ambiance is lovely.  But expect a line out the door and a sandwich that was just okay, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The salted carmel brownie just didn't taste right and it should be something I'd love given my usual preferences. The sticky buns were tiny and just blah. Not at all good. Gave it away . . . 

The prices are also entirely outrageous."}
{"text":"I judge a French bakery by their palmiers. Theirs are excellent. Everything we got was delicious and fresh and beautiful, and reasonably priced. My only complaint is that you can't check out the pastry case while you're standing in line, which slows things down."}
{"text":"Great desserts! The Lemon Raspberry Tart and Apple Turnovers are both must haves! The environment is nice and comfy with plenty of seating. Staff was really kind!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Size is deceiving. Looks cozy and cramped at first, but wait! There more. It wraps all the way around with different rooms!  It is a French bakery and good for coffee, but they also have soups and sandwiches. I tried the mini chocolate truffles- tasty!"}
{"text":"I arrived around 6:30 pm, ordered a salad and a cup of soup which were delicious, by the way. The problem was that my food finally arrived at 7:05 pm. I asked about it around 6:50. The person told me they were swamped,  and I reminded him that I arrived at 6:30 pm. He brushed me off. So, I had my first disappointment at Carmel Commons Amelie's tonight. Before I left, I ordered a little dessert. The person who helped me listened to my earlier concern, and without even telling me ahead of time, she gave me 10% off. It was an earnest gesture."}
{"text":"Our family friend introduced us to Amelie's a few years ago when she came by with a box of delectable desserts to cheer my family up while my mom was undergoing chemo for breast cancer.  That was the first time I had the salted caramel brownie.  It was perfection, not only for the taste and texture, but for the uplifting power it had during a difficult time in my life.

Since then, every subsequent trip to Charlotte involves the obligatory stop here.  It's nice to eat there and take-in the French bistro vibe, when a table is available, but we usually grab and go enjoy in the comfort of my mom's house.  There's always a line, but it's good because that gives me time to oogle the display window and decide what else to try along with the salted caramel brownie.  The macarons are HUGE - more to love and savor.  I've also bought some mini tarts to give to friends that I visit in NC or to take back with me to Chi.

The only snafu I've experienced here is being accidentally overcharged for a large order of salted caramel brownies.  The cashier misunderstood and charged me for an extra 4 brownies (he also didn't open the box to count himself).  It was partially my fault for not double checking the bill and correcting it right after.  However, that hasn't stopped me for coming back for more.  I also love the name, which is the same name as my all-time favorite movie!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place definitely leaves an impression. When you walk in here, you will notice all the unique furnishing they have around the cafe (from umbrella lights, upside down tree lights, mona lisa with glasses painting, fake fireplaces, etc.). 

You go up to the counter to order. They have a line for pastry but you can also come to this line if you're ordering something other than pastry. I was here two days in a roll because I was at a conference nearby. The first time I tried their bourbon peach and honey macarons (2 for about $5) for desserts. The honey macaron was definitely very delicious! The bourbon peach one was good too, but I liked the creamy filling in the honey macaron better compared to the jelly like filling in the bourbon peach macaron. 

I was here again for lunch and tried the croque monsieur, lemon and raspberry mini tart, and coconut ginger cream chai. The croissant of the sandwich was great, very buttery and flaky, but the sandwich was on the salty side. I would recommend getting something else if you're ordering a sandwich. The mini tart is a great size if you don't want to ingest too many calories. I liked the tartness of the lemon filling and the crunchy tart shell. Lastly, the coconut ginger cream chai was a refreshing delicious drink. It sounds a bit weird, but you really don't taste too much of ginger, there is coconut flakes in the drink, and the spices in the chai aren't too overwhelming. 

The only downside of this place is that it can be chaotic when they get busy. We waited probably 10 minutes at our table when a waitress came by to tell us they ran out of quiche (hmm, the cashiers at the ordering counter didn't know this?). They're suppose to have these cool table trackers, but this system doesn't seem to be working out too well for them. A lot of the waitresses were walking around yelling out numbers because they couldn't find the table with the order. 

Chaos aside, I love the decorations in this place and the desserts are yummy!"}
{"text":"Probably the best bakery in Charlotte, behind polka-dot cupcakes, and open 24 hours!  Lots of variety and excellent dark chocolate deserts in bite-sized portions.  Great people watching late-night on weekends as people stop by for a chocolate nightcap."}
{"text":"So, I'm sitting here like usual at Amelie's waiting forever on a sandwich that I ordered 15+min ago and there was no line (ironically) when I got here. Anything I've ever gotten here is golden! Pastries, sandwiches, soups, coffees whatever...it's all been delicious!  But, I just can't bring myself to give more than three stars because I have to believe that their process for preparing food orders is just too inefficient and can be faster than it is.  The phrase good things come to those who wait is an understatement. If your in a rush or really hungry, bring a book or friends or consider somewhere else. If you have the time, get prepared for good food and pastries."}
{"text":"I know there has been a lot of a controversy lately over Amelie's, let them sort it out internally. They have a fantastic location in Rock Hill, SC, in a renovated bank building. On one of the corners in Old Town, it fits right in with the Old Town feel. 

We've been there a couple of times recently for take home, have had their Lemon & Raspberry Tarts, the Chocolate Mousse cup with a chocolate-dipped strawberry on top, and the Pate sandwich. Everything has been excellent. The Pate sandwich, a simple treat of pate and cornichons on a buttered baguette was perfect. Very light and the baguette was delicious. The desserts, as you would expect from a proficient French bakery, were decadent and amazing.

Their service is great - everyone is very friendly and ready to help as soon as you walk in the door. Their attitude shows that they care about their customers, and that is a great thing to see.

Rock Hill location is highly recommended (I haven't been too the other two locations). :)"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I lived in Charlotte and I still make it a point to stop by every time I am back in town. First off I love the decor. It feels like you are actually in a cafe in France, plus it it very cozy. The pastries are amazing! My favorites are the salted caramel brownies and any of the maroons!  I also really enjoy their coffee and usually get it when I am there. This cafe also does orders so if you are having a party or a birthday you can call and have it ready for pick up."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit. We don't live in the area but when we are in town we like to visit. Good selection of coffees, pastries and deserts. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, I am sad I didn't find Amelie's sooner. After a long day in Charlotte I was looking for a place to grab some coffee and a dessert and there was Amelie's. As soon as we stepped inside the smell of fresh baked pastry welcomed us. Once I saw the fruit tart I knew what I was going to order. My husband choose the chocolate croissant. I was pleasantly surprised when they informed us that they serve french press coffee. The interior is decorated in a funky and eclectic style which is n stark contrast to the refined pastry they serve. 

The crust on the tart was delicate and buttery topped with sweetened cream and sliced fresh ripe fruit. There was a sweet sticky glaze over the top. YUM! The chocolate croissant was flaky and buttery with just enough chocolate in every bite. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"When we drove into the city, we didn't expect any place to be open for dinner after 9 pm, but somehow we stumbled upon this bakery. The interior is so cute and very spacious. This bakery is open very late which is super convenient. 

We ordered the turkey and brie sandwich and the pate sandwich. I HIGHLY recommend the pate sandwich. For dessert, the pistachio cranberry petit gateau and the creme brûlée are very tasty on its own or paired with red wine. 

Must try if you're in the mood for sweets or a quick eat in the city!"}
{"text":"Found out about this spot while standing in line at Heroes Con. The place did not disappoint. Food, beverages and desserts are superb!!! If you're ever in uptown North Charlotte area, you really need to stop by!!"}
{"text":"Great place! I Love everything especially the orange macaroons! It can get pretty expensive (college student budget) but everything else makes up for it! This place helps me with my all nighters before exams. AND I love that they have security there it makes me feel safe enough to be there into the wee morning."}
{"text":"I went to Amelie's twice and really enjoyed the food. Friendly employees and the apricot tarts were delicious. I had the turkey and Brie sandwich which was delicious. Coffee is superb. Crowded on a Sunday with a long line means that people like the food and it's fresh. Shabby Chic decor that I loved. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Really great pastries in charlotte! I had a chocolate croissant and some other treats that I can't remember the name of. My sister had the bread pudding which was filled with coconut, raisins, and pecans. That was to die for, they serve it warm which it takes a minute to heat up, but still worth  the wait!  Their prices on pastries weren't bad the highest priced items were their bigger items like the muffins for around/close to $5. The decor in the shop was very unique, there wasn't one thing the same.  The shops tables and chairs are vintage and so are the decorations. Overall it's a great place to go to study or have desert.  Plus they are open 24/hrs! Would defiantly go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"This bakery is 24 hours, and that is deserving of major brownie points. I think they also bake brownies. The breakfast offerings go beyond your standard muffin and croissants, and they have a very eclectic menu. I must say that I cannot imagine who would be willing to drive to this possible late-night eatery. There are bars about a mile down the road, but to drive here to have a drunken meal of muffins and bread is beyond me!

I went with the mushroom duxelle tartine. I have not had too much MD in my day, so it was nice having something different than your standard biscuits and gravy in the South, though I assure you Amelie's could whip up a mean B&G.

The open-faced fungus sandwich was awesome. The spread was rich and buttery and tasted exactly how roasted mushrooms should taste. The crusty warm bread on the bottom was the perfect canvas. Not much else can be said besides that the $4 tag is a great price to pay.

Amelie's provides you with a wide selection of baked and cooked goods, so I recommend you go when in Charlotte looking for something unique and convenient."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I do dig this gem of a cafe in NoDa, but more for the atmosphere than the baked goods (which I think could use some more oomph). I love the quaint decor, the antique mismatched chairs and spread out feel and the art on the wall. Students studying, a couple playing boardgames, friends catching up - Good vibe. 

Coffee was good, thank goodness, I was dying for java. We sat outside in the atrium, sort of odd that they expand out because it doesn't seem a part of the cafe, but it's so quiet and open, I quite like that they have the space. We had a late lunch and ordered the ham and gruyere tartines. They were tasty, but too small!

Anyway, the main reason I went there was to check out the pastries since I needed dessert for a big family event that's coming up and had read so many rave reviews. The guy at the counter couldn't offer up any free samples (or a smile) but he did walk me through their wonderful looking array of baked goods to tell me what they had which was helpful. I was excited for the tasting and a bit sad that it didn't blow my mind.
I sampled:
Coconut macaroon - meh, a miss for me, I did not dig the sweetener/sugar that they used, I thought they were overpriced, and they were not at all reminiscent of the best macaroons I have ever had, in France. 
Mini berry tart - I wanted to love it, it looked so cute, and it wasn't even too sweet, but it wasn't memorable either.
Chocolate hazelnut tart - recommended by the guy at the counter, I had high hopes for this one, and the chocolate filling, although not really hazelnut-y was decent, but the crust was dry and hard and not ok.
Mini fruit tart - this was the best of the lot, the crust was decent, the custard added moistness. But it didn't make me ooh or ahh either. 

I am disappointed I can't use their baked goods for our event, but they just didn't wow me.

So to sum it up, It's a little out of the way for me, but if I lived closer I would definitely go there often. I was eyeing the chocolate croissant, one of my favorite all time pastries, and I will go for a larger sandwich next time, and maybe sample this salted caramel brownie that is so popular. 

Charlotte needs more non cookie-cutter cafes like this."}
{"text":"Recently had a sweet Sunday lunch at Amelie's bakery. The food was very good and fairly authentic. And the coffee was pretty good for drip. They need about 2 dozen more chairs, as there were plenty of tables even out in the atrium, but not nearly enough chairs, which is just bad form. Two things which would put the place over the top? Small salads such as fruit, goat cheese and pinenuts, and cranberry walnut, as sometimes you just need something green to balance out all the rich foods. The other?  Croissants made in-house.  Yep, they don't make them there, and it's a French Bakery!"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of this cute little cafe-esque place. Great place to study (in the back away from the long a** line for desserts), and delicious tarts! The decor in the bakery reminds me of a french cafe, but surrounded with random artifacts and pieces of history, like Cracker Barrel does with their franchise. 

I HIGHLY recommend the fruit tarts (strawberry, blackberry, or both!) and the lemon and strawberry shortcake marcarons! They make them perfectly every single time, and always have different flavors to choose from. Next time though, as a coffee addict, I will definitely try their lattes! Hopefully I can update on that later this year ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Charlotte!  Been going since college...that's 10 years now!"}
{"text":"Best French pastries in Charlotte! Eclectic decor, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went around 10:30 on a Saturday night.  It wasn't much desserts left due to the fact it closes at midnight. I ordered a macaroon which was good. But the Brown Sugar Butter Pecan was the best coffee drink ever. It was $4 and worth every penny. I would go back just for that. It is seasonal so get it while you can."}
{"text":"I ordered the cranberry orange bread pudding it was pretty good. The staff was friendly I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and a well crafted dessert. Chill environment when not too busy. Coffee is also good."}
{"text":"The pros are that they have made an uptown space unique and comfortable.  But the service was so poor, my husband and I were laughing out loud at how unhelpful the employees were.

Multiple lines for ordering and paying were confusing and resulted in me having to get back in line when our muffin wasn't brought to the table with the rest of our food.  My egg sandwich and coffee got cold at my table while I waited in line watching the painfully slow bakery counter clerk fumble expensive pastries into boxes.   Three cashiers with no one in their line stood around watching the bakery line grow.  Finally a cashier gave in and put on some gloves to help out.

The batter in the muffin that caused the confusion had pockets of unmixed ingredients.

The good news is, good management could improve things, but the employees need to step it up, realizing that they are there to help unfamiliar guests."}
{"text":"Doesn't compare to any patisserie in France but it'll do for Charlotte. Funky and cute interior, great for meetups, casual hangouts, and maybe after dinner dessert. I tried one of the smallish chocolate cakes on my bday, and it was very rich. The ganache on top was especially dense. The cake part was a little dry, but the mousse was light and fluffy. I tried the salted caramel brownie as well, which was delicious, but very sweet. The chocolate croissant looked good on the outside but was sadly barely filled with chocolate on the inside. Tragic."}
{"text":"The interior is not as large as the other locations, but the overall vibe is similar. However, I tried the food and coffee, and for the price, I'm not sure it's quite worth it. I ordered the cappuccino and there was a pitiful amount of foam. It also tasted almost sour. The macarons were beautiful and delicious though, and you can never go wrong with the eclairs either. The tuna salad sandwich was disappointing though. My friend ordered the salad with goat cheese, chicken, and strawberries, which looked really fresh and there was a large portion of it, so perhaps I'll try the salad next time. 
The tables needed to be cleaned - there were empty dishes and mugs on a few of them too.
The workers are friendly, and patiently explained the flavors and such for the pastries."}
{"text":"Favorite Amelie's in Charlotte! The area is huge and the decor is perfect. Lots of seating and comfy sofas to choose from. There's a little area to buy small gifts too like cute mugs and shirts. The workers were super nice and helpful when I was choosing which flavors of macaroon to get. Definitely recommend the chocolate/ginger and the honey."}
{"text":"What a yummy treat - I came here this past weekend for a breakfast.  The aura is great! So many different places to sit and things to look at! They offer a variety of breakfast options from sandwich's to baked goods, they have a few water stations throughout the restaurant to get water from if you don't want to drink one of there freshly brewed coffees/teas."}
{"text":"This place is great, almost similar to the other location.  I love that it is now in Uptown.  They are always busy so you have to stay on your toes and know exactly what you want to order because they are a little impatient when you ponder over an order.  The coffee, tea and pastries are all to die for.  Very big inside and have outside seating as well."}
{"text":"Went after a Panthers game, great that they're open 24/7. Loooong line and I was excited. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. I ordered a plain croissant, a mini fruit tart, a mini chocolate mousse, and a cafe capuchon (European cappuccino). 

Café: 4 stars
Chocolate mousse: 4.5 stars
Fruit tart: 3 stars
Croissant: 1.5 stars

I consider a plain croissant to be the litmus test of a French bakery. As such, Amelie comes up short. The croissant was bread-y and limp, exactly like my local grocery store, not flaky and fall apart when you bite into it true French style. 

Service at the pastry counter was great. The male barista was curt. 

I'd say I won't return but being it's the only place open at 12:30am I might go for coffee and mousse."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place that could be great with a few tweaks to the operation.
There is always a line. And you cannot see the menu until you are at the head of the line. Unless you squeeze into the people at the head of the line to read the menu before you get in the line. Then part of the menu is on a chalkboard behind the other chalkboard menu so you really have to literally squeeze in with the people in line to read the menu. 
UNLESS- you wait to read the menu when it's your turn at the front of the line. Which may be why the lone moves SO slowly. You can stand in line for literally 30 minutes just to place your order, so if you're having a meal might as well plan on spending a while there. 
Seems like a separate line just for take-out bakery items might help things too. 
Just sayin'.
However, every single thing I have eaten and had to drink here is out-freaking-standing. Too bad sometimes I'm just not up to the hassle of going"}
{"text":"Always good food and selection of different items. Super well known for pastries and such but also God place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I am always happy with my choices and I like that they change it up often enough for those selections. Just go check it out."}
{"text":"My BIL suggested Amelie for dessert after a lovely dinner at Cajun Queen. It's a lively, eclectic space with more seating than it might first appear. That's a good thing, as it seems they're always crowded. 

Overall, there were things I loved about Amelie but some significant shortfalls too.

Menu: A French-inspired listing of sandwiches, salads and soups. There's a daily quiche too and really creative drinks like lavender honey soda. Five stars here.

Service: Though its crowded, the line moves fast and the staff is nice. Five stars.

Presentation: Just TRY and walk past that pasty case and not order a thing. It's not happening, friends. The devil's winning this round because the offerings are are beautiful. Four stars.

Actual taste: Sad trombone noise. For all that the space is cool and the product is beautiful, if it doesn't taste great, well - we have an issue. Sadly, my raspberry rose eclair was the size of a long John and frankly, was overbaked and tasted of neither rose nor raspberry - just sugary sweet donut icing. Sad face. The dessert stuff is all about twice as big as it should be but half as tasty. One and a half stars.

I like the 24/7 hours, the space, and the concept. I'll be back to try actual food since it sounded great but I'm a hard pass on the sweets for now."}
{"text":"they got 3 stars for being open 24 hrs and dealing with the bar crowd. Many of the pastires are great some not so much. I've been there 4 times"}
{"text":"Wonderful pastries, so sweet and awesome!  odd dining arrangement, but great deserts, be ready to wait when you go late, late and later!!"}
{"text":"This place is def. a must among Charlotteans. It is cute and has great food and baked goods and of course coffee! This location serves also wine and beer at their chic bar. It is always busy and I am not surprised by that. The location is large and has ample seating spaces, including outside. It has a comfortable fireplace area downstairs. 
Parking is an issue as it is only on-street parking, but totally worth it.
The bathrooms are clean, the staff is friendly (despite being super busy) and the decor mind-blowing. 

I love how the cooks are working behind the large glass walls, in their chef gear. It gives it a very professional feel. The reason I am not giving it five stars is the overpriced coffee and the lack of parking. But truly both things are not something that should discourage one to go.
I just do not like cruising too long to get a spot if I want to get coffee nor do I want to spend more than three dollars on a simple drink. But if you do not mind, the regular coffee is well priced, so this is a good way to avoid paying the \"hipster\" price."}
{"text":"Amelie's is great spot to have your morning coffee and pastry. The decorations really provide the unique ambiance they you can get no where else. It seems to have a big Tim Burton/Alice in wonderland/Mad hatter feel to the place. You'll see Eclectic artworks, upside down tables and chairs and out of place chandeliers that seem to work well together. 

The pastries itself offer a huge selection of options, ranging from cakes, cookies and french style tarts. Coffee is also extremely delicious here.

There are plenty of seating around and its mostly a self serve place. When I went, there seemed to not be enough seating on a Friday morning. Either way I am a huge fan of this place. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Everything at this Amelie's is wonderful all the pastries the coffee the ambiance this particular location you have to use the parking garage that's crowded and it's very limited parking you must go on many many levels to find a spot AND we had to pay six dollars for a 20 minute visit"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of fancy French pastries. They look pretty but they don't taste all that great. Luckily Amelie's has other offerings that keep me interested and coming back for more! 

One favorite is the breakfast sandwich. I order mine with spinach, egg whites, and mozzarella on a baguette. It is lightly toasted and the cheese is melted perfectly. It is $4.89 and 75 cents extra to sub egg whites for the whole egg. It's so good I don't care and sometimes I am guilty of ordering two!

After I'm done eating probably a day's worth of calories on 2 breakfast sandwiches, sometimes I feel like eating something \"healthy.\" Lynn's salad is tiny and pricey but it's amazing! It's made up of mixed greens, mandarin oranges, strawberries, feta, and candied almonds but the thick, gooey, brown crap that it comes with makes it crave-worthy! It is called celery seed vinaigrette but it doesn't look much like a vinaigrette. It's sweet and tangy and I always have to get extra because one little cup just isn't enough! If I happen to have any leftover then I just eat the rest of it by the spoonful and if it wasn't looked down on then I would just lick that cup clean.. Ah who am I kidding I've already done that!

Listen to the majority and get the salted caramel brownie! Dense, rich brownie on the bottom and a layer of toffee flavored caramel on top.. Mmmm. Also the lemon raspberry tart is delish!

Minus one star because it's expensive for the tiny portions but the flavors are on point!"}
{"text":"I popped in with my parents for a sweet treat.  It's nestled behind Park Road shopping center.  I'm excited to report that there's an alternate entrance with a ramp if the steps at the main entrance are an issue (just follow the sign).

Great location, friendly staff and lots of great choices!  Plenty of parking. Eclectic but tastefully decorated.  We visited on Friday mid-afternoon.  They were busy but seating was not an issue.  Customers of all ages were there.  Some catching up with old friends, others working on their computers. 

We were promptly assisted at the counter by the kind young lady.  She answered our questions on the pastry options and flavors.  Plenty of staff on duty to ensure a speedy checkout.  Everyone in our group was super satisfied with our selections.  We had the chocolate eclair, a cupcake, fruit danish (fresh strawberry and kiwi).  Very good and delicate pastries.  Happy to report that they were not overly sweet.  

We'll definitely be back soon to try more pastry options."}
{"text":"Stopped by the new uptown location- delish as always!  I managed to time it just right to be there as everyone was leaving the Panthers Pep Rally, which was note ideal, but the line moved pretty quickly and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on the Tour de Food while in Charlotte for the weekend. We enjoyed it so much we came back the rest of the days we were in town!!! The decor and overall ambiance of Amélie's is fun and chic! I just couldn't stop looking around at all of the incredible chandeliers and knick knacks. We tried the salted caramel brownies first. Heaven. That's the only way to describe it!!! The caramel is homemade and should be on every single pasty or dessert. I need more of it in my life. We also had a sample of the artichoke leek soup, which was savory and delightful. I tried the giant Napolean pastry, and needed to take half home. The cream was fluffy and lite, with the bits of chocolate and vanilla snuck in there for extra deliciousness. My husband had a breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg, monchego, and Asiago on a croissant. He quickly and happily devoured it! I'm so glad that we found this place and we will definitely be bringing our families and friends here to visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great selection of pastries to choose from. Tea and coffee are great as well. Plenty of eclectic seating to choose from which definitely makes this place unique."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place for a bit now but didn't write a review because...well...everyone already knows it's amazing. 

BUT. Today I ordered a chai tea latte for the first time. And it's got to be one of the best I've ever had. 

I'm always searching for good chai tea lattes, because a lot of places just don't know how to make them. But this! I'm in love. 

Bravo, Amelie's! You never cease to impress me."}
{"text":"I have visited both the Uptown location and Rock Hill location. This is such a cute and eclectic bakery and restaurant. It is fun to meet friends for coffee or have a romantic snack with a significant other. The bakery offers a beautiful array of pastries. Anything I have had or my friends and husband have always been tasty and fresh. The coffee is great as well. I have had the iced coffee and cafe au lait, and both I would order again. The atmosphere is what probably makes this such a lovely place to visit. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because they don't seem to have a good system for calling out orders. The Uptown location is noisy and hard to hear. The Rock Hill location they kind of just put the order on the counter and you have to guess if is is your drink. Other than that, it is just a great place!"}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and desserts but not so great customer service. It was our first time here and the cashier was rude rather than helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed that they do not carry there full menu into the night... by night I mean 8:45 pm. Will not come back."}
{"text":"It's taken forever to write a review for this place.  It's a well-known French bakery in Charlotte and gets raves reviews, but not quite sure why.  I mean, they got some solid macaroons, eclairs, and lattes and stuff but nothing that really makes crave Amelie's.  It's probably because it's one of the few places that are open at all hours, making it a solid hang-out to grab a coffee and treat at anytime.

The last time I was here was after catching a movie with some broad.  It was a random Wednesday night and the place was bumping.  When I first walked in, you can smell all the goodness and the air and baked goods displayed behind the case... and then you walk across the Sahara Desert to stand in line.  The line wrapped around to the other room... I'm decent at small-talk and killing time, but hate waiting in lines, especially with some broad on a first date!  It's the wait-in-line-for-20-minutes test - If you can't carry or want to engage in a conversation with your date, you should peace out!  (Not a real test, but I should've known...)

If you're looking for a place to hang out late at night fueled by coffee and French bakery, this place is probably for you.  But keep in mind, the lines are long (both times I went), so if you show up with a date, make sure they're interesting! #potcallingkettleblack

dmo out."}
{"text":"I spent countless all nighters here studying and writing papers. Open 24 hours and they have free wifi - which can be a little slow and hard to connect to at times.

They have a good selection of delicious pastries and desserts - I recommend the salted caramel brownie. The coffees are decent here, too. Never tried the actual food as I always choose the pastries over them.

There's usually always a line, but it will move pretty fast most nights. The place is usually packed and can be hard to find seating if you're going with a large group, but if it's just a few of you there's usually something outside or inside one of the many rooms.

The decor makes sure there's always something interesting to look at"}
{"text":"Be mindful of when you go, the line can be pretty lengthy at times but it's so worth it! And it's open 24 hours so definitely a plus! So many deserts to choose from, it's so overwhelming. The decor makes you think that you are actually in a little French town, so cute. Awesome for an after movie date night! The Napoleon will change your entire life & the roast beef & manchega sandwich is delicious.  MUST try if you're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"What can I say macaroons eclairs croissants and you have to have the chicken salad. Plus they are open 24hours love stopping here when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Salted caramel brownies - the way to anyone's good graces!  This 24 hour bakery has savory and sweet French baked goods and you can't go wrong no matter what you order.  Lattes even come with a fancy design.  Quirky Parisian style - including a locks of love fence add to the fun here."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast sandwich with egg, spinach, mushrooms, and cheese!  Of course you can't go wrong with any of the pastries, I personally love the fruit tarts.  In the summer, the passion fruit lemonade is amazing!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is that its OK..there didn't seem to be anything about this place to make me want to come back. The food was alright but not big enough..pretty much the only thing I like about it is that its open 24/7"}
{"text":"I sincerely hope it was because they're working out the kinks, but our visit last weekend was a big disappointment. We love the pistachio macarons and we seemed to have gotten an old batch (maybe it was overcooked? The normal crunchy/chewy delight was replaced by a solid, crumbly bite) for more than $2 a cookie, it HAS to be right!  - The ladies who waited on us seemed like we were a bit of a bother and they were NOT busy - the seating isn't as cozy as the Noda or Fort Mill locations, but it's a bigger space - so I can appreciate they're fine tuning. The overwhelming smell of floor varnish was a little disruptive too -but I trust this will pass as time goes on. The water station/trash can debacle mentioned by others is accurate (even on a Sunday evening when it's not jam packed)."}
{"text":"Amelie's is so an eccentric atmosphere with impeccable savory sweet (Macaroons are my fave, but your honestly can't go wrong). It's opened 24/7 so if you need table to work from 2-4:30 pm and again after like 9 pm (except on weekends (that party and pastry line doesn't die down until like 2 am, but it' a great place to put all All-Nighter, I know that was my go-to spot until I graduate nursing school.

Cool ambiance - check.
Tasty treats - check.
Great lattes and coffee - check,
And if you got really hungry, their sandwiches are a big fat - check."}
{"text":"Best salted caramel brownie ever."}
{"text":"If you know me, then you know dessert is my favorite part of any meal. Last night my sweet tooth kicked in and my friend brought me to Amelie's. I had ate the almond tea cake last night and it was perfect. It was crispy around the edge, soft in the center and buttery. I saved the key lime tart for today and it was divine. My friend was pleased with the  gluten free salted caramel brownie and a dark chocolate raspberry petit-four. I can't wait to go back so I can try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"First, the food here is amazing. There's a huge selection of french pastries in a display case, and I always pick out whatever looks good when I go. It's easy to spend a lot of money when you want a variety, but each item is very affordable. I've never been disappointed in their desserts, especially the salted caramel brownie Yummmm!! The lavender lemonade is also amazing, I thought lavender would be gross in a drink but it tastes as wonderful as it smells. The sandwiches are so-so, but I usually go with the intent of having dessert and dessert only.

Second, the ambiance is fantastic. I love the French/shabby chic motif they have going on over there, and marvel at it every time I visit. I always notice something different and wish my apartment was as adorable as this bakery.

Third, the service is just as great as the food and ambiance. I hosted my graduation party here last year, and the staff (especially Stephanie) took just great care of me! The cost is fairly reasonable, and I was able to bring in my own food/wine which was a huge plus. Even when dropping by for a quick visit, the staff is always friendly and eager to answer any questions you have about the items they have. 

If you go after a big event in town or late at night, expect the line to be very long. It can seem daunting, but it usually moves pretty fast. Even if it moved slower than molasses, the food is SO worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVE this place...so much so, that even though we eloped to Asheville, we had them make us a small wedding cake to travel with. I treat myself to something savory and something sweet every time I visit Amelie's. And I usually include a lavender lemonade or a French soda. 

My absolute favorite item...and I'm telling you...is practically an oral orgasm...is the strawberry pistachio twice baked croissant. I've never enjoyed a pastry like that one. You can't leave without a salted caramel brownie...and although they appear small, they pack HUGE flavor. 

If you're not so much of a sweet eater, grab a roast beef sandwich. Delish. Or spend like $3 and get a baguette with a dip of choice. 

The line will freak you out...but it moves quick and the service is always friendly. But...be prepared to spend more than you thought you would...and make sure to take something home for later!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a great place to go, whether it's just to hangout, hit the books hard to study, catch a meal with someone, or get some coffee. Located in the middle of downtown Charlotte, my friends and I visited this place prior to a Hornets game in order to kill some time and satisfy our sweet tooth. Amelie's did its best job to make the venue a modern, upbeat, French cafe. The walls are littered with surrealistic paintings, fancy clocks, and bookshelves. The store itself is three stories high, so you won't have a hard time finding a place to sit. I got the macarons and these were either a hit or miss. A couple of my macarons were very hard to chew, while others were fine. The macarons were also a little too sweet to my liking, but may attract those who enjoy sweeter taste. I also was able to try to creme brulee there, which came out a little too burnt on the top (the burnt taste was overwhelming). Also, the strawberry pie/tart that one of my friends got wasn't all too great so I don't recommend that. The only reason why I didn't give Amelie's a five star is because the food and pastries that I tried were somewhat subpar to my expectations. However, I will most definitely visit again and give their other stuff a try!"}
{"text":"Went here while I was visiting Charlotte because it had good reviews and was close by to the church that I went to for Sunday Mass. After the Mass ended, it was around 12:30 and Amelie's seemed like the perfect place to grab lunch. 

I walked in and have to say it was somewhat confusing. There's a really big open area when you walk in and my eyes instantly went to a sign that says \"LINE STARTS HERE\" indicating a hard right upon entering the door. Well I took a hard right and the only thing there was seating and eventually the restrooms followed by an exit. Oooookay. So I walked back up to the front and saw other people ordering by the counters straight ahead from the entrance. So I went there to put my order in and it worked out. But seriously why in the world is that arrow telling you to take an immediate right to get in line when the line starts literally right ahead of you?! 

Anyways I got in line which was also weird because some people were ordering from the pastry case and others were in line to order actual food (but it was all one line going to two separate things. Just weird.) I knew I wanted a pastry but since I also wanted food I just figured I'd get to the main register and order it all at once. When I got to the register to put my order in, the woman told me that pastries had to be ordered \"over there\" (same line I just waited in to get to her....). I asked if I could just pay for the pastry and show my receipt to the other associate and she said it was fine. She was definitely unapologetic. So I put my order in and she handed me a buzzer, which I figured would go off in 5-10 mins. But as I'm standing there waiting to get my pastry, it starts going off! What do I do?! Get out of the pastry line to grab my food? Wait for my pastry and then find an associate to tell them I missed catching my food when it came out?! Ugh WHAT A MESS! Anyways I got the damn pastry and then heard someone yelling my name and sure enough it was a woman with my sandwich. 

So about the actual food. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, a hot chocolate and a salted caramel brownie. I took a seat at the bar once I had all my items. That's a good place to sit if you're solo obviously. 

The chicken salad sandwich was good. The best part was the croissant. Very light and flaky. I normally eat chicken salad on regular bread but I really enjoyed having it on a pastry type bread like that. Might have to make that my new thing. The chicken salad had good flavor but was too chunky in my opinion. I would have liked to see the chicken cut up a bit more. 

As for the hot chocolate, I should mention that I was standing right there as she made it and I watched her take a ceramic mug and fill it up HALFWAY with hot chocolate and then put whipped cream to fill up the rest of the cup. So you are definitely not getting your money's worth. I'd say I probably got about ten gulps total out if it. Which was kind of okay since it was way too chocolatey (and I LOVE sweet stuff). What I didn't like was that I could tell they used dark chocolate and not milk chocolate which I prefer. It did taste like expensive dark chocolate though, so at least I felt fancy I guess. 

As for the salted caramel brownie, that was the star of the show! Not your typical brownie. Much more thin, but great flavor and perfect amount of sweetness. The caramel blanketing the top had the perfect amount of coverage, great caramel consistency with just a hint of salt. It was delicious! I wish I would have gotten a few more to go! 

All in all, it's a place to try at least once. But the confusing setup and ordering process with an average sandwich and \"meeeh\" hot chocolate gives it a 3 from me."}
{"text":"Cant say enough about the salted caramel brownies.  Would like one now :-)"}
{"text":"Get your fat on at Amelie's 24/7. I went back and forth to the pastry case so many times someone (an employee) had to help me out to my car. I was ashamed at my indulgences, but could not stop myself. The place rocks. Need better coffee, but otherwise its one of the better spots in the city. My advice, throw a furniture dolly in the trunk. You'll need it to wheel your bloated carcass out the front door. In fact, consider having Two Men and a Truck meet you there."}
{"text":"The pastries were so yummy and the staff was very pleasant. I truly enjoyed the atmosphere, as well. The only downfall to this place is the parking. The parking is terrible, especially when you come after work or during the weekend."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to meet friends or have a study group. However, I do not see the big deal in their pastries. If you go on a weekend, the lines are out the door. The great thing that I loved is their hours. Its nice to find a place that is open 24 hours for those times you want a pastry at 4 am."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! I always come for a dessert date with my friend and we're never disappointed!! I love the pecan pie tart and ALL of the macaroons! The key lime pie is also a favorite of mine! The line is often long but moves fast so don't be discouraged by that. The staff is patient, friendly, and professional! The prices are a little high but the quality of the food is worth it! I would definitely recommend this 24hr bakery to anyone! A fun and inviting atmosphere also draws a crowd that likes to sit and chat with friends!"}
{"text":"Very savory pastries and desserts! The Honey Macaroons and incredible. The key lime tart is also pretty good.  They have an array of sweet and savory deserts as well as tartine's and salads, etc. 
I will be back soon."}
{"text":"My official favorite coffee shop in Charlotte! The food is amazing! And the coffee is divine."}
{"text":"Overpriced on a lot of things, but open late and the salted caramel brownies are delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good sweets and treat. Very laid back place"}
{"text":"I've been to Amelie's countless times yet I've never written a review. Must be because I was too busy stuffing my face with French delicacies. 

This next statement is no exaggeration...EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD. You can't go wrong when the food is as fresh as it is here. All of the pastries and breads are made in house. For everything that they can't make in house they use only the freshest ingredients!   

One of my favorite things...IT'S ALWAYS OPEN...no literally, they never close so you can wake up in the middle of the night and get a pastry or pull an all nighter studying inside or stumble in for some fancy hangover food. Whatever you want!! 

My personal faves:
Sandwiches: turkey and brie (wiring fresh seasonal compote, chicken salad and Spinach Asiago open faced sandwich
Soups: All of them!! They rotate!!!
Pastry: I'm not a fan of overly sweet so I prefer the cheese and strawberry and cream cheese croissants
Drink: the best, creamiest chai in the world 

You're welcome..."}
{"text":"Wonderful and a very simple eclectic atmosphere. Very relaxing and the food was very delicious. Yes I will be back to try something new. Did I mention the spinach and bacon quiche was extremely delicious as well."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to go in Charlotte. Especially for a late night sweet tooth!! 
The delicate treats they have are so amazing. Took my boyfriend there and he loved it!! The macaroons are absolutely delicious. Great place to study and hangout."}
{"text":"So I was meeting with a client who directed me to this location. From first glance, I love the sentiment behind the \"love lock\" But then I went inside to order before my meeting so I walked in with 2 people in front of me. Before I knew it I had been standing there for 10 minutes when a cashier says, \"I'll take the next person in line. When I start to approach she says, \"no ma'am those people were in front of you. She then proceeds to tell me where the line starts which is NOT clearly posted at the entrance.  Should care less how long I had waited.  Looking astonished I just found the nearest exit and left. So I can't speak on the food but customer service was down right rude, uninviting,  and callus.  Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is awesome and the desserts are to die for! If you're in the area you have to stop! I recommend the fruit tart and macaroons."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Amélie's. Love the decor and vibe of this one! Huge location! the staff was very friendly. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on croissant and a fruit salad. Delicious! The iced salted caramel brown mocha was amazing too!!"}
{"text":"Had a great desert after eating At Midwood Smokehouse. Cannot imagine how great it is to have Carmel Salted brownies within walking distance !"}
{"text":"+2 stars for helpful service, friendly staff. They all have a very comfy level of helping - not too much, nor too little.

+4 stars for salted caramel brownies and tartine open-faced baguette with spreads alone. 

I'm sure all the other stuff is good as well."}
{"text":"Such a cute yet eccentric bakery. I like that it serves beer and wine now. I don't live in Charlotte anymore, but love visiting whenever I'm back in town. They have some of my favorite macaroons ever. Also FYI: you get a free eclair when it's your birthday!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is always a must when I have guests visiting from out of town. I have not figured out when the best time to go is though as the lines really seem to vary. 

Although the desserts stand out because they are so pretty to look at and there are so many to choose from, I'm never quite satisfied. The best options I think are the salted caramel brownie or the fruit tarts. The seasonal cakes and gateauxs tend to be dry and the macarons are fair at best. The hidden star of the menu is the quiche of the day. I'm never disappointed by it and the texture of the crust is perfect. The other thing that is a hit would be their beverages. The seasonal lemonades for those avoiding caffeine or the cafe marcottier for those needing a buzz would be my go-to choices."}
{"text":"We went to this place when we were in town visiting some friends and it was adorable. So wish we had a place like this back home. Perfect for grabbing a drink on a random day or sitting down and getting some studying or easing some. Super spacious and tons of seating. The decor is so interesting and fun to look at too. Just a great atmosphere overall!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a small pastry shop that, according to my good friend that lives in Charlotte, has become incredibly popular since they expanded their hours to 24/7 (whenever that was).  As soon as we stepped through the doors tonight, it was apparent.  The line to the cash registers extended past the entire glass casing of pastries and almost into the next room.

The bakery has an extensive selection of unique and freshly made pastries.  There are so many good looking treats to choose from, it makes deciding what to order difficult.  Fortunately, the employees are more than willing to help and describe the various sweets they offer.  I also noticed on the menu board that they serve breakfast foods, soups, sandwiches, and of course, coffees and teas.  I tried their popular salty caramel brownie.  It was thick, salty, sweet, sticky, and rich.  I could feel the cavities forming in my teeth as I chewed each bite.

The design and decor of this place is original and \"artsy.\"  There are a lot of handmade decorations, including the chandeliers.  The seating is comfortable and cozy and some of the restaurant looks more like a living room than a bakery with couches, coffee tables, lamps, and bookshelves.  Almost every seat was taken when we went, even in the atrium in the back.  The crowd was very diverse.  Live music was going on in one of the rooms."}
{"text":"I love the combo of the French decor, good coffee, double-baked chocolate croissants, and R&B jams playing in the background by the awesome staff. Oh and all steps away from work. Love it!"}
{"text":"It is alright, nothing spectacular except that the vibe is cool and open 24 hours a day.  You can sit, do takeout.  I think the food andpastries were better years ago and now they are meh."}
{"text":"We used to love Amelie's in NODA.  Cool vibe, open 24 hours and the pastries were awesome.  The soups were also very good, as well.  I hate to say that in the 5 years we have lived in Charlotte, Amelie's has gone downhill in the last year.  The coffee is not great, pastries are not very good ( maybe they have a new chef?) but really disappointed as this was our go to place in NODA for dessert or a light meal. We will try the crepe cellar next time."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly! Coffee was delicious. Haven't tried the baked goods but I've heard good things :)"}
{"text":"One word. DELICIOUS!! You absolutely cannot go wrong with the pastries at Amelie's. In addition, it's a real cool chill spot to hang out, catch up with friends, study, work...whatever. The lines stay long and the space is big enough that thankfully I'm usually able to find a seat. An absolute gem of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Their pastries and macarons are to die for! I love this place so much. It's small and cute. My boyfriend brought me here one night and I was so happy because their macarons was so soft and not hard, the little cake that I got wasn't too sweet but perfect with a milky flavor and sugary flavor to it also."}
{"text":"In short: good food, decent prices, line takes a while of they're busy

I stopped by Amelies on a friends recommendation while visiting Charlotte. I'm not a very big dessert/pastry person, nor had I ever really had French food, so it felt like a weird choice, but it was quite good.

The line was quite long when I arrived (1:30pm on a Saturday). While in line, you go ahead and order whatever pastries you want, then at the front of the line you order drinks/other food and pay for everything. 

I ordered a spinach asiago tartine ($6) and a pistachio opera torte ($5). Both were good, but the tartine was barely warm by the time it reached me, which was disappointing. 

Finding a place to sit inside was difficult; I didn't check the outside seating at all. The atmosphere is nice. I needed a place to just sit and rest a bit before I could go to my hotel, and Amelies was perfect for that."}
{"text":"This was more of a chain feeling than I expected because it's give and seems like a super cute French bakery Walmart type place. The lemonade drink was just okay and the chicken salad sandwich was good. Hubby had roast beef and it was good. The sales caramel brownie was terrific but too sweet for one sitting. Sandwich counter girl want friendly or attentive at all but the desert counter girl was very nice!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from here and it is dangerous! Such a fun place to bring out-of-town guests or if you're having a sweet craving. And they are always open! My favorite go-to items is their salted caramel brownie (to die for), chocolate croissant, napoleon or macaroons. They also have an amazing chicken salad croissant and spinach potato leek soup if you're in for lunch.

Beware that this place can get VERY busy during peak hours. Like the line wraps all the way around through their dining area. Finding a seat can be hard. Also some pastries look more appealing than they taste.

Overall such a fun and memorable place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is a darling of the south Charlotte scene. It does a great job churning out French- style pastries and bistro-ey small plates of all varieties. But, if you're going to double down on the Frenchness, you've got to do something else well: have decent bar service. And by \"decent,\" I have to explain it this way: bad service chases off one customer at a time.  Bad sanitation practice closes the restaurant all at once.

I seriously don't know how this place can't serve sugar or cream at the bar, and how they have can say that they don't have room for sugar service, when the bar is covered with scattered drink menus and uncollected service. I was told that the having to walk over to the central sweetener/dairy table provides a more \"communal\" feel, and that they could \"get [me] a belltop of sugar, I guess, if you really want it.\" I did, but it as apparent that they weren't anywhere near prepared to offer me such a service while my double-shot was still on the warm side. 

I sugared my drink and then walked back to my seat at the bar. Maybe this inconvenience made me a little more sensitive as I watched my date's cold drink being made with dirty shakers out of the dish sink (full of  a who-knows-how-old dairy spill), after I'd watched the \"baristas\" wipe my espresso cup off with the wet counter rag sitting on the cup warmer above the coffee machine, and the dumbfounded look I got when I asked the hipster guy in the skullie to remake it with clean glassware. I'm prone to think that it speaks to an overall service laziness at this place, or at least at the coffee bar. That thought was especially amplified as I stared into two open cambros of sugar (turbinado and plain old Dixie crystals) sitting DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME. 

Maybe it was an off day. The pastry side of the house always does it right (except the older, stale version of the eclair that we bought, and tossed out, once we got it home), and they've even told us the secret that they aren't ever really out of anything, you just need to insist that they go get some more from \"the back.\" This has kept us coming back. We will be back again, for pastries. But, if you want to play French, just get the basics right. Bistro tables don't make the atmosphere- good service does. A little bit of a step up in standard, and this could be a great place to eat/drink."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this location. Our first trip we had sandwiches and coffee. It was OK. Nothing spectacular. Our desserts were not good. They all tasted freezer burnt. My 13yo son ordered his drink, a café glacé, and the cashier was extremely rude to him like having a \"child\" talk to her was unacceptable. She kept looking at me instead of him. She seemed aghast that he wanted coffee and asked him at least 4 times if he \"really\" wanted an \"iced coffee\" (said very slowly). Give me a break. He is a teen standing next to his mother. Just take his order without the attitude. 

My husband and I gave them another chance for a dessert and coffee date. Our French press of coffee was delicious and beautifully served. All of the stars in this review are for that coffee. Our pastries were awful. I ordered a napoleon. The pastry, which should be flaky and crunchy, was soggy and wet. The cream filling tasted off. When my husband took it up to the register to complain the cashier took it to the back. The chef in the back looked at it and said I was wrong. Uhmm, it was dripping and clearly soggy.  The cashier begrudgingly replaced it with two macarons. The original pastry cost more than the two macarons. She did not offer any sort of equivalent or refund. Not cool. My husband had a strawberry cake type pastry. It was frozen in the middle. He picked at it but it was too solid to actually eat. My replacement macarons were OK. One was good and fresh the other was freezer burnt."}
{"text":"I'm SUPER excited that Amélies has joined the The Back Lot power stores (I just made that up) of Park Road Shopping center.  I've only been to the Uptown location way back when I first moved here a couple of years ago.  

Such a great addition to the neighborhood.  Located in the Backlot of Park Road Shopping with lot of parking.  Building is painted a pretty blue on the outside so you can't miss it! 

No need to give details about the food.  If you've been, you know it's delicious and if you haven't, GO! Lots of space to sit inside. And a nice big patio for outdoor dining.  I loveeeeeeeeee the decor.  It's like you really stepped into a cafe in France somewhere.

Again, I'm a huge fan.  You can easily come here for breakfast or early lunch and then spend the rest of the day bee-boppin' around to the other great shops!! Welcome to the hood Amélies!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for dessert this has everything you could think of! Just be prepared for  line anytime of the day.  Since we waited 20mins we got a bunch of things to try. We thought the caramel brownie was the best by far! Must have. We also got some tarts, eclair and cream puff. They were ok. Cream puff had custard which normally its a white cream so was disappointed. They were also out of most of the macaroons so we didn't get to try them. We did get some breakfast things like chocolate croissant, honey bun and cinnamon stick. The honey bun was awesome though had to warm it up the next day to soften. I plan to return to try more just think they need to figure out a better way to reduce the line size!"}
{"text":"I met someone for a business meeting at the uptown location. Wow! I was so impressed. Very large variety of yummy desserts and beverages. I believe they had lunch options, too. I had the salted caramel brownie latte. I tried to savor it, but I demolished it in the first few minutes of sitting down for our meeting."}
{"text":"Great staff! A little disappointed with the vanilla strawberry petite cake because the cake was hard and the only strawberry was the one on top...there are other options that looked wonderful but this was the only thing I tried, and for first impressions--I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Soo good! I recommend the coconut macaroon so far! Even though I'm not a coconut fan this little thing was to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review, but this review is for the uptown location. Staff are super friendly, pastries are good, service is excellent even though it's always packed.

The fact that it's 5 minutes away from my office makes it even better. I almost always do Johnny Burrito and then a coffee afterwards."}
{"text":"Amelie's came highly recommended to me by two friends for one item, their Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie, and after missing my opportunity to stop in on my first visit to Charlotte I knew that I had to set aside some time for my second trip to town. Luckily the stars aligned and I was able to stop on my most recent trip. I arrived shortly before noon and casually browsed the pastries and immediately selected one Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie and a sandwich, the Croque Monsieur.

After paying I was presented with a number and took a seat, however it didn't take long before my sandwich was ready and delivered to my table. Overall the Croque Monsieur was delicious, and the croissant was wonderfully light with a flaky exterior and soft interior, however the ham was just as good. While the sandwich was on the small size it was enough to fill my appetite as I was catching a flight home just two hours later. Next up was the Chocolate Salted Caramel Brownie, I simply cannot say anything more than you have to order this sweet treat, it was so good I considered taking some along with me through TSA, however if they knew what I was carrying I doubt it would have made its way through the checkpoint!

Anyways the food and service here were great and I fully intend on returning next time I am in town."}
{"text":"So happy there is a new location for those in South Charlotte. I actually like this location so much more! Here's why: 

1. More spacious layout- it's more open than the other Amelie's in NoDa. 
2. Not as crowded, easier to find a table! 
3. Same lovely decor and food as the other Amelie's.
4. Outdoor seating 

As for the food, I've been to Amelie's so many times to know what's good now. The salted caramel brownies are a must try- they are a bit heavy though so splitting one is a perfect amount. I love the macaroons there! The fruit tarts are cute but I don't think they are worth the price. Also, the creme brûlée isn't that worth it either. I would try the other desserts that aren't as sweet like croissants! 

**free wifi!"}
{"text":"After watching The Most Incredible Thing on two different days, a ballet at the Knight Theater, we headed over to Amelie's Cafe both times. The cafe is a couple of blocks away and is easy to walk to.

The first time was after opening night, so it was likely around 22:00 when we arrived. It was busy. I ended up reserving a table for us by plopping our coats and my purse on our three comfy chairs. I didn't do any ordering, but I wanted the iced lavender drink with honey.

Both my friends came back about fifteen minutes later. The lineup was long. An older man with his date joked that he'd come sit with me. I had a snappy comeback which made them both laugh.

They came back with my beverage. They also got the following:
- Petit fours, consisting of chocolate mousse, lemon, chocolate strawberry cups, and pistachio
- Strawberry rhubarb almond cake
- Vanilla strawberry cheesecake

They joined me at the table. We chatted and shared all the decent, scrumptious desserts. Like the first time at this cafe in Rock Hill, everything I had was divine. They weren't overly sweet. They were perfect.

It was during our stay at this cafe that we booked our tickets to the ballet the following afternoon. My friend did the booking and I offered to charge it to my credit card. Ah, teamwork!

After the matinee show on Sunday, we went for a late lunch first, and then decided to hit this cafe again. We thought of having a movie night at the hotel, and indulge in pastries and more together.

I was fortunate to participate in selecting goodies for us. Collectively, we got the following:
- Bread pudding
- Napoleon
- Two key lime tarts
- Dark chocolate raspberry tart

I am not a huge fan of the Napoleon to begin with. One of my friends ordered it, which was huge. I ended up being stuck with the remaining piece after they both headed home. I loved everything else. Nothing was left, except the bread pudding. I actually brought it back to Markham and ate it! It had chocolate mixed in, which was so yummy.

This bakery has a cafe in Rock Hill, SC; and another in Atlanta, GA. The remaining locations are in Charlotte, which is another good reason to return for a future visit.

If you are ever in Charlotte, I recommend coming here to either chat, have a cup of coffee, or get dessert to take with you. It's all good no matter what you do.

{"text":"Becoming... NO, is a charlotte staple. I have frequent the original local on many occasions. I have seen bible study, women meeting, and girls hanging out, People with dyed hair, no hair, and wings, pre-med Student studying and groups catching up. This is an inclusive space and more importantly a safe one. I am actually a fan of their pastries although my friends would beg to differ. They love the savory soups and sandwiches. I started my Amelie affection based on the tart (hazelnut was my fav) but have shifted to their palmers, macrons and recently sticky buns. They have an eclectic variety of options made fresh daily and with that being said it can be hit or miss on the available options. Be open-minded while going as the prices are not for the faint of heart. The décor is cute and Parisian inspired which is a cute homage. Now that they have branched out I have found that there are more locations in and around charlotte and can always sneak in for a quite bite, download, coffee or chat with friends. I highly suggest you give it a try. Don't be surprised if you being to plan your next vaca to Paris. Bonjour!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure.  Did make the mistake of going on a Saturday night.  So crowded.  Enjoyed my turkey and brie sandwich - need to branch out. Did not go back for dessert because the line was off the hook.  Salted caramel brownie still my favorite - the stuff of which dreams are made!"}
{"text":"Camden Ballantyne has excellent customer service and a friendly staff that go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. I moved in a few days ago and unexpectedly had a chirping fire detector at 830pm that sent my dog into a panic attack. I was so pleased with the customer service that the community manager provided me on the phone. She quickly took my request, expediting it to emergency status since it was after hours and put me on hold while she contacted the technician and got back to me with an expected time for service. The technician had to drive in 45 minutes away to change it the batteries (my ceilings are over 10 ft tall) He so was nice and even brought an air filter for another maintenance request I had put in for as well! Overall, I have never experienced this level of customer service at an apartment community before and wanted to say THANK YOU! For making my first few days here so pleasant and welcoming. I will definitely be recommending this community to others. Your raving fan!"}
{"text":"I'm just not into so so pastries , treating your help badly and spending too much money and not getting a seat."}
{"text":"It's been several weeks since this location opened and I was surprised that they open so early on a Sunday. Came here to get breakfast/coffee and work on my final exam. Busy for 9am on a Sunday morning but the Panthers have a home game so I assume that contributes a good crowd. Line system is a bit confusing. If you want anything from the pastry case + coffee get in the line along the case (furthest from the door). Service is very friendly, food is yummy (ate it too quick to get pictures). I had a blueberry muffin and a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with iced coffee. Everything was delicious! Plus there's TONS of seating so I was able to find a quiet space to do homework. I will DEFINITELY be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is awesome, the perfect taste of France amidst the beauty of downtown Charlotte.  I enjoyed a delicious latte and buttery croissant while relaxing at the bar and interacting with the pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I have been to the local one at Carmel Commons twice. Both times the food was BLAND. I had the Black Forest Sandwich the first time. It was just OK -- the potato salad was very very bland. Last Sunday we returned with friends. Very disorganized, cashier didn't seem to know what she was doing or what sides were offered (this happened both visits). I order the Turkey with Bacon sandwich it was tasty but again the Potato salad was very bland. I've heard the hype, all I've seen is bland and chaotic. For me this is a NO GO."}
{"text":"Delicious. The pastries are unreal and truly remind me of being in France. The food is also very good but I truly recommend Amelie's for the pastries and sweets. Wonderful place with great treats and a fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back, whether that be at the Uptown location or their original location near NODA."}
{"text":"This sweet bakery is so delicious. Every time I go into the restaurant for a quick coffee or to pick up lunch it's impossible to get out of there without a delicious dessert! I am obsessed with their eclairs and even their tarts! They are truly made like the French tarts I enjoy every time I go to Europe.

 I am looking forward to going back for dessert in the near future! It's such a great place to pick up a dessert to accompany any home made dinner not to mention how great the food and coffee is on top of everything else!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe but the food isn't worth the hype. At all."}
{"text":"When I just can't even any more I like to go to Amelie's. This is the perfect place to wrap yourself in your infinity scarf, read a good book and sip on your coffee while using their free wifi. The atmosphere is quaint. Almost TOO quaint. Like \"Am I supposed to live here now? It's so cozy.\"

This is a great place to bring your headphones and an electronic device of your choice with you. Surrounded by fellow patrons in yoga pants and Uggs you will feel right at home. The cashier recognized my Rick and Morty t-shirt and we had a hilarious conversation about how much her son loves the show. You had to be there.

They are hidden away in the back of the Park Road Shopping Center so if your map app doesn't get you there don't give up. You are so close. I've only ordered coffee and breakfast sandwiches from here so far but I hear they have great pastries. Perhaps next visit. Oh, there will be a next visit.

Sidenote: Sean King I know you're reading this. Unblock me on Twitter. Not cool bro."}
{"text":"So so so so good. The chicken salad on a wonderful croissant is so yummy...not to mention all of the pastries that they offer. Always a tough decision on what to get but it is ALWAYS good."}
{"text":"Love this place. I can sit at the bar and have a glass of wine which is nice. The ham and Gruyere tartine is so delicious. All in all a great place to stop for a glass of wine and some awesome food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this location.  The décor is very nice and it is a fairly large space.  I like the outdoor, covered patio as well.  They serve wine and beer here, which they do not at the original location.  I have noticed that it is not as crowded here as the original spot, and the wait time is less.  I really don't care for most of the desserts at Amelie's period.  I think they are hard and lacking taste.  However, I do enjoy the seasonal drinks and sandwiches.  Lunch here is a good idea always.  The soups are always good as well."}
{"text":"Fun and charming atmosphere. The service is always good. Some of the lunch sandwiches are a little pricey but always delicious. I'm not thrilled with a lot of the desserts for the price. All the ones I've tried are just a disappointment. Too rich, or not as tasty as expected, and very pricey. One I do enjoy is the almond twice baked croissant.  Drinks are all good and worth trying."}
{"text":"Very cool location! The inside is huge and so unique.  I love the layout.  The food and desserts are the same of course.  So nothing different to comment on there.  I wish they were open 24 hrs like the original NoDA location.  The parking is. Little tough.  Most likely in a garage or down the starlet a bit is the best bet.  You may have to walk to get there, but that's ok."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit this cafe because I heard from a couple of people great this place is. Not only do they have delicious food and drinks, but the decor is on point. From every single chair being different to adorable paintings on the wall, the ambience here is really great.

I went with a breakfast sandwich and a peach tart. Both incredibly delicious. The sandwich was simple, yet decedent. I got mine with asiago cheese, bacon and eggs. Soooo good. Because I'm a fatty and needed something sweet too, I went with the peach tart. It was perfect and I don't have a negative thing to say about it - or this establishment. 

Definitely a must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Macaron heaven. The cotton candy, strawberry, pistachio and every other flavor macaron will speak to your soul. They are known for their salted caramel brownie. Also a delicious choice. We also got fruit tarted and peach tartes. I'm in town for a week and have been there a few times now to get pastry and lunch. The baguettes are sublime. The honey Dijon sandwich is excellent with the crunchy apple. The soups are made there and they always have a special quiche for the day. There is so much to choose from and i definitely recommend the Paris tea. I enjoy to sit outside. It gets busy for lunch but the line moves. The strawberry salad with goat cheese and carmalized almonds is also a delicious choice with the balsamic dressing. I honestly look forward to going back each day. This place speaks to my soul. There is a panera across the street and i can't understand why people are even eating there as opposed to eating at Amélie's everyday. Go to Amélie's, try all different things and take your time. You will not be disappointed what so ever!"}
{"text":"Great place cool vibe awesome decorations and the food is fantastic. Amazing pastries I'm a connoisseur of croissants and my wife is a chunky for pies and tarts. We both enjoy the atmosphere the music and the service. We would recommend this location and even more the one in uptown which is three times as big and centrally located to all around uptown is a must check out place if you go to Charlotte for breakfast lunch or dinner when you're in the mood for a French feel."}
{"text":"I went for the salted caramel brownie. It was very good. The brownie was soft and creamy with a thick layer of salted caramel. Melted in my mouth. I also tried an apricot pastry. There wasn't much apricot in it though it was flakey.  A cute place with tables inside and out."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with this place. I went for desserts on my lunch break and must say they had lots to choose from, but I just didn't taste anything that makes me eager to go back. I ordered a caramel machiatto and it was small and overpriced. I just don't think this place is for me."}
{"text":"The cutest, most unique bakery! A little pricey with the coffee & some desserts, but what do you expect for downtown Charlotte and amazing quality treats? Parking was a little complicated; we ended up in a parking deck and had to walk a block or so, but if you can snag a spot, there is street parking in front of Amélie's! 

Will definitely be back. Amazing french macarons!"}
{"text":"I suspect that heaven will be filled with Amelie's salted caramel brownies.  A must try for foodies."}
{"text":"Hard to review Amelie's. It's so awesome, unique, good for CLT, comfy, all around kick ass, that I gotta go after the nits. Which are:

Table immediately inside the door so that would-be lunchers break left and right, confused, and have to spend a sec asking \"are you in line?\" 

More than occasional space cadet order takers

Price inflexibility (adding things to, say, a lunch tartine can run you upwards of 2 bucks, if they let you do it at all)

But, I never leave here having spent less than $10, and my theory is that there's some sort of weird hypnosis that gorgeous case of pastries triggers. All the color and perfect chocolate swirls, perhaps... anyways, when I come to, I've got not only my coffee and sammich but also a baguette, cup of soup and tart tucked under my arm (well, in a box, anyway).

Take it from an NYC pastry hunter - prices on tarts, cream puffs, macaroons, etc. are reasonable, darlings. A perfect eclair is an extensive and laborious process.

The vegan soup is deeelish, as are their other choices (seems there's always a veg or vegan option, so yay!).

And 24hrs? Quelle bonne idée!"}
{"text":"I attend for coffee quite a bit due to it being close to work. Always a great atmosphere. Only downside is the wait sometimes even if it's not very busy."}
{"text":"This is a really great bakery!  Although their assortment is not huge, the quality and freshness more than makes up for it!  They have an excellent atmosphere too!  The bakery is very inviting and is a great place to hang out.  Just be prepared to fight the crowds.  When went, I lucked out.  I got there just after they had finished serving a huge wave of people.  After I found a place to sit, I went back in for a napkin and saw there a line had formed going out the door.  I am sure I will be going back here!"}
{"text":"Food and Drinks are great! Service was a little disappointing, I could not stop saying how adorable the place was and how great everything was and no one was friendly or seemed to want to be there... I got the breakfast sandwich and a brownie coffee drink, everything was really great! I will go back and just hope for better service next time.."}
{"text":"I love this place. Last weekend I went in at 11:30pm and there were tons of ppl enjoying and socializing. Prices are great and desserts are to die for. YUMMMM ME!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The only downside is that it's busy.  They have more seating in an atrium area, but it is hotter than the main seating area.  The coffee is pretty good but the bake goods are outstanding.  The internet connection is reliable and free.  The cliental is mostly hipsters.  The staff is friendly and have always thanked me if I leave a tip (even if it's only a dollar).  This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this bakery, and giving it only four stars feels wrong BUT I have to admit, some of the pastries are not quite what I expected them to be. My fool proof go-to is the salted caramel brownie. I'm a huge fan of French Macaroons, but sometimes the cookie here is a little too chewy or clumpy and it kind of ruins it for me. 

If you're looking for somewhere to try new things, drink some good coffee or have quality time with friends. I recommend you do it here. I personally find it hard to do homework in a place where all I can smell is cinnamon things but that's just me. I have no will power. 

P.S: If you're planning on going between the hours of any day whatsoever at anytime, be prepare to stand in a line ranging from 10 people, to the length of humans it would take to equal the span of the Great Wall of China. Not even Mark Wahlberg can cut that line for you."}
{"text":"First time in after a wonderful lunch around the corner.
We ordered 2 coffee drinks and some pastries. Waited 12 minutes for our coffees to be made. Small crowd came in after we placed our order so no excuse. One guy with one assistant making hot beverages.  Won't make this mistake again. 
On the plus side the cafe is very inviting with French decor and plenty of seating. Make sure u prepare your coffee upstairs as there is no \"station\" downstairs if you need extra sugar etc....that could use a tweak.
Pastries were good."}
{"text":"Really great ambiance for chatting with friends. Turkey and Brie sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"The yelp mark is in the wrong spot, as it's located in the \"backlot\" of park road (behind Michaels), but it's easy to find once you're here! 

Amelie's, simple, delicious and elegant. I actually don't think there is a bad thing to say about this place. From the mixed up, funky decor to the elegant pastries, it has something for everyone. There's ample room at this location, like all their others, with enough spaces to work where you don't feel like you're taking up too much space. They also brew pure intentions coffee, which is a favorite and added bonus. Come and check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great option for a quick and inexpensive lunch when you're working uptown in Charlotte. 

Daily lunch specials are always the best or you can create your own deli-style sandwich. My fav is their  toasted BLT

Sweets galore too if you just have to have a sugar fix!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and all the pastries! 

The location is convienent; the decor is eclectic."}
{"text":"Great delicacies. I love their napoleon. Great place to socialize and network!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to Amelie's and their bakery items simply cannot be beat. I HIGHLY recommend the salted caramel brownie. I seriously considered skipping lunch and just eating, like, 3 of these! Their sandwiches and soups are also fresh and delicious. Amelie's is a must if you are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Oh Amelie's! I love you! You are so near and dear, and close to my heart. Shall I write you a poem? Maybe another time. Yeah...seriously, Amelie's is a not just a cafe. It is a cultural phenomenon. Where else can you get yummy homemade soup, tasty desserts, coffee, and excellent people watching in Charlotte at 3 am in the morning? Amelie's is open 24/7. So bring your laptop or book, and prepare for an escape into a magical wonderland where all of the food is good, and you can meet some pretty cool people."}
{"text":"Not a good performance for Amélie's. Not sure if it is the location or what. 

Eclair was dry, over cooked, no cream. Disappointing really. 

I usually enjoy the stop, but not today!"}
{"text":"I think people go here for the look and feel plus environment. It sure did have unique decorations and very spacious, lots of tables for work and hangouts.

The $2.29 macarons were larger than usual macarons but didn't taste fresh, doesn't have that moist feel. It was just crunchy and harden.

I didn't eat a lot of the other pastries but my boyfriend wasn't hugely impressed.

For the long line that wrapped around the corner, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"LONG LINES!  But it's so worth it.  This dessert bar is every sweet tooth's dream, and it's open 24 HOURS!!!!!!!   Everything I tried is delish.  Their tarts, mini mousse, macaroons.  They have delicious creme brûlée and the best Napoleon I have ever tasted.  5 Stars and nothing less!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Such good sweet treats and coffee.  The quiche is awesome too."}
{"text":"Back in theday I used to love Amelies, and would make my way there once a week!  Now even with a craving, it's a chore almost to go.  I hate feeling rushed and overwhelmed.  No one wants to be pressured into purchasing the wrong thing.  I'm not saying that I need 30 mins to to make a choice but jeeze is like an assembly line.  They NEED to figure out a more effective layout of the dessert area/line etc. I'm sure it's possible!  It's hard especially when you invited someone thats never been before and they can't order because you either can't see anything or asking questions seems to be annoying to them now!"}
{"text":"This is a go to when I have friends from out of town. They're always impress with the eclectic and fun ambiance. Get the salted brownie or the Napoleon. Great breakfast and lunch sandwiches as well. The chocolate mouse cup is my fav. However, every time I have gotten a cake it has been dry and disappointing. My go to for desserts! Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice café with a nice variety of pastries, baked items, desserts. From croissants to tartes and crême brûlée, they have it all!

I was disappointed that at 8 pm, they were out of almost everything. They are open late night, and should be able to gage numbers better. It's not as cozy as the other location, but it's spacious with lots of tables."}
{"text":"This is so far my favorite dessert and cafe shop in Charlotte. The desserts are not too sweet-- sweetness is perfect. The coffee are also strong and tasteful."}
{"text":"Discovering Amélie's is dangerous! Everything is delicious and there are so many options!  If you're looking to treat yourself this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Third location that I've visited during opening week. No doubt this place is making money. Their service is incredible and I personally love that I can get a lot of work done here while enjoying the vibe/atmosphere. Definitely feels more open than their Carmel Commons location. The menu is easier to read here at this location as well. Stop in, enjoy some coffee, or your favorite sweets, but most of all be kind for everyone you encounter here. The world needs more of that don't you think?"}
{"text":"When in downtown Charlotte, you must come here.   No wonder the place is hoppin' and poppin' at 9 am!     We tried their salted caramel brownie, berry tart and chocolate eclair....and almost died from the pure taste of it all.   There isn't a bad dessert at this place and the ambiance and staff are both vibrant, humming and just happy to be there.    If we had had more time, we would have made a repeat stop!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Great for studying, relaxing, or hanging with friends. They have great food, great coffee, and great atmosphere. But the thing I like the best? They sell Sprecher sodas, which this Milwaukee girl didn't know she could get outside of Wisconsin. Plus, it's open 24 hours a day! What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you have any type of food allergy!!! They will make substitutions to food without customers knowledge even after they were notified about an allergy. The food is good here just not worth a trip to the hospital for."}
{"text":"What a surprising, pseudo-swanky fall-into-the-rabbit-hole coffee and dessert place. Grant L took us for a taste of Charlotte.

The coffee was pretty tasty, and I'm not a dessert eater but the Napoleon looked too decadent to pass up. It was huge, probably 5-6\" long, flaky fresh and stuffed with delicious pastry cream. I couldn't finish half of it. Heaven!

The star of the show is really the whimsical interior, with a mismatched Alice in Wonderland meets the Mad Hatter meets the Queen of Hearts and Mona Lisa at the pseudo-Versailles kind of vibe. It's bigger than it appears from the outside.

Really for adults of all ages, but it's quiet, cozy, eclectic... full of collegiate and twenty-something hipsters on their laptops and iPads. I guess I fit right in!  ?!? =p"}
{"text":"People with Sweet tooth , be careful! ;)
My favorites are breakfast sandwich, macaroons, coffee, and their herbal tea. 
Best part is about sitting there working or reading."}
{"text":"OMG! Fantastic place for pastries,sandwiches and quiches! Took home some Brioche bread to make some French Toast with. Plenty of sitting. Staff are very friendly. Don't leave without trying the Carmel Brownie with Sea salt!"}
{"text":"Simply lovely. 

I've tried it all -- pastries, sandwiches, soups.... and it's ALL good."}
{"text":"My friend who recently moved to Charlotte raved about this place. She took our group here for some treats while we were in town for another friend's Bachelorette party. We arrived around 9 pm on Saturday night and there was a long line that wrapped all the way to the back of the building. Definitely made us all believe the goodies had to be awesome. And they were. The salted caramel brownie was fantastic, and definitely something I would order again if I lived in the area. Loved the décor inside the NoDa location too. Super kitchy and very cozy- would be a perfect place to spend a Saturday afternoon with a good book. I wasn't super impressed with the buttercream that adorned the strawberry mini cake I ordered, but that might just be my personal taste- I prefer a buttercream that is slightly sweeter rather than buttery."}
{"text":"5 Stars!  Amazing pastries and sweets with great coffee/ tea.  This was great place to enjoy desert after having dinner.  Service is great and they work as a team to keep the line moving quickly."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with the family after being recommended this stop by a co-worker.  

We got a box of various desserts and pastries  (salted caramel brownie, two different crossiants and an eclair). 

I also ordered an iced coffee and was pleased with its flavor.  They sweetened it with something that tasted similar to honey which I liked. 

I would highly recommend this spot to anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"I loved having a nice late evening chat with my friend here. We shared their famous salted caramel brownie and I also had an iced lavender latte. The brownie had the perfect texture and was a delicious dessert, and the lavender latte was exactly what I wanted. 

Amélie's has a super cute and interesting ambiance. Pay special attention to their unique collection of chandeliers. You could spend quite some time here just looking around."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this restaurant and bakery, because I would eat there often.  Beautiful bakery, International coffees, the best soup I have had in a while, perfect French bread, and a lovely quiche.  Order at the counter and food is delivered to your table.  Cute French decor and a Marie Antionette cutout for photos, plenty of seating, private parking lot plus easy street parking.

Before or after you go to Amelie's, check out Atlanta Contemporary Art (2 blocks away) to see exhibits there.  They are open every day and entry is free, but check hours beforehand."}
{"text":"My wife tried to get a custom 50th Bday cake for me starting 3 weeks out. She was directed to catering because of the size of the order and was told the lady that handled was in vacation but would get in touch when she returned.  They only require 48 hrs notice so she thought NP.  Never heard back and more than 5 calls later each time talking to an actual person and told she'd call or txt or email in like 5 mins and that it was on the books and they apologized and they couldn't believe she still hadn't gotten in touch with her.  She told them repeatedly that if they couldn't do it or didn't want the biz just to let her know so she wasn't in a bind with no cake last minute and they said no NO we'll take care of it.  Long story long Horrible experience and our her in a last minute frenzy but Renaissance Patisserie came through at the last minute. They were awesome and the cake turned out great.  We highly recommend them!  And btw...still never heard from Amelie's she never even called to apologize."}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place. And the smells!! I had the mini fruit tart and mini pecan pie. I wish i had ordered the large size of the pie. So darn good."}
{"text":"A very fun place to hang out. I like the different rooms of the NoDa location, but feel like these guys have done really well with the decor with the space they have. It's a little pricey, but fun to visit. My teenage son loves the macaroons. The soup is usually pretty good (not the best, but nice that they have different options). The sandwiches are good too."}
{"text":"Great coffee and sweet treats. A great place to hang out down town Charlotte and always has a great atmosphere. There is always a great collection of French art too. They are also open late nights too."}
{"text":"I met up with a couple of friends while on my somewhat annual Christmas trip to Charlotte.  My friends were late due to traffic and laundry, so I sat in Amelie's on a couch by the door for about an hour (yeah, I know) and the staff didn't even care!  THIS IS A GOOD THING. I didn't get any dirty looks for not buying anything, nor did I get asked if I wanted anything.  They just let me sit there and wait.  And people watch.  

The vibe of Amelie's is really laid back... One of my friends (can't remember who, sorry!) said that it was like a \"little piece of Boone in Charlotte.\"  I wouldn't really say all that, but I definitely appreciated the mix of clientele from people getting off of work from their corporate jobs to hipsters coming to hang out, to young parents coming to pick up snacks, to whoever else happened to walk in to get anything ranging from coffee to a loaf of French bread.  I stayed for quite a while with my friends (again, not a problem with the staff at all) and was good with it all until about 10 pm, where the crowd seemed to gravitate more towards groups kids (I can say kids, right?) who are excited to not be at home with their parents and people dressed up for the skanky Charlotte bar scene.  That's when my friend and I finally took our queue to leave...

...But not before having a cup of awesome coffee, a croque monsieur, a fruit tie, a salted caramel brownie, a cup of earl gray, and a croissant... I told you, I was there for a while... Probably like 5 or 6 hours.  The food was all delicious.  The croque monsieur had a little more mustard than I would've liked, but I'm not a fan of mustard... The salted caramel brownie was AMAZING.  It was perfectly sized and had equal parts salted caramel and fudgy brownie.  The croissant just tempted my from the display case, so I HAD to eat it... The fruit tie?  While ginormous, I prefer the kolochies (totally butchered that word, but hey, I'm not Polish) made by the locals in Chicago. 

Final verdict:  I'll be bringing Joe the next time we go to NC and the food is kinda pricey I guess and nothing out of this world (except that brownie), but the atmosphere is totally worth it."}
{"text":"It was an awfully long line for something that was good, but not amazing. I was really expecting something spectacular with how busy this place is all of the time.  We tried 4-5 different items and again good, but not worth a return visit for me. Really long lines, no parking."}
{"text":"What an experience. From the time you walk through the door you know that you are in someplace special. The décor may be funky but the pastries are definitely fresh. If you like fresh pastries this a place that must be visited."}
{"text":"Excellent pastries, solid espresso. Went for a birthday party which was in the Versailles room in the back. Awesome decor. Overall a great experience, minus one star for the server. Seemed to be overcharging on a couple of things and sorta ruined the end of the night, even called security because he felt \"threatened\". Man up dude. Not the way to treat guest spending good money. 

Saw a ton of young people with their laptops just hanging out, studying, etc. Seems to be a poppin spot to take a date or just hang out in general. The line was crazy. It was to the back on a Saturday at like 7pm. They definitely make a killing here. Worth coming back. 

Try the sandwiches, the croissants were super soft and flaky. Delicious"}
{"text":"This is not a true French Bakery (please check out Christophe's in Charleston for comparison). The espresso was terrible, the ambiance worse.  I know and love French people and could not fathom the misguided decor disaster, which I found offensive rather than a funky American take on French style. The paintings were not \"improved,\" rather, I felt they were vandalized. 

Aside from aesthetics, I was not a fan of the ambiance either. It must appeal to many people as this place has franchised. The chocolate croissant was edible but seemed to be frozen and baked on site rather than fresh. Disappointing overall."}
{"text":"I went back and got the fruit tarts and chocolate cinnamon & pistachio macarons. Friends I shared with said they were all super delicious! I tried a bite of the peach tart and it was good! Loved the crust and almond creamy base. 

The staff members were definitely more helpful this time. Labor Day must've been an off day."}
{"text":"Awesome Camille was VERY nice and friendly!!! Love the original location but this one is nice as well. This was my first time here and we brought my friends from out of town by to see. Everyone loved the sweets and had a blast. We will definitely me back!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the desserts and I ordered the pear tart. The tart was delicious, but wasn't my first choice. Maybe it was the time I had arrived, 7 pm or so, but there were no lemon flavored desserts , no lemon tarts , bars or cakes. Fine... i'll change my order, but hard for pregnant woman to change her cravings... just saying. So then I saw the apple tart, but instead it was a pear tart that was in the apple tart's place. So not wanting to be super difficult, I went with the pear tart with the flaky, buttery crust.. It was a delicious dessert - could have been easily shared, but who would want to do that. 

You will have to order at the counter  - this place is a bakery/restaurant/cafe. It is decorated so eclectically but the furniture in the restaurant is a little worn."}
{"text":"I  really enjoy Amalie's! They always have the best quality desserts that are not just delicious, super pretty too!! They also have AAAAAAMAZING coffee!!!!!"}
{"text":"The new Park Road Shopping Center location is absolutely gorgeous.  It is in the back lot.  The large venue will be perfect for showers and parties.  The signature Amelie's decor continues in this location.  It is so well done and so much to look at.  

But let's talk about the real reason we go to Amelie's....SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIES and MACARONS.   I am pretty sure if you could taste heaven it would taste exactly like an Amelie's macaron."}
{"text":"I honestly wish I hadn't been so awe struck so I could have remembered to take photos. 

This bakery was amazing! My macaroons were perfect. The tea was delicious and the customer service was on point. Honestly something anyone in town should see.
I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in NC."}
{"text":"Great because they are open late. Service can be a little slow if you order anything other than pastries from the case. But everything is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had friends visiting in town and wanted to take them to a chill spot with good treats, so I went to Amelie's in Noda. I love that this place is open 24 hours and they have free WiFi and an opened courtyard area.  Not to mention they have a huge selection of desserts and pastries.  Whenever I want a late night snack.... this is my go to spot."}
{"text":"Amazing. My husband and I honestly schedule flights out of Charlotte just so we can swing by on the way to or from our trips."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Amelie's.  I have taken out of town guests here many times and they have really enjoyed it too.  It's convenient that it's open 24 hours, BUT it does get very busy at times where you have to wait in line.  The prices are not cheap but you are paying for quality and delicious, authentic French sweets.  My one complaint is that on more than one occasion we could not easily find somewhere to sit because it was so busy.  Try the salted caramel brownie!"}
{"text":"Very nice location! Of course I love the deserts here. Breakfast and lunch sandwiches are also excellent. 

Unfortunately shortly after they opened the mooching tip jars came out by the cashiers. Really, we tip cashiers now? I walk up to the counter and place my order. Paid with credit card. Cashier hands me the slip and says, \"fill out the tip and total and sign please\". I put zero in for tip before I stood in another line to wait for my food.

As a young person I worked every position in a restaurant. There are \"tip\" positions and \"non-tip\" positions. Tips are for providing service at a table.

I suppose it's only a matter of time before Burger King has a tip jar at the drive through window."}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastries.  The Cafe Creme is my favorite when I'm visiting from Seattle."}
{"text":"Amelie's French Bakery is exactly where it should be, in the art district NoDa. The place is fantastic and I wish I could eat here everyday. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing and priced reasonably. The decor is eclectic and fun. I can't wait until I'm on that side of town so I can drop in and indulge in a delicious pastry."}
{"text":"Very cute French bakery. The inside is decorated like you were in a actual french bakery. Many bakery options from macaroons to brownies and even coffee and tea options. I enjoyed coming here. To my surprise I actually really liked the Carmel brownie over the macaroons. It is a cute place and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I like to visit Amelie's from time to time and enjoy going infrequently. Sometimes I'm less than impressed with the quality and freshness of their baked goods for the price you pay. Coffee is always good and I love their late, late hours. Wish they'd offer some lighter less sweet baked goods for when you don't really want sugar/butter overkill."}
{"text":"Went for late night coffee and dessert  after a movie was packed and service was working their tails off. I think I could have ordered everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Have tried a lot of the pastries and most are great but I have found the service to be quite hit or miss. Sandwiches are tasty but small. Until I can find another option to get french macaroons, I'll keep going there."}
{"text":"The first dessert place I think of in Charlotte to suggest to anyone is Amelie's Bakery! 

They are restlessly great every single time. The space downtown is huge and the French theme is eye catching. 

I always find something new to look at when I go there. The best desserts to me is everything of course! But if I had to choose three I would go with the Salted Carmel Brownie, The Napoleon, and Small Pecan Pie. 

My next favorites are the macaroons !

You really can't go wrong at this place  and that is why the line is usually long but worth the wait. The downtown location is busier during working hours vs late night like the NODA location."}
{"text":"I'm from CA on a business trip therefore I wanted something to do in NC and Yelp was a lot of help in finding Amelie's! However I can not say the same for the staff at Amelie's! I order my tart and coffee and was told they would take it to my table. Well I never got my coffee bc no one told me that I had to pick it up at the coffee bar and no one was nice enough to take it to my table! On other bad note! I wanted to buy some of there tarts and take them back to CA to give to my friends and staff! However this same staff told me that they do not have any boxes to put them that would help with the air flight. She did not ever try to help me! To bad for her bc I wanted to buy enough for 50 members of my staff! Wow someone does not like making money! That's ok bc I could always take my business where it is welcome!"}
{"text":"Delicious treats galore! As everyone does, I recommend the salted caramel brownie and their chicken salad sandwich! So good and a great hangout place. Especially when's there's nothing to do at 3 am!"}
{"text":"the truth is in the soup. the pastries are AMAZING but the soup, though? the SOUP!?! the Spinach Asparagus Leek is my all time fave, I order that every time I catch it on the menu. and the tomato is delicious from a bowl or a glass (bloody mary anyone?) 
This is one of the best spots in CLT no matter what time it is. So go... and bring me back some soup?"}
{"text":"I always make a stop at Amélie's when I'm in Charlotte. The salted caramel brownie is the most decadent, creamy, crunchy, chocolatey, sweet dessert! It's the best $2 bucks I've spent all weekend. There's macarons, croissants, fruit tarts, cream puffs, coffees, teas, and soup. I love the asparagus and spinach soup. This location has a nice patio but the interior decor is where you really want to snag a seat. There's boatloads of fun, French inspired decorations and a merch table near the pasty case if you can't leave without a t-shirt or reusable bag. Overall a nice place to sit alone or with a date!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of the spinach Asiago tartine as it was just a bunch of spinach spooned onto a French bread with cheese melted on top... probably better value to get a sandwich instead as a whole tartine was $5.99. The fruit tart on the other hand was amazing!!!!!!! Literally craving it again."}
{"text":"After waiting over 30 minutes for a quarter baguette, I went up to the front to remind the cashier that I never received my food.  I was told they were out of the spread I wanted.....after 30 minutes.  I would have been fine with another spread, but I had to go home, so I left without a refund and with an empty stomach.  I love Amelie's but I won't be coming back to this one.  Noda seems to be the only location with excellent service."}
{"text":"Great place for pastries, coffee, and a very unique place if you want to get away from the local starbucks! Atmosphere is casual and provides a cool little get away to work if you can do that kind of thing!"}
{"text":"I just love breakfast here! Their cafe petit is always on point and my go to here, it pairs well with any pastry or breakfast sandwich!
The daily quiche specials are also one of my go-to's. Great spot to meet for any occasion, and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating at the Park Rd. location."}
{"text":"Out of the two locations for Amelie's, this is my favorite... It's just so much easier to park than the South Tryon location... lol (That may make me sound super lazy, but I'm okay with that...) 

Let's see... At this location, I like hanging out and enjoying the vibe... It's a really relaxed place with a café type feel... I enjoy getting to just take a breather and experience the treats...

My favorite things at Amelie's:

- Caramel Salted Brownie:  I was a little weirded out by this when I saw the description the first time, I have to admit... Luckily, I'm making myself try new things all the time, so I was able to revel in the absolute delight of this dessert... Sweet and salty are the new little black dress... It just works.
- Apricot Fruit Tie:  It looks like a long croissant with some fruit filling in the middle, in my opinion... I'm not making it sound as delicious as it is with this description, but the pastry is so flaky and the filling is sweet...  It is absolutely fabulous... Highly recommended...
- Latte:  I need my caffeine... This just happens to be delicious as well and I'll take that any day of the week...
- Comfy seating: It's not just random wooden chairs in here... And if you're sitting for a while, things like that matter...

I don't get to the area as much as I used to, but when I do get my late night hang out on in NoDa, Amelie's is a great nightcap..."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Amelie's for years.  Their pastries are by far some of the best in Charlotte.  I recently discovered the Uptown location, and frequent it often for breakfast and lunch.  This time I had the Apple, Bacon and Pecan Salad with Salmon - DELICIOUS!  I also got, which I get every time, creme brulee (my FAVORITE dessert).  This time I tried the Hazelnut (Brandi and another employee suggested I try) - THE BEST EVER!!!  

If you've never been to Amelie's you must go - the ambience alone is a must see!!"}
{"text":"Great drink and dessert options. Opened 24 hours which makes it a nice place get work done. Finding a good spot can get tricky at times. Still, it's always an experience when I come here."}
{"text":"Quirky, cute, spacious...sooo much eye candy! From all the outsider art and mosaics to the pastries and sandwiches. All around a perfect stop for lunch DOWNTOWN Charlotte"}
{"text":"Their tarts are fantastic but the true measure of a french cafe are the Eclairs; they put there stamp on them for crying out loud. I've been to everyone location and the pate a choux was overcooked or BURNT every time. Im in the industry I get it, you forget the last tray or the oven's too hot the first batch but, you DON'T serve those. There is literally a waste sheet for that!! Worse than burnt product is the apathy served by the staff when you draw their attention to the problem. When a customer points out a flaw in service FIX it. I will not be back til they do!!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and only now have the chance to comment: I love this place and it welcomed me to the Queen City, son it's a classic. 
Park Road location is my fav even though it's getting loud and it smells a lot like bacon in the afternoons. 
Can't blame the people to stay there for hours though!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is very creative and uniquely designed.  There is a lot of room, so you don't feel confined.  I tried two macarons--mixed berry and cotton candy.  The cotton candy flavor didn't taste like cotton candy, the mix berry was very rich in flavor. I have to give them 5 stars because of the consistency of the texture beneath the crust.  It was the perfect chewy texture but had the crunch factor on the outside.  The filling was proportionate to the cookie.  I have tried a lot of macarons in various places that I have traveled within the US and outside in Europe and UK..this by far was the best macaron I have tried (in the states) that is comparable to the ones I've had in Paris. It was spot on."}
{"text":"An eclectic decor throughout.  Tables, chairs, and sofas are scattered to make this locale very laid back.  The fresh pastries are exquisite and the breakfast sandwiches are amazing.  This is a must stop on a visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and European cafe feel. My wife and I went for a late desert and chai tea & it was awesome. I would have loved to get one of the couches but they were taken. I could tell it was a Great place to just kick back and enjoy a Saturday. The Vanilla Eclair was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Good place to go for dessert with lots of options to chose from."}
{"text":"The NoDa Amelie's is the best that we have been to! It can be hard to get parking because this place is so busy. If you walk in and less than 10-15 people are in line, you're doing good! The line moves quickly and this location always has what we want. My favorite is the chocolate croissant. It works for dessert and also for breakfast the next day! The salted caramel brownie isn't my thing, but they are famous and my boyfriend says they are delicious!"}
{"text":"This location is not as great as the NoDa. I often pop in here after having dinner nearby and they may be out of chocolate croissants or some of our other favorites. If you're looking for the salted caramel brownie, they've always got that! The perk is that the space is surprisingly huge for Uptown. I've never had an issue getting a table and this location is within walking distance of lots of attractions."}
{"text":"The cafe is like the backstage prop closet for every french theater/opera production ever! Food selection is vast and the space is HUGE! I had a few hours worth of work and decided to move around to a different table ever hour just to take in as much of the ambiance as possible. 

The chicken salad sandwich ais delicious and any pastry is a good one."}
{"text":"Amélie's French Bakery was the place to be growing up in Charlotte. After a long night clubbing and eating too much cheese at the cheese and wine party, you tend to want something sweet at 4 in the morning. As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places. 

Amélie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile. 

The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves. This by no means will stop me from coming here or giving a 5 star."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on our way out of Charlotte. 

Oh Amelie, your croissants, I wish I could make them the way you do, alas it would be too much work, and I'm lazy. The croissant was just the way it should be, just the right amount of buttery and flaky, loved taking one home. I ordered a café au lait, although they call it another name, and that was made just perfectly. My quiche was fantastic, the crust was crisp and tender all at once. 

The hubs had a breakfast sandwich, at first they brought him out the wrong thing, then very quickly went back to correct it and he had his sandwich. His sandwich was served on a croissant, yum! It was huge, definitely too much of an indulgence for every day. 

This is a great breakfast stop, or drop in and get a few pastries to go from their vast selection in the pastry case."}
{"text":"I'm aware of the high ratings of this cafe and that was what brought me to try out their sandwiches and pastries. I ordered the Jambon et Fromage (Thinly sliced ham on buttered baguette, your choice of cheddar, mozzarella or asiago cheese) but I chose to replace the baguette with croissant. To be quite honest, the croissant was the only good thing about that sandwich. The ham and cheese were edible but I've tasted better at a pop up sandwich shop at the corner of an airport. Ambience however? Great! As a french bakery, obviously I had to try their macarons and other pastries. I ended up getting 2 macarons (egg nog & sugar cookie; which are their seasonal flavors), a fruit tart and a few palmier cookies. No, I wasn't expecting Ladurée standard macarons but they were way too chewy, too sweet, and was lacking in flavor. The fruit tart and palmier cookies however were fresh, crumbly and absolutely pleasant. I would recommend this cafe to everyone but you might want to do a little bit of research on what to get and what not to get here as it could be a real hit or miss."}
{"text":"Amelie's is absolutely amazing! The experience alone is the best. The pastries are delightful. They do use French buttercream which is very different from the buttercream most are used too. You can't go wrong with their macaroons, layered torte, or their tartes. They offer breakfast sandwiches and plenty of coffee choices. Stay awhile and enjoy environment!"}
{"text":"I had gotten a box of macarons and a bag of fine ground coffee (Honduras). The macarons were not as soft as Le Macaron's and lacked flavor in comparison. I had gotten the bag of coffee for my boyfriend who didn't like the taste. He even tried multiple methods of brewing it... Nespresso, French press... but it still came out sour.  Disappointed because I was visiting Charlotte and had heard great things about this bakery!"}
{"text":"Amelie's is a Charlotte staple. You can't find better pastries. The original Amelie's is my favorite. The rest don't quite measure up. 

The Petit Fours are over of my favorite things to get. They also have great macaroons and seasonal cakes. Their fruit tarts are good and let's be honest, is there anything that isn't? The salted caramel brownie is the most popular thing, but I don't like chocolate, so I can't speak for it. 

I also love coming here for a sandwich at lunch or for brunch. The seeded roast beef and Croque Monsieur are my favorite sandwiches. Their soups are also very good.  

The eclectic decor also can't be missed. The downside of this location is that there isn't a ton of seating for the number of people that come to work at a table by themselves. 

This is a must try Charlotte destination!"}
{"text":"I love Amélie's, but I was a little disappointed this visit. I love the autumn pumpkin soup and they didn't have it. They also didn't have the seasonal pumpkin macaron. We got some petit fours that were very good with the exception of the one that I was told was white chocolate pistachio that was actually dark chocolate pistachio.

On a more positive note, the Croque Monsieur and the Seeded Roast Beef sandwich were delicious as usual. The seasonal caramel apple cider and Russian tea with orange and cinnamon were absolutely fantastic. If you make it in for the fall menu, the drinks are a must try!"}
{"text":"Not sure what I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. This is the best bakery in Charlotte, period, hands down, no question. The selection is ever rotating, fresh, and never cloyingly sweet the way most bakeries here in the south are. 

I love that I can come in with my laptop (sometimes for hours), grab some tasty pastries, and a dirty chai  and just get work done no questions asked. The service is always friendly and they are accommodating to my crazily specific requests for my lattes. 

A bit pricey at times, but you get what you pay for and personally I have no problem paying a bit more for artisanal pastries/drinks and the ambiance. 

I haven't been to the Uptown location, but I will drive out of the way to go to the NoDa location over the Carmel Rd. location, it just has a different feel and slightly different clientele."}
{"text":"Great desserts.. love the atmosphere! Bet ya didn't know everything in this amazing french bakery was recycled or found at goodwill? It's awesome eclectic mix makes for a living room like environment. Love that it's 24 hours too."}
{"text":"A Charlotte must! I went to the uptown location for the first time and I was so impressed by the size of it! I was impressed with the quality as well. I ordered one of their specialty lattes with salted caramel sauce and vanilla bean syrup and it was just perfect. Also had the turkey, Brie, and fruit compote sandwich, which was also great. I had a cup of vegan Thai soup, which was a nice compliment to my sandwich. It was a lovely place to spend an afternoon working. I want to go late night for the dessert case!"}
{"text":"I love the selection they have, definitely the best French macarons around but the issue is for some reason they have stopped carrying a lot of flavors. It's disappointing."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe in the heart of Charlotte! It is a really large space with an equally large menu! They have everything from french pastries to chose from the case to hot breakfast made to order. They also have a large selection of drinks. Basically a perfect all day breakfast place!
We went crazy with our breakfast order- we ordered a macaron, danish, 2 half hot sandwiches (which were much larger than expected) and ofcourse a cappuccino and hot chocolate.
The food was delicious and the service was nice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this spot... the decor and ambiance was amazing. 
I live for a cafe a whole feel. I am lost in the alice in wonderland mad tea party vibe. 

The food: I enjoyed it. Nothing to truly write home about.... I imagine its more about the chill and meet up than actually enjoying to food experience. 

The staff: perfectly appointed awkward folks which make you feel at home....

downfall... it was a creepy guy in there and he stared at me and my wife for awhile... made us feel crazy uncomfortable. But thats not Amelia responsibility."}
{"text":"OMG !!! Amelie's .... I dont think it can get any better. Fresh baked french goods with fancy whimsical ambiance !!! seriously I think the owners designed these locations with mad hatter lovers in mind. 

I truly try not to go to Amelie's everyday... because you dont need a reason to go here, you want with every fiber of your body to have one of there delicious desserts, pastries or coffee drinks. 

Amelie's Uptown is just awesome!!!! more to come"}
{"text":"Amelie's is so amazing.  I never get sad when I go there.  I love the convenience of it being open 24/7.  All of the staff is just great, even during the middle of the night.  My favorite thing there is the Roast Beef Croissant, I can never get enough of it!  It's one of those things that I ALWAYS get.  I also love the atmosphere in there, it's just so chill.  I think it would be crazy if there was someone out there that did not like this French Bakery."}
{"text":"Wow! From picture frames, to ceiling high french props, amazing scenery... Not to mention the atmosphere. Definitely a must come to when craving some treats! No matter the time or occasion. 

The prices may be a tad high, but just the experience is worth it. Not to mention the best caramel salted brownie treats! Love Amelie's, def coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the salted caramel brownies.  I always take friends that are visiting from out of town to Amelies."}
{"text":"The food is definitely decent, if gimmicky. It's gone downhill from where it used to be, certainly. And they used to be really good about being aware of what allergens were in which items, but not anymore-- I got an item with surprise coconut on my most recent visit (luckily my allergy isn't life threatening). You REALLY don't want to go on a weekend night, because the lines are insane. If it were still what it once was, it would be worth the hype, but those days are gone."}
{"text":"Forget this place if you are disabled, because the way it is set up, those of us who can't get around well are obviously just an afterthought. While the main entrance has awnings and decorations, the one that has a ramp instead of stairs is hidden out of view on the other side of the building with a much smaller sign that only indicates that Amelie's is in that space, not that there is an entrance there. There is a total of one accessible parking space in that section of the lot, and it is all the way over by Rocksalt. Brownies or no brownies, I'm going to keep looking for a place where I'm a customer and not just a grudging legal requirement."}
{"text":"On my last trip to Charlotte a couple of nice ladies sharing our picnic table mentioned Amélie's as a must visit place for breakfast or sweets. After perusing some of the reviews I quickly bookmarked it and the morning of our flight out we stopped by for breakfast and dessert.

The shop is absolutely adorable. All of the tables, chairs chandeliers, and decorations are unique and fit together like a quaint, French-inspired, antique dining room. You have plenty of time while in line to pick out what you'd like and after ordering at the counter (and probably impulse buying many pastries) you grab a seat and put a number up to identify your order. 

Breakfast came out quickly and all four of us had different breakfast sandwiches. The croissant was great, exactly what I'd expect of a French bakery. The sandwich overall was, ya know, a breakfast sandwich (bacon-egg-cheese) - nothing terribly special but still good and eating it with my cappuccino and the lovely restaurant made it a great experience. I wish I could have stayed all morning with a book and a mug people watching and noticing all of the nuances of the shop that are overlooked at first glance, but alas we had a flight to catch.

Before departing Justin and I naturally couldn't resist getting back in line for some treats - the only hard part was picking out only a handful to try. Everything hit the spot and this is definitely somewhere I'd like to come back to. What a great recommendation from the friendly ladies we'd met earlier in the week."}
{"text":"maybe the pastries are good but the service is shit, the coffee sucks and the service is shit. and its in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Deserts delight! I have always gone for the deserts there. 
Most loved was the Napoleon. Cream filled sandwich type desert with a crusty layer on top  (If you are not watching your weight)"}
{"text":"Always love it here! great service. cool place to sit. and just enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty much legendary around Charlotte. When you taste their desserts, you'll know why!"}
{"text":"Great for events, brunches, bridal showers, business meetings, general work, quick snacks... oh, and coffee. 

The Uptown Amelie's trades the cramped (but cool) feeling of the original and expands it to a lighter shade of eclectic - less like it's the set of hoarders, and tons of natural light. There's a main level and then splits so you can explore all around. I love the pastries and tarts, but there's also more substantial items like sandwiches and such. As long as I can bike here easily, I'll keep on coming :)"}
{"text":"Decor is eclectic and very interesting.  It has a hippie, trendy, college studying vibe going on.  It reminded me a little bit like this place called the Spider House Cafe in Austin, TX, but this one is more cafe/bakery centered. The layout is very unique with a variety of little rooms and hallways, an indoor atrium connects the businesses and there is a hookah lounge and small arcade across the atrium/hallway. Again very interesting lay-out and diverse crowd too, which makes it even cooler.  

Went last night with one of my friends who has been there a couple times before.  She ordered one of the 4\" pecan pies and a french soda.  She's had the pecan pie before and loves them, and she let me try a bite.. it was delicious!  She was not a fan of the french soda though.  I ordered an open faced spinach & asiago on french bread, it was good, but I thought it would be more of a sandwich, so I would not order that again.  I also ordered a bowl of the pumpkin bisque, which was MAGICAL!  I would definitely order that again.  We also got a dessert to go and halved it between us, a vanilla strawberry petit gateau, which was very creamy and yummy!  

Prices are definitely expensive, but it is an overall good experience.  Good ambience. Staff is friendly.  Decor is eclectic.  Food is tasty.  Fun, relaxing and quiet atmosphere.  Open 24 hours!  Diverse crowd.  Free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and love their 'chocolate petit gateau'. This is the perfect chocolate cake for me. Absolutely 5 stars for this cake! Very rich and not too sweet. Creamy chocolate covered outside and very moist bread and cream balanced inside. My favorite menu here. Tried their lemon tea cake, financier. Very moist and rich. It is much richer than other financier I tried. Some might prefer and some might not. I have been satisfied their cake and service in this location so far. Definitely will try other menus next time!"}
{"text":"Great selection of desserts and a big seating area. Great spot to catch up with a friend or to do some work or studying. I really enjoy the chocolate hazelnut petite fours. The last visit the employees were all very friendly and the desserts looked great!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is splendid, it's aroma is so captivating. My son ordered the black coffee, which was surprisingly good considering that I don't like my coffee strong. This is a great place to hang out with my kids and my girlfriends. The location here is amazing because as soon as you finish your coffee, you get to stroll through downtown and explore. The thing that I love most about this place is their chandeliers, hands down breath taking."}
{"text":"Let me note, the ONLY reason I'm not giving Amelie's five stars is there always been a crazy long wait each time I've gone. That is a good sign, but I wish they would address this and find a way to get customers thru the line quicker. 

That said, the caramel salted brownies are AMAZING!!! I could drive down from Winston-Salem just for those! I have tried other items there as well, the most recent being a raspberry peach torte. Delicious! The coffee options are divine as well.

The facility is rambling, with quite the eclectic decor and it is one of the 'places' to be seen in NODA. It is open 24/7 and has quite a following now. I would suggest this place to anyone who is in Charlotte and wants a quick baked goods/coffee fix! Just remember about the wait..."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how AMAZING this place is!!!!! As soon as you walk in the Decor Smacks you in the face and you IMMEDIATELY LOVE everything and  want to live in this bakery somehow somewhere!!!! The Sampling of tarts muffins and brownies I bought have each been MIND BLOWING delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at the downtown location.  The tables were all dirty and we couldn't find a good spot to eat, even though there are MANY tables to choose from.  Maybe they were having a bad day?  but it wasn't that crowded when we went and I'm not sure I want to give them a second try :-("}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the ham and cheese croissant.. the chocolate mousse with a chocolate covered strawberry on top. ummmm ummmm good.."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely when you walk in, but the macaroons and cafe mocha was lacking. I had heard the hype of coming here and was slightly disappointed after leaving. If I didn't know the macaroons had a filing, I wouldn't have been able to guess from the outer appearance. They had an extremely thin layer of overwhelming mixed berry jam. The chocolate cinnamon one was pleasant. The cafe mocha was very bitter. The mix of espresso with bitter dark chocolate made the overall taste of the drink very bitter."}
{"text":"A piece of paris in Noda. Yummy pastries good drinks and art everywhere. Great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"For the occasional sweet cravings - this is the place- expensive but, definitely worth to go there. The varieties what you get and what you can try is simply amazing. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well to some up the latest location the phrase \"soccer mom\" comes to mind.  All of the eclectic charm of the NODA Amelie's is gone and replaced with a franchised version.  The staff is ok, more of an order taker than of a locally owned shop.  The desserts are amazing as always so at least that hasn't changed.  The Key Lime tart is our new favorite!  I've been twice and will continue to go as I love their food, but the atmosphere of the NODA location cannot be duplicated and maybe they shouldn't have tried as it's a miss."}
{"text":"What could be more perfect on Friday for lunch than Amelie's?  Nothing!  Everything was perfect, from the croque monsieur to the salted caramel tart...yum!  It is so hard to narrow down what I want to eat when I go there; everything is amazing. The quirkiness of the decor just adds to the overall experience.  I love Amelie's and will continue to come back often."}
{"text":"My favorite part about this place is the smell when you walk in. It just makes me so happy. The lines are often around the counter and beyond, but they move quickly. I love that they are open 24/7 ... I went on Christmas Day to get some French bread and desserts for Christmas dinner. I love the chamomile tea with lavender. The croquet monsieur was a disappointment after having lived off of it for a week in Paris, but everything else is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Just don't think it lives up to the hype.  Yes, it is a funky eclectic place but the food is not exceptional and the same things can be found in other places at a much better level of quality.  Enjoy standing in line for an hour for croissant!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte a few weeks ago and wanted something different. great place. very helpful staff. good food. My wife and I stopped back in yesterday."}
{"text":"Yes I will give Amelie's five stars for their fresh delivery of their pastries. Salted caramel brownie is number one. However the sandwiches are pricey for 1 to 2 ounces of meat. Also I remember previously hearing about the employees being mistreated and not paid overtime and I do not like supporting businesses that mistreat employees."}
{"text":"A great spot to dine, laugh and meet friends!! Also perfect for a quiet read on a sofa with a great book and coffee!!"}
{"text":"Wow, now its not the Amalie's of Charlotte here in Pineville but the fare is just as good. Love the soups as they are homemade. This Amalie's has a coffee, wine, beer bar. They are just the best i you are looking for a dessert of quality. Just the best."}
{"text":"Have I died and gone to heaven? Well if I have I must have been a very good girl. Everything thing I have tried has been so yummy. Even the soup is good. I have had the sandwiches and the Macaroons, you must try them. I love the little cakes and the yellow and blue tea. Just the best.  We make it a stop for everyone we take or pick up from the airport . A must visit on the Charlotte food tour as we call it
Just make sure you can wait as some of the lines can get long , especially on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Just the best bakery on this sifted of the Mississippi . Yes the lines are long but sometimes the wait is worth the wait. Does that make sense. Everything so far I have tied is out of this world...and they dont stop at desserts, try their soup or sandwiches. I have only had one rude staff person since coming here and well he will not last long . We always bring people there from the airport to make the trip worth making . What to try, its all good, just order away...and dont leave if there is a line. I see so many leave and thing..bad move"}
{"text":"So, so busy at all hours... It's hard to relax and enjoy the atmosphere with all the people crowding around.  Good food and decent coffee, though."}
{"text":"Nice place to chill, good bakery. Enjoyed my time there."}
{"text":"Chocolate crossant is ok, mix berry tart is cold and too sweet. Limited choices, ok envirinment. Syrange way to pay bills, that cashier have to open each box to see what is inside and then put in the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic pastries and other miscellaneous desserts.  Sometimes has a long wait, but it's worth it.  Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good. We waited in line for 30 minutes bracing for the celebrated Amelie's cafe. When it was my turn to order the cashier abruptly told us that they were out of food but we were welcomed to order the few pastries that were left. The service was horrid and the pastries stale. The coffee was good, which is why I give it two stars. Would not recommend you go there."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to go to in Charlotte! The best desserts I've had since visiting Paris and really brings me back to authentic french food at a extremely affordable price. Some of my favorites include the salted caramel brownie, fruit tart, and twice baked croissant. Pretty much everything there is good, you can't go wrong with trying something new each time! 

Also, the food food is also quite delish! I always have their soups because they are immaculate.The chicken salad croissant is my favorite sandwich there, but the others I've tried are great as well!

Not only is the food good, the atmosphere is what gives Amelie's the whole package. Their eccentric and random decor really creates that vintage and artsy feel. The people I see each time I'm there ranges from hipsters to families to businessmen. One of the best perks of the place is that it's open 24/7! No matter what time of the day you are craving a good dessert or sandwich, you can count on Amelie's to be open!"}
{"text":"Loved the look of this bakery it's is delightfully  different and refreshing. The dessert spread is brilliant and the chocolate mousse was out of the world . It is always packed and always open :) I am glad that we found this treasure during our trip to charlotte and even more glad now that I know that they have branch here in Atlanta. This is going to become one of our go to dessert places."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go here so long and finally had the chance to go today.  So disappointing.  I don't know what everyone is raving about.  The decor is very cute, which I'd probably give a 4, but it all seemed dusty and unclean,  which I'll get back to in a moment.  We had the ham and gruyere, which was ok but was missing something like a spread or mustard.  We also had the bacon and brie, which was good, but needed more brie.  I got a latte... frankly I've had better coffee at Starbucks. I expect more from a real coffeehouse.  The flavor was flat plus it was only luke warm.  We also got a Napoleon,  eclair, and 3 macaroons.  The macaroons were decent, although quite large. I prefer smaller. But the flavor was good.  The eclair was fine, but nothing exciting and didn't seem super fresh.  I'm quite a good baker and can do better.  The Napoleon was not good.  I cannot stand when a Napoleon has anything other than pastry cream.  They use a combination of pastry cream and whipped cream for the filling, which is better than the places that just do whipped cream, but it is not a proper Napoleon.  I'm not a super -sweet dessert person anyways, but this filling lacked sugar.  The icing was a good flavor, but it was liquid instead of a thickened hard shell.  For food and atmosphere I'd have given a 3, but the real kicker is I see a barrista use the restroom and not wash her hands. Gross.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't as impressed with the popular \"salted caramel brownie\" as I had hoped. Seems to be a lot of the hype of this place and it was a bit too rich/sweet and more like a fudge than a brownie.

That being said the atmosphere is great - a huge plus to me - and the staff was fairy friendly. It was pretty packed on a Tuesday night, could barley find a table. So it must be pretty great. All the good looked really good so I'll probably come back to try the food.

Seemed like the perfect place to work for a while or post up with a coffee to relax."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST try if you're visiting Charlotte. There are multiple locations but this one is located close to the Epicentre. Everything I have ever gotten here is delicious, from their coffees to their seasonal drinks and teas, to their sandwiches and pastries. Try their Monte Cristo and if you can't/don't eat ham like me, sub it out for roast turkey and its still delicious. I love their pear tart and their chocolate raspberry tart, but you can't go wrong with any of their pastries. Lines are long but move quickly. Servers are hit or miss in terms of friendliness and helpfulness. And the decor is so cute!"}
{"text":"The lobby looks like the entry way into heaven! I'm not big on Sweets, but the atmosphere is amazing. I loose all sense of time in this place. I'm addicted to the soups and the salted caramel brownie is one thing that satisfies my overly picky sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I like this Amélie's in general but it's not that great compared to the NoDa location, to me... it could honestly be the college nostalgia. 

 If you know this area, you know it can be a bitch to leave and enter this location but the parking is plentiful. 

Staff is a little off putting at this location and the separate areas for pick ups are down right confusing. 

The coffee is great quality, as well as the food. It just sucks that the staff pretty much ruined the experience."}
{"text":"I'm an Amelies regular so I pretty much know most of the staff but Coltrane went over and beyond this morning. I wasn't 100% happy with my lavender lemonade so I asked for more simple syrup and he gave me more but then he simply asked if he could make me another. I hesitated because I didn't want to put more work on him and I felt I could tweak the one I already had. He whipped up another one in no time and it was a perfect pair for my breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this cute little artsy place. Although the ordering process is not that simple to follow the food is worth everything you can give it. The ambiance just adds to what the food already proves: that this place is great! Plenty of pastries and you feel like you're really in a bistro in France. Service is awesome as well! We asked for bottled water but the cashier said that they had cold tap water available for self service if we wanted that instead of purchasing a bottle. That was nice of him."}
{"text":"Wonderful Place, love the atmosphere!! And the chocolate brownie coffee, OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - 24/7 love the food/Dessert"}
{"text":"Ok, I stumbled upon this place at 4 am on a thursday night and the aroma of something warm and fresh filled with yumminess was about to come out of the over. 

The salted carmel brownie are HOLY F&$K MY MOUTH Delicious but if you can fancy yourself a croissant, then you my friend are in heaven!!


The place is filled with charming, yet delightful and comfortable places to sit and the bakery is oddly large for that. 


The aroma is seemingly constant and I could not find myself in a happier place at 4 am and filled with alcoholic beverages. 

I think I even managed to order $45 worth of pastries just to bring into my ESPN crew the next day to indulge."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was super skeptical to try macarons so I was trying to find a place in Charlotte that would have macarons that compared to the ones at La Panier in Seattle, WA. We ended up here after a little bit of browsing and it didn't disappoint!! 

The macarons were so good and definitely worth the drive. They weren't too chewy and they weren't too crunchy. They literally just melted in my mouth. 

I definitely will be back again to try more flavor and cannot wait to try the other food here too. I love macarons so much and will be moving to the Charlotte Area this fall. 

Amélie's will definitely be one of my regular go-to's."}
{"text":"Amelie's is an amazing spot for coffee, pastries and a quick bite.
Like the other locations, this newest location has a unique decor with tables, booths and couches to allow customers to feel comfortable during their visit.

I recently tried a lunch sandwich, the Turkey and Bacon. OMG, so good. It is served on a buttery croissant with herbs de Provence mayonnaise and cheese. It sure hit the spot. 
With that said, the real highlight to my recent visit was the salted caramel bar, heaven. I don't think I have ever gone to Amelie's without getting one.

Another great addition to the Park Road Shopping Center!"}
{"text":"After a long day, and a healthy fish and veggie dinner, I deserved a treat. We drove over to Amelie's, and words cannot express the fact that I will be back. What a quaint, unique, funky atmosphere. However, that was nothing! The coffee and desserts were amazing!! My favorite, the Carmel chocolate brownie, that salty sweet treat everyone craves! The macaroons  were delist! I will be back to enjoy this unique place and their amazing treats!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars, no doubt.

This location is right outside my office and I love their menu, service and overall vibe of the entire place.
On my most recent visit I ordered lunch to go. I ordered the Turkey & Bacon, my favorite...Turkey, Bacon, Cheese with an amazing garlic herb mayo on a Croissant Roll, heaven.
Due to the fact there is a line for pastries and food items they definitely direct you accordingly, in addition, for take out or pick up orders they have a designated area for that.
Service is always on point and the food is quality.

For those with a sweet tooth please try the salted caramel bar, heaven!"}
{"text":"Tres bien! The napoleon is scrumptious! Their breakfasts are good too :) Cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"The croissant sandwiches are AWESOME! Turkey & bacon croissants are delicious. 

Iced tea: WHY do you have to inconvenience your customer & to have to go to the bar for a refill of tea when you could have tea at a drink station for easy refill? The bar gets backed up & having to stand & wait for a tea refill is nuts! 

Seating: They Need more seating & comfy chairs that are NOT hard flat bottomed chairs or garden chairs. 

To have such a cute French bakery, this location needs to ADD a few more partitions/French screens/shutters/walls to separate the seating on the entrance side & the center of the restaurant. 
The glare from the sun can be harsh at noon. So putting up partitions or putting up blinds would really help with this problem."}
{"text":"Consistent in its funkiness with the other locations. All of the cool decor and seating once has come to expect along with good air conditioning. Pastries and coffee and tea. A good stopping point in the wonderful Park Road Shopping Center."}
{"text":"This place is an institution in Charlotte. The brilliant move was when they decided to go 24/7. I thought it was crazy at the time. Instead, it really simply became a safe late night haven regardless of why you were out late. I like the diversity of the crowd and the sense that I am among intelligent, sensitive and discerning people who are engaged with that element of diversity. The pastries are excellent though a bit pricey and the coffee is always good. So, the only reason for four stars instead of five is the price. I swear I think I saw their pastries on the train ride in the Hunger Games."}
{"text":"Love love love Amelie's! I usually go to Amelie's for coffee but decided to try it for dinner as well. The vegetable Gouda soup was great and so were the salads! Not to mention, the salads were huge! They also have great service and a big selection of wine. I highly recommend Amelie's for anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot and they are 24 hours. The macaroons are delish, I usually get the egg, cheddar, and tomato on a croissant. I've tried so many things and never been disappointed. The fruit tart is my fav!!"}
{"text":"The cutest bakery I've been to! The breakfast sandwiches and coffee drinks are delicious and fun to enjoy in this quiet, intimate, unique setting! It's the perfect place to get some work done or to grab a coffee with a friend. When you go, try not to buy everything in the baked good case!!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop into Amelie's once lunchtime rolled around.  It was a simple enough decision:  \"Hey, we're here, and this place sounds nice.\"  We just had no idea what a perfect café experience it would be.  

Their pastry options were top-notch, and their lunch options, while somewhat limited, were fantastic.  I enjoyed a crocque monsieur sandwich with a cup of carrot ginger wild rice soup.  Both were delicious, but I was particularly impressed by how crammed full of its named contents the soup was.  There was even a surprise sprinkle of pecan pieces on top.  Each spoonful was positively heaping with items from the first spoonful to the last.  

We ordered an assortment of mini deserts after lunch.  Their pecan tart was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten, and their pumpkin mousse tart was perfect on every level (texture, temperature, flavor balance, spice).

The café was very large, exceptionally clean, and full of various antique seating options.  There are toile curtains and lamp shades, and chandeliers everywhere.  There is an entire wall of needlepoint replicas of famous works of art.  The walls are a lovely powder blue, providing a wonderful backdrop to the bright, airy café.  Décor is whimsical and fun.  It is unmistakably French, but with a sense of humor.

Shockingly, this café is open 24/7/365.  There is free wi-fi for all you laptop addicts, though I highly recommend coming here with someone you can stand to have a conversation with and chatting for a while.  Honor the French café spirit!"}
{"text":"We're fans. We enjoyed a variety of pastries; fairly traditional to a French pastries, but slightly sweeter. 

We had the chocolate and cream cheese croissant, Crème brûlée, yogurt w/ fruit & granola, a mini lemon meringue pie w/ a raspberry, and two cream puffs! This was my treat to my daughter, so we ate a sample of everything and the rest will go home with us to be enjoyed later.

Tip: If you are not concerned for the time of day you go, plan to go before 6PM. We went on a Saturday at 10PM and there was a line wrapped through the entire place and out the back door. We left. We went back on Sunday morning at 9AM and no line at all. A local told us every night starts to build up starting around 6, so if you go at night, just bring some friends and expect to hang out."}
{"text":"This is the strongest 5 stars I can possibly give.  I come here occasionally with my wife and four year old son to relax and enjoy some much needed time with the family. Their service is amazing. Such a chill, friendly, and positive environment. Tonight  the cashier sparked conversation since there wasn't anyone waiting in line and in the middle of conversation i noticed I had left my wallet home. Embarrassed, I apologized and asked to suspend my order...he picked up my tab with a smile and my family and I enjoyed our night. So thankful for this place."}
{"text":"This bakery is endless with amazing food the turkey and brie sandwich is my personal favorite and my go to macaroon will always be raspberry. Although sometimes the service isn't always as amazing as the food. Most of the time I have a good time there and it's a strong French atmosphere."}
{"text":"Aside from the nice setting and atmosphere and their locations, this place always has a nice vibe. I'm not a fan of \"Americanized\" french dessert, it's no where close to desserts in europe. I noticed that very commonly in the US, desserts tend to be way overly sweet. Their sandwiches on the other hand are actually very good, so is their bread. Customer service also is an issue to address, most of the staff is friendly and inviting, however a few are just utterly rude and think they are serving prisoners:S I don't get why though, cost nothing to smile for people. Overall it's a nice place and hangout zone."}
{"text":"French inspired bakery filled with Charlotte hipsters and thrift store decor.  I enjoyed the spunky atmosphere but was highly disappointed by my dull + dry pistachio buttercream frosted, silky ganache filled, double chocolate cake...I guess that's what I get for indulging!"}
{"text":"Amelie's French Bakery is simply amazing, how have I not heard of this place before!?"}
{"text":"This is indeed a charming spot, even though I felt the decor was trying to hard to be what came off as artificially French. It was cluttered, but in an inviting and quirky way. 

You order at the counter, are given a number to take to your table, and your food appears impressively fast! 

The food was good. I got Turkey and Brie with a seasonal compote on a white baguette. I got the entire sandwich and a cup of beef and barely soup for just $7.59. The portion was such that I wouldn't have been full with the half sandwich and side ($6.59). The sandwich was warm and contained only the exact ingredients listed on the menu.

There was free water. Also there is a substantial dessert counter that looked amazing. 

Good quick service lunch spot / bakery / cafe. Grab a table and stay awhile."}
{"text":"The salted caramel brownie was very yummy. I really like the crunchy texture. Wish I had gotten more than one since I'm not from there. Will definitely come back for more if I get to visit Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"Obviously this is a popular place (100+ reviews in CLT is quite an achievement) and from the way the reviews are showing, people just cannot get enough of Amelie's.  I have to agree... this is an unique place for Charlotte, well fitted in the NoDa area with its quirky parisian decor.  And it is open 24 hours, a fabulously chic alternative to the good ole around the clock dining options (which are mainly diners & \"Awful House\").  I mean, just because it's 2:30am and a girl is looking a little rough after a night out doesn't mean she is condemned to scattered, covered and chunked only.

I would have normally given it a 4-star, since I am a fan of the place and have enjoyed plenty of the mushroom & leek tartines... but I am feeling a little honest today.  Plus, being on a bandwagon has never been my style.

To be fair, I don't a sweet tooth.  The only dessert I had here was a creme brulee.  It was peanut butter flavor... probably my first mistake of trying an unconventional take of the classic.  It was NOT to die for; in fact the center was very cold and not creamy and we did not even finish it (we, as in 2 people, and normally I would chow down a creme brulee faster than you can say \"fatty\").  So... thumbs down from me... better leave dessert reviews to others.

But what really got to me was last night when I went there to study for my exam.  Knowing I would pull a late one, I figured I would order food when it got less crowded.  But before my seat was even warm, I was approached by an older man (owner?) because apparently I have committed the deadliest Amelie's crime of having a coffee cup from another place with me.  Sorry... I just didn't want to waste my perfectly made English Breakfast Tea with cream & sugar.  But instead of being friendly about it, he was blunt and rude. \"This is NOT my coffee cup\" is not going to make me feel warm & fuzzy about getting your coffee.  All I am saying is... a place like this supposes to make people want to stay & linger (and spend $ in the long run).  I know we are all here to make a buck, and I sure was going to (and did) spend my bucks there... it's ok to be nice about my existing (apparenlty illegitimate) drink.  A quick joke of \"I hope you're getting something to go with that drink?\" or even a nice \"sorry no outside cups are allowed\" would have conveyed the same message.

At the end, as much as this place is unique and hip and cool alternative for late night dining, I personally think the food has always been \"ok\" and slightly overpriced for what it is (this is after all NOT a restaurant).  Will I be back?  Likely yes.  But let's hope next time I won't get prosecuted for something else I am not aware of."}
{"text":"It's difficult to fully express my love for this place. When I lived in Charlotte I went here far too often. Now I always visit when I come to town. The NoDa location is preferable to Uptown but either spot has their delicious signature treats. The Napoleon is the best I've had!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We visited on a Sunday around 5pm so the line wasn't too long. It's one of the best bakeries I've ever seen. I love the antiques and quirky things I find. 

Variety of desserts and yummy cafe (sandwiches and salads) bites! Great workplace, getaway, hang-out, creative space, girls meet-up, book club gathering, intimate date, and the list goes on! 

We tried a little bit of everything for our dessert and will be back to relax."}
{"text":"I really liked all the chocolate things I've tried. The brownie was delish and the little chocolate hazelnut thing. The other pastrys were pretty good as well. Great cup of coffee too!"}
{"text":"Pastries? Amazing.  Coffee? Stellar.  Chicken salad croissant? Delicious.  Turkey & Brie? Yummy. Service? Must be keeping it Paris authentic, because rude is the word that first comes to mind.  From the pastry box filler to the cashier.  This place gave me anxiety and had my wife not had her heart set on this place (and already filled a box with pastries), I  would have walked out.  Menus people could look at while they are in line would make this process move much quicker, and staff understanding that you can't see the menu until right before you order would make it much more of a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"If you are downtown near the city center/convention center and want coffee and a pastry come here!  The coffee was great and the pastry counter looked to die for.  The decorations are themed, and place is all in all a cool spot.  We had the quiche of the day.  It was ham and cheddar.  I had two pieces of ham in my piece, and my wife only had one.  This made for a large slice of  egg pie, which is not what I ordered.  French Press YUM.  Wife's specialty drink was good too."}
{"text":"As an avid coffee drinker and lover, I am always on the look for the best coffee around. I recently moved to the area and have heard nothing but good things about Amelie's French Bakery and Cafe. I knew I had to try it! I went to a Yelp event here, hosted by Amelie's and Pure Intentions Coffee, the coffee that they serve. I learned so much about how Pure Intentions roasts their coffee and how it gets from the harvest to your cup at Amelie's. Matt Yarmey, the company's owner and founder, shared with us his story and all about the fair trade coffee that he is so passionate about. We also got to hear from Mora, a manager at Amelie's, who shared with us a little bit about the company and led us in a delicious coffee tasting. Definitely one of the coolest events I have gone to! A huge thank you to Nikki, who organized the event and has put in so much work to all of the Charlotte Made events! This one was definitely one of my faves!"}
{"text":"I don't get the people who think this is the best bakery in the world.  I have tried something here a half-dozen times, and each time, the only thing I ever thought was OK was the coffee.  The last 2 times I didn't even bother going in.  Instead, my wife and her friend waited in line for an eternity to get small boxes of treats to eat on the way home from the breweries.  Although I am always pleased to create a reminder in my google calendar when I can remind my wife of a time I was right - it will also remind of a time when my wife spent my money on overpriced pastries that are dry, and more or less bland.  Both times my wife agreed that it was not very good, when her friend asked \"why is it so busy then?!?\" my wife responded \"sheeple.\"  

Luckily Abari and Free Range brewing are close enough to where the wife was able to drop me and her friends husband off to drink and play TMNT: the arcade game!"}
{"text":"very lack luster,  whats the big deal ??     The \"buttercream frosting\"  and I use that term LOOSELY !   is more like crisco cream frosting,    and lets forget about the salted carmel brownies,   they are NOT what they use to be :(   sorry Amelies,    I wont go back ,,   I will stick with  Novas Bakeries in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Hmmm where do I start!!! Desserts are freakin awesome!!!!! Give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful words for how much I love Amelia's. The staff is so very sweet as is the treats. I highly recommended taking people there for any meal or snack. We ordered my son's birthday cake for his 14th and everyone raved over the decadence. We even froze the leftover and ate on it for a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Every time I drive through Charlotte, I stop at the NoDa location. The food and atmosphere are awesome. I just sit back for a couple hours and read my book. Eat a sandwich and pastries. Love the salted caramel coffee."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this cafe is open 24hr 7days a week!!!! There have been plenty of sleepless nights when my friends and I would get out the house to congregate at Amelie's. Free wifi and good sweets, my fave is the chocolate mousse cup with the strawberry."}
{"text":"Plus a few stars for adorable atmosphere, minus a few stars for the food. 
The caramel brownie is diabetes in bar form, more like fudge covered in caramel than a true brownie. The chocolate croissant was awful. Gritty chocolate paste center with a bready consistency croissant rather than buttery flakes. Pecan sticky bun was hard as a rock. Macaroon was tough and chewy like a hard marshmallow. 
Awesome coffee though!"}
{"text":"Arrived at this to quite a long line but it moved rather quickly. We ordered a few petite fours from the case before we orders the entrees. We had the Croque Mansor w  baguettes w cheese spreads and jams. A bit weird you take a number and somehow the waiter finds you and brings you the food in a  large place. Waited about 30 mins easy on Sunday afternoon, if I woulda got my food quicker maybe 5 stars. Like French cuisine don't care for frilly French decor, I thinks it looks ridiculous."}
{"text":"Well to start out this magically bakery is opened 24/7 to serve all of the hungry people of Noda and most of Charlottes early risers. We arrived here after picking my mom from the airport about a 20 min drive depending on traffic and stop lights. Once we got inside we ordered the famous Carmel brownies,macaroons, almond tea cakes, and several other beautifully crafted petite fours to eat and take with us on the journey back home today. As for the food I ordered the delightful croque massieur forgive me if I spelled that wrong but it's basically a croissant w ham and cheese that's my way of explaining the simplified version of the dish. Very very good make sure you try it as soon as possible. But getting back to the bakery, after ordering are dishes we sat in the back at a large table just enjoying the decor anticipating a great breakfast. We all loved what we had to eat and can't wait to return !"}
{"text":"Great large space with plenty of seating without feeling cramped. I came in on a weekday morning and there was a line but it moved quickly. I tried the twice baked almond croissant, macaron, and a chai latte. I loved the spices in the chai, but it was a bit sweet for my taste. I had asked the cashier and she said it wasn't sweetened, but it definitely was! The croissant was big, but it wasn't flakey enough - definitely not the best croissant. Macaron was good though. I may not have tried the right things, but for now, leaving a three for the disappointing croissant."}
{"text":"We really like this new location as long as you are already in uptown that is! Of course like everything else in uptown parking is an issue so it is really only an option if you are already down there. This place is huge and would be great for a get together with people. I love it's very open floor plan and nice outside seating area. The food is just as wonderful as its other locations and even thought they are known for the salted Carmel brownie I love the salted Carmel torte way better! Also that Pecan sticky bun is amazing:)"}
{"text":"Coffee and a chocolate croissant? Yes, please. A small box of macarons to take home to my wife? Yes, please!

I popped into Amelie's and had a very good experience. Coffee in an actual ceramic cup. On a saucer, no less! And it was good coffee. I sat with the coffee and munched my pastry while eating up a good bit of their very speedy wifi.

This seems to be a very popular spot for having business meetings and catch ups. Lots of people sitting, looking at binders and laptops, drinking coffee and talking, talking, talking.

Very comfy spot."}
{"text":"I chilled at Amélie's for almost an hour enjoying a latte and some macarons and some internet. It's a super busy place but they keep it nicely organized with signs pointing folks to the end of the queue and where to drop off dirty dishes. I like that they have the transponder doo-dads so that the folks bringing food to the table don't have to hunt around. Clever stuff.

Nice restaurant with tables inside and out.

Bathroom could use a bit of help though. It was clean, just a little beat up."}
{"text":"Amelie's has such a mind-numblingly large selection that I had no idea what to get when looking at their pastry case.  I eventually got a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, and was later shocked at how much I just spent. :)

The only problems?  It's way the heck up in NoDa, and the Jamon sandwich was toasted and had Dijon mustard on it.  Blasphemy!"}
{"text":"This place, is my little piece of heaven on earth. I am always looking for an excuse to go. I LOVE their macaroons. The salted Carmel is my very favorite. These macaroons are almost identical to the ones in Paris. 

I also love their lavender lemonade and other drink concoction. They have an amazing selection of other wonderful pastries. Also their soups and sandwiches are very good too."}
{"text":"This place is great for late late night sweet treats. We love going here. The decor is so eclectic it makes you feel like you are somewhere else. The treats are great as well as the coffee. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I brought my friend here because I was bragging how good the place was I use to like the location 3 years ago but  the service have went downhill. This place use to be more professional when I lived here 3 years ago. Now since they have grown bigger they don't care about their customers anymore they give us a savory bread with pork on them (bacon. My friend went to the cashier and ask did this bread have  pork and was told no.They lie and said it was not pork but it was we both are Muslim and very disappointed .after eating the entire bread  sandwich"}
{"text":"They should call their salted caramel brownie CRACK!

Overheard while I was in line-
Server 1 hands server 2 a box
Server 2: gracias!
Server 1: you should probably say thank you in French since we work in a French bakery.
Server 2: oh, how do you say thank you in french?
Server 1: hmmmmmmm. Merci I think.

Nothing about Amelie's is French BUT their petite fours & salted caramel brownies are aaamazinggggg!!!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and thought I would visit more often than I do.  The hype was great.  And I've never visited the other location so I was dying to try this.  I'm not big on their macaroons.  A bit too fluffy for me.  It's more cake like than I like my macaroons.  The cakes are pretty good.  The eclairs are delicious though.  Same with the salted caramel brownies.  And they have meringues that they do in different flavors sometimes.  Those are a deal and super yummy.  

The restaurant itself is so relaxing and inviting that I could find it hard to leave when I'm relaxing with some friends or my sisters and family there.  There is always a line.  But it does move along pretty quick.  Their coffee can use some work.  Mine was pretty weak and I asked for the strongest blend they had."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Late night pastries mmm... my fiance has 3 salted caramel brownies. He loves them. Do not pass up a breakfast sandwich on croissant. Their croissants are divine! Coconut macarons were delicious. This a must when in the QC."}
{"text":"I could splurge on Amelie's just about any day of the week. NOM to the max. I went to the Uptown location for the second time last week. I love the Uptown location because it's larger and the line looks less out-of-control because of the way they have it roped off and organized. I always go for the macaroons and salted caramel brownie - my favorite macaroon is the cinnamon chocolate. 

My only complaint is that the line here seems to move really slow. Both times I visited the Uptown location, I moved in a really slow line. The NoDa location is often busier and the line moves faster there."}
{"text":"Whenever someone used to visit me in charlotte, I used to make sure to bring them here.. this place should be officially listed as one of the attractions in charlotte..i can never get enough of this place .. I have so many things that i am yet to try..  although its unfair to compare the dishes coz everything is so good...my fav is the napolean.."}
{"text":"Love the cozy atmosphere of Amelie's their pastries are always fresh and delicious. For lunch I often have the chicken salad on croissant and it is indeed one of the best chicken salads I've eaten. 

Amelie's is open 24 hours...which is great when you need a midnight snack!"}
{"text":"I hate to say this but almost hit or miss on this place during finals week at GA Tech. It looked like the baker quit this week, but it was probably so slammed they just ran out of stuff! 

However today I finally tried a Tartine, wild mushroom duxelles. Such a savory breakfast food, the salty cheese that comes on it and the mushroom puree, hits the spot on a place that otherwise only serves sweet breakfast food. Did make me want some type of breakfast potato though. 

Also at noon some lady came in with a restock of Perrier, finally for the fancy sodas. I'm very very excited to try those seasonal sodas."}
{"text":"The Park Rd. Shopping Center location is as good as all of the other locations. I love Amelie's because of their attention to quality and the fun environment they have. Their coffee is great, and I know if I was more daring, their specialty drinks are even better. I had broccoli cheddar quiche for breakfast, and it was delicious.

A great thing about Amelie's is they are opened for breakfast during the week and it isn't a quick-chain place. I had a friend coming into town, and it was hard to find a breakfast place. All of my usual brunch places weren't open, but alas, Amelie's was! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Amelie's, which I have heard from EVERYONE is terrific. Took me a while, but I finally got here. I went from Sunday brunch with a friend and ordered a breakfast sandwich (croissant, egg, cheese, spinach, and tomato). It was delicious as was my cafe au lait. I can't wait to go back again and try more of the menu. Very lively restaurant with lots of seating. It was a little cold when I went, so I will try the patio next time!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and I really truly deeply think it's great for a treat. I have ordered food other than the desserts and it's pretty good. Of course the fan fav is the salted caramel brownie!"}
{"text":"Such a whimsical and delicious local French-themed coffee shop!!! By far, the best macarons I've had in a long time...and did I mention the variety of flavors??? The decor and ambiance is straight out of a fairy tale, Alice in Wonderland meets Amélie (I hope it was named after the movie). This coffee shop was also voted one of the top 100 small businesses in North Carolina. It's definitely a place I shall return to when in Charlotte, Atlanta or Rock Hill. A++"}
{"text":"Nice place for coffee with plenty of indoor space to visit. Much less crowded than the uptown and noda spaces which is nice, so service is a bit quicker. I enjoy the variety of milk and non dairy options. Not the best cold brew though."}
{"text":"Woww last fill visits here I realized I not like before.
Even my quiche come out burned"}
{"text":"how can you go wrong with a french bakery!? salted caramel brownies are the jam from here but i like to try different things every time...and also get the salted caramel brownie...sinful!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is decent, but I personally think it pales in comparison to the original NoDa location.  Part of the Amelie's appeal is the unique ambiance, but at this location it feels as though they've tried making an exact replica; right down to the stainless steel kitchen utensil chandelier and striped walls.

Resting in the heart of Uptown, the vibe isn't as chill.  Parking, as you can imagine, is a challenge, and the line situation is out of control.  I'm sure this location is more alluring to those that work Uptown, but for a relaxing coffee and pastry pitstop, it just doesn't work.

Serving as the master pastry kitchen for all of their locations, this one is much larger.  At certain times you can see the chefs working their magic behind the glass.  There is an area upstairs that is closed off for private events only.  Seating is still limited, simply due to the undying popularity.  Be careful if you sit at the back bar by the window facing MLK.  You have a view of legs shuffling by and you are positioned right beneath the main blower vents for the HVAC system.  

Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the quality of the pastries, sandwiches, and service are less than those in the NoDa location.  Will I continue to visit the Uptown location from time to time?  Sure, but only based on the convenience factor.  If I had my choice I'd always opt for the original.  If it ain't broke..."}
{"text":"Took my family here for breakfast actually and I completely fell in love.  The atmosphere was enchanting, artistic and straight up fun.  The food was delicious - even my kids liked it!  Coffee was delicious and a free refill.  I can't wait to go back to enjoy more of the bakery items.  I envision this as my new \"girls morning out\" place when my girlfriends come to town!  Very Paris-chic!"}
{"text":"Huge place. Like, really huge. Don't know how they afford that much space. Inside is kind of cold though so I sat outside. The pastry that I had, a mini chocolate mousse, was nice. I certainly could've eaten more of them."}
{"text":"4.5 stars...

Had to bump this rating up. The caramel brownie is DIVINE! I'm sitting here nibbling on it since its too good to eat all at once and wallow in misery after finishing it. Try at least once, seriously."}
{"text":"I love the new Amelie's Uptown! We have come in a couple of times since last week for coffee and sweet treats. The lines, unlike the Noda location, travel fast and main hall is very spacious. I ordered multiple macaroons, they were oh so soft and yummy. I have had a problem with the Noda location's macaroons, they can be rock hard for some reason and cold, I suspect they are made a day before and placed in the fridge, bad move. I also ordered a chicken salad croissant, it had good flavor but the chicken chunks were huge.  I was a little disappointed to find the baguettes were smaller than the Noda location, I paid 3.95 for one full baguette, I will only be buying these from the Noda location from now on. The baguette was also not as fresh as I had hoped. 

I have only gotten one drink from here and will continue to keep coming back for it, the café marcotter (MAR-KO-TAY) is delicious. I like to make it a little lighter with almond milk, they do not have skim. 

We will be back for more! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich, and it was just okay. It wasn't hot all the way through, so it wan't the best. The coffee was pretty good, and the honey bun I split with my bf was excellent. The staff was fairly nice, but not overly helpful. The worst was that there were some seriously annoying high school wannabe-hipster girls in there who were yapping loudly at the table next to us. One of them sent her food back because, as she told the server, she was \"allergic to dairy,\" even though she then told her friends (quite loudly) that, really, she was just \"trying the whole vegan thing, like, lol!\" That's not the bakery's fault, of course, but maybe next time I should just get some pastries to go..."}
{"text":"Carmel brownie torte is my go-to dessert. Desserts can be hit and miss, the cakes are usually not anything special, but the food is amazing. Haven't had anything I don't like."}
{"text":"Do not walk out of here without trying the salty caramel brownie!  All of the soups are good as well.  Prices make me consider dropping my rating to 4 stars...but the 24 hour convenience trumps prices in this case!"}
{"text":"I mean obviously not as good as going to France but I will say I got the same pastry here that I ordered in Paris and it was a very good local option. Also a positive that they are open 24 hours so whenever the craving hits you can go get a coffee or a tasty pastry. Never had a sandwich there but will definitely have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I've been in Charlotte for 3 years and never knew a place like this existed...nice job Charlotte!

I'm not sure what to recommend to try, because everything looks SO GOOD! I recently had their White Bean & Ham soup and a Salted Carmel Brownie...YUM-O! 

Also, make sure to get a cup of their coffee...it's nice and smooth! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I don't think you can find a better dessert spot to go to when you want to fill your cravings, literally whenever. Feeling blue at 4am and need a caramel and chocolate something or the other? Amelie's has your back. Want to listen to live music and enjoy a baguette and some tea? Amelie's is there with live music on certain nights. I can say I haven't had any of the main dishes, but man, do I have a sweet tooth. I love this place and will always be back to enjoy and have a nice time with friends, or even by myself."}
{"text":"This is a 10 Star atmosphere and food establishment. When you walk into the area of the dining room there is Decour that cannot be replicated anywhere else. Multiple lines to get you the type of food you looking to indulged in. :)

The coffee is made the quickest. They call out by name. And with a smile. The food is delivery by wait staff with a smile. The food was absolute amazing taste to the right amount."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, chic and cozy decor, scrumptious food options, and chillax vibe - what's not to love and rave about? 

I hope Amelie's remains a staple in Noda for years."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, I had a cafe au lait, so I can't judge too harshly. 

The food selection is awesome! I was a big fan of the gluten free selection! The gf tea cakes were great for breakfast with coffee, and I took a couple macarons to go. The macaron texture a little airy (need to be tapped on the cookie sheet before baking) and they are heavy handed on the dye, but nice and flavorful. 

Atmospherically speaking, this place was fabulous. The decor is lovely and charming, at 5am it was quiet, but I would imagine this would prove the perfect place to chat or work from, especially because it is open 24/7!

The girls at the counter were pleasant, and helpful with all the gluten free questions. If I wasn't from out of town, I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is me and my daughter's secret sneak off place. Atmosphere is wonderful and everyone is so nice. We Love it here"}
{"text":"Absolutely divine -- everything was wonderful. My daughter is gluten free and had so many options to choose from."}
{"text":"This is the way a bakery should be.
Family owned and family feel.
You are treated with smells of good old fashioned home made treats.

With beautiful decor from renaissance to Victorian, this is a unique environment.  With free Wi-Fi and great hours (All day and night), this is a treat and truly a model for bakeries everywhere.

Trying new items, you can expect a new surprise each time.

From sandwiches to multi-cultural desserts, you will not be disappointed when you go to this establishment.

Be prepared.  It is fun and delicious."}
{"text":"No skim milk. Overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait, don't get intimidated by the line it moves pretty fast! The bacon egg and cheese croissant is the greatest croissant I've ever had in my life.  All the sweets here are delicious. Come here every time I'm in town"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Deserts are great and the sandwiches also. Very artsy industrial and raw. Plenty of space and busy. Wish they had one Boston, prob in Somerville, Allston or Cambridge."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Uptown Amelie's location, and I really enjoyed it. I think it is better (see: more spacious) than the original. Yes, it's pricy, but yes, you're also paying for the atmosphere and the name. The pastries are delicious and the coffee was very good. I love the layout of the location - there's a section for each part of the store.

The location is wonderful, and there is plenty of parking, but just hope you get lucky to find one!

Grab some dessert and a coffee, take a seat, and watch some of the delicious foods being made."}
{"text":"I love the NODa location but a larger space was definitely needed a larger space and so happy they decided to put one uptown!  The layout of this one is brilliant, you can see the pastries and baked good while waiting in line so you see and think about what you want before you're up to order. There's a second separate line for just ordering coffee and non bakery items.

The food and coffee are excellent. If you're new to Amelie's I recommend (like everybody else) the salted caramel brownie and the macaroons.  There's a reason everybody says that, they're delicious!  I've also had the quiche and loved it.  I'm sipping on an iced salted caramel coffee and loving that as well.  Now make this location 24 hrs and I'll give it 6 stars."}
{"text":"This place is up and down. Last time I was here, I had a  great sandwich and coffee. Today I went to do a little work and got another sandwich and coffee. This time, the service was rude. The girl behind the counter was apparently trying to get my attention, but was barely audible over the music and talking. She couldn't have been trying for more than a couple seconds, but when I looked back at her, she was rolling her eyes. I ordered a ham,  egg, and gruyere croissant, and a cappuccino with almond milk (lactose intolerant). They ended up messing up my sandwich and giving me a cappuccino with whole milk. I couldn't tell until later, when my stomach started giving me fits. I payed $11 for this, and feel like I was wasting their time in the process. I'll give them another try since they seem to be hit or miss. I'll just have to try to be on my best behavior so that I don't piss off the staff."}
{"text":"Amelie's French Bakery is, perhaps, the loveliest place in Charlotte to have a European coffee and pastry experience. I would say it is the best in Charlotte, but not the best it could be. It is worth visiting just for the atmosphere of the place even though the pastries could definitely be improved."}
{"text":"The baked goods are very goodbye the attitude of the employees leaves something to be desired. The last time I was in there I asked a young lady what flavor cakes were in the case (there were no signs) she actually rolled her eyes at me. I don't plan to go back anytime soon, its just not worth it.  Btw the way I was a somewhat frequent visitor and rarely were the employees gracious, most of the time I felt like a bother."}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite in town to grab dessert. The interior is super cute and it's definitely a great place for date night or girls night. My only thing is that now too many people go and it's too crowded.."}
{"text":"I do like this place and it is close to my home. There is plenty of room inside and I like the decor. Honestly for a bakery, I would not say its the best. I have had better and  there is better. Not that I have not liked what I have gotten, but I would say it is average. Service is sometimes good and sometimes not so good. 

The main reason I like it here is becuase it is open 24/7. I am sorry but that alone is awsome. I know I can get a sweet treat anytime (and I have) So if you have a sweet craving and you are close, or it's late at night, you can come here and satisfy that craving."}
{"text":"I'm considered by many (and myself) to be a food snob. That doesn't mean the food has to be uppity, Michelin star quality. It just has to be done right, with proper ingredients, and proper preparation. 

Amelie's delivers on all of this. I can't believe it's taken me 2 years to find this place since they opened. I've only been there a hand full of times so far, but my goal is to try everything on their menu and in their case at least once (and not gain a ton in the process). 

Their soups are very flavorful. I tasted the Tomato Fennel which had a very surprising and pleasant spice to it (heat spice, just a little bit). I ordered it but when it came time to deliver they were out. I happily substituted the Portabello and Caramelized Onion with Goat Cheese, which I regretted not asking for a sample of to begin with. Very flavorful broth, and I loved the small chunks of goat cheese. My boyfriend had the Spinach, Asparagus, and Leek soup which was very light and flavorful. I've also had the Thai Sweet Potato which was exceptional in flavor. A hint of curry, chunks of sweet potato. I enjoy that none of the soups are served scalding hot and come with a portion of baguette. 

Sandwiches have been phenomenal. I would typically never order roast beef, but after trying the Seeded Roast Beef I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Perfect amount of horseradish and served warm. The Croque Monseiur lived up to my expectations, as I spent about 24 hours in anticipation dreaming about ordering it for dinner that night. Perfectly crisped brioche with melted Gruyere on top... just yum. 

The desserts and pastries.... wow. As someone with a degree in culinary arts who has taken her fair share of baking courses, I fully appreciate the difficulty, complexity, and time involved in baking true French confections. I appreciate that Amelie's does not try to put their own spin on much, rather represent true French cuisine. They do it very well. The eclairs are better than any I've had, and I do enjoy their chocolate bavarian cream filled (one of their few unique twists). The chocolate hazelnut tart is dense and rich, as is one of their small chocolate tort offerings. The coconut macaroons are crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. Salted caramel brownies are to die for.... just insanely dense, fudgy, with a delightfully smooth and creamy caramel on top. No wonder it's an award winner. The cherry turnover had a spot-on flaky crust, but I wish their had been more whole cherries in the filling. Their blueberry and cream cheese danish is hands down the most amazing danish I've had in my life. Other danish do not deserve to use the name. 

In addition to the food, you can't beat the atmosphere. It has a good, positive feel to it and the scenery is always changing. It's a diverse crowd and the owners are very nice people. I kind of wish they had cappuccino/espressos, but now I'm just getting very picky. Add in the fact that they're open 24/7, and it's definitely a favorite in my book. The price is absolutely fair for the quality of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a Salted Caramel Brownie and Napoleon for dessert.  Although the Brownie came highly recommended, we both preferred the Napoleon.  Both items were very delicious, but there was something about that Napoleon that tasted so good!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great place just chill and do research on your laptop or meet with clients or associate."}
{"text":"I went last Saturday and got the chicken salad. I am pretty picky about chicken salad and would give theirs a three. It had great flavoring but the chicken chunks were really big. I also got their cream cheese and strawberry croissant which was good. I was a little disappointed because I had such high hopes from all the reviews and it didn't blow me away. I will definitely go back to try some of the other desserts and see what everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"If you like terrible customers service, loud employees and overpriced bakery items that are not actually cooked from scratch, this place is for you! The was a great little gem when it opened and not it is just ghetto as heck and run more like a McDonalds.  Really too bad.  Must have very poor management or just absentee owners of the business."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and delicious sandwich! I had the build your own breakfast sandwich YUM"}
{"text":"This is a Charlotte/NoDa staple. It's open all night long if you need a treat on your way home from a night out. It's so quirky and cute inside, and when you first walk in the glass counter containing pastries is like something out of a dream.

Salted Caramel Brownie. Enough said."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Just as cute and quirky as the others. I absolutely love the aesthetics of Amelie's. The space is so unique and memorable. I couldn't help but think of all the events I would love to have there. 

I had a French Soda--the Lavender and Honey--and it was amazing. I could have drank 12 more. 

Pastries looked and tasted fantastic (as always!) and the delicious smells alone were worth the trip! 

The only issue I had was with parking, such is life in Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"My go-to place in CLT. The service, drinks, food and vibe are all on point. They also have wine... I mean, who doesn't like a place that serves stellar coffee AND wine."}
{"text":"I would have never known about this place had my girlfriend not lived near Charlotte for a year. She used to hang out here all the time, and when we passed through Charlotte on the way home from vacation, she had to go back for a visit. This is one of the coolest bakeries I've ever seen. It consists of a maze of different rooms, each different from the last, as well as a side patio and back patio that's tucked away behind the building. If I were the hang-out-in-a-coffee-shop/bakery-and-do-work kind of type and lived in Charlotte, I'd be here all the time too.

On top of the awesome layout, they offer some high quality French pastries and treats, and I'm always down for those. Unfortunately, they were out of Napoleons (my go-to), so I went with the layered chocolate torte and salted caramel brownie. Both were excellent. 

We were here on Easter Sunday, and it seemed pretty busy, but I don't really have anything to compare it to. I would have taken pictures, but there's already over 400 posted, so I assumed I would be duplicating other's efforts. I may not be the coffee house type, but I do love sweets and can appreciate an awesome bakery, and that's what Amelie's is. So if you're staying in Charlotte or just passing through (maybe on your way to or from Ohio), it's definitely a sight to see!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and unique ambiance for coffee, sandwiches, and pastries. Went there around lunch on a Thursday and it was pretty busy; but we were served pretty promptly. Our sandwiches were delicious & so was the coffee and chai tea. Lots of seating as well. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast spot! Very similar to the original, but with a waaaay better layout! Even a nice open patio :)"}
{"text":"Oh yes please! 

It's just like the NoDa Amelie's but bigger! Way more space & best tip is they have Beer & Wine for happy hour at the Uptown location!!"}
{"text":"Just the BEST!

The coffee, pastries, breakfast sammies - so heavenly delicious! I enjoy this bakery so much - it's a complete mood changer from my groggy morning self :) Everything just works together here - the decor, atmosphere, smells, tastes, service and even the customers are incredibly polite! 

Best tip about this place: There is SOOO much more seating in the back rooms and even out into the small courtyard/connecting area to other store fronts! Plus they have board games everywhere if you wish to play."}
{"text":"I ::swear:: I reviewed Amelie's back when I visited in February, but I guess I didn't. What a shame! 

I rarely travel for business but I did this time, and it was such a nice break to spend some time away, with 3 nights free to explore and do what I wanted. I found Amelie's through my trusty Yelp app and gave it a try since it was so close to the Vietnamese place I wanted to try. 

The place is huge, on the end of a strip mall, but once you enter you can see how it's such an eclectic, very Euro-country-chic but laid back. A little pricey, but who cares when you are sampling delectable French pastries. I ordered a mocha and salted caramel brown to treat myself that evening, and took home Macaroons for my boys. The flavors ranged from the standard vanilla, strawberry to the elevated and chic: I believe there was a rose flavor and possibly another unique herb-based flavor.

My treat was delicious, my boys LOVED their macaroons, and I wished I had time to stay longer because it was just so comfortable in there. I would go back any time."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. It was a huge, charming, delish coffee/bakery shop.  It offered sandwiches, breakfast, pastries, wine, and the best decor.  You can see them make all the pasties. The macaroons were delightful, i hwas so happy they had rose flavored"}
{"text":"Great desert! Chi Tea latte was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pastries and breakfast. Accommodating to my gluten- free wife. Good coffee as well."}
{"text":"This was highly recommended to me from a work friend in our Charlotte office. The salted caramel brownie is to die for. What a super cool place inside to hang out."}
{"text":"Went in today to try the hot chocolate after watching a travel show that highlighted how much better French hot cocoa is compared to the standard USA version. So, I ordered one and It was delicious but it was even cooler than luke warm. I asked a couple of employees at the cashier's post if my mug could be warmed up in their microwave but they refused and said that would violate health codes. They offered to add hot milk to the cold \"hot\" chocolate, which would have diluted it & changed the flavor profile as well as not doing anything to warm up the current large mug of liquid, so I begrudgingly declined the offer and returned to my table. A bit later, one of the young employees (who said she was a manager) saw me at the table & we made eye contact - she then asked if I was sure I didn't want hot milk added to my now very cool hot chocolate. I explained the dilution problem. She responded that she could have chocolate added, also, but I didn't like that idea. It would be a guessing game bc it wasn't being prepared from beginning to end with proper quantities of ingredients. She then offered to have a new one made. I was hopeful and thought it was appropriate for her to do so.  When she brought the new one over, it tasted nothing like the delicious first one that I had. The second one was very milky with very little chocolate. It tasted weak and boring. There was zero quality consistency. Also, the new supposedly hot mug was barely hot.  I just nodded and thanked her; at that point, it was useless. I won't be ordering their hot chocolate ever again, sadly. Beware, if they don't make your hot chocolate or coffee hot for that matter, you now know that you have zero recourse but to waste the first one and throw it away and/or or have a second one made. What a waste of product and money. Amelie owner/ main manager:  Train your staff to create propely heated hot drinks and food (notorious for serving cold soup) and if you refuse to serve hot food hot, then invest in a microwave for the dining area like some other eateries often do. UPDATE: Amelie management contacted me and was very gracious. Explained that what I experienced isn't customary. Also, its quiche is outstanding, as well as breakfast sandwiches, and tartines. This review and my rating was on the hot cocoa experience"}
{"text":"Recommend for dessert. The egg sandwiches on baguette are fabulous!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed leaving here. The options are a plenty, something for every sweet tooth fix. Very eclectic frequented by almost everyone. 

Admittedly I'm not crazy about the chocolate croissants as everyone else is. I love to salted caramel brownie, German chocolate brownie, and honey buns"}
{"text":"What a quaint little place. Had a wonderful 1/2 sandwich and incredible spinach asaparagus leek soup. I mean, I want to go get more, but I won't be able to fly home with it! I did manage to find the recipe online, however. 

Great meal for less the $9!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which is better; the people watching, the atmosphere or their food. It's the perfect place for a first date, studying or going on after a night out on the town. It's very creative and artsy. It is super cozy and very relaxing. They serve great sandwiches like Turkey and Brie. They also have great pastries, now of course, if you don't like petit fours and croissants, tarts and quiche, don't go. I preferably was looking for cheesecake on first trip and was kindly told it's a French Bakery lol So on my next trip I tried out a few of their cream cheese croissants. Now that was heaven! It gets 4 stars, because it's a great place, but not 5 stars because they should have cheesecake."}
{"text":"Just visited the new uptown location and love it! So spacious and it smells DELICIOUS. I love the open kitchen concept so that you can see the bakers doing their thing. The cafe, of course, has all of the Amelie's staples: Macrons, Salted Caramel Brownies and etc. 
Too bad this place isn't 24 hours like the NoDa location, or else it'd be perfect!"}
{"text":"Macaroons are delicious, but they sometimes lack consistency. I guess it's because they have a lot of people working in the kitchen with various skill levels.

I typically get pistachio, lemon and the salted caramel but when I got pistachio during my last visit they were really DRY and tough to chew, the lemon barely tasted like lemon and the salted caramel tasted like chocolate
I would've brought them back, but I didn't feel like wasting my gas. I love Amelie's but I was disappointed after this trip."}
{"text":"Cafe French press is great..! The ambiance is awesome! I had a hard time find such place when I moved to Virginia, but The Sweet Leaf Cafe in Mclean, VA gives the same feel (in case you were looking). Anyways Amelie's is just perfect..:)"}
{"text":"The pastries are amazing. Wife had creme bruele with blueberries amd i the mini pecan pie. After I wanted the large pecan pie it was soo good. Friends shared a large eclair. 
The atmosphere was so eclectic that we were almost to busy looking at everything."}
{"text":"The decor is cozy and hipsterish, the staff is friendly and its open 24hrs, what a treat!

I tried the salted caramel brownies, pistachio torte, and the salted caramel macaron. 

I think calling the salted carmel brownie, a 'brownie' it's a bit of a misnomer. It's really more like a bar. Half delicious salted caramel and have crispy chocolate cake. Very sweet and very good.

The pistachio torte was my favorite purchase. Slightly sweetened pistachio crumbles and thin layers of vanilla cake and a rich dark chocolate layer. I wish I bought more of these to bring back to ny.

The macaron was well made and comparable to my favorite macaron spot in ny (bisous ciao)."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I am glad I live far from this place!, 2 reason: I will be over-weight and have diabetes(Not to offend anyone). But this place is FABULOUS!.

Every time I try a different pastry but I ALWAYS get and assorted order of French Macaroons. Their cold drinks are very refreshing and Bistro menu is great and tasty. 

The negative... space. Because is a very popular place it will usually be crowded. To add to the space problem there is a bunch of unusual item (night stands, mannequins) that don't really add decor but take up space. 

So the place feels a bit claustrophobic and restraint, well don't let that ruin the experience to enjoy what could be THE best pastries in town."}
{"text":"I read about this place on The Pioneer Woman blog, and when Peter and I planned a visit to Ikea we decided to make a stop. 

We split a Croque Monsier. It was tasty, but next time we come here (the will be a next time for sure!) I'd probably try something else, or skip lunch altogether and just pick up some dessert. 

We got quite a selection of baked goods, and would order most again. We had some macarons and a salted caramel brownie at the actual restaurant. We both loved the pistachio, but the orange and lemon tasted a little bit like Fruit Loops and seemed stale compared to the pistachio.  We took home a box full of goodies (another brownie, an eclair, a chocolate croissant, two more macarons, and a petit four) that we ate over the next couple of days. All were delicious. Peter said the eclair was exactly what an eclair should be. My favorite was the salted caramel brownie, it was heaven. I am a sucker for anything salty, especially sweet and salty, so this is no surprise.

It was totally worth a stop, but I wouldn't make a special trip to Charlotte just to eat here."}
{"text":"This is for the NoDa Amelies......I really like everything about the place...the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable...I have an incredible sweet tooth and this place never fails to satisfy....My personal favorites are the Eclairs and anything with salted caramel. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"so disappointed in their service !! first it took me thirty minutes to get one coffee . the people begind me hot their coffee first two cups!! and not only that but also they skipped me in line ar the beginning !! asking another women who was after me what she was
getting before they even looked in my direction.. needless to say not the way i wanted to get my first cuo of coffee after traffic court! i love their noda location this one i will
not be trying ti go again !"}
{"text":"This review is just the lunchtime kitchen part. The bakery is always #1 in my book.
For some reason the lunchtime crew just can't get it together. I had ordered the Turkey and Brie with seasonal compote on a baguette. The compote was nothing more than Smucker's jam and half of my sandwich tasted like a stale onion. My only conclusion is that someone had just cut up a bunch of onions and did not change gloves. Regardless, the meal was ruined. I will be staying away for lunch but will go by if I need some cake or pastry."}
{"text":"My favorite bakery and place to hang out.  Bring your laptop and get some work done while enjoying the food."}
{"text":"First off let me say...this is a place we frequent due to the fact they are open 24/7 and have FRENCH PRESS coffee!!!

It is like being able to truly just \"get away\" from the norm around Charlotte. 
I also think they have the best french baguette I have ever had. 

Before taking a road trip's to NC vineyards...we swing by and grab a baguette and chicken salad croissant...and a sweet something too!

Amelie's to none compares in Charlotte!!!

The ONLY thing they could add is some great music mix in the seating areas...sometimes it is almost too quiet depending upon what time you are there :+)

The staff is really great too!!"}
{"text":"There's really nothing you can say bad about Amelie's. I even brought my dad's gf who is a French citizen and she loved the place. Raved about their pastries and croque monsieur. We'll always come here."}
{"text":"As there are not many bakeries in Charlotte (so so sad, compared to my beloved Pittsburgh where there were 6 bakeries on my old street alone), this place already gets a good review from me. But, they also feature many exciting, delicious options, and no cupcakes in sight! Thank god. A cupcake place is not a bakery.

This place is faux-French, lots of cute, buttery-goodness inspired by French bakeries but without the price-tag and with more accessibility. The place is also decorated to the nines--it feels a bit like being in Wonderland. Their drink selection is great too!

Their number-system could use a little work. I've repeatedly had to get up and remind servers that I'm waiting for food, while they've already moved on to 6 guests after me. Sigh. 

Be prepared for insane busy-ness at times. And--perhaps--because of that, really shitty baristas and cashiers. They can be very snappy, rude, completely ignore you, and then back talk to you when you try to nicely correct them on a mistake. Hopefully they just need to be retrained on how to deal with a busy environment, and that's not their natural disposition."}
{"text":"I wasn't really that impressed with Amelies. I hear a lot about it so when they opened one near my job I thought I'd give it a try since I've been on this Macaron search lately. Walking in for the 1st time I saw a line. So naturally I stand in the line. The girls behind the case were just looking at me, didn't say a word. I see more people come in and they asked them what they'd like and the customers walked up to the case. Did they really just watch me stand in this slow line for 10 minutes and not ask to help me?? What was wrong with me that they didn't lend me their assistance? Was there a booger in my nose??? When the customers got in line behind me I asked them about the correct ordering protocol and they directed me to the case. Thanks to those ladies for their help. The Macarons weren't that great. Were kind of mushy. It was weird. They were also overly sweet. I took a bite out of each and threw them in the trash. Almost $3 each wasted. I did like how the space was big and open. I would return if I needed a spot to plug in my laptop for a bit and hang out. Other than that, they wouldn't be my 1st choice."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, but the original NoDa location will always be near and dear to me... what's great about the Uptown location is the size.  The signature vertical striped walls are still here, but in a much larger space.  There's also the \"aquarium\" view of the bakers/chefs hard at work to bring you all the treats that Amelie's has to offer.  Kind of pulls back the \"curtain\" on where the all the goodness comes from.... right from the kitchen!

Depending on the time you decide to hit the uptown location, it usually tends to be pretty busy.  The lines move fairly quickly.  THERE ARE 3 LINES!   One for the goods in the case (per usual) and then two other lines to order hot food and coffee.  I've recently gotten a breakfast sandwich here and it was awesome.  You pick your bread vessel, eggs are included, choice of meat, and cheese = the best way to start your morning.  

The location is so big, there are pagers and locators for the table... after you place your order, you get a pager and you place it on the carrier on the table of your choice.  The nice servers will bring you your stuff when it's ready.  Apparently you can do to-go orders and they will shout your number when your order is ready...

No shortage of quirky-decor here... a great place to relax with a coffee, or just hang out and converse with friends.  There's even an outdoor patio with tables - I have yet to enjoy due to the weather - but I'm sure it will be a must during the nice summer evenings in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!!!! The decor is great and atmosphere really transports you when you arrive.  The food and treats really shine here.  I only had a 10min spot to explore, but I grabbed a chicken salad sandwich and french press from the coffee bar.  The sandwich stood little chance... it probably only lasted about 1 minute before I stuffed it into my face and enjoyed the deliciousness.

The dark roast french press was exactly what I needed right before a 3hr night class downtown.

We had a family friend give us a box of Amelie's treats (filled with macaroons and salted caramel brownies).  Talk about sugar overload!  Butt the treats are all worth the sugar crash later.  

If I had it my way, I would relocate my house... heck I would camp outside if (like they would let me.....) to have Amelie's every day."}
{"text":"Amélie's was an interesting place. 

First off the decorations alone are worth the visit. This is easily the most widely decorated bakery/restaurant I've ever seen.  

I went basic and had a cup of earl gray. it was enjoyable and I liked being able to sit at a bar, table, and couch all in the same place. 

My girlfriend and I took home some macaroons that were outrageous. Fell in love with the orange and lemon ones. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I do not know where to begin to tell you how much I enjoyed every taste and morsel I had when I stopped by on Saturday. My husband, and I went to Charlotte from DC to visit my my husband's brother and his wife. They made a stop at your lovely bakery and I didn't know where to start as I was viewing the case... let alone where to stop when choosing what I wanted. I started off with every flavor of macaroon, followed by the petit gauteau (which was heavenly), then the salted caramel brownie (which was to die for)... followed by a longer list of items. Needless to say, when we brought everything home. I was definitely not disappointed and cannot wait to get back to Charlotte to make another stop at Amelie's."}
{"text":"I like Amelie's. I will take any out-of-town visitor there just for the experience and a look-see at some of Charlotte's most bizarre interior design ever. Great place for people watching and gathering with a group. I definitely don't understand the cult-like following this place seems to have gathered, though.

Incredible selection of pastries and all things sweet. But it's almost too much for someone like me- I tend to stick to croissants and baguettes with yummy toppings and cheeses rather than tarts with glazes or macaroons the size of cheeseburgers. 

I think my main thing with Amelie's is that it is sensory overload on every level possible and I'm just not that kind of customer. But will I keep returning? Definitely. Nothing else like it. And besides- once you've tasted the caramel salted brownie you're basically hooked for life, even if you never order one again. The very idea keeps luring you back...."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this spot, but Amélie's did not impress. 

I ordered a mimosa with just a splash of juice (as noted on the receipt) and was disappointed that the bartender didn't follow the instructions. My quiche Lorraine was over baked (notice the dark brown/BURNT crust) and dry throughout. 

I agree with other reviewers that some staff seemed rude (the food runner). 

Will probably not return. I recommend you don't waste your money coming here."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after dinner once. Pretty long line - so you know they're doing something right! But it moves pretty quickly. I got a chocolate croissant that was delicious! My friend that I went with was more of a frequent visitor and picked out something for that night as well as some goodies for the next couple days at home. 

It has a cool coffee shop/\"free wi-fi\" kind of vibe. Definitely had plenty of patrons that were sprawled out with books, computers, etc. Good mix of crowd, students, young professionals, older. 

Neat spot if you're looking for something a little better/different than a starbucks!"}
{"text":"If you don't like Amelie's, heaven help you! This is a sweet and pastry paradise. Tons of variety and they always add or mix up the options. They even have small portions so you don't have to feel guilty about picking out ten desserts. I've never been disappointed with anything but the tarts are my favorite.

The staff is always willing to answer questions and help you pick something out. Unique French themed decor matched with a positive vibe. My only complaint is that I don't live there."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for my best friend's birthday weekend. We stopped in twice this weekend and I really enjoyed this bakery. The staff was nice and very helpful and patient explaining what the items were. I ended up buying a raspberry fruit tart, pistachio macarons, and their seasonal passion fruit strawberry lemonade to drink. All were really good! The tart was sweet, but not too sugary. Just enough tartness to it! I just recently started enjoying macarons and this was so fresh. The passion fruit strawberry lemonade had stronger hints of passion fruit and sparkling fruit soda, the strawberry lemonade taste was not as strong on my order. It was really great!!! I hope I can come back before I leave tomorrow night. I hope to find something similar to this bakery back home in the Philadelphia area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, pretty good desserts.  Good pecan pie.  Do not love the macaroons here, they are a little bit hard.  Try the ones at Le Macaron at Metropolitian if that's what you are in the market for."}
{"text":"Best Creme brûlée in charlotte! I have tried almost everything at this wonderful place and nothing has ever disappointed."}
{"text":"From the time you lay eyes on this little French haven you'll feel as if you're in France (literally). Then you walk inside and become completely engulfed in French inspired décor from towers similar to Eiffel, baker's in those tall puffy white hats tossing dough around in the glass window of the pastry kitchen, bonjour paintings, gold furnishings, candelabras and a salivating. The bakery case is filled with all kinds of delicious goodies: eclairs, cakes, muffins, brownie bars and the most beautiful macaroons EVER. I couldn't help but order one of each flavor:

Mixed berry
Egg nog
Raspberry 
Orange 
Salted caramel 
Vanilla bean
Honey butter cream 
Pistachio 
Lemon
Salted caramel brownie 
Espresso

I wish I could say any single macaroon was better than another but truth is they were all splendid. In the mood for a light snack I ordered a goat cheese brioche (warmed) along with the latte of the day; Hazelnut Praline. It was so gorgeous I didn't want to drink it in an attempt to preserve its presentation. It was even topped with sweet praline crumbs. The brioche was excellent, just enough goat cheese to compliment to crispy sweet puff pastry. Once my sweet tooth wore off I went back a couple hours later for lunch with a few dining partners. Their orders ranged from croissant sandwich to the Pick 2 option, consisting of 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad, I opted for the Spinach & Mushroom crepe with side salad. All portions were small (typical for a French bakery) but very tasty. If you're looking for a meal that will fill you up this isn't it however, it is definitely worth stopping in for a healthy portion of quality food.

{"text":"The coffee is quite good, 5/5. Gluten free pastries are amazing. Gluten free Macrons are much better then ones my wife and I had in Paris.  Having beer and wine is also nice option. Very chill vibe and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Salted caramel brownie is my all time favorite thing here. I love their macaroons as well!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that it's 24/7. The baked goods and coffee are definitely good, but honestly, I feel like this place is a bit overrated. It's got a cool vibe, but I'm really not sure if I would come here so often if it wasn't for the fact that it's open when nothing else is. Perhaps I'm just cynical.

At times, I feel like the place is a bit too casual. One of the employees argued with my girlfriend about whether she had ordered a tall or a short drink once, and started comparing receipts. Fix the drink and then get into the technicalities, eh?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after lunch for some desserts. We ordered a pistachio petit four, a strawberry petit four, a bourbon vanilla peach macaron, and a mini banana chocolate cup. All were very good, but the pistachio petit four was on another level...so amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with great food and desserts! Usually crowded on the weekends but a definite plus is that it is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"This was such a cute find during my trip to Charlotte! Plenty of seating and little areas to set up my laptop and work in. Nice large location, artistic light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, decor that's fun to look at. 

Great spot to grab coffee and study/get some work done."}
{"text":"Amelie's is a very unique bakery located in the NoDa area although somewhat south of the heart of NoDa (on 28th vs 36th).  There is ample parking typically.  The staff at NoDa are always very friendly.  There are lots of great bakery treats and I enjoy the brewed coffee.  WiFi normally works well.  This place can get busy with a line at the counter, and sometimes it can be hard to find a seat.  Speaking of seating, this place is definitely not your typical Starbucks or Coffee Bean.  Furniture is all what I'd describe as \"Old World\" style with lots of couches, one or two large tables, and several small tables.  Amelie's is designed more for socializing with others than it is for entrenching with a laptop but you will find both there.  One of my favorite features is that they are open 24 hours!

My only potential gripe is that occasionally the place can exude a little bit of a less than clean feel.  This is more the effect of the decor than anything, and food preparation has always been of a high standard.  I highly recommend everyone give Amelie's a try!"}
{"text":"What a cool find tucked in a normal shopping center.  It had as close to a French feeing Café atmosphere that a place in Charlotte can have.  Desserts were absolutely on point.  We got the chocolate mouse and pecan tart.  Both 5 stars. 

The chai tea was great too, but only issue was we waited 20 minutes for a tea.  Otherwise though a great spot and a place we will be back too !"}
{"text":"A must-visit when in Charlotte. It's a cute place that is way larger than you would think with quirky eclectic (and a little bit sarcastic) decor that gives the place a cozy feel.

It's a little bit on the pricey side in my opinion so be prepared for that however I ordered a meal and 2 desserts: turkey bacon sandwich paired with spinach asparagus leek, a Napoleon and a hazelnut treat. All very good. It was all kind of messy but worth it. 

My only complaints are dirty tables and the Napoleon which was very good however it didn't cut/break easily and the creme just kinda squished out when pressure applied. I fully intend on returning and trying out more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great pastries and lunch items as well as desserts!"}
{"text":"One of the newest Amelie's in Charlotte (the other being a new, almost secret location on Park Road behind the Shopping Center) this location brings all the fantastic French pastries and mouth-watering soups and sandwiches a little closer to uptown. While the ambience is not exactly the same as there is not the cozy living room/den furniture (or, at least, not as much) as the original location on North Davidson, there is a lot to like here besides the delicious food. There are still plenty of nooks and crannies to sit and eat/study or have a meeting with a friend or business associate as the layout is much larger than the original. While parking is not always easily obtained without paying, if you work uptown and are in a rush or live uptown - you now have a great version of Amelie's to call your own. As the business evolves it will find it's own ambience, right now it's a little too clean and neat compared to the original, but the food is still great and although it does not stay open as late as the North Davidson location, it is still a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Do yourself a flavor and have one of Amelie's Breakfast Croissants! I gave into the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant last night & it was divine! SO GOOD, it made me want to slap my momma, smoke a cigarette, and speak French! Oui Oui! Vive Le Amelie's French Bakery!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to Amelie's for a quiet date. I absolutely love the desserts and tea! It was the perfect atmosphere, the food was wonderful and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Just opened the take out bag from Amalie, eagerly looking forward to my sausage, tomato and spinach breakfast sandwich on a croissant, only to find a turkey, tomato on a baguette. I'm eating it because I don't want to walk back to the restaurant, and it's fine. But after the glowing reviews and seeing the operation over there myself, this is disappointing. Coffee is very good and I'll probably going to give them another chance next time I'm in town, but I'll check my order before I leave."}
{"text":"I don't really like to give reviews unless I've tried something more than once. After 5 visits, I've decided that their macarons are my least favorite out of their selection of desserts. Once you've had macarons from Paris & NYC nothing else compares"}
{"text":"Very pretty desserts but taste it TERRIBLE. 
The cake was so dry and the frosting was rock hard. The filling was ok. I'm not sure why their ratings are so high. Maybe people think looks really are everything?"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this chain, and had a great impression of the one at Davidson.
I decided to check this location out and ordered a cappuccino and a croissant.
Well, that wasn't a cup of cappuccino, more of an instant coffee with a latte-kind of foam. And I asked a barista if it was a cappuccino I ordered, she was positive. It was not cappuccino, it wasn't a good coffee at all. Very bitter, disgusting taste.

A croissant - not fresh, not crusty and just had a taste of old butter. Disappointing experience.
I asked them to replace my coffee with their ice-tea - which is hard to spoil. It was good."}
{"text":"What a great bakery and coffee shop that stays open 24 X 7.

Went here for the first time after seeing a show at the Evening Muse.

There is a theater next door and the performance had just finished so the place was packed at 11p on a Sunday nite.

I had the Creme Broulee which was excellent. They also roast their own coffee beans and the dark roast was exceptionally good.

I like that it's so large and has so many tables and great if you have a group of people."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my dad's birthday from this establishment. I was so excited about it because since moving to Charlotte everyone has ranted and raved about this place. It was far from satisfying. I ordered their strawberry vanilla type cake. It had some fancy name and the ingredients also sounded super fancy so I ordered it. I ordered it to serve 6 people. They suggested getting one that severed up to 10 people so I did. It costed about $35 and I ordered it to be picked up on a Friday. On Wednesday I called to see if I could get it a day early and they said that most likely wasn't possible but they would try and call me if they could. I never got a call that's fine I ordered it for Friday so that was my doing. Well when I picked it up it looked amazing. Beautiful and delicious. Well not the case. Once we sang happy birthday and my dad blew out the candles we cut into it. The icing fell off as if it had been frozen for a few days on there. The cake was  dry so dry as in my mom has to mix in vanilla ice cream that we had to make it less dry. I was so disappointed. I was thinking of calling and complaining but I didn't because I don't like to complain. But I felt the need to write a review. Maybe they made the cake early and left it in the freezer or maybe their cakes are dry and flavorless. I don't know but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Amelies?  The food is great whether it's some soup and a sandwich on a damn good baguette or just some delicious, diet busting pastry. With its laid back ambience, Amelie's is one of my favorite remote work locations of all time. OK. It doesn't beat a laptop at the beach but it's also not 4 hours from my house!

Only downsides of a work from Amelie's day are the slow wireless connection once the joint gets jumping and the $40 or so I drop on food while I'm there. You know how it is... French press and cinnamon raisin bun in the morning, roast beef sandwich and some asparagus leek soup for lunch, bunch of par-baked baguettes and tarts to take home... Small prices to pay for all I get in return."}
{"text":"The Frenchie sandwiches here are legit Yo!

I mean the fresh warm rustic bread, toss in some gourmet stuffings like brie, gruyere, seasonal compotes, pate, spicy mayo then each are matched with an awesome meat or veggie to create a divine lunch.

Of course I can't forget the almond and chocolate croissants which are seriously a guilty pleasure of mine. I scooped some on a mid-day hoping I could hang onto them for breakfast. Yeaaa that didn't quite pan out those awesome pastry delights didn't make it to sunset and I wasn't complaining.

Thanks AFB"}
{"text":"Great place but you already know that from all the other great reviews. They have awesome makes and a large assortment of drinks"}
{"text":"I remember when this place wasn't 24 hours a day, it wasn't what it is today by any means.  For me, this place began as a perfect spot because I was always looking for something that was open late and the early hours of the morning.

But due to the hype and popularity of this place, the quality has definitely gone downhill from the fond memories I originally made here. 

Many of their breads are now sold frozen and I even received a Neapolitan that was rock hard in the middle making it un-edible because  it had been frozen. 

This place does still serve a purpose for me when I'm looking for something because no other places open; however, with the long lines you find later on in the evening it often feels more like a nightclub than a bakery serving great food.

To put it simply, the best thing about this place is that it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"I love a mile away from this lovely little cafe.  The best times to go are during the day to get work done.  Later in the evenings the creepers seem to come out but all the same it makes for good entertainment."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to get a coffee.  A perfect place to sit and chat with a friend or a loved one.
My whole family loves the uptown location so much more though..."}
{"text":"What a fun spot.
It's so artsy, lots of comfy spots to sit, the pastries and coffee is amazing.
The people that work here are all super nice.
It's enjoyable just walking through, looking at everything."}
{"text":"Again this is one of those places i have been visiting for years but just now doing a review. This place has a corky, antique, all over the place vibe and i love it! All of the desserts and pastries are bomb that i have tried. Yesterday i was starving and wanted some breakfast food with a coconut chi tea espresso.Variety, is the perfect way to describe the menu and drinks here. Sometimes myself and friends when we feel like being big kids we will come eat and sit down and play some of the board games they have in there like checkers, and connect four to name a few. Alot of times you come here you will see customers towards the back  sitting or laying on the couches either doing homework for school or work on their laptop for work. Its very easy for me to fall asleep in here sometimes like i pretty much did yesterday lol the people,vibe,calmness,music just everything about this place puts me in a happy place/space. I remember when i first started coming here the only location i knew existed was this noda location. Now they are every where!"}
