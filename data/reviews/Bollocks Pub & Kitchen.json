{"text":"Great food, great service and a great bar! Try the Pickering Eh burger! Awesome!"}
{"text":"A-OK since I've only gone once so far. I've met the new owner and she is such a nice woman, always cheerful and happy to help. I had the Pickering Eh burger and was mildly disappointed. The patties really should be drained (or the ground beef they use should be of higher quality) because the burger turned out verrrrry greasy. The fries have been changed and I really liked them. The sweet potato fries are also awesome since they are thicker cut and actually taste like sweet potato! The drinks are all good, and the atmosphere is GREAT. The new decor is well done and the new paint job looks fantastic. I'd like to see how well it fares on a busy night but all in all a good place to try."}
{"text":"Been coming here for some time now and a couple of months ago, a friend of mine, who is also (what you can say) a regular, mentioned the menu change.  Thankfully they kept the wings, which I still think is the best out there BUT the prices have gone up.  Also, most of the menu items have changed.  I decided to try something new tonight so I ordered their Crispy Chickwich which may actually be a new go-to item.    The portion was huge so I feel it was actually worth the price.  The batter on the fried chicken was perfect, though the chicken could've used a little bit more flavour and a little longer brining time.  It was however, not too dry considering it was made with white meat, so kudos to the chef.  The sandwich also came with some slaw and applewood bacon, so you can just imagine the flavours.  Two of my friends also took a bite and they too loved it.  5/5."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because we heard the wings were good.  We were there with a group, but luckily the place wasn't too busy, as it was a Tuesday night. We ordered the sliders to start, and two flavours of the wings.  The sliders were of a good size, and came dressed with purple cabbage coleslaw and nothing else, no cheese even which was a little disappointing.  The patties looked pre-formed, very uniform in shape , however they tasted pretty good.  The people at the table beside us ordered the burger which looked delicious and had a home made patty stuffed with cheese.  We had food envy.  The wings had about a dozen sauces to choose from and a few signature combinations, I got medium, my dining companion tried a combination, that quite live up to its description.  The wings were of a good size, but not floured.  The sauces were good as well, but the flavour combinations weren't mind blowing.    The fries were hand cut, nothing wrong with them, only that they stuck together in the fryer but that made for a yummy chunk of fried potato.    Overall, the food was pretty good, pretty straightforward.  The server was very attentive as well.  I'm told they make killer margaritas, might warrant a second visit.  LOTS of TV's, you can see a screen from any table at any angle!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this pub with some friends. There's not much to say really, as it looks like any other pub I've been too. They had lots of available seating, which would be good for a night to watch a game. I've heard that this bar used to have another name until it was taken over by new management. I really liked their daily special. I went on Thanksgiving weekend and they had turkey everything! Turkey poutine? Yes please! The serving was also quite large! I was wanting to order 2lbs of wings but have 2 different sauces per pound. The waitress was quite helpful and let us know that they had a special for wings and it came with fries. I was satisfied with the food I ordered. Our waitress was polite, professional, and very helpful. Would go back to enjoy some more grub and kick back a few beers."}
{"text":"Another good pub for wings. The fish sandwich was really good too.  And the service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner, all proceeds from the day went to the Humboldt Broncos, such a loving and supportive fundraiser this restaurant did! Was so happy to be a part of it, and the food and service was top notch! I was a server for over 10 years, so I can totally appreciate what the staff was going through. And they killed it! From the guy working the front door with resos, to our server and the kitchen. Our food was awesome ! I had the burger and my husband had the Cajun pasta, we will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"Manager is rude! Service is slow. Food was great!  Get rid of the manager and the place has great potential!"}
{"text":"I went to Bollocks for wings on Sunday because I had a craving and they advertise a 1.5 pound special on their website and on the receipts from previous visits. When we arrived we asked about the special and the waitress informed us that there was a special on for a pound and a half for $14 with the purchase of a beverage. Although this wasn't written anywhere I didn't argue and ordered a drink. The total comes up to $17.25 which is 25 cents more than their regular 1.5 pound meal. So while it's not a huge deal that I paid 25 cents more for a drink I didn't even want - it's not much of a deal, is it?  The wings took forever to come out which I was understanding about given that the pub had a lot of diners but when the food did come out it wasn't even hot.   Also, I have ordered a pound of wings from here several times before and always get 10 wings, now I know it's supposedly \"measured by weight not the number of wings\" but they didn't seem any bigger yet my pound and a half order also had 10 wings.   I used to be a loyal diner here. I went so often for wings a couple waitresses even knew my order, but since the change last year to menus and specials (not sure if that was because of a change in mgmt/ownership) the quality of the food and service has really gone down. Disappointed.."}
{"text":"It's our neighborhood watering hole.  Great place to meet with friends,  lots of TV's to watch your game.  Good food.  Bring a sweater,  it gets chilly in there  beer.  But the beer is just right"}
{"text":"Just dropped by Bollocks for our favourites- grilled calamari and the Bollocks Fingers....they have lots of choices; Calamari grilled or fried(I recommend you try grilled), so many different sauces for the fingers and wings to chose from. I haven't had a meal I didn't enjoy here. The service is wonderful as well... my only heads up is it is a sports bar so it is loud. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch the other day and took advantage of their check-in offer of 25% off their menu.  Bullocks is located where Shagwell's used to be; tucked in behind Swiss Chalet just east of Whites Road on Hwy 2.  The restaurant has a really nice decor with plenty of seating, a large bar area and tv's scattered throughout. They have a wide variety on their menu and offer a descent lunch menu as well.  My husband had the special of the day: Steak and Egg Sandwich but opted for the Caesar Salad instead of fries. I ordered from the main menu and although everyone has said great things about their Pickering Burger, as soon as I saw there was a burger called 'Blue Bollocks', I looked no further! Any menu item that can make me chuckle has to be good!  The Steak and Egg sandwich was cooked perfectly and although I kinda expected the egg to be cooked over-hard (or at least over-medium), it wasn't... it was a brilliant over-easy egg which allowed the yolk, when broken, to run throughout the sandwich. It may not look like much on the plate but believe me, it was a really hearty sandwich.  The Blue Bollocks Burger consists of half a pound of ground Angus beef nestled on blue cheese and topped with grilled Portabella mushrooms. I struggled to think of a condiment to add that wouldn't compete with the blue cheese and decided to leave well enough alone. The portabella / blue cheese combo is brilliant just as it is.  My ordered came with fries and I added gravy on the side (of course). The fries were somewhat nondescript, in other words, they didn't make me jump for joy and the gravy was far too salty for my palate but had a great consistency. The burger was definitely the star of the show.  The service was great and we really enjoyed our lunch here! I'm rating them an 'A-Okay' 3-star for now until I can try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"This is the top Pub in the area. My grandson has been taking me here for years, and we've never been disappointed. The service and food is excellent. The management really cares about customer satisfaction...  a rarity these days! I recommend the wings; they're just the best regardless of the price changes. Also, huge portions! Yum!"}
{"text":"Got the beef dip $13 as take-out. I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes and it really was ready when I got there within 10 minutes. The service was fast and friendly.  Comes topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms and cheese with a side of fries. The sandwich itself was huge. In terms of flavour it was pretty good but I think the sandwich just had too much different toppings which consealed the beef taste. The largest portion was the bread itself. It soaked up alot of the aju but I would have prefered the bread to be a bit thinner. Overall a very good sandwich but can be very messy so beware of aju rolling down your arm.   On the website it says take-out prices will be higher but I was just charged the $13 and tax. Not sure if this was a mistake but I will take it."}
{"text":"Pleasant place, still a bit young atmosphere. Food was good, Lobster Mac & Cheese and Meatloaf. Loaf was a bit dry. Portions were very generous. Wait staff was new, still learning the menu and business. Overall acceptable and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Bollocks is located on Highway 2 in the plaza that houses the Swiss Chalet, Tim Hortons and Wendys. It's tucked away behind the Swiss Chalet so if you don't know its there, it's easy to go right by it. Bollocks used to be known as Winston Shagwells and apparently is still under the same ownership but changed its name after a much needed renovation.  When I walked in, I was VERY surprised. Shagwells had been a lot darker, felt very small and cramped (not cozy). It was a good local drinking joint for my friends when I was in university but with a massive bar in the middle to navigate around it wasn't ideal for anything but dinner unless you were on the small patio. Now, they've made it a lot brighter and cleaner, still lots of wood but it looks much more open, much cleaner and much more inviting. Definite win on decor compared to before. I would absolutely consider coming here to watch a hockey game or something since they have quite a few more tvs than before.  My boyfriend and I decided to get the fried pickles as an appetizer and I ended up getting Heaven and Heck (I think... honey garlic and jerk?) chicken wings and an order of fries and he ended up with one of their burgers, probably just the Bollocks burger (the website isn't working properly so I can't detail exactly what he got). Fried pickles were Nice and crispy with a great sauce for dipping. Would order these again in a heartbeat.  The wings here aren't breaded but had a nice crispy skin and were well coated in sauce. Unfortunately the sauce wasn't very good. I'm not sure whether they combine the sauces in the back and then toss the wings or if it comes premixed but half my wings just tasted like under-flavored honey garlic and maybe three of them actually had a good jerk kick to them (which still didn't save the honey garlic sauce). The sauce was just far too bland and the wings really needed to be breaded. Unfortunately, the best word I can use to describe them would be boring. The fries were good but nothing to write home about. My boyfriend REALLY liked his burger. He noted that he appreciated that they were hand made, not frozen, and that it had really good flavor and taste.   Overall, Bollocks didn't make the best first impression on me. I was hoping to find a local pub that I could frequent with friends for a drink and some apps or for dinner but this won't be it. I'll definitely give them another shot, they have some good looking stuff on their menu, but since wings are such a big part of the menu, they really need to step up their game with the wings and make some overhauls in that department."}
{"text":"This place is ok but was much better when it was shagwells.  Now the service is mediocre and the wings have shrunk drastically"}
