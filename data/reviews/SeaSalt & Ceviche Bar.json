{"text":"I've stumbled upon this restaurant on my vacation to Montreal. We were greeted by the host and seated to our table promptly. The restaurant was beautifully decorated inside and out. Now that is all positives I can give to this restaurant. We waited for over 30 minutes only to be served water. My husband told the waiter that we were ready to order. He nodded his head and disappeared for another 15 minutes. We weren't going to wait longer so we walked out. The waiter could have offered us a drink or something while we wait or even say that they are backed up and apologize for the wait..."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est agréable et l'accueil sympa. 
Le plat avec du homard était délicieux. Rapport qualité/prix très correct , donc, si vous passez par là, n'hésitez pas !"}
{"text":"The service was a nightmare;
The oysters weren't fresh whatsoever and served in a platter with melted ice (so basically drowning at the  bottom of the platter UNDER the melted ice);
Stay awY from their bloody ceasar, seafood or not, worst choice you will make on that menu;
I tasted a few other seafood items and not impressed whatsoever;
Id be shocked to see this place still open in 2 years;
FOODIES STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"I have no clue what happened to this restaurant. The last time I came was in December and it was awesome; from food to drinks to atmosphere. I returned back last week with a group of 8 people that were visiting from out of town However I was very disappointed with my experience. Our waiter was great and very apologetic but that still doesn't make up for it. For a restaurant this pricey we expected top notch service. 
We made a dinner reservation for the first time slot (6:30). We came here for the lobster and when we all ordered lobster rolls we were told that the restaurant ran out. How can that happen? We are the first dinner seating? Only lobster thing we were able to order is the lobster Mac and cheese and there were only 2 pieces of lobster so it seems like we were ripped off There. We were not notified in advance that the lobster was running out or else we would have walked out. We were not able to have 4 of the dishes because of this. The food took a very very long time to come out and the main course did not come out all together. There was about a 5 min wait until everyone's main course arrived. 
We ordered 5 pitchers and the drinks were inconsistent and it took 15 mins for the jugs to arrive whenever we ordered them. 
We are really disappointed that this has happened to such a great restaurant and unfortunately will
Not be recommending this from now on and will not return."}
{"text":"It's disappointing to see a lot of bad reviews of this place on here due to their seemingly inconsistent service and, from some people, off-putting food. My first experience here was great, from the service to the dishes I chose. 

I decided to stick with the entrées because they were more interesting than the main plates. I mean, why would I pay way more money for fish'n chips or for a regular cheeseburger when I can get that at any good pub? The entrées are worth it: tuna sashimi which was good, shrimp tacos which my fellow diners loved, and mac'n cheese with lobster - very satisfying. Portions for the entrées were surprisingly bigger than I had expected. 

I probably wouldn't go back as they don't seem to garner a great reputation for consistently good service and food. So I guess I can say I was lucky...?"}
{"text":"I came here last night (friday night) with my boyfriend and had a terrible experience. We had called to make reservations a week prior and asked specifically for a table and not a bar seating. The day of our reservations, they called again to confirm with us about the reservations and table seating. Upon getting there, the hostess take us straight to the bar, no explanations. We asked her why the bar, when we specifically asked for the table a week ago. She told us they were overbooked and took off. There were about 8 empty tables in the restaurant!! My boyfriend and I were upset and told our waiter. He went to talk to the hostess and manager and they had no regard for us. Terrible customer service!! I do not regret leaving the restaurant without having tried their food. Not even the manager came to speak to us, seeing we are visibly upset. There is a million other restaurants in Montreal with amazing food and ten times better customer service. I suggest you avoid this place."}
{"text":"I like this place. Great atmosphere, attractive and friendly waitstaff, solid food and drinks but nothing too amazing. I feel the prices are reasonable for the location and the quality of decor and service. I wish the menu had some small plates or side dishes for grazing. The table next to us tried to order the tomahawk ($145) but they did not have it, and were offered a huge filet as a substitute. I had the shrimp tacos which had good flavor. Cocktails were good. Would recommend for a date or enjoying a beautiful evening outdoors."}
{"text":"The seafood itself is good, however it's a bit pricey for what you get. The service was not great-- waited at the front to be waited for what felt like forever while wait staff made eye contact, but never helped us. We were seated without food menus, and our waitress didn't seem thrilled to have to get us some. We the. Waited for ceviche for a long time, while other tables around (seated after us) got their food. It's loud, the neon rose all day sign takes over the room (which is ironic, since there's only one rose on the menu). The food itself as I said before was cooked well. However the portions are very small for the price. Looks cool from the outside, but definitely can be skipped."}
{"text":"I'm warming up to this place. Of course, there is the usual cheap scene peeps...food Is rather decent. Like the fish tacos and the spaghetti alle vongole. Cocktails could be improved, especially the Old Fashion. But...it's close to work, thus no issues dropping in late after work for a bite and drinks.

Ya, I've returned...and sucked big time."}
{"text":"Overpriced, slow, totally underwhelming. 

Lunch was a very disappointing experience. 

$30 lobster roll was by far the worst we've ever eaten. It tasted like fish instead of delicate lobster. 

The lobster grilled cheese was equally nasty.
Not to mention maybe a table spoon of meat on the whole sandwich.

The only bright spot was our server. She was very nice."}
{"text":"Came here 3 times once for brunch, once for dinner, and another time I got wasted. The drinks were great so was the music and atmosphere. So the diner time was OK the servings were quite large but the entree was not amazing, the appetizer was. Brunch here was super good, I had a lobster benny and that was nice and the price was right. The time I came for drinks was good too nice music and strong drinks, maybe a bit too strong, and left a dent in my pocket."}
{"text":"So sad to write this review because the restaurant is lovely with beautiful views. Our server was so nice, but everything was incredibly slow. It's difficult to determine why. We visited early afternoon, I don't feel it was too busy, there were at least 2 servers. Every single step of the meal took too long. Perhaps they have too limited a staff in the kitchen and bar or are poorly organized. The food is not inexpensive and the menu is small, so they should not have been out of any menu items, which they were."}
{"text":"Ambiance and location are fantastic so is decor inside and outdoors. Service is terrible, we had to remind the staff twice that we were there and after waiting for a good 20 min they did not even manage to bring water or a beverage. Spend your time and money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had just finished a walking tour and decided to stop by for brunch which was just ending and the shrimp tacos were amazing (albeit a bit overpriced for the portion size). An FYI -Being near the port makes everything more expensive."}
{"text":"Great spot for attractive people watching. I showed up on Thursday, where they had a dozen oysters and a glass of rosé for $20 (between 5pm-9pm). Tina, the bartender was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a tough place to rate... The location is great for a night out, the vibe in the restaurant is fun, and the ceviches are quite good! So, why only 3 stars?

1) The $25 ceviches are basically appetizer-sized. The Japonais has the equivalent of 1 large scallop, 1 shrimp, and roughly a quarter cup of white fish. Although tasty, it was definitely not worth the price. I guess that's what happens when your overhead is so high. 
2) The menu is not accurate. Certain items were not available, which is understandable. What's not is that 2 items were no longer being offered at all. We tried to order the coconut Thai calamari, but the waitress told us it had been taken off the menu for 2 months. As for the octopus salad with watermelon and feta, this is only available during the summer and is changed to a ratatouille salad in the winter but is not described on the menu. The menu is simply a printed 8 1/2 x 11, so just print a new version! 
3) The service is pretty slow and the staff don't work as a team. We were seated at the bar and saw our plates at the pass for 10 minutes. Three people walked by, looked at the tickets, and kept on their way. Finally, after chatting with her colleagues, our waitress glanced over, saw the plates, and brought them to us. 

Sure, it was a nice place, the food was good, and the atmosphere was upscale. I guess it's worth visiting once, but it's not a place I'd go again."}
{"text":"Amazing patio overlooking the water. The drinks were great. Recommend for outdoor seating and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Yelp doesn't lie, ladies and gents -- Yelp doesn't lie. This place, despite my hopes that my experience might exceed the Yelp rating, really does deserve a meagre three stars. 
We had a plate of a half dozen raw oysters, which were OK but a bit small, and no horseradish (they gave us a bottle of Frank's hot sauce instead). My shrimp tacos were fine but nothing special -- one large shrimp per taco, with lime wedges that had no juice to be squeezed out of them no matter how hard I tried! My partner's lobster mac and cheese was the real disappointment, though. Skimpy on the cheese, and wherrrrrrrre was the lobster?? Basically an overpriced bowl of shell noodles. 
Anyway, the vibe was OK -- the servers were all energetic and polite high school kids who were dancing around to the music and generally enjoying themselves. Our server was a sweetheart. 
Based on the quality of the oysters and other seafood we tried, I can't say I'd be tempted to try the ceviche, but hey, I'm always hopeful for one redeeming factor. If you try it, let me know how it was!"}
{"text":"stumbled upon the place while wandering Montreal on vacation.  It was exactly what we wanted for a mid afternoon drink and snack.  We tried the Peruvian Ceviche and the Columbian Ceviche.  The Columbian was fantastic and the Peruvian was great but not as good.  The oysters were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Accueil correct mais sans conviction (en début de soirée) mais avec un enfant de 10 ans, on vous place dans l'arrière salle qui n'a aucun charme avec des prétextes bidon, alors qu'il restait des places à l'avant. Bonne qualité de la nourriture et du plat en suggestion mais rapport qualité prix vraiment discutable . Service correct mais longue attente pour le plat (plus de 35 minutes!). Assez bruyant. Bref, pas une adresse pour sortir en famille. Plutôt un endroit branché pour prendre un verre avec musique non-stop."}
{"text":"We were a group of 11. Service was terrible... we waited about 45 min for our drinks. They probably were ready in a timely matter because the ice was very melted and they tasted like water... as for the burger, well it was tasteless and rubbery.. waiter didn't ask if everything was good.. they also forgot to serve dishes that were ordered. Anyhow big flop. If you must go there you should stick to wine (since there's no prep!) and fries..."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant 4 times. The food is average but the service is terrible. Most recently had a birthday there with a fixed menu. They decided to switch our courses after the menu was set, then they provided us with 3 dishes instead of the 4 included in the price. They then didn't serve us our desert (again, included in the fixed menu price) but did charge us each a $3 cake cutting fee for the cake we brought in. After we complained about not getting our desert and getting charged an extra amount, it was adjusted."}
{"text":"I have never been so motivated to write a 1 star review. I was incredibly disappointed with our experience at SeaSalt & Ceviche Bar. Let me explain:

We had a reservation here booked for months, as it was for 14 girls during my bachelorette party, on a Saturday at 1 PM (normal time). Upon arrival, the place was empty, which was fine and had me excited that we would have good service - boy, was I wrong. We sat down and it felt like a long time before the waitress finally came by with water. We learned this was her first day on the job, which is fine, but why would the manager put the newest person at their restaurant to a table of 14, I will never know. It must have taken 15 minutes for her to get our drink and appetizers order - however we didnt get our drinks for another half hour or more. We were also pretty upset as upon ordering our apps, the waitress comes back and says they are out of half the apps (the shrimp cocktail, the salmon crudo, and the poutine) - we found this very odd considering there was nobody even in the restaurant (and they did have shrimp tacos and fries available) as well as the fact that this was half of their appetizer menu they were out of. 

Finally we realized how long everything was taking so we decided to just put our order in. I'm not even kidding when I say that it took her over 45 minutes to write down all of our orders. As the waitress had no idea about the menu, and had to keep going in the back to ask the chef questions, we finally called over the manager and expressed our concerns about her being able to handle our large table, especially as we had strict dietary restrictions. At that point, he checked in with the waitress and then the manager just disappeared as the waitress took another 20 minutes to continue with our order. It is now 2:30 PM and we have no apps and our order just finished (again, reservation was at 1 PM). After she finally finished writing down our order, she went to the back to get appetizer plates and started placing them down, however, she still had not done anything with our order and had not inputted it into the computer yet. At this point my mind is blown with the poor service and the fact that the manager was doing NOTHING to manage and help the situation.

When we finally got our food hours later, I was hoping it would be the most amazing meal ever to justify us going to what seemed like a cute, delicious place, but unfortunately I was proved way wrong. The food was sub par - lobster roll was fishy, burger was dry. 

With all of that said, I suggest that you pick a different place for your lunch as with the service, uninvolved poor management and mediocre food, it is not worth a single penny."}
{"text":"This place has a great terrasse but it was full so we had to sit inside. The inside is really pretty, very beachy looking and the service very attentive. I went with someone that eat ceviche on a regular basis so as another commenter mentioned, the ceviche was tasteless according to my friend. We also had the kale salad, it was good as were the battered shrimp. His cocktail was good as was my rose wine. So all in all, its a nice place to go for drinks and a light bite but they need to change the name of the place to just Sea Salt and drop the ceviche from their name because it clearly isn't a go to place for ceviche."}
{"text":"I noticed SeaSalt right after we'd finished dessert a few doors down on a late afternoon. Menu on their outdoor display and prices, seemed reasonable and made a reservation for 7 o'clock. We pretty much had SeaSalt to ourselves and I wondered why. But anyhow...we stayed. 

Nice on the eyes with a bit rustic and somewhat modern feel. Bar Area is gorgeous and takes much of their center space. Hostess for whatever reason sat us by their freaking neon pink sign (and hadn't realized how bad my pictures would look). 

I'd requested to move away from that nauseating sign but everything after that, somehow happen simultaneously: sitting down, the waiter bringing my cocktail and spilling midway (which he apologized for) while nervously wiping the table. At that point, I just stayed there- behind that awful pink sign and snapping freaking pink pictures. Any...how...

Our waiter- after that episode, seemed to be on the up and up- and even friendly. We started with 1/2 dozen Oysters Rockefeller served on none other- sea salt. The Parmesan, the Spinach and those Oysters- were very good. My \"Beam Me Up Scotty\" cocktail, lacked strength and at most, had an impressive presentation. And that's the only thing, it had going for it. 

I almost went for their Grilled Octopus with Ratatouille and Chorizo- which SeaSalt could've prepared sans pork for me (thank you) but my husband instead, went for it. I eyed a Linguine & Seafood dish- which actually turned out good: al dente, Succulent large Shrimp, Scallops and Lobster in a chunky tomato sauce. 

If anything, food wasn't horrible- it was just comforting at that moment. Overall, this is just a 3 and 1/2. It wasn't a whole package and didn't knock me off my feet."}
{"text":"My husband and I never complain about restaurants in Montreal. We went here today for a nice cocktail and oysters......cocktail was watered down - oysters were warm, had dirt in them (including a worm), and shells...Overpriced for nothing! When you are paying for overpriced food and drinks at least make it bad ass!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Seafood Ceviche and Fried Calamari! Both very fresh and delicious. The tenderness of the calamari and the flakiness of the batter made a perfect delicious pair. The ceviche was very refreshing. The staff was very attentive and our service was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Caesar=best we ever had 
Salads=best dressing with the kale leafs 
Cerviche-delicious 
Service -wonderful 

Best bachelorette brunch spot !!"}
{"text":"This was recently mended by our waitress at lunch. We arrived and I immediately thought this place is really cool and trendy, but I assumed food would be too trendy and disappointing...BUT it wasn't! I've had lobster rolls in Maine and this was by far the best lobster roll I've ever had. It was so buttery, flavorful and full of chunky lobster meat. My husband had the kale and beet salad which tasted fresh and was delicious. The tuna tartare was so flavorful and had the right balance of coriander and spice. Service was attentive and the place definitely had a really hip vibe. Would patron again!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here. Since they are named after ceviche, I think it must be a specialty. For a 19$ seafood salad the portion is very small. Nothing like I had in Mexico. The salad leave has white hairy mould, since the place was busy and the service was slow, we just picked out all the leaves. And finished the food. So sad. I have to take off one star. 
--------------
My friends picked it for brunch on a Sunday. This place only offer brunch once a week on Sunday. It's a seafood restaurant but we came here for brunch. It's unreasonable for me but it's my friends' big day. 
We were at first the only table there and I was nervous about the brunch and till the end of our meals the restaurant got busy. I was relaxed. 
I was told this place is popular on Instagram but I never got the interest to follow ins hype. I already got Yelp for all the reviews and recommendations. 
I ordered an egg Benedict with smoked salmon. The side dishes surprised me but the English muffin was not so tasty, didn't get baked and tasted old. The portion was small. 
They don't have seafood for the brunch but we stick a little and then had some oysters to finish the meal. They are divine. I would only take seafood here if I come again."}
{"text":"Ok so reading the reviews, this place isnt getting its fair share. First of all it's a great bar. Definitely fun for a weekend night (and thursday too.) Restaurant wise: Yes, entrees are on the pricier side, but that's what you get in the old port. Appetizers are of decent size (we took one each and it made a meal) and more affordable. I loved this place for the lobster mac & cheese. I was told to try it, and I loved it; and ill go back for it. Our server was wonderful. He came a few times to check on us, made sure the busboys were filling our glasses frequently, and asked a few times if our food was satisfying. Personally, I consider this to be great service, above most places in the old port.
Im not giving it 5* because when we went for dinner at 9pm, the music was so loud that we couldn't hear each other. But food, drinks, and service wise, this place rocks. And if you're on a really tight budget and cant afford an awesome $30 dinner, there are plenty of other places in town that will fit your needs, but no need to bring this place down!"}
{"text":"Excellente musique . Et le ceviche est trop bon ainsi que les cocktails , les service est à la hauteur . J'ai pas encore testé les brunchs et ça va être sur ma liste"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Seasalt & Ceviche Bar on a Friday night. We made a last minute reservation and the only seats they had left was at the bar which was fine with us. However when we got there it was pretty empty and only started to fill up halfway through our dinner. I started the night with the Seasalt Ceviche Caesar. On top of the Caesar was shrimp, grilled octopus and cucumber. I was honestly a bit disappointed with my Caesar because the actual cocktail was so watered down and there was way too much ice. The seafood on top was fine though. We shared the Asian style salmon tartare with shrimp chips. I just realized that they were shrimp chips! thought they were just regular chips! Lol They had some on both sides of the salmon but the texture was different. On one side the chips were harder and thicker and on the other side they were thin. The salmon tartare was delicious and fresh. Then we shared the Portland style lobster rolls with house cut fries. It was so good! They really put a lot of lobster in the rolls and the fries were crunchy and had the right amount of salt. I made sure to finish all the fries on the plate. We also shared the grilled 16oz ribeye steak with shoe string potatoes. At first I thought they were onions. The steak was medium rare some parts on top it was a bit black but inside was perfectly red and the meat tasted very good. You could really taste the steak spice and it was a bit spicy. There was a lot of fat on the steak which I loved. We were struggling a bit to finish the plate but I managed to finish it. We didn't get dessert. 

The resto seemed to be happening. I liked the vibe. It's a good place to take a date or go with a group of friends after work. There was a lot of people standing at the bar. The music wasn't really my style - dare I say house music ? but I assume it would get better later on in the night. I recommend this restaurant. I went a long time ago when it was Communion and the place has really changed since."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday - we were a party of 8.  The staff sat us in a booth with a low table in the back.  The staff was nice and clearly eating on a Saturday evening, they were overwhelmed.   Its fine, we wanted to have a \"supper club\" experience.  

Turns out the booth was to be shared with another party, we were 14 in the booth, rending the table too small for all our plates, forcing us to eat with our plates on our laps.   Our reservation was for a late dinner, although we were instructed before our plates were done that we needed to buy bottle service to stay at our booths - if not we needed to leave.   We rushed to finish our meal to then head over to the bar for a drink.   

Food was ok, portions were small, I would avoid it on a Saturday evening if you plan on having a dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with about 8 people. The ambiance and decor is very nice. The restaurant is well located and has good music throughout the evening. For the food, I would have to say it's the worst ceviche I've ever had. Seeing that the restaurant is \"specialized\" in ceviche, I found it very BLAND and had no taste at all. Also, the portion for the price is a but overpriced. The beet/kale salad was OK and was a bit tasteless. The drinks were OK and service was a bit slow. Overall, you come here for the ambiance and not the food."}
{"text":"Definitely Not what it the hype is about. Terrible...terrible...terrible service. Not a good restaurant. Food was not good and way overpriced. We got sick right after we left."}
{"text":"I went for Oystermania so I had 12 oysters with a glass of white wine for only $10! I had a reservation at 6 pm for 3 people and sat outside which was a very nice terrace. Considering it was in the old port, their outdoor seating was conveniently placed in an area that wasn't too crowded and it was cozy with the blue cushions on their wooden chairs. Inside, since it was still sunny and not busy, I was able to notice the decor which seemed nice and modern with the marine accents, a big bar in the centre with a seafood display and the bright iconic pink neon \"Rosé all day\" sign. The oysters were delicious, well shucked and a good size. However, the only condiments they had were mignonette, Tabasco and some sauce they claimed was amazing with oysters but was only okay. I would have expected a seafood place to have more options than that, or even have horse radish. I also ordered the seafood Ceviche and the octopus Ceviche. Both were amazing and so refreshing! I was very surprised by how tender and not chewy the octopus was. Service was good, although the waitress took a while to give us our bill but was attentive to us. Because I got a deal on oysters, I say that it's worth it but otherwise it's quite expensive for the portions. Also, as I was looking at the drinks menu, I noticed a pitcher of sangria was $70 which to me is absurd and not worth it. So if you ever come here, go with a budget and sit outside on the terrace."}
{"text":"Such an amazing interior and atmosphere.  A colleague and I stopped in for a quick glass of Rose sangria this afternoon.  Delicious and just what we needed.  Good service, looking forward to having dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Cool place w nice decor. Very well situated in the Old Port a bit away from the tourist crowds. Make sure to reserve 2 weeks ahead if you're planning to eat there on sat night. Terasse is huge & has a view of the fireworks. The terasse menu is reduced. Plates were very good. Worth the wait! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It is a beautiful space and the service was very nice.  The music was also lovely. However, I found it quite overpriced. As a New Yorker I am used to pricy meals and don't mind spending when warranted but the $26 ceviche was a complete rip off. Wine was delicious. $70 with gratuity for one small ceviche to share, fries and a glass of wine was extremely steep. They would do well if less attempt to be fancy and prices were more in line with surrounding options."}
