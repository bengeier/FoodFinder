{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and gave it a try.  I'm glad we did, the food is great, the wait staff is friendly and helpful and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE! Affordable prices, great service and awesome food!!! If you ever have a chance to go, GO! I went with a big group. We tried all the varieties and everything tasted great! I will definitely be back. TRY THE AGUA FRESCA /FRUIT WATER!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always like to find a local independent restaurant when visiting a city, International House of Food was worth going across town for. Our waitress was very friendly and the service couldn't have been better. We ordered from the Mexican food, I ordered what our waitress suggested \" juarache \" and I was very pleased, every thing was fresh and hit the spot. Next time we go I would like to try the Chinese cuisine it looked great."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the Mexican food actually tastes authentic! Love ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, yummy natural fruit smoothies made with just fruit and water and great service with a smile! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such a friendly, welcoming place! I came to Phoenix from California for a conference and came to IHOF for birthday dinner. They have Mexican and Asian food, lots of options for different palates. They serve breakfast all day too! :) Jose was an awesome, attentive server. We would come back if we're back in town."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff. Stopped by for breakfast at 1pm. Food was hot, good quality, good taste, fair price. Next visit we'll try the Asian menu.  Recently remodeled. Clean restrooms, clean dining area. Nice setting and environment."}
{"text":"I heard about their taco tuesdays from a friend and ended up stopping by. Tacos were good but the next time I came, I tried the Mongolian chicken and I am hooked - delicious! Great food and good service."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and good. This is a small family run place which is the type of place I prefer. Prices are good, staff is friendly and the portions are just the right size.   We came to this place because of the Yelp reviews and it was spot on.  Not fancy, but clean with good food."}
{"text":"This place gets it. Nothing fancy just good food served with a smile. And very cheap. Just found my new go to breakfast spot. AND for those who live close, they deliver. SOLD!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and have always been Satisfied. This is my 2nd time eating the Pad Thai Noodle dish and it's Amazing.The Fruit water is  Addicting as well,Love the service!!! Waitress Elizabeth is a Great Watress.I Highly recommend this place. :) :) :)"}
{"text":"First time here, thanks to yelp, but the place was definitely not worth the 4.5 yelp stars. Ordered the special combo with a side of toast. The sausage and bacon were decent, however the eggs were worse than what we make at home or maybe just at par. Now coming to the pancakes. They tasted like those frozen pancakes thrown into the microwave and served on a plate. This is after I had asked while ordering if the pancakes are made fresh!! They won't have told me that they aren't! Oh well! Hubby got the breakfast burrito and it was very average, definitely smaller than what we have had before at other places. Salsa served with it was a joke!   Definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by its cover. I usually stay far away from places that specialize in ALL kinds of food because it must mean that it's poor quality. But not here! I got a burger and my friend, sweet and sour chicken. Both dishes were fantastic! Our waiter, Jose, was extremely attentive, introduced himself and shook our hands. He noticed we were catching up and told us to take our time even though they were now closed. After we finally realized he was closing up, we got up to pay. We went outside and chatted for another hour or so and on their way out, the cooks who made our food thanked us and wished us a goodnight. If I lived in the area I would visit IHOF frequently."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and had what consisted of a Grand Slam at Denny's. The price was right and service was friendly. As for breakfast, this is a good option."}
{"text":"This place was aweful! Soggy French fries, Soggy hash browns! Worst biscuits and gravy in my life. Waste of money, hate to say it but better off at dennys, enough said."}
{"text":"Juan and his phenomenal staff catered our wedding for 125 guests with amazing, delicious Mexican and Asian food! The food was hot when the buffet line opened and the flavors just as good as in the restaurant. The food was so reasonably priced (under $2000) and all our guests raved about how good it was. The owner Juan is the most kind and patient man. He was easy to stay in touch with  and helped along the way, even helping to calm this nervous bride :) He was NEVER pushy about selling us what we didn't need or didn't want. He made sure to support us in all our decisions and helped us make sure there was more than enough food for our guests to enjoy. His staff was even willing to help cut all our cake for the reception. They go above and beyond any other restaurant in regard to affordability, flavor, kindness, and professionalism. I encourage any bride who want DELICIOUS, affordable food to call Juan and the international house of food, they made our wedding so special!!! Thanks to Juan and all your wonderful staff!!!! We can't thank you enough!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time. The food was really yummy and the service was excellent.  Everyone was super friendly. The location may look a little scary from the outside, but it was very clean and comfortable on the inside and showcased a beautiful mural from a local artist. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I was shocked that 29 people had even been to this place when we drove up for lunch today. The menu is a decent size but they might be trying to do too much. I had the chicken club. The bacon was great but the chicken was chewy (tasted like it was thawed too quickly). The diet Pepsi also had a strange taste. Next time (I'll go back because it was alright and super close to work), I'll get a BLT because that bacon was 2.8 of my three stars."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to IHOF. It was delicious! Homemade food and family atmosphere. The prices were fair and it was very clean. The staff was very attentive and inviting. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time an was very glad I did.. The restaurant is very clean, the service was Excellent, our waiter Jose made sure we had our drinks refilled an was checking on us to make sure we were ok. The food was Great and fast served. Ive passed this place several times but never took the time to eat here, today im glad i stopped by an brought my little family for lunch, i will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place after reading the great reviews on yelp, but not agreeing at all. The food was just ok and not worth the price. The substitutions and extras are also not worth it. Got the fried rice instead of white ($1.25 more) which had no flavor so there's no point in the substitute unless you're really keen on a lil crunch from pieces of carrot. Also got a side of pico de gallo (only .75 more but the saddest pico I've ever seen) was very dry and 80% cilantro. The front dining area had a faint smell of dirty mop which is very unsettling while trying to eat your food. The service was fine, but definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. I can't say I had an experience that others had where they had amazing food. I went with my family 2 hungry guys and my 5yo. We all ordered breakfast, my husband had the steak omelette (which he said was good, not great) one son had the breakfast burrito (which he said was great),  my other son had the waffle, (which he said was great) , I had the big breakfast which I would say was good, not great.   What I can say was great was the service. Our hostess was super nice and super helpful, which I value highly in restaurants now days.   All in all, I like IHOF and give it 4 stars (they get +1 star because our hostess was soooo nice)"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food was good. Tried their Mexican menu. Will try breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Elizabeth was amazing and everyone's food was delicious. The real gem of the meal was the watermelon water. Don't forget to order one!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and very authentic with breakfast preparation. Been here several times and always have had a great breakfast. Always very courteous excellent service. Meat lovers combo with waffles is a must. Anytime I'm in the area for a meeting I stop in. Great food great prices!!! Elizabeth is a great delight and wonderful server. She always has great attitude and makes sure you feel at ease. A must try for breakfast."}
{"text":"The first time I ended up here, it was because it was within walking distance of my hotel, and why not? It was so good that I rearranged my next cross-country trip to stay in the same hotel, so I could eat here again. I love it!  They're pretty proud of serving everything all day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The variety is amazing, but everything my kids and I ordered was really good. I focused heavily on Mexican breakfast foods, but my sampling of other dishes that my kids ordered suggest everything is equally delicious."}
{"text":"Well priced, good breakfast. From the outside it looks run down but inside was very clean and nice. I felt very comfortable and food was good. I look forward to going back for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food for a great price!  Our waitress Elizabeth was wonderful :) will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Truly a hidden gem!!! You definitely can't judge a book by its cover... although the exterior may not be easy on the eyes the inside of this place you can tell is very well maintained and clean. I been here a few times and must say no complaints the staff is amazing and super friendly! I've tried many dishes and have yet to be disappointed! Chicken enchiladas with rice and beans are my go to but the super chicken sandwich w/French fries is also one of my top favs!  I would HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone and their mothers!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the Porkchop and Eggs.  Porkchop was tender and flavorful.  Came with hash browns and pancakes.  Can't wait to come back and try their Chinese menu.  They have 3 different cheers that prepare Mexican, American and Chinese. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I downloaded the yelp app just so I could review this. I ordered delivery from them. First time ever. I ordered their burrito which cost over 7 dollars with added pico and extra cheese. First of all there was almost no cheese anyway. Second, the burrito was 4 inches long, at the most. I asked for no rice and they put it in anyway. When I called to inform them they said they were sure they didn't add any but if they did they would take the burrito back and bring me another. My fiance ordered their orange chicken and she got more carrots in it than chicken. Her iced tea tasted like water and they didn't bring any sugar. I suggest not ordering from them unless you like to gamble with your meals and hard earned money."}
{"text":"Cruz took excellent care of us today. Not rushed and tasted like my mom was in the kitchen. Good job IHOF!"}
{"text":"First off let's say I'm a country boy from Missouri. Walked into a very friendly environment.  Strawberry water , watermelon water!  Black mans dream  Pork chops and pancakes I recommend this for food lovers Hahahhahaha"}
{"text":"Great place...Cruz and Jose awesome servers ..Food to die for...atmosphere..cozy . Many choices truly international...we had  American, Chinese and Mexican all in one sitting!! Price is reasonable and amount of food was great took some home....thx"}
{"text":"Had 3 tacos with rice & beans plate, the pastor was delicious! Meat was flavorful, salsa was spicy and everything was fresh. Fruit water of the day was watermelon and blended to order so I was even more stoked that I stopped in to eat here for the first time.     I will be coming back. Service was excellent and almost full service, you just pay at the register at the end. Inside was very clean and though minimal decor, a large mural spanning two inside walls gave the place some personality.    Outside lacks curb appeal, but the area is safe (I live 2 blocks away) and seeing it so much it's quirkiness has grown on me. I get that it's a breakfast/lunch place, but only thing I'd change is to be open later. I'd love to come for dinner but closing at 6pm is too early for me!"}
{"text":"I ordered the waffle combo and tried some of my stepdad's huevos rancheros. The waffle breakfast was like any other breakfast I had. Not bad, but not special either. The huevos rancheros we ok, but not amazing either. Friendly staff. I feel as though I should give the Mexican and Chinese food a try to give this a place a fair rating."}
{"text":"This place is good!  We're going on a roadtrip and decided to go on a tour of Chase field and yelped places around the stadium. It's about 1.5-2 miles from the stadium and it serves American, Chinese,  and Mexican food. Dafaq?!!  We had to check it out. Got there around 10:15. We ordered the watermelon water,  orange chicken,  and French toast combo.  Everything was really,  really tasty. The watermelon water was made fresh to order and it had just the right consistency and sweetness. The orange chicken was crispy, crunchy and juicy without being mushy and sickly sweet. The French toast was also perfect. For a total of $22, it was great deal for the amount of food and the taste.  The service was awesome too!  The lady (can't remember her name) was fast,  friendly,  and helpful.  Next time I'm in the area,  I'm definetely going back here!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the watermelon agua frescas, however I tried the Hawaiian fire chicken dish and it wasn't particularly my favorite. I'm not sure if it was something about the texture of the batter that they fried the chicken with or what, but I would probably try something else if I go back. Friendly staff and clean."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised.  I wanted Chinese food and my wife wanted anything but. So she found this place on yelp.  First of all, the service was excellent. But that was just the beginning ...  I have traditionally avoided places that serve different cuisines, because I have found that these kind of restaurants try to be all things to all people, and everything turns out mediocre at best.  Well, this place really surprised me. I got Hawaiian Fire + Fried Rice + spring rolls. Very tasty. My wife got the guacamole burger, with onion rings and she really liked it. I got the Watermelon water -- oh my! You have to get this.  Next time, I am coming for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  Delicious. I have eaten here for dinner and breakfast.  It will become a regular place for me when I am in Phoenix.  You do need to get past the neighborhood and the homeless panhandling on the parking lot.  The place is basic.  Very clean and very plain.  If you come for the food, you will be very happy."}
{"text":"The FOOD was really good and the  service was GREAT!! Thanks Cruz for taking care of myself and my co-workers during our mid day lunch:) we will be returning."}
{"text":"Very friendly and courteous staff. We came in on a Saturday afternoon after reading reviews. We were seated right away and they have plenty of seating with an extra room for meetings, etc.    They offer American, Mexican and Asian food which was fun because we could order a variety without changing restaurants   I ordered the Kung Pao chicken. The portion size was adequate with plenty of chicken. The sauce was good, not too much but enough to cover the chicken.  There is a charge for fried rice in place of white but it is worth it. The fried rice is delicious.  The other two in our party ordered the monster burger and both liked the taste and size of the burger. French fries were good for one burger and a salad was substituted for the other side with the other burger. Nothing fancy just lettuce, tomato, cucumber and onion. They only have three dressings; ranch, honey mustard and balsamic.  I especially appreciated the music selection. You don't hear modern Christian music in an establishment very often.    The manager came around to check on our orders and Jose was very attentive without being intrusive.  When I'm in the area again I'd love to try one of their Mexican selections as well"}
{"text":"7/10/15: My co-workers & I had a great lunch here. This wasn't our first time and it won't be our last. The staff is very friendly and the food is excellent. The wait time isn't bad at all. It's nice to go somewhere, eat good food and still have plenty of time to chit chat before we head back to work. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just ate a very satisfying break fast . I had the huevos Ranchero and found it authentic and filling as it shuld be . I also got a side of very tasty onion rings . Wow could not have enjoyed more . The service is great and the place is clean and neat . Pricing is inexpensive which doesn't mean the quality isn't there. It's just a very good value."}
{"text":"My colleagues thought the place was a little suspect at first.... but they're now true believers. Collectively we got a burrito, Hawaiian fire chicken bowl, and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was great. Delicious food with hearty portions. We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I thought it would be pretty neat to try out IHOF since we are a family of 4 and we all have different tastes of what we wanted to eat for that night. Plus Yelp has many good reviewed. So we pull up, this is our first time here and I was excited. There was only one other family in the restaurant and were immediately greeted by our server Cruz, she was very friendly. I ordered the huaraches, my husband ordered the orange chicken and my kids ordered a meat lovers breakfast and bean and cheese tostadas. We also ordered 4 of the fresh juice drinks. The food came out and I would say it was a nice portion of food. Although the food was not great. It was good but not great. The orange chicken felt like it was straight out of a frozen bag. The huaraches were ok, a little bland in flavor I had to dump a bunch of sauce on it to taste something and it felt as though the beans were dry but a plus was that the carne asada was soft. I didn't get to try out the bean tostadas but my daughter seemed to enjoy them. I did try out the pancakes which those were good. Overall I don't think I will be back, to me $55 was way to expensive. We like to eat out and we have eaten at plenty of other restaurants for less than that."}
{"text":"Nice people, yummy food, easy parking. Beats CityScape crowds head and shoulders. Had the monster burger cooked perfectly. Fast service, very clean. We'll be back for other workday lunches for sure! And they deliver when you can't get out of the office."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to eat. We come in all the time and have never ever had a bad experience. The waiters and waitresses there are always in a very good mood and Cruz almost always helps us out and she deserves more than 5 stars. The food is delicious and the prices are great. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is around the area."}
{"text":"We love this place for quick and good lunch! Cruz is the best server ever, she's quick, helpful and attentive. Variety of food, everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant based on ratings. The exterior is not like your typical restaurant, and is pretty small. Once inside, the I found it to be very family friendly and the servers and cooks are very kind. I was in the mood for Chinese, and ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. Soo good! I cut the pieces of crispy chicken with one stroke with my fork. They were juicy and so fresh. The sauce is very good- and the rice was delicious. I will be coming here more often, and plan to bring kids- I can order Chinese for me and burgers for them! The only thing, is it closes by six- So plan to go before then."}
{"text":"Ordered the tostadas and pineapple juice, my friend ordered the crispy chicken salad. We both agreed that everything tasted great and the tostadas were definitely home made quality! I'm very picky about eating Mexican food out and I will definitely be coming back for those tostadas. They were delicious! Also the pineapple juice was perfect."}
{"text":"Love their fruit waters so yummy and delicious. I would come just for that 2.99 and u get it in a big cup yum. The food is good I've had the French toast and Kung pao both were delicious. Servers were good and friendly. A definitely good place to get food for decent if not great price"}
{"text":"The place had a great rating on Yelp so we decided to try it since we were nearby. I couldn't get out of there fast enough... However, the service was great and the prices were cheap. The other clientele gave me the creeps. I'm pretty sure the guy behind me literally pooped his pants while we were there. The tables were dirty as well. I ordered the Monster Burger for $9. The fries were good but the patties were clearly made from frozen and there was practically no bacon on it. It is what it is but I won't be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem- clean, friendly, and fairly priced, I would return for breakfast without reservation."}
{"text":"A great meal and super service. Jose was our waiter and he did an outstanding job taking care of us.   My wife and I tried several things on the menu and all were fantastic. I had the Hawaiian Fire Chicken with Fried Rice, my wife had a Asian Spicy Chicken Salad. Both were really good and we would get them again. We also shared three street tacos (asada and pastor) and those were good as well.  To drink we had the Pineapple and Strawberry fruit water. They were good but not as sweet as I'm used to and they were a bit watery.  The menu is huge and there is something for everyone.  Highly recommend this place and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Cruz and the rest of the staff are awesome and the best. Found this gem sometime last year and never looked back. Great food, staff, prices.... Trifecta!  BTW.... The pancakes are GREAT!"}
{"text":"Seriously...I have told everyone who will listen how amazing this place is. Like a dummy, I thought that I wanted Chinese food on Saturday night, only to walk into a local Chinese place packed to the brim because it was Chinese New Year. Oops. Turned around and left. We got in the car and pulled up yelp when IHOF popped up. Thought, \"what the hell\" and decided to take a chance. BEST.DECISION.EVER.  When we pulled into the parking lot around 7pm, there was only one other car there. We went inside and were greeted by Jose right away. He told us to have a seat anywhere we wanted and brought us a couple menus and drinks. When he came back, I asked what he recommended and he had something for each section of the menu. Like I said, I had a Chinese craving but when I am presented with Mexican food, that's what I always end up ordering. I ordered the Carne Asada Fries (I know...not the most authentic thing on the menu but it sounded really good) with a side of beans and rice. My lovely date had the Huaraches - half carne aside, half abobada.   Carne Asada Fries....these fries were perfectly seasoned and were crisp the whole time. They were still fluffy on the inside, not dried out from over frying. The meat was delicious and there was a lot of it...topped with cheese, jalapeños, sour cream, and guacamole. Hot sauce on the side. It was so good. The serving was huge and I ate just about all of it. The Huaraches are a signature dish...two gorditas stuffed with beans, topped with red and green sauce meat of your choice, onion, cilantro, cojita cheese. I had one bite....also delicious!  As we were waiting for our food, another family came in and ordered Chinese food. Although my food was awesome, as soon as theirs came out I instantly regretted my decision. Should have gone with my gut, but that's what multiple visits are for. In fact, as I sit writing this I am defrosting chicken to make for dinner tonight but I am going to throw it back in the fridge and go back to IHOF tonight. Bye!   **Oh sorry, I need to add, the dining area is super clean and when we paid we checked out the kitchen and that is equally as clean, yet very small. Great job IHOF!"}
{"text":"A couple of co-workers and I were looking for a new place to eat during our lunch break, so we decided to stop in at a small restaurant on Van Buren & 9th Ave named International House of Food. So glad we did, it's a great place. They have now moved to a larger location on Van Buren & 15th Ave. Love it even more! Very nice and clean and all the food is great, whether American, Mexican or Chinese. Drinks are just a tasty. Quick service and the staff is very attentive.  You want a tasty meal then stop in at IHOF! Tali, thank you for your great service today!   One happy customer, Maricela A."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Mexican, American and Chinese food perfect for my family!! The service is good and so is the food! I'll definitely come back here when I'm back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! 6 of us went and I got Yo try everything. I especially LOVED the watermelon juice. You need to try it. The pancakes, chorizo, tortillas, porkchop, burrito, and tacos were all very good! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie - I've driven by this place for years and wondered how tasty any food served out of this unassuming little building could be.  Let me now fess up and admit it's good.  REAL good.  The orange chicken/fried rice combo I'm stuffing my face with at the moment is delicious.  The service and prep was fast (under 10 minutes from ordering to delivery) and Jessica (one of the two servers that are currently busting out a lunch crowd) was personable and polite.  I usually bring a lunch to work, but next time I forget it I'll be sure to head on back here!"}
{"text":"This meal was absolutely inedible. The 'chile relleno' was about the size of a deck of cards and completely disgusting. There was a solid brick of some white cheese in the middle of a cold, lifeless 'relleno' that was coated in sawdust. This delight was topped with a watery, nasty red sauce. The 'beans and rice' that this $10 meal comes with are hard, grainy pieces of rice with beans so watery they could pass for bean soup. Everything was ice cold. After calling the restaurant and speaking with 'Jose,' he reiterated several times that they were 'unaware that their food went out that way.' When I said 'Don't you prepare the actual food?' He did not have a response. Worst $10 I ever spent... strongly advise you if you seek good, quality food that is prepared fairly according to menu description and delivered hot - seek it elsewhere."}
{"text":"The chinese food was okay. The low mein wasn't that great, but the veggie spring roll was good."}
{"text":"I got to give this place 5 stars just solely on the customer service provided by our server Michelle. She was very talkative and nice with me and my girl and our 8 month old daughter. She explained the menu to us and changed things up for us when we didn't like something. I had the cheese enchiladas which came with 6 small enchiladas and rice and beans. Michelle switched up the beans to peruano beans for me which was their vegetarian alternative to the refried beans that come with lard that they tend to serve with all their dishes. I guess the food was alright. I just wish it came in a bigger portion. I kind of felt like I was eating a kids meal. I left hungry and I didn't like how there was barely any cheese in the enchiladas. I did like their churros with ice cream and whip cream, it came with 4 hot and fresh churros. I guess next time I'll try a different dish that comes with more food. I'll give this place another chance just cause of how great Michelle was. She deserves a raise or a management position. If you want a clean restaurant with excellent customer service and don't want to get full then this is the spot for you. Honestly it is worth coming here just for the service alone. It kind of makes up for the small portion of food that they give you."}
{"text":"awesome staff and service........go check them out you will not be sorry.......jose......and the rest.   thanks bunches"}
{"text":"Ordered several party trays of food for a work lunch and got a ton of compliments. IHF was recommended to me by a couple coworkers who go regularly for lunch and breakfast. At first I was thrown off by the menu (tacos and Kung Pao chicken...ok!) but it was a huge hit!  Plus, huge bonus points for amazingly kind and sweet staff. I love seeing people happy in their work and proud of their business - I could tell that Juan (manager) really is. Definitely consider making a trip over or order delivery!"}
{"text":"The people were great, but the smelly homeless interlopers and the really bland, tasteless food kinda ruined it. Also, pretty overpriced for overly breaded, bad Chinese food"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and the food and service were top notch. I'm pretty every server came by at least once to ask if we needed anything. Super nice staff. The enchiladas and eggs were good and the bacon, eggs, sausage, and hash browns are also really. Overall a must go to place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"Great wholesome family place. The surrounding area might seem sketchy but it's a good place go to eat for all your cravings. Great atmosphere great staff great food."}
{"text":"Have gotten food from here twice now. They recently moved locations. They are now located two blocks down on Van Buren from where they were originally located.   The new location is much bigger and it definitely looks like the have plans to expand. However, the food here is pretty average, hence the 3 stars. People definitely hype this place up, but personally the only thing to hype up is that they have Mexican, Japanese, and American food. That is pretty neat, but I feel like this is something that would be better late night after having hit the bars.   Also, I might change the stars on the review after I've tried their breakfast, which is apparently their main course. It's available all day, so maybe I've been the dumb one for not trying it!"}
{"text":"First time here. After seeing many positive reviews here on YELP, we decided to try it. First impression  was of a very clean, neatly kept eatery. The combination of different genres  of food was appealing...something to please everyone. American, Mexican, Asian...even Vegetarian.  I ordered  the Sweet & Sour Chicken...the sauce was yummy , the chicken was breaded to perfection, onions, peppers, pineapple was fresh and crisp. Overall a nice place at reasonable  prices. I recommend giving  it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Jose our server was on point. The food was good and place was clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Phoenix for the weekend and wanted home made food, not franchised food. The meat lovers breakfast was delicious and plentiful, according to my husband. I had the huaraches, which is basically a flat, fried gordita covered in beans, asada, onions and cilantro--it was awesome! The pineapple water was fresh and scrumptious. The staff Juan and Sarah were so friendly and they definitely take pride in this place. Try it and be pleased."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch downtown. Service was great (Jose) and my pork chop and eggs hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Yum! First time here and really enjoyed it! Pleasant staff. Stephanie was great! Fresh fruit water. Pictured is watermelon & pineapple. So amazingly great!! Will be back many times! They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day and have a very large menu option!"}
{"text":"IHOF.  The acronym just sounds too cheesy, too ripe for mockery, too easily dismissed as a lazy knockoff of IHOP (International House of Pancakes for those living under a rock).  And indeed if you were to drive by this old and not necessarily attractive looking building on 9th Avenue and Van Buren, you might well expect that your deepest suspicions about this concept would undoubtedly be confirmed.  And yet, with glowing reviews from the Phoenix New Times and lots of early Yelper buzz, it would seem there's more to IHOF's story than it's cover.  Hungry for a hearty breakfast early on a Saturday morning, IHOF's 6am opening time is a rare Downtown Phoenix commodity on the weekend.  So it was off to IHOF for my latest culinary exploration.  What the exterior lacks in charm, the comfortable, clean, and pleasantly outfitted interior more than makes up for.  The interior restaurant offers seating for upwards of 50 inside.  There's also  shaded patio seating along Van Buren outside for at least 10 more (a quick note: if you sit outside you'll be hit with the smell of bread consistently due to being located downwind from the local Bimbo bakery right next door).  The interior includes a beautifully painted mural on the wall and even some fun handmade centerpieces at each table.  I grabbed a seat in the corner and the friendly waitress (didn't catch her name) took care of me this morning.  As other descriptions of this place suggest, its a wide mix of foods here.  American, Mexican, and Chinese dishes can all be found on the menu.  The breakfast menu specifically is limited to just traditional American and Mexican breakfast fare.  For my breakfast this go around I decided on an American breakfast with a Mexican drink.  My drink was a licuado de platano (or a banana milkshake).  Came in a GIANT glass and was topped with a healthy chunk of cinnamon on top.  Really awesome drink I must say.  I recommend stirring the cinnamon around a bit to get an even dispersal, but a nice light smooth and refreshing concoction for any time of the day.  For my breakfast itself, I went with the Big Combo.  Two eggs (scrambled with cheese in my case), two bacon, two sausage links, two pancakes, and hash browns.  Simple, straight forward American breakfast.  I was particularly happy with the amount of cheese they gave me with my eggs, and the sausage was tasty too.  Kind of wished the pancakes were a little bigger, but the overall portion was plenty to satisfy me.  Overall, a solid breakfast.  Total for the breakfast, drink, tax and tip came to about $15.  Good value and good portions and the waitress was very attentive and friendly from the get go.  The breakfast itself didn't knock my socks off, but the licuado was fantastic.  I'd drink that anytime any day.  Across the board, the menu here at IHOF is super affordable with every item being $10 or less.  You can also order large party trays of many of the items they serve on their everyday menu.  So okay, the IHOF name might lack creativity or originality.  But as long as their friendly staff can whip up a tasty inexpensive meal every time I visit, I promise I'll keep the snarky comments to myself."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out... Was not disappointed. The menu is a mix of breakfast, asian, and Mexican foods. The huaraches with el pastor were great, and I washed it down with a Hawaiian sunrise. Place is ridiculously clean too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I say four stars and not five because this was only my first time and, well, who knows if I missed something? But thus far, great staff, quiet, simple surroundings, fun selection of things to try, and the food was good.  I had the vegetarian lo mein, for which I thought there'd be a rice noodle option according to the website, but I guess not? Boyfriend had the steak omelette and said it was pretty good. Fair portions, fair price, and the pineapple water I had while I waited (a very short time) was fantastic.  Excited to go again someday."}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered the combo breakfast and a cup off coffee. Everything was really good, pricing was spot on. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent little place for all kind variety of food ! We had breakfast and it's pretty delicious and fresh ! Good service and great smile , that's important too :) oh don't forget to try their watermelon water !!! So refreshing !!! Glad I got one to go !"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't left a review yet! I have been coming here about a year. It's a wonderful family owned restaurant and I've never ordered something I didn't love. They have vegetarian options and the breakfast burritos are the very best. I'm totally addicted really. The family and staff are so friendly and appreciative. You will love this place!"}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast. Very clean, very friendly staff, delicious food, very inexpensive (crappy Dennys usually costs us thirty dollars or so) and nice quiet atmosphere. Nothing very flashy for breakfast, but that suits my hubby just fine. One awesome thing I must suggest however is the fruit waters. Normally I love my coffee with breakfast but I was intrigued, so of course I had to try. Delish! I got onshore which came out as a little ready of sunshine with an umbrella in it. Didn't miss my coffee at all. Definitely a great morning stop especially if you are sick of the. Restaurants that get high ratings because they are trendy (been to way too many disappointments that way) I think the only down side is there really isn't much decor and from the outside it is not eye catching, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Excellent service. Haven't had anything I didn't like. Great place. Cruz gives great service!!!"}
{"text":"Per usual, IHOF has made me a delicious plate of Kung Pao chicken extra crispy.  I have been eating here since it opened at the other location and they make delicious tacos, Chinese food and some of the best pancakes.  It's nice that they moved even closer to my work at a state building.  A great option ESP now that's in walking distance."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delightful. Cruz and sylvia were great! Food was delicious and quick. Carneasada fries, breakfast burrito and quesadilla. Next time were coming for Chinese"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here. Cruz was our server today and last time, we had excellent service and excellent food. This is one of my favorite places to eat! I will recommend this place to my friends that live in arizona!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken with the peanuts - Kung pao. Was very tasty. Chicken was nicely cooked, with perfect chillis and nice fresh broccoli. The only thing - they don't have chopsticks and their chili souce is a bit sour than hot.  Good service. And no deserts."}
{"text":"They give you a lot of food which was nice for the price. the trick here is that I called my food in so I can eat right away."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, reasonable prices and great variety. We were plenty surprised by this one. Looking forward to coming back Plus it's a local family owed business!!"}
{"text":"We went here because they had great reviews. I'm very confused about our experience as opposed to the reviews on here. Our table ordered chips with salsa and guac, a burger and chicken fingers. The fries were pretty good. The guac was a plastic container with what looked like green mayo in it. The person who ordered chicken fingers couldn't even eat them. The server seemed very confused when I asked for a plain cheeseburger. I had to explain what plain meant, meat cheese and bun. The food was a fairly normal pricing- about 11bucks for a meal. I heard they recently moved locations, and I don't know how long ago that was because it almost looks like a fake restaurant. It looks kind of unfinished. I'm still very confused. I'm giving it 2 stars though because the server was still nice."}
{"text":"Food was fresh done in a measurable amount of time the employees were friendly the food was hot we were the only people in the building because it was late but we defenitly liked our experience there waitress was very attentive and it's a good place to get a mixture of foods u like you could have a cheeseburger and fried rice I defenitly will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place and new location. Friendly family owned local business.  Good variety of food - breakfast, sandwiches, salads, burgers, Chinese and Mexican food. Love their Agua Frescas!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday, but finally decided to go in a few weeks ago.  And it was delicious.  I got the veggie burrito and hashbrowns. The burrito was steaming hot and full of many different vegetables.   It was very cheap, less than what I would have paid for the same amount of food at a chain.  The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price and an added bonus the music they play is Christian"}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat been here two times now and it's so so awesome and great food I will keep coming back to eat here so I might be here tomorrow for tacos Tuesday yummmy just got done eating here again we got the tacos this time very delicious and yummy and Cruz is so very awesome too she gets her work done too"}
{"text":"I love the variety of this place AND it delivers seriously what can be better than that? Driver was completely friendly and food was nice n warm when arrived best choice for lazy days"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! A great lunch spot. I love the new location. April my server was great!"}
{"text":"The second i walked in I felt welcomed by the waiters. They approached us in a way that made me feel comfortable and the service was amazing. The food didn't take long to make and came out fresh and delicious. I never usually finish food but at this place, I scrapped off the food and finished it completely. This is a place that I would definitely come to again and again. But again, the service is phenomenal and the food is amazing at a cheap price!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying IHOF and I was absolutely blown away. First off, Jose was very nice and had excellent customer service he made great suggestions and never denied any of my request like adding a fried egg to my bacon cheeseburger. Jose suggested an Agua Fresca and I went with the strawberry flavor and I was surprised to see him making it hand made with a blender behind me. I was so impressed with the flavors of the food and beverage. I will definitely be back to support this local family owned food spot!"}
{"text":"We followed the reviews here and was satisfied. Great breakfast food, and Jose was really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Huge selection unique items and now many vegetarian options.   Mexican, Chinese, a Thai dish, and dinner (american food including breakfast items) they have it.  On my first visit I oped for the daily special which was a chillie rellno and a drink for $6.99 The chillie it self was quite good, the sides were standard and the hand made soft corn tortilla were amazing.   My coworker had a dish we had never seen before, potato gortia like long patties covered in sauce cheese and chunk of carne asada. ~7.50 which he did enjoy.  My one grip with this place is the price. With tax and tip meals are close to $10 and I would like it to be just a buck or so less for lunch pricing or have a pei wei like format so I did not need to tip."}
{"text":"I came upon this place with my daughter one morning passing by, when they first opened up.  Since then I have brought multiple co workers here and they have all done the same. Good food at a great price.  I hope they stay around for awhile and expand to other locations!"}
{"text":"I've tried several things off the menu and they have all been really good.  I do have to say though my top 2 are the Honey chicken (delishhh) and the other is the Mexican enchiladas (very good).  Great place, attentive & friendly.  Little hidden gem. :)"}
{"text":"Matt's Big Breakfast was super busy this weekend before Christmas so I turned to yelp trying to find something good that I haven't had before and this place popped up and decided to give it a try for breakfast.  It's located right next to the Bimbo bread factory when I got out of the car it smelt like fresh baked goodness.  Going inside the decor was what I expected for a Chinese American Mexican restaurant. Service was rather friendly, but that's where all things good end. We ordered a waffle combo and biscuits and gravy. I should have thought twice about ordering food after constantly hearing the microwave alarm sound. The food was lame, not bad, but really disappointing. Maybe something you'd expect at a truck stop diner. Throughout our meal I probably heard the microwave alarm go off about 20 times even though there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I was baffled.  On the way out I got what they called a pineapple fruit water, which really is a Mexican agua de piña. It was well done, fresh made and quite delicious. If I'm going to go back I would give the Mexican food a try, although I wouldn't be surprised if it is just microwave cuisine."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to come here for a long time. Worked out that today was the day. Came for late lunch, not crowded, some were having breakfast, some Chinese, some the daily salad special, and for me, Mexican. Service was very friendly, helpful and attentive. The fruit water was suggested, the watermelon version was delicious. Enchiladas were different than the typical, with just chicken inside, a green tomatillo sauce, and lots of lettuce dusted with cheese. Good beans and rice on the side. I'll be back, for Chinese and breakfast!"}
{"text":"Such a random place but the food and the staff are amazing. You can get breakfast of waffles, eggs, and sausage or you can order authentic Mexican food or delicious Chinese. It is definitely a hidden gem. Today I tried the orange chicken with the fried rice and a spring roll. The orange chicken was mild just the way I like it.  For dessert I tried the fried churros with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. All I could say is OMG! It was AMAZING! The churros were hot and crunchy with a vanilla cream filling. Wish I could come back but I'm just visiting from Chicago. Just wanted to leave the restaurant and staff a well deserved, pleasant review."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start it's clean, great staff Dally was awesome, good food, great prices one of the best places I've ate in Phoenix we'll definitely be back again super awesome atmosphere worship all the time"}
{"text":"Service was top notch and the food hit the spot. The owner was very kind and clearly values her staff. Our server was fun and helpful. There are a ton of choices on the menu, so it's great if you are looking for variety. I had the enchiladas and thought they were great!"}
{"text":"Service was great, our waitress was Cruz. My wife and I enjoyed our visit, she had the enchiladas while I had the huraches. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Totally stumbled upon this place while looking for breakfast spots downtown and decided to give it a try!! Cruz was our server and greeted us right away, she was so sweet!!! Our food came out super fast and the service was phenomenal!!! I love the easy parking and I love supporting family run businesses! Definitely stop by if you're looking for a good meal with good service in a clean environment!!!!! Way to go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled.  Don't be fooled by what appears from the outside to be a  hole in the wall.  Authentic fare, excellent prices, and good service is what you will find inside this hidden gem.  International House of Food is a no frills restaurant but it is squeeky clean and serves tasty dishes.  The owners work the counter and they are gracious and welcoming.  International House of food serves Breakfast, Chinese, and Mexican entrees it might sound like an odd collection of food but somehow it works. I was impressed with the Al pastor tacos. The meat was tender and flavorful and the tacos had a nice taste.  I have also tried many items on the breakfast menu such as a pancakes, french toast, eggs, and fried potatoes and all were very tadty. However, I think one of my favorites is a club sandwich with onion rings.   Great service, competitive pricing, and tasty food, it doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch or dinner if you have a picky family, they have a little of everything. Had the Mongolian food it was good."}
{"text":"Needed a place to eat before the Suns game that wasn't too close to the arena that it would be packed, but wasn't far. Found IHOF, saw the reviews and the eclectic menu so we decided to try it. I can't say I've had Chinese food with a side of chicken and waffles before, but it works. Our waitress Michelle was super friendly the whole night. We'll definitely be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had tacos.  He had carne asada and I had al pastor. Let me tell you these are the best al pastor tacos here in Phoenix. Also their fruit waters are refreshing and delicious"}
{"text":"Elizabeth was very professional and kind great service and great food I'm from Oc California and if I'm ever in town again diff gonna stop by here again"}
{"text":"If you are felling like you can't make up your mind, this is the place to go! We had amazing lettuce wraps with some tacos dorados and huaraches. It was delicious, the servings were huge and the service fast and friendly"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix! First off, impeccable service! Our server was Dalli and she was fantastic and informative about the food. We came here seeking Chinese but the Mexican menu was too tempting to pass up. The chicken enchiladas were 5-star and I added fried eggs on top which I highly recommend. Chips AND salsa are made fresh and chips are served hot. My dining companion had street tacos of various kinds and all three were delicious! Served with traditional style beans and rice - the beans are SO good! Loved the rice too! This is nice light Mexican fare - no gut bombs!  We saw the burgers delivered to a nearby table and they looked great too! Can't wait to return and try Chinese and breakfast items!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Wonderful service from Elizabeth. The restaurant is clean and tidy. Staff is friendly. Waffles and eggs were just right, coffee was good and the strawberry water was Awesome!!! Totally coming back here regularly!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  Ordered the chicken quesadilla the first time, was the best I have tasted in a long time. Ordered the waffle and scramble egg platter the second time, on a Wed afternoon!!! Waffles light and fluffy. AWESOME!!!! Going back to try the pineapple chicken with rice bowl. Clean, fast service, music was awesome and great customer service. FINALLY a  GREAT diner in downtown Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food & great service. IHOF is a unique restaurant, serving American, Mexican, and Chinese food. They also had vegetarian options! I definitely recommend it (:"}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere.  They have wide selections and healthy food.  I got a healthy breakfast burrito with a side unique sauce that was exceptionally good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Truly I did.  I went once for lunch and was tickled to find carne asada fries on the menu. I'm from California so this was a little treat for me.  The best part was the fries by far. The carne asada was rubbery, the guacamole bland, the whole ensemble wasn't worth it's original components.   \"Well, it's not a item that usually highlights a restaurant's cuisine\" I said. So I tried again.  This time I ordered a carne asada burrito and some al pastor street tacos. Again I was disappointed. I ordered the burrito with cheese and pico de gallo. The tortilla was cold and bland. Again the carne asada was uninspiring. The cheese that was added was cold, shredded  that had been sloppily sprinkled on.   The tacos were good. Plenty of meat and onions. Good, quality tacos.  I might come again just because of the proximity to work and try something on the Chinese portion of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday and this place has an exceptional service. The food came up pretty quickly. The staff and our waiter, Jose were so hospitable and attentive. We will definitely come here again when we're in town."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I got the huaraches and it was fantastic. The kung pao is really good too and the service was great. Shoutout to my waiter Jose, He was great"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, pineapple water highly recommended!  Parking spaces are a bit strange out front.. I would avoid parking in the middle entirely."}
{"text":"Recently catered from here for about 40 people, & Juan took really good care of us. We came from out of town (CA) for a week long ballet festival at the Phoenix Convention Center. We had their Chinese food & everything was fresh & tasty. A big hit amongst our group! I was so pleased that I ordered their catering for a 2nd night & decided to try their Mexican food as well. An ample amount of food at a very reasonable price. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, was that to me, the food was not as authentic as you could get from a more ethnically focused restaurant. I'm a Chinese lady from Southern CA, who knows what authentic Chinese & authentic Mexican food is like. But I figure that for catering purposes, dishes needed to be adjusted for being able to feed the masses. The Chinese food was comparable to what you would get at a Panda Express, not from Chinatown. And the Mexican food was not like any Mexican I had ever had before (except the rice & beans were pretty standard). But all that to say, everything was still very tasty & satisfied our hungry dancers to a T."}
{"text":"IHOF not to be confused with IHOP  This place is great, lots of food to choice from, American, Chinese, Mexican and more. I will have go back again and try something also, today bit my wife and I had breakfast. She got the French toast combo and I got chicken and waffles. Both were very good. This place needs some decor bad, just a bunch of blank walls but very clean and great wait staff."}
{"text":"Great food. I have the Hawaiian fire chicken and it was perfect. Just the right amount of heat. Definitely upgrade to the fried rice, it was fantastic.  My wife had the enchiladas and she loved them. The Green salsa was fantastic"}
{"text":"First time here, saw them on yelp. Food was great & so was the service. Cruz was very friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"This place is deceivingly good.  Great tasting food.  I ordered the fire chicken and spring roll.  Granted the spring roll was a little smaller than expected but it was delicious.  The angus Fresca was super fresh and delicious too. I would definitely come back if I am in the neighborhood.  Thanks Rosa!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly service and a great variety!! Also the place is clean and prompt. I would Love to come back to try the lunch and dinner options (which were available a lunch time also!!)"}
{"text":"Today is super cold and rainy and my friend and I did not want to venture outside of work for lunch but the reviews for this place were too good to ignore. The inside is small and kind of crowded with tables but very clean. It's very casual so you can just pick a seat if you are dining in or you can go to the register for take out. We were greeted before we even sat down and ordered drinks right away, they were back in no time and we ordered our food. I got the chicken lo mein and a spring roll and she had the orange chicken and friend rice on the side. Both came surprisingly fast, which is perfect because we only had about 30 min to eat and get back to work. The noodles are home made and the veggies were fresh and not over cooked. I loved that the sauce wasn't overly sweet/salty or sticky like most places. My friends chicken and rice plate was enough to feed two! I couldnt resist stealing a few pieces of her chicken, great flavor and crispy. I'd say the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the tables are a little crowded and the noise of all the cooking going on was hard to keep a conversation at times, but we did sit right against the prep wall near the door to the outdoor patio. Next time, and there will be many, we will just sit outside or on he other side."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious and affordable but they play Christian Music and have signs that openly praise God. I eat there twice a week.  I love their chicken and waffles and Omelets. All their Omelets come with two pancakes too. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love the food and variety at IHoF. The location is in a bit of a sketchy area but I have never had a problem. They moved to a new location with a huge seating area. The restaurant is simple but very clean. The food is reasonable and good. It's nothing fancy, but perfect for lunch or to take home for dinner. The Mexican selection is where they shine but their American \"diner\" items are good too. I have not tried their Asian offerings. Parking is in a partially fenced in lot. There are a number of transients in the area but I have never had any issues with any of them. They also do catering and have a private dining room."}
{"text":"I was here with a group that took over the entire patio on a beautiful spring day for brunch.  They even had to bring out more chairs as our group grew to about 10. Most of us had breakfast, I had lunch and some had combinations of both. They supposedly don't do gluten free but the one in our party whom it mattered to they worked with to change some ingredients around.  This is not gourmet food.  But it is well cooked basic stuff, and easy on the pocket book. With a large group somebody is bound to have a food complaint, every plate was cleaned. All the staff we dealt with were pleasant.  So maybe the neighborhood is not where you would expect to find good food at a good price but I would not hesitate to go here again."}
{"text":"The chips all salsa were really good. But I didn't enjoy the main dish so much. Everything was blain and nothing seemed seasoned, very very slow and quiet inside so we expected quick service but it was very slow unfortunately considering we were one of two groups in the restaurant. They have a great idea as far as the menu. Just needs some work in the kitchen and service."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming along with my boyfriend, we were both craving different things and it worked out so great, perfect timing and our service was outstanding! Thank you to our server Patty, she was so sweet and made it a great experience! Food was so delicious! I got Mongolian beef, my bf got a burrito, both really good! We'll be returning customers!"}
{"text":"The food and service was great here. Got the steak omelette and the pineapple drink. Everything was brought out very quickly and I couldn't have gotten better service from the waitress Stephany. I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for years. It is hard to please my Asian boyfriend when not at a traditional Asian restaurant. He played it safe and ordered chicken fried rice and it got his deal of approval. I had the Hawaiian Fire chicken bowl with fried rice and two of the spring rolls. The chicken was thoroughly coated with sauce, crunchy and the inside was fresh, light, and tender. The spring rolls were very tasty. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place to eat at. The owners and staff are very friendly, once you walk in they greet you right away and take you to your seat. My favorite thing to eat here are the enchiladas, and the vegetarian burrito. I'm ganna try more stuff From the menu and I'm sure it's delicious. Can't wait to go back. You never see a clean restaurant like this one. Great job on the new location. It's big and very comfortable to eat at."}
{"text":"Great place, tons of options. Good food and good service by Jose! The watermelon drink is on point!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and speedy service! The food was delicious, we got the carne asada huaraches and chicken street tacos, both so good. Kids shared an order of carne asada fries with the jalapeños on the side, which they liked as well. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Orange chicken and fried rice. Tried watermelon water and it was great! Jessica was an awesome server, very attentive and sweet."}
{"text":"New location! Simple, unfussy breakfast fare, served all day. The staff is super friendly, and even the cook came out to check on us.  Server Cruz made sure we had everything we need."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great environment wonderful service and the food is delicious. Great staff Cruz always takes care of us"}
{"text":"Just moved to new location at 15th Avenue and Van Buren and the joint rocks. Server Michelle is wonderful.  Daily specials.  I thought the idea of a menu with American, Chinese, and Nexicsn was odd but the choices work."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great selection of Mexican, American, and Chinese food. The menu was huge and everything was delicious! Staff was so friendly and accommodating.  Perfect for a large group- lots of space for and something for everyone's taste.  Restaurant was squeaky clean too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to the hotel I was staying at and it had good Yelp reviews so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Huaraches with carne asada. I had never had huaraches before so I wasn't sure what to expect. From the very first bite I was in love. They were sooooo good I ate the entire thing... I left nothing on my plate. The customer service was also great. Don't let the harsh exterior deter you. If I'm ever back in Phoenix, I will come back to this place"}
{"text":"Working at downtown it can be challenging to find a good lunch place. IHOF I just that! Thanks to Michelle for her friendly service :)"}
{"text":"The food at IHOF is pretty standard. Good, but not necessarily worth coming for. However, the options and the combinations you can get make it all worth it.   Last time I went, I was starving and feeling a lot of different cravings. I ended up getting a side of hashbrowns and the Hawaiian fire chicken. Not a combo you can get anywhere else that I'm aware of, and the waitress was kind enough not to give me a weird look. The hashbrowns weren't  crispy, but it hit the spot. The fire chicken had a nice flavor, but it was nothing special. My s/o got something off the Mexican portion of the menu, which he really enjoyed. We also saw these ladies get salads that were HUGE and very intriguing.   The place is large and clean, and tables are nicely spaced out. It seemed like quite a number of people were there with coworkers, some even seemed to be in a lunch meeting. The service was also pretty fast--i was able to get in and out in about 35 minutes. They also have a private parking lot with ample spaces.    Definitely a good place to go if you're in a larger group and want everybody to be happy! Plus, breakfast is served all day :)"}
{"text":"This is a very nice, clean place. My husband and I stopped by here late one Saturday morning. It's amazing what they offer. Can't really call them an IHOP or Denny's since they also serve a more authentic selection of Mexican food. Asked the waiter if everything on the menu is up for grabs at whatever time of the day, and his response was, \"yes\". Hooray!!! American, Chinese, Mexican. Breakfast items as well. Yummy! My husband had a meat and veggie loaded omelet and loved it. I had pancakes, poached eggs, fruit, and sausage. Pancakes left something to be desired. Tasted store bought but okay. Wish they could spice the pancakes up a bit with diff toppings or flavors. Friendly staff and good cheap food. Will def come again to check out their Chinese and Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"What a gem!  Strange looking little spot on the edge of Phoenix downtown... doesn't look like much, but it's clean as a whistle and very well cared for. The food is great and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I had migas con chorizo and she had the bacon and eggs breakfast. The waffle was a little more like a pancake than a waffle but tastes fine and the eggs, chorizo, cheese and tortillas were really good.  It's at the corner of Van Buren and 9th Ave and I can honestly you should check this place out. For us it's likely to become our regular breakfast spot here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I'm glad we tried it out. We got the watermelon and a pineapple fresca as recommended by Jose...literally the words that came out of my mouth was bomb-diggity. Glad I took his advice. How I regressed that far into history is unknown.  But it didn't stop there...the chicken hurachas and continental breakfast did not disappoint.  The sauce and the ground chicken were perfectly seasoned and the hurachas were delicious.  The eggs and biscuits were fluffy and full of flavor, while the hash browns were cooked just right...crispy and not burned. We will be back to try the Chinese...it smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Interesting menu options. I had Mexican, wife and son had Asian food. We were all very satisfied. Decor is uninspiring, that's ok though. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I will admit I drove by and judged a book by it's cover. The voices in my head were like a restaurant that serves American, Asian and Mexican how could they get it right? After countless passing's to and from work I noticed that the parking lot was not shy of customers. I then decided to take the daring approach and give them a try. All I can say is a major lesson has been learned. I have missed out on this hidden gem for a long time.   There motto is correct \"International House of Food, where the real flavor lives.\" I was raised on home cooked authentic food. So I know good food when I see and taste it. This family operated establishment offers a variety of genuine real home cooked meals. What is impressive is they can get it right now matter what cuisine you feel like. With breakfast, lunch and dinner served all day no matter who you dine with will be happy. To top it off the price point is reasonable. Better than some of the go to chain restaurants.   So let's get to the good stuff. I would like to start of by saying I have witness and experienced some of the best customer service. Each person who works there is happy. One big happy family that they make you feel apart of. All smiles and they never miss a beat. The restaurant is so organize on the process of great customer service it makes you not want to visit a big chain restaurant.  Your immediately greeted from the moment you step foot in the door. Feel free to seat yourself to a table that has the silverware on it. The menu caters to all taste buds and dietary needs including kids. In reviewing it you will see there are options for everyone. Their food is never pre-made. Cooked to order so it comes out hot and fresh. You see the cooks hard at work having fun in the kitchen while you wait for your food.  The most difficult part in dining here is to figure what your going to have as the tasty options make you want to order it all. I highly recommend as seen in the picture is to order a Fruit Water to help wash down your food. I have been hooked on the Watermelon Water since day one. Comes in what appears to be a Margarita Glass but trust me their is no liquor. It is garnished with a lovely piece of fruit.   I recently dined with a friend who wanted lettuce wraps and hash browns during lunch. It was nice she could have both breakfast and lunch at the same time.  There really has never been a disappointment moment I have experienced. If I could give more than \"5\" stars I would. I highly recommend you at least try this place once as I know you will be back.  Some Key Points:  They have a catering menu  If you don't like something in a dish tell them to keep it out. Everything is made to order. Plenty of Parking Long hours daily so you can come a couple times a day. lol Smaller restaurant but they have you in and out. I have never had to wait during lunch"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  This will become one of my standards in the Phoenix area.  Looking forward to sampling their entire menu."}
{"text":"This is a great quirky little restaurant. I usually stray away from places that have every kind of food under the sun, but this place is different. The food is always very fresh, hot and delicious. Everything is very clean. I get the feeling that the owners/management/staff really have their heart in it. Pretty quick too."}
{"text":"Always great! Love the new location lots of space! Same delicious food. Juan and his parent take great care of their business. We will be back and of course recommend to everyone. Ask for the Hot salsa."}
{"text":"Let's start as usual, with the customer service. Michelle (My waitress) was absolutely fabulous!! Very customer service oriented, professional and caring. The smile on her face was very contagious. She was attentive, and left me asking for Nada at all.   Food. I had the Migas con Chorizo, hash browns, (and even though it comes with tortillas, I requested to not be served any) the food was on point. Very fresh, very tasteful (I could have used a bit more spicyness but that's where adding hot salsa helped). The coffee was delicious, enough to drink black.   The atmosphere, super clean! Huge, spacious, and very inviting. I will definitely be coming back here to try more foods. And I will be more than proud to bring others to this incredibly quaint spot."}
{"text":"WhAt a menu and what a staff. The food is amazing here  !!  so steak omelette was stacked, if you are looking for high protein breakfast , that omelette is everything you need. The pancakes are made to perfection and their French toast so good . You will literally inhale their food . We will be back for lunch , dinner and then set it to repeat . Try this place out"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw the high reviews on yelp and was very curious.  How could one location make so many cuisines well to warrant a high rating?   Let me tell you, they do! I'm not sure who is in the kitchen but they are talented!  The food makes up for the lack of decor so pay no attention.  Will definitely be back when the husband and I disagree on what we want to eat.  IHOF makes us both happy!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Super clean restaurant! The fruit drinks were really good too!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We ordered the mexican dishes. The Huaraches with pastor was super tasty. The enchiladas were excellent too. Also really liked the watermelon aquas frescas.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"The place was clean, spacious and pleasant. The staff was super friendly and efficient. My waiter checked on us several times without prompting. The menu selection was great offering many items for breakfast lunch and dinner along with specials."}
{"text":"This place has come in handy in the area more than once. You can count on it for quick service and a decent meal."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican breakfast I had in a while!!! I love this place, it's my first time here and I am definitely coming back!!! I'm so happy I found them on yelp!!"}
{"text":"Elizabeth is awesome she is a great server and this place is always great and the food is amazing, anything you get is always perfect, fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. Whether breakfast, lunch or dinner, everything is always great. Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast,  so glad we did. Cruz was a wonderful  waitress. We ordered tons of foid and everything  was delish. The main reason we stopped in was  my husband loves breakfast burritos that have hashbrowns as the potato.  We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally attempted to try Ihof for the first time. Let me tell you the food was amazing. Hands down! The service was quick. Food came out within less than 20min. Don't let the area stop you from entering. Jose the server did s great job taking care of us, making sure we were okay, kept our tables clear everytime we finish a dish. The food was too good to even take the photo I picture in my head while trying all deliciousness. We order the steak omelet, rice and beans, French toast combo, chicken tender combo, biscuit and gravy and pancakes. All was extremely well cook perfectly crips. Food is very cheap and huge portions"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Basic place, but good food. Not too many quick good paces in tbevarea of the state Capitol. Will be back"}
{"text":"This place is great, the selection on the menu is astronomical but, does not take away from the quality everything they serve is fresh and savory. I would definitely become a regular here and most likely never run out of new meal choices. I will be back with the family to keep discovering many more delicious entrees."}
{"text":"I had the Tlocoyos. Pockets of masa stuffed with beans and topped with chili Verde and cojito cheese. Delicious.  Nice people, good prices. ¡Sabroso!"}
{"text":"Good food, great servce, very clean!  you can get everything - from mexican, to chinese, even philly cheese steak . . . they have a lot of variety on their menu.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem while participating in the #RedforEd movement. The beef and broccoli is pretty delicious, and the owner was super nice! They have a wide variety of food, with vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"We drove past this place many times before deciding to try it. I'm glad we did, the food was very good and our server was super friendly. I would recommend the fruit water."}
{"text":"Curaza was our waitress very nice person. The food was amazingly good. Great combination of dishes to pick from. I am very pleased on how clean this place is and even the bathrooms are very very clean. We will be coming back. We had the spring rolls which are so so good. I had the enchiladas they were okay needed a lil more flavor."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is unassuming from the outside, but the inside is super clean, the staff is so friendly and the food is amazing! We had carne asada huaraches, and a chorizo breakfast burrito. The hurraches were so flavorful and not something you can find anywhere. Highly recommend them. They also put hash browns in the breakfast burritos and that was delicious as well. We also had a strawberry and a watermelon fruit water. They are not overly sweet and very refreshing. Prices are great. I can't want to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, food is fresh and quick. Excellent service. Super convenient location with plenty parking available. My SO loves the Hawaii fire chicken plate, I get the vegetarian spring rolls as I am watching the waistline..will be coming back for more!  Agua Fresca de fresa is a must try.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. We got the Mongolian beef and kung pow chicken. The Mongolian was pretty good but the kung pow chicken was pretty dry, it could have used a lot more sauce."}
{"text":"Was staying in downtown phoenix, and didnt feel like driving or walking anywhere, so we just ordered in and it was a big choice or dishes. from mexican to chinese and american. good food!   AND THEY HAVE TACOS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I moved right down the street, and I thought it looked pretty weird at first. But, we went here and tried it and I'm in looove.  Everything I've had here is really, really good. And such good prices.  I think I need to get in here on a taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"So I've seen this place before and heard good things about it as well. To come here is a totally different thing. You'll notice that they're friendly, the food is fresh and they are just good people.  The building is not new and not 'trendy'. But it's very clean. They seem to be concerned with getting you a fresh, hot meal with a smile. You see the cooks at the grill making your food which is always nice. I would not hesitate to come back here."}
{"text":"Great! Had beef broccoli and kung pao chicken... both amazing! Place is clean and staff is behind wonderful!"}
{"text":"Nice people.  Our first time yesterday. The food was pretty good   Had Asian dishes.  Good service. A little far for us for this type of restaurant"}
{"text":"International House of. . .Food?  :)  IHOF.  Okay.  Despite the cheesy name, this joint is a big diner, but a snazzy one.  I decided to give things a go here with a big, old-fashioned breakfast.  You know what?  Pretty darned good!  My wife had a carne asada plate that she really liked also.  This place really is International, and they serve American, Mexican, and Chinese dishes.  From the many excellent reviews, I can tell that this is a popular spot for many people.  That list of people now includes me, and I'll certainly be stopping by again for maybe. . .a fried rice.  The Mexican food apparently has a signature green tomatillo sauce that I'm also itchin' to try, so I planning my return visits.  Haven't been here yet?  It's time.  You may not be able to decide what to eat at first--there's so many choices!"}
{"text":"A great little hidden gem of a restaurant. Super low key and relaxed vibes, a unique blend of delicious Mexican, Asian and American style food. My server Jose was prompt, friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be back each time I come to Phoenix. The tacos and General Tao chicken are fuego!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the waiters were friendly! Definitely glad that I decided to visit!"}
{"text":"Very nice place great food lots of varieties .Everything from American Breakfast Mexican Chinese Clean and great and friendly staff. The area is fine its seconds from downtown Phoenix and near the Capitol building"}
{"text":"Highly recommend .. The food is fantastic..  Cruz is a fantastic server... They have amazing food a great service... Hope you guys enjoy.."}
{"text":"First time  great service, very good food.  Sausage and bacon cooked to perfection.  Perfect portions. Looking forward to my next visit for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. The waitress was really friendly and helpful, the service was really nice. Haven't yet tasted the food yet, but looks pretty good from other tables."}
{"text":"For a 35 min no let me comp you took 20 min to say we ran out of rice.. Im eating for two and Im extremely upset..  Will never eat lunch here again"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! A friend recommended this place to us. I was a little skeptical due to the variety of the different types of food,  but pleasantly surprised; I got Chinese and so was my husband; who got Mexican."}
{"text":"Try their fruit infused water... It is delicious and not what you expect ;) mmmm! I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Good diner style breakfast.  Friendly staff.  Quick service.  Perfect for a quick work lunch!  Cruz was a great waitress.  Thanks! :D"}
{"text":"Found by chance and not disappointed... crispy chicken salad was good; chicken and dressing were great but not thrilled with the all iceberg lettuce... the pineapple water on the otherhand, was freakin' amazing!!!! :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant! I think it's the best service I've received anywhere in Phoenix. Janet was our server and super friendly and helpful, and everyone else working was also so very nice. I really liked the International Appetizer, which included egg rolls, chicken tenders, onion rings and french fries. It was hard to decide what to eat since everything on the menu looked so good and there's such an assorted genre of food to choose from. I will definitely be back! And they deliver within 3 miles of the restaurant, so it's good for a night in too."}
{"text":"WOW! I must confess, as other Yelper's have previously stated, I too was not so sure based on the outer appearance and the name BUT, do NOT let those things turn you off from the Friendliest, most Attentive (without being overbearing), and Warm customer service and the delicious menu!  We decided, after reading many Glowing reviews, to try it out today. Loved hearing our worship leader, BJ Putnam's song playing as we walked in the door! Cruz was our server and she was very patient with us while we were trying to decide what to order and then changing our minds. She was happy to answer our questions about various menu items too!  We ended up ordering burgers, Bacon Cheeseburger for me, and Guacamole Bacon for my roommate. They were flavorful, moist, and delicous. Since we could not choose between fries and onion rings we asked for half and half. Cruz was very sweet and smiled while we peppered her with questions and tried to make our final choices. For drinks we ordered the Pineapple Aqua Fresca - made to order with Fresh pineapple, and a silky Strawberry/Banana smoothie. Both were the perfect amount of sweetness. We finished our meal with an order of churros that we shared - Perfect!  We met Juan and Jose who are mentioned in other reviews. Juan owns the business with his family and was genuinely warm and friendly. He sat us at our table, checked on us a couple of times during our meal and cashed us out when we were finished! Incredibly kind, warm and gracious people!  We have already planned our return trip to try their Asian and Mexican fares."}
{"text":"Visiting out of state we wanted to find a quick bite and decided to try this place out. Everything was great, the food came out quickly and our server Cruz was very attentive. If we're ever in this area again definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fast delivery! We ordered bacon cheeseburgers through grubhub and friendly server named Elizabeth arrived with it less than 40 minutes later. The food was great, will definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was good, but I JUST had lunch there and my food and drink was $13! I think the meal was 7.99, I had a diet Pepsi and didn't drink much of it so I asked to take it with me....they must have charged me for another soda.  Soda costs restaurants NOTHING!I WILL NEVER come back because that's PETTY! I gave the waiter a tip,  so my meal,  JUST ME, was almost $20! I GUESS, I should have ordered breakfast? I'm done!"}
{"text":"I was excited considering all the options but none of the food was anything special.  It was all okay, edible but nothing special.  The pancakes were fine, waffle was a little soft but was fine, Orange Chicken was fine and my wife's eggs and hasbrowns were pretty good.  Service was friendly and good and the food was fine but just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Jose's service was really great. My family loved the food.  Chilaquiles are to die for . Hawaiian Fire and Orange Chicken were really great as well.  We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Location might deter you from going in but don't let the looks fool you, food is delicious, service is friendly and place is clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice family place. We have a large family and everyone had something different. I had the Dan Dan noodles. It had just the right amount of kick. Noodles were cooked just right and cucumbers gave it a cool feeling.  We also had the street taco plate. Our son ate every morsel on the entire plate.  Our younger boys had orange chicken, it was crispy and delicious. The fried rice was good and filled with fresh vegetables.  My husband had breakfast for dinner. He had the French toast, scrambled eggs (with cheese), bacon that melted in his mouth and hash browns that were perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside. He declared this place his new breakfast go-to!! The aquas frescas were delicious but we were so stuffed we couldn't finish them!  The wait staff was super friendly and attentive and the owner/manager Jose came and made sure we were happy with our meal. So nice!  Definitely worth a try!  They also do pick up and delivery."}
{"text":"If you work downtown and you haven't eaten here you are wrong! Delicious food, great service and usually little to no waiting for tables. Great new location, much more room for seating. American, Chinese, Mexican and breakfast all day long."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Cruz was a phenomenal waitress too!! We needed a quick place to meet up for lunch because my husband and I work in separate areas... This place was not only quick but so so delicious!! I highly recommend the lettuce wraps! BOMB DOT COM!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, something for everyone! Mexican food, Asian food, breakfast!! Jose is an awesome waiter who took the time to give us recommendations on the best entrees."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to my place of work. If I'm feeling indecisive or am short on time, this is my go-to place. They're quick, very friendly, always clean, and I love the variety of options. It's like a diner with its array of food genres from Asian and Mexican to American and classic breakfast options. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Elizabeth almost always serves me and she's never without a kind smile."}
{"text":"Great little place, really good breakfast! Excellent service! Went there with coworkers while in Phoenix on business, and was really happy with it. Will come back again when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio cruz muy atenta  y Juanita también se los recomiendo la comida con sabor casero"}
{"text":"The breakfast food is the only food I've tried so far. I'll be honest though, I keep coming back because of that watermelon water. It's just so dang awesome. I've been trying to make it myself, but so far have been unsuccessful. I don't mind coming back here for some nice waffles and watermelon water though."}
{"text":"Had a great early lunch here today.  The Chinese Hawaiian Chicken was so good.  I ordered the plate and took half of it home.  Looking forward to stopping in again when I visit the State Land Department for business."}
{"text":"It was clean but they did not have coffee ready when we came and only had the slow drip pots. The waiter was very awkward and not really very friendly. The eggs had an odd seasoning on them."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful tostada dinner there.  It came with a tomatillo sauce that was of a salad dressing consistency suited perfectly for the fresh lettuce on each of four crunchy tostada shells!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Always drive by and finally tried it. Hawaiian fire chicken and pineapple fruit water were delish! Doesn't look like much on the outside but very clean inside and the bathroom too! Elizabeth was super sweet! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very nice people. Loss of options (bordering on too many), but the Mexican food was great and the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"Come see Janet and Saray! Great food! Great service! Great portions! They are very welcoming and friendly, the food is very good and the fruit waters are very refreshing, made fresh to order."}
{"text":"This is a great \"hole in the wall\" restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the food was delicious. Make sure you try the fruit water because it is really refreshing."}
{"text":"Well I went here this morning with a couple of friends because we wanted some good breakfast. I got the meat lovers plate, one friend got the buscuits and gravy and the other got the waffle combo. All of us thought the food was great and everything was under $7 a dish. The waitress was super nice. Honestly I think this place is the best breakfast place I have been to. The hashbrowns and pancakes were both delicious and I can't find a single thing to complain about. My coffee cup was always refilled, and they were playing good music. What more do you need from a place?"}
{"text":"Not really close to a 5star standard, but good quality food in large portions at reasonable pricing, although I'd skip the dinky undercooked spring roll. Plenty of free parking but a sketchy area in general,  And, the building specifically is not appealing. The staff is friendly and helpful. All told, worth going again, especially for Mexican breakfast, but not worth a long drive cross town."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and ordered burritos. They were good. I would not go out of my way to eat here but will eat here again the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great Taqiutos. Manager and staff very welcoming. Good neighborhood restaurant. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"International House of Food is as legit as they come. I can't be more thankful that this place is within walking distance of my house as every time I've eaten here the food has been delicious. I've yet to try the Chinese options, but all of the American diner-style food has never left me anything but satisfied.   The true stars of the menu thus far, however, have been the Mexican options. For my most recent visit I had the huaraches with the al pastor meat. Numerous flavors and an adequate amount of food make this a darn near perfect dish.   There's a sick mural inside, it's a small operation run by genuine people, and it's a neighborhood spot, so I'd encourage anyone and everyone to give them a shot because businesses like this one are what we need more of."}
{"text":"Great service, food was served quickly. I ordered the special enchiladas & eggs very good. Definitely will be coming back here and the prices are reasonable. The staff was very friendly, and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing the great reviews and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is simple, but the service and food are top notch. We started with onion rings, then the Hawaiian fire chicken and kung pao beef, and ended with the churros. Amazing! They have a wide variety of food and the price is right. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"A few of my co-workers and I ordered delivery for lunch. It was our first time ordering but now we wish we had been ordering from this place all along!  You get a healthy amount of food for a great price."}
{"text":"Was a while ago but I had tacos, husband had orange chicken and fried rice. Everything was really good!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We were in town for the weekend for a concert and picked it at random. Delicious food, super friendly and attentive staff, and very clean. I wish we lived here so we could come back!"}
{"text":"Nice clean and spacious. Friendly and welcoming service. Ordered breakfast special chilaquiles. Eggs over medium were perfect! Nice portion very tasty.  Not downtown that often, but when I am, will return."}
{"text":"This is my first time dining at The International House of Food. The Interior of the restaurant is very neat & clean yet, has an unique resemblance of a Senior Citizen Community Center. The dish I ordered was the Hawaiian Fire Chicken. I opt for the fried rice with it. The dish looked amazing. After trying the dish, I was not impressed with the flavor. I also thought, especially for a first visit, that the waitress could have came by at least once and asked me how was my meal or at the least knew about the 10% Yelp check-in deal. The dish did not wow me and the soda was not tasty & strong. In conclusion, this meal with added drink, should not have cost nearly $15. I may return. But, if I do, it won't be for any of the Asian dishes. Let's leave that to Asian Restaurants to do.... CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"GrubHub made my day by delivering tasty food on a day when I wasn't leaving the pleasant AC of my office. I ordered the Huaraches and the Carne Asada Fries. The huaraches with chorizo were fantastic! The fries, meh.  The aguas frescas look amazing, but I didn't know how well those would travel. Next time, though."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food with some interesting plates beyond what you typically see in the United States."}
{"text":"OMGOMGOMGNOMNOMNOMNOM   1. Cruz is such a GREAT hostess!!!  So kind and helpful!!! 2. The FOOD!!!  So much choice!  I had Hawaiian Fire Chinese--friend had Huaraches -- JUST TO DIE FOR 3. So MUCH FOOD on our plates!!!"}
{"text":"better late than never- many visits, first yelp.  I go here for three and ONLY THREE reasons. Nothing more. Nothing less.  1) I order the same thing every time because its a magical bowl of magic aka Chicken Fried Rice *chicken extra crispy. Its LITERALLY the best fried rice one can ever consume- i can tell by the utter satisfaction my belly feels when i eat the ungodly serving size they give you. Get a side of fried egg o/m to really feel the magic.  2) Watermelon Water- I'm not gonna get into it- if you're near 10th (ish) Ave and Van Buren, stop what you're doing and go get some. I don't care if you don't like watermelon, just go get some and give it to someone you know so they can tell you how magical it is. This is obviously a test of faith to you non-believers. Go forth and enjoy!  3) This thing people call \"customer service\". I thought it was a rumor until i went to the IHOF- see what i did there? Anyhoo, it was amazing. From the gal at the register, Janet, to the magicians hovering over the cooking flames in the very open kitchen, EVERYONE was super willing and flexible with my ridiculous diva-esque requests. Picky eater? who cares (this may not be accurate)!! They could probably tell you NO and have you walk out of there feeling like your shit don't stink. They have never made me feel silly or unwelcome.   Thanks IHOF- for keeping it real. Maybe ill eat something different one day- probably not though. stay classy."}
