{"text":"We ordered the toothpick chicken, their toothpick chicken is the same as popcorn chicken. Taste is on the salty side; they offer chilli and cumin powder so you can adjust the taste to your likes.  We found it a bit too salty and greasy for us. Plus, as we  waited for 10 mins for our order, the smell of oil and chicken was very strong. After we left the place, the smell remained all over our clothes and hair."}
{"text":"The store just opened this week. The store is not huge but nicely decorated. We ordered a 4 pc and a chicken burger to eat in store. The fried chicken came out super fresh and did not have the kind of oily smell you find at Popeye's or KFC. It had just enough crunch and you can tell it wasn't heavily breaded. They put an interesting mix of spice in the chicken that distinguishes it from regular fast food. We're gonna come back here for sure!"}

I stopped by here today with a friend for a \"quick snack\" which turned out to be an extremely long wait for only subpar food. We only came here because we caught this amazing whiff of fried chicken that's sure to make any non-vegetarian salivate as we walked by... but as soon as we stepped through those doors, we were dying from the extreme humidity and poor ventilation inside. You know when you're eating something hot and vinegary and you accidentally inhale the fumes before you take your first bite and you start choking and coughing? That's exactly what it feels like to be inside here.

Also, the 2 staff members that were present were terrible - frantically running around and not remembering who ordered what even though the receipts were all clearly on their counter. They would both go into the kitchen for 10~20 minutes without coming back out to take orders and 20 minutes after you've ordered, they would come back to your table asking what you ordered... 

In total, my wait time was 40 minutes for 1 order of toothpick chicken and 1 order of takoyaki. Ridiculous. Although my takoyaki was a takeout order, I still expected it to be prepared with all the sauces and toppings in a box-like container... but nope I was served 4 dry plain balls with only a tiny container of sauce on the side. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Chicken is ok. Tasty but it is on the greasy side though. We ordered the chicken pieces to go and was surprised to see that the drumette is considered as one piece and the wingette/flat and tip is another piece.  In other words, they split the chicken wing into 2.  If I decide to come back, I will opt for other pieces than the wings."}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Had the chicken toothpicks and tenders. The chicken was crispy and juicy on the inside. The portion is more than enough for two people. Super spicy too! 

Then go across to get icecream at QQ and call it a good evening"}
{"text":"Was in the area to meet up with friends for some food but i was super early and had wanted a small bite before going for dinner. I walked around the entire plaza and finally decided on mr.six because of their captivating offers such as a) Chicken Burger + 2 Pieces of Chicken + Drink for 12.99 and b) 10% off with valid student card. They had me at 10% off. I walked in and the place smelled like a glorious haven for all foods greasy. Super nice staff that pointed out which items on their menu were popular and informed me if something was spicy. I ordered and took a seat. The place was really small. They only have 4 tables and fits probably 15 people at most before it becomes too crowded. Chicken was made fresh as it did take a while before it was ready. What i didn't like was how i kept hearing the microwave door open and close and the beeping sounds it makes when the food is done heating up. Please be a little more discrete. 

Nonetheless, the chicken was amazing! It was a little greasy, but it was delicious! It was crispy, moist and it was marinated in spices that made my tongue go straight into heaven. The chicken was phenomenal. 

The burger i had ordered was really great as well. It wasn't a small piece of tiny chicken like McDonalds. We're talking about a full size chicken cutlet on this hamburger bun. The burger was kept really simple, cheese, lettuce, chicken and mayo. They really wanted the consumer to taste the chicken and to indulge in how moist and delicious the chicken was. 

I absolutely loved the place, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. 

I have only ordered the chicken pieces every single time with spices on top. IMO, the spices is what makes this chicken so good. 

Price is definitely on the more expensive side since the combos don't come with drinks or sides whereas for Popeyes and KFC, they come with drinks and sides for cheaper than just chicken at this restaurant. 

All in all, it would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the price. Definitely worth trying if you're a fried chicken lover like myself!"}
{"text":"There was nothing special about the chicken. It was normal fried chicken that tasted like herbs and gingseng.. Which I guess is their way of making it asian fried chicken lol. Pretty expensive but it's a small cute place"}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 piece chicken for $7.99 and added a pop and fries for $3.
For the fried chicken, I had spicy powder and cumin powder sprinkled on top. Definitely necessary for flavour because without it, it is pretty generic fried chicken. I should have done the same with my fries but ketchup did suffice. I got 2 drums and a thigh piece.
It's not bad but it's nothing that would make me want/need to go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick bite with my friend. At first, we were skeptical of this place due to all the construction and renovations that were happening outside the restaurant. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by two servers who seemed really kind because they kept smiling, however they were being somewhat awkward and quiet (not a bad thing I guess). The ambience isn't that amazing at this place as it's more of a fast food joint. I would recommend that you do take-out instead of dining in. The prices are pretty decent here for the portion you get.

My friend and I both got the spicy chicken burger with cheese and it was so good! We both enjoyed it. The only thing that could've been better about the burger would've been for the burger to be more crispier. It looked crispy from the outside, but once we started eating it we realized it wasn't as crispy as it looked."}
