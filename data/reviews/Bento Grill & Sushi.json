{"text":"Decided to try this place out before I got my boys back to school haircuts.
It's a step up from Edo's IMO. 
They have basically the same menu as Edo, and the bento boxes are similar.
What I like about this place os the spicy sushi roll sauce etc are out for you take at no extra charge. I also find the quality of the beef and chicken is better than that of Edo.
Portions are larger as well.
The restaurant itself is clean bright and new.
Washrooms were decent as well.

If you ever have an Edoish craving then this might be a good option for you. However if you want better quality, go to a proper sit down Japanese restaurant."}

{"text":"The first time we visited Bento, we were quite dissapointed as we pre-ordered our sushi and came and hour and a half later and found out that our order was not ready. 

We had to wait another hour before our food was ready. Other customers were also complaining that they have been waiting for an hour for their food and want their money back. Safe to say we didn't enjoy our first trip there. The sushi was okay, nothing special at all.

We wanted to give them a second chance, so we ordered the same large platter and we didn't wait too long this time. The sushi was fine as well, again nothing special. But overall they redeemed themselves that's why I'm giving them 2 stars. That's mostly because of the fact that the sushi is cheaply priced and it's not all that bad. I would give them 3 stars if their staff had a bit more people skills and smiled at least when greeting customers.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you would like to enjoy your sushi. Edo would probably a better choice for cheap sushi. If you want really cheap sushi and you're not in a hurry then you can try Bento."}
{"text":"First time checking out Bento Sushi and seemed promising however have been waiting over 15 minutes for my Sashimi Bento Box to go.  To their defence there were 3 people in front of me but was hoping for a quicker service."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. It's sort of like Edo but 100x better. This place is way worth your money than Edo ever will be. I say this because not only is the service here good, the food is absolutely amazing. I came here maybe 4x in the past month and every single time I came, I had zero problems with the food. It's always hot, fresh, and tasty. I honestly hope this place stays at 130th for a very long time because I don't know any other Japanese restaurants that's as good as this place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Seriously. This was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a fast food restaurant. The rice for the sushi was way to moist. The edamame were so disgusting. They were brown from being cooked way to far in advance and they were cold too. The yam chips. Wtf was that crap? 1 they were cold. 2 they were obviously re-fried, but not served to me warm. 
I will never be back to this place. Doubt it'll still be around come the new year anyways. 
Don't waste your time or money here. Just disgusting."}
