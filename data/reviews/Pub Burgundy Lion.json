{"text":"It's a great place! Some friends recently moved to Saint-Henri and we found it hard finding a place to go to and the Burgundy Lion was a very cool discovery. There's a wide variety of alcohols. Great place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"I've been there more times that I can count.  The main reason is that the people there work so hard and so well.  The food is great for pub food, better than many restos. The alcohol can get a little expensive and it's unfortunate you can only buy beer by the glass but I can see a few reasons for that (other than the obvious lucrative aspect for the owner).  Waiters are always there to check if you're ok and need anything else and make you feel looked after and appreciated.  Quality-price the best place in the entire area."}
{"text":"Went here back in January.  I remember it was a bit loud but the food was good.  Bangers & Mash with chef-made sausage with a nice flavor.  Rest of family enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Montreal! A must go for any whiskey/scotch admirers, mac n cheese fans, pub cuisine lovers, and pretty much anyone in between.  A very knowledgeable staff curates a laid back experience in a welcoming environment. The menu offers variety and options but I personally am bummed the tomato soup has been replaced by gazpacho for the spring/summer. Mind you, they're both awesome.  Great spot for after work beers, filling supper or a rowdy night."}
{"text":"The Lion is what they consider a gastro pub. The food is great as well as their selection of liquors.  Without a doubt the reason why St. Henri has become a prime destination for many on the western part of the island.  The pub has slowly become a soccer (footy) pub as well.  Arsenal and Chelsea bring in the largest crowds. Upstairs is where u want to be on Saturday and Sunday morning for epl action."}
{"text":"Really good English brunch! I ordered the full English breakfast, and loved everything in the plate. The thick bacon is a must and their potatoes are so flavourful with garlic on top. Watch out if you don't like garlic cuz I saw ppl complained about it. To me it's better with garlic. Brunch is fairly priced but their drinks are expensive."}
{"text":"We had been here once before for drinks and it was great. The menu was intriguing so we planned to come again for dinner.   We made reservations and gave the food a shot. As a bar, this place is wonderful for drinks, conversation, and for watching pretty people. The food was not bad - slightly above average pub food. Interesting menu (we started with the cold avocado and cucumber soup and the pork cheek) but our mains were less impressive. My burger was fine but my husband's roast beef was disappointingly skimpy on the beef. A lot of mashed potatoes though. Sunday roast is a sacred English tradition, people! Next time I want to see thick slabs of bleeding meat."}
{"text":"Solid English Pub with decent food.  The Burgundy Lion isn't particularly remarkable, but it serves its purpose as a neighbourhood pub with a good menu. A fine spot for an afternoon pint, after work bite, or late night drink."}
{"text":"Mon meilleur ami et moi sommes deux grands fans de scotch. Notre pub de scotch favori c'est l'Île Noire, et c'est notre référence. Malheureusement à l'Île Noire il n'y a pas de nourriture, donc des fois mon ami et moi cherchons un endroit qu'il y a une bonne sélection de scotch et de la nourriture. Une connaissance m'a référé au Burgundy Lion.  La nourriture est très bonne. Je m'attendais que ça soit plus de la bouffe de pub, de taverne, mais non, c'est sont des plats qui semblent être typiquement Anglais.   Le décor est excellent, c'est un très bel endroit.  Les serveuses sont jolies. Ça fait partit du décor. :-)  J'ai adoré l'ambiance.   Mais côté scotch, c'est la grande déception. Pourquoi? Simplement car ils sont beaucoup trop cher. 20 à 50% plus cher qu'ailleurs. Il y a le Whiskey Café qui est dans les prix du Burgundy, mais je ne vais plus au Whiskey Café pour ça. Dommage, car la sélection de scotch est très intéressante au Burgundy.   Par exemple, un verre de Macallan 18 ans est 25$ à l'Île Noire. Sachant qu'une bouteille c'est 240$ à la SAQ, 17 verres à 25$ ça rapporte 433$. Le Burgundy vent son Macallan 18 ans à 37$. 629$ qu'une bouteille lui rapporte, ça commence à faire du profit ça mon ami.    Je donnerais 4 étoiles pour cette place, si les prix des scotchs étaient plus adéquats. Mais sinon, si le scotch n'est pas important pour vous, la bière est bonne, ça vaut définitivement un 4 étoile dans mon livre à moi."}
{"text":"Great vibe,service was awesome. I order the special chicken burger which was not on the Menu"}
{"text":"Y suis aller 2 fois. Une fois avec un ami et une fois avec ma femme. Mon ami et moi avons bien aimé, tandis que ma femme n'a pas détesté mais n'a pas été aussi emballée que nous. Le ''Welshman's Bride'' (Jarret d'agneau braisé à la Guinness servi avec purée et légumes) que j'ai mangé et le Lapin du Colonel (Épaules de lapin frites avec Mac n' Cheese ) que mon amis a eu étaient délicieux ainsi que le ''Trifle aux Framboises'' qui était exquis. Le ''Fish & Chips de la Petite Bourgogne'' que ma femme a manger était correct ainsi que le ''Lancashire Pot'' que j'ai eu. Leur bière maison était décevante (De l'eau arômatisée).Ah oui les ''Scotch Egg'' était très bons également.  donc le ''Mac n' Cheese'' et le ''Welshman's Bride'' (Jarret d'agneau braisé à la Guinness servi avec purée et légumes) ainsi que le ''Trifle aux Framboises'' vaut à eux seuls le détour."}
{"text":"THE BEST.  A weekend in Montreal and the Burgundy Lion was one of the two pub-like restaurants that we found on Open Table and said, \"why the hell not?\" We were so glad we trekked out here, which was kind of far from our hotel.  I can't really imagine any city having better British pub food than the Burgundy Lion. First of all, the atmosphere is so wonderful; very dark, inviting, candles on the tables, a nice wooden bar. Very cozy, which was nice after coming in from a freezing cold street at 9:00 in the evening. We didn't get appetizers, but started with some drinks - I had for the first time in my life \"Cidre Mystique\" on draft, which is a Quebecois cider. It was delicious. The draft beer list is good, and unlike a lot of places in Montreal, there are some \"foreigner-friendly\" brands like Guinness and Newcastle.  I had the \"Welshman's Wife\" which is a braised lamb shank in the tastiest sauce imaginable, served with melt-in-your-mouth mash potatoes and sauteed green beans. Everything was incredible. I was prepared for a fatty piece of meat, as lamb shank often is, but this dish was so lean and juicy I could hardly believe that's what I was eating. It was seriously that good.   My cousin had the Shepherd's Pie which was equally incredible, served with an awesomely crispy and light puff pastry.   We shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert which was ridiculously tasty - one of the best sticky toffees I've ever eaten. We knocked back a couple Jamesons and then paid a very reasonable bill.   I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Would not return.  Ordered the shepherd's pie.  Virtually no meat, just a bowl of mashed potatoes with a side of wilted salad.  Totally awful!!"}
{"text":"The Burgundy Lion is one of those places, that you'll always be happy to go to.  The best combination of atmosphere, service, and food.  I often fist for early breakfasts (and to catch a match of football) and the atmosphere at this time is great.  A young crowd is often there (20-30ish) English and French and we have a great time watching and talking.  The service is top-notch - with the waiters and waitresses being genuinely ready to be of help.  Love their attitude.   The food, especially breakfast, is definitely something to come back for.  The menu is not extensive, but what is available is served in generous proportions and fresh (try the English porridge)  Go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Really great cider, good complimentary potato chips, decent music selection."}
{"text":"Just a great place overall. Food, service and athmosphere. The latter especially during the rugby world cup finals."}
{"text":"I don't want to be too hard on Burgundy Lion.  Reason is: there is not much in that area...  It is really practical to have a good pub in a still underdeveloped neighborhood for nights when you just want to have a good drink in a proper setting.  Also a good spot to watch the habs game.    What I like about the Burgundy: Reliable. Cute style.  Always open when you need it.  The blue cheese salad is a keeper, if you are worried about the calories, you can ask for cheddar instead.    What I am not sure about: the heavy breakfast and brunch. If thick pancakes and chubby sausages are your taste, then Burgundy is your place.  English style is good.  But for me, might be too heavy.    What I don't like: while there are lots of people there; there's not that much mingling."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly service, up-and-coming trendy location, and good food, however, avoid the mixed drinks or the Burgundy Lion brew.  The burger here is probably one of my favourites in Montreal (you can order them medium-rare).  The food is pretty good, as long as you don't order the steak and kidney pie."}
{"text":"Great place with great food and a great buzz. On a Saturday night, the place is crowded. It is pub food, and nothing is more pub than fish and chips. They are delicious, flaky and piping hot. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is yummy. It's worth going even if it is just for a drink with buddies. They have a great selection of beer, whiskey and a TV to watch the games."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks one night with a friend. Even though the place was packed, we never felt rushed to leave, and our server was very nice. Ordered the fish and chips (was told it was a house specialty) and it was decent but nothing to write home about. Fish was two thick (but short) pieces and was quite tasty and chips were a generous portion. (Unfortunately the chips were quite bland but came with a couple of nice dips to give them some flavour.)   My main hesitation of coming back here again (for dinner) is that it was very loud. My voice is naturally not very loud and even when I'm yelling at top volume my friends have to lean in a bit to hear me, so I might steer clear of this place at night when a few drinks have made it a bit rowdier than usual."}
{"text":"Went there recently, I liked the music, tried the beer brewed on site which was quite good. The staff are courteous."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends from NYC and it was the first stop upon arrival for lunch. Typical pub style - nice decor, friendly staff, food was decent enough - my fish n chips was good and the presentation of it was nice, my friends shepherds pie could use some work though (don't order it). Beers and cider were delish, now let's get to my favorite part, the check. We each put our share in with tip and called it a day, why did the waitress (not our original male server) come back to ask if the tip we put was exactly what we wanted to put down??? yes missy it is, did we speak chinese to you the first time when we asked for the bill? No, so go away. Okay so to make an awkward situation worse, we hand her an extra $5 on top of the $13 we had already put down (american too, so enjoy the extra 20cents per dollar when you exchange the currency sweetcheeks), she still stood there and counted the bills in front of us and said it wasn't enough..we hand her an extra $10 on top it and she happily walks away while i sat there in shock like, did that just happen? now, we're not cheap people and will gladly tip the 18-20% but for a waitress to have the audacity to ask for more tip without even checking to see if our service was good to begin with blows me away. Thankfully this was the start of the trip and while it started off with a low, the rest of the trip was pure high, go to joe beef across the street instead, while we didn't get to go we heard fab things about it, pretty sure they don't beg for tips either."}
{"text":"I love coming here for brunch, it's one of my favourites. Really good food, generous portions and very affordable prices!"}
{"text":"The outside terrasse was inviting and pleasant, and the entire pub had such a good aroma and atmosphere that we were immediately drawn to stay for food. The service was sweet and cheerful if on the slow side, but as with many quirky Montréal places that is to be expected. I asked our server what she thought about the \"Lapin du Colonel\" and she said it was delicious but a bit \"cochon\", as in not on the healthy or light side. The rabbit came fried with a delicious sauce on the side, and a generous serving of the most gloriously creamy Mac and Cheese I've ever had in a restaurant. I had several glasses of orange juice and a glass of white wine (a humble but yummy Sauvignon Blanc) and it was a lovely early afternoon on one of the nicest streets in St Henri! It was a beautiful day and I will readily recommend this delicious pub any time!"}
{"text":"Excellent bar with excellent food. I recommend the fish and chips. The fish is perfectly cooked and the fries are just right. The poutine with roast beef is the best poutine I have had so far but the real star of the show is the sticky toffee cake . I could have just come to eat that. Very tasty. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Watched the world cup final here. 4 stars for pints and atmosphere, 3 stars for the food. Cod cakes were remarkably bland, poutine was meh. Good wait staff."}
{"text":"Always packed. Suuuuuper straight. Very very very loud. Tasty food."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and it seems like they changed their menu. I chose the English Poutine topped with blue cheese, curd cheese, caramelized onions and a whiskey-based gravy. It was the worst poutine I've ever eaten. The mix of blue cheese with the whiskey-flavored gravy was just too overpowering and the caramelized onions did nothing to help this dish. If you must try this out, I strongly suggest you order the blue cheese on the side. I wish I had. The service was great but the rating is exclusively for tonight's experience. I've eaten here before and I've always had a good meal. It's too bad they had to screw up on such a simple dish."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast while watching English premier league! Excellent garlicky potatoes and mushrooms, flavourful tomatoes and bread a choice includes crumpets!  Excellent, attentive and kind service!"}
{"text":"Love that place! Great authentic Pub the beer and food is amazing! Love the roast beef poutine, the salads are great also! Great place to go for 5 @ 7."}
{"text":"A British Pub in Griffintown. Had fish and chips with a beer. Was very noisy in a warm afternoon in spring (may-june).  I'va had better fish and chips, maybe I was hoping for something great.  It was OK.  Service is very good and quick. Lots of movement all around, tables moving, loud music.  If this is what you like, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Just had the Full English breakfast. Absolutely killer! This is my Sunday morning from now on!"}
{"text":"The place was pretty crowded on a Saturday night but they squeezed us in. Good food and drinks (had the Ploughman's lunch) and the servers are very attentive. Fun ambiance too."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the habs-bruins game, great atmosphere, great pub food. Their alcohol selection is big and nice.  I had fish and chips, great with generous portions. Had the sticky toffee pudding and it was also great. Nice place, gets really crowded during sports events, nice staff."}
{"text":"Angus burger was outstanding. The pint of Newcastle was creamy and frothy. The Americano coffee smooth. Went there for an early lunch on a Monday, very satisfying."}
{"text":"Ambiance is definitely there. The food is fairly priced but not great. The booze is pricey."}
{"text":"Staff are a little snooty. Good ambience. If you are not a regular it's like you don't exist."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool spot to grab a drink. They boast the largest selection of scotch and whiskies of any establishment in the province. The food quality has been in constant decline for the past 3-4 years, everything dish seems thrown together without much care. Meat is of average quality and sometimes overcooked and too dry."}
{"text":"Delicious shepherds pie - but it was cold when served. Still tasted good - wouldn't consider it an ideal place for dinner but definitely a fun place for a late night hang-out with friends."}
{"text":"A pretty good place, especially for the area. A good hangout for drinks. Food is decent, although a little overpriced. Don't order the cucumber soup (bleh) but fish and chips are decent and their hamburger is good. Service is good, really nice waiters. I would like to try brunch here! Their outdoor seating is a plus!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, music, and most importantly-food.  Came here for brunch. We sat inside but there's a nice patio if you walk halfway in that looks great. We had a party of 8 so we took what we could get.  I started with a Bloody Caesar (which is a spicy Bloody Mary with Clamato instead of tomato juice, if you're not familiar) and for my meal got a scotch egg side and the full English breakfast with poached eggs and crumpets.  The bloody was spicy and delicious and the breakfast was huge. The scotch egg came with some kind of horseradish condiment that was surprisingly good. The English breakfast came with thick slab bacon, sausage, blood sausage, beans, grilled tomato, two eggs, two crumpets, the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had, with a delicious ketchup (which was unexpected since I usually hate ketchup- there was something really tasty in this one though). Left happy and full and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Place was packed on Tuesday lunchtime. Outdoor seating in the street can be nerverack since its on the street...ha. Prices seem a bit steep but they have good quality and all the Brit faves."}
{"text":"Great pub with perfect atmosphere, good drink selections, and generally good food.  Most importantly it was the perfect place to watch a World Cup match - in this case the Women's World Cup championship game.  Poutine was very good, though I have to say the Roast Beef dinner was average at best - I've had MUCH better Sunday Roasts in England and I was hoping this would be better at The Burgundy Lion.  But the beer selection was good, whiskeys were extensive if that's your thing, and it was a great place to watch football.  Plus, it's a cool neighborhood and well worth a visit."}
{"text":"We visited as a group of four on a Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday.  It was definitely an enjoyable meal!  The food is great.  The menu has all kinds of traditional pub fare, such as fish and chips, bangers and mash, etc, but extremely well done.  We started off with stuffed yorkshire puddings and samosas.  I would definitely return one evening just to have a pint and some more yorkshire puddings, they were that good.  Our mains were equally excellent, and well presented too.  It is a beautiful space, I could tell a lot of time and $$$ went into renovations.    The only downfall was that the waitstaff could have been a little more attentive.  It wasn't all that busy, and yet we sometimes had a hard time getting a hold of our waitress to ask for our bill, and then to actually pay."}
{"text":"We came here under the pretense that it would be a good experience. I believe if you're looking to get drunk and loud, then this is the place. Unfortunately for us, it was a let down.  Drinks are plentiful and there are plenty of screens to watch sports on. So if you are looking to do that, you might want to head down to this pub.  However, we were looking for good food and great beers. They didn't deliver on both counts.  Right when you step in, it is loud. I mean it is a pub, so I didn't expect anything else. The set up was awkward; we waited by the door, not knowing if we were to sit down on our own or wait for a hostess. A few minutes later a server saw us standing and waved down another waitress to seat us.   We were seated but the first sign of trouble started; there were gnats and flies flying all around us. Umm, gross.   Then it took a while for the waitress to come down. She didn't give very friendly service. Throughout, the service was slow and sporadic.   My boyfriend said his beers were just \"OK\". Whatever that means. He ordered the fish and chips. You would think something that has two items would be prepared fairly decent, but the chips were chewy and lacking any seasoning. The fish itself was super oily.  I ordered the roast with Yorkshire pudding. The Yorkshire pudding and meat were cooked very well. This would have been a one star review if it wasn't for those two items. However, the veggies were all cooked unevenly. It was expensive meal for what we both got.  I wouldn't return to this place. However, if you're looking to be loud and drunk, I believe this is your place. To each their own."}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas croire que je n'avais jamais mis les pieds au mythique Burgundy Lion !   Situé sur Notre-Dame près du théâtre Corona Virgin, le pub traditionnel anglais m'a ravi. Choix de plats typiquement anglais (saucisses, agneau, fish&chips) et abordables, faits sur place. Les boissons sont également variées : whisky, bières, vin et cocktails divers sont confectionnés devant vos yeux. Honnêtement, j'ai bien aimé mon expérience et le service, j'y retournerais sans hésiter."}
{"text":"Valeur sûre de la petite bourgogne. Le Burgundy est toujours bondé de monde, ce qui veut aussi dire que l'ambiance y est. Le fish & chip est toujours aussi bon, les bloodys sont bons aussi. C'est un excellent spot pour des soupers de gang, ou juste avant un show au Corona."}
{"text":"The Place and the ambiance are really atractive, and the menu really affordable.   Just one thing: Why all the pretty waitresses are so rough to serve??? It seem like always the tips than we give is not enough! (between 15 and 20% always)   And badly: what is the problem to serve in french???  I've been arrived a couple of times with french people and you can tell: the service is not the same! Shame"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me know that I hate pubs with a passion but this place is AWESOME.  We came here as a group of girls for a pseudo bachelorette dinner and we had a great time.  We had a nice huge corner booth that was semi private, lots of food (all of it delicious), and great drinks. Service was quite fast for such a busy evening and prices were decent.  I think what sets this pub apart is the fact that it's classier than most others..it's not a dingy and dirty pub like most of the ones found in this city..   Oh, and for the record, the shepherds pie was awesome! Mmm I'm drooling just thinking of it..."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, tasty food, some star-watching if you are lucky, and nice cold beer.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The Burgundy Lion is my favourite pub in Montreal, and I go past many others to get to it (I live on the opposite side of downtown.) The beauty of a good pub is that it offers a cozy, authentic atmosphere and pulls together food from around the Commonwealth in a competent way. There are far too many \"pubs\" that think they can offer Newcastle and Guinness on tap along with 20 varieties of Molson/Bud and serve burgers and fries. The Lion says \"piss on that\" and has a great bar and food menu!  I have tried about 10 things (5 of my own, 5 or 6 friends' dishes) in the past 6 months, and the only mediocre item was the Colonel's Rabbit (the batter wasn't very special....although the accompanying Mac n Cheese was excellent.) Everything else, from the Toad in the Hole to the Colonial Chicken to Lancashire Pot is very nicely done (for a pub....this is not haute cuisine, of course.) The Fish & Chips are very good, although I'd visit Brit & Chips (owned by the same company) if you want the best I've found in town. The Yorkies are excellent (and my personal favourite at any decent pub.)   The service at the BL is great, too. Everyone is friendly, has a number of tailored food/drink recommendations, and unlike so many places in Montreal, they clear your dishes and quickly and top up your water regularly, even if that's all you order to drink. Even the security guards (weekend evenings) are nice and will strike up conversations as they watch over the crowds.   This place has weekly events and a very clear schedule on their website of when everything is happening. They are also involved in the community. I went to a really great costume party the Saturday before Halloween 2011 that was raising money for breast cancer, and they are also celebrating/fundraising for \"Movember\" for men's cancers.   I am not sure if I would frequent this place on a busy Friday or Saturday night, as it turns into a crowded, loud stand-up meat market, but were I 5 years younger and single, I might like that, too.  The Burgundy Lions does everything it can to get a 3 or 4 star rating relative to its Montreal counterparts, and gets a 5th star for all the extra effort, the \"don't quite know what\" (the Briton's translation of what we say here, \"je ne sais quoi\") that puts it kings' heads and lions' tails above its competition."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for a week and tried this last night. Great place for drinks and food.  There were a lot of people..very busy so we were excited to try. Their whiskey list is impressive.  My bf tried a whiskey tasting and I ordered red rum as a cocktail. For dinner I ordered georgie's catch and my bf got the vegetation masher curry with shrimp. Both were delicious and dessert was raspberry trifle.   highly recommend any one to try ...even if just drinks"}
{"text":"Amazing whiskey tasting.  Toby (the owner) was knew so much about all the whiskeys, the food was great, service was great and our group had a blast.  Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Quick snack n vino right after landing in #montreal -  the porkbelly mash was amazing - and heavy -  but so good. Pair it off w/the Montepuciano Di Abruzzo table red -- awesome.  Try to score a patio seat! Super cool street for foodies- #Joebeef is right across the street from joint.  If you can't get in there - venture off to #pubburgundylion - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today with the boyfriend and mother. We had the Full English Breakfast, myself and my boyfriend with english muffins and my mother with crumpets, and to start, both the muffins and crumpets were store bought, same as we can get at the grocery store.  Next, the portions were tiny. We've had much more food at other places, 1 small sausage, the tiniest piece of ham you could possibly imagine, as if they took a thin slice, cut it in to 4 pieces and serve one quarter of it per plate, and a small piece of slab bacon that was mostly fat (which my boyfriend didn't even get on his plate). He enjoyed the blood pudding, the fried tomatoes were not fried, and there were maybe 6 tiny mushrooms on the plate. The eggs were small and flat and bland, and the beans were sitting in a bowl of molasses. And the potatoes were COVERED in large pieces of garlic, which the English have never used as far as I know. My mother Hates garlic. All in all, Not impressed whatsoever by this $13 dish. I've spent less at La Belle Province and been far more satisfied.  And this is not a very English breakfast, my mother is English and we've had breakfast in England. This was insulting."}
{"text":"Just a solid neighborhood pub. Good atmosphere. Good English tap list. Didn't eat anything. Impressive selection of scotch. Was full 2pm on mon."}
{"text":"Très beau pub anglais dans la Petite-Bourgogne. Décor chaleureux. Endroit parfait pour les repas entre amis.  Puisque c'est près de chez moi, j'y suis déjà allée plusieurs fois pour des soupers entre amis, avec la famille et également pour des anniversaires. Chaque fois la nourriture était assez bonne et les prix sont raisonnables. Les portions sont très généreuses. Par contre, il me semble que l'alcool est dispendieux. Lorsque je pense à leurs plats, j'ai bien hâte d'y aller, mais sur place je regrette toujours un peu mon choix de restaurant....Pourtant c'est si agréable de se retrouver sur la terrasse l'été!  Gigantesque point négatif : le service est exécrable. Le personnel ne sourit pas. Les serveuses/serveurs ont l'air de trouver pénible leur emploi, mais semblent bien s'amuser entre eux derrière les bars (en oubliant un peu la clientèle malheureusement). Chaque fois nous avons dû demander maintes fois des verres d'eau (qui ne sont jamais arrivés), le menu, la carte des desserts, des vins, etc. Il manquait toujours quelque chose. Nous avons aussi dû, à plusieurs reprises, aller chercher le serveur directement au bar pour l'informer qu'il nous manquait ceci ou cela puisqu'il ne passait jamais à notre table."}
{"text":"I went to this bar on a Thursday night to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the bangers and mash after a couple of drinks. 30 minutes after ordering my food it still had not arrived. I politely asked the waitress how much longer the food would take as I did not have all night. She got angry and told me the food would be there shortly. My friend works at the restaurant and told me she spit in my food. Thank god I didn't eat it"}
{"text":"We just had a dinner at this place.  Beautiful weather-Finally , patio, good cold beer, good menu.. nothing to complain about. Definitely we will go back. Pims cup was very good, beers on tap were very good too.  Nice neighbor bar!  It was the first dinner out since we moved here - yesterday :). Yay for my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I really liked the decor of this place- very low key relaxed feel. The crowd seemed a bit younger for a Friday night but that didn't deter my from enjoying my night.  I went for drinks and had a whiskey flight, my first in Montreal - so I was delighted, with over 500 whiskeys to select from - their September special included a 3 whiskey sampler for 18$!  Amazing deal- definitely will come back to sample"}
{"text":"Food is ok, drinks are gd but couldn't stay longer than 45 min the music was so loud i couldn't even have a conversation with my friends... The Music is annoying"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hearty meal to go along side of a nice cold beer, this it the place for you! Warm, peacefully atmosphere, and helpful serves. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great pub located in Little Burgundy, a quaint little neighborhood just below the hustle and bustle of downtown Montreal. From my pub experience in the area, this is as \"British Pub\" as it gets, and you can tell by what's served on the menu too (various types of braised meat, roast, fish & chips, different meat pie's, and porridge, among others of course).  I came with a group of friends, we knocked back a few (great) Irish car bombs, while some of my friends enjoyed Burgundy Lion's selection of Scotch. They have a good selection of draft beers too, my favourites being: Stella Artois, Carlsberg, and Sapporo. They, of course, serve Guinness, among other more 'original' and unique ale's.   The atmosphere is great! The staff is friendly and tends to pay attention to their customers, even when it gets loud and busy. You may have trouble finding a table or seats, so the earlier you go, the better, or you just may have to wait. There is a nice outdoor area in the back that opens up in the summer-fall as well!   No matter what you come for, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Understated elegance! Come as you are and be treated like royalty! The building is a historical hotel with lots is cool new retro classical white linen and iron. Service was personal and not looking over my shoulder like other place. Drinks were amazing. Clean crystal bar and wine list was nice! Patio available and space for large groups. Old town charm! Lobsters on site in tank. Family of 5 ate til full. Great food diversity on menu! Lovely place! Don't miss"}
{"text":"Great place. The food is much better than I expected. The Colonial Chicken is so good that I came back and ordered it again 2 days later. The staff is super friendly & welcoming. Easy on the eyes as well."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a solid pub, Burgundy Lion is this non pretentious place where you know you'll eat fresh and good food plus get good beer. They have this nice little indoor patio in the middle of the restaurant, which could feel quite romantic I find. They also have a patio outside of the restaurant. You get fresh food for a fair price and get served with a smile and a joke from time to time. Decor is very simple but nice. Only thing we weren't crazy about was the dessert, but otherwise, it's a winner."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with Burgundy Lion; I had lunches; I had dinners and I had drinks. This time we went for brunch for Mother's Day. Overall, everything was ok, but the service by our waitress killed the vibe. She is always rushing, and she doesn't take the complete order. She asks for our drinks orders; we order 3 mimosas and she jumps in she says and water for everyone else. No!!! Other 3 persons want to order different drinks. She was horrible listener. We even heard other customers getting upset at her; and told her \"LISTEN\". The waitress told the client very rudely \"I am listening \". Anyway, she did the same thing during our main dish order. I am not sure if due the poor service, that we did not enjoy our food as much as we always do, or the food have been just average. Everything tasted so bland. Some of toasts, and naans were partially burned. The only thing we enjoyed was the drinks. My mom said, she will never come back here. :("}
{"text":"Location: Notre-Dame O. The nearest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's about a 10-minute walk from there.   The place: Pub-ish, with wood floors and decor, and of course, the standard British bar set-up. They have two floors and two terraces - the one in the middle of the pub is pretty cool and will definitely be worth checking out once they open it up. The layout is OK but the massive staircase in the middle of the place takes up a lot of space and is almost immediately in front of the entrance.   The food: I hate to go against the grain but I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's standard breakfast fare and there isn't anything exceptional about it. I ordered The Yank which included eggs, potatoes, a side of meat (your choice - I went with sausage), a side of bread (again, your choice - I got the English muffin) and a fried tomato. As far as the eggs go, I got mine scrambled and they were perfectly cooked - I hate eating runny eggs so am always apprehensive about the state of my eggs - but these guys rocked it. Well, as much as you can rock scrambled eggs. Hot, moist, perfect. The fried tomato was also perfectly cooked and quite good. The sausage were dryer than sandpaper and hard, so I'm guessing they were sitting around for a while before they found their way into my plate. The English muffin was soft and fluffy, though bland, but the biggest disappointment were the potatoes. I mean, I had high hopes for these because they looked and smelled real good! Sadly, looks can be deceiving and these were not only undercooked but lacking in any real flavor. Bummer. I like a good patate with my breakfast. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious AND it had no pulp. I am not a fan of pulp.   Service: OK. Our table was visited by a variety of people and it was hard to keep track of who our 'official' waiter was. Granted, the place was busy due to the upcoming HABs game that was about to start. We were playing Boston - this is serious business!  Cost: Very decent - the meal was $8 and the OJ was $3.50. I was pretty well-fed for that price."}
{"text":"Montreal is rather lacking in good pubs, so the Burgundy Lion is a much appreciated spot to go for a casual dinner or pint with friends.  Decor is fun, with lots of British cultural references on the walls.  Food is usually reliably decent and they have a good selection of beers on tap and wine by the glass.  There's also an impressive list of whiskey if that's your thing.  Service is usually good but can get a little slow when they are busy."}
{"text":"Place has awesome reviews and I had just visited Atwater Market, so I decided to go here for breakfast. Waitress was awesome and very pleasant. Food wasn't as great. Food was a bit too greasy for my liking. Wish I had come here for lunch and not breakfast.   Pros: Great service!  Cons: Food is a bit greasy."}
{"text":"Went last summer got a salad with apples and blue cheese was pretty good.  We sat outside as it was a very hot summer day :)   Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé seulement une fois, pour la fête d'un ami.  C'était très sympa, l'endroit est agréable, grand et bien décoré, il y a beaucoup de monde, ambiance lumières tamisées. Le menu est assez complet, les prix sont raisonnables, le service était très bon A essayer!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Great pub grub! Awesome ambiance! I've been a couple times now trying something new everytime and I have never been disappointed! Staff is friendly and high energy!"}
{"text":"My sister brought me to The Burgundy Lion a British pub located in Little Burgundy for a lunch and beer.     Its a nice place it felt laid back. The waitresses and bartenders were dressed with red suspenders, I kinda felt bad for them, I guess it's the British theme?  I ordered the Cambridgeshire Salad- Grilled chicken salad, Stilton, pears, walnuts. It was good and had a lot going on a good portion too.  I got the Stella Artois on tap.    My sister got the Burgundy Fish & Chips. I thought the batter was crunchy and the fries were good.  She loved it and finished it All.      The terrace is nice here in the spring/summer.    I'de for sure come here again and taste more."}
{"text":"The thing I love most about brunching in Montreal is the variety you'll find in the restaurants and the unique offerings of places like the Burgundy Lion.   Admittedly, I'm a little biased towards anything that'll give me a nice cut of beef before noon, but their bubble & squeak is just one of the awesome offerings on their menu. Ranging from about $7 to $15, the prices are really reasonable and the food is well worth it.   If you're heading there during the week, the English-inspired lunches and dinners (including Indian curry dishes that add some extra English authenticity) are also a treat, with extra points to the chocolate-chip bread pudding for being CRAZY DELICIOUS (in all caps).   Adorned with posters for London events, cricket and football gear and photographs of Michael Caine and David Bowie to watch you while you eat, the decor is just as fabulous as the food. Service is great, too, but if there's a football game on, you might want to expect a wait or at least some very close quarters."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to go. Easy for lunch or for a quick pint on the way home."}
{"text":"Had a great salad and bites from a friends indian food something and it was ALL yummy.   We sat in their little inside  outside patio for a sunday lunch and had many beers. The service was very attentive and quick.  It was a really pleasant experience and if I was in the neighborhood, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Burgundy Lion makes the best poutine I have eaten up to this point in my life! The atmosphere is busy and the staff is awesome as it should be in a Pub."}
{"text":"Came here only once due to word from a friend that their fries are SO good. I was definitely not disappointed...I ordered only meals though. But the meals were delicious!! My boyfriend ordered a curry dish, it was a bit on the strong side (pretty spicy, not mild at all) and I ordered the portebello vegetarian burger. The mushroom was soft and chewy, the fries were simply heavenly! I love fries and this place makes pretty good fries. Not too greasy or thick but rather they are thin and still very potato-y. I'd definitely come back to try the beer. Service was really funny actually. Waiter was VERY attentive! Nothing wrong with that but he kept coming back to clear plates but my boyfriend wasn't finished yet! It was a few times that it happened. He apologized each time as well. It was funny. But service was friendly overall. Would come back again for a drink this time...and probably more fries!"}
{"text":"I came to the pub burgundy lion for the first time for brunch.  Walking in, the wooden decor and melange of art on the walls made a \"cool\" atmosphere. The place was spacious and we sat down comfortably inside. The pub also had an outside patio.  Before ordering, we decided to move outside to enjoy the sun, but there were certain seats that did not have shade. The waiter was patiently accommodating as we moved back inside.  I ordered the cornish chicken on couscous. The meal was plated beautifully and was delicious! Definitely recommend. After tax, my meal came to $20. Well worth for the quality.  My party whom had ordered burgers and fries were also complimentary of their meals.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place. Great food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Chaotic service. Bad, wobbly table. Good Scotch Eggs. Tasty tomato soup. Horrible Yorkshire stuffed with sausage. And if someone tells you it's their birthday you don't ignore it & not even make the slightest of gestures.  The eggs and the soup is what prevented me from giving this place a lower score, kudos to the kitchen at least (Yorkshire Pudding excluded from praise)."}
{"text":"Not impressed, by the food. This place seems like a great place to grab drinks, all with the immense scotch collection and the lively atmosphere. But when it comes to food I wasn't really impressed. Everything seemed a little muted. Probably would not be coming back."}
{"text":"Super noisy, totally fabulous pub with good drinks and tasty food. If you're not into having a deep conversation then I would definitely recommend this joint for a drink and a bite.   I had a couple of Caesars the last time I was there, as well as the Burgundy Lion sandwich and I couldn't have been happier. Sometimes it's the simple pleasures in life that are most important, and this would satisfy on that count."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends, young crowd. Great burgers principally the Burgundy Lion, my favorite... but even if they close late, their kitchen does not..."}
{"text":"I'm not one to judge pub food, because I don't eat it often. However, I am more than displeased with the food I ate at Burgundy Lion. I lie crouched in my bed right now suffering from a stomach ache, which was not there before I ate at B.L. It's sad, because I was really looking forward to eating at this place with friends; but between the lousy service and day old meal, I was ready to leave. The servers accidentally elbowed me in the head too many times; they forgot to put the order in for brussel sprouts and bacon, so I waited more than an hour for my meal; the fries were stale, the gravy was rancid, the codfish cakes tasted as if they were frozen like they thawed them in the deep fryer, and I think the sausage role is the reason why I'm in this state. The only thing worth getting is the house beer and don't get me started on how dry the Angus burger is. I was with a friend who is a burger fanatic and she was not touching that thing! The worst part is that you're paying so much for a meal that you didn't even enjoy. I've had meals at five star restaurants in Spain that were cheaper than this joint. Overall, this place is overrated and overpriced! Go at your own risk!"}
{"text":"A good place for drinks or food. Have been here dozens of times for both.  The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is good. Menu was recently updated and still has a lot of good food. My favourite is usually the colonial chicken.  Haven't had a bad meal here. It's a great section of town to eat or drink because there are so many options.  This is definitely a great spot"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch joint, especially if you're a football fan as they have viewing parties. Service is lovely, food is delicious, prices are reasonable- check it out."}
{"text":"I'm not too seasoned with places in Montreal, but this place did it's job! Good food in a nice pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of girls to watch the royal wedding, while in Montreal for a bachelorette party. Everything was set up perfectly - tea and coffee in adorable cups, traditional English breakfast, high tea...it was all lovely! We had a great time watching the wedding, and enjoying some English treats (and champagne)!"}
{"text":"Loved it here.  Would absolutely go back. Had a great burger and my gf had a great vege burger. Cocktails were also good!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had the English Toast with sausage. One of the softest French toast I ever had and the service was just amazing!"}
{"text":"Not bad a place but not a great place either. The room is warm, people somewhat friendly but nothing special... Especially the service that a found to be somewhat lacking.  Good place for friends and talk but for that I think you can find better... for example, les soeurs grises in old Montréal. More confortable, better service for around the same price."}
{"text":"Très beau pub british. Bon choix de bières et de bouffe: Fish 'n' chips pas mal bon, sans parler de la poutine! Mon plat préféré est la salade, étonnement. Il y a du bleu dedans, mais je demande toujours de changer pour du cheddar.   Bonne place pour souper et ensuite rester prendre quelques bières. C'est le spot le plus intéressant de la rue Notre-Dame dans le coin."}
{"text":"A great English-style pub in a the heart of the up-and-coming Little Burgundy. Good beer, good service, nice atmosphere and great pub food.  If you're in the food for a tasty pub mean and Guinness, try out Little Burgundy."}
{"text":"Went to joe beef first and no place to sit, then we saw this burger place across the street. It's a English pub but offers great selection of food. We ordered the shepherd's pie and banger & mash. The pie was good, but the mashed potatoes was too dry. Then we had some ice cream for dessert and it's just like the ice cream you buy from a grocery store, nothing special.  Waiters were nice, but takes too long for them to take the orders."}
{"text":"I popped in here  for my last night in Canada and it was brilliant!!*  It seemed like a normal British pub to me...just with different beers and more waitresses (so you don't have to order everything at the bar).   We ordered looooads of the starters to share (they were all yummy) and then I had the Cambridge salad for my main (as one of my friends recommended it - she was right, it was lovely!) If this was in the UK, we'd call it a gastro pub as the food was really good. I'm afraid I can't be more descriptive as my friends are all better drinkers than me so I can't remember all the details of the evening. I DO remember having an awesome time and being really happy...so this must be a good place to visit!    *The less brilliant part was my hangover which I got to bring with me on the journey home to the UK. Oops."}
{"text":"Located south of downtown Montreal in Saint-Henri, this two-floor English pub is a wonderful little establishment which serves microbrews and some pretty tasty food.   Let me just start by saying that to Quebec can brew some pretty tasty beer. I would know, I down three pints of this wonderful Blanche De Chambly, a wheat beer brewed locally. It was wonderful, I was in heaven. Add to that a very tasty bleu cheese poutine which I had along with an order of vegetarian samosa and I pretty downed about 10,000 calories in one sitting. Ok, maybe not that many but just don't tell my personal trainer at the gym. The poutine was wonderful and the blue cheese added a  whole new array of flavors to this guilty, unhealthy but yet too-delicious to avoid dish that is poutine.  The prices were good, the service friendly although they weren't been very nice when we asked them if they could turn on the television on our floor so we could watch game six of the NHL playoffs. Eventually they did and EVERYONE was watching. I don't understand why they we not cooperating about it in the first place... A neat establishment, I had a good time."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance. Le service était correct dans l'ensemble. C'est un excellent rapport qualité-prix.  C'est presque impossible d'avoir faim en sortant de là. Ils pourraient faire un effort sur le choix de bière. .."}
{"text":"Bad food, horrible service. A steady decline over several years.   I once gave this place 5 stars!!!! After last night I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The Burgundy Lion is one of my favourite hangouts/pubs in all of Montreal. It is a great place for any type of occasion, whether it's a night out with some friends, an intimate date, or just a place to enjoy a pint after work.  The menu can be hit or miss depending on your tastes. I have not tried everything, but the steak/frites is good as well as the fish and chips. Some of the starters are really good as well. If you're a fan of beer, their in house made burgundy lion beer is quite good as well.  If you're looking for a nice pub and are used to hanging out at places like McLaen's or McKibbons downtown, then this you will definitely enjoy this place as I consider it a step up from the \"traditional\" Montreal pub."}
{"text":"This is one of my Montreal favourites folks.    It's a fabulous British pub just a few steps from Atwater market and the Lachine Canal.  Fun food, fun atmosphere and great pub drinks with a very imaginative cocktail menu that changes to suit the occasion or season.     They got this place right!  But it can be tough to find a seat if there is a special event or occasion to celebrate.   If you are antiquing in the ridiculously priced shops on Notre Dame, or perusing the Atwater market or hanging by the canal...this is a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Sir Francis' Toast is the best French toast I've ever put in my mouth. Thick slices of caramelized bread with a sweet rum sauce and warm stewed apples. It was just perfect."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a few drinks and a late snack on our trip to Montreal. It was 9:30pm on a Tuesday and a decent size crowd were enjoying themselves when we arrived. The service was quick and friendly. Drinks were delicious. I had 2 cocktails and my boyfriend tried 2 different draft beers and we loved everything we bought! We had such a great time that we went back again the next day for lunch. I continued to explore the menu by ordering 2 other cocktails along with fish and chips. My boyfriend stayed on the same path, trying a few more of their drafts beers and eating the roast beef sandwich. We reluctantly left after enjoying our 2 hour lunch."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the finals of the Wimbledon, just last Sunday. We called a few hours before and we were able to get some prime seats on the patio out back, which was beautiful and cozy! I loved that they had a screen on the patio, as usually most people watch sports inside, and we re able to enjoy the weather on a gorgeous Sunday morning!   +1 Amazing back patio to watch sports on. +1 Great phone service to make a reservation last minute. +1 Had a breakfast menu and lunch menu to satisfy a craving +1 The burger I had was great, perfectly cooked +1 French toast was on point, and the bacon was delicious +1 Alcohol selection was good, but QUITE EXPENSIVE!  -1 The breakfast menu.... minus the french toast, everything looked the same, absolutely no variation. I was looking for something a little more varied and unique, the menu can definitely be worked on. Every dish need not have been eggs, with bacon with potatoes, most of the dishes was a variation of those three things.  -1 My cousin got a drink, and it was god-awful, we have never asked to return a drink, but we politely asked the server and she blatantly said no. There goes an $9 drink. Although this was sucky, the rest of the service was ok so I won't make a ruckus about it. Putting on my nice face.  -1 Brunch is my favorite meal, and they kind of ruined it for me with their lack of variation. Ended up cheating on brunch with a lunch menu, saddest day of my life.  -1 Service - WAS SO SLOW.... we weren't too bothered because we were watching the tennis match, but any other day and it would have been painful to sit through. At the end, we actually got up and paid the bill at the bar because it was just taking too long. I would skip this place during peak hours, because the service is a bit painful to get through.   Overall didn't hate the place, so I would rate it 3.2 stars, but because we were able to really enjoy the patio and the match I'll give it an extra 0.8th of a star. There you go 4 stars as you will. Over and out."}
{"text":"Pour l'amateur que je suis de fast-food de qualité, de bonnes bières et de scotch, ce pub d'inspiration anglaise est un véritable paradis. Aussi, malgré j'aurais aimé goûté au Fish and Chips de l'établissement, je n'ai pu résister à la tentation de commander le Burgundy Burger, qui en coutait 13 $. Accompagné de chips maison, ce burger bien juteux, plutôt traditionnel, ne m'a pas déçu, sans m'avoir étonné. J'ai accompagné le tout d'une Newcastle, une bière brune anglais tout particulièrement douce. J'ai vraiment adoré mon repas et je crois que l'ambiance, auquel a sans doute contribué le décor et le mobilier fait de bois. Le service était très bien, quoiqu'un peu lent... Bref, j'y retournerai sans faute et, la prochaine fois, j'ai la ferme intention de commander un ou deux whisky âgé..."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, good beer, okay food."}
{"text":"I used to live close by and would frequent Burgundy a lot. Love the food and the atmosphere. The place is almost always busy and it attracts a great crowd. One of the best / coolest pubs in Montreal."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. One of the waiters came by twice to move the table two down from us half an inch to the right. Couldn't be bothered to actually serve customers. Can't comment on the food, we left after 15 minutes without even having a drink order taken. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, happy staff and pretty good food. I can't ask for much more.  I came here to have dinner with my cousin, whom I haven't seen in months. Caught up over some good food.  I started with the cod fish cakes, crispy on the outside, soft in the inside. It was good, however a tad bit salty for my liking.  For the main, I went with the burger. It's good but I've had better, I'd go for the fish and chips next time, they looked good!  As for dessert...you gotta try the sticky toffee pudding that was recommended by my waitress. She was on the money, if you have a sweet tooth, try it!  I'll definitely come by again, it's just a matter of time."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and I am very impressed. I went for the Ploughman's Lunch $14 and Boddington's Pub Ale. Fantastic flavors, simply done. The vegetables did Canada proud, with a slight marinade, all had a distinct character. Pecans, boiled egg , relish (house) and grilled toast sided along with the pork loin slices.  July 26 I returned to the Lion on a very warm afternoon for a bite. I went for their version of a roast  beef sandwich with tasty bread, house chips (not French fries), pickle, salad and beer. It was way too hot to sit out in front since the umbrella'd tables were taken. As other reviewers mentioned, some of the  beautiful people hanging outside were as hot as the 104° indexed temp. Open for lunch and a few blocks from the magnificent Atwater Market, a great place to plan for lunch stop when in the area. With Joe Beef and Liverpool House across the street but open evenings only, the area stays hot into the evening, but check this place out for lunch, too.."}
{"text":"Toujours bien rempli, on ne manque jamais d'ambiance au Burgundy Lion! Belle sélection de whiskeys, staff chill, prix abordables et beau monde, c'est un excellent bar dans lequel se retrouver si on veux se sentir comme dans un bon vieux party de maison. Et côté menu? Ils ont l'affaire! Rôti de boeuf, poutine, crab cakes, fish 'n chips...Les plats sont goûteux, copieux et à bon marché. Bref, tout ce que tu voudrais retrouver sur un menu de pub anglais!"}

Prices are sometimes a bit exaggerated and sometimes gets so busy there's a lil line up which are the only reasons I knocked a star off.   Will keep on comin back!"}
{"text":"Being a resident of St-Henri, this pub is definitely different from some of the local pubs in this area: it's vibrant, has 20-30 somethings that enjoy a brew here, and it's packed on friday and saturday nights. That being said, sometimes I do find it too overcrowded and difficult to find a place to sit or stand and for that, I have to give it a 3 star rating.   Many of my friends who also live in the area like to come here after a hockey game, or birthdays are often celebrated here. It has a definite casual feel to it, and everyone tends to give off a good vibe. The staff is super friendly, but on busy nights, it's easy to feel a tiny bit neglected.  I've tried many different types of food here, but by far I recommend the Portabella Mushroom Burger. It's filling, not soggy and tons of mushroom goodness! I'd even go as far as to say that it is the best portabella mushroom burger I've ever had (and I have had plenty!) Another favourite of mine is the stilton pear and walnut salad. Their pub fare is definitely a cut above most."}
{"text":"Great, fast service, pretty-good coffee, delicious breakfast spot. Bar looked awesome, hope to try it again on my future trips here."}
{"text":"Venu pour la poutine week mais aussi en d'autre occasion (plutôt pour boire un verre) je n'avais pas encore fait de review. Les portions sont toujours en bonne quantité, les frites sont bonnes. Pour la poutine week leur poutine était vraiment cool, pas assez de recul sur les autres plats. De manière générale c'est des plats de pub mais bien servis. Au niveau des bières il y a un bon choix même si je préfère les micro québecoises que celles servis dans les pubs. Un inconvénient est bien sur le bruit (welcome in Montreal ...) et parfois le service peut tarder. Que cela soit pour manger rapidement ou regarder un match de sport avec un bière je vous le recommanderais !"}
{"text":"J'étais affamée donc j'ai commandé un poulet colonial aka tikka masala servi avec riz basmati, pain naan et yogourt.   La commande est arrivée très rapidement malgré notre grand groupe. La présentation de mon plat était belle et le goût savoureux; riz bien cuit, poulet tendre, sauce pas trop épicée, yogourt bien frais.  La portion est grande, remplie bien.   L'ambiance est bonne avec une lumière bien tamisée, musique, jeu de trivia au deuxième étage et beaucoup de gens sur place même un lundi soir! C'est un pub comme on les aime.   Le service est rapide, agréable.Notre serveuse Soad était très efficace et accommodante."}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss, the ambiance is great with friendly atmosphere and staff.  The inner outside terrace is ordinary however, and if you are not an old fashioned ham lover, stay away from it at brunch.  I recommend for evenings in groups where you want to have fun and enjoy the moment, with OK food."}
{"text":"Good food, not great, but service that, in our case was not very good: inaccurate and very slow. When our meals did finally arrive, it was tepid, no longer hot, as if it had been sitting for quite a while,  My veggie burger was ok but not very flavourful or substantial. French fries were excellent but room temperature by the time they showed up.  Spouse's steak arrived raw, not medium-rare as ordered, but this was quickly corrected and it tasted fine. Yorkshire pudding very dry and flavourless."}
{"text":"I had a reservation across the street for dinner and had arrived almost an hour early.  The Burgundy Lion was the perfect place!  The bar was completely full when I had arrived.  I waited a couple of minutes, pacing a bit to see if anyone might be leaving soon.  Why would they - this place is great.  After another moment checking out the place, I had noticed some traffic up and down the stairs in the center of the room.  Brilliantly I deducted that as will any respectable pub, if there is a bar on the first floor, there is another bar, albeit a bit smaller, upstairs as well.  Sure enough, there was, and just as fate would have it, one barstool open and waiting for me.    I sat down and ordered a Hendricks Martini, up.  The waitress immediately asked me if I would like that with a cucumber.  Impressive.  Not many know that Hendricks is cucumber and rose flavored as opposed to the more traditional juniper.  I agree to the cucumber and we're off.  The drink is prepared with perfection.  Moments later the bartender comes back over and asks me if the drink was made to my liking.  Again, I am impressed.  How often does this happen?  I tell her, it is really great.  Her reply - \"I know....it's because it was made with love\".  This place just keeps getting better and better.    My only regret was leaving, just in time to make my reservation across the street.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch as an alternative to the standard omelettes and pancakes. Very authentic style English breakfast, food is tasty and location is fantastic right in the heart of Notre Dame. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I make a point of sitting upstairs when I can since I enjoy the company of one of their newer bartenders (Aly with the short hair). The roast beef poutine seemed costly at first glance but was definitely worth the price tag considering it worked to fill two people. House Pale Ale is better than most home brews and the Angus Burger absolute stuffed me. The joint gets bonus points as most free pour locations earn ;). Props to waitress Sophie for always putting up with our shenanigans while flashing that smile. Nice to have a place where the staff know what they're talking about with their booze."}
{"text":"I love the open terrace in the middle of the place, it's heated and has a nice ambiance. The service is awesome and the staff is really friendly. The beer selection isn't so big but they have good cocktails as well. It's a perfect 5-7 place and the food is good."}
{"text":"Oh my god the brunch here is so good! You can get an actual english breakfast here! The \"full\" comes with two eggs, blood sausage (perfect crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth goodness), thick cut bacon, bubble and squeak (like a cabbage hash brown), beans, a roasted tomato with mushrooms, and a choice of crumpets, english muffin, or toast. They also have kippers if you're into that kind of thing. You get so much food and it's so good that it always breaks my heart when I can't finish it. They kept the coffee coming (a MUST) and the service was fast and friendly. Bigger and better than Sparrow on St. Laurent (the other brunch place that does English Breaky) and, although it's always been busy, I've never had to wait more than 5-10 min for a table.   Plus little burgundy-- the SW Montreal area it's in-- is so cool right now, and it's only a few blocks away from the Atwater Market. Couldn't ask for a better way to spend a Sunday. It's just too bad that all the antique shops that neighbor this place are closed on Sundays, but they do make for great window shopping. Just always a great experience."}
{"text":"An amazing service as soon as we got here. We wanted a place on the terrace and the maitre d made it happen for us in no time! What a great guy.... The food is just so very good, please come, worth every penny."}
{"text":"Tried the house ale, famous bangers and mash and a salad. The ale was very crisp, perfect for the summer time. I usually wouldn't order sausages but I decided to give it a try since it's the dish to try. I was pleasantly surprised by the bangers & mash, sausages were chunky and flavourful, mashed potatoes and gravy were fantastic too. The salad was ok...a little too generous with the blue cheese imo...overall a solid gastropub to come back to."}
{"text":"Came here for some brunch. Had the grilled cheese and it was super yummy. A great cosy place with friends especially with the cold outside. My friends had the Yank and it was quite good! This place is also a decent bar at night!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Scotch eggs were great and paired well with a side of breakfast mushrooms. Everything was a good value and I'm not sure why I haven't made it here sooner on my trip. Staff was so cute and nice. Other tables appeared to be indulging in delicious mimosas,I may be back soon to do the same."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff. Really enjoyed our office dinner here. Everything was served quickly.  No complaints here. A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Love Burgundy Lion.  Very limited gluten free options, but Colonial chicken is amazing, as long as you mention gluten allergy and no bread.  I go to Burgundly Lion way too often, its always fun, easy, great vibe and there are tons of things to do in the neighborhood (aka little fun shops to walk into)"}
{"text":"I was very well cared for tonight. I am a complete newcomer so the greeter's effort to get my watered and then fed was truly appreciated. All the wait people had good attitudes and the place was packed by 6 pm. Beer was good and food was generous and enjoyable. I have no trouble recommending the Burgundy Lion for a pint and some good pub food."}
{"text":"not the best beer selection but it was OK, the food was good but i was looking for a bit more."}
{"text":"This is a definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, although they serve some fantastic food! The second you walk in you will see the bar and to the left of that is a seating area for dine-ins. My girlfriend and I first ordered the English Poutine with Roast Beef and this thing was loaded! It was a pretty big serving and we couldn't believe how full we were after devouring this gravy-filled goodness!  My main course was the Lamb Shank special, which came with roasted potatoes. Unfortunately, I was pretty full from the Poutine and when the Lamb Shank came my appetite was shot, but still the lamb was really good. It was huge and very juicy. The roasted potatoes were well made as well, not too hard and seasoned excellently. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and it's definitely a good spot to hang out, grab a beer or just get a meal. The only criticism I would have is that there seemed to be a lack of TVs (just 1 TV) there if anyone wanted to come and watch a game along with grabbing a cold one."}
{"text":"TLDR: Fun pub with great beer and food.  Whenever I need a place to go in the south-west, I go to Burgundy Lion. It's a pub that you know you're going to have a good time. The beer selection is great, their cocktails are delicious, and the food is hearty and tasty.  I've gone there for both intimate and large gatherings and it's great for both. However, I do not recommend this pub for dates, because if you go on a busy evening there is no way you will be able to hear each other.   The servers are normally very friendly and attentive, with very few off days. However, you have to be empathetic when the crowd gets boisterous and loud.  Their brunch is also worth a visit, but remember that you will be having a proper English breakfast. If you think the veggie omelette will be a healthy choice, it's not as it oozes out cheese and is coated in butter. For the healthy version ask for it without dairy products, but don't be upset if it isn't as delicious!  Overall a fun and tasty pub to frequent."}
{"text":"Happenin bar. Place was packed on a Wednesday night. Only had some drinks here before dinner at Joe Beef. Lots of burgers were being sent out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"An old buddy Annie  has emergency called me and yelled through her phone. \"Dom you got to come over right now! There are a ton of hot ladies here! Comment followed by screams of women.  4.8 seconds later, I find myself at the Burgundy Lion pub.  I sat at the bar filled to capacity with men. Loads and loads of men ! I order a beer from a scruffy looking bartender , who ignores me and proceeds to poor a beer .  It turns out the beer was for himself. As I saw him sitting amongst the sea of men in the bar.  Aside from old Drink for himself Guy . The Burgundy may wanna work on mixing the Clientele Other than that, the beer was great  The food is making me hungry now!!"}
{"text":"There was a time Burgundy Lion was the only pub in a neighborhood that was just becoming hip. At this time we could get a table there without reservation on a Friday night. Nowadays it is hardly recommended to book a table if you want to visit in the evening even during the week. Today there are many more options to get a drink at Notre Dame street, but Burgundy Lion remains extremely popular regardless of  the competition.   There is a good reason for the love of the crowds, delicious food in the best tradition of the English pubs that has remained consistent as quality over the years, fulfilling brunches, and ah, oh these crazy cocktails I'm always tempted to try, but the beer choice is so good that it challenges your ability to finally pick a drink. Just a look at the whiskey bottles aligned at the bar brings warmth to your heart, wait to read the long menu, the choice of drink may become impossible.  Burgundy Lion is a Pub, what a LOVELY pub, bloody fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place and really had high hopes. I would have given it more stars but the service was effing horrendous. To the point where I almost got up and walked out. The waitress our table had (a small table of THREE girls) dropped off teh menu and avoided ALL EYE CONTACT for about an hour. She waited all the other tables around us and behind us and even BESIDE us but ours seemed to be an impossibility. After finally giving our order and getting our BOTCHED plates (I had ordered the beef poutine and got a regular one, which they still charged me $18), it took another 20 minutes to get ANOTHER waitress to our table to try and fix the mistake. All this and we haven't been able to place the drink orders because our waitress RAN AWAY after we gave our food order. The food itself was TO DIE FOR (once we got our full plates). The blue cheese and beef poutine is heavenly, the mayo they give you seems to be home-made and they burgers.... mmmmmmmmm. I wish i can give one rating for the service and another for the food. Going into a pub, i'm not looking for fantastic service however I'm not looking to go behind the bar and get my drinks either. I don't know if this woman was in her \"monthly\" time or what but let me tell you, she was unhappy with life and seemed to have a hatred for our table. This being said, AVOID the tall waitress with super short bleached hair because if she's in a bad mood, you'll leave there in a bad mood too but definitely go to try that poutine!!!! And the cucumber gin & tonic... Mmmmmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in Montreal. I travel frequently to this great city and eat at a wide variety of restaurants. I have always had good to excellent service. Until I happened upon the Burgendy Lion.   We were seated promptly, but sat for 15 minutes without a waiter. The host came to check on us. This initially appeared helpful, but he was in a terrible mood. He clearly wanted to take our order as quickly as possible and was very curt, bordering on rude. The water was warm and was dropped off too quickly to ask for ice.   The couple next to us for not fare much better. They had to get up and go to the bar to get another beer because they could not flag a waiter down.   I was so annoyed with the service, I was going to give 2 stars, but the bangers and mash were very good. The chicken salad was also tasty. So 3 stars.   Maybe they were short staffed and the host was just having a bad night..."}
{"text":"I did not partake in sampling their GINORMOUS scotch collection, next time better watch out Burgundy!  The Poutine week special with the rabbit meat (or was it duck meat) added an interesting twist to a classic. Had a random celebrity sighting (shook hands with Justin Trudeau) and merriment with friends was had.  If you are a scotch lover, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here since I came to Montreal last summer, though I kept hearing it was crowded and a bit pricey, plus being in Griffintown almost, I just never found the opportunity. Last Sunday night, I did. And we had a really good time.  It's basically just a really good, nice, modern pub. Huge whisky selection, and everything else. We were a group of 8, so we ordered all kinds of stuff. I had bites of samosa, Shephard's pie, green salad, scotch egg, and it was all just AMAZING. Also the drinks were strong, and the service was good.   Also, at first there wasn't a table, but we got a 4 seater, and grew it into an 8 seater within the hour. Also, I thought our check would be expensive, but it turned out pretty average to be honest. There are tons of MTL bars selling $8 pints that are super shitty compared to BL, which is nice.  I'll definitely return, and chances of going out of my way are higher."}
{"text":"It was by the luck of the draw that I even heard of this Brittish Pub in Montreal. I was listening at The Montreal Burger Reports' Podcast on Dilallo Burgers. Since the guys needed some hops to start off their review and Dilallo serves none they stopped by Burgundy Lion's Pub and linked to it in their podcast. I took one look at the pictures of their food and thought that if the food is only half as good as it looks I would be plenty satisfied. So off I went for some Pub Grub.  At first I was surprised by the look of the place. It's definitely not a dingy musty old pub. It's modern but still keeps an old England feel to it. Extremely clean and I can't say enough how much I love that. The place is crowded and had I known we could I would have made reservations but despite being packed, the service never forgot about us as we drank at a standing bar shelf. We struck gold and got seated in their tiny interior terrace which was a thing of beauty and had a Tardis on the second floor. The owner(s) definitely knows who to keep mens attention by picking the simplest yet sexiest outfit for the feminine section of his service team - the white camisole - it just works.  Sadly the service barely handed us the menu and asked us if we were ready to order. Slow down Nelly, we just got here and it's our first time. But she did make a valiant effort to speak French and after letting her trip and stumble for a few minutes we switched to English and began with the house chips, as in homemade Potato Chips. And seriously, I'm ruined. I don't know how I can ever eat a bag of chips after getting still warm, thick freshly fried potato chips served to me. This was a first for me and the first of many firsts for the evening to follow.  As starters we ordered the Scotch Egg and Cod Fish Cakes. The Cod Fish Cakes were something I had never tried before but wanted to. Fishcakes are made of - of course - fish and potato mash crusted and fried - yes fried; you just can't go wrong with fried. They served it with a tasty curry sauce. The fishcakes were quite peppery which contrary to my usual tastes, I quite enjoyed. My friend's starter was the Scotch Egg and I suddenly feel the need use a lot of expletives to describe how good this was. I had never heard of a Scotch Egg before and shall never forget it. This was the winning dish of the evening, for me anyway. A Scotch Egg consists of a shelled hard-boiled egg, wrapped in a pork mixture, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. Scotch eggs are commonly eaten cold, typically with salad and pickles but they served it with some kind of compote I didn't care for - the egg alone was just insanely awesome and will definitely be having it as my starter at my next visit - because there will be a next visit.  Now for the main course I hit the Sunday Roast, a British classic it seems and foolishly I wanted it because I had to try the Yorkshire Pudding. This was a mistake on my part. Been dying to have a Yorkshire Pudding and sadly I was somewhat disappointed; it tasted like a pancake in the form of a muffin - well I tried. But let's get to that roast, oh baby. I could pull it apart with my fork. It was perfectly seasoned and had this crust on the outside that was bursting with flavor. It also had two sides of veggies and this is where it gets weird. It had a side of beyond delicious roasted roots - including potatoes - and all were perfectly sweet and flavorful from - hopefully - roasting alongside the succulent Angus beef I was eating. And then another side of potatoes, this side is mashed. Sadly it was dryer than the British sense of humor and I fail to see why I needed mashed potatoes when I already had roasted potatoes right next to it. The mash was horrible and the roasted root veg were awesome. I would have gone mad with delight having simply more roasted veggies. The peppered gravy supplied for the Roast and the Pudding was lukewarm. I should have simply complained about this but I did not for some strange reason. There was also some horseradish sauce of which I did not partake because I have no taste for it. But as a whole the dish was great, I consider the superfluous mash a minor faux-pas.  For desert I had the Raspberry Trifle. It was kind of a disaster, thankfully I don't go to pubs for desert but on my first run at a restaurant I go through everything. The custard was liquid and bland. The sponge cake was rock hard - not even soaking up the liquid custard - and the raspberry coulis was way too sweet. The whipped cream was delicious.  As a final review, the upscale pub grub was overall a hit for me. Fresh Chips, both starters and the main were fantastic with the exception of a few missteps and a seriously troubled trifle I cannot under good judgment give it anything less than a 4 out of 5 stars. I'm already dying to go back."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, No stress if you want to catch a game, plenty of TV's over there."}
{"text":"I was staying nearby for a work thing, and I popped in to get some takeout. It was pretty full, but there was room to sit at the bar.   I ordered the portobello mushroom burger, which was the only vegetarian thing on the menu that seemed 'comfort foodish, to me' which is what I was craving. It took about 15 minutes so I ordered a martini at the bar - it was VERY good and the staff were fun to chat with.   I ate the burger in my AirBNB and it was HEAVEN! Just the best burger ever. The fries came with some sort of (miso?) gravy that I still dream about. I'm not even a big gravy fan!   EAT THIS BURGER, CHANGE YOUR LIFE."}
{"text":"Great pub in the area. The place is huge and so the service suffers as a result, but in the terms of pub fare, grub and booze, this place is solid."}
{"text":"The Lion is my favourite pub here in Montreal. Not only is it a solid English-style pub (which is OBVIOUSLY not as good as Australian pubs, but close enough), it's also the closest to my 'hood, and a great local to have.  The food is good here, and my personal favourite is the BL sandwich  - it's packed with ridiculous amount of rare roast beef, and comes with crisps. I've never once felt less than absolutely stuffed after eating one. Wash it down with a pint of the house larger, and you're set for an afternoon of drinking...  The scotch selection here is VERY impressive. It's one of the best in town, which while not what I'd expect from a \"ye olde pub\", is a very nice surprise.  While there's not a lot of TV screens, there are enough to catch the sporting event of your choice. The upstairs area has some big tables for groups, and there's a contained outside area for when the nice weather returns - I'm not sure if smokers can smoke in there."}
{"text":"Overrated brunch. I shared 2 dishes: the scotch eggs and the full monty, which is a combination of all the options for breakfast. It wasn't really tasty or that memorable."}
{"text":"The Burgundy Lion is a bit of a classic; a healthy blend of class and comfort, stability and fun. Although it is well known among Montrealers, I still thought it deserved to add another positive review to their collection, a review that I am now writing.   The pub located on Notre-Dame Street opens late and serves food until 11 PM (definitely a plus for night owl like my husband and I). They've got a good selection of appetizers and good main courses too. Being vegetarians, we usually go for the samosas or seasonal vegetables as an entree, and their veggie burger as a main dish. The veggie patty is soft and seems to be made of lentils and beans as far as I can tell. Taste-wise it's pretty good, though if I had a suggestion to make it would be to add chili or some other spice to enhance the flavor which currently is a bit tame.   Their deserts are also pretty decent; the blueberry and the rhubarb pies are both nice.   They've got a huge selection of whiskeys; over 500 according to their menu. Adventurous drinkers will most likely enjoy this feature. They also carry beer on tap, cider, wines and cocktails. They make a mean Irish coffee too (and by that I mean good and strong.)  While The Burgundy Lion fills up very quickly on weekends, weekdays are usually a good time to go if you're looking for some intimacy and a manageable noise level. Every time my husband and I have been, we've had a flawless service whether the room was packed or not.   I recommend The Burgundy Lion without hesitation; they deserve their good reputation."}
{"text":"The lion is my living room away from home! I really like this place, it's a nice place to meet friends for a beer after work or to watch the game.  I like sitting upstairs, I find it a little less crowded and  the downstairs bar has a tendency to feel like you're standing in a hallway but that being said it's still far and away the best place to have a beer in the neighborhood.  The lion is also one of my favorite places to grab a bite  I would say everything on the menu is pretty good, other then the fish and chips and the burger which are awesome, everything else is good and I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.   The service has always been good the wait staff always very nice and ready with a suggestion on what's good to eat or what type of beer to drink. The system of waiters, waitresses and busboys ensures that you get good service even when they're packed on Friday and Saturday nights.   The decor has modern pub written all over it, with all sorts of faux British decorations all over the walls. The first floor layout is a little odd if you want to stand at the bar since you will be in the space that serves as the hallway that leads to the back of the pub but upstairs is great and if given a choice I enjoy sitting up there.   The only caution I would give, is that if you're looking to have a quiet dinner where you can have a conversation with your dinner companion this may not be the greatest place. It tends to get very noisy in the evening, making conversation difficult without yelling. Drop in on a game night for a beer I know you'll be sold too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner tonight with our puppy Austyn and sat on the patio, which was great! They brought us a cute little plastic bowl for him to have water and were extremely accommodating, The manager who I didn't get his name was very nice and our waitress Taylor was very on top of everything and very friendly. the food was really good. I had fish and chips with mashed peas. (ohmygod!) and my boyfriend had the burgundy ribs with mashed potato. we'd gone a couple months ago for breakfast, it was a very classic British breakfast (not my thing, however my boyfriend loved it!) Overall a great place any time of day!"}
{"text":"Fun place to be! Take a pint, grab a snack, have an incredible dinner, watch the Canadiens, date night, or all of it!   Pros: cute girls in suspenders, over 200 whiskey choices, knowledgeable staff, great food, fun environment, wifi Cons: dinner for two is around $80, no parking, loud during game nights"}
{"text":"Cadre agréable mais beaucoup trop bruyant -impossible d'entendre la serveuse!!Du coup ,les gens hurlent entre eux à chaque table!Résultat,brouhaha garanti. Le Geordie's Catch(filet de saumon) était savoureux mais la portion assez petite par rapport au Welshman's bride ou l'Angus burger bien plus copieux.  Le crumble fraise rhubarbe était excellent Globalement cuisine de qualité avec un bon rapport qualité/prix Je recommande ce restaurant ....mais un peu moins bruyant !!!(j'aurai rajouté une étoile au moins...)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty lovely. This is especially the case given that I'm a Scotch monster and this place literally has the largest list in Canada. Some gems on there, especially in terms of Glengoyne 12 and 14 year casks - liquid gold. That said, the one app that I had (sausage rolls) lacked focus and was texturally problematic. Moreover, there were simply not enough servers given how busy the place was. Nevertheless, a great place for the Scotch lover."}
{"text":"This place is basically you're ideal neighborhood pub. It's super popular though, so not the bartenders are always busy, but they're skilled enough that I never felt deserted. The cocktail selection/execution is also pretty impressive. The menu is small, but they focus on doing a few things well. Its pretty loud inside, but you could easily carry on a conversation outside (weather permitting). If you're in the neighborhood looking for bustling bar with quality food and drinks check it out."}
{"text":"The Burgundy Lion is a well-known Montreal institution that I've never had the pleasure of going to. I opted for the fish'n'chips and ordered some pale ale. Both hit the spot real good... I was famished. The service was quick and efficient, considering we were a large group. I appreciated that! The noise level is pretty acceptable considering the number of people inside.   I'd come again."}
{"text":"Good spot for drinks and snacks after work. The fish and chips are amazing, and so is the (huge!) salad with blue cheese and grilled chicken. It's also a very good place for brunches!"}
{"text":"We visited the Burgundy Lion for lunch on a Tuesday. We arrived at 12 noon and already the pub was filling up.  Great interior, very similar to a British pub/bar in London. The choice of beers was excellent with Guinness, Boddingtons etc etc. Service was fast and the menu is slick and to the point. There wasn't pages and pages of dishes which is so off putting when you only have a short lunch break. Plenty of British traditions such as Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash, Ploughmans, and good old indian curry.   We ordered the Highland burger with french fries and also the Tikka Masala curry with naan bread. I was asked how I liked my burger cooked which was a surprise to hear for a lunchtime pub so after this question I expected a great burger. Much to say, I was very disappointed. The burger was tiny within a huge bun. It literally sat in the middle like a meatball while the bun remained soggy. It was difficult to pick up and fell apart. The meat was very dry, almost like it was reheated rather than freshly cooked. The tikka masala curry was also very dry, like it was cooked and then reheated in the microwave. There wasn't any moisture in the sauce at all more-so like curry paste stuck to the chicken.   I must say though the french fries that came with the burger were the best I had ever had and their homemade sauce was excellent.   However $45 for two lunch main dishes, a pint of Guinness and a panache was too much especially for the overly cooked and very dry food."}
{"text":"Retour vraiment réussi au Burgundy Lion. Beaucoup de plaisir. Scotch un peu cher mais vraiment respectable. Retour en l'occasion du 30ieme aniversaire d'un ami. Nous étions dans le meilleur coin du pub . Pas trop loin des toilettes, Dans un coin intime d'une belle banquette de 8-10 places. Très bon spot, pas trop bruyant et vraiment facile de se parler sans geuler comme des épais. On a eut du très bon service avec une gentille et jolie demoiselle avec une très belle grosse PERsonalité. Vraiment gentille et une fille qui ne nous a pas ignorer et qui revenait régulièrement. Le menu, simple, p-e 15-20 choix, rien de trop fancy. Beaucoup de spécialité indo-anglaise. Et selon plusieurs, le meilleur fish N' Chip. Personnellement, je dois dire que c'Est ex-eaquo avec Pied de Cochon mais bref, solide, ça fond dans la bouche, vraiment très bon avec des frites maisons. Pas cher, 16$. Bonne sélection de bière donc une bière maison, la BierBrier qui pour moi est vraiment bonne. C'est très anglo comme place, mais le monde nous sert en anglais, en français, en franglais. C'est vraiment un bon endroit où aller mais IL FAUT réserver ou aimer être debout. P-e que ça pourrait justement être un bon bar de transition ou pré-reservation du Joe Beef (juste en face)."}
{"text":"One of those places that's just bang on, from sun up to sun down. Whether you're waking up with a Saturday morning pint, kicking back with a Sunday afternoon pint, or unwinding with a weeknight pint, there's really nowhere better than Burgundy Lion.   Fancy yourself a bite? Whether you're waking up with a Saturday brunch, kicking back with a Sunday lunch or unwinding with a weeknight dinner, you guessed it... there's really nowhere better than Burgundy Lion."}
{"text":"Overall I really like this place but my one complaint is that the portions are way too big.  I had the bangers and mash which tasted really good.  I ended up leaving a big chunk of my food behind because I couldn't finish it.  Drinks-wise they have a good selection of beers and cocktails.  I had the cider which was pretty good.  It is a pretty popular place and was packed when I went so a reservation would be a good idea just to be sure you get in."}
{"text":"Rien d'extraordinaire ici, mais le personnel était courtois et de bons conseils !  Si j'y retourne ? Pour un 5@7, pourquoi pas !"}
{"text":"Just before hitting a concert in the Corona theatre, my friend and I decided to spike our blood alcohol content level just a bit. It didn't take long until we found Burgundy Lion as it is right next to the venue. We were there only for the drinks so our destination was the bar counter upstairs which was rather small but our bartender was marvelous. She kept a charming smile throughout our stay and was very knowledgeable. Our drinks were boozy and carefully crafted. My only disappointment was that my Negroni had this distinct taste that I recognize from dated sweet vermouth. Nonetheless, everything else was a perfect preparation for the concert."}
{"text":"Tried my first ever poutine here. It was cool and nice outside but inside the restaurant was so hot and humid. Service was.... like average NYC, you know. Poutine itself was good, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Beau pub anglais ! On se croirait à Londres pour ce qui est de la décoration et de l'ambiance, la bouffe est bonne ainsi que la bière. Le menu à l'air varié. Y'a une terrasse sur la rue Notre-Dame. Un des endroits les plus en vogue dans la Petite-Bourgogne. J'y retournerais pour sûr !"}
{"text":"The Lion, a Fish and a Dart Club       The Lion is a great spot to go for a good beer, a great scotch, a hot curry or some of the city's best Fish and Chips. I frequent the pub just about whenever I can and for the most part, the place always has a good crowd. For the day goers, there is a shady spot somewhere if you just want to have a pint and read a book or sit at the bar and watch a futball game.        They do a 'British plate of the week' which I have seen vary from salmon confit with hollandaise over mushroom risotto(British, really?) to braised beef cheek with roasted vegetable(ahhhh, British). Some of the best pub food I have ever had.        The quality of the food speaks volumes, I can confirm, having worked there as a cook, prior to my relocation to FLA. The chef is a great guy who runs a tight ship and the kitchen staff are very 'pirate like' in nature. Between the burley 'strong man,' Corey Cash, the scimitar wielding, beast carving, Marie Maude, Paul, the omnitasking grill man from Waterloo or the steadfast, starboard savvy sous-chef, Matt, the kitchen staff is top notch and pumps out food of equal, if not greater quality.   The staff, in general, is great. Nice, friendly people delivering quality food and sliding you good booze, down the bar. An awesome place to enjoy a Habs game, a local band or the Montreal flavour...you heard me, I said flavour.  wakawaka"}
{"text":"What to do when you are hungry and your are walking on a street full of restaurants?! Yelp it!!!!! Finally found this English pub with a good review and decided to stop by and try.    Pretty noisy for me (yeah, I know... I'm old), but they have a nice patio inside.  Such a nice ambience. They even have a booth for groups!   Cocktails are around 12$ each and my choice was a mojito style Pimms (an English liquor). MUST TRY. It comes with cucumber and mint. Delicious.   To start, Bully Beef Toast ($13) Corned beef on pain brioche, aged cheddar, sweet pepper mix. Oh boy!!! Awesome! The sweet pepper mix comes with sweet onion... The beef is just amazing.   My main course was an Angus Burger (16$) AAA Angus burger, cheddar cheese and house chips. What can go wrong with an AAA Angus?! The fries were delicious. I've just missed the mayo maison.   My partner's main course was the Cambridgeshire Salad (17$) Grilled chicken salad, Stilton, pears, walnuts. I can say it was hard for him to choose the salad, due to the all succulent options on the menu. But he is a super healthy man! ;)  Overall... I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"If you live near Little Burgundy, or are in the area you need to go here. I love the food, and the beer. The atmosphere, the music, everything is great.  Lunch, dinner, beers, dates, any occasion."}
{"text":"En étant au Burgundy Lion, je me suis ennuyée des pubs australiens et anglais que j'ai eu la chance de visiter lors de mes voyages. L'ambiance, le menu et la sélection de bières sont tous très biens et à des prix pas mal raisonnables pour la qualité et la quantité. J'ai essayé la bière Saint-Henri que j'ai adorée et qui a été déclarée comme étant la gagnante de la soirée. Mon chum et moi avons partagé le Ploughman's lunch puisqu'on ne voulait que quelques petites bouchées pour nous soutenir jusqu'au souper. Le mélange de fromages, pâtés et autres petites bouchées était super bien équilibré. À voir les autres assiettes des autres autour de nous, tout sur le menu avait l'air super bon, bien frais et plein de saveurs.  La seule chose qu'il manque pour faire de l'endroit un vrai pub à l'anglaise serait de laisser tomber le service aux tables, laisser les gens commander au bar et surtout, laisser les gens s'asseoir où ils veulent pour favoriser les nouvelles rencontres et ajouter un air de communauté à l'endroit. C'est peut-être bien différent et même gênant lorsqu'on se retrouve dans se genre de situation pour la première fois, mais pour moi, c'est l'un des éléments les plus importants d'un pub."}
{"text":"Great bar food.  Huge selection of drinks/cocktails.   Eye candy for the guys.  Or girls..."}
{"text":"What do you get when you go to an English pub in the middle of French Canada? Eh.... this place, I guess. I came here with a group and most everyone was at least semi satisfied with their food and drinks. They had a good Pimm's cup and their British poutine was pretty delicious. The shepherd's pie was mediocre. The desserts were on the dry side. Prices were a bit high... wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't avoid it either."}
{"text":"Went here with friends for a celebration, to have drinks and nibbles. They seated us at tiny tables (3) for a group of twenty people. They wouldn't let us move to tables to eat food. The weirdest and rudest thing is that they are so quick about you paying your bill immediately for what you order and then they take an hour to bring it to you. The service was so slow and the servers were very oblivious. Unfortunately, I ordered Lyle's Yorkshire pudding. Don't do what I did. This place does not know how to make pastries. It was burnt, I had to saw into it with my knife and the middle filling was burnt/cooked out. I was thinking about coming here for high tea. Nope, no thanks. I will stick to Le Cardinal."}
{"text":"Solid bar, great service, terrific Brit ambiance, excellent beers on draft and they are never, ever flat. Come for Monday night quiz night for some laughs and meet some cool/smart locals, but come any night for some of the tastiest pub grub that Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"After a light dinner elsewhere, I opted to dig into the cheeseburger here at Burgundy Lion. Great service at the bar, and while there's a full selection of spirits, the choices in beers are limited to macros only. It was a great pour of Murphy's, but I really can get Murphy's just about anywhere.  It's a little loud and the place does get rather busy and that's all great. Neat pub vibe and with TV's tuned to sports, a constant amount of cheering going on.  Inside and street seating too."}
{"text":"Amazing tomato soup (that is vegan). I will dream about it I think for a while until I have it again. The rest of the food I had was quite good, as well, but did I mention the tomato soup? :-P"}
{"text":"I adore this pub! Fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. Love Monday Trivia Nights and their food is amazing, though, a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I traditionally celebrate my birthday at pubs, and wanted to find a new one to do so this year. I had heard nothing but good things about the Burgundy Lion, and being relatively close to home, I thought I'd give it a try. I made reservations for a group of 10 with Toby, and hoped desperately that we were seated near a TV to catch the Habs game. Upon arrival, I was uber pleased to see he had seated us in a \"private\" nook in the back on the left-hand side on the first floor. It's a large table backed by a booth and finished off with chairs, and has its very own TV. I will admit, I put on a special happy dance once I discovered this.   The decor is quirky British pub style (mind you I've never been across the pond, so I can't say it's absolutely authentic).   The servers are friendly and knowledgeable on the selection of beer and food, and very attentive. And although the group grew from 10 to maybe about 15-16, our server was always welcoming of a new face, promptly asking them if they wanted a drink or something to eat. We requested to have them put the game sound on instead of the music, which they were happy to do (nice touch).   The beer selection is a good mix of European and Canadian; loving ever opportunity to try new beer, I opted for a couple of pints of Boddington (described as a cross between a blonde and a cream ale, very good!).   To start Danny and I shared the veggie samosas, which had a surprising kick to them; full of flavour and perfect portion size. I had been so excited for fish 'n' chips since I had made the reservations, and of course ordered them; Danny had the Colonial Chicken. The fish was so delicious; flaky and flavourful, and wasn't too battered, so there was a good fish to batter ratio. The fries were perfectly salted and had that desired crispy on the outside, soft on the inside thing going on. Danny, being a big fan of Asian/Southeast Asian cuisine (heck, he is Mauritian after all), had nothing but great things to say about the Colonial Chicken. I had a bite myself and thought it was delicious too. Overall, everyone in our party seemed to really enjoy the food, drinks and ambiance.   A side note, it is a little pricier than normal pub fare, but it definitely warrants it. I am a fan and will most definitely be back!"}

{"text":"Like the bar, don't like the food. It's mainly a bar so not a problem. Good selection of whiskeys - for Montreal. Have met nice folks there too. Often, the upstairs is quite quiet - which also works for low key meetings over drinks."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks! We decided to try the it for lunch. I had the fish and chips. They use cod; I love cod. The fish was fried in a thick batter; can't say it tasted anything. It was served with an interesting mashed green peas, a good tartar sauce and some great fries. My plate came cold...eating cold fish and chips isn't the best but I'm sure once hot it would have been a great lunch. The service was good!"}
{"text":"Deux convives sur trois insatisfaits: du jambon qui s'est révélé être un morceau de porc sec et élastique, un uf écossais tout aussi sec, un rôti de buf sec et réchauffé, des accompagnements douteux, service inexistant et peu courtois. Je ne reviendrai pas ici. Certainement pas pour déjeuner!"}
{"text":"So I've resisted any actual major to-dos at the Burgundy Lion for some time- this can be attributed to the abundant presence of smiley, child-wheeling blond and attractive 30-something Little Burgundy gentrifyers who seem to loiter outside the restaurant during prime brunch hours while they make their over-elaborate goodbyes to one another. All hating aside, these breeder brunchers and me have one major thing that makes us different: they're never hungover and child-free like I'm hungover and child-free during brunch.  I was really asked to up my game when my friend insisted on reserving a table last weekend. And it was lovely- there was a soft snow storm blowing outside keeping the place relatively quiet and the service was good. I had the English Toast with boudin. The crumpets, while great, could not compare with the boudin which was to die for. I don't know why I would eat anything else for breakfast.  The humble three stars can be attributed to the moment I looked up from the R-rated conversation about a wild weekend I was having with my friend to see a child no more than two starring at our animated table. I have pretty defined feelings about places that welcome young families and vulgar 20-somethings with breakfast cocktails, and then place them side-by-side. Booze and kids in the same place: it just ain't right, son."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour le brunch, un dimanche matin vers 10h30. Excellent service dès l'entrée, menu varié pour tous les goûts. Aucun stress pour les factures, comparativement à d'autres resto de brunch où les serveurs nous poussent vers la sortie dès la dernière bouchée avalée.  J'ai pris l'Alfred Scottish (si je me souviens bien), qui était très bon (quoi qu'un peut trop de sauce à mon goût, je la demanderai à part la prochaine fois). J'ai beaucoup aimé la salade avec les betteraves et radis, ça allège le plat autrement assez lourd. Mon ami a prit le Full English, les patates étaient absolument délicieuses et je regrette de ne pas en avoir demandé !"}
