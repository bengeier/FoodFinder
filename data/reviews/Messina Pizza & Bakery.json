{"text":"Driving around my neighborhood one day, and happened to see Messina Pizza & Bakery.  Wasn't expecting a pizza shop in this location.  I went in and ordered a small pepperoni pizza with mushrooms, onions and bell pepper.  The wait was about 10 mins.  The cook took my order and prepared it.  The pizza was so hot, I could hardly carry the box!  The cook was very nice and personable.  He shared interesting history about the near life-size photo of past residents of the area.  I have to say that the pizza was certainly, without question, one of the best I've had in a long time.  The crust is fresh and tastes like a dinner roll.  The toppings are also fresh, and not skimped on at all.  Once you eat one of these, you cannot go back to commercial franchise pizza chains! You get big hunks of your favorite toppings.  Then, there's the bakery!  You must visit this historic landmark and the folk at Messina.  It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This old neighborhood bakery has long withstood the waves of white flight and urban decay that have  decimated the area for decades.  That being said, the family remains steadfast in their commitment to quality baked goods, which rival any other Italian bakery in Cleveland.  The cannolis are especially savory, made fresh every day with a nice crisp she'll and sweet ricotta filling!  If you're near Collinwood, I highly suggest that you try this timeless classic!"}
{"text":"Pepperoni rolls are the best you will find period. Pizza is good, but just that. Still working on getting some of the great looking pastries though."}
{"text":"The phrase 'appearances can be deceiving' was made for this place.  The pizza?  Phenomenal.  Their bread?  Phenomenal.  One of the best little gems on the east side."}
{"text":"This place brings me back 30 years ago with pizza places were family run. Excellent pizza although I haven't tried the Bakery's yet I will be soon. One of my favorite places on the east side of Cleveland."}
