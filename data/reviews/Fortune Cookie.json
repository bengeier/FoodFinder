{"text":"Great Chinese food at a great price.  I especially like General Tsos Chicken with Lo Mein"}
{"text":"I have never been to the restaurant, but order delivery every 1-2 weeks!  Like any restaurant, some days are better than others.  If ordering spicy, it may vary a bit from day to day.    However, the portions, service, and price can't be beat in the area, at least in delivery food."}
{"text":"I've been ordering stuff from them since I moved here from San Francisco, CA.  Their Egg fu Young is unbeatable. I kept going back for more. They are fairly priced and the disposable containers the food came in, are sturdy.  You can tell they their hearts into packing your order. :) Your order comes with fortune cookies and lots of sauces. If you order in the early evening, service is speedy.  One time it was like 10 min and I live in the west outskirt of uptown"}
{"text":"We order from this location all of the time. However, this time I felt the customer service and the food was so on point, it wouldn't be fair for me to not give praises. I placed the order online. Although, the up-charge for white rice to fried rice was clearly stated on the site, they called to confirm before placing the order. The delivery guy was also very kind. The food was delicious; best pork fried rice and the hot wings...yum yum! We always order from Fortune Cookie off Kings and they will continue to be our go to for Chinese Food."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've reviewed a place on Yelp but I feel inclined to do so because of the terrible reviews of Fortune Cookie. I want to share of my recent positive experience to level the review field.   Positives: -The Crab Rangoon was the best that I've ever had from this kind of caliber of a Chinese restaurant ( meaning it's not buddakan in Nyc but just your average, city/town Chinese restaurant) they were crispy, creamy and very good!!!  -the sesame chicken sauce was very good (but unfortunately there wasn't enough sauce) there was a little at the bottom of the container and I tried to sponge up as much as I could. I would definitely order again and just ask for extra sauce.  -the beef and broccoli was pretty good. It's not the best but flavorful and a good portion.  -delivery was within 35 minutes from the time I ordered online to door. -the sweet little man that delivered my food stole my heart. Very nice service!   Cons: -definitely the lack of sauce as mentioned above on the sesame chicken so therefor the chicken seemed a bit dry and lacked but I would definitely order again and just ask for extra sauce.    Overall I was very happy with the food, service and delivery time! I don't often order from Chinese restaurants because it's hard to overlook the general feeling that it's usually not of high quality proteins (chicken, beef, etc.) but I was happy with the quality of the food tonight and again, the crab ragoons were to die for! :)   Hope this helps fellow readers to have a unbiased and better idea of what to expect from this restaurant, the negative and the positive!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite takeout Chinese restaurants.  I have been ordering takeout from the Fortune Cookie for the past 3-4 years and have always been pleased.  My favorite is the Hunan Chicken and the Sub-Gum Wonton soup which is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Do not support this business. The old owners (previously known as Wok Express) were professional, kind and always put the customer first. The new ownership and staff is a completely different story. They are unprofessional, do not value customer service and are disrespectful. The food has also changed and is not nearly as good as it was under the ownership of Wok Express. Unfortunate loss to this area."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out twice in the past 6 weeks from this place. Everything was consistent even the second time around. I have ordered beef & broccoli, fried rice, lo mein, general tso's chicken. This isnt gourmet food by any means. Just quick chinese food to satisfy your craving and not have to worry about cooking dinner kinda place. I live in elizabeth and use to get food from ho ho cherry house, but after reading some reviews of people getting sick i didnt want to chance it. So if you want some good chinese food and do not want to get food poisoning then head over to Fortune Cookie. P.S If you are not starving you could even split one of their combination dinner plates between two people. Just ordered a soup to go with it, and add on Lo Mein."}
{"text":"Awful take-out service. We waited 2 hours for an order and after it never showed up asked for a refund. Manager rudely hung up on us after weaving very obvious lies and refused to refund us for our (overpriced) meal."}
{"text":"Wow, always would have given this place 5 stars. Have been ordering delivery from them for years. I called tonight and ordered delivery with my usual, which always included a container of their wonderful homemade mustard. Tonight they told me they weren't providing that anymore. I don't know about you, but I'm not eating an egg roll with that packaged stuff."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese take out I've had in a long time.  I got the sesame chicken dinner combo. The chicken was overly breaded and very soggy.  The sesame sauce was bright red - as if they put the wrong sauce on my chicken and just threw some sesame seeds on top to make it look correct. I also had asked for brown rice, but they don't carry steamed brown rice.  It was very cheap - but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"i love this food . the crab ragoons are crazy good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town. Quick delivery, great service, great price."}
{"text":"Best delivery chinese Ive had in charlotte so far. Ive ordered from them 5 times in four months. good portions. good firecracker shrimp, mandrin chicken, mixed vegetable, hot n sour, fried dumplings, and good lo mein."}
{"text":"We ordered for pick up pretty late at night. The food was ready quickly and tasted good. I had the chicken lo mein and girlfriend had shrimp fried rice. The taste could have been a little better but it was still good for the price."}
{"text":"I order from here weekly. Food is always as ordered always fresh, fast delivery if you live uptown,delivers in less than 20 minutes I give the quality of the food 3 1/2 -4 stars . Some Dishes are lacking in flavor but you get  lots of food for the lunch combo special"}
{"text":"Surprisingly satisfying Chinese comfort food.   I was at a business meeting at the Sheraton and needed a Chinese food fix.  The Fortune Cookie was in walking distance so off I went.  The menu has a wide variety of combinations.  I went with the Sweet and Sour Chicken and paid a modest upcharge for pork fried rice as the accompaniment.  The rice was awesome with the roast pork bordered with the red glaze so common in the Northeast but increasingly rare elsewhere.  There was a nice smokey flavor as well.  The Chicken which I ate without the sauce was crisp on the outside and tender inside.  Nice!  I walked back to Uptown on the wonderful nearby hike and bike path to offset my satiated stomach."}
{"text":"Well what is to be said about this place, for starter in just moving into Charlotte many of my coworkers and friends have recommend this place saying its some of the best Chinese food in town. As a food Connoisseur I enjoy Chinese food a lot but upon having high hope for finding a new place to enjoy some delicious cuisine the lack luster effort has seized to impress my expectations. The quality of the food has ranged from okay to mediocre, while the portions range can differ upon a full meal for an adult to \"emergency rations\" that in turn causes the meal to become inconsistent and make not worth it's full price. It also seems that the cook doesn't put care into his work often times making the experience to be a let down and it seems to be the same at the all of the locations. My final verdict is poor, this place has a lot of work for improvement."}
{"text":"Fortune Cookie is really tasty, and they give sizable portions of food! This is one of the best takeout spots in town!"}
{"text":"Yum! I've lived in the neighborhood for a decade and have been ordering from a competitor in total ignorance/forgetfullness of what Chinese food is supposed to be. These guys made me love Chinese food again. Their competitor, whose name might begin with something Santa might say, was just awful food, and getting worse every day. I was like a battered wife, just hoping this time ordering would be different. I'm actually glad to be recovering from the flu and didn't feel like going out. I've found my new best friends from China. The order was identical to my 'usual' but had larger portions and actually cost less. The flavor was unbelievably better."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Got take out through foodie call and it tasted old and dirty. Barely could get it in my mouth! Wish I didn't spend $25 on food I didn't even eat! Do not eat here."}
{"text":"You can't beat their lunch special.  We walk over from CPCC a lot for lunch & it's cheap, tasty & you get quite a bit of food.    Be warned, if you order the entree dinner size, it's more than enough to feed 2 people!  We made the mistake of ordering 2 dinner sized entrees one night & had enough for 2 more meals.  Their beef & broccoli is delicious!"}
{"text":"Their prices are reasonable & they deliver. Also the delivery service was quite fast. The food was where things started declining. The spring roll was fine, probably came from a box, but whatever. Crab Rangoon was terrible. For $3.75 I know they'll be using imitation crab..thats not really my beef..they were pretty flavorless except for the onion. Also ordered beef & mixed vegetable, meh. They're certainly generous with their portions. But quality & flavor could seriously improve. Will I order again? Yes, but thats just do to laziness."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Chinese food!  Usually get take out from here--I love their fried dumplings and chicken and broccoli.  Convenient location across from CPCC's IT building.  Sometimes parking is kind of an issue during busy periods, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place!  Everything has great flavor, is hot and fresh.  I always get a different rice--shrimp, beef, house, and veggies with extra egg.  So great to be such a small place and the prices rock as well.  I had the spareribs as well and let me tell y'all something--Fortune Cookie puts an extra spin on them that make them addictive!  Go in for the service, leave out with your food, love your tummy when you get home.  Yes, four stars and I am all over this place whenever I get the hankering for Asian food.  And they are so nice!  When I call to order for carryout they listen well and read back everything.  After two orders, he said 'Blake?'  Yes ma'am!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese takeout joint.  I live around the corner from Ho-Ho Cherry House in Elizabeth, but choose to drive the extra mile or so down the street to come to Fortune Cookie.  I have never had a bad experience and have ordered at least 15+ meals from here.  They are quick, always get my order correct, portions are beyond generous (I can get 2 meals out of a dinner combo), prices are very reasonable, and it's always delicious.  When I'm craving Chinese, there's no doubt where I'm ordering from."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here for years. Unfortunately I believe they now have more business than they can handle, most likely from CPCC. We are told a 30 min. delivery time & the last 3 deliveries it has been 1hr and 45 mn. the last being n a Wed. night. Always blamed on the driver."}
{"text":"Fortune Cookie is my go-to place for delivery Chinese. I have not found better fast-food Chinese in Charlotte and it is some of the best I have had in my life. The delivery guy and girl are both always extremely friendly. They make it clear that they remember us and appreciate our business.  Our go to is the Honey Chicken. It is perfectly crispy and the sauce is delicious. The steamed dumpling appetizer is also great as are the soups (egg drop, hot and sour). The chicken wings are great! I highly recommend those even though they aren't very \"Chinese\". They have a really easy online ordering website to make it easier than calling in an order. Food always shows up hot!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and tastes good.  Great dive spot for Chinese.  No ambience, but the staff is really nice and the food is good.  If you're looking for a takeout spot this place is a solid choice.  Crab Rangoon: 5 Hot and Sour Soup: 5 Sesame chicken: 4 Sweet and sour chicken: 4"}
{"text":"Very good delicious . Nice service fresh ingredients. Fair price. Good portions. Downtown Dan"}
{"text":"Chinese food that delivers in Dowtown Charlotte and is decent. Of course nothing compared to San Francisco but for Charlotte a good value. Tangerine Chicken was really good"}
{"text":"Although I order take-out or delivery from here almost once a week, I really don't know much about the menu or the service inside Fortune Cookie.  I CAN say that every time I've ordered delivery or take-out, my order has always been correct and I have always received my food in a timely manner.    I always get the same thing - Sesame Chicken with fried Rice ($9.55).  I've had their white rice and to me, it just lacks flavor, so I always go with the fried rice.  The Sesame Chicken always comes with a plethora of chicken, drenched in their sweet and yummy sesame sauce.  The chicken is always good, but never great - as sometimes the chicken can be a little dry and chewy as if its been cooking too long, but this is the exception and not the norm at Fortune Cookie.    For me, its hard to find a decent Chinese spot that my stomach and mind both feel comfortable indulging in without worry of sickness or health code violations.  With Fortune Cookie however, I think my mind and tummy can rest easy knowing I've found the perfect combination of quality food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I am a huge fan of their quick fast and efficient delivery service.    I usually run the Sesame Chicken with fried rice.  Because there is a delivery minimum, I usually get two smalls. I like that the Sesame Chicken comes with ample sauce and the chicken is usually cooked to my liking.  Although you might be well served to ask for the chicken cooked crispy as my buddy usually does.  The fried rice is always consistent and is the perfect complement to the sweet chicken.  Though I've tasted the egg roll many times, I am not a fan, not because there's anything wrong with them, just because I don't like egg rolls in general.    The delivery component is usually pretty straight as well.  The delivery guy is usually there with my food pipping hot within 10 min of ordering.  There have some serious Jimmy John's speed going on with their delivery.  The delivery driver has always been friendly and polite.    So why am I not giving fortune cookie 5 stars?  The answer is simple, I can't award Fortune Cookie 5 stars, because I've been in the actual establishment within the past month and they had a sanitation rating of 87.  Its low and it scares me.    However, that should tell you how good I think there food is - I gladly continue to frequent this establishment despite this stomach quivering low  sanitation rating."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered take out from here regularly and loved them. However, one time I noticed they had double-charged my credit card. I called them several times about it and was always told to call back another time when their manager was available. Eventually I told them no, that their manager should call me and left them my number. Never got that call, so now I have to find another Chinese take out place. Beware these crooks!"}
{"text":"Fortune Cookie is definitely my spot that I call when I want chinese delivered. So much so that I got a group together for lunch at work and their delivery service was par excellent again!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here a few days ago. Was extremely nauseous after eating the shrimp and chicken with broccoli with no sauce on it. About two hours passed, leaving work, did not make it home before I became violently ill. I was offered a store credit and was told they do not do refunds. I will NOT be eating from here again."}
{"text":"Really really enjoyed the food here. Is it top notch? No. Is it cheap, large proportions and comforting expectedly Chinese food? Yes! You walk in and order at the counter and sit down. Food is served to you and on paper plates. I really enjoyed the general tso chicken. It was not spicy at all but very good. Also enjoyed the egg drop soup and the sesame chicken. Parking is easy and location is easy to get to."}
{"text":"Ordered the general Tsos combo dinner. Little over 8 bucks which isn't a terrible price and it was ready quick. The food was so bland I couldn't finish it. The chicken hard barely any hint of General Tsos sauce on it and was pretty much dry. The \"fried rice\" was so plain I could hardly manage a forkful. Friend rice is supposed to have onions and possibly some other veggies and egg mixed in and this was just white rice that looked like it had been coated in oil while cooking. Portion size was smaller than other places I have had as well. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly satisfying Chinese comfort food.   I was at a business meeting at the Sheraton and needed a Chinese food fix.  The Fortune Cookie was in walking distance so off I went.  The menu has a wide variety of combinations.  I went with the Sweet and Sour Chicken and paid a modest upcharge for pork fried rice as the accompaniment.  The rice was awesome with the roast pork bordered with the red glaze so common in the Northeast but increasingly rare elsewhere.  There was a nice smokey flavor as well.  The Chicken which I ate without the sauce was crisp on the outside and tender inside.  Nice!  I walked back to Uptown on the wonderful nearby hike and bike path to offset my satiated stomach."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Chinese food I have ever had. Just terrible. Tasted old and was barely edible. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Been patronizing this business for close to 6 years. Made an order yesterday and it was perfect. Ordered today from the same address and was given a jacked up delivery fee. Asked to speak to a manager and surprise! There was none available. Terrible treatment of their loyal customer."}
{"text":"Food is cheap.  Service is good. Lots of coupons that make the cheap food cheaper."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT a sexy establishment but if what you want is good hot Chinese food you got it!  There are tables and booths - the place kind of looks like a Burger King knock-off.  The have a TV too to watch while you are waiting for your order.  Located right by the Double Door Uptown - this location is super convenient for those of us living or working Uptown.    I got the Mongolian Beef which was the proper amount of spice.  Tender meat and lots of mushrooms and onions.  (You can request white rice also!)  Not too saucy and everything was great the next day.  It was so much food I couldnt finish it!!  The boyfriend got the Sesame Chicken and I tried a bite or two of his.  I don't like breaded stuff but it was very tasty.  Both orders together were around $15 bucks and came up super quick!    They deliver too!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I get take out from here often. We have always enjoyed it, I get the Sa-Cha Chicken and its pretty epic. Mildly spicy brown sauce, tons of veggies and chicken. Everything tastes/looks fresh.   Word of warning though, I once went on lunch break and ordered when I arrived. I sat there for 30 minutes, so CALL AHEAD if you are doing lunch. It was a disaster, they had two people running the front and back. I felt like transforming into Gordon Ramsay ugh."}
{"text":"The steamed chicken and mixed veggies that I got was actually very well prepared and tasty. They served it with a bowl of warm soy sauce. It looked like soy sauce soup!   The serving portion was huge and clearly enough for two meals.    So, here's the deal:  I guess I prefer restaurants with regular plates and glasses versus styrofoam.  I guess I prefer having a server take my order, versus going to a little counter to order.  My friend, Kathleen, pointed out that the styrofoam keeps the food costs low. I pointed out that i would have gladly paid the difference PLUS my way would be better for the environment.  She pointed out that the diverse crowd in the restaurant probably wouldn't be able to afford eating here if there were plates and glasses.  Maybe she's right on that one, but I still like real dishes.   Back to my original point: the food that I had was good. It would have been even better, I bet, on a real plate with a real fork.  Go ahead, call me an old prude. It's okay; I have been called worse things. I should have paid more attention to my fortune cookie fortune, but instead I was too concerned with where to pitch the styrofoam."}
{"text":"Late night crew deliveried TERRIBLE takeout meal.  The food smelled so bad that we gagged upon smelling it.  We had to throw out entire meal.   I have never had a worse take out experience in my life.  The food honestly smelled so bad, it will be awhile before I can consider ordering any type of Asian take out again.  It was really a terrible experience...  A manager/owner should review this situation, and general quality at off hour times."}
{"text":"The food was okay! It's great for what they were charging. I wish they weren't located in such an awkward place though. Due to a road being shut down for construction in Charlotte it was kind of hard to get to it.  The rice they gave us with the chicken/cashew and the beef/broccoli combinations weren't good at all, though. The chicken fried rice we ordered on the side was absolutely amazing. It saved the day!   Overall, it was an A-OK place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Chinese food is sorta like Mexican food for me.  Kind of hard to screw it up.  That being said I really like Fortune Cookie.  The decor is nothing to write home about and I think they probably do 90% sales from takeout and delivery if I were to guess.    You walk in through the door and the host is there at the register with a headset chatting away with people calling in and placing orders.  This is kind of a hindrance because it's hard to tell if they are talking to you or the person on the phone.  I was there for takeout and our food was ready within 10-15 minutes which is pretty good but I overheard the people calling in and being told it was going to be at least 45 minutes....ouch!    If I had one suggestion for the owners it would be to monitor their teenage kid as to make sure when he belches that it can't be heard in the dining room.  Not even kidding when I say it was the loudest burp I've heard in quite some time and the staff didn't even bat an eye.  I guess that's a compliment? Ha...I didn't care...I just giggled and smiled.  I call that character!"}
{"text":"I love this Chinese Food! I have never had anything on the menu that I didn't like. I used to go to there other location in Steele Creek, but when I googled Chinese by my job uptown I was so thrilled to know they had a closer location. I occasionally will order to go, or sit down either way food is always fresh, hot and tasty! General Tso's chicken is phenomenal with vegetable fried rice. Or even the shrimp and broccoli! Prices are reasonable and worth it! Oh and there sweet tea is heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"The Good: Great food! I got the combo Sesame Chicken which was amazing, my date got the General Tso tofu extra spicy and it was the best General tofu we've had in Charlotte!  The Bad: I ordered delivery on a Tuesday night and it took 50 minutes to deliver less than a mile (a little slow in my opinion). They forgot my spring rolls (2) and refused to deliver them or make it right! No brown rice is offered, just white or fried.  I'll try this place again for delivery, just because the food was really that good but will ALWAYS check my bag before they leave!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food (you'll read why) but the process of ordering online is horrible.  We placed an order online, knowing there could be up to 60min delivery time, and once I called 90 minutes later they said they didn't receive the order.  I got the confirmation email clearly stating our order, time it was placed, house address, etc.  The lady on the phone at first was very helpful and say we wouldn't need to pay.  I reread the order to her and after reciting the order she asked, \"How would you like to pay for this?\" and followed up with \"Why wouldn't you pay for this?\"  Nice knowin' ya \"Fortune Cookie Chinese Restaurant\"......see ya never."}
{"text":"The Chicken & Broccoli is good. This is one of the better Chinese takeout joints in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nothing special but OHHH SOOO CHEAPP!!! Also, a tad better than a hole in the wall Chinese places. The food? Pretty good, not stellar but for the price you can't beat it! I always get lo-mein, singapore noodle, or beef chow fun.  If you are uptown and want cheap Chinese food that doesn't taste cheap, this is your go to place. However, if you want quality Chinese food, I'd suggest another restaurant on the same block that is much bigger and a better dining experience, Cuisine Malaya. Also, I am not sure why this place is rated 2 dollar signs, I'd say it is more like 1. Also one last tip, I learned that you can request lunch portion on pretty much ANYTHING on their menu, even the chef's special, so make sure you ask for it if you don't want as big of a portion, it'll save you a good $2 or so on each item. Lastly, try their beef chow fun, OMGGG, awesome. Not the best I've ever had but out of all the entrees I tried from this restaurant, they nailed the beef chow fun. Tender beef, well separated noodle, paired with snow peas, a bit of sprouts, carrots and diced mushroom. The veggies are all cooked crunchy. Nicely flavored not too salty, NO sour taste like some take out Chinese places. Worth my $8.95."}
{"text":"I had the wing special with shrimp fried rice shrimp sauce and a sweet tea  ....food was cooked how I like it fresh.... Fast service!!!!  Will be back"}
{"text":"Had Chicken Kon Bu for lunch at their new location on Kings.   The chicken in the dish was inedible.  It had been prepared improperly by whomever cut it up.  Instead of individual bite size pieces, several such pieces were strung together by veins or gristle in my prepared food.  I would attempt to pick up a single bite of chicken and a whole string of chicken pieces connected by this gristle would come up with the bite I intended.  Like 2 or 3 inches worth.  It was disgusting and inedible.  If I were cooking at home, I would never serve this to my family.    You can't chew and swallow that crap.  It will gag you.  I ate the veggies and threw the rest in the trash.  About 95% of my chicken was inedible.    The rest of the dish tasted good and was fresh, but it was swimming in a puddle of reddish grease.  An absolute puddle.   It is not that hard to serve stir fry without putting all that grease on the plate.  But you have to care.  That is what seems to be missing at this place.  They apparently do not care about your dining experience.  They got your money up front.    If you walk in here expecting the Wok Express, you will greatly disappointed.     All in all, there are plenty of other places in the area to eat lunch.  For Chinese, Bistro 88 is excellent.  If these folks want to stay in business, they better get their act together, and soon."}
{"text":"please do not eat here. 2 of my co-workers got violently ill after having lunch there. this was the week of april 13, 2015. the sickness was unbearable. this place is horrible!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! Fast delivery (took way less than 45-50 min) although I will say ordering was a bit of a process due to some language barriers (on both ends). The Sesame chicken was fairly crispy as requested and the sauce was not sickeningly sweet thankfully and had a nice flavor! For $8 combo with rice and choice of spring roll or egg roll it was a pretty cheap dinner. The crab rangoon were delicious and perhaps my favorite part of the meal. Not sure what was up with the fried rice without egg or veggies or anything ...I'm not sure if it is a Charlotte thing but the last two places I've gone have been like this. I also wasn't a huge fan of their egg-rolls - since I prefer mine with a little more flavor.   I will give it another shot because I thought the chicken sauce was one of the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was the same. Nice spot if you are downtown looking for awesome fried rice. I will be back there again real soon."}
{"text":"Poor quality food and when you call to complain about something they could care less."}
{"text":"Great food. Not too pricey and they're always very quick preparing the order. I've never had them deliver, always carried out."}
{"text":"I just got a quick carry out for lunch here at their newest location.  The lunch lo mein is a good size for the price, I was pleased with it.  The taste was delicious and it wasn't dry, it came with plenty of sauce-much to my delight.   The new location is nice inside.  It is spacious and comfortable.  The girl who checked me out was talkative and friendly.  When I placed the order on the phone, she was helpful with questions I asked.  Parking is easy, it's in a strip mall.  This was a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy or overrun with traffic.  It was an easy in, and an easy out!"}
{"text":"It was not greasy like normal Chinese food. Enough to eat and save for later. Not much leftovers, but a taste for the next day lol. Customer service was good. Parking was limited . Overall I've had better Chinese food but it was a quick bite to eat that was satisfying after a run at freedom park."}
{"text":"I like Fortune Cookie for lunch!  Their restaurant may be tiny, but their staff is friendly and the service quick.  My favorite entree is the broccoli with garlic sauce.  The sauce has spicy flavor, and the broccoli is firm and fresh.  Their fried rice is decent, and you can have a choice between their egg roll, which features pork, and their vegetarian spring roll.  A bit disappointing is their sesame tofu, due to the sauce being a bit thin and without the almost candied flavor of other sesame sauces that I have enjoyed.  Still, Fortune Cookie is still a good bet for your money.  I will continue to order my beloved broccoli with garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Alot of food, resonably priced great service.  Parking can be a challenge at times."}
{"text":"Stop in here for the first time since they had moved over by the double door 2 years ago. It was fairly nice inside and the food came out fairly quickly but, I found the quality of the food to be quite a few steps less than from the original office. The fried rice was really nothing more than white rice that was browned in the pan and the Egg Roll in my beef and broccoli was extremely mushy. Sad quality has fallen so far downhill in the past 2 years I really hope they can do something to change it around to the way it used to be.."}
{"text":"Hot, fast and very tasty American-style Chinese food.  Big portions and low prices.  I was staying at the Wingate Hotel nearby on a layover and these guys really made my night by delivering a tasty dinner with a smile.  Definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I think I've ever had. We used to love this place when it was Wok Express. The crispy scallion chicken was inedible. It tasted like it had been frozen for a long while. I didn't even bother to tell the employees that my meal was bad, I just will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I was really sick, home bound and helpless for a few days. I ordered 5 chick soups with rice and chow mein with NO OIL. They were truly plain enough to help me survived my ordeal and saved my life!   I will begin ordering NO OIL from now on!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some good Chinese food for dinner.  We were hoping to find something in between PF Changs and your neighborhood take-out.  Fortune Cookie was much closer to the latter.  We arrived late on a week night there was only one other table finishing up.  Staff was attentive, food was decent.  DW really liked her garlic chicken, the General Tso's that I ordered was almost too spicy to enjoy.  The restaurant itself is not the nicest, but I'm guessing most of the business this place does is take out.  I sort of wished we would have tried somewhere else.   Live and learn..."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I LOVE Chinese food and have had a hard time finding a place I like here.  We were there kind of late on a Friday night and it was pretty dead inside but tons of people coming in to get carry-out orders.  We ordered and the food was there in less then ten minutes.   I was really impressed with the amount of food you received and everything seemed very fresh.  I had plenty for left overs and was impressed with the price and overall service."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here almost weekly. Very tasty and satisfying portions for a great price."}
