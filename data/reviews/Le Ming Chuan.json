{"text":"First of all, I'll start by saying that the resto was very friendly. It is small and family owned so the staff makes good efforts to please. 

Although the food was not the best Chinese food I've ever had in my life. I certainly wouldn't mind going back anytime. 

I found the dishes we ordered to be mostly tasty but too saucy at times. There was no rice included in the \"combo menu for 2\" to sop up all that sauce! 

The egg rolls , although they were delicious, were embarrassingly small in size relative to the norm (and relative to their price!)

The hot and sour soup honestly didn't have any kick to it and was devoid of any protein ( no tofu, pork, shrimp etc) and the wontons literally were devoid of stuffing too (like empty thick ghosts). 

We were very happy with the green tea ice cream for dessert (a nice touch)."}
{"text":"Ugh...I was so hopeful when I read the reviews on Just-Eat and I was looking forward to having me some Chinese food. Unfortunately, I regret my experience *Tear rolls down cheek*.

My buddy and I were having some refreshing adult beverages and we started to have a hankering for some grub. We decided to order some Chinese...I live a 1 minute walk away from Golden Bowl which is always gonna be good food but decided to step out of our bubble and try somewhere new. Ah...Le Ming Chuan...it's close and had good reviews.

I ordered Vegetable Szechuan Noodles and my buddy ordered the Crispy Sesame Beef...and of course a spring roll each (Delivery)

The restaurant is pretty much right down the street from me...Maybe a 5 minute drive at most. It still took an hour. When it arrived the delivery bag was collecting sauce and food at the bottom ( I'd say 15-20% of the whole meal). 

Hungry at this point, I open up my delicious Szechuan Noodles and it's not Szechuan Noodles it's Cantonese noodles. My buddy opens his Crispy Sesame Beef and it looks good!!!...It wasn't! I've had yogurt crispier than his Crispy Sesame Beef. It was soggy and cold and chewy. So thinkin me may salvage a bit of the meal we go for the Spring Rolls. They were tiny, soggy and tasteless....So sad

Very disapointing...Won't be ordering again :(."}
{"text":"Authentic sichuan food, all the spicy dishes are good if you can withstand the heat. This is probably one of the best in Brossard (please note that if you go to Toronto you will get much better Sichuan food, but in Brossard, this is the best)

For the main dish, I would recommend the spicy boiling fish, very tasty fish fillet with bean sprout. The appetizers are all good as well. Just beware that the dishes are a bit oily."}
{"text":"Super simple place and that's not negative at all. Great service, smiles all around, great prices for the quality and the quantity. Highly recommended for a quick lunch or dinner with a group of friends or children."}
{"text":"The food here was either too spicy or too salty.  There was nothing in between.  The salt and pepper shrimp was however the only dish that was good.  It was nice and crispy.

My group did order an extra dish afterwards, however, the beef dish took forever to come.  We had to follow up twice and the restaurant wasn't even busy at the time we went (9-9:30pm).  I'd expected more attentive service.  

I would have to say if I were in the area, I would not be returning to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Après recommandation de mes beaux parents nous sommes allés dîner un midi où nous faisions des commissions sur la Rive-Sud. Selon nous, la bouffe est ok, l'endroit est un peu mieux décoré que la moyenne des restos chinois et le service est bien. Rien à s'arracher les cheveux de sur la tête!

Je ne recommande définitivement pas le Pad Thaï ni la soupe Wonton, mais le buf a l'échalote, le Général Tao et le Chow Mein Cantonais sont très bons.

Foodies avertis: demandez le menu des Chinois, le choix est clairement plus élaboré si vous voulez sortir des plats traditionnellement Nord-Americains!"}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan food. Everything we ordered was delicious. Busy place, but very friendly. I have been coming back many times."}
{"text":"I went there with a reservation and thank god we made one! It's quite popular on weekends and it was very noisy. The food wasn't that good even though it's spicy enough, I had to drink water nonstop because it was so salty. To avoid if you don't eat spicy food"}
{"text":"We decided to try this \"close to home\" byob and are we ever glad we did! First of all, we completely agree with the ghost vegetarian imperial rolls (all batter, zero filling), and the hunan dumplings were also borderline ghost-like but the delicious peanut butter sauce made up for it. The orange beef was ok. The Singapore noodles were also just ok. The spring rolls were very generous and fresh and we decided to order the pepper squid (note, NOT your traditional black pepper squid!) but OMG amazing!!!! We noticed a dish at another table that we wanted to order and the reply was \"oh that's on the Chinese menu\", so we got the Chinese menu and ordered the garlic broccoli which was good but the best dish of the night by far was the cabbage dish. We all thought it was absolutely amazing. The service was excellent, The atmosphere is nice, spacious and very clean. There is plenty of parking. Did I mention it's a BYOB?! Oh and the nice surprise was the leftovers were great! Can't wait to go back!"}
