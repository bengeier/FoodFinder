{"text":"Great first experience. Will update this review after more visits to see how the business consistently runs.

I had 3 tacos for the Monday special. Two were two different kinds of pork then I had a steak taco too. My friend had a shrimp burrito. She was very happy with it.

My one complaint is that all the toppings are behind the counter. I like stocking my tacos on my own. But it's a change I can get used to.

Updated 7/29/2017 -- came back in for a quick stop with my wife and kid. The kids meals are very affordable, and my wife loved her carne asada taco. You can definitely bring your family here."}

{"text":"Taco time really impressed me everything was so delicious and fresh and very affordable awesome place"}
{"text":"Quick and easy taco/burrito place. Pretty authentic, although I don't know how much you can trust a random white guy telling you that. Anyway, Friday special was 3 tacos and 2 sides for $6 plus tax. Definitely a great deal."}
{"text":"Really
Good food, good prices and great customer service! 
Can't go wrong here! The chorizo is to die for"}
{"text":"Taco time is good!!! I've had other tacos before even street tacos but this place is much better! 

You order what you like then they cook them for you! As with all taco places, one is not enough so you might as well try one of each! 

The lengua taco is good! I had to order another one because it's that good!
The fish taco is not the typical breaded one other taco places makes for you. The fish is fresh and serve as it is with some seasonings that brings out the fish. The Asada taco is on point too.

The people there are nice and the food is good!"}
{"text":"Taco time is my favorite taco joint in Concord! The food is fantastic. Seriously Great flavor. The Spicy Chicken in my fave. The employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Taco Time is a restaurant that reminds you why you want to support small businesses! 

I ordered the tacos and they were delicious. They were only $1.75 per taco and offered an assortment of toppings to eat. They also had Mexican colas, which are my weakness!

The service is probably the best part of the restaurant. The employees are super friendly and love conversation.

I want to become a regular at Taco Time. The tasty food and great service make this place a staple!"}
{"text":"Taco Time?  Not for me!  I'm just not seeing this 5 star rating, even though with only 10 reviews it's still in the kindergarten stages of reviews!

I was extremely eager to try this taco joint on my way out of the Charlotte area.  Located in a strip building on a busy street in the Concord area, you can't miss the flaming red/yellow Taco Time lettering!

It's kinda set up like a Chipotle in that there's a bar in front of you for additional toppings for the tacos or burritos of your choice.  The burritos are large, stuffed full of good tasting toppings, but unless you get the carnitas as your meat you'll be disappointed!  The carnitas are really tasty, but one clarification, it's stewed pork, not deep fried pork!
The tacos are decent in size, large if you really lay the toppings on, but the steak and pork are so bland that you'll wonder what did I just eat?  The corn tortillas are fabulous, quite possibly homemade, and the steak pieces are raw and thrown on the grill upon ordering!  Problem is, they must add no seasoning once it's on the grill or marinate the meat beforehand?

Lots of potential at Taco Time, but at this point in time, they're just missing the mark!"}
{"text":"Yum. I had a Carne asada taco, a beef taco & a spicy chicken taco. All three were very tasty and the price was great. I'll definitely be back.
The man behind the counter was very friendly, he explained all the options and made me feel very welcomed and appreciated. It's a small place with limited seating. It's clean and smells like tacos."}
{"text":"Very good tacos. Highly recommended. The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's very authentic"}
{"text":"Great new little spot to get your fix on for some Mexico and SoCal street classics. 

Their Chorizo sausage is the real deal. I highly recommend this one. 

The crew is super accommodating to tastes and experience. 

They are still new and figuring things out so keep coming back to see what's up."}
{"text":"Awesome specials, and the staff are so nice!! Great food, definitely my new taco place."}
