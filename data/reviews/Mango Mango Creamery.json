{"text":"I ordered a chocolate strawberry crepe. Service was slow. They poured the batter on the pan and went into the back room for a good 5min, came back out, flip it then left again.  The strawberries tasted like they've been sitting there for a while. The chocolate ice cream had freezer burns and smelled like they left it in the freezer uncovered. The crepe came out chewy and tough. I did like that they put it in a waffle cone and it looked photogenic enough, but I wouldn't pay $6.32 for that again."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the Oreo Reese's Peanut Butter Blast Ice Cream and I ordered the Chocolate S'mores Crepe. It was slower to get our food but it was well worth it. The ice cream was flavored and made fresh to order. The crepe was enormous and delicious. We will return next time we're at the mall looking for a treat."}
{"text":"Yumm! Got a mango bubble tea tasted awesome, they aren't smoothies so don't expect it to be thick like one! The mango banan crepe is great as well. They also have sushi too! 
Ice cream rolls are $4.95
Bubble tea $4.85 small and $5.25 large
Crepes prices aren't show on menu. I think mine was like $5-$6 maybe
Sushi-maki roll $3.50, special $$5.95, and nigiri $2.50
Great little place at the food court by the Cajun place"}
{"text":"couldn't be better! Amazing smoothie and awesome people. Nice place to drink, eat n relax! Btw if you like rolling ice cream, don't miss out their technic, they are PRO!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoothies. I came back two days in a row.  I plan to come back to try their sushi.   i ordered a pineapple,  coconut and strawberry smoothie with tapioca.   great!!!"}
{"text":"Really interesting place for a mall food court option. Very reasonably priced as well. My wife got one sushi roll and it ended up making 6 servings. It was $2.50 or something like that. Really good price and she said it was a good roll. I'm not a sushi person, so I'll take her word for it. 
I got a s'mores Japanese crepe. It was a handmade crepe with Nutella, marshmallow, Graham crackers and I had him add banana. He also put vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and hot fudge. It was so good. He also explained what he was doing it as he was building it. Kind of a nice touch if you ask me!
We will definitely be back again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Had the rolled ice cream here, and I was impressed! Only $5 for a big cup of ice cream, the neat experience of seeing them make it to order for you, and a very pretty presentation. I had the \"mango mango\" ice cream, which was topped with small pieces of fresh mango; they also have a lot of other flavors, bubble tea, smoothies, sweet crepes, and sushi. Neat place to have in the mall food court!"}
