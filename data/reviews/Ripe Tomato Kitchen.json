{"text":"Pretty good, though it depends on the day. Service is fast, employees are friendly, customer service is fantastic and the pizza is pretty good. Occasionally it comes a little bit soggy but for the most part, its great pizza that keeps us coming back at least twice a month."}
{"text":"I've had the Sicilian and its hands down 10 times better than Famoso.  I paid 12 bucks asked them to cook it well done (not burnt or black) it was magnifico! I paid 18 bucks at Famoso and felt totally ripped off.  I think it depends on what kind of pizza you enjoy but I've had the Sicilian & Pesto Chicken loved both equally.  My customizations of the pizza I've also enjoyed just ask them to keep it in the oven longer. I'm sure the staff are trained to only have it in the oven for x amount of time."}
{"text":"Minimal toppings, soggy thin crust. We just ordered take-out from Ripe Tomato in West Springs. Sad to say but I have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store. There were dabs of tomato sauce with a sprinkling of cheese. If they firmed up the crust and added way more toppings, this pizza would at least be passable. Needless to say, we do not recommend this place and will not return."}
{"text":"Soggy and gross sauce on the pizza. My 4 year old could make a better pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"It's a new place, so this review might be unnecessarily harsh while Ripe Tomato works out the kinks. But I found it to be quite lacking. The workflow was extremely disorganized resulting in long order times that could easily be shortened with training and organization. The pizza is not cooked long enough or hot enough, so it comes out very soggy.Something is wrong with the dough recipe; I believe they are trying to use a typical dense pizza dough recipe rather than sourcing true 00 flour and designing a Napolean style crust that is fit for that type of application. What you get is a thin, dense, soggy crust.  Toppings are minimal with very unusual (not particularly good) preset combinations. They don't even have real proscuitto. The sauce lacks flavour.   If you're after takeaway, you're better off with Famoso in Westhills."}
{"text":"New pizza place in Aspen Woods near the No Frills.   We went on a Friday and it was somewhat busy.  The staff seemed to be calm, but the service was very slow - perhaps just ironing out the new business wrinkles.   The pizza is forno style and the inside has a few tables to sit in and eat.  Most people were doing take-out.     The pizza itself was tasty. The toppings were a bit stingy but the dough was really good and the sauce was tasty.   Overall I enjoyed the taste but the flavour wasn't anything memorable."}
