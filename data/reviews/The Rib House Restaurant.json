{"text":"Open late, dirt-cheap and a very friendly owner.  It's literally a hole in the wall and a hang-out for locals but if you're willing to look past that, you'd have a great little spot for a late-night snack."}
{"text":"While The Rib House is nothing to get excited about in terms of its physical appearance, you should be getting excited about the culinary perfection that is about to be your dinner! The Rib House makes the most delicious, perfectly cooked, fall off the bone, sweet, sticky, perfectly seasoned and coated rack of ribs I have ever eaten. Seriously, I have never found ribs in any other restaurant that are this good!   Definitely order take-out though, as it is a dive inside. It comes with a side of potatoes of some sort, and coleslaw. We always get mashed potatoes. The cook boils the potatoes right in front of you, and strains them and mashes the potatoes with milk, butter, salt & pepper, just like your Mom would do! He is a nice guy and takes pride in his work and you can tell he enjoys what he does. He infuses happy vibes into his food and charges a fair price for a pretty pricey item!  Sticky, gooey, sweet delicious ribs! So worth waiting for and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday maybe for the last 11 years, i see the sign but never venture in.  It always looks closed.  The hours posted are actually 11am-11pm not sure if that's accurate but i ordered via phone last night around 6pm for pick up.  We got the full rack of ribs with fries and coleslaw $22.95.  The ribs are pretty good, i think they may be pre-boiled then grilled on the stove top grate.  The fries are frozen and although i asked if the coleslaw was homemade and got a \"yes\"  it's not.  Take a pass on the frozen fries in dirty oil and the Ziggys type coleslaw.  The ribs however are good, i wouldn't drive miles for them but if you live in the neighbourhood or in the area a half  or full rack won't dissapoint."}
{"text":"Loved them years ago and raved about them to my husband when we moved back to the neighborhood.  What a disappointment.  While the portion size was excellent, they were burned black and dry. French fries overcooked. Worst meal ever,what we ate of it."}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighbourhood and how is this place not huge? I have gone to ribfests and it not prize winning, but it can go toe to toe with any winning rib i have had. Tender, a perfect and clearly mastered marinade and prep, appetizing look, fall off the bone...in a word sensational. To add to that their price is ridiculously affordable. 2 stuffed adult humans on a 3/4 rack, with fries and gravy = $20.  I have always been skeptical of run down locations and potential sketchy patrons, but this place is the urban legend you hear about. (Kiss fingertips and toss away) Benissimo! Go here if u like ribs and saving money.... Right now!!"}
{"text":"Solid food at a great price. So far I've tried the burgers and the ribs. Both offer great bang for the buck. It's super cheap too! A banquet burger and beer with tip is literally 10$ all in.  Decor is not bringing anyone back but the food and the price point is !"}
{"text":"I'm going to back the other reviewers and say that take-out is your best bet, unless you like extremely dive-y bars. I would not even really classify this as a restaurant based on the interior - it's more like a bar that happens to specialize in making ribs. It's a totally sketchy place with a bunch of interesting-looking people coming in and out of there all the time. That being said, the ribs were pretty good - definitely fall-off-the-bone with a nice crust. Maybe too-fall-off-the-bone as two out of the three racks we got were on the dry side for me (caveat: I like my ribs with a bit of chew). The sauce was tasty - slightly sweet, not smoky, and with an interesting spice in it - maybe curry powder or cumin? The sauce is especially good where it had dripped onto the fries, which are super deep fried but soft on the inside. The garlic bread was forgettable. I would skip the coleslaw - it's vinegar-based and way too pungent. I can't recall if they take credit cards but I just assumed they didn't so I paid in cash. Overall, I'd get take-out from here again, but just the ribs and not the whole platter. I'd also consider trying other meat items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best ribs and fries I've had in the city! Don't judge a book by its cover -- this is a hidden gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"Another great meal from the Rib House.  We've been getting takeout there pretty regularly  for the past 3 or 4 years.  John makes consistently good food.  My partner wanted takeout from the Rib House for his birthday meal.   That's a pretty solid two thumbs up.   Still not the finest eat-in eating establishment but the food is so good!  I decided to step out of my ribs/burger/ribs/ribs/burger rut and ordered the liver and onions - they came with very good mashed potatoes  (and gravy) that John made up while we waited and probably the best steamed broccoli ever - I swear he gave me a quarter head - brilliantly green and delish. I could cut the liver with my fork - perfectly prepared.   My partner had a hamburger combo + a burger.  Both prepared to his liking.  Freshly prepared supercrispy fries.    My dinner + burger + burger combo (includes drink) was under $20 including taxes."}
{"text":"Ordered #65. Full Rib Platter. The platter come with a generous portion of ribs along with fries, coleslaw and garlic bread.  Ribs were fall of the bone good, BBQ sauce not bold rough for my tastes, but still tasty. The owner/manager John Chow hits the rib with honey to finish them.  The fries are the good frozen kind, crispy on the outside, soft & potatoee on the inside. I added gravy to my order but fries could hold it's own. The gravy is probably from a can, but it was dark, salty and delicious.  The garlic bread was also surprisingly good. It was nicely grilled toasted and garlicky.  The weakest part of the platter was the oily coleslaw. Not much to say about it, I didn't like it.  The place is a dive, almost scary! If it wasn't for the previous reviewers I would nevern have stepped into a place like this.... And I love dives! This is a \"take out\" place for sure.    Would I go back? Yes! Would I recommend others to try? YES!  But you can't be the faint of heart. The Rib House badly needs a restaurant make over but IMO worth a try if you're in the area!"}
