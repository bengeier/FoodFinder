{"text":"Surprisingly good. Definitely better then the pho that was served by the previous owner. I ordered the assorted meats pho. The broth was very flavorful. The meatballs were cut in slices, which made eating it more convenient. I loved that they already had small dishes at the table to use to separate the hoisin sauce and Sirachi sauce for dipping my noodles :). I did not like that there was no option for a small pho vs large pho. One size fits all?  The special drink of the day was the tri color jelly. Too much ice for my liking. Maybe I was also too full to enjoy it.   I would definitely come back for another bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was roomy and clean. The service was fast and friendly. The pho, sandwich and summer rolls were great."}
{"text":"5 stars for price, service, and quality of food. Pho was delicious. Broth great. Meat plentiful. Bonus for boba tea."}
{"text":"Great tasting pho for a great price, can't beat it! I brought my family here and we all have high expectations for pho. We've gone to many places around cleveland and other cities and I must say this place is impressive! Will definitely fulfill a pho craving. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Okay pho restaurant but the best in cleveland ohio   I hate to go duoerior pho because of thier service and so so pho they are super overatted   I would rather come here to enjoy pho it is just okay restaurant"}
{"text":"Vietnamese food is a taste that I enjoy. Definitely worth the money, and the meal was really enjoyable. I recommend checking the place out because I only recently found out about it. One of my co-workers advised me to eat here and I am happy she did."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.  Have never been here before and decided to give it a try instead of our usual #1 Pho.  This place was excellent and we will be back.  My husband ordered shrimp fried rice.  The plate was heaping and enough for two of us.  He loved it. I ordered the beef vermicelli w/ vegetables.  Oh my goodness it was delicious and again the bowl was heaping and enough to share.  It was very delicious with fresh ingredients.  Delicious tea and was no charge.  Overall we loved this place.   For less than $20.00 for two of us, it was outstanding.    The menu was easy to read and understand with specifics of what each dish contained.  This was especially helpful since we don't know the language LOL. Our waiter was attentive and efficient.    I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Recent ownership change this past year. Definitely one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland now. Their pho is on par with Superior Pho with bigger portions of noodle and meat. $1 more gets you an XL. They also have very good 'bun' which is the noodle salad and the meat selections are tasty."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite resturant in Cleveland. Their banh mi with a fried egg is my favorite.! Very generous amount of meat. Their pho is the best around here also. Best authentic Vietnamese food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What a great place to get a hot bowl of Pho!  Just a tip. I drove around for a few minutes before I found the place. The address states that it's on Superior but it's in the Asian Town Center so google maps will not get you to the location correctly. With that being said the whole rest of the experience was positive.   The resturant is very clean and our waiter was friendly. I know other yelpers tend to have their favorite places for Pho but me, I am working my way around town to try them all. I have found a few favorites along the way and this place is great! The flavor is good and the sriracha and hoisin sauce are right there on the table ready to be used if you want them.   For all the Pho lovers out there make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent, interior is trendy and fun, I'll give it that, but my issues with this restaurant mainly revolve around its service. I'm under the impression that it's relatively new so I'll cut it a bit of slack (otherwise I might give 2 stars), but still need to review some of the shenanigans that happened:   - Two of my friends got both their appetizers and main course (pho) before anybody else got any food. Then three of us got our food 10 minutes later. Then finally our last friend got his food probably 10-15 minutes after that. Nobody should have to watch their friends eat for nearly 30 minutes, and nobody should have to wait for their food to get cold either!  - They didn't bring out the typical plate of limes, veggies, jalepenos or whatever until 10 minutes after the first people got their pho. They had run out of bean sprouts, and for some reason, the \"jalepenos\" had no spice and tasted exactly like green peppers!  - I ordered \"Combo #1\" which comes with a bowl of pho and some sort of roll. I ordered the \"Bi Cuon\" roll, something I haven't had before, but they kept bringing out the wrong rolls for us and getting the orders mixed up. I explained to them at least 3 times that I ordered the Bi Cuon, but I eventually was stuck with a summer roll. I'm not exactly sure if they realize what's on their menu!   - To top it all off, they got mixed up and charged a friend's order to my card, so we had to deal with paying each other back  We came to this restaurant because we forgot Superior Pho is closed on Mondays, and apparently Saigon Grille looks like it went under? I expect that this may be the only reason I end up coming back here. Or maybe I'll give it one more shot though, who knows."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Bun Bo Hue that I ordered. The broth was on point and they gave a big portion. Located inside an Asian shopping center, the restaurant is located to the corner of the center. The Asian center looked pretty empty but the restaurant is a definitely must try if you're wanting to enjoy a home cooked meal. Along with my bun bo hue, I ordered a honeydew boba. Ordered a slush but came out a tea. Perhaps a miscommunication there but the boba tea wasn't so bad. Highly recommend the restaurant if you're craving home cooked Vietnamese meal in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Visited this new Pho place the other night when we found out that Superior Pho was closed on Mondays.  The place was nicely decorated and comfortable, in the new Asia Town Center.  We got bowels of pho and were pleasantly surprised- they were large and had wonderful broth.  Would have loved a little more meat in my bowl, but it wasn't bad.  I think that this would be comparable for Superior Pho for the best pho in Cleveland, but I think I might like it more because it is close to an Asian grocery.  Service was polite and helpful.  Will be back.  This place deserves your business!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pho shop. We tried the bun bo hue  and the bi cuon, and both were delicious. The service was also quick and helpful, which is always a plus. Nice hidden spot that's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Viet food in Cleveland. Authentic, clean, and not too salty. Pho w/ brisket is my go to comfort food. Definitely coming back and telling all my friends!"}
{"text":"I usually cook Ph at home so I know what constitutes a good bowl of Ph. So when I was in Cleveland for a training, I craved for Ph and decided to check this place out. It blew up my expectations. The broth is aromatic and just right. I highly recommend this place. Don't go to Ph Superior #1. I tried that place which was not good."}
{"text":"So basically my favorite Vietnamese dish is bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup). Unfortunately, Superior Pho's misses the mark by far and Saigon Grill is still closed. But I found out this place has it!   Me: I'd like the bun bo hue. Waiter: Do you want that spicy? Me: (Why is this even a question? Is the ocean blue? Is the good earth green?) Yes!!  And spicy it was. My mouth was burning, just the way I like it. You think Sriracha is hot? Good luck with this one.  My only criticisms were that there was too much pork (which I don't like) and not enough beef (which I do like). Typically this dish comes with a pork leg and some congealed pork blood cubes, which were not present here (I'm not complaining). I was also a little disappointed that they mixed the bean sprouts, banana blossom and cabbage together; it's the first place I've seen that does that. I hate bean sprouts, and I was not about to pick them out, so I didn't eat my veggies. My mother would be disappointed.  Impressed, I ordered a banh mi thit nuong to go. I ate it several hours later, so maybe I've missed the optimal flavor profile. There's a good bread:meat/veggie ratio. The meat is on the sweeter side, and the pickled daikon and carrots could be pickled a bit longer. I prefer Saigon Grill's, but they've been closed for months with no sign of returning...  Overall, would come here again."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland! Just moved from California, and I was so glad to find a place that was authentic and delicious!! Vietnamese coffee here is amazing too!"}
{"text":"A new Vietnamese restaurant! It's located in the Asia Town Center in the renovated warehouse.  We went to try this place out for their bun (rice noodles) and it was pretty good! The hubs is pretty particular about the meat in the bun, and he said they grilled it well and that it was very flavorful. There isn't much for vegetarians here...so I went ahead and ordered a meat bun and gave it to the hubs.   It was very quiet though - we were the only people there at 6pm on a weeknight..."}
{"text":"Food seems on point. I went here w/ a Vietnamese friend and she recommended everything we ate and she liked it (as did I, but I figure in this case her opinion matters more). Price was right and portion size was huge. I got the vermicelli (see pic) since I don't like typical pho (too watery to be a main meal for me) and she got pho (I forget which one). There's not much of an ambiance but who cares, I came to EAT!!   The place is in the Asian marketplace (a mini indoor mall of sorts which only has a few Asian restaurants and an Asian grocery store). The restaurant doesn't have its own restroom, you have to use the public restroom in the mall hallway, it is gross and with diluted soap as you would expect.   Can't wait to go back, just writing this review is making me salivate for it! Go here for your meal and then swing by Koko bakery (very close by) for dessert :)"}
{"text":"An amazing, family owned Vietnamese restaurant.  The staff is the friendliest and the food is excellent.  I am hooked on B2!"}
{"text":"Swing by the Asian Town Center (not directly off Superior) and you'll find some low cost food to fill your belly.  The portions are actually really good for the cost and the flavor is on point.  We had the \"PHO NINH KIEU DAC BIET\" Pho soup with all 5 cuts of beef for $9.50; \"BUN BO HUE\" A spicy noodle soup originating from Vietnam with herbs and beef shank for $9.50; and, \"MI DAT BIET\" an egg noodle soup with shrimp and BBQ pork with spinach and vegetables for $9.50. All three were great, but the spicy soup was my favorite, but I think I'll get it with the vermicelli noodles next time (They will gladly customize the orders). I also saw a few stir-fried dishes that look good and I'm going to try them in my next visit.  We also had some bubble tea, which was quite good.    The place was super clean and the waiter was really nice and patient with all our questions.  Overall, I left very happy and very full for less than $10 not counting the tip.  This is a good place to stop for Pho and Vietnamese food for sure. Just take note, even if it's listed as spicy, it won't have a good amount of heat.  It's what I like to call \"white people spicy.\"  Ask for it to be Vietnamese spicy if you want the proper heat.  There's a clear different."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho restaurant in Cleveland. What I like about their pho is the broth. It is so flavorful and fresh. They also have two kinds of rice noodles. One is the regular rice noodle you get at any other pho restaurants. The other one is the round rice noodle, which I prefer. The round rice noodle has a softer and smoother texture than the flat regular ones. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really good Pho. The broth is perfect. Noodles were also perfect I noticed Ninh Kieu is the only one of four Pho places in Cleveland that has the tiny sauce saucers stacked on the table, good sign of things to come. My wife ordered the Bun Bo Hue and noticed the bean sprouts also included banana blossoms, nice touch. The add on veggies for my Pho were all pretty fresh, and included the slender herbal spiky leaf, of which I don't know the name. It's rare even in California where there are tons of Pho joints. My only disappointment came when I discovered that my pho contained no tendon. A component that I was really looking forward to. The other day my wife had Pho at another place and was plagued by her \"msg\" headaches later that evening. No \"msg\" headache tonight! Another good point for Ninh Kieu. Cleveland's lucky to have a really good pho restaurant. The only thing C needs now is a good bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"My new favorite Vietnamese spot in Cleveland. Friendly waters, fast service, and the place is clean. It's a little more expensive than other pho places, but they are very generous with the meat and the broth is fantastic."}
{"text":"Ninh Kieu is a new Vietnamese restaurant that opened September 2013 inside Asian Town Center (E. 38th &  Superior Ave.).  Ninh Kieu and the new owners took over the location that use to be Pho 99 although much of the decor remains the same.  Since it just opened and it was Sunday afternoon, it was busy.  The servers were attentive and the lady in charge wanted to make sure we were happy.  We ordered the P1 - Rare Beef Pho noodle soup (this was mine), the N2 - Clear Noodle Soup with just Shrimp (it usually comes with shrimp and beef), C2 - Pork Chop and Rice, and C8 - Grilled Shrimp with Veggies and Rice.  See photos of our meal.  I got to sample everything and all the dishes were tasty.  But to me, Vietnamese restaurants make it or break it based on the Pho.  And Ninh Kieu's Pho was good.  Unlike some other places, the noodles soups only have one size.  The broth was savory and the noodles were plentiful.  The beef slices were on the smaller side, but the quantity was reasonable.  Overall, I'll go with 4 Stars as I definitely enjoyed the meal and highly recommend the restaurant especially for anyone that wants to grab a bite to eat, then shop at Asia Food Market.  Here is an excerpt that I post to my Pho reviews for people new to this standard Vietnamese dish:  It comes with your choice of meats along with rice noodles and some lighter herbs in a savory broth.  A plate of bean sprouts, Asian basil, mint, pepper and lime is brought out on a plate.  You can eat the noodle soup plain, and I recommend you do that for a bite or two to get an initial taste to enjoy the broth flavor.  Many people will put in healthy handfuls from the plate of veggies, twist the lime juice, throw in a sliced jalenpeno pepper, and then squeeze some hoisin sauce (thick black sweet/tangy flavoring), and red Sriracha chilli sauce (a little goes a long way as the Sriracha can overpower everything).  Mix it up and enjoy.  Many others prefer to put the sauces on a plate and dip the meat in it one bite at a time, in order to keep the broth and noodles as is.  Pho is a two handed affair with the soup spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other.  Lots of napkins are at the table to wipe your mouth AND your brow from eating all the hot noodles."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an Asian market off E. 38th.  My fiancée and I each had a craving for Pho and most places are closed on Sunday nights.  Ninh Kieu is open until 8:00pm. The  Banh mi was delicious, the bread was crunchy and soft.  The pho was very tasty as well.  The broth was not the best I've had but for an $8 dinner I was extremely satisfied.  The portions here tend to be a bit larger than other places."}
{"text":"Pho you by you. Pho sho. Pho me. I got the pho with brisket, eye of round rare, and some other meat. The broth had a nice depth of flavor. Served with typical basil, jalepenos, and bean sprouts. This was some superior pho.   Servlce was superior. I will be back"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new Vietnamese restaurant, and was pretty satisfied.  They offer a pretty standard menu for a Vietnamese restaurant, with your various soups, vermicelli bowls, broken rice dishes, banh mi, goi cuon, etc. I was able to try most of these thanks to my stupid large appetite, but I mostly came away impressed with their pho. Very flavorful broth, good portion of noodles and meat, and a very large portion overall. Usually I find myself smothering my bowl in hoisin sauce and sriracha (sorry not sorry pho purists), but the broth needed no help. My one small complaint would be that the meat had a little too much gristle for my liking.  I also ordered the banh mi, goi cuon, and got to try the bun thit nuong cha gio. They were okay... I probably wouldn't get any of them again here.  The service was very attentive and you won't have any language barrier problems. The place itself is very casual, not trying to be anything it isn't. They have a TV in the dining area as well.  Very good bowl of pho, and a worthy addition to Cleveland's stable of Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent pho. Very clean and friendly environment here. Good quick service and terrific tasting food. All of the pho stock is beef based so if you order chicken pho, it comes in beef stock, which to me was perfect because it was so flavorful. Loaded with rice noodles and chicken, and topped with the garnish of sprouts, basil jalapeños and lime...delish!!"}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi in Cleveland.  Had the spicy soup and it was heavenly.  Fantastic place in a great location.  Updated inside, so it looks very nice.  I consider this a must go place in Cleveland for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Good portions. Decent broth. Fair price."}
{"text":"Best pho you will eat in Cleveland!! We've eaten pho in all different places and cities and this is by far the best!! Service is excellent, friendly staff and extremely clean!!"}
{"text":"Ninh Kieu just replaced Superior Pho as my go-to place for pho in Cleveland. I've noticed some inconsistent quality issues at Superior Pho (last time I was there the bean sprouts were not fresh). So far great experiences at Ninh Kieu (except that I can never remember the name). Delicious pho - and they have the spicy pho which many other pho places in Cleveland doesn't have (it's not just pho + sriracha btw). And you can always get some grocery shopping done afterward at Asia Food Co."}
{"text":"Fast, and delicious. If you're on a lunch break and short on time, this is a great place to consider. I also ordered the Vietnamese coffee - i would have preferred it a little more sweet, but definitely a pick-me-up nonetheless."}
{"text":"The food and service were both outstanding. The food is also SO reasonably priced, with generous portions!  The Banh Mi is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, my friend and I got one to share and ended up ordering a second!  Tried the beef brisket pho- wonderful flavorful broth, a but oily but the meat was tended and noodles delicious!  I can't believe I'm replacing Superior Pho, but this place is certainly my new favorite!"}
{"text":"elusive banh mi cleveland is not hoi an continuation  Located in the \"other\" Asian Plaza on E39th/Superior, this is a solid little place. I've ordered carry-out online twice now. Both times I had a spicy noodle soup \"Bun Bo Hue\" and it was very good. Enough for 2 people.  I did add a bit of sriracha and some rice vinegar to jack it up a notch, but that's just my preference. You get a small wedge of lime with it, but I'd prefer a half of a lime myself. Having had it in Hue Vietnam, it is a very good version.  The Banh Mi is good as well. The bread is the light and crunchy style, so I think that it is in fact made with rice flour, however, it did not have the schmear of pate' that it should have.  But still, one of the better banh mi around.   I'll work through the menu piece by piece. The staff is very gracious. And a stop in the Asian Supermarket next door is a must!   Carry on."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant. Stopped by after Cleveland Flea. What a find. No Pictures because we ate everything. Will be back to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Asian town center is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. The service is great and everyone is friendly.  While I was there, even the chef came out to check on our food and make sure everything is going good.  There's an Asian grocery store in the shopping center so you walk off your food coma there.   Things to try:  1. Vietnamese bbq pork sandwich - a classic order and it is totally worth it as a individual meal or an appetizer. The French bread is soft, chewy and crispy. The bbq is flavored very well and the pickled veggies is just heavenly!   2. Bun Bo Hue - I got mine extra spicy because I love the heat. The broth is so flavorful. The veggie plate comes with a banana flower veggie that goes into the soup. When I saw that the veggie plate had the banana flower, I knew that this place is legit! Some Vietnamese supplements this with veggie with iceberg lettuce (boo!)   3. N3 - Hieu tieu Mi - this soup is so flavorful. It's a great dish for a cold winter day.   What a great find!"}
{"text":"New ownership as of this week -- now it's called Pho Ha Nam. Never went to Ninh Kieu so can't compare, but the waiter said the menu is mostly the same with a few changes.   Special four-meat pho ($9.50) was good: hot broth, generous serving of meat. I've been unhappy with the meat portions at Superior as of late, so this is good news. I only wish they offered tendon. Noodles were slightly softer than I'd prefer but no problem.   (Side note: does anyone know why pho is relatively pricey in Cleveland? In other cities, a special bowl will usually run between $5-$6.50, even at the most respected places in LA and Houston, where overhead is almost certainly higher. Guessing it's a volume thing, plus Superior being able to dictate market pricing as the most popular place in town.)  Lemongrass grilled pork banh mi ($5) was very good, with super fresh bread. Maybe the best I've had in Cleveland. Egg rolls were different but good -- curiously, they come with a sweet and sour sauce rather than the traditional fish sauce dip, which I prefer.   I'll definitely be back for the bigger portions and the banh mi!"}
{"text":"I like phò. The broth here is delicate but aromatic, the noodles have excellent texture, the meat is fresh and tender. The soup is served with plenty of onion and less cilantro than some.  Their banh mi (with regular or BBQ pork) is pretty spot on. The bread is perfect, and it is lightly fulfilled and neat to eat. If you wanted something gargantuan that falls apart with every bite go to on the rise.   Definitely worth the visit. The enthusiastic staff is happy to help you in anyway they can. A welcome addition to my rotation of Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Ninh Kieu is a nice place to grab a bowl of pho. The bowls are on the larger side of the size spectrum and have the price tag to match. The broth is pretty even keeled and not overly salted or spiced. The beef was of good quality and was not too fatty and unpleasant. I met a few people who claimed Pho 99 was the best in Cleveland and unfortunately, I never got to try it. I thought Ninh Kieu served up a fine bowl of soup and will be back at a later date to try some of the other menu options. The pictures they post on their Facebook site look wonderful.  https://www.facebook.com/ninhkieucleveland/timeline"}
{"text":"So I know what you're thinking if you're looking up this place... where in Cleveland is the best pho?  Well... people tend to often site Superior... and I agree they're pretty decent...good enough to satisfy that burning need for pho.  But I actually think this place is better.  Pho: The broth is more rich than at Superior.  Good blend of flavors, without skimping on the necessary components.  Good quantity of meat as well as lots of noodles.  Bahn Mi: This is my other big food component at any pho place.  Love the fact that they put a good amount of meat in it, but it's the wrong bun.  I like the crunch of the baguettes, and this was a soft bun.  Just not the same.  But also give a good amount of jalapeno with it, which is important.  Negative: crappy hours.  about half of the time I consider getting pho, they're already closed.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
