{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. I didn't try the lunch buffet upstairs but ordered a meal downstairs. Service great and very quick."}
{"text":"This review is about the 2nd floor buffet, not 1st floor menu.

Relative small buffet with the usual favorites. Soups: chicken wonton, veg hot & sour, egg drop. Lots of starch: white rice, plain fried rice, rice noodles, veggie noodles. Chicken included General Tso's (kind of gooey), kung pao chicken (greasy), chicken & broccoli, \"special chicken in spicy sauce\", sweet & sour chicken (i.e., breaded chicken fingers, sauce on the side). Also sweet & sour mushrooms (see chicken), Mongolian beef (or something close), veggie egg rolls, Szechuan pork, string beans, mixed vegetables, \"doughnuts,\" cut up melon, maybe one or two more items I forgot. Drinks included.

Food is good by cheap Chinese buffet standards. The sauces are a bit heavy (especially General Tso's), but have some flavor. Despite the labels, nothing is really spicy (including the hot sauce -- I've eaten here several times before, and they used to put out a very nice chili sauce. I don't know if the change is permanent or something happened today.). The fried stuff is not over greasy.

Everything well marked, quickly replenished (always crowded at lunch, which I guess is a good sign, with a steady stream of take-out as well) and so relatively fresh. You will probably have to wait a bit at lunch for a table. $7 plus tax."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I will never set foot in this place ever again. I had to throw away more than half the dish because it was inedible."}
{"text":"A well deserved one star.

I headed here with a few of my friends, and ate on the first floor because the buffet was closed. I ordered the curry squid rice, and our food arrived relatively quickly.

The squid rice was dull, kind of undercooked, and tasteless. The squid was definitely just chewy curled in sliced fish, and was identified as tilapia by my culinary major friend. The curry was in big yellow clumps tucked into the rice. 

My friends got chewy general tsos and teriyaki vegetable beef, where the sauce looked better than the actual food.

Our leftovers have sat in our fridge for three weeks and we feel bad for wasting, but it's almost inedible. Too expensive for something so lackluster."}
{"text":"Fam, this shit gets the job done. Not a lot of variety for a Chinese buffet, but what they do have is on point.  Favorites are General Tso's and sweet and sour chicken.  The veggies are really good. Their fruit game is not always on point and their soup's are weak as fuck.  But for 8 bucks the lunch and 9 the dinner, this joint the real deal."}
{"text":"Ok, I've read these silly reviews.  This place is not catered to American Chinese Food.  If you want something good & tasty, get the steam chicken or soy sauce chicken.  If you know authentic Chinese dishes then menu has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"I'm sorry that i even have to give this restaurant a star at all. Every time I have eaten here food has been very poor and the service too. My boyfriend ordered the a Shrimp Dumpling Soup and when he took a bite he didn't even think it was shrimp, and me being culinary school, could not identify it. Today I ordered the Gen. Tso's Chicken...mistake. I was over fried and there was a lot of fried bits of breading on my plate and the chicken was greasy when you bit into. Onto the service...the owner, he takes the orders, is very bossy and quite frankly he does not make you feel comfortable in his restaurant at all. I do NOT recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"By far the worst buffet I have ever been to. Where to start? First of all, I payed 16 dollars for my friend and I, which is decently cheap. However, I thought it was strange you pay first. Then I understood as I was presented a 1 isle buffet that is very basic, and very sad. Honestly, the only good item I had was the general tsaos. My egg roll tasted strange like tequila, my egg drop soup was an oily mess, the cheese wonton was a fried wonton wrap with nothing inside, and to top it off, the fruit had mold. My first experience eating in pittsburgh was a bad one. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is fairly low quality, but the prices reflect what you get. General Tso's with lots of breading, chewy pork and beef, overcooked vegetables, and everything is swimming in very sugary sauce.

That being said, I think Golden Palace is great comfort food on the days where I don't feel particularly great about myself and I want to see how much Americanized-Chinese food I can fit in my body for $8."}
{"text":"They have a reasonably good spread for non vegetarians and a smaller one for vegetarians but the staff and waiters were really nice and made us a few veg dishes. As for the food the taste was okay I felt. But my friends thought it was really good. So yeah they gave a good spread if you're really hungry and also they gave a discount if you're a student. So if you did therm you're ID they'll give you a discount as well."}
{"text":"While the selection isn't huge, what is there is a perfect selection and very very good.  I was shocked at the quality.  The lo mein was terrific and actually had texture instead of being a greasy mess like at most buffets and restaurants.  The staff was extremely nice and I recommend dining here if you are interested in a Chinese buffet that has great quality food.

All of the chicken dishes were great, the veggies were excellent too.  I did not try the fish, though it looked good as well.  The price for the buffet was ridiculously low too, so don't let the price and buffet size fool you.  You'll be more than happy with what is there."}
{"text":"Not really a large selection.  Food is not bad but not very flavorful.  Drinks were a joke. Watery tea and lemonade.  First buffet I ever ordered dinner someplace else after going.  Might be out of business if college kids were more picky.  One good note.  Noodles were ok."}
{"text":"The price is acceptable, but the food is so so. Only few kinds of food you can eat in the buffet. I have to say, the food taste not good, so the price is not fair enough. The only reason that I choose to come is because there is soup while you having food."}
{"text":"For a cheap, no frills Chinese Buffet, this place rocks. There's about 20 items on the buffet. All of them are yummy. Went their with my Mom and my Child and we all got full. They have a standard setup of stuff plus 2-3 items that they rotate depending on the day of the week. We went on Monday where they had Char Siu (Roast Pork) and Chow Fun.

You would be surprised that a little hole in the wall buffet like this has such decent grub but you need to check it out."}
{"text":"I go weekly with my BF ....the staffs exceptional ....very friendly....work VERY hard for probably a couple $$ tips on the high end.  I really like buffet.  The green beans are my all time fav.  I want the recipe!!!   Go to a good restaurant with caring people that doesn't break the bank.  Stop the haters!!!"}
{"text":"Open all the time. Good Chinese for what it is. Could be cheaper but it's reasonable."}
{"text":"Can't argue with a $7 buffet... gotta love all you can eat greasy americanized Chinese food.

Do not expect a huge selection for the price, but they serve all the staples you'd want here, like general tso's, different veggies/protein combos + brown/white sauce,  soups though their hot and sour is pretty subpar, noodles, etc. The food is just okay, barely average to be honest, but for all you can eat at this price, this is more than acceptable. While I wouldn't normally want to come here to eat, I see great appeal for a hungry student on a tight budget, who probably lives right around the corner, too."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say! The buffet was very limited and seemed empty for most of the part. In addition, the food was luke warm/cold. The hot and sour soup I thought would be good but was watered down, and lacked flavor. The waitress was kind though and provided us drinks and cleared our table in a timely manner. Just wish the experience was better. I guess if you eat cheap food you get cheap quality food!"}
{"text":"Although it is listed as a buffet restaurant here, Golden Palace has really bad Chinese buffet. The dishes are really oily and the meat is very dry. 

However, it has really good authentic Chinese dishes and lunch boxes, if you order from the menu. You get a lot of food for the money you pay, and some of them are cooked in a healthy and light way.
I'd recommend the soy sauce chicken and roasted duck. They have bigger portion for takeout or appetizer and smaller portion for lunch boxes. They usually put broccoli in the lunch box, but you can ask them to change it to something else if they have."}
{"text":"$8.50 for the buffet (i think it's cheaper if you're a Pitt student).  If you go in with low expectations you'll enjoy it.  It's a good place for college students to pig out of greasy Chinese food.  There's a pretty limited selection for a buffet, so if you're looking for something specific this might not be the place for you. 

I think there were just two people running the whole place.  One was cooking, the other was running the register, seating people and bussing tables after people left.  I actually see this as a good thing, sometimes it annoying being interrupted every few minutes by the waiter asking if you need anything, or refilling a drink.  I thought it was nice that they just leave everyone alone.

This was my first time there, but it sort of had a coffee shop feel in the sense that there were several people sitting alone studying.  It was also very quiet compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my first review since I moved to Pittsburgh a couple weeks ago. (Portland to Pittsburgh) So, of course I had to give my first to someplace worthy.
My mom asked if I wanted to go eat at her favorite Chinese buffet. 
I was a little skeptical at first, because we all know buffets could be hit or miss. 
But when she said it was only $8.50 for dinner, I said why not, let's try it out.
Upon entering we were warmly greeted. 
You pay right when you walk in and pick any seats that are available. 
And then, you DIG In. 
They have a large selection of all the common American Chinese foods. 
Lo mein, chicken + broccoli, egg drop soup etc. 
My personal favorites (I have been there a couple times now, and get multiple plates) are the General tso's chicken, the garlic green beans, and the wonton soup, which is chicken based btw! 
All flavorful and delicious. 
But really the green beans are addicting- perfectly cooked, slightly crunchy and full of flavor. I could eat a whole plate of just green beans. 
If something is running low and you want more, just ask. They make everything in house and are happy to stock you up. 
Drinks are included. They have a soda fountain and hot tea. 
The last time I went I had two big plates of food. 
And because everyone is always skeptical of buffets. 
No, I did not have any stomach issues after any of the times I went. All good! 
The last time we went I was so full but the friendly lady who works there was like are you going to get dessert, I will make fresh donuts. I said I couldn't possibly eat anymore but low and behold she made a whole pan of fresh donuts for everyone who was eating. They were going quick, college kids left and right grabbing two at a time, so of course I changed my mind and grabbed one. 
For sure worth it. 
Fresh hot pipping donuts, definitely enough to fulfill a sweet tooth without being overly sweet. 
So next time if she asks if I want donuts, the answer will be yes!!! 
My mother and I vowed to now come here for some cheap eats a couple times a month. 
We love it, and I hope you will too."}
{"text":"Extremely small selection and what they did have wasn't great. Didn't feel well after. Avoid."}
{"text":"I heeded the advice of several reviewers and did not partake in the all you can eat buffet; I ordered from the menu instead. The hot and sour soup was good but it lacked a little flavor. Not heat, flavor. Perhaps because it has a vegetarian rather than poultry or pork base. The eggplant and garlic sauce was quite good and plentiful. The fried rice that came with it however was tasteless and sticky. I think because it is made in such large quantities, to supply the buffet, it is not of the highest quality.
The deep fried squid with spicy salt was very good, as was the roasted duck.
I think the key here is to order items that are freshly made in small quantities. The restaurant has an extensive menu. 
This restaurant is close to where I live, so chances are I will be back."}
{"text":"You know, after going back to the convention for a second year and eating at the Golden Palace Buffet again, I have to say that ordering off of the menu provided a significant improvement over the buffet.

The food wasn't nearly as greasy and was actually quite flavorful.  I was pleased with my meal and I'm sure my friends were, too.  My friend, who was wearing a giant costume, was treated with courtesy."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this Buffet! The food is always fresh!  The staff is constant changing out the hots on the buffet.  They have a good selection of items and the buffet line is kept very clean.  

The price is unbeatable too! the lunch buffet is only $7 for all you can eat.  Take out is available as well.  

Looks can be deceiving.  The Golden Palace is divey.  It is a little hole in the wall in Oakland.  Parking is a pain but the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Quick food. Good service...
My boyfriend will lecture me about leaving tips, I WORK IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. I know ALL about leaving good tips, 20% every time. Maybe even a little extra depending on the service. 15% if you truly sucked. (To Blunt?) That's my philopshy, you get what you work for. Long story short, he leaves amazing tips, and ranted and raved about this place, leading us to this review. He always says leave an amazing tip, they will remember you every time, and you'll get amazing service every time. Well don't ya know? This old Asian women lights up when he comes in. He hasn't been there in over a year. We order our food, he ordered the dumplings, and general tso's. I ordered the roasted duck and the egg rolls. Now I wish I would of gotten what he had, their dumplings, yes were a little greasy as were the egg rolls, but what do you expect? It's a chinese buffet. His general tso's on the other hand amazing as were the dumplings, which reminded me more of pot stickers but any-hoo. My roasted duck, was a little bit of a disappointment. I don't mind a few bones, but there was bone after bone, it was very hard to eat. Talk about rustic chinese food. I'd go back but I wouldn't order the duck, dry and no sauce."}
{"text":"My review is based on price I paid today. Today (Friday) I wanted to eat out without any worries of looking at the menu. So I reached this place at 8:30pm I guess they close at 9:00pm. Food are not of much varieties and taste okay. The restaurent was pretty empty. The lady smiled and greeted me. No serving water, My plates were.not picked not a great service but It does not much.bother me. As long as people smile and talk and charge me only 8dollar and something for a dinner after tax."}
{"text":"I have indeed experienced better.  I usually eat upstairs which I would rate at 3 or 4 stars, however this time I decided to try their first floor take-out menu and that was a mistake.  I ordered General Tso with Fried Rice to go, I expected a 10 to 15 minute wait ... I waited 4 minutes.  That should have been my first warning flag.  I walked back to my office and opened it, the smell seemed a little off.  A couple bites into the meal I simply had to stop eating.  At first I just thought I was being picky ... but then a couple co-workers confirmed the food smelled funky.  So ... yeah ... one-star until proven otherwise."}
{"text":"Really greasy but if that's what you're looking for it tastes quite good!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the Golden Palace Buffet in Oakland on Forbes Ave. 
Apparently owned by same family .  Downtown location has sloppy-er presented/made food .  They used to have fried chicken but have gotten stingy and no longer do ."}
{"text":"an excellent no-frills Chinese buffet.
$8.25+ tax for lunch & re-fillable soda pop , 7 days a week, last I knew .  (most buffets upcharge for weekend meals...)
Go on Saturday/Sunday when they put the fried chicken out - some of the best fried chicken i've ever had ... they only do it on the weekends, however ...
You will see doctors, nurses, Lifeflight pilots, professors, college kids and every other ilk of humanity chowing away on a given day for lunch ... and a LOT of Chinese/Asian people that seem to have given it their stamp of approval - always a good sign ...
One of my favorite / go-to chow spots in town even if I have to deal with the ugly Oakland traffic / parking situation ...Guess it depends on which cook is making the food, that day."}
{"text":"I have been dining at the Golden Palace Buffet since I was in high school. This is a favorite lunch  spot for me and my friends and family. Upstairs they have a lunch buffet, all you can eat for less than $7.00 dollars.  During the lunch the buffet is always packed and sometimes you have to wait just a little bit to get a table.  

  Anywhere from 2 to some times 3 nights a week I get dinner here, while I'm working.  Lately I have grown fond of the combination lo mien, and crispy crab rangoons. The servings here are  very  generous, I only regret that that the brown sauce doesn't adhere to the lo mien noodles that well. In some dishes I have had in the past the veggies were limp and tasted as if they had been made hours before.  

Because of having items like beer and broccoli that was less than stellar I haven't been to adventurous with trying other menu options.  The shrimp fried rice also leaves a lot to be desired. 

But because the proximity of this restaurant is so close to my  job, I eat there when I want Chinese."}
{"text":"The owner cracks me up lol I managed to call the fax number and not phone number a couple of times when tryng to place an order, now he always jokes with me when I come in. 

I have been going there since I was in highschool and all in all it's solid food nothing exciting but you get what you paid for. 

This resturant has a lot of sentimental value for me. In this resturant  my boyfriend first said he loved me. So Golden Palace Buffet will always have a special place in my heart. 

 The food is okay I especially like their combination lo-mien I have never had any of their speciality menu selections.

I enjoy their hot and sour soup and orange chicken is tasty hunan shrimp and beef and brocoli. 

For Chinese food downtown it's pretty okay"}
{"text":"a good place for lunch, quick and close and fair priced. there black pepper pork is my favorite the only thing they could do better would be add more vegetable in there. i did pay an extra $1 for the vegetable one time and it had way too much garlic in there for a work day."}
{"text":"Food choices are very limited. Was expecting more for a Chinese buffet. Waiters/waitresses don't really make too much of an effort to take away dirty dishes. This is just a very mediocre place to go eat Chinese, although I could see how the cheap price point helps to attract college students looking for cheap grub. However, there are other places that are better for Chinese food. Save your money."}
{"text":"went to eat the buffet ... and got free entertainment from mice, mice,mice..beware they have mice.....when i went to pay....i told the lady , as everyone else did..the lady all of a sudden ''speak no english'''..........as she was told about the mice........but was very quick to point out that 'tip not included''..................please not go ever............................"}
{"text":"Really great option for cantonese food in Oakland. I've never ordered from the buffet (it doesn't look too good), but they make an a-ok congee (no donuts, unfortunately), reasonably good roast duck & pork, and the fish maw soup is also very nice.

It's near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it's not crowded. The interior is kind of beat (drop-ceiling, battered furniture, etc), but I really like the laid-back atmosphere. 

This is my favorite place for a secret 90-minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes. Just arrive after 1pm!"}
{"text":"Greasy is what it is. Even their noodle soup and dumplings taste oily and unpleasant. Their congee was ok. Good price and friendly waitress are the only good things about this place."}
{"text":"Very solid, simple food. Highly recommend the General Tso's...best, thickest sauce I've ever seen at a buffet and very flavorful. The street noodles and spicy chicken are also very solid entries.

The service is fine (they'll come and grab dishes pretty quickly) and there's always a decent spot to sit."}
{"text":"Cheap but decent buffet place. Not a huge selection but it was cheap and the food was decent. The food station is set up in the middle of the room with seating hugging the walls. Mostly four tops but they had at least on large table for groups. There's a soda station in the back as well as hot tea included."}
{"text":"The food is pretty bad. I've been to Chinese buffets that were kind of decent, but this isn't one of them. Soggy General Tso's, soggy rolls, soggy noodles. The pork did not please my stomach in any way. 

It's a Chinese buffet. Use your brain."}
{"text":"I had previously came here with a friend during lunch. We went to the second floor for buffet. But boy was I disappointed! The food did not taste good at all, the selection was very limited and the place did not look like it was clean enough. I decided not to ever come back but decided to give it another try to see if the food that was to order was better. We went to the first floor to check it out. To our surprise, they had a Chinese menu (limited dishes). I ordered one of my favorite dishes which was thick noodles with beef. The food came 15 minutes later. The serving amount was little and it didn't look like they had put much on it. It was supposed to have things like carrots, bean sprouts, broccoli or veggies but it didn't have much. The noodles tasted like nothing, it had no flavor and it didn't look too appetizing.  On top of that, it was over $10 for that dish. Overall, did not enjoy the food there."}
{"text":"Ok so you might wonder why I gave this little buffet 5 stars ...I am going to tell you all you need to know before you decide to go there for a meal
first off the price 
it was $8.50 for dinner
so with that being typed yes its worth every penny
very friendly people work there and warmly greet you when you come in
its not such a big place and its very bland looking inside 
the buffet is in the middle of the room
there are some red lanterns adoring the ceiling
ok this buffet is not huge there are not so many items BUT here is why this is a 5 star in my book
THE FOOD IS GOOD
its good straight  food
egg rolls filled with veggies; nice think how you remember them fried thick dough
lomein (vegetable) its good
fried rice (vegetable)its good
rice noodles
and my favorite the fried tofu triangles perfect for a vegetarian like me
the sauce was so good and savory I could lick the plate
there are the real classics here
chicken & broccoli, sweet & sour chicken 
egg drop soup
duck sauce you can ladle onto your plate 
buffet comes with self serve soda & ice tea
for dessert there was nice fresh melon and nice fresh little fried sugar donuts. They call them biscuits I call them yum
There is something very comforting about this place from the gals working there ...coming from the kitchen wearing an apron and holding a pot of nice fresh food to add to the buffet.
This food is fresh and homemade.
Having grown up with a Grandma that lived just a few block from the real China Town of Manhattan this is the real deal ol fashion classic Chinese and now I am so hungry for their egg rolls I need to eat there again soon.
Metered parking on the street."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place is one of the better places to get your Chinese food fix--the american style fix that is"}
{"text":"THERE WAS A MOUSE IN THE CELING LIGHTING RAFTERS DO NOT GO HERE. I repeat do not go here. 

Pointed out the mouse to the restaurant staff and the woman just ignored it and continued to ring customers out. Even the police and everyone in the restaurant just stopped eat. Absolutely discusting."}
{"text":"My last review was a while back, but I've been frequenting this place more as of late, so my impressions of it have definitely changed! The buffet food is pretty much the same as it was all this time, but it's still an okay deal considering the selection. I still think most of it is of questionable quality, stir-fried with lots of grease and sodium, but that's what you'd expect. The everyday items are nothing to write home about (General Tso, Hunan pork/chicken, beef broccoli, etc.), but they usually have a couple items that are more \"authentic\" and rotate daily. These vary from fried fish to soft scrambled eggs to Cantonese bbq pork or soy sauce chicken. Again, not the best you'll find anywhere, but decent considering the lack of Cantonese food in Pittsburgh.

We've also experimented ordering from the regular menu, with mixed results. Many of their items are surprisingly Cantonese and affordable. Things like wonton noodle soup (Chinese wonton, which is quite different from the Americanized version), beef brisket, and bbq meat noodle and rice plates are all offered. The wonton noodles were surprisingly good, with the skin quite thin and the stuffing very savory--might it even be homemade? The beef brisket noodles were mediocre at best; savory broth, but very tough meat. So there'll probably be more experimenting to do in future visits."}
{"text":"This place is either a buffet or a regular Chinese restaurant.  I tried the buffet and the food was good, but the selection was very limited. I think they maybe had 15 choices.  

But the price was so reasonable that I needed to leave this review for anyone who is in downtown Pittsburg looking for a cheap meal. My friend and I walked out of there spitting the bill at $10 each including tip."}
{"text":"Screw you haters. I don't know what exactly you expect from a Chinese Buffet, but this has all the essentials. 

The food was very very satisfying. From the lo mein, to the general tso's, all the way to the soups and the watermelon, everything was very very tasty.

Additionally, they have great customer service and helpful staff!!!!

The buffet was $8. It was a steal in my opinion.

Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"I don't typically do Chinese buffets.

But this one came highly recommended.

Rather, the conversation was \"I cannot believe you have worked in Oakland for 6 years and have never gone here.  We went here every Friday!\"

and when venturing out to lunch today without a plan, I suggested this place.  Worth a shot I guess.

My first impression was the cantaloupe - it was good and in season.  But ok...getting to the actual Chinese food...    

I had the chicken and broccoli, the general tso's, an egg roll, some of their fried mushrooms with sweet and sour sauce, some vegetable lo mien, a 'biscuit', and some fried dumpling with a creamy filling that tasted somewhat like onions.  

Overall very good.  The lo mien and the mushrooms were the best.  The 'biscuit' is the 'Chinese donut' type - spongy with sugar. It was typical.  The general tso's was surprisingly good.  To me, general tso's is often too gooped up in sweet and sour sauce with rubbery chicken that tastes like it was microwaved.  No, this was pretty good.  The egg roll...yeah that's the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of, but overall, $6.26 for a full buffet and a drink.  You can't beat that, AND now I've found a Chinese buffet that actually has decent food.   Yay.

For reference, there were a bunch of Asian people eating there - I tend to use that as a marker for how authentic/edible the food is.   I like to think I'd be a pretty good judge of pizza or hamburgers in China if the tables were turned."}
{"text":"I come to downtown Pittsburgh annually for a convention and I eat here at least once per trip. I've ordered from the regular menu in previous years and only noticed this year that they were also having a dinner buffet. The buffet part of this restaurant is actually fairly mundane. The selection is smaller than most Chinese buffets I've been to. From the regular menu, on the other hand, the pan fried noodles are pretty decent."}
{"text":"I was walking by and the sweet smell of \"Chinese\" food captured me. I went for the buffet because I was pretty hungry. Now, for a fair warning, this is not real Chinese food because nearly everything was deep-fried candy General Tso's and imitation crab ragoons. I knew what to expect, that is why I am giving this place three stars. You know when sometimes for breakfast you get the itch to go order a bunch of donuts even though you should be eating 2 slices of 100% whole wheat bread? It was kind of like that since I hadn't eaten this kind of crap in a while. It fulfilled the indulgence. So, pretty much what I saw were all the American classics like General Tso's chicken, Sweet and Sour pork, beef and broccoli, and some others with some steamed and fried rice. Most of it tasted pretty horrible, as was to be expected, but I rather enjoyed the General Tso's chicken and the fried rice.

It's not the classiest of joints, but what can you really expect for $7.50? The waitress gave pretty good service (she seemed sweet too)

{"text":"Really big restaurant with traditional and classic decorations. The atmosphere is quite relaxing. The number of kinds of food is not big enough but the dishes are quite tasty. The amount of food is not very big while the price is fair. The time of food being prepared and served is way too long but the waiters and the boss are very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Don't judge a run down old storefront by its run down old storefront!  This is a decent Chinese restaurant.

My husband and I are new residents to downtown Pittsburgh.  We were reluctant to try this place because it looks dodgy from the outside.  Around 7:30pm one randomness Thursday night, we decided to give it a whirl.  The buffet is only open for lunch and for dinner, we were the only patrons there...they clearly do a busier lunch crowd.

Our expectations were low and WOW were we a bit surprised.  Make no mistake, for inviting storefront and welcoming and updated decor and ambiance, they get a 0 ( that is a zero!).  It's clean, just dated.  For authentic Chinese dishes with a voice variety of options, they get a solid 4!

Staff was friendly and spoke Cantonese.  We shared a variety of dishes and all were authentic and good.  We will go again."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and delicious! If you like quantity, and you like good tasting food, GP is your place!"}
{"text":"The buffet here is incredibly lacking. 
While the price is quite tempting, there's something about sitting in a poorly decorated and horribly lit room full of stale food that rubs me the wrong way. 

The service is nice and friendly and will make more food upon request. You do get free access to the soda dispenser and tea which is a plus. 
However when it comes to the food...
There are hardly any vegetarian options so if you're a veggie lover expect to dine on soggy fruit and 2 or 3 vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try again after a few years.  The buffet still is pretty bad.  The buffet is small and the food quality is 2 stars at best.  I hold the 1 stars for absolute disasters.   Food has little taste.  Interesting there is no seafood (shrimp) on the buffet.  The wonton soup is chicken. Most of the vegetables are soggy.  Pork was \"bad\".  Chicken dishes were OK but were mostly dark meat.  

It does a decent business including carryout. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The price is fine, pretty mediocre though as far as cheap chinese buffets go. The eggrolls were undercooked."}
{"text":"Pretty good place... as long as you don't get the buffet. It's common knowledge amongst the Asian folks that you need to order from the menu.

Canto-style food. The fried tofu is good and is coated in a fairly unique batter. The other dishes are less notable but fairly tasty. Preparation and presentation is a kinda coarse. My friends and I usually ordered from a small subset of the menu: fried tofu, salt and pepper pork chops, salt and pepper squid, some pig intestine dish I forget the name of, char siu pork, 8 treasure clay pot.

Tip: If you're picky, ask the waitress when the char siu was made. Being Pittsburgh, it may take a few days before the old batch is finished and the new batch is prepared.

The Golden Palace in downtown has the same food and owners."}
{"text":"I went during hour before closing, so your mileage may vary. Cashier comped me a 10% discount (I think students get this discount anytime) bringing the buffet to $7 which includes drinks. Everyone there except one table were Asian students. 

The buffet itself was a selection of the most common Chinese dishes like Hunan/Kung Pao chicken, green beans, hot and sour soup, wonton soup. The food was all OK, nothing to distinguished.

Looking at the reviews I probably should have ordered off the menu, but I was hungry and its hard to beat the service time of a buffet."}
{"text":"I had been dining here for many years and enjoyed it very much.  The place was plain and small, offering no ambience, but good and ample food was a staple.  April 19, 2018, I was disappointed to find that it is gone, now a Burger King.  Apparently the Oakland location remains open.  Does anyone know what happened?"}
{"text":"This is a best-kept secret gem!  There is nothing fancy about the place; this is not one of the huge, sparkling clean, modern Chinese buffets which offer hundreds of choices and the restaurant does not attract an elite clientele for the most part, but its 20 or so dishes, including soups, are awfully good with a touch of uniqueness!   I love the chow fun wide noodles, sweet tofu in sauce, chicken with broccoli, mixed vegetables, egg roll, breaded chicken, and breaded mushrooms.  For the bargain lunch price of $8.00 including tax, one can enjoy a feast, and credit cards are now accepted!  I also appreciated the pleasant and welcoming demeanor of the middle aged lady who worked the front register.  I wish I had more of an opportunity to dine here!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.
A place worthy a $6.7(7 for credit cards) buffet with a drink. Chickens(orange, hot, General Tso's) are generally good. As others comments have mentioned, more greasy and oily than expected. Do not get too much meat and try to have veges to \"neutralize.\" Rice noodle is a great choice if you have too much meat like me. 
Anyway, you cannot criticize a $7 buffet that is as good as this one."}
{"text":"A historical review.  When we lived in Pgh this was the best Chinese food we ever had. It still is. This place is the only establishment that knows how to make General Tso's Tofu and make it right. This is the only place that I have ever seen it on the menu. The Tso's like Potatoes are also great! Love their hot and sour soup and their green beans. How they get them so perfect is beyond me.  I miss this place. I wish we had a Chinese buffet as good as this down the road from our new home. Miss it. Yum!"}
{"text":"Go elsewhere.

I was needing some General Tso's and other Americanized Chinese fare for lunch.  Having already tried one place downtown and coming up short I figured I'd give Golden Palace a try.  Fail.  Golden Palace's buffet is on a table that measures 15' x 3' and doesn't offer much variety.  This would make me think the limited choices make for better food.  Wrong.
The food housed on this small table is not fresh, is not tasty, and is not appealing.  I was almost tempted to just ask for my money back.  Instead I rolled the dice and tried the General Tso's, the fried rice, and the chicken and peppers.  Hope you like gristle, salt, and high fructose corn syrup because it's all you're going to taste.

Bleck.

Golden Palace is also expensive.

{"text":"This place is my jam! I love going to lunch here! The food is always fresh and the tables are always clean. I really enjoy the lunch buffet. I would suggest everyone try it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm saying this - I actually really enjoyed the food here! I've talked a lot of smack on GPB over the years, but I have to admit, their buffet was legit. Sure, the selection was very small, but what they did have tasted great. This is the ONLY buffet in all of Pittsburgh that has tofu (and it's general tso's tofu! my favorite!). That was enough to impress me. The noodles was flavorful without being too greasy, and the fried rice was delicious (and it's not that weird neon yellow rice either). The buffet also features 2 vegetable sides - mixed veggies and green beans - so vegetarians have a good amount of items to select from. Everyone out there with a sweet tooth will be disappointed because their dessert selection is non-existent. 

The service is the reason I'm knocking off a star. The lady was simply rude and not a single plate was cleared the entire time we were there. The buffet is set up so that it can be 100% self-service. You get your own silverware, your own food, and your own drinks. This is actually sort of nice because you get free soft drinks and you can refill whenever you want without awkwardly trying to flag down a waitress from across the room. My boyfriend and I usually like to dine without much disturbance, so we actually preferred being ignored by the staff. 

Golden Palace really impressed me today! Great vegetarian selections, unbeatable price, mehh on the service, but overall, I had a very enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. It doesn't taste horrible but it's definitely not anything special. I had the lunch buffet which was around $8.50 with tax. I would say my favorites were probably their green beans, egg rolls, and cheese wontons. But then again, I think if you get any of those wrong, it's kinda hopeless. Everything was okay and edible and I had a little bit of everything. Their selection is smaller than most but they have the big stuff: General Tso's chicken, chicken with broccoli, lo mein, etc. I did not like their hot and sour soup at all and the fruit looked a little off so I didn't have any of it.

Everything is self serve, which I did not mind at all. The lady working the register was super super super nice and she made me feel very welcome and was very friendly (which I think is very rare!). I probably would just opt for take out at a different restaurant next time because they're the same price comparatively, but if I was in the mood for a cheap buffet, for $8.50, this is not really the worst option available. It's a convenient location on campus and it's usually pretty quiet so yeah..."}
{"text":"I had fond memories of Golden Palace from my child hood.  My folks worked downtown across the street, we love chinese food and we were regulars.  Sad to say, over the years Golden Palace has tarnished to a Rusty Bronze Shanty.

The best of the food was mediocre and the worst was inedible.  Most was extremely over salted, nothing was fresh, and the vegetables were soggy, overcooked, and disgusting.  I feel like my happy child hood memories have been stolen away.  I'll cross my fingers that in another few years they rise like the phoenix from the ashes back to their former culinary glory!"}
{"text":"Has okay 'lunch menu' specials and has a good location for Downtown workers, as well as a buffet."}
{"text":"I am in like with this place. Greasy, sweet American Chinese Food is a new classic and this place kinda nails it. It is not super clean or sophisticated, it just does what it is supposed to do. Go and stuff your face and get along with your day. No glitz and glamor here, just some straight up gluttony.

By the way, don't get the takeout boxes from the buffet. It makes you look like a ween."}
