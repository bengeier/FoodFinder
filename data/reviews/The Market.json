{"text":"I'm not one to fling around perfect ratings based on just one visit, but this place made such a great impression on me there was just no alternative. I had the salade niçoise and a side of the herb fries ... MY GOD SO TASTY. The salad had perfectly seared sashimi-grade yellowfin tuna, and the dressing was light and perfect. The fries ... I have no idea how they got the fries so crispy and delicious. After lunch I bought pretty much one of everything from their bakery display case ... their pastry chefs know what they're doing.   I loved the French décor, too. The music was hit and miss though, but no big deal.   Oh, it's not visible from the street, really. It's on the southwest corner of the strip mall. The main entrance faces south."}
{"text":"The breakfast and lunch sandwiches are delicious and the hot food bar has a solid selection. I stopped by once during my stay and kept coming back thanks to the food and service. Kevin was the best.   I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"There for Sunday brunch, my expectations were dashed when the server told me that the salmon dish I was ordering was not available, and neither were beignets, burgers, barbeque chicken, or kabobs.  That said, the gnocchi dish was good, as was the posole.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Rustic,elegant,spacious,delicious, and unique local recipes/entrees! 1st  visit for our foodie group- already confirmed date for return trip! Great for lunch- will also try happy hour/dinner...loved our server, very informative, and happy to meet Jennifer!"}
{"text":"The hot food bar in convenient. It is pricey for the type of food being served. The staff is nice sometimes, depending on who is helping you. They have sandwiches you can order to be made too. Which are pretty good. There is a sitting area to eat inside or outside. There is also a nice stock of groceries you can buy.  Two stars knocked off for inconsistent service and for being expensive."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the live entertainment was so loud (Saturday at lunchtime) that is was nigh unto impossible to hear what others at the table were saying unless they leaned forward and shouted, which was very annoying and certainly detracted from our party's experience."}
{"text":"Happy to have them in the neighborhood. Have tried just about all the boards and they are fabulous, great wine selection. Smores board is amazing. Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. Love the patio. And the free chips."}
{"text":"David and his staff have really pulled something amazing off in their new restaurant/ market! The menu is delish and plays to people who has special dietary needs such as paleo, gluten free, and vegetarian. We tried the fried chicken and beignets( Seitan mock fried chicken) I'm not vegetarian but it was amazing.   We also tried the eggs Benedict w sweet potato hash.  So yummy.  As a Summerlin resident, I would venture down town again  for this.  Side note: their market carries 80 different craft beers! They serve Peet's coffee & tea too!"}
{"text":"This is a great find and a great addition to the Arcadia area! My family stopped in for lunch  and was very pleased with our meals. I had the Cuban which was great and my husband had their burger. You can tell they are using fresh ingredients and there is a lot of attention to detail in the entire experience. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their nosh boards! It seems like a great spot to bring a group of friends for drinks (great wine selection) and we def want to come back and check out brunch which they serve until 5pm- bonus!  This place really deserves some love from CenPho people and I hope you all check it out!"}
{"text":"Epic fail Will NEVER patronize your business again. You should have paid us to spend our time and money there. At least offered dessert on the house? Cant waste my time detailing your failures. Embarrassed for you.  Yelp wont allowed  zero stars so I am forced to give you 1."}
{"text":"Love this place!! There was a group here right before us who gave Jennifer a bad review but they were not nice. I've been coming here for a while and it's consistent and delicious!! The atmosphere is beautiful and with the nice weather it's fantastic!! We love Jenny!"}
{"text":"Happened by this hidden gem and decided to stop for dinner. They have live music and they just started all day happy hour on Thursdays. I had the beef tenderloin which was made perfectly!  Also the wedge salad which is made with butter lettuce instead of iceberg.  I like that much better.  Recommend and will return.  The rest of the menu is very interesting."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and it was great! Great in every way.  Darling setting, great friendly service.  Lots of choices.  Everything we ordered and everything we saw others receive were gorgeous!  Our food was wonderful.  Portions nice and prices reasonable.  What more could you ask for?  Thanks to everyone at Jennifers.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I hired Jennifer's Catering for my parent's 50th wedding anniversary party, and they were fantastic. They made everything effortless for me, so I could enjoy the party. They were always looking for ways to help me out, and ways to make my guest's experiences even more enjoyable. The food was wonderfully delicious, the bartender was friendly and went above and beyond, and the rest of the crew was just as friendly and professional. They certainly exceeded my expectations and I would definitely hire them again."}
{"text":"What a refreshing afternoon.  Had never heard of The Market.  Drove by, it looked friendly and so happy we stopped.  Greeted by Caleb who had terrific menu suggestions.  Bacon-wrapped prawns with fry bread and sauce; cheese platter with pears, local honey and homemade crackers; and a fresh warm bread and butter assortment.  Then came the tortilla soup.  Wow.  Just wonderful.  Creamy tomato base, gentle seasoning with succulent cheese and shredded chicken. Yum.  A leisurely afternoon of nibbling and chat. Owner Jen made sure we were happy and Richard came by the table and talked about local resources.  Just a comfy time.  Couldn't recommend the total experience more highly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem!  The food was the best!  I had shrimp and grits and it was the best I've ever had and I lived in Charleston SC where it's home to shrimp and grits. Served in an iron skillet and done to perfection. Butternut squash soup was superb. Beautiful presentation, too. Dessert was cookies and chocolate milk. Hot chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin made with golden Raisins. Our server Caleb was the best!  He made our adventure much better by making sure we had what we needed. The atmosphere and ambience was so fun. If you don't try this place you are truly missing out on a great place to eat and enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and have been excitingly awaiting it to open. I had friends in town for the weekend and so we decided this place would be perfect for a late Sunday lunch. I was very impressed when I walked in. They put a lot of thought and effort in creating an awesome atmosphere.  We ordered the butternut squash soup, a burger, yellow tail tuna salad, chicken schnitzel sandwich and the Cuban sandwich and shared everything. The soup and chicken sandwich was good, the tuna on the salad seemed off and we couldn't put our finger on what it was about the consistency that just seemed off, I didn't like the Cuban but everyone else said it was just OK and we all thought the burger was horrible. Everything on the burger was bland except the burnt onion. The meat had no flavor AT ALL.  I feel that there was a lot of effort put into the atmosphere and the menu was an afterthought. I doubt I will be going back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!  Locally sourced, great service, country breakfast chic and they even play football on the big TV along side your aromatic surgars (locally made)."}
{"text":"I am so excited about the wings. OMG. Even better - by checking in on yelp we get an order free today!  Everything I've had here has been wonderful."}
{"text":"If you are open until 10pm, I believe you should still offer sandwiches until 10pm. And you should not charge $10 for a box of quinoa.   I do, however, like their food bar for lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE finally having a grocery store downtown. Their selection is kinda limited, but they carry all the staples. You won't find exotic stuff here, but it's definitely good for your basic weekly grocery run. Their sandwiches are pretty good, too."}
{"text":"So happy to have this in the neighborhood! I've been there several times and not been disappointed once. I can see how Jennifer has been a long-time successful caterer.   The Cuban sandwich is plentiful and delicious. The asparagus, burratta, and prosciutto salad is a nice light offering but still satisfying. Butternut squash soup hit the spot. I enjoyed the fresh shrimp po boy - the shrimp was not fried - which made it feel healthier.  I'm not a huge fan of the nosh boards, the corn chips are nothing special and the combination is a bit weird.    Do try the brownie cookies, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Wonderful Sunday Brunch! We arrived as a group of 12 around 1:00 pm.  We were seated quickly, welcomed generously, and brought coffee and drinks quickly.  All around, everyone agreed the food was top-notch.  And we sampled a wide range of offerings.  The eggs were amazingly fresh tasting, and served on top of enchiladas, as well as other dishes.  The fresh tuna on the niscoise salad was rare and delicious. Etc., etc. The service was incredibly attentive, friendly and helpful.  When my order for chilequilas was mixed up, it was corrected in just a few minutes, so I wasn't left behind to finish last.  And the server gave me a free cookie to acknowledge his mistake.  For which I felt he redeemed himself. I would recommend this jewel of restaurant without reservation (pun intended)!"}
{"text":"Had a salad and it was great!  The lobster Mac was really good but I was only allowed to steal a couple of bites. Went here for lunch and I would love to try brunch. It is a cute little place that is tucked into the strip mall. Please don't let that deter you, it is really a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Market By Jennifer's is one of my recent favorites. Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. If it's not bad enough that everything is over priced. They don't put all their ingredients on their menu. I walked seven blocks to eat there because nothing else sounded good and how could a sandwich be bad? Well it can. It's called mustard. I hate mustard more than anything in this world. When I got back from the market to my job to eat there was mustard all over it. Would've been good to know what exactly was on it not just some of what's on it and whatever they feel like adding. I'll never waste my money there again."}
{"text":"The Market is amazing I was already in love but now I'm over the moon in love. Went in today for my daily Kombucha ($3.69, can't beat the price) and while there recommended to the Manager it would be great if they carried Vegas Allergy Mix (holistic amazing remedy for seasonal allergies) she said she would work on it. 30 mins later I get a post on my FB page that she just got off the phone with them and they will have it in a few weeks. HOLY COW... Thanks for blowing my mind! Happy Dance... Happy Dance!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We stopped off for a smoothie & a sandwich for our drive home from Vegas. Both were very fresh & delicious. The sandwich came with a nice salad. Very clean kitchen & store. Everyone was super nice & i think 4 people made sure someone was helping me. My wife & I visit Vegas several times a year & like to stay downtown. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service was lacking. Place was crowded for lunch on a Friday and understaffed. We were given our food and never checked on again. Not even once. Drinks were never refilled and we waited forever to get our checkered after having to ask for it. Food was so so...we got a sausage and cheese board and a steak salad. The salad was $16 and not worth it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Cute space and decor - this place has potential.   The only reason I am giving this place a low rating because the food was not very good. I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy, it came out cold and the complete opposite of what a Shrimp Po-Boy should taste like. The shrimp was small and cold, the sandwich basically tasted like a salad in a stiff baguette. I was so disappointed, I wanted to cry because I was looking forward to fried shrimp in a warm baguette. For $11 I would expected something amazing.  Definitely not coming here again :("}
{"text":"What a find in the neighborhood!  I had the chicken and polenta and it was over-the-top fabulous.  And the service is wonderful.  What a treat!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our food. The \"hot\" wings were flavorless and not hot at all; they were so disgusting they tasted like they took the wings from the fridge and dumped them in the fryer, didn't even taste like anything but chicken and oil; I didn't eat them so they were taken off my bill.   The steak and eggs were ordered medium well it came out rare and had to be sent back; they remade them and my friend ate it. (This was her 4th time at the market and said this is the 4th time of having bad service/bad food) her other experience was when the quiche was frozen in the middle.   The beer comes in an 18 oz. glass but is only poured halfway so it feels like they cheat you when you look at the glass when ordering a 12oz. beer, I ordered a bud light which was $5 I don't even want to know how much their craft beers are.    Our waitress was nice but she was overworked and running around to other guests most of the time so our table couldn't ask for anything promptly.   It's just not a place I will ever visit again, and telling friends and family not to even bother.  I have been contacted by a manager about my review and he tries blaming me about our party size and that I didn't have to pay for wings, and asked if I could change my stars because I like the band. Excuse me, your band has nothing to do with: food prepared wrong, disgusting wings, overpriced menu, and lack of good timely service.   My one star is for the band. And yelp doesn't allow zero stars."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but it has been a letdown. First visit I ordered a grilled cheese. I waited 20min, and was given a cold cheese sandwich. I brought it back to the counter, and was told that they knew they were having issues with the cook and grilled cheese, and offered to make another. I declined as I didn't want to wait an additional 20min, so they offered a refund instead.   Second visit, I tried to purchase a pre-made sandwich and a beer. You need to have food to order a beer due to liquor license restrictions. One employee stated that I may not be able to order beer with the pre-made sandwich. I was told by another employee that I could order a beer as I was still ordering food, it was just pre-made. I was able to order a beer after all, however no one knew how much they were. To add to the confusion, the cook was also the cashier at a register several feet away from the kitchen.  On both occasions, the staff was nice, albeit clueless. There's an obvious lack of training, management and professionalism. Issues with cooks should be fully addressed before allowing food to make it to customers, and rules regarding beer for consumption on premise should be posted and the staff should know them."}
{"text":"The absolute best brunch we have had in a long time. Perfect quiche, hamburger, chorizo and vegetable omelets. The restaurant was fun and the service outstanding! We even got to meet the manager Ric when he visited our table -- great place Ric and Jennifer, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love this market!  They are SO close to the Fremont Experience & the Hotels on Fremont. This grocery store is like a miniature Whole Foods but more reasonable. They have an unbelievably wide selection, a little of everything in a small space. Their deli/bakery/ready-to-eat section is great. Pizza, salad bar, hot entrees by the pound. Super fresh produce and competitive pricing. Fresh breads, canned goods, dairy, lots of artisan bottled drinks like fresh juices & kombucha. The best part about this market is their customer service.  It's a Groupon that brought me in for my 1st visit.  The cashier was so pleasant and helpful, no rolling eyes as I asked for help, no sneer about the Groupon (unlike many establishments who frown upon those bringing in Groupons, which BTW that business took upon themselves to offer their Groupon).  I highly recommend trying this little local grocery store & more.  I'd love to see them thrive for many years to come."}
{"text":"Great Neighborhood stop to have a drink and bite, many choices on the menu, my eggs with the steak said over easy but need to remind them next time, will order again the steak au poivre, since don't have eggs Benedict, they have a $33 bfast for two with different choices for eggs, from duck to goose.."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Best nicoise salad around. The servers have a great balance between being attentive while also allowing you to just be. Great Vibe. Don't have to valet. This place is a gem in the Arcadia Neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time there.  I will be back.  I had a daily special which was a procutto raviloli with mushrooms and potatoes.  OUTSTANDING meal.   Then my wife and I ordered dessert.  Lemongrass something or other with mangoes and toasted coconut, and a date shake....  OH MY.     Nice place, good wine selection, draft beer, great service, very good food.   What's not to love."}
{"text":"Now that this place is run by the people from bronze cafe...amazing!!! 5 stars! Whats crazy is i think most businesses suck! These people seriously are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were having our usual Wednesday night date night and finally decided to head to The Market. It is very quant, small tables on the patio/ walkway area and several more inside. We had the chips and dips which were very yummy and I had the risotto for dinner. Delicious! My hubby had the burger, and he said it was good. (But, He is a bit of a burger snob, lol). Service was laid back but professional- both men who helped us were great. We will go back- We saw several things on the menu that we want to try!"}
{"text":"Ordered a \"cubano\" and when it arrives it's just a pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce. I even have the picture to prove it. Please change the name so it's not deceiving customers."}
{"text":"Jennifer's Catering is AMAZING.  I was lucky enough to have this fantastic company cater my wedding, and the compliments on the food were endless.    My husband and I first came across Jennifer's Catering when they catered my sister-in-law's wedding, and once my husband proposed to me and we started to delve into the planning process, I knew that I had to have Jennifer's Catering prepare the food for our wedding.  I contacted the company and from that point on was in direct communication with Andrew, who handles planning and the like.  He is so incredibly nice, and even when I kept e-mailing him with all sorts of changes and wrong numbers and made him re-do things over and over again, he always responded with unmitigated kindness that never failed to make me smile.  When my hubby and I went for our tasting, everything was out of this world -- the mac and cheese, especially.  We wanted to go for the look of gourmet comfort food --- pulled pork sliders, miniature meatloaf, bruschetta that was to-die-for and other lovely choices flocked our menu, and with every bite of something new that I tasted, \"wow\" was the word that escaped me.   We had a few guests at our wedding who are vegan or vegetarian, and Jennifer's Catering accommodated our needs with delicious food that was appropriate for those dietary needs.    I cannot say enough about Jennifer's.  They worked within our budget constraints and produced the best, most creative food that everyone enjoyed.  I recommend them with five stars -- Jennifer's Catering is truly as good as it gets."}
{"text":"VERY excited about The Market by Jennifer's. As in, I tried it this past weekend, and oh, I'm already going back today. I was excited to see that the place was packed because I want this market to be around for a long time.  The LOCATION is great.  In the complex with Antique Gatherings, Poor Little Rich Girl and Zipps, Right next to Crudo, and facing 36th Street. They've taken limited exterior space, and managed to make a great outdoor patio (that doesn't face Indian School - yay!).   INSIDE - ohemgee. Exposed ceiling, french-inspired chandeliers, and cafe tables. The devil is in the details, and they nailed it. Even the water beverage bar is on a french industrial table, while the order numbers for your table are made of solid wood with bold-font numbers. It feels provincial, trendy and local at the same time. I like a well-designed space.    The SERVICE was great.  Diners order at the counter and the food comes to you. As soon as we walked in, a server told us the process, gave us menus and told us to make ourselves comfortable at a table while we decided.  This avoids a long line at the counter.  While we sat and looked at the menu, we were served water and asked if we had questions.  (Although this is an order at the counter cafe, we never had to get up to refill our water glasses.  The servers were on top of this for us.)  And we did have a question - which of the MENU items do we try because they all sounded ridiculously good.  Traditional lunch and dinner entrees and \"nosh boards.\" We went for the Molten Fondue Nosh Board because we were on a diet (I kid, I kid.) Fresh fruit, locally-made sausage, bread and pretzel bites on a great wooden board with a small cruet of fondue. It was a prefect light lunch for two.  And it was so good that when we finished the board, I was honestly tempted to drink the few remaining drops of the fondue straight.  (Maybe they should offer this as a cocktail \"molten fondue, neat.\") We didn't have dessert or pastries, but the looked worth the splurge.  Last but not least, the \"GRAB N' GO \"  A fridge of prepared entrees that you can buy and pop in the oven at home. I was excited to see entrees in a range of palates - sophisticated choices for an adult get-together to comfort food for the kiddos. (I hear the mac n' cheese is so addictive you should warn your arteries.)  My only point of contention (every review has one) is that they are closed two days - Mondays and Tuesdays.  Deal breaker?  Nah. I'm hoping they're testing the waters and might compromise on one day for those of us hoping to pop in to grab an entree or two for dinner.   So clearly, I'm a fan. I will probably become a Norm-like regular. Cen Pho / Arcadia was crying for a place like this - casual, easy with exceptional food.  Yay. Yay. Yay."}
{"text":"My husbsnd and I were staying downtown Vegas and just happened to come upon this little Gem.  We were looking for somewhere to eat so we stopped in to get snacks and found they served deli sandwhiches. We ordered two different sandwhich and were very impressed with the quality and the quantity if both.  We have since been back for another go and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly casual atmosphere with delicious food at a good price. Good bar selections - margarita was outstanding. All four of us enjoyed our meals. Staff is very helpful. LOVE that it is not a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Vegetarians of vegan people should not try..I ordered salad which was super boring ..I hate this place..."}
{"text":"Eclectic dishes, everything I tried was good. Very busy place and a little cramped ie small. I arrived a few minutes before my reservation and had to wait 15 minutes  while the table was set up.  There isn't really another restaurant like this so I will be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Yumm!! We got the beef filet and the gnocchi to-go and we were pleasently surprised! The lady behind the counter was wonderful and super friendly. I loved the decor and our food was perfectly cooked and equally  delicious. That chimichurri is to die for! We'll definitely be back, thanks for a great meal and service!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot! Stopped in the other night with my fiancee and mother; they are picky on their food, but they loved everything that came out of the kitchen! The staff was very friendly as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"While it's nice to see a grocery store like this it is not for it to be overpriced and having it offering baguettes aged to be as hard as broom stick."}
{"text":"AWESOME brunch spot. Bottomless mimosas, amazing ambiance (live music, cool chandeliers and lighting, and patio space!) and friendly staff. Also the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"We have never been here before, but it was AMAZING!!!   It is small and quaint, but has a nice atmosphere.  I highly recommend the Chilaquiles for brunch and the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for desert.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"So I was a little hesitant about coming here because I didn't see any great reviews on google and menu prices were high. We get there and it literally took over an hour to get our food. I ordered a bread board and nachos. Bread board was good which is why I gave 2 stars but the nachos...Geeze they should not be called nachos I paid $6 for a tiny bowl of potatoe chips with very gross, COLD cheese (if I could even call it cheese) I have a pic attached so you can see for yourself. I only ate like 2 chips and had my friends try too, they weren't pleased.  My friend ordered wings which tasted like plain chicken and they were suppose to be spicy. Those were also not hot. Another friend ordered steak and eggs medium and got rare. I do give props to the waitress she tried really hard to fix the situation,  but often it took her a while to even get to the table which is why I think our food took so long. would not recommend this place, overpriced and food is not good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile and after Chow Bella mentioned how awesome the brunch is on the weekends, my boyfriend and I stopped by. He had the vegetable omelette, I had the meat quiche and we shared a side of bacon. The food was delicious, especially the bacon. The bacon had this amazing, smoky flavor to it. The quiche tasted fresh and flavorful.  The reason for the three stars is the service. I'm not sure if our server was new, but she didn't seem to know the answer to any of our questions. We asked what was in the vegetable omelette and she kind of hemmed and hawed before asking the chef, then she didn't know what the price of the special bacon was, etc. I had ordered a hot chocolate too, but that didn't come out until halfway through the meal and it was lukewarm. The other server seemed more experienced and I hope to get her next time. The food is delicious, so I'll be back again, but hopefully the newer server gets more training."}
{"text":"my only problem with \"The Market\" is that it is not handicapped accessible. A handicapped person has to wait for someone to come by and open the door. Usually this is not an employee, but someone who notices the problem and cares enough to help. If it were not for this the place would get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed a date night at The Market.  When we walked in, my first impression was that it was small and the tables were super close together, however, my initial trepidation was quickly put to rest when we were greeted by super server Kyle.  She was amazing!  Very knowledgeable and all-around fun.  The place was buzzing on a Saturday night, so I would definitely recommend reservations.  Super secret info - the nosh boards are broken down by meat/cheese/veggie, but they can put something together for you if you want to try some of the various elements and not just opt for a single-stream board.  And - though this may not seem like a big deal - our food was timed perfectly after our appetizer and the food was HOT.  Not heat-lamp-hot-plate hot, but hot food like it was just perfectly prepared and brought to our table.  I thought that was really impressive. I had the salmon, which was lovely and my husband had the gnocchi, which he devoured.  My only recommendation?  Dim the lights a bit once it's dark outside.  it was still fairly bright throughout our meal and a bit of ambiance might have been nice.  Otherwise, perfection.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was sooo disappointed by my experience at The Market by Jennifer. My husband & I had a reservation for 615pm on Wednesday evening and unknown to us they were also sponsoring a wine tasting dinner. We were seated basically communal style, the noise level was ridiculous. I had to ASK for dressing on my green goddess salad which was so dry that I actually choked!!! SKIP The Market by Jennifer my  friends!!!"}
{"text":"It's funny when you find a great place, you don't necessarily want everyone to know about it.  They will become busy and the experience will fade.  However, when you come to a place like Jennifer's, you need to make sure they succeed so you can continue to have wonderful experiences.  This is my 5th visit and I can't say enough good about the place!!!  From the menus, to Tom our server, right down to local ambience!  Keep this place thriving, its amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love the neighborhood feel and location of this restaurant.  Every dish we ordered was outstanding.  Can't wait to try the Grab and Go options!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The service was fantastic and friendly! The food was delicious. They have a great amount of brunch choices available. We went with a large group of people and everyone's meal was so good! Try one if their quiches... better than you could ever imagine. Their chef knows what he's doing!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and courteous.  Food was fantastic.  Salmon perfectly cooked.  Cocktails were delicious."}
{"text":"This was an awesome find. My fiancé and me usually stay at El Cortez when we are in vegas. This place is great place to get coffee and pick up some wine.  The breakfast and lunch buffet is a great option for food on Fremont street with a great price!  We will continue to use this cute market on our several trips a year."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  I will say it was Sunday morning and people are slow to rise in Vegas, but the shelves weren't stocked and nothing was ready in the cases at 10am...just coffee.  Perhaps on busy days, they are more prepared for busy mornings. Although, I would not return."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot! Shout out to our fantastic server Larissa. Very knowledgeable of the menu and helpful to those here for the first time. Food portions are great and yummy."}
{"text":"Good placement down on Fremont. Nice and clean but I was expecting more local stuff or more \"Whole Foods\" type of place. Biggest disappointment was they don't have Stumptown coffee anymore, just Pete's coffee now. Meh."}
{"text":"Great find! Had dinner here last night and the atmosphere was great, the food was good, and the service was also great!  Between 4 of us, we had the pork chop, Nicosia salad, salmon, and carbonara. Started with a yummy burrata app and ended with the cookies and milk and the crepe brûlée. Yum!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come I here. Been eyeing this place since it started being built out. Although we came here for desert and coffee only, their dinner menu looked liked it has some delicious meals. The desert here was top notch. We had an Apple bourbon stack and a brown butter brownie chocolate chip cookie. Some of the best and more unique deserts I've ever had. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back. The waitress was telling us about their happy hour and how you can see the sunset from the patio tables. We plan on coming back for happy hour and dinner to see the sunset. I love discovering new local restaurants like this. Come by, check this place out, treat yourself to some good food, support local business, and make sure to tell your friends :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had a great experience.   Parking is easy, right on the corner next to Crudo. I was quickly greeted by a very friendly server who took me over to the cooler to pick out my beer of choice. Ended up having a nice hefeweizen from Temecula, CA.  My friend and I decided to split the cheese board, $14. They were out of the brie that comes with it, so they upped the size of the other cheese portions. The goat Humbolt Fog was my favorite. The board comes with dried fruit (similar to the kind you find in trail mix), spiced almonds (loved these) and a very interesting apricot compote (it actually tasted like sausage, but i think i liked it.)  The atmosphere is cool and comfortable. It looks like they have some great grab-and-go options as well.  I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu, but not when I'm looking for a meal under $12..."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwich.  Only wish they had toasted the English muffin.  But regardless would get it again.  Yum.   And their latte was great as well.  Tons of options and hoodies to try."}
{"text":"Great little market with all the essentials and some more peculiar items as well. I like the bulk grains and treats near the front. They had fantastic water melons for just $1.50 a lb. but the cheese section was a little limited and some of the deli items didn't look all that fresh. I will definitely be back to peruse some more."}
{"text":"Service has gotten a little better. I still come here for \"The Buisness\" salad and Tree of Life.  Now selling VioLife cheeses that were only available at the Joe Max and Mad Coffee locations."}
{"text":"Delicious food, very nice, friendly service. And honestly the price of food items is reasonable. Oh and do yourself a favor and order a side of bacon jam!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about the experience here is tops. Happened across it while on my way to a different place, and am thrilled with my decision. The food, wow. I had an omelette. The menu liats three different kind, a pepper, a pok and a cheese. I thought all three  sounded good, so they made a combo and omg it must be one of the best omelets I've ever had!   The details of the whole place have been well thought out. From the size of the coffee cup to the music to even a nice little shelf next the to toilet in the bathroom (perfectly clean bathroom, btw)  I'd make this my go to diner if I lived anywhere even remotely close!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after hearing good reviews.  This is in my neighborhood.  Very cute inside, and had hoped it was good.  They had a Huge sign advertising Bloody Mary's.  My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and the food came before the drink.  The waitress then proceeded to tell us that she had to call the owner to figure out how to make the drink.  It was loaded around the rim with too much celery salt.  It was not that good.  My friend had the huevos Rancheros, it was covered what appeared to be canned enchilada sauce and it was just ok.  I had an omelet that was very boring.  They should not even serve breakfast in there.  I did not even eat a huge part of mine and I told the waitress how disappointed I was.  I think they should have adjusted our bill.  It would be a good place to go and drink wine, they don't have to make that.  But I would not order a cocktail or any other food there.  I probably will not be back.  It is too bad, they had a great decor and I love all the little places popping up in the neighborhood.  They need to train their staff to make a Blood Mary for heavens sake or remove it from the menu."}
{"text":"\"Hey hey hey, smoke weed everyday.\" These employees need mandatory espresso shots before they hit the floor. Takes light years to get checked out here. Good spot but goddamn the wait is brutal."}
{"text":"Love the Yelp special.  A cup of posele, loaded with pork in a light green chile broth, topped with fresh red onion, radish, and cabbage with baked chips on the side.  Fish tacos were crispy nuggets of joy.  Flavorful fish, hot and flaky, topped with cabbage, fresh avocado sliced, pico and light spicy ajoili.  Gnocchi was light clouds of ricotta topped with shredded pork, spinach and parmesian.  Dinner was completed with a great Napa cab sold by the glass at a reasonable price.  Wonderful meal$"}
{"text":"This was a cute market I'd have to say. It's located on Fremont street (don't worry though, they have an adjacent parking lot). They have just about everything you can find in a Whole Foods store. They've got outdoor seating and a buffet style stand with dishes and salad which is $7.99 per pound. I didn't get to get myself food but they sure smelled and looked very tasty! You can eat it indoor or outdoor, whichever you prefer and I'm a fan of that! They've got fruits, a frozen isle, snacks, and drinks, and so much more!  I'm into the cleanliness of their store inside and out. The interior and exterior decor was very eye-catching and one of my favorite aspects. Another favorite of mine is how fresh their produce looked especially their fruits! Anyway, I love most places in dtlv so I'm a huge fan of The Market! I would come here anytime I'm in downtown Las Vegas thirsting for some water or snacking.   I do definitely recommend you to check it out as well if you're in the area because you've got nothing to lose, support this local business!"}
{"text":"The market by Jennifer. My first time here, and I get to tour the kitchen with the GM. So clean. I ordered the wedge salad to start, it's a Iceberg wedge, point Reyes blue cheese, bacon. Hard to go wrong with this salad. I also ordered the rock shrimp poboy. So good. The shrimp were cooked to about medium rare. A chewy, hard crumbly bread was the rock that held all the goodies inside and gave the sandwich more body. What was just awesome was the pickled and roasted pig trotter. Freaking awesome. It came with a light green salad with a citrus vin. So tender, juicy and fattening. But well worth it. You can also grab cold food to go pre made. Some you can heat up yourself. I went the other way and took home an awesome imperial stout. (yes, they have beer and wine to go!) I can't wait to take my girlfriend in to try the meat and cheese boards and have a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Loved this place,  I had the seared yellowfin salad, and it was amazing.  It's pricey but worth it .  I would say to order it raw since I got it medium and it was cooked all of the say through, with no pink.  It was still amazing, even over cooked."}
{"text":"I've never written a yelp review before, mainly because I've never really been compelled to. Either the place is great and everyone knows it, or it wasn't that good. Let me tell you though, people need to know about The Market By Jennifer's. I'm sitting on the patio enjoying one of the better views of an AZ sunset I've ever seen, while sipping on delicious wine that is half off (during happy hour only of course), and chowing down on this amazing chips and dip plate (complimentary during HH!!). Karlene, our waitress, was extremely knowledgable and attentive. How is this place not packed?! Truly a hidden Arcadia gem. If you don't know, now you know. Get here."}
{"text":"We need more of these markets in Las Vegas!  Such a wonderful neighborhood addition which just recently opened in October!  Here you can find traditional groceries locally sourced as well as produce also sourced by local farmers but without really jacking up the prices.  Also delicious coffee which on this trip I got to sample. The expresso machine was new  to them so there were some small technicalities, but still enjoyed a great tasting late.   They offer great grab and go food options like their hot food and cold salad bar, gourmet handmade sandwiches, a full size deli, craft beer and wine, pastries and so much more sure to cater and tantalize even the most finickiest eater!   I can easily see this market becoming a regular stop for me so luckily they are open Sunday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Friday and Saturday, 7 a.m. to midnight!"}
{"text":"Local version of Whole Foods, with an eye-catching exterior mural and outdoor seating. Inside offers a limited handful of grocery store staples, but their focus is on take-and-eat food and beverage, including some alcoholic options.  Order at the counter from a menu of sandwiches and sides for breakfast and lunch, grab a juice from a refrigerated case or a coffee from the barista, and visit the cafeteria-style hot foods section to take your lunch or dinner home for later!  Friendly service, clean and organized space. Especially love the tables and chairs outside- bonus points for an adjacent parking lot!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. They had a special menu for restaurant week. The risotto was creamy, savory, and well balanced. The squid was light and fresh partnered with a lemon aioli. The service was good. The chef checked every dish before it left the kitchen... A nice commitment to quality. I give the food 5 stars out of respect for a job well done.   The downsides... The dining area was cramped and hot inside. Sitting through dinner was loud and uncomfortable... For this I had to drop a star.   I will definitely be back when the weather cools off and we can eat outside... Or sooner if they can turn on the air conditioner."}
{"text":"First time patrons,  Sat afternoon,  quaint place,  fun and fresh decor. Good service.  A bit confusing for a newbie,  seeing that there was no direction as to if you are to wait to be seated, seat yourself or order at the counter.  Great presentation of the meat nosh board and herb fries accompanied by iced coffee(that had no real strength to it) and was surprised that a restaurant like this didn't serve a simple syrup with the coffee, but packets of all types of sugar. Meat nosh board was tasty,  Good variety, could use a bit more cheese and bread for all of the meat they give you,  And the peach chutney was oishii(delicious)! Try, it won't hurt."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the fly one day to get to go dinners. Revelation!  The food was so delicious we decided to come back for brunch. It's a menu brunch rather than a buffet.  The food is so well prepared and the ingredients chosen with such care.  The staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable.  They have a full bar as well as a good wine and beer selection.  We went back to try the dinner. I ordered risotto, which was as good as it gets.  My companion ordered the salmon.  Just delicious.  They have a nice selection of desserts. We went with the Bananas Foster bread pudding. Many, many yums.  I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Great food - their LGBTQ sandwich, half chicken entree and their smoothies are to die for."}
{"text":"Went with friends and loved the whole experience. Service was impeccable. The food was fantastic, and the wine pairings were perfect. The restaurant faces 36th Street vs. Indian School, so you'd have to know it's there... It's not a place you'd stumble upon. Great little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Unique, friendly little place with delicious food and great take-home meals as well. Service is exceptional and most everyone will find something they love here. Saturday nights are even better with live music from Daylon Greer of Elvis Before Noon.  The nosh boards and dessert are must-try items."}
{"text":"I really hope this place catches on..and yet I like the smaller intimate crowd but mostly I LOVE the food.  I had fish tacos..LOVED them..and I think I have eaten fish tacos in almost every western state.  husband had the ricotta gnocchi and he would have licked the bowl had I let him.  we will return.  Glad we had a Groupon or living social..hope she does more of those. James was our waiter..lots of fun."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! All you can drink mimosas for $15! Amazing meals all around! I get their breakfast sandwich frequently because of the amazing brioche bun and new options daily! My husband and his friend were also LOVING their hot sauces! If you want something with flavor and heat, their yellow habanero hot sauce is the one!  Thanks for feeding us well, Jennifer!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great staff. Karleen is one of the employees and she always recommends the best items on the menu to eat. We also met Jennifer for the first time and she made the experience even better, very happy and made us enjoy our meal even more. S'mores board is a must try for desert."}
{"text":"We came in for our year anniversary to celebrate! Our waiter Jaycen was fantastic!  Great personality too and very sweet! Their food was so delicious and there cocktails too! We will definitely be coming in again for more visits!"}
{"text":"If you really are willing to have the delicious dinner with all cool and friendly environment then must visit \"The Market\" once.   The hotel is offering you delicious yummy food along with the fresh desserts, you might have never tasted before. The foods and services might seem to be expensive but quality cannot be ignored.   They are offering you clean and tidy restroom, bathrooms and bar area that will surely make you wow!   The best about them that they really care their customers and never make them disappointed in terms of their service."}
{"text":"When I rate a restaurant, I think about what could be improved. Last night at the Market, not much. The service was great, and the food wonderful. Went with three colleagues from work after tromping around the Navajo Reservation and we were pretty dusty. The shrimp and grits appetizer was a little uninspired but quite good. I had the meat trio which was very very good but sausage was a shade less than excellent. But the chicken and beef members of the plate were terrific, the potato mash and green beans too. One other guy had the gnocchi, and the fourth had the salmon. Absolutely clean plates and happy tummies all around. Beer and wine selection top class. Too full to order dessert. Don't let the location deter you, just go and enjoy- you won't be disappointed. For me, a five star rating doesn't come easily, and this place almost made it."}
{"text":"We just moved to downtown Vegas and were thrilled that the Market's opening would beautifully coordinate with our arrival.  That enthusiasm didn't last long.  1) the selection is extremely limited. Very few fresh veggies and nothing organic.  No dark roast coffee.  We wanted to support local and figured it would take a little time for the Market to get adjusted to the locals and our needs.  So we tried again, but then the real kicker, 2) the service is terrible!  My husband, (who is 48 with a full head of mostly gray hair), went in to buy beer yesterday.  They carded him which I find surprising, but then they would not accept his CT drivers license that the the NV DMV punched because his new NV license is scheduled to arrive within 5-7 days.  Really?!?"}
{"text":"Finally! - A grocery store in downtown Las Vegas!  I don't live down there but I know lots of people who do and I'm sure they are super happy about not having to take the highway to the grocery anymore.    The Market is small but adequate for anyone living downtown.  They carry mostly organic items, fresh produce, and a fairly small frozen section (which is probably better anyway).  The best part is the deli with made or order sandwiches, a buffet with breakfast in the morning & lunch type food in the afternoons.  They also have a dessert case - usually cheesecake, cupcakes... the normal stuff but they look delicious!     I noticed that the prices were a bit high ($5.49 for a small box of Ritz crackers.. say whaaattt??) but I suppose it evens out when you factor in the gas you are saving not driving to the grocery store.  Overall, it's a cute little store with everything the downtowners need!"}
{"text":"Great food, and good staff. The transients bothering you outside was not as enjoyable but the food made up. We got the LGBT with turkey and avocado, amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Didn't even get the chance to look at the menu. Came in on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm. Stood at the door for few minutes, no acknowledgement. Mind you, the place wasn't busy but wait staff looked like they were dragging..I thought we could just seat ourselves since it looked like they didn't have a hostess..finally i grab the attention of someone working there. Asked if we could sit anywhere to which he replied \"no\" and then gave us multiple options on where to sit. He said he'd bring us menus but never did. Waited for 10mins then finally my husband asks someone if they could bring us menus. A party came in after us but they got the attention first, menus, water, etc... So we decided to walk out. One of their staff simply said \"later\"...no apologies or anything.   I guess they feel like they do not need to provide customer service to everyone..sadly we won't be back and advise the staff that they need to be consistent on how they handle their customers."}
{"text":"We dined here for Valentine's Day. It was great but a few things stuck out. My boyfriend had called ahead to make sure they had their regular menu too- which they did but they failed to mention it.  The maitre de also placed us next to another couple when we came in and the place was far from empty- we asked to move tables and lucky we did because it never filled up.  Otherwise, the food was amazing and our server was great. We really enjoyed the wine pairing with each course. I think we would try it again."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend & I grab a quick lunch while he's at work we love coming here to the cafe located inside. They have the best sandwiches ever! Seriously, the turkey on wheat with the avocado & sprouts is heaven. It's very simple & fast. Always clean. Always nice. I don't have anything bad to say... The market is basically a local market of whole foods, only better."}
{"text":"My 6 friends and I had reservations yesterday morning when they opened at 11.  We are all older and were sat at the tall table right next to the counter, the chairs were HORRIBLY uncomfortable, made of medal with a really tiny little seat, like for a 5 year old, we all kept sliding off of them because they had such a high gloss on them.  I brought it to several peoples attention and asked to be moved and was told that the other 6+ tables were all reserved, mind you we had reservations too.  The food looked like it would be really good and I guess if it had been hot it would've been but my over easy eggs were hard, the enchiladas underneath were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted.  The icing on the cake was the noise, we had a hard time hearing each other at the long, high table and then they brought in loud, live music, Oh Boy, won't be my next choice of places to go.  The flowers on our table were completely dead in cloudy water, obviously needed to be replaced yesterday.  When the waitress brought our bills, gratuity was already included, she asked me if I needed change on my $20 bill, I was like a yeah I do, I didn't get $7 service here.  Just saying, if I ever went back, it definitely wouldn't be on a Sunday morning and I would refuse to sit at that tall table.  The only good thing I can say about this place is had my eggs been cooked properly, they would've been amazing, I don't know where they get their eggs from but the yoke was amazing, what part of it that was still soft."}
{"text":"My wife and I went a couple of Wednesday's ago and had the vegetable board, gnocci, and flourless chocolate cake. The food was all pretty good, however, it was a little tight the way the tables were arranged and a bit loud off on and on from a wine group that they do in the middle of the week but otherwise great atmosphere. Also, the chocolate cake was dense, very chocolaty and really good."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. If you are staying downtown and looking for a place for lunch definitely check them out."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a better review. I've been waiting for a place like this to open and was pumped to see the market finally open last week. I understand that it's new but still they need to get themselves together. I ordered a sandwich, a flavorless chicken sandwich last week which came on a stale roll. I chocked it up to an opening week mistake. Today I ordered a veggie sandwich, paid for it and then was told their was no eggplant and they could substitute something. I said that would be fine so long as it was veggies. I walked over to the prepared food section and it looked like they had other roasted veggie options. He came back a minute later and told me they were actually out of all the ingredients for the sandwich. How can you be out of all the ingredients for one of your only vegetarian options? I asked if he could just make a sandwich with other veggies and he asked if I could pick  something else on the menu of 6 sandwiches.  I ended up with an ok but overpriced grilled cheese. He didn't offer compensation for clearly an issue that was his fault. Like i said, I want to like this place since right near my office. I'll try back in a few weeks"}
{"text":"This is the only market really downtown. They have a bit of fruit. A little over priced. You definatly pay for the convenience. Fresh juice machine is a plus. Bagged snack selection has been in decline for a while.  The cafe is really nice. House made food is great. Wonderful selection. Especially the vegan desserts. Coffee is petes wicked , very good. Barista service is always awesome. Especially from the woman with longer hair works morning, redish hair.   Why 3 stars?  There always seems to be issues with a few things. Its been to frequent for to long not to mention. The creamer. Few times no creamer for sale in grocery. No big deal. Ill buy a coffee. Baristas are always nice. Several times now , no creamer for sale and no creamer on barista side. ???? Charged for flavored pump? An oversight but c'mon principal.  I hardly visit anymore because of this. Its happened last few visits. This recent visit , yup no creamer. What I found in its place promted the review. CREAMER FROM CHRISTMAS ON THE SHELF.  The dairy bin for creamer empty one vist and then next visit the Christmas flavores 6 MONTHS EXPIRED pop up. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"What started out as a nice little organic market has become a glorified convenience store with no convenience.  Hit the old school down at about 4th and Fremont.  Way friendlier and way cheaper and way better."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to The MARKET by Jennifer during our Arizona Valentine's Day trip. The prix Fixe menu with wine pairing was an exceptional and well thought out option that added to our experience. The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive, and made our visit something that aids in growing our relationship. The MARKET was an unforgettable highlight that punctuated the trip."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great and they have a good selection of items for lunch/brunch (including bottomless mimosas for $15).  We were here on a Saturday around noon and although the restaurant was not full, the service was a little slow.  The food is tasty, but a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"It is convenient that there is a grocery store in walking distance of Fremont St. I am getting tired of casino food. But, a bunch of the shelves are empty. There is like, no food. What is going on with this place?"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood bistro with real community spirit. They approached me about doing a food bank find raiser and the nopales frites they created for the event were so popular they continued to keep them as an ongoing fundraiser.  We need more great places like this!  Be sure to try the Superior-tini (jalapeño laced, made with legally harvested Superior prickly pears) while you're there!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - we had the most delicious meal here over the weekend! I LOVE that their ingredients are locally sourced and organic. You can absolutely tell in the quality and flavor of their dishes.   We ordered so many items! I started with their Yelp check-in offer {duh!} for a free cup of pozole. It was good! Not the best that i've ever had, was lacking some flavor, so I probably wouldn't order it again but it was free - so no complaints! As a table, we split the green goddess salad and dungeness crab mac - holy heaven, they were both incredible! For my entree, I got the steak that came with fennel potatoes and fresh roasted veggies. The steak was SO tender and perfectly cooked. I am obsessed with fennel so the potatoes were a dream. I was in heaven!   We didn't save room for dessert but i'm sure those are fab as well. I want to come back here for lunch to see what that is like too! We'll absolutely be back soon! Thanks for an incredible meal!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most bland food ever. Service was horrible. I was driving thru VA and stopped by. Very unfriendly staff ."}
{"text":"Great soups and wine--a quick walk from home and they are dog friendly on the patio!!! Their wine tasting/pairing events are exceptional! I have attended two and both were wonderful!  They have live music on Sunday's but are closed Monday's! Great neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"If you like ambience and creativity this place is for you. They also cater. Awesome brunch menu."}
{"text":"Have you ever tried to do an online search for restaurants where a woman is the majority owner?  Let me tell you something, it is TOUGH!  Don't get me wrong, I've dined at a number of restaurants here in the valley owned by women.  Silvana Esparza's Barrio Cafe, Carla Logan's Carly's Bistro, Tonya Saidi's Pie Hole, and the Sizemore sisters' Treehouse Bakery just to name a few.  But what I thought would be a quick and easy search for other majority women owned restaurants in the valley turned into a near frantic hours long Googlefest.  Making the process even more frustrating was seeing that many restaurants with female monikers were in fact owned by men.  Then I came upon The Market.  A restaurant I'd vaguely heard about, but had never visited before.    So on International Women's Day, I was off to visit this Arcadia area spot owned by Jennifer Russo-Fitzgerald.  Jennifer had run her own catering operation for the better part of two decades, before setting up shop here in the Gaslight Square area on the southeast corner of 36th Street and Indian School.  The Square is already a haven for foodies with restaurants like Crudo, Nook Kitchen, and Beckett's Table nearby.  The Market itself fits in quite nicely, with a space that is both aesthetically appealing and welcoming.  The interior has seating for about 60 including bar seating, high chairs and regular sit down tables.  The ceiling is adorned with chandeliers and the walls are a mix of local artwork and chalkboards full of information about the restaurant and Jennifer's still operational catering business.  The exterior has seating for about 20-30 more including a drop down high chair seating area for groups.  I came just before 5pm while things were still pretty quiet so I got a seat no problem.  First thing I did was show my Yelp Check-In which gets you a free cup of their housemade Posole Verde.  First off, this wasn't a cup.  It was a full bowl of pork, cabbage, hominy, radish, onion, cilantro, lime, and poblano peppers.  The spice level wasn't overwhelming, but certainly enough to wake up your palette and clear your nasal passages.  Great broth and tender pork.  To wash some of it down, I got one of their cocktails.  The Arcadia Sunset.  Tequila, aperol, lemon and something called strawberry peppercorn shrub.  The drink was okay, but kinda fell flat for me.  It's possible I was more focused on cooling off my tongue after that posole.  For my main entree, I was stuck between three dishes.  Before I could even utter my options, my waiter Taylor told me to get the Carbonara (which did happen to be one of my three dishes of choice).  Spaghetti with pancetta, parmigiana reggiano cheese, peas, corn, chopped tomato, cracker pepper, lemon, parsley, and a poached egg.  Wow, this hit all the right notes.  Admittedly just stirring the poached egg into the pasta was a fun distraction, but surprisingly sweet notes on the pancetta and the peas were really what set this apart for me.  Super dish and great noodles.  For dessert, I opted for the Bananas Foster Nutella Bread Pudding.  Just the title alone made me salivate.  It also doesn't hurt they're using brioche as the bread of choice.  The flower-like presentation is certainly pretty.  The mix of nutella and caramel flavors made it even prettier.  Perfect for sharing, though I had no trouble on my own.  Seriously, every bread pudding should use brioche.  Total cost for the cocktail, entree, dessert, tax and tip (sans the free posole) came to about $50.  Yeah, its not a cheap place to eat unless you're here just grazing during happy hour.  Most of the main dinner entrees here average about $20 each and the apps are around $10-$15 each so this wouldn't be an everyday stop for most.  That said, Jennifer Russo-Fitzgerald takes great pains to source all of her stuff locally which does at least partially explain the price point.  Another cheaper option is their weekend brunch which The Market is probably most known for, and when most of their main menu runs between $10-15.  All things considered, I was impressed by the creativity, the fresh flavors, the service, and ambiance.  And as I mentioned Jennifer still runs her catering operation for your corporate and social event needs.  Great dinner to cap off Women's Day and further proof that women can be successful and innovative entrepreneurs just as men can.  Let's hope the valley sees even more women owned establishments like this one in the years to come."}
{"text":"Like others, I want to like The Market.  I'm a regular in Downtown Las Vegas and truly believe that it's a 'food desert' - devoid of fresh, healthy, affordable options and filled with an array of low quality $10 prime rib specials, happy hours and deep fried Hostess treats.  The Market has the opportunity to be this community's culinary salvation, but management is falling short of delivering on that promise.  The vast majority of the store is filled with heavily processed 'health foods', energy drinks and packaged liquor.  The limited amount of produce that does exist is old, mealy or otherwise unappealing.  To the management of this little parcel of prospective gold -  Do you know that there's still a chance for you?  'Cause there's a spark in you. You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine.  Just own the night like the 4th of July. 'Cause, baby, you're a firework.  Make em go ah, ah, ah."}
{"text":"had dinner here Saturday night with family. The food was good staff is very sweet. The bread was extremely fresh, loved my risotto with shrimp. too full to have dessert though."}
{"text":"The people, the food, the drinks and just the entire vibe of this place is amazing! Went for a tasting and got WAY more than expected. Everyone was very friendly and hospitable. Ana is one of the supervisors and she made sure we were taken care of and fully satisfied. She's amazing! Thanks to the awesome manager David for everything"}
{"text":"The Market has been absolutely PHENOMENAL since The Bronze Cafe's owner took it over. The Market's Brunch was sooo good that we had to return to try the dinner menu... which was just as amazing! All of the entrees were awesome! Fantastic quality for the price and convenience! I'll definitely be back!   I ordered their off-the-menu grilled steak with a side of basmati rice and mashed sweet potatoes. It was paired with grilled peppers and tomato. The mashed sweet potatoes were SO buttery and delicious!  My friend ordered the Peruvian Chicken with a side of Basmati Brown Rice, which was also paired with grilled peppers and tomato.  She liked it so much that she didn't let me have a bite! haha  Another one of my friends ordered the Skewed Grill Shrimp, Drizzled with Chimichurri Sauce, with Basmati Brown Rice and Grilled Tomatoes and Peppers.  HE at least let me have a bite.  I thought I was delicious!  The shrimp skewered were grilled to perfection!  Finally, my last friend ordered the Vegetable Falafel with Vegan Szechian Sauce, paired with Cranberry & Almond Quinoa.  I have to admit this was my least favorite of all the dishes, but it was still delicious!    We ordered a pitcher of The Market's 100% Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice.  It was soooo refreshing and delicious!  The Market literally has a machine where they just put the pure oranges within to make the orange juice.  You can certainly taste the difference compared to the commercial products.    I strongly recommend eating at this location now that David Mozes' The Bronze Café has overtaken the joint.  You won't be disappointed with anything you order. :) The staff is also very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best bacon sandwich i have ever had and their natural deserts are spectacular, i recommend the strawberry cookie and the banna bread."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for a wedding and my friends and I popped in here out of the blue.  We were extremely delighted by the delicious food, the incredible customer service, warm atmosphere and top notch management.  We felt as if somehow they knew in advance we were in town for a family wedding it was so amazing how friendly and warm everyone was!  5/5 only because 5 stars is the limit.  Thanks again Jeff!"}
{"text":"I work right down the street from The Market and often have little down time in-between tanning clients to eat, so I love the convenience of stopping by The Market to pick up a delicious, gourmet meal from their \"Grab N Go\" section that offers REAL, quality meals that'll nourish and energize me for the remainder of my day. You won't find long lines here or in their parking lot. Parking is a cinch (no valet), which allows me to literally walk in and out in 5 minutes. It's one of the best attributes of The Market that I can greatly appreciate.  A hungry girl is no pretty sight so time is of value when it comes to feasting.  I'm also here every Sunday stocking up on my Evolution Juices for the week because The Market sells them at $4! That's the best price I've seen so far in the Valley, plus the girls and Richard always have a warm smile to share every time I walk in.   The restaurant has an open air feel to it, great packaging for spices and delicious pastries. I've only had one opportunity to sit down and dine, but I'd love to explore their menu more."}
{"text":"I am not sure even how to give this amazing and beautiful neighborhood spot  the words it is due.   The service, top notch, we had the kindest server who's only mission was to provide a great Sunday morning brunch experience.  The food, made fresh to order with local and organic ingredients when possible.   The atmosphere, sweet. Great music, not crowded, and unbelievable attention to detail. From the tags on the wine and beer bottles for sale in the market to the candy cane striped straws and the soft napkins mindfully wrapped with a tiny twine bow.   They have a music and event schedule with outside seating. The location is off to the corner so drive around the plaza building if you cannot find it at first.  I will be back and look forward to another amazing experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"My 8 year old daughter and I came here around 6pm on a Sat night for dinner. There were only 2 tables sat but it was a fairly nice crowd (6 tables...the place isn't that big) by the time we finished around 7:30pm.   FOOD: We started with a cup of posole which was much better after I asked for a side of lime. I ordered the salmon w/ mashed parsnips. It was good...the parsnips were a little too sweet for me as I typically like savory but it was tasty, nonetheless. My daughter loved the mushrooms and I did too! My daughter had the shrimp and grits which weren't your typical shrimp-n-grits like what you get on NOLA. It was poached shrimp which is fine but the dish lacked favor. I had to ask for salt, pepper and hot sauce to help it out. They serve Homeboy's hot sauce and the Verde went well with it. They should replace the green sauce that come drizzled on it with something more flavorful like that Verde sauce. The Malbec I had was delish! We skipped dessert.   SERVICE: Our server (male) was great but there was a blonde female server (asked her for limes) who was indifferent...not nasty but not friendly either.    SUMMARY: The food was good but needed some extra seasoning/flavor. However, it's a nice, low key, quaint yet kinda trendy spot in the neighborhood with seemingly healthy and fresh food so I will be back. Only 3-stars because for a tab of $57 (before tip), I shouldn't have to add to the food to make it more flavorful."}
{"text":"I went In to The Market all like: man, they're next to Crudo? They better be cooking with The Force or something.   CUT TO: Munchkin & I prego-style waddle to my car; thought-bubbles above my head cue the reader to a stream of grawlix interspersed with litany.   My Munchkin: Crudo, you need to get yo sh!t togetha!  The Market is just serious, honest, effectual, comforting & unapologetically humble (but better than your nana made) goodness."}
{"text":"Loved our breakfast! One mimosa is all I can do. Had pulled pork and chiles omelet with white cheese, completely delish and gluten free! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The Gaslight Square is on fire and this is another bright option to this strip mall. Why am I so hooked to The Market? They didn't copycat any typical new restaurants. All of their interiors are fastidious and tasteful (not just thrown up yesterday) and they definitely have the cafe vibe. I'm excited about the cheeseboard and charcuterie options plus happy hour. Baked goods are very yummy and quiche was gorgeous.    Staff were extremely professional - even making sure that tidying up (sweeping) wasn't a bother to me.  Thanks for the great option in our neighborhood! Looking forward to kicking back on your patio this spring.   Folks, they also have ample parking... A commodity in Arcadia."}
{"text":"A fantastic add to the AZ dining scene!  We stopped in today for wine/champagne and a cheese and charcuterie board.  The service was fantastic - our server had a great personality and made the experience an even better one.  The space is shabby chic and just fantastic with all of the doors/windows open on a beautiful afternoon.  We'll definitely be back to try more food and to be our \"go to\" place for wine and cheese in the Valley."}
{"text":"I usually pop in here late at night if I'm around container park or downtown doing a shoot of leaving a concert. The staff is friendly and nice. I like the little market setup, I usually grab a snack and a drink and hit up the little cafe area to review my photos and such. It's a nice quiet spot without crack heads, pan handlers or the rest of the swamp donkeys i encounter when shooting. I know it's not a huge market like smith's or albertsons but it's good to stop in for a little something while you are downtown."}
{"text":"This place is great! We went on a Sunday morning. I had the enchiladas. The sauce was perfection with just the right amount of heat and smokiness. The egg on top was also perfectly cooked. I was really impressed and can't wait to go again. They are heavy on local sourcing which is just icing on the cake for me."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday morning for brunch/breakfast.  Their Bloody Mary board is excellent!  You can create your beverage to your liking.  I love that!  Great idea.  I had the meat quiche and it was delicious and the service was great for us, very prompt.  I like the grab-n-go options as well as some of the marketplace items like quail eggs, very cool.  I will definitely be going back since it's right in our hood as well."}
{"text":"I give \"The Market\" an \"E\" for Effort.  They needed a business like this badly in this part of Las Vegas.  The next closest place to find even decent groceries is miles away.  I mean decent, meaning not a .99 only store.  The produce looked fresh and of good quality.  They did not have a huge stock but all the essentials needed to make a fresh meal if necessary.  You cannot over order in this type of business otherwise everything will go in the trash.  I also noticed a lot of great snack foods and even a small bulk foods section.     The Market is very well organized and clean.  I really enjoyed the beverage selection especially the craft beer.  I must come down and try a sixer or two of some of these.  The \"Green Flash IPA\" looks delicious and a few other caught my eye.  When we were there over the weekend they were doing some wine sampling with a very good mix of variety's of California wines.  Very nice.    Next time we are here I think we will order some food from the counter.  They offer sandwiches made to order and \"grab n go\" items that are cooked but ready to heat at home for a quick meal.  They Whole foods style self serve buffet line is great in theory for cold items.  When you prepare hot foods it is really important to keep these items fresh.  The chef needs to work on his execution on some of these because onion rings after 3 hours, IDK! I do not care how drunk you area at night but that cannot be good.  I would experiment with this section to see what will hold the best under these warming equipment conditions.  The soup they offer was a Broccoli and Cheddar and was delicious.  Another recommendation is don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach otherwise you end up paying for a $15-20 pile of food you won't be able to eat.    Outdoor and Indoor seating is available for you to enjoy your purchase.  I like the outdoor area for people watching. They also have available for use while here IPADS while you eat your food. Just ask.  If your in the DTLV neighborhood stop by \"The Market for some goodies weather it a sandwich or brew support these local businesses.  Our city needs them to succeed."}
{"text":"I am writing to sing the praises of the Niçoise salad.  The seared tuna on it was flawlessly prepared, the haricot verts were perfectly al dente and I loved the touch of roasted tomatoes. And at $13 which may seem a little steep, it was a lot of food---I didn't finish it.  The people that worked there were very friendly.   It's a little hard to find, being at the back of the shopping center next to Crudo."}
{"text":"I'm considering moving to Vegas just so I can eat here on a regular basis. The Complicated Order is so incredible that I came back the next day and ate it again for breakfast. The pineapple mint chia drink is great as well. The staff is some of the kindest people I've met and they are so attentive. Please move to LA so I can come here 3x a week."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to try this for awhile. Our server was nice and location was good as well. The risotto was delicious. The pork tenderloin was just ok. We ordered the sundae and received it missing the necessary parts to warrant a $9 dessert- no macerated berries and no whip cream. Made the server aware and surprisingly nothing was done. Something minor but leaves a bad finish."}
{"text":"Thank Goddess for this place!  It' s New Year's Day and every \"traditional\" eatery has insane lines,so we walked.  Right across the street from the El Cortez, near Container Park is this amazing gem . Excellent, fresh food, perfectly prepared, with quite generous portions, for a reasonable price. The employees feel like friends already. I am certainly coming back. Uber YUM !!!"}
{"text":"Five gold stars for this place. Healthy eating. Everything is fresh. Great bottomless Mimosas and a great cup of coffee. Too many items on the menu to choose from. Calling all Vegans-- there's an abundance to choose from. Richard, the General Mgr. is very accommodating.  Love the old classic black-and-white movies on a Sunday morning.e."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of my friend's dentist, who happened to be the father of the owner. My friend and I ended up sharing the Cuban sandwich And also sharing their Daily Special of Posole, which is a pork based soup with hominy. These paired perfectly. The sandwich contained a hefty size of marinated grilled pork on nice slightly toasted bun. The restaurant also promotes locally sourced foods like Danzeisen Dairy. The general manager also spoke to us about the various items you can buy at the market such as fresh chicken and yes even duck eggs! He also talked about these native american beans they carry that contain a whopping 150% of your daily iron in a single 1/4 cup serving. I'll definitely be swinging by this place again for their food and the products they carry."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5*, I will go back maybe it is 4* (I'm stingy with the star rating).  Good neighborhood spot for brunch, especially of our looking for laid back and not the bottomless drink and loud party spot.  well seasoned and executed dishes.  Their outdoor seating is well thought out, shaded and was pleasant for a warm June morning. I will have to go back and check out their dinner service.  Our server was great, seemed like someone who would really take care of the regulars and great service overall.  I wanted the coffee to be a little better."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch based on previous reviews and am glad I did. Had the wedge salad and chicken...cannot express how delicious and fresh the food was. Certainly wish we had a \"go to\" spot like this is N Scottsdale. I am a big fan of Becket's Table but would be just as happy eating here and this place is certainly a little more reasonable. Not only was the food awesome but the server took the time to explain their process in the kitchen which I find not only a wonderful personal touch but as a foodie enjoy learning new ways to prepare food. Do yourself a favor and stop in, you will not regret this truly pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"Tried this for place for the first time this weekend, and had a great experience.  It's a small, casual place with a modern, mildly upscale menu (priced quite reasonably).    There were four of us, and we sampled food and drink pretty broadly.  Wine, beer, and a couple cocktails... All solid.    For starters, we tried a couple of the boards - cheese-sausage and cheese.   The cheese board was essentially what one might expect.  Sample of cheeses, apples, nuts, and olive tapenade.  The sausage-cheese board was essentially a sliced brat, cheese fondue, and some very yummy pickled vegetables.  Overall, these were just ok.  For entrees, my wife got the gniocchi and I ordered risotto.  F---. me.  Both were ridiculously good... Though I have to admit she made the better choice.  The gniocchi had perfect texture and was served in a delicious tomato based sauce with wilted greens (spinach?) and this killer roasted pork.   The risotto was was no slouch.  Al dente with duck confit, mushrooms, and truffle salt - topped, of course with some shaved parm.   Yum.  Desert was top notch as well.  Bread pudding... A la mode, of course.   Buttery, not too sweet with the all-important-for-bread-pudding perfect texture.  Service was friendly and made you feel right at home.  We'll definitely be back soon.  It's a great place to have a nice, leisurely paced meal with friends.  Good drinks.  Delicious entrees.  Great service.   No hint of snotty prentiousness that often goes with this kind of menu."}
{"text":"Please go to this place if you want to enjoy excellent food, atmosphere and drinks. Went with my family today and everything was excellent! Best cranberry Mojito and Margarita. The Market burgers were fantastic! The homemade potato chips and french fries fantastic! And whoever said the wings were anything but extraordinary is out of their mind! They were delicious! Hat's off to The Market By Jennifer's! Can't wait to go back and enjoy. What an excellent time!"}
{"text":"Checked out their happy hour on a Thursday. Too hot for outdoors, but not crowded inside this day. Happy hour until 6:00. Good selection of local brews for $3 during happy hour. Tried the wings and fried balls. Both excellent. Not a large space, but really nice. Will definately be back, especially since within  a 2 minute walk from our place."}
{"text":"I had the grab and go sandwich and my husband had the pepperoni metro pizza. Everything was so bland and extremely underwhelming. I can't believe how tasteless it was. 4.50 for the driest, flavorless pizza and the sandwich was 5.00. It has been awhile since I've been this disappointed in food out. Only thing redeeming is the customer sevice. This place is too all over the place in food choice, it needs to stick to a few things and make them outstanding."}
{"text":"Wow! All I can say is WOW!  Upon our way out the door a nice gentleman asked us to take a survey. When asked what we were looking for, I explained that they had Gluten Free soy sauce but that it was over $6 and the regular was under $3. With that, I mentioned that I was visiting and wanted to have sushi but couldn't eat regular soy sauce for medical reasons. Understanding my situation, he price matched the two items. I am now able to eat sushi this week and could not be more impressed with their customer service."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars before I even finish my meal. I had bid on a catered wine tasting meal from an auction for the SW Ctr for HIV/Aids fundraiser. The meal started out with happy hour cocktails and then progressed into Prosecco and the BEST EVER scallop and citrus I have ever tasted. Then there was a green goddess salad and Pinot Grigio, with crisp thin green beans, zucchini and broccoli...so fresh! Then an amazing corn bisque and caramelized popcorn. Who knew? Salmon in a red wine with Pinot noir and later, a filet mignon and Cabernet Sauvignon. Even though I have a Type A blood type, I thoroughly enjoyed the tender meat and willingly am taking the consequences. Meanwhile live music from Korbe Canida is taking the enjoyment factor to another level (in addition to the varied lovely artwork which changes every few weeks). Dessert was white chocolate mousse and the caramelized popcorn and raspberry tart. Ok we have all agreed coming back is mandatory for brunch and dinner...great wine selection and very impressive quality of food. \"Definitely come back\" \"food was way beyond\"\"very impressive\"...\"a hidden treasure\" from attendees. I need to repeat this event. Family and work events, as well as any catering, in the future, I'm sold."}
{"text":"The California Turkey Sandwich is delicious! But the customer service is horrible, and \"elitist\". You're definitely on your own when it comes to figuring out how to order where to find drinks."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my friend's house.  I went there on Thursday night, 8pm with low expectations.  We were the last table so I was already a bit cautious because no one wants that title.    The waiter Bo was remarkably cheerful and very knowledgeable.  He made some excellent suggestions and made the experience perfect.  The menu is perfectly balanced.   Nothing too complex, very appropriate mix of cuisine and flavors.   Great atmosphere and frankly underpriced for the quality.  I had the burger which was easily in top 5 all time.  I was tempted to go with the Spaghetti alla Carbonara but will order it the next time I'm there.  In an era where restaurants try to be something they're not The Market stays grounded and does everything really, really well.  Great place for a date (first or 100th), business dinner, long lunch (tip 30% if you're going to order 2 salads and 2 iced teas and stay for 3 hours).    Great job, everyone!  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I called to see if I could order a Christmas Eve dinner for pickup. A man answered and said he was making a drink and would get right back to me. I waited over 5 min listening to laughter. Hung up when no one came to my yells of \"hello\". Supreme disappointment."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great employees who make you feel welcome and well taken care of.  We went for brunch and everything was fantastic from the vegan chicken and biscuits, their version of eggs Benedict and something yummy I can't pronounce or spell.  I will soooo be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  The need to get their name out there a bit more...."}
{"text":"I've only heard positive things about the Chef of Jennifer's. She is a well trained chef and has worked in many very prestigious restaurants.   I came here for restaurant week and whoever prepared the food clearly wasn't Jennifer.  The best dish of the six we tried was the soup and sammich appetizer. The soup had little taste and seemed like half and half with pureed squash that was decorated nicely. The sandwich was tasty Grilled Brioche Bread that was stuffed with quality cheese, local honey and fresh pears. My husband had Arborio Rice that was still hard and not very creamy or tasty it was very flat and dry.  My second Course was Patagonia Salmon over a  Sunchoke Puree  that was getting broken up by a big puddle of oil. The Fish was topped with not so tasty combination of raw tomatoes, and brown chunks of garlic and some fresh basil. The Fish was edible.   My husband's Fresh Pasta Dish seemed like boxed spaghetti  instead of fresh pasta that was prepared mushy and seemed sort of watery.  At this point we were checked on and my husband informed the waiter about Hard Arborio Rice and Mushy Pasta. The waiter seemed sorry about that and walked away.  I was hoping that desserts would be redeeming but for me they were the worst part of the meal.  My favorite dessert is Lemon Meringue Pie so I was hoping the Mason Jar Lemon Meringue would be delicious. The Meringue wasn't Meringue but tasted like that gooey jarred Marshmallow Stuff called \"Fluff\" It was terrible to me. Nobody goes out for dinner and expects to receive  jarred \"Fluff\".My husband was hoping for an apple Tarte Tatin. You can tell by the photo he didn't receive a Tarte Tatin. I didn't taste his dessert because I was too grossed out by the Marshmallow Fluff I just had but he said the dough was really weird.   Maybe this is a really good sandwich place and not a dinner place? Maybe i hit this place on an off night and it's a possibility you might get a better prepared meal. I don't know.  This was more disappointing to me than the not so fresh sushi I had last week somewhere.  Jennifer needs to taste the food her cook prepares before it's too late.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food! Husband had the burger which is said was a perfect balance of meat and brioche bun and perfectly cooked. Son had the ahi nicose which was amazing. I had the kale and quinoa salad which was superb. Perfect balance of flavors and textures in all our dishes. Our first time here and will be back again and again. Fantastic farm to fork freshness!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally! A clean market, deli and coffee shop located downtown. Plenty of fresh produce and a selection of packaged goods many of which are from Annie's. There's a decent wine and beer selection and even a MTO sandwhich deli counter as well. For you coffee aficionados, the brand is Stumptown...hailing from good ol' Portland Oregon.   If you're not on foot there are several lots nearby and street parking around the corner, most of which are for pay.  If you are a member of El Cortez, Sapphire or higher, the garage across the street is the most convenient and secure.   The nice sized patio out front is perfect for you to sit and enjoy your purchases and interact with the local passersby.   His/hers public restrooms were clean but the new trend of shared communal sinks/mirrors is weird; likely in place to discourage bathing.  This will be my new goto for groceries; sorry Fresh N Easy (and Trader Joes) you're too far away."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and service! I went first for the Wednesday night wine tasting dinner. Second time for a late lunch. This time, I had the butternut squash soup & the kale quinoa salad. Both were excellent. Nice wine list, too."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday and absolutely loved it. Cute place, good food and great service. We had the chilequilles which were amazing. Taylor, our waiter, was the nicest. We would definitely go back and highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"So it seems that the owner of this business is just as unprofessional as her employees! After my conversation with them on Wednesday, today I received a call from Jennifer and a voicemail that was largely sarcastic in tone, as well as unapologetic for her employee's behavior. Also in the voicemail was her distaste for my yelp review that she called \"harsh\". She does say \"I apologize\" at one point in a tone and verbiage that is clearly an \"I'm sorry, I'm not sorry\".  \"Hi Rae, this is Jennifer with Jennifer's catering... I would love to chat with you. I know that you chatted with Amanda yesterday and I see you had a \"very large problem with that\", so I'd like to talk to you about that. I apologize if she came across...um... harsh? But... uh, yeah... this yelp review is awfully harsh too. BUT, I think she was just going by the guidelines but, uh... obviously that was very (inaudible) to you so I'd like to discuss.\"  Jennifer ends the message by leaving her number and an extremely curt \"Thank you\".   How inappropriate can you get?!?  The only reason you have my information is because I gave it your staff member before I realized what kind of a company I was dealing with. The information was given under the pretense that I wanted to hire you to cater an event, not call and complain about my very accurate, well deserved yelp review and subsequent review update.   A tip: Don't call and leave voicemails complaining about yelp to the yelper who left it for you in the first place. How in the world do you have a successful business when you don't know the basics of customer service, hospitality and appropriate business behavior?   I'd also like to add, if you had called and were actually professional, apologetic and genuinely concerned about \"very large problem\" & the poor experience I had in the first place, instead of your yelp reviews, I would have gladly changed/amended it to say that you called and cared. Instead, you shot yourself in the foot and now this is here...   To anyone who is thinking of hiring this company, you've been warned! As for me, I've moved on and booked someone else."}
{"text":"My husband took me to this place last week and what a delight it was! We went for Sunday brunch. From the moment you walk in, I loved the industrial/rustic feel with the beautiful chandeliers that hung.. 5 of them to be exact. The place is not very big, but that only adds to the charm and cozy feeling. The staff was superb, sharing information about local fresh ingredients used and we even got to taste a special dish that one of them was photographing! The food was phenomena!! My kids are not big \"kid meal\" type kids, they enjoying eating what the adults enjoy eating and my family felt very welcomed here. Everything we ordered came in generous proportions, very fresh, incredibly delicious, and excellent ingredients... just down right fantastic. I love quaint places like this where the chef comes around to your table and talks to you, it just adds to the whole dining experience! If you are looking for something new that will excite your taste buds, come to this relaxed setting and enjoy fantastic food!"}
{"text":"A good choice for sandwiches and carry out. Want to assemble a cool vegan cheese tray? This would be your go-to place. I tried the vegan chocolate chip cookie, and it was good. Service was great and friendly as well. Thanks The Market for having some healthier choices."}
{"text":"Bree (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was friendly and personable. I love patronizing a business with friendly folks... why give my hard eared money to meanies. This little market has a small produce area and a nice selection of pantry items to go along with their coffee bar/pizza kitchen/sandwich counter/salad bar. Most items are comparable to local grocery store prices. It is a great place to stop and grab a quick sandwich and Peet's coffee when you are on the go downtown. As of 8/26/2015, they have a Yelp check in offer for a free coffee (Yep, Peet's!) with purchase.  They also have a sandwich special that is $5.00 for a pre-made sandwich, chips and canned soda. Hello, bargain lunch!  They also carry freshly made cookies that are too huge and was under priced and a few varieties of the nearby O Face Donuts."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden Gem in Arcadia off Indian school. Has a cute interior and outdoor patio that has been dog friendly. My dog has always been given a bowl of water, on top of that Iv yet to have had bad service. Everyone has been lovely and I get the sense they enjoy working here.  Now to the food. It's fresh and much of it to my understanding is locally grown. The menu is not overwhelming so what is on it has been outstanding.  They used to serve breakfast during week but sadly now it's only on weekends. They often have live music on some week nights and during brunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've had to run by this place and it's amazing smelling food when I do Crossfit at Sol. It's torture. So my friends and I decided to try this cute little trendy delicious place!  First, let's say the service from Youlanda was OUTSTANDING! She was so sweet and down to earth, a great quality for a server. She did amazing at explaining all the items on the menu, she gave us her favorite item in each category of the menu. You could tell she really enjoyed and had a passion for the food served.   We started with the chicken tortilla soup. It had  incredible flavors! Creamy, fresh and bold!! (Oh and we got the yelp check in-free grilled wings! Yum!) We also ordered the Charcuterie board, the cheese board and the bread board and split the items. It was too much food for two people! But we really wanted to try it all!!   We enjoyed all of the meats and cheeses! I can't wait to come back and try more items! My friends ordered the yellow fin salad, which looked fresh and they had no complaints!! My friend who has been to Nice, France had the yellow fin nicoise and said it was on point :)   We also ordered the Mille Feuille. It was sweet and tart and the panna cotta.   Everything was awesome! Thank you for the wonderful service Youlanda!"}
{"text":"Amazing green godess salad--I had mine with chicken & my husband had his with Salmon...their proteins were perfectly cooked (tender & juicy) and seasoning was on point! Had an order of grilled chicken wings as well which were soooooo yummy.   They had live music too! A small, cozy & awesome place--Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost everyday at the cafe. I'm so lucky to have it here. It's delicious and I have never had anything less than amazing customer service!   I'm not sure where all the complainers are coming from, but the bronze cafe is legit!"}
{"text":"This place does very well because of its location and lack of other markets around it. I always go by default and there are some positives and negatives to it.  Staff is always iffy. I once waited 7 minutes at the counter before anyone noticed me. I always let the little things go but it was a long time. They never have any meats to cook at home. It's a market for people who live in the area and there isn't ever any meat. The shelves are always kinda barren. Very limited selection and what they have is usually over priced.   Store is usually very clean. I love the orange juice machine. It juices fresh OJ for you on the spot. So that's what I mainly go for. Some veggies and fruit are good too there. If u go to the counter make sure you ask for bacon jam scones. Trust me. You won't regret that move. Make sure you get more than one, you are going to need it.   All and all this place is good. I feel it wouldn't be if they had more competition."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix just for the evening and relied on Yelp for a good place for dinner. What a gem it handed us. The server was friendly but not obtrusive. The other server would step in and fill our water glasses when ours was busy. We ordered the cheese board, which was enough for four people and not two. The kale salad was excellent. The chef came out and gave each of us a taste of a dish he was working on. Can't go wrong with place!!"}
{"text":"The bacon and egg sandwhich here is one of the best I've ever had. Enough to make me want to move to Vegas. Seriously delicious. I'd go for 5 stars but the first time I ordered it it took 20 mins so speed is a little slow but every other time was faster and every time it was ah-may-zing!"}
{"text":"The service is always outstanding which is incredibly hard to come by! However, the inventory is pretty pricey & the shelves have been empty since I moved here last year. Most of the item's prices are missing from the shelves or the prices don't match the items. I read a notice today that they are reducing their inventory to allow them to remodel & focus more on the \"cafe\" aspect, which is GREAT! I still think their cafe prices are a bit high, though :( I will always support this place based on the service alone, I just wish they had more vegan selection & better prices. Because of this, I don't come here as much. The sandwich I had on my last visit (can't remember the name but it had avocado), was absolutely delicious but again, I expected a bigger sandwich for the price. You also have to be careful with the desserts cause they can be pretty hard. The dessert I got (monkey bread I believe?) was so hard & tasted so stale I couldn't eat it. As always though, they were more than willing to make me happy & give me a refund. My boyfriend always complains about how \"wilted\" the salad bar looks so he refuses to eat here..LOL I look forward to seeing the new remodel... Hopefully sooner than later! lol"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Hoobastank - The Reason)  I'm not a perfect yelper There's many things I wish I could have tried But I continue learning I always want to try the things you cook And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason to stay To eat the meals I want to try A reason to start over new At The Market by Jen's   This place definitely is cute and lovely.  I came for dinner with a friend.  The place was pretty slow since we came early on a weeknight.  We both order a couple of wines to start.  For our appetizers we shot for the Heirloom Tomatoes & Watermelon.  Great start I must say, the sweet cherry tomatoes and acidic oranges neutralized the bitter arugula while the watermelons subtle taste eased it all up!  For our entrees we ordered the Organic Chicken and the Ricotta Gnocchi.  I didn't really care for the Chicken entree, it was pounded down flat breaded and seasoned and topped with a mixed salad.  I didn't really get much out of it since I felt the Sherry Vinaigrette was too light; I wanted a stronger creamier sauce!  The Ricotta Gnocchi was the better of the 2 entrees.  The dumplings were soft and warm to the bite while the roast pork brought a wonderful surprise but welcoming protein to the meal.    Overall, I enjoyed my visit to The Market.  Our service was stellar and the place was charming.  In the end, ambiance made my night, but for me the food reminded me of a wedding dinner. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great selection, including vegan items. The staff was very friendly and helpful. You can eat here as well as buy from a unique selection of groceries. We loved the Negocio bowl for lunch. There are a bunch of other items I can't wait to try next time. Also loved the desserts. Five stars!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot if you are not sure what you want to eat but want a variety of choices. I love that they have vegan options too. I stopped in to get some Virgin vegan cheese the staff member that helped me was very courteous and she even pointed out the sampler of Virgin cheese. Which I ended up purchasing because I definitely needed to get a taste of everything since they were $12 for 5oz."}
{"text":"I love that there is now a market downtown that has healthy food selections, and is safe, and has a deli, espressos and beer and wine and a place to sit, that is a lot of ANDS, and each one is well deserved.  It is great when you have visitors and want a break, this is an oasis to get away from the noise and the party energy. There is a great selection of deli items and a salad bar with other food choices. They offer a little happy hour as well. There were great desserts and I should not forget the pizza. If I need a little fruit as a snack, or before I headed home I could pick up grocery items, it is all there!  What was great, there was outdoor seating as well as indoor, and it was nice to have a quiet place to eat and enjoy the food. It is like a coffeehouse/market/wine and beer bar all mixed in one! I know I will be back"}
{"text":"So very good. Everything served was completely delicious. I will gladly visit here again. Try the carbonara, the mac and cheese and he bread pudding."}
{"text":"Just rude... they run out of oranges for freshly squeezed juice half way through serving my bottle (self-service machine), which is ok, but when I went to ask for help, the guy took the half-filled bottle out of my hands and just throw it. My husband asked why he could not give me the partial bottle instead of throwing it, and he answered 'we just do not do that' in a snarky tone and without an apology. First, you should apologize when you run out of a product you serve, second, you should never take product out of your clients hands, third, you never through product that your client wants to the trash in front of your clients, no matter what explanation you think justifies that. On top of that, it took 10 min for my husband to get a double espresso because they forgot."}
{"text":"Great meal! Great service. This is a small but eclectic place to enjoy a good meal for a fair price. They pride themselves on using local sources for food. We enjoyed everything we ordered for dinner. The watermelon salad was refreshing. The grilled calamari appetizer had a great flavor with a kick to it. For my main entree I had the Ricotta Gnocchi. Yum! Amazing flavors.  Kyle our server was excellent. Attentive and engaging in conversation. Definitely will be back to try other creations as this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! It is located in the Arcadia neighborhood, which tends to have pretty good cuisine. It's located in the back/side of a very peculiar strip mall that has an old-fashioned feel to it. The restaurant itself has a modern but rustic design. It has both indoor and outdoor seating. We came here for Sunday brunch, and there was live music to serenade us throughout our meal. We were seated on the patio by request. The weather was quite nice at this time so it was perfect. The restaurant was far enough from the main road to have minimal car noise and smell interference.   The brunch menu was pretty diverse from seafood to Hispanic-inspired dishes. They do have bottomless mimosas/blood mary/bellinis...just FYI! My friends ordered coffee, and the presentation was adorable! First, the cup of coffee itself was enormous. Then, they serve it on a dish that holds the spoon, cream, and sugar. It ends up looking like all-in-one coffee kit. I ordered the carne adovada omelette and was able to substitute with egg-whites. The meat was pretty juicy and tasty. We also ordered some desserts which were very rich and tasty.  The one downside, a very important factor, is the service. My friends and I stayed about 3 hours since there was much socializing to be done. It was busy when we arrived but slowed significantly halfway through our visit. During the whole time, our waiter was not very engaging. He was very short and was constantly walking away as he talked to us. After we paid, we stayed for probably another hour. He never came back to refill our water or check in."}
{"text":"We specifically chose to eat here as The Market has a fantastic selection of gluten-free options...did I say fantastic?  I meant FANTASTIC!  David and staff are/were incredibly attentive to my wife's gluten-free, soy-free, nonGMO requests.  After it was all said and done, David came to our table with the BEST vegan/gluten-free cheesecake that we've ever had.  The really nice guy who is the official \"greeter\"at the door welcomed us in like he truly was welcoming his best friends into The Market.  Keep up the great work everyone!"}
{"text":"Service was good but it was very slow and they weren't busy at all. The food was decent. Nothing stand out or memorable. I thought their kids meal was one of the best and most wholesome that my daughter has had at a restaurant.  My favorite thing was their bread board. We'd come back for happy hour and bar bites."}
{"text":"From bad service to worse service. No selection of food and now the service has inexplicably gotten worse. I was very excited for new ownership, but obviously the be careful of what you wish for concept should have been used. Hoping that they are just trying to figure it out."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(301/365) \"Grab And Go\"  Located on Fremont Street in DTLV, This neighborhood market is like a miniature version of Whole Paycheck.  Aisles of produce, beverages of all kinds, cheeses, snack, and even a frozen foods section is there, also a prepared foods food bar sold by weight is there for those who are fans of that kind of grab and go food.  I like their counter area where they have made to order sandwiches, desserts, and beverages by the glass, including Stumptown Coffee on tap! The Latte was good, but could've  been a tad bit hotter. Its a very welcome addition to the Downtown area.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"Happened to stop by for a late lunch right as happy hour started. Service was great, both our server Beau and the mgr were very friendly and attentive. We got free wings courtesy of previous reviewer Nicole and they were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. I also had the market burger which is delicious and my girlfriend had the wedge salad. Very happy that we finally stopped by this local spot. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the area and have been making a point to try all the neighborhood restaurants.  This spot is one we look forward to becoming regulars at in the coming years.  First off we were greeted by the owner and wanted to sit outside on the patio we realized its a bit crowded and on the small size so we sat inside and with the doors open you felt like you were outside.  The decor is upbeat clean and an over all great vibe. After briefly being seated our server came over Beau and took our drink order and gave us the days specials.  Needless to say I would have loved to to have ordered one of everything but I settled for a vegetarian omelet and my husband order the butternut squash breakfast enchiladas. (pictures added) The coffee was good (we are coffee snobs and drive 25mins to purchase coffee beans weekly) but the omelet was special light fluffy eggs with veggies I had not thought about putting with eggs.( roasted corn, green beans, caramelize onions, mushrooms and red peppers topped with shoe string fries).  I am a big salsa fan but no need with this omelet combo.  Let me talk about the enchiladas they are some of the best in town and would order them for dinner if they are on the dinner menu. The red sauce is definitely made fresh and very delicious. The service was top notch! Beau was very attentive, sweet and he knows the food not just the menu and he is spot on with his recommendations. Also the live music is a great added touch and they buy local ingredients."}
{"text":"Very quaint and cozy atmosphere... you can bring your whole family or just come with friends. I like it because everything is local and you can have a conversation. I would definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"1st time here based on yelp review. I Wil start off that this was the best meal I have had in Phoenix in the time that I have been back.  Started off with the burrata.  Fresh burrata served on a costini with slightly roasted basil with pesto- delicious just enough salt to make it interesting.  Next up a bowl of a gorgeous pesole, just enough spice and purple onion, sliced radish and shredded cabbage to add yourself- wow by itself could be the meal topper.   Had the three meat combo- beef tenderloin, fennel sausage and roasted chicken on mashed potatoes and veggies with a red wine reduction.  This was fantastic, crispy chicken skin seasoned just right, tender beef tenderloin and wonderful fennel sausage.  This was fantastic.  Ordered the bead pudding - way to savory for my taste (nola spoiled).  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and live music! Great atmosphere too! Fun to chill out at on Sunday afternoon with friends."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for a supermarket downtown, but The Market lacks inventory basics like meat and fresh veggies as well as service basics like eye contact and staffed registers.  While I want to be supportive and shop here every day, but Smiths is a better bet. It's sad because the location has potential.    This could be the place for interesting, curated selections but, at the very least, it should offer waffles without freezer burn and a bag of spinach."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch because it was one of the few highly rated places in the neighborhood that we hadn't been to and boy, we're glad we did!  Oddly, we weren't mentally prepared for bottomless mimosas, but it's great to know this is an option for the next visit. There will be a next visit.  Our server was really nice. We happened to be the only two people in the place for the first 30 minutes or so, but he was still very attentive and the rest of the staff was cleaning the place thoroughly. As someone who works in the restaurant industry, I enjoyed seeing that seeing that rather than people standing around.  Today we had the chilaquiles, steak & eggs, and the fresh cookies and milk. The chilaquiles are up there with the best I've had in Arizona. Somehow, the chips stayed crunchy the whole time and the tomatillo was fantastic. I also really enjoyed my steak and eggs. The cookies and milk were a great idea, but didn't think the cookies were special.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and there were about 15 more items we wanted to try. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Living near Fremont, so glad there's a market near me. Prices are a little high compared to grocery stores, but worth the convenience! Great line of hot food & salad bar available each day! Plus they carry my fav water - Icelandic!"}
{"text":"Jennifer, Jennifer how wonderful are thee. I might be dating myself when I disclose that I've had the pleasure of eating Jennifer's cooking when she was starting out in catering. At least, I think it's the same Jennifer. Her food was scrumptious then as it is scrumptious now. And creative. And fresh.  The location is a bit hard to find but once in, the interior is delightful.   I hope her place success because of the location and she starts to have loyal costumer and a cult following. The kind of place that spreads by word of mouth and people from the neighborhood who Become regulars there all know each other one way or another. A bit of a Friend's place.  Just by chance, when Irene V. and I were there, Jennifer herself was there giving an interview to New Times- ever friendly Yelpers we introduced ourselves and Jennifer was equally friendly to us.  We had ordered the charcuterie nosh board to share and she generously gifted us with an order of her famous roasted pork Cuban sandwich which we furiously said she didn't have to- but I mean, we're Yelpers and we love food- so once arrived, we helpfully enjoyed the sandwich, exclaiming over the robust flavor! Even without the unexpected gift, I would still write a 5 star review as like I had previously written, I loved Jennifer's food when she was strictly a caterer. Back then she had said she wanted to have a restaurant and I am happy for her her dream has come true. And I wish her many years of continued success!"}
{"text":"It's 1:30 am here and there is a line wrapping the restaurant for their oxtail soup that is served only on their graveyard menu 11pm - 9am.   The wait wasn't too long just 30 minutes but at this hour of the night I'm freakin tired. I just want my food, so it felt a lot longer.   The five of us all got their oxtail soup. When it came out, it was served with cilantro and grated ginger + rice on the side. We also asked for lime for those who wants to cut that grease a little.  The portions were generous with 4-5 pieces of ox tail, the soup was flavorful and had a lot of potential if it was just less salty and hotter. The carrots  was a bit too firm, but overall it was a good soup and I didn't expect this at a diner in the middle of a casino in downtown. I guess it is Hawaiian . I really recommend it for drunk people, it hits the spot."}
{"text":"The Market is a hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas. They also have the Bronze Cafe inside, which serves awesome food including fresh smoothies, something similar to Buddha bowls, and a biggggg selection of a vegan options and pastries. The Market carries specialty food items, fresh produce, alcohol, and some home goods. They are open 24/7 on the weekends. You can anticipate a crowd of hipsterish, liberals, millennial, also local employees stopping in for lunch. It is right on the main strip of Fremont street just outside the Fremont street experience. Reminiscent of bodegas in nyc. Love it!"}
{"text":"Jennifer's market is a quaint Arcadia neighborhood eatery serving a variety of local options. From mozzarella balls to a very flavorful posole soup- the quality and service were excellent. We also took advantage of the first drink 2cent special and had a house gin and tonic with muddled limes and a Rasberry Kombucha beer. They have happy hour ALL DAY Thursday's so we are definitely looking forward to coming back for one. We also appreciated that they have local items they use themselves for purchase - hot sauce (homeboys hot sauce) to some local eggs and produce as well!"}
{"text":"I am so happy such a beautiful and intriguing dining experience exists in the neighborhood I was raised in. I am always excited to see gems like this pop up, especially if they are in walking distance from my home!  I've been to The Market twice now and each visit has been lovely. The service is both kind and casual, pricing is outstanding, and the overall vibe is warm and unique. I say \"unique\", due to the space's ability to shine within Phoenix's all too familiar stripmall culture. Something that is incredibly difficult to execute out here.  Both visits I have ordered the nosh boards, which in my opinion seem to be their signature offering. I've had the charcuterie, as well as their fondue board and each is stunning in display and just delicious. The flavors of the meats and accompaniments blend perfectly, especially combined with their prosecco. Just perfect! My friend ordered the artichoke risotto and that too was amazing (not mushy or bland).   What I value the most about The Market is their knowledge in creating a complete experience for the customer. There's a certain low key flair I appreciate, from the decor to the artisan products they offer. Can't wait to visit for brunch!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood needs a grocery store badly and I walked in with high hopes and a shopping list about 5 items long. Out of the 5 totally normal grocery type items, they only had one. Don't go here if you actually need something. You'll be greeted with empty shelves and disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been in this place a handful of times, most recently to get a bagel and a coffee for breakfast. The market itself gets a couple stars for being clean, well organized and having most of the basic essentials one might need - the overpriced, organic health food version, but the essentials none the less. There's a also decent selection of cold beverages - both alcoholic and non. The breakfast experience drops this from a 3 star to 2. There's a take out and seat yourself dine in area for breakfast and lunch, but don't think that you can just pop in here quick for a coffee and bagel and be on your way. To get a bagel, toasted with cream cheese, you must first pick out the bagel from a self serve case, then bring it to the cashier, explain that you want it toasted with cream cheese, then the cashier hands it off to the cook. 20 minutes later someone elses bagel arrives, with melted butter all over it and a small amount of cream cheese. I didn't want to wait 20 minutes for another, so I just ate what I was served. To be fair, it was messy, but tasted decent. But if a basic chain coffee shop can get the bagel I ask for, toast it without smothering it in butter, give me a decent amount of cream cheese and get me out the door in a minute or two, why can't this place?"}
{"text":"The guac and mole sandwich is my personal favorite. Great coffee, tea, and the vegan chocolate cake is AMAZING! the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"So...landed in Vegas and my body said Lunch even though Vegas said breakfast. Thanks to YELP I once again found an amazing Vegan / Vegetarian restaurant.  Now it is REALLY a market but they have food service. The menu was a little overwhelming but the employees really help you come to that final decision.  Now I was with a non-vegetarian and he was able to make a satisfying selection.   It's always a good thing when you find a  reasonably priced -healthy choice -great service -ANYTHING!"}
{"text":"First visit, great atmosphere! Lots of things on the menu to choose from. Nice variety"}
{"text":"The service was commendable! The food was excellent for all members of our party. The waitress was attentive and the restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"It's the most wonderful time of the year in Phoenix! We are close to the end of the year and it's 57 degrees - the perfect time to go out for brunch and sit on the patio listening to a sweet lady serenade us.   The restaurant is right next to Crudo in the back of the building! Our server was friendly and made sure a heater was next to us since it can get chilly in the shade. I first ordered the seasonal Bellini and it was refreshing! My other half and I ordered the Steak, Eggs with Fries and the Beignets.  When we got our order, they had split the steak and eggs for us which was nice! The whole plate was divine! The steak was so tender and I love the combo with fries!   We then got our Beignets and it was light, sweet  and exceptional! Our tab was close to $40 plus tip. I wouldn't hesitate coming back especially since they have Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Great turkey sandwich and Peets coffee. Also, a good grocery selection with a decent amount of organic food choices."}
{"text":"While in town visiting friends, we had a Saturday night dinner at The Market by Jennifer's after visiting the Desert Botanical Gardens. We're from the Omaha area and accustomed to some truly outstanding dining options (no, really, you should check it out). The initial impression was mixed. The interior has a warm and urban environment. However, I don't really get the idea of a big screen TV in here. It's distracting and doesn't seem to fit the experience.  We had the farmhouse cheeseboard and calamari as apps. The cheeseboard was very good with a blue cheese and a tapenade that were outstanding. But the calamari lacked even a subtle cracked black pepper seasoning. Four different entrees were selected by our table. I tried a bite of each and would have been thrilled with any of these. I chose the risotto with a side of white bean, which were both just amazingly good. Two of our group had plates with beef tenderloin. Coming from the home of Omaha Steaks, we could not have been more impressed the quality of the beef and the perfect execution. The fourth member of our party ordered the salmon plate, which I had debated getting. I'm picky about salmon, perhaps too much so. A hot, crisp exterior and a warm soft center are THE goals. It couldn't have been prepared better. The surprise was the puréed parsnips served with the salmon. Simply amazing! I'm over fifty, so my memory and hearing are less than reliable. I don't recall our server's name, but he provided the right mix of knowledge, attention and opinion. Could not have been a much better experience."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of working with Ali and Jennifer for our wedding celebratory dinner @ the Restaurant 'The Market by Jennifers.'  It was truly amazing.  Neither my husband nor I, had ever been to the restaurant or used Jennifer's catering.  Strictly by reviews and restaurant write-ups for great places to dine in Phoenix, did we come upon them.  They hosted a lovely 35 person seated dinner in their restaurant for us.  We live out of state, and as you can imagine it takes a lot of communciation to get things done right for this type of occasion.  They were both gracious and helpful throughout entire process.  They even hosted a friend of ours to try some of the items for the pre-selected menu, in order to ease any concerns about not having tried their restaurant.  Very gracious.  The food was so delicious, from the roasted veggie boards, to the tender asparagus salad and amuse bouche of shrimp toasted coconut with curry sauce.  To the wondeful, salmon, petite filet and lovely dessert of banana pudding and flourless chocolate cake.  Our guests were very impressed and quite a few remarked they will comeback.  Everything was prepared just right and the wait staff did excellent job of preparing guests for how things were prepared by chef.  It was a culinary delight.  To our surprise they even had live acoustic guitar player and singer in the restaurant that night, which was bonus fo us, as we hadn't planned music for guests.  We loved it.  At the end of our evening my husband and I, were given a couple bags of goodies to take as congratulatory gift for our recent wedding.  Again I can't say enough how gracious everyone was.  I would highly recommend trying restaurant, or catering service, as they really did take care of us.  Overall we give 5 stars for food, staff, atmosphere with music and being tucked in far right corner of street, which gives restaurant their own charm.  Our best hope in hosting this dinner was to have everything taken care of to finite detail, so that we could just arrive and enjoy our guests and dinner and they far exceeded those expectations.  Thank you, The Market by Jennifers!!!"}
{"text":"The Market gives customers a unique shopping experience due to its location and the items offered. Located in DTLV (not too far from the Downtown Container Park), it is a prime spot for locals living around the area, or for the folks who need to go in and grab a few snacks and some drinks before venturing into the Fremont craziness.  They had a small produce section, which is kinda cool because there's not many places near that zone where you could buy fresh fruit that's NOT an apple or banana from the local coffee shops.   I stopped in here to grab a couple CLIF bars and bottled water. They didn't have a huge selection, but at least you can find your grocery basics here. Super convenient for those who don't want to travel to the nearest Vons or Smith's (etc.) and are in the area.  I liked the fact that they had a food bar/buffet because it allows you to choose from different items and portion them the way you want it... all the food on display looked so good! I really have to come back and try their fare sometime."}
{"text":"We lucked out and got a reservation for New Year's Eve and all I can say is WOW. It was my first time there and I will be back many times over and over. It was AMAZING. The fixed  dinner options were so wonderful, service was great and the entire night was so great. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Jennifer'S. Stick to catering where you don't have a customer service component. A service based business should at least require staff to interact with customers. If your staff can glare at customers they can at least fill water glasses."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Order The RSTLNE and The LGBTQ, both were heavenly. We will be coming again."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I have to speak on the atmosphere, which is incredibly inviting. I'm typically pretty introverted, but this place made me feel social almost immediately. Taylor was our server, but that didn't stop the owner, Jennifer, from making sure we had what we needed right off the bat. The chilaquilles and breakfast sandwich were to die for, and my fiancé and I really struggled with sharing (not a normal occurrence). The staff truly cares whether you have a good experience or not. As someone who has spent over a decade in the service industry, I knew almost immediately that I should become a regular here."}
{"text":"Unbelievable lunch! Burger was the best ever! Also had the ahi yellowfin tuna which was perfect! The mussels appetizer was also fantastic in a red curry sauce, perfectly seasoned!  Finished off the meal with homemade beignets.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Trying some place new monthly. Friend chose Marketplace. Quaint, little restaurant on a Sat night. Seemed like the server was new. Bread board just ok. Wedge salad ok. Friend had risotto which she said was ok. I had ricotta gnocchi. Was light but also melting into other ingredients. Understand they are also good for breakfast/brunch. Dinner was nothing special."}
{"text":"Jennifer's did our wedding and we, and our guests, could not have been happier with the amazing food, service, and attention to detail.  I have also used her for several corporate events and my clients always appreciate that little extra that comes from the experience.  Professional, classy, delicious, perfect."}
{"text":"We were part of a large gathering of about 25 friends brought together to honor a newly wed couple.  The restaurant did not miss a beat; truly organized.  Tables were nicely arranged and the staff was highly efficient, despite a milling, high-density crowd through which they needed to thread themselves.  Appetizers, salad, main course (four choices) and dessert were delights to the palate.  Even though there were other tables occupied by diners unrelated to our party, the setting was such that they were not obtrusive.  The beer and wine selections were ample but not overwhelmingly large, yet selected with a keen eye.  A tiny wine bar (perhaps they served cocktails) was tucked away in the corner.  The decor was ecclectic -- a colonial style colonnaded veranda connecting through French doors to one large interior room graced by what appeared to be three Czechoslaviakian crystal chandeliers, a large-screen tv, chalk board menus on the wall, an expansive serving portal to the very large kitchen and a wall of glass-doored refrigeration units -- and yet despite this unusual collage of appliances and fixtures, the ambiance of the space was very pleasant.  We all could not have been more satisfied.  This place unquestionably is a winner."}
{"text":"We stopped in for early happy hour. We had a couple of appetizers and a glass of wine. The experience was so so, nothing to write home about. The staff, owner and perhaps several friends were huddled at the end of the table talking..and not being very attentive to their other patrons. We moved on."}
{"text":"Hanging out in Vegas is only expensive if you do it wrong- classic symptoms of \"doing it wrong\" include: 1. Booking a hotel on the Strip 2. Paying for well drinks in a casino 3. Only eating at sit-down restaurants 4. Paying for parking. I've made seeking out free parking a game, and it's wonderful how much money you save/ few more miles of exercise you get per week!   The Market helps out with Numbah 3, and it does it well. The price for the per-pound salad and prepared food bar was 7.99 when I visited, fresh fruit was perfectly ripe, and the customer service was wonderful. They could improve their produce selection- no limes or lemons for hacking into serviceable wedges with whatever blunt instrument one finds in the hotel room. I liked the mini pecan tart, but their cannoli filling was not so great.    Will definitely come back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of the show chopped, and of course we had to visit the market since Jennifer the owner was on there. We were so excited to come here on our date night this evening. I am going to give a very honest and straightforward review.  When you walk in, it is very confusing, as there is no hostess stand nor anyone there to greet you so we stood around for a couple minutes until we were able to scope out a waiter and ask them if we're just supposed to seat ourselves even though we made reservations.  Once we sat down, and by the way, there were only two other tables in the whole restaurant, the staff seemed very confused and disorganized. I'm not going to get into the details, but I will just say succinctly that the service here needs to seriously be re-thought.  We ordered the vegetable platter, which was outstanding. We then ordered the Caesar salad with steak which we had to return because the portion of meat was all fat and gristle. We also ordered the salmon, which was good, however I didn't care for the pearl onions, and I expected there to be roasted fennel instead of a couple sprigs of fresh fennel. I felt like the Mandarin oranges were completely disconnected from the dish and didn't belong.  Lastly, we ordered the bread pudding. This was hands-down, the best bread pudding I've ever had. I know some of the reviewers think it savory, but for myself it was perfect because I don't like things that are too sweet, so keep that in mind if you order.  The most disappointing part of the entire evening was that we actually saw the owner Jennifer and she was walking around the restaurant and we didn't see her engage with any of the tables, including ourselves, which I think is really a missed opportunity to connect with your community.  I grew up in the restaurant business and my parents and grandparents went to every single table and thanked them and asked them how the food was.  That being said, we absolutely will be back to this restaurant because the manager was so gracious at the end of our meal, and sat down with us and spoke with us about the tasting menu. Also, I would come back just for that bread pudding!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with a groupon to try it for brunch.  We were not disappointed!  We both had the steak and eggs, which was savory and filling.  We also both enjoyed a Bloody Mary that was made with homemade mix.  We really enjoyed dining here and will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place in Arcadia, food and wine was very tasty. We tried several items and loved all of them. They even have a great kids menu.  Great outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. Can't wait to go back. However, we're not sure about the use of the apostrophe in the restaurant's name though. Any thoughts?"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are expensive and take forever. The service is a hit or miss. The produce is normally gross quality. The prices are outrageous."}
{"text":"Get the gnocchi. The waitress described it as pillows of happiness and she is 100% correct. We went for a quick bite after a long week of work and it met all my wants. Quiet, friendly, comforting food.   Will have to go back when I have time to relax with a cocktail and nosh board. That is what the neighboring tables were doing and it looked perfect."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed lunch here. I started with the butternut squash bisque soup and he had posole verde. Both were delicious and they were served on a board, mine with yummy popcorn and his with homemade tortilla chips. We decided to split the market burger and it was also very good. We had no room for dessert."}
{"text":"Great breakfast when they get the order right. Sometimes can be a little chaotic with the ordering process, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know where the picture for this market came from, but there was nothing on the shelves. The deli counter was empty, the freezer's were basically empty. There were posts on FB for vegan cheese that was being delivered, and the people working at the market had no idea what I was talking about and were very unfriendly and not helpful. And there is no parking, you have to pay to park in a lot behind the building. Not worth my time."}
{"text":"We were excited to see this place move into our hood. It seemed hip and a little more upscale than most of the local spots. Kind of like Beckett's Table. But it's not as cool as Beckett's. The only similarity is the lack of veg menu options. There are veg appetizers, but no entrees. All the same stuff we see on other new and old restaurant menus. I guess that's the thing to do - open a restaurant and copy other menus. Boring. And in our case disappointing. If they are going to copy we need a new upscale restaurant that copies and elaborates on Flower Child's menu."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while. It's cute, quaint and intimate! I went with a group of friends for Sunday brunch. The inside dining room is small so if you definitely know you want to go, I would recommend making a reservation.   Upon arriving I walked right in and found my group already seated. It would've been nice to see a greeter at the door but various staff nodded and smiled as I located my table.  SERVICE: I believe our server may have been new as we were all pretty much first-timers and would've liked more recommendations, knowledge of the menu and ingredients. He was fairly engaging, had a \"can-do\" attitude and was very friendly so that was very appreciative. Hewill surely get better with time.  FOOD: The food was delightful but portions are somewhat sparse! Nothing particularly memorable about the food or flavors. I think it fell flat of my expectations but hopefully there's the possibility of improvement.  Overall, it was a nice experience. Not quite sure, I would return."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the opportunity to check out Restaurants for Restaurant week.  The regular menu  has a number of great items on it so in addition to the tasting menu we had to order the Pasta Carbonara for the table.  Great service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Its located across the El Cortez. Upscale and a little pricey. Some items don't have prices listed and workers not very helpful in finding items. Sorry we bothered ladies standing around busily standing.  Deli has better service."}
{"text":"Service was great!! Try their coffee!!!! Food is fresh and healthy!! Arnold Benedict is phenomenal, comes w egg, hollandaise sauce and sweet potato hash brown! No bread!! Yay!! Carb free!! This is my go to post workout spot or just hungry and want a salad spot!"}
{"text":"Best French toast on the planet. The kind of bread they use changes often. My favorite is the cornbread strawberry jalapeno French toast. They have the bread pudding French toast more often, and it's my second favorite. The bacon is extremely high quality.   P.S. My gf says the quiche is the best she's had too."}
{"text":"On a quick weekend trip to Phoenix and turned to Yelp for dinner advice. I was not disappointed. The corn bisque alone makes me want to make the 12+ hour drive from Idaho every weekend. I also had the shrimp risotto and a Ginger Oh, Snap! cocktail, which were both outstanding. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. I will certainly be back to the Market on future trips."}
{"text":"Music and atmosphere were really nice. Waiter was pleasent and helpful. The appetizer and salad were the highlights of the dining expierience. The chicken was cooked well, but there was no sauce, no glaze nothing to pair it with. lettuce was placed on top with nothing. In an area of town where there is ALOT of competition, I expected more. I can tell this establishment is better than this."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch and brunch! Food was great, tasty and price is right! Live music on the weekends and fresh and healthy food, however the burger is to die for!"}
{"text":"Nice little store , very convenient since we live close by . Unfortunately the lack of customer service i.e no one at the register and no one seems to care if anyone needs help even when standing within the 5 feet of the main counter. this place is not convenient for a quick anything or stop in because it will take you longer to get served then it takes to make or purchase/find your desired item.good luck."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch and  brunch on Sunday. The food and vibe is perfection. Only complaint is the live music --not conducive to conversation. In the cooler months you can sit outdoors to avoid the music."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere & decor-- comfortable and lovely.  Our service was excellent yet relaxed.  However the food left soomething to be desired... during brunch a few weeks ago I tried the charcuterie board and the huevos rancheros.  Although the former was delicious, the portions were little mini bites fit for a dollhouse!  And I'm no huge eater!  The latter, huevos rancheros, was just ok.  The overeasy eggs were cooked perfectly, perched atop two thin crunchy tostada-like disks, and then smothered with thin red sauce.  Sometimes simple is best, but in this case it would have benefited greatly from a little side of something...anything... The other folks in my party tried the quiche (pretty itty), the ricotta gnocchi with pancetta (there were seven gnocchi.  Literally seven little pillows doused in SO much watery sauce), and the nicoise salad (the definite winner of the meal- nice size salad and fresh tuna).  I'd like to give Jennifer's another try, but there are so many places to choose from these days..."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a late lunch today- my first visit here!  He'd already ordered a bowl of house-made potato chips and sweet potato chips.  Tried the sweet potato, and it was very good!  Crispy, not greasy-feeling (nor tasting), and lightly-salted.  Wished I'd tried the regular potato chips...  I couldn't decide on the Charcuterie board, or the Local Farmstead Cheeses, so I asked our server McCall to describe both.  Both sounded lovely, but I chose the charcuterie.  McCall was confused and placed both orders, but was quick to offer to subtract the cost of the cheese board even though friend said it was OK to leave it.  (I thought the dish looked so nice that it would be a shame to just throw it out.)  So nice of her to let us keep the selection while subtracting the cost from the bill, and what great customer service!    Charcuterie: Arcadia Premium's Lomo, duck salami, black pepper salami, and prosciutto, with garlic aioli, pickled shallots, and violet mustard. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-market-restaurant-bar-by-jennifers-phoenix?select=rNPB7fAMmaH425Y9CkBNrQ  Enjoyed all meats except the prosciutto, but I've only enjoyed prosciutto when crisped (it tastes too gamey to me otherwise), and this particular cut tastes just like other prosciutto I've tried at valley restaurants.  I liked the flavor and textures of the duck salami best, but enjoyed the mild saltiness and clean taste of the lomo, as well as the texture of the black pepper salami.  The garlic aioli had a very mild garlic flavor, and none of the meats really needed the enhancement.  Crostini were lightly-drizzled with butter- very nice!  Farmstead cheese board, by Lara Mulchay, local cheese monger.  Service notes listed P'tit Basque, brie, manchego, and cambozola, but I think the brie was left out and replaced by a gouda.  As pictured (from left to right), this is what I believed we received... https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-market-restaurant-bar-by-jennifers-phoenix?select=D8HIji_3H76IRSPWr1dUIA  Cambozola, manchego, gouda, and P'tit Basque, with almond slivers, tapenade, and fruit compote.  My friend really liked the cheese with the blue bacteria strains (which to me looked and tasted like blue cheese, but milder than Point Reyes).  We asked McCall, who pointed to the cambozola and said it was the brie.  She was partly right, since cambozola is a mix of triple cream and gorgonzola, but this cheese was the only one on the board with a brie consistency.  Anyway, my favorites were the P'tit Basque on the farther right and the cambozola (loved the creamy texture, and I have a soft spot for gorgonzola).  All the cheeses paired well with the tapenade and my fave, the fruit compote, which today was apple in red wine (and I spotted a red pepper flake on top of one apple cube).    Btw, friend also ordered the Cubano sandwich, and I wished I'd taken a photo of it, because it didn't look like a Cubano to us.  What struck at him was the height of the sandwich, which featured bread that looked like brioche to me.  He expected it to be pressed, like a traditional Cubano.  What struck me was the BBQ'ish look of the sauce.  He took the entire sandwich home for his dinner tonight, so I'll update this review whenever I get a chance to ask him about it.  If I had to choose from the two to order again, I would get the Farmstead cheese board!  I look forward to trying out more menu items, as well as a few Jun Kombuchas.  The mango lemonade sounds delightful, as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided on The Market By Jennifer's for our Easter brunch spot when my in-laws were in town and it did not disappoint! After a little snafu with OpenTable, we found that our reservations had not gone through as we had thought, but they were very kind about it and still gave us a great table even though they were quite busy. The ambiance is very cute and charming, and the staff were incredibly friendly. My mother in-law & I ordered mimosas, which tasted super fresh and delicious! My husband loved the little area where he could hand pick his beer of choice, and both him and my father in-law both thought the coffee was great (an important thing for brunch to both of them.) I ordered the quiche of the day, which I was told was a green chile beef quiche and was somewhat wondering what that would be like. I was surprised when it arrived and was not at all green chile beef, but more of a veggie quiche, but it was absolutely FANTASTIC. I would HIGHLY recommend the quiche, even if you aren't generally a huge fan of them. The crust was buttery and amazing, and the \"filling\" of it was not overly eggy & truly just absolutely wonderful. My mother in-law ordered the chillaquiles and thought it was great, and my husband & his father both ordered the breakfast sandwich which they raved about. All in all, a great experience, and a place we will absolutely go back to!"}
{"text":"I came here after flying in from Seattle. The staff was fantastic! I came with 2 kids, they were accommodating and kind. I Loved the interior right away! I love the selection of local foods and drinks. I started with asparagus board. It was divine! Everyone enjoyed the food. We had burgers, salmon, fries. I wish this little gem was closer to me. I highly recommend it. The food was outstanding and the prices very good. Hope I can visit again."}
{"text":"Welp, mark this as my new favorite place. We were waiting for the dust to settle a bit and decided it was finally time to visit this new spot. Wow is all I have to say. The decor and atmosphere are great, the service was genuine and some of the best I have had and the food....ohhhhhhh the food. I'm not one to over eat, but I left in pain with how full I was and it was worth it.   We started off with the Bloody board -delicious and simple. I ordered the quiche which had chorizo, gruyere and spinach. Amazing! It was a good sized piece with a little salad along side it. I would eat that again a million times. Fiance had the steak and eggs. HOLY SHIT. I just about orgasmed over the flavor of this dish. I have never had anything so delicious and she only serves it on the weekends. If I had unlimited funds, I would eat that every day - morning noon and night. SERIOUSLY.   We decided, based on a recommendation, to get the banana's foster nutella bread pudding. We were like, \"oh we are full let's save this for later\". NOPE. Ate it right there like fat asses...and we ate all of it. There wasn't a bite left and I even upended the caramel container into my mouth. Yeah, that good.   I loved our server. They have a little market area with local cheeses and products and flavored salts. He sat with me patiently while I tried every flavor and explained to me why he liked each one, what he used them for and why they tasted the way they did. Another server came up and explained the cheese buying/making process from the local dairies.   I freaking loved it there and would return any day for more."}
{"text":"I forgot to review this place right away but we tried this hidden gem awhile ago.  All I can specifically remember was the amazing cheesey grits.  They were so good we bought a bag to go so I could make at home.... Although I haven't even come close to recreating their deliciousness.  Great atmosphere, great food and fantastic staff!"}
{"text":"So I am pretty happy to have found this place. When I lived in downtown SD we had Krisp, which was walking distance from our loft, I liked that place so much. I was wishing for a market like that when I discovered The Market here on Yelp. It's not walking distance, but LV isn't really known for it's walkability. It's nice because if I need a thing or two I don't have to make the trek all the way out to Whole Foods. They have a small selection of produce, although I don't think it was organic. I'm not sure though. I was impressed by their selection of vegan friendly foods, I found organic tofu for less than I would pay at Whole Foods, I thought for sure it would be more! They had all kinds of Whole Foodsy type items like Vegenaise, assorted dark chocolate bars, kale chips etc. It looked liked they carried a nice selection of beer and wine too. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh, well prepared and inventive food served in a bright, urban environment. Excellent service by well informed waitress. I chose the delicious shrimp and artichoke lemon risotto and my date had the Yellow fin Tuna salad which was sublime. We started with a fresh Asparagus soup that we shared and an absolutely fantastic chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce. Very reasonably priced for the type of food served. Wholeheartedly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"What a find! The Market is tucked away  (it faces 36th Street, even though it has a Indian School Road address) the food was delicious, the quiche was perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for a vegan and a meat eater to share a meal!  Delicious sammies,  salads, and omg . . . The breakfast options!  Eggs Benedict with sweet potato hash (or  vegan bene).  Breakfast nachos (they have a fancy name, but I'll butcher it).  This is our go-to place in Vegas. It's not fancy, not pretentious, but it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Hours are 7a to 10p   Awesome alcohol selection!  Cute hot food bar  Lots of organic options and good produce options  Cute lil pie and macaroon options too"}
{"text":"Great brunch atmosphere, amazing bacon & spinach quiche!  Lemon bergamot beignets, rich, fluffy & yummy! Duck, goose, quail & today Emu eggs. Locally sourced food, support this business! Just off Indian School on 46th. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you like to wait almost 40 minutes for 2/3 of your \"to go\" sandwiches to be made, go here. If you like going back to refill your parking meter for what should be a 15-20 minute MAX stop, go here. If you like your name being called to tell you your order is ready, only to find that 2/3 sandwiches are in your bag once you're in your car, go here. If you want to watch two other sandwiches be delivered to another customer that ordered way after you while you are still waiting on one of yours, go here. If you like to NOT receive an apology and blank stares for the amount of time you have wasted waiting, go here.   My little cousin could easily make 10 plus sandwiches in the amount of time I waited here. I cannot even fathom how it takes 40 minutes to make 3 sandwiches on a slow Sunday afternoon. There's no excuse for this not to mention almost all of the customers in the dining area either had coffee or self-serve food so it's not like there were a lot of \"made to order\" orders on the docket.   I live in the downtown lofts complex and will be sure to make my neighbors aware of the horrible service I received from the \"made to order\" bar. God help you if you happen to order \"to go\" from them on a workday for lunch.   P.S. As an added note, I have found many of the same products sold here at normal grocery stores for a fraction of the price. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"As a market where you can actually buy grocery items for every day cooking, this place fails pretty miserably. As a deli counter that will sell you coffee and sandwiches and smoothies, sure, it does that pretty well.  You might be able to discern that I'm disappointed in this place. We need a store that will actually have staple items in stock consistently in this neighborhood, but this place is not it. More often than not when I come in there's woefully little produce, and the dry goods can be hit-or-miss. Dairy is also semi-empty, but at least they have something of a selection and for that I am thankful. Liquor is available, and they do have a decent beer and wine selection, for the size of the place.  But honestly, this place is more geared towards the hot prepared foods bar, and the sandwiches they make at the deli. It seems that's where most of the staff work in this department, often to the detriment of using the grocery side. I've been stranded at that checkout lane more than once while a handful of sandwich orders were being put in."}
{"text":"I've always loved Bronze Cafe at the Center and go to this location for grab and go lunch frequently too. I didn't realize until recently that they'll do a full sit down dinner too! We had an amazing salmon/shrimp dish, a chimichurry chicken, and vegan \"fried chicken\" among other things, all of which were amazing! Chef Peter is a talent.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I axles ahead to see if they had a dog friendly patio and any happy hour! We got hooked up by riches he told us about the yelp special and I was in with the chicken wings. The food was great!!!' The polenta was the best! The good selection of craft beer was in a sweet little cooler! Loved it"}
{"text":"Excellent food at the cafe, all of their salads are excellent my husband loved the What What sandwich.  The service is inconsistent but the food outweighs  the service so I will continue to go..."}
{"text":"Every day it becomes worse and worse. No fresh vegetables, no organic eggs. The Market is turning slowly into Walgreens that is right around the corner."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for okay food. Sorry, I was hoping it would be a new favorite spot but I'm going to have to pass on this one."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is fun! Live music from 12-2pm (Michael Land was great - guitar with prerecorded back-up singing pop).   Patio is just OK. Small and faces parking lot.  Tuna Niçoise salad was great and a value at $14. Also the side of beans was delicious and enough for 2.  This place is a treat!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the all-natural breakfast menu, but the acai bowl was not worth it. It took a very long time to get made, and the portion was small, so I wasn't filled up. Wish I'd gotten the breakfast burrito or shakshuka.   However, the watermelon chia drink was so great. Try it."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm. I guess rules say that reviews can't be too laconic. So I will be kll0000"}
{"text":"Live music, great food, great atmosphere and great staff!  We can here for their AZ cocktail week menu on a Tuesday.  Arrived at 7:45 and they had a musician serenading the customers with some great sounds.  Upon arrival we were greeted and asked to sit wherever we wanted.  The AZ cocktail week menu was fantastic!  As you can see from my photos it did not disappoint.  Along with the cocktail pairings that were provided too!  My favorite item would have to be, hmm, all of them!  The deconstructed hot wings, the ceviche, the slider burger and of course the cookiewich!  All amazing!  We even ordered N additional dessert off the menu which was their housemade Twix candy bar!  Yum yum yum and yom yom yom.  They also have some local items for sale from local vendors.  We bought of homeboys Jalapeño hot sauce.  You can also pick up some fresh organic chicken or duck eggs too!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a cross between a deli and a small supermarket but the food is great, especially the breakfast. I've had breakfast here 2 days in a row and each one was superb (planning on going back a 3rd day). First day I had the Bendedict, a delicious egg dish, beautifully prepared and the second day I had an Acai bowl which was the biggest and one of the best I've ever had. They lean towards vegan, gluten free and healthy foods yet very tasty and well prepared. Coffee is really good too. Great recommendation for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Due to very questionable and suspicious interactions with this establishment's employees, not only was I not able to try any of their products but I have made the decision to not come back here in the future.  I was in the area looking for something to eat before I went to work. I passed by this business and saw that while most of the negative comments were towards the grocery store and customer service aspect of this establishment, it seemed like their freshly made sandwiches and the salad bar were given positive reviews.  The first employee I interacted with was kind enough to run me through the menu and he gave some suggestions. I ordered a sandwich and while waiting for it to be made I put together a salad from the salad bar and picked up a couple of drinks.  As I went back to the register there was a different employee with my completed sandwich and ready to ring up the rest of my items. I was told the price and I proceeded to pay with my debit card.   After the first swipe it looked as if my card did not go through. It was then that I noticed a different price was displayed on the register versus what was stated to me. I was told to swipe again but opted not to and pointed out the two different prices.   Up until this point, this second employee and I had not talked to each other that much. He just stated how he was looking forward to me coming back to try their other items. Once I pointed out the two different prices this second employee became very nervous, started to stutter with his speach, and in a very overly professional and robot-like tone, stated how he was going to speak with a manager to resolve the issue, and he walked away from the register.  Once he came back he began to speak in a whispered tone as to not embarrasse me and stated how my EBT card would not be able to cover the salad I was attempting to buy.  At the very least, this second employee was grossly incompetent. But with the possibly that he was trying to scan and dupe my card to drain my bank account (it has happened to me a couple of times this year already at other businesses) or that he automatically assumed to process my card as EBT card since I was a person of color, as I did not have time to get into with him,  I just walked out of the store without purchasing anything."}
{"text":"Stayed nearby for EDC and let me tell you the fresh juices we got from here each day gave us LIFE to survive the Vegas heat.  The juices are really large and at only $6, are such a great deal, especially since they are made fresh to order. You can choose your base from a bunch of fruits and vegetables, then you can choose to add in tumeric, lemon, and/or ginger for that healthy kick. First day we got green apple, celery, and cucumber with tumeric lemon and ginger. Second day we got green apple, cucumber, and beets with the same add-ins. So fresh and delicious but also healthy!  One of the juices they even gave us the leftover juice that didn't fit in the cup in a separate smaller cup, which I thought was so great of them!"}
{"text":"I just saw this market on Yelp recently and decided to check out their hot food selection, hoping that it would  be similar to Whole Food market.   The market  itself is very clean and organized. There's a deli with made to order (cold) sandwiches and a build your own salad bar.+ As for their hot food counter, it was very disappointing. There was a lot of stale fried food and very little veggie, nothing that look appetizing at all. It's too bad, because I really want to go out of the way to support mom and pop type of business."}
{"text":"Cute store with a great selection of vegan specialty foods. Tried Virgin local cashew-based cheese. $12. But it was really tasty."}
{"text":"What a great experience, I brought my wife and my 91 year old mother in law here for Valentines Day brunch. The service and food were very good and being able to sit outside on the patio was very nice. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a great little neighborhood place! The minute you walk in you feel like a friend. The food is fresh and innovative without being pretentious. They have a wonderful selection of wines including several local choices which I appreciate. The locally source a lot of their food as well. I am anxious to try their brunch soon too as it sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch here. We started with the guac and chips. Not your typical guacamole. Was a bit more creamy and was served with super thin potato and sweet potato chips. We then had the burrata, it was awesome! My mom really liked it because it did not have tomatoes on it. We then had the Pozole verde. It was amazing. My only suggestion is that they serve it with more broth. The server was nice enough to give us extra broth in our to go box for the Pozole. For dessert we had the beignets, they were awesome!! I would suggest ordering and splitting plates so you can try a lot of different things."}
{"text":"Casual cozy and overall a good experience. Our party had to sit outside where it became a bit warm even tho we had a reservation.  Facing parked cars wasn't what we expected. Toast was extra which I thought was a bit unusual, but everyone seemed to to be pleased with what they ordered. Would recommend as a casual fare."}
{"text":"This establishment is very obviously ill-equipped for a lunch crowd larger than five people. The ticketing system for the deli is essentially non-existent, creating unbelievable mis-management and disorganization. The cashier would deliver people's orders while there was a long line of people waiting to order and pay; the people supposedly making the food were obviously just wondering around behind the counter, completely lost on how to prepare something from their maximum eight-item menu.   The real kicker was that I ordered a $7 grilled cheese sandwich that I waited 15 minutes for (I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since there was a \"rush\") before going back up to the counter to check on it. They completely forgot about my order, but informed me that  they \"just put it in the oven\" and it would be another 15 minutes. At this point I had spent 25 minutes in this grocery store, with 10 minutes in line just to order, and asked for a refund. They, for some reason, could not process a refund back to my debit card, and therefore had to give me cash. At this point the manager had stepped in to finish the transaction, but was so detached from the situation that he didn't even ask if there was a problem, just handed me cash and moved on with his day.   While I wasn't able to actually get my deli food and review it, some of my coworkers actually received theirs, and felt it was mediocre at best. One of their sandwiches was even missing one of the main ingredients (avocado), and the other's food came cold. On a higher note, one of my coworkers really enjoys their mini pecan pies , so there's that.  It's really unfortunate that this is the only grocery store downtown. Hopefully they get it together in the next few months. If not, you're much better off at the ever-wonderful Sprouts, or if you're ok with spending The Market prices, your money is much better spent at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I was researching a spot for a large group for brunch and decided to stop in for lunch to check it out.  I had the best pulled chicken sandwich ever!   It was served on a cutting board with homemade potatoe chips.  Kayleen my waitress was wonderful and the  love the chic friendly atmosphere.  A great find!  I will be returning with our large group for sure!"}
{"text":"I consider myself an expert in the delicate delicacy of POZOLE (having lived and traveled throughout Mexico for many years).  Given this, I believe I can say that the pozole offered at  Jennifer's \"The Market\" is as good as it gets.  You won't find better pozole in all of Guadalajara where this dish originated."}
{"text":"What a cute local spot!  I had lunch with a friend and we got to sit outside at one of the long tables. There was live music playing and it was so nice out.  I got the Local Grains salad with chicken and it was very tasty.  The grilled chicken was perfectly cooked and a generous portion size. The wait staff was very accommodating too. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this restaurant a try for dinner and I'm so glad we did!   Ambiance: intimate and cozy with beautiful decor.   Service: very attentive and had great suggestions and recommendations which were appreciated.  Food: Everything we had was delicious and I love that they use local ingredients as it makes everything so fresh and yummy! To start we had the asparagus board which was delicious (excited to try more of their nosh boards in the future) and for our entrees I had the gnocchi which was AMAZING and will definitely order again. My fiance had the burger which I tried a bite of and it was delicious! For dessert we had the cookies and milk- so good!!! The milk is local and was incredible.   This place is a hidden gem, if you are in the Arcadia area you must give it a try! We will definitely be back for dinner and we cant wait to try brunch soon!"}
{"text":"We were actually pretty relieved to find The Market while walking The Fremont Experience. Apparently there used to be a hot bar along with the salad bar, but that's been done away with. However, you can still order food and drinks that are prepared to order via Bronze Café, located in The Market.  We found ourselves in here at least once a day, the entire time we were in Las Vegas. There are numerous grocery staples like  fresh produce, dairy, wine and beer, vegetarian/vegan meats and cheeses, etc."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a friend and was fantastic service wonderful food presentation was crazy! This could be my new local favorite hangout! I would definitely recommend this restaurant! I will be back for certain!  Pork ribs special for lunch. are you freaking kidding me? Absolutely off of the charts! Only my second visit but definitely a favorite that I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, Epic food,  and Rad Happy Hour.  A great Arcadia location and is beach cruiser friendly.."}
{"text":"We had high hopes, but breakfast this morning was very disappointing.  Signs in the charming little spot suggest local and fresh, but we asked for in-house squeezed orange juice and were told by the server that their juice comes from Costco.  We are food adventurers and don't mind paying for good bread.  Their bread board was $4.  We thought we would try it.  Horrible, no love in that bread.  The owner of this place should try Noble Bread or croissants from Essence Bakery for examples of what real and truly great bread tastes like.  We also had the posole, which was bland and tasteless in our opinion.  Staff seemed to realize that we were frustrated but we left without much in the way of resolution or happy feelings about this place.  With Matt's Big breakfast opening soon close by, Essence a short distance up the road, and gourmet places like Bink's Midtown nearby, this place simply does not hold up to the competition for breakfast in our opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped by the market today just to look around, After looking around I picked up a few things and I even ordered lunch in the café. I got the grilled cheese, I paid the extra $1 and got the onion and tomato. It was so good. The market also had nuts and voss water which I love. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Next time ill sit down and have a glass of wine with my lunch. Yes! they sell wine and beer by the glass. Enjoy!!! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool market that recently opened up just before you enter The Container Park in downtown Las Vegas. It reminds me of a miniature version of Whole Foods with similar price points.  They have interesting snacks if you ever get the munchies. Lots of brands I have never seen before. Original and innovative? Perhaps.   There's also a mini hot & cold foods bar with a cafe like atmosphere that also has a pastry case & fresh baked bread as well. A trendy looking mini-market that's worth a look around."}
{"text":"I came here for Virgin Cheese! It's all the way in the back in the freezer section. The rest of the shelves are almost bare- unexpected and creepy. Not the best selection. Upon checking out, the person manually had to input cards via a square swiper and iPhone. Womp womp. I'll come back for the cheese, but that's it."}
{"text":"The service here is the slowest of all time. There are always multiple people working and no registers open in the front, just the checkout counter where you order food. Ive been twice and i will never go back.  The buffalo chicken wrap was terrible. The bagels are also terrible. Avoid it."}
{"text":"What a delightful place! Came for happy hour and stayed till close. Our server TJ was super knowledgeable about all the menu options. We had appetizers, a salad and an awesome burger and wine. It's a super cute space with clean bathrooms.  But, there is an offensive smell near the door and the manager was not too friendly.  Great food and good entertainment.  If I'm in the area again, I will go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to The Market since it opened, and I was hopeful that it would be better stocked, with more reasonable prices after the new ownership took place. This, however, is not the case.  The establishment, in itself, is neat and tidy. The staff is generally pretty friendly, and today proved to be very helpful. My partner went to the cafe to see if they had bacon jam scones. They were out, as usual, but the clerk offered to call the other Bronze Cafe location to see if they had any. Unfortunately, they were out, as well.   I continued to do a bit of light shopping while he was asking about the scones. They only had half gallons of whole and 2% milk - and quite a few of them, most of which would expire in less than a week - but they had no gallon sizes. They only had cartons of 18 eggs, no dozens. The produce was fairly stocked, at least on the fruit side. They had Asian pears which looked good, but had no price marked.   And everything is definitely on the pricy side. They seem to capitalize on the fact that there isn't a real grocery store close to the downtown area and charge you for convenience.   When I went to get bread, I noticed that they had three different types of Texas toast, several loafs of an \"artesian\" bread by Sara Lee, and one loaf of sourdough. My partner and I were excited to get the sourdough until we saw that it had several moldy spots on it.   It definitely turned me off, and I put all my items back where I found them and walked out. This was my last time ever going to The Market on Fremont."}
{"text":"Save for Stumptown Coffee, unless one is stranded downtown with no other means to obtain food I cannot fathom a reason to shop at The Market.  From its overly precious feel to the frankly unappealing selection of baked goods and prepped foods I did not see one item here that made me think \"wow, I'd like to eat that.\"  Obviously not the target audience as I don't need craft beer and have a car that can carry me a few miles away to a larger selection at a lower price I guess this will have to do for the Downtown Project cohort until someone can coax a CityTarget or something similar into the area...though shopping there would probably be beneath folks with manicured facial hair and the latest in Thriftshop-chic who want to spend extra on a box of Lucky Charms or cookies that looked stale at 10am."}
{"text":"Went to the market JUST TO BUY VIRGIN CHEESE. if that's why you're going don't bother!!!! Literally and mini wedge of cheese 2 inches in diameter was $12.00!!!!! Seriously?! I was outraged. As a Vegan I am proud to show people that eating diary free isn't more \"expensive\" - Virgin cheese spits on that concept. I would have bought it if was $5 maybe $7 at most. BUT 12.00$?!?! Are you joking? I'll never buy Virgin cheese just because of the rape they call \"environmentally friendly\" cheese... what about economically friendly?!?"}
{"text":"Oh my!!! This place knocked my socks off!! I am so glad we stopped by this evening for dinner. I was aprehensive at first because it was nearly empty, but that changed as soon as we were dazzled by the amazing customer service from the staff.   My husband and I ordered drinks from their menu. He had a Moscow Mule, and it was tasty. I ordered an Old Fashioned, but it was a little to old fashioned for me...lol.. not throwing shade to the bartender, but I guess I really didn't know what I wanted. She recommended this amazing drink to replace the first one, I can't recall the name of it, but it had ginger beer and I believe it was a   Margarita of some kind. Bomb!! I am super obessed with that drink.   For dinner, hubby order The Market Burger, which was very nice on the eyes and his stomach. It was huge, a great value for the price of $11. I had the Pan Seared Salmon with sticky rice and boy choy with a balsamic reduction and mushrooms....it was damn good! Seasoned so well, and the fish was cooked to perfection! Sorry we didn't take pics, the food looked and smelled so good, it didn't have a chance.  I am not really much of a desert person, but I was so impressed, I ordered the brownie with rocky road ice cream and it was garnished with mint!! Woo chile, listen I ate all of it...super satisfied and I am a fan!! Will definitely be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I was having lunch at a neighboring restaurant and was in need to do grocery shopping for my meal prep. The Market is a pretty small store with more common produce items, cereals, frozen vegetarian treats, teas, coffee, non-dairy milk, chocolates, snacks, dried spices and mixes, O Face doughnuts, cookies, pies, etc. It's not a full-on grocery store so, there are items you won't find here. I was looking for fresh cilantro which they didn't have but they were nice enough to get me a small bunch from their kitchen. Talk about going above and beyond customer service!  That's what impressed me the most about this place. The people that work here are from the area and I think it's important for the local community to benefit from current development downtown. They're helpful and friendly. We got to chat with the chef that makes all the prepped food who told us how he makes his dishes and when they serve certain dishes. Soul Food Sunday, anyone?  Get a reusable bag for $5. They have items with clever marketing strategies: Bruce Tea if you're a Bruce Lee fan...Grumpuccino if you like Grumpy Cat. I'm a sucker for both so I ended up getting one of each flavor teas and coffee they have.  This may sound bizarre but they have the best shopping carts ever. They're tiny so, going up and down aisles and making sharp turns are easy. They're like the BMW of shopping carts: FWD + power steering.  Would I make a special trip just to shop here? No. But this would be the closest store similar to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods to home."}
{"text":"We had a nice family brunch. The food was very tasty, but the service wasn't great. We were a big party so, I'll let that pass and will likely go there again soon."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today specifically around a promotional dessert item they have been advertising.  The service was fairly good, a little slow at times but very nice.  We started with the Bread and Butter board, it sounded great with some of the reviewers talking about pretzel bread and jalapeno cheese bread, we had what appeared to be 3 types of bread but as far as taste went only one of them had a hint of sweetness over the other two maybe a raisin bread?  Not sure but they were a bit dry and although they tasted home made it did not taste like they were home made today, and there was no variety or distinctness to any of them. For entrees we had the Hamburger and the Cuban sandwich.  My mom didn't say anything about the Hamburger so not really sure what her thoughts were.  The Cuban is what added the third star, otherwise I would have went with 2.  Although I would classify it more as a BBQ Pork Sandwich than a Cuban.  The pork was very tender and tasty and the sauce was great the pancetta was so crisp you could mistake it for bacon (in a good way!).   We were then set to order dessert, however, unfortunately after we had ordered the waiter came out and told us they didn't have any.  If you are only serving a specific dessert for a month why would you not make sure that you have that in at all times, at least for the month.  It was extremely disappointing because there are several amazing restaurants in the area (we live 45 minutes away) and I am not able to make it out here very often.  If I had known they were not going to have what they were advertising I would have headed over to the Gladly or Citizen Public House."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday afternoon, and I have to say I wasn't so impressed. Most of the produce and deli had been wiped clean so there wasn't much of a selection at all. And for what was left on the salad bar, it didn't really look that fresh, considering it had been sitting out on what was a bit of a warmer day this spring. This surprised me though, since there seemed to be half the day left still, but maybe they just peak in sales during the morning, since it was a Saturday? Not sure. Prices were \"OK\" and didn't strike me to buy anything in particular. The beer/wine selection was alright. Honestly, it wasn't anything I couldn't find at a Smith's comparing prices. This seemed like a cool idea having a local grocery downtown, but for me, it felt over-hyped. I did appreciate the layout, and I liked how they wrote out the labels to each fridge--it gave it its own charm. I didn't have any food there, but there were just a few people there for lunch time, so maybe I will come back again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this great little local spot.  Got two glasses of wine and two grain salads with protein ($76 all in, so not a cheap date but I'm willing to pay for local quality!). Friendly service.  Nice and cozy setting"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  Breakfast sandwiches are made fresh when ordered.  Place is well lit nicely maintained and the employees were outgoing,  friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Jennifer's did an amazing job catering my wedding. They went above and beyond and took care of the food, rentals, even coordinating live trees for decoration! People are still talking about our hors d'oeuvres stations, (a innovative alternative to the usual buffet), each one a different theme that allowed our guests to graze all night! I would love to use Jennifer's again in the future, one word: flawless!"}
{"text":"Got a 'Miss Piggy' which is the chicken salad sandwich w/BACON! It was refreshing and delicious. Solid portion and the mixed greens w lemon vinaigrette really made it pop! Most impressed w the service. From the owner (I think) greeting us at the door to the people taking orders. Will definitely be back when in this part of town and feeling like getting something quick and yummy."}
{"text":"The place is too cute but the food was nothing special. The fish tacos tasted off and  there were only 2 tacos. Usually there's a solid 3. The ahi tuna bowl was kind of random and tuna did not look fresh. Both dishes needed some sort of drizzled sauce on top. The staff was pleasant. We were the only ones dining in the place on a Wednesday night. This place has so much potential too!"}
{"text":"First visit...all by myself.  Sunday pre-evening,  kid-free, errands done, glass of wine and a nosh desired.  Drove by, saw a light crowd, a patio, and a bunch of motorcycles.  Clearly not overly pretentious...so I stopped.   I had a very attentive waiter,  a lovely glass of wine, good butternut squash soup and an amazing salad with beets and pistachio vinegrette.  Happiness on a patio!   I look forward to a family dinner here to try the salmon :-)"}
{"text":"AMAZING and COZY!  Dude it's perfect!  It's the only market in ALL Downtown and it's all natural foods...so blessed im affiliated with this company!  DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS PROJECT ROCKS!  Ask for Ellyn, Sonia or Dylan...tell them I sent you for treats!!!'"}
{"text":"This place has great potential,  I am going lightly and regarding it has opening weekend pains, however at least 4 front of the house employees working and only 4 people in there (my friend and I included in the 4) I expected clearer direction.  I will go back a second time to form my final opinion.  So below will be my first impression.  I walked into to who I think my be one of the owners, there is no signage to indicate that you order at a cash register and not sit down.  (I personally think they should reconsider this format)  He starts handing me menus and telling me specials and I don't even know what I am doing.  So we walked off and sat down at a table since no one told us to order at the cash register and the giant chalk board when you walk in  has a monthly calendar versus directions with arrows that say \"seat yourself\" and \"order this way\"    Anyway, we sit down and all and there is one other table in there right next to us.  I server is talking to them so we assumed that she would help us next.  After sitting there for 5 mins we finally figured out that we are suppose to order at the register.  I don't mind this format as long as it is done efficiently.  My only suggestion is that you make sure the customer knows what to do and put the deserts and some deli/cold items BEFORE the register, along with the jams over by the sitting area.     We order, get a number and sit down.  We ordered and split the Nosh (cheese board) and Cuban pork sandwich.  Both were very good and my only comment would be to include a jam or honey with the blue cheese.  However the sandwich was flavored perfectly and found it rather delightful.  It was delivered by a server and another girl who must be learning to be a server, they had a discussion on how to present and we had to sit there and wait to eat while we were used as training and the girl in training was clearly nervous and the girl instructing was say things like \"your going to have to learn\"  it was rather uncomfortable.  I would recommend writing down what you want to say to describe the food and straight read it.  But that's me.  Anyway, overall the food was good and if they improve the flow of the restaurant and front of the house service they will crush Arcadia.  I will be back in a couple weeks to give it another try and I am looking forward to trying their dinner with some slight spins on comfort food."}
{"text":"Great place to grab food -- not a lot of options near or in DTLV. Great if you want to cook or even if you don't. Store is really clean, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I had to yelp a lot of places because my friends and I wanted to get together for brunch and in our group we have someone who is vegan and another vegetarian and then there is us \"normal\" people lol. This place offered the best of all three worlds and we were not disappointed. The staff was incredibly nice and attentive even when there was more than one big party. We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Something sorely missing in downtown, a market. I will admit I came here a few days after it opened but I expected more.  The deli counter wasn't fully functional when I was there.  They did have a nice hot and cold food bar for a per pound rate that included some tasty looking chicken. It reminded me of the corner markets in NYC that I used to go to for lunch during work.  The prices are, as expected, higher than you would pay at most grocery stores but not outrageously so.  I am hopeful that, when they are up and running at full capacity, this rating will go up but for now, it is still A-ok in my book and a welcome addition to Fremont East."}
{"text":"What an adorable, curious place! Everything I'd heard about The Market is true + infinity! On the very corner of Arcadia's Gaslight Square is a hybrid dine-in restaurant with curbside catering. (If you're short on time prepared food is available for quick \"grab and go\".)  I popped in for a speed lunch with my Yelper friend Su-Shien and was *delighted* by the food, service and decor. Think fancy pants (chandeliers sprinkle the room) with rustic touches (cord is used to tie silverware). The space is intimate yet casual. Two top tables can readily be combined for larger groups.   I would love to return for dining IN the kitchen. That's right: There's a bigger table where the magic happens. Friends of mine have eaten there and raved about it. (Soon!)  The food is made for sharing. Nosh boards range from meat, veges, cheese, fondue and (get this) plain ole' bread and butter. My first experience was with the charcuterie (meat) board. The menu doesn't do justice to what is delivered. Delicate sides accompany prosciutto, sopprasata, bresola and spanish chorizo. Thinly sliced wafers of bread can be layered with violet mustard, apple chutney and pickled shallots. We made our selection while enviously eyeing the table next to us.  ....where The Very Jennifer was seated! She's a breath of fresh air! So sweet it (almost) hurts. You'll love her (and everyone else that works there).  My friend and I split the Roasted Pork Cuban Sandwich. The pork melted away, deliciously prepared and served on a brioch bun with a side of sea salt chips. Generously sized we were very happy with our portions  Happy Hour! *Every* Day They Are Open. (3-6pm) - 12 oz beers $2 - Well drinks $5 - Wine by glass 1/2 off   Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Grabbed brunch with a friend. Casual atmosphere, good menu prices, super friendly staff. I had coconut French toast, and while it was good it wasn't anything I'm dying to go back for.  Lots of fresh options here, great vibe, so I'll likely give it another try."}
{"text":"We love it here! Our favorite item on the menu is the  Vegetable board. It's heavenly! It isn't on their current menu after a printing error, but we have been assured it is still available, and will be on the menu when they redo them for this next season. All food is great, and they have a great wine menu also. Service can at times be a little spotty, but in my opinion, it's worth it for the quality of product and atmosphere you are receiving. It's really a hidden gem in the Arcadia area. We highly recommend making a stop in!"}
{"text":"I live very close by and was really hoping Jennifer's would be my new favorite.  Although I was sadly disappointed with the service and confused by my meal, I plan to return to try them out for breakfast.  I was sat by my waitress who came back 10-15 minutes later asking if I was ready to order, yet she hadn't given me a menu or offered me a beverage.  I ordered the herb seasoned fries (delicious! ) and the pork Cuban sandwich.  Someone else dropped off my food, and my waitress never came back. I had to flag people down as they passed to ask for things like a refill and for my tab. The \"Cuban\" resembled nothing even close to a traditional cuban sandwich.  I thought I received a bbq pork sandwich someone else ordered. It tasted mostly of vinegar (from the pickled shallots) and bbq sauce. The bun was overly charred, black and burned. They were really busy though and all new businesses experience growing pains so I will definitely be back to test out other items on their menu. There was a blond gal who I assumed was either the owner or perhaps a front of house manager that was remarkably friendly. I gave them 3 stars for now and hope to increase it after my next visit! Major plus......pet friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Hungry for dinner? Stop by grab the Spicy Pig and a Tenaya Creek on draft for $2.00...can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's such a wonderful atmosphere and they pay attention to the smallest details, like candles lined up the stairs as you enter and twine wrapped around your silverware. The service is outstanding, the ambience is a alluring, you must come and try it out as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant! The husband and I came here to get dessert and coffee one night and it was lovely. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake board.... it was so crazy good, maybe one of the best desserts I've had in Phoenix (maaaaybe). It's a delicious, dense, chocolate cake (and a large piece too!), with an espresso mascarpone topping and 3 other toppings in small containers. The toppings were raspberries macerated with mint, strawberries, and some kind of brittle. The cake with the cream and the raspberries was pure gold. I would come here just for this again. Also, the coffee was delicious and the cream came in a cute mini milk bottle (aww). The only downside was the service was a little inattentive, especially for such a small place. Anyway, I would like to come back to try their other food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch on a Sunday. When you first get there, there are two entrances so we weren't even sure which way was the correct way in. Once we were in, we stood there for about a good 10 minutes before someone even asked how they could help us. There's no sign that says seat yourself or if there's a hostess.   Once we were seated, I felt that the customer service was extremely slow and it wasn't even that busy. I ordered the Carne Adovado omelet. I also ordered a cocktail. I believe it was the Lavender Collins. My omelet was super dry. I asked for salsa with it, which I'm not sure if they had any but they brought me salsa instead.My friend also had an over easy egg that came with her meal, that came out more done then over easy.   We basically saw our waiter twice. When he seated us to take our order and when he brought our check. Which took forever to get.They also had live music while we were there. It was good, however, since the restaurant is really small, it was really loud, so I couldn't hear anything my friend said to me. I probably won't be back for the bad service or mediocre food. Maybe if they were closer I'd give them another try. But for a 45 minute drive, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and have checked out the local offerings.   This one is the clear winner.  Restaurant week choices were delicious and service was far better than another close by.  Will go again"}
{"text":"Yet another fantastic new dining establishment along the Indian School corridor!!! My company hosted a small catered event at Jennifer's new cafe and everything was fantastic!  All of our 40 guests were very happy with the food, service and overall atmosphere of the of this new cafe.   Every effort was made to ensure our party was fully accommodated.  The food was exceptional and very reasonably priced.   Jennifer and her staff are truly trying to make an impression in their new cafe and it shows.  I'm looking forward to adding this a one of my new favorite lunch spot and catering options!"}
{"text":"The food and wine was beyond excellent!  The corn bisque, tenderloin and amuse bouche were so delicious I wanted to lick the plate.  The service was also exceptional.  I would absolutely dine or have them cater an event any time!"}
{"text":"What a charming place to grab a meal!  I came here on a Friday night with my friends.  I fully expected a wait, from reading other reviews, but to my delight there was none.  We started off with the bread and butter board ($4).  It came with a few slices of bread, including a pretzel bread, a jalapeno cheese bread, and another kind.  The breads were all great and tasted freshly baked.  The butter it came with was delicious!  If only it had been a bit softer, it would have spread so nicely on the bread.  Two of my friends shared the cheese and vegetable boards for their meals.  The veggie board came with a wide variety of veggies, with bread and chips to eat them with.  It was also served with two little cups of dressing.  The cheese board had some different cheese, also with bread and chips, and on the sides little cups of dried fruit and some type of seeds (sunflower maybe?).  They seemed to enjoy them!  Although I heard the blue cheese was a bit strong.  For my entree I got the roasted chicken.  After my first bite, I knew I loved it.  The chicken was served at a great temperature - very warm!  It was so juicy - the juiciest piece of white meat I've ever had.  My only dislike was that they sprinkled some peppercorns on top and those were REALLY strong peppercorns.  I had to pick them off bc I didn't like the taste.  Also, they included a sauce on top of the dish that was a bit too salty.  Towards the end of eating the salt became a little overwhelming.  I liked the dish a lot, but if I came again I'd probably try something else bc they had lots of interesting stuff on the menu!  tip: it's kind of hard to find, located in the back corner of a little strip mall center type place. another tip is that they sell bundles of local veggies here for $25.  so you can come every Friday and pick up a box of local veggies if you want.  another tip: they serve brunch until 5 pm on the weekends, awesome for late risers (like me)!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to this part of town as a local its nice to grab some snacks on way to container park amazing desserts!!!!! love the set up !!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and amazing!  The gnocchi is my favorite, but the tuna nicoise salad and Cuban sandwich are also very good -- as are the soups.  Note: if you get the Cuban sandwich, request that they put it on plate -- it's very hard to eat on the cutting board they serve it on (the top of my bun fell on the floor, LOL)."}
{"text":"UNDERWHELMING with a capital U. Starts with the decor and layout.  Person at next table was back to back with person at our table.  It's one thing for a place to be intimate but another to be flat out cramped.  Then they have these red metal chairs that are completely uncomfortable.  They look cool but are much more form than function.  Next, we sat right by a giant flatscreen that seems out of place where it is hung on the wall and it was even weirder that they had cartoons playing on it the whole time although I only saw one child in the place, who was not even facing said TV.    The service was really really awful.  Fumbled the drink order and then took forever to finally bring drinks, so much so that most of us decided not to order a second round even though we were there for quite a while.  Server went MIA for long stretches at a time but it was not that busy on this particular night so it was just odd.  He may have driven to BevMo because the bar was also out of stock on some things.    Appetizers and salads were just nothing special.  Had a wedge salad that was uninspired.  I get less being more but there is also less being truly less.  The main entrees I will say were good but would need to be outstanding to make up for the rest of the flaws here.    Server admitted they were not on their A game that night.  Understatement of the year.  Gave us a ten percent off card which seems more like a Denny's tactic.  I threw it away.  You'll shrug and live with sucktacular service at some places but not when you're dropping $100 for two people.  This city has way too many good restaurants for us to go back.  So we won't.   I hear their catering is awesome but maybe they are working out the kinks for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice concept & alternative to comp in area. Little pricey but good. Great foodie hood."}
{"text":"Went with great expectations but was terribly disappointed. Mac & cheese was a small step up from boxed variety and crab was several days past it's pull date.  Burger was fine but a restaurant without Dijon mustard??  Very basic menu.  Won't recommend or see a reason to return."}
{"text":"I wish Jennifer's was closer to my house as I would be there all of the time!  The food is delicious , the ambiance is great - love sitting on the patio with a glass of wine and a \"nosh\" board watching the sunset - and all of the staff are very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and it was pretty tasty. Bottomless mimosas, zesty chilaquiles, fab cheese board, scrumptious butternut squash and decent posole. My only negative is how fatty the pork was in the posole. Made it hard to eat. But... very attentive and helpful service, clean and fresh space too. We loved the guitarist on the patio as well. I woukd return and try a few other items. It is that good."}
{"text":"What an adorable little place! The food is amazing!!! The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The pricing is a little high but the food is delish!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but a cute place! We asked what the chefs special was and the server said Buffalo Chicken wrap but it really ended up being some BLT wrap? Quite small but has a big table for a larger group. I liked the idea of a double concept, there is another restaurant on certain days and times of the week there as well."}
{"text":"Just. Love. This. Place. Chilaquiles are my fave for brunch AND bottomless mimosas! Absolutely adorable place!"}
{"text":"This place is first rate. Great service, great food, great drinks. Also the prices are very reasonable. A very casual place with fresh ingredients, an open kitchen you can see the cooks doing their magic and a bar where you can see the great coctails being ceeated. Not a large place and we had reservations for an early Saturday evening. Our part had their market burger, 3 meat bolognese and gnocchi. Everything was great .  We'll definately be back."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant I have been to in the valley. Stacy was awesome and so accommodating.  The bread pudding was delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh!! Service -awesome.  We even got pairing suggestions. Ambiance- relaxing.  Perfect comfort. Quality and value...ah-maze-balls!   Seriously. Get the fried balls!!! I'm overall impressed.  This is my 3rd visit.  The consistency is wonderful.  Officially my fave place to eat."}
{"text":"Super cool market on Freemont St. The place has a huge selection of groceries, snacks and beverages - -- juices, coffee, soda, beer, wine, etc.  Excellent deli inside as well; tons to choose from --- cheeses, dried meats, pastries, an awesome salad bar, fruit, etc. etc.  Tasty sandwiches too, grab & go, made to order and they're fresh and priced well below average IMO --- I had a breakfast sandwich for $4.75 and it hit the spot.   They have tables inside and outside and you check out an iPad for free and surf the web while you enjoy your chow.   Awesome to see a place like this in downtown Vegas; the entire neighborhood is up and coming and this is a great option for visitors and locals living in the hood.   If I lived in downtown I would definitely be a regular --- I love to support local businesses and this place is top notch.   I'll definitely be back!"}
