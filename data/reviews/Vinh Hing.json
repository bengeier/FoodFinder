{"text":"Best Phnom Penh soup in town.  We go at least once a week or any other chance we get. Couldn't find another spot with the same Phnom Penh as good."}
{"text":"If you live near decarie/cote vertu metro area, and are looking for some yummy or decent pho, Vinh Hing is the spot. It's close to Vanier college (great for students) and cheap too. Only 6-7$ for a bowl of pho. I would recommend the shrimp noodles or the Phnom Penh style noodles. Only complaint is the Vietnamese iced coffee which is a bit pricey (almost 4$) Expect a small menu, but quality Vietnamese noodles"}
{"text":"Ce resto existe depuis une 20aine d'années. Tout est fait sur place. La soupe phnom penh est la meilleure en ville. Goûter les boulettes de porcs....ils me rappellent ceux de ma grand-mère (et ce n'est pas peu dire!)  Endroit authentique fréquenté par principalement des asiatiques, mais qui gagne à être connu de tous!  Essayer leur pâtés chauds...délectables!"}
{"text":"We come here twice! the first time we come sometime before noon the soup is good. But the second time we come later in the afternoon, and the soup is just like water. I believed that they run out of soup and instead of telling customers to eat something else, they just added more water and MSG, even my both kids 8yrs & 9yrs complained. And another thing that I don't like to come here anymore is the strong smell as soon you get inside."}
{"text":"It's kind of a 'hole in the wall' Resto that you likely would not venture into if you didn't live in the area or have someone suggest it to you.  However, once you do try it out, you'll want to go back!  They serve a really yummy Phnom Penh that is quite rare to find in Montréal. It's basically a soup based dish consisting of a clear broth to which they add minced meat, shrimps and noodles. You can have it two ways - with the traditional pho noodles or with egg noodles and the soup on the side. Both are delicious!  Prices are decent 7-10$ depending on the bowl size. It's quite popular with the locals and older Asian folk, there's usually a wait time at lunch if you go towards 1.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the St-Laurent area and looking for some good Vietnamese food!  Beware however that the opening hours are a bit weird. Monday to Sunday (except Tuesday) - 10am to 6pm."}
{"text":"This is my go to EVERY WEEKEND. Hands down best hidden jem for bone soup full of bone marrow. Their Phnom Penh noodle is a must order, soup and bone on the side.   Also, this is a bakery and their asian fruit cake is SO FRESH. I love their spongecakes too. They're all moist and fresh."}
{"text":"The decor is authentic. The menu is small but the flavors are big. I had the dried version of Phnom Penh noodles with the broth soup aside and it was the best I've ever had in Montréal. The noodles were silky, the broth was flavorful, and the meats were plenty.  Also, the adorable lady who served us was very friendly!"}
