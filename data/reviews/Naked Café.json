{"text":"The Naked Cafe definitely deserves 5 stars. Their food is fresh, healthy, and tasty. There are no other restaurants to compare to this."}
{"text":"Very good food unique to the area. Staff are very helpful and accommodating. Prep time is appropriate for fresh, thoughtful ingredients. The staff obviously care about the quality of the food. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it and rave about it.  I gave it 4 or 5 chances and each time the customer service has been some of the worst around.  The owner hardly smiles and makes you feel like you're not good enough to be there.  I'm a raw chef and personal trainer and could have easily referred many people here but I wouldn't embarrass myself by doing so.  Too bad because the area really needs a good healthy place."}
{"text":"The service at this little cafe is incredibly poor given the size of the business.  The  lady that served me took almost 10 minutes to make the simplest of sandwiches and then couldn't remember what I had asked her to put on it.  She actually counted the pieces of tomato and put less than a piece (yes a piece, the size of a walnut) of lettuce on the sandwich.  The bread was tasty but it seemed that was all I was eating.  I would not recommend this restaurant on any level."}
{"text":"This is a vegan/ gluten free persons dream. The food was super good and the menu isn't limited based on your food exclusions. That being said, even if you don't have food allergies this place is fantastic. You can tell everything is made in house and tastes fresh. It's a meal you feel good about eating. I eat gluten free due to celiacs and my boyfriend has no eating restrictions, we both loved it. We split the gluten free chicken Caesar wrap and apple butter Brie grilled cheese, he ate the mushroom soup and we finished with the gluten free hello dolly. Everything was amazing and neither of us felt like we could tell our food was gluten free. Honestly, it was my first time there and I will be back. Side note, the two ladies working were super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The Naked Cafe is a great place in Bolton for a coffee and a bite to eat.  The food is fresh, healthy and satisfying!  Whether for a quick smoothie, yummy quinoa salad, dee-lish treat or classic old fashioned butter tart, my family makes a regular pit stop to see Svetlana and to check out her latest new culinary creations.  Worth the visit if you are interested in healthy and delicious food."}
{"text":"We stopped there last Saturday after one of my friend's recommendation. Never again.
We had a tuna salad sandwich and a turkey sandwich. We waited 20 minutes to get them (and eventually see other customers who arrived way after us get served). 7$+ tax to get a club sandwich (9$ for the turkey one). And be hungry as we're leaving... we also ordered a smoothie that was plain and watery. The Mediterranean quinoa salad was so watery it was gross. 
The only good item was the strawberry muffin. 
Thank you but no thank you. 40$ for two people to be only satisfied with a muffin. You'll never see us again and we will not recommand you."}
{"text":"Fantastic food that is healthy and nutritious. Staff are friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I love this place. The staff are very nice and the owner is a sweetheart. 

The food is healthy, delicious and prepared daily.

It's a favourite spot for breakfast and the coffee is superb."}
{"text":"Update:
Went with co-wokers again.  
Coworker ordered a turkey sandwich, and another order a turkey bacon club sandwich (gluten free bread).

Gluten free bread is $2 extra, but no discount for removing cheese, which usually is $1 extra for cheese.

It's $9.00 to $14.75 for a sandwich.
Taste is very good, but portion is so small that we finished our lunch hungry!!"}
{"text":"Excellent ingredients, but a little pricy for some things because you don't get much quantity. $0.06 to use debit ... Not much money to make from something that really annoys people and probably isn't allowed by the debit provider."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. It sure beat another crappy burger or a pizza slice. The service was slow so don't go if you are in a rush but otherwise it is well worth the wait."}
