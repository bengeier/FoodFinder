{"text":"I've eaten here seven times.

I always left disappointed.  Strangely limiting for such a large menu.  For example, there's no way to get a grilled cheese sandwich with fries, and a side salad.  You have to get the \"appetizer\" salad, which comes on a LARGE dinner plate.  The fries are clearly frozen, and the cheese from the grilled cheese is processed \"American\" cheese.

For breakfast, the cheese in the omelet is processed, and the homefries are not homemade.  The hollandaise is either from a packet or poorly-made.

Service is terrible. As if it's everyone's first day on the job.

I called once and placed a take-out order for breakfast.  The food was as good as expected, but the take-out experience was disorganized at best.  I was told to come in 15 minutes, so I came in 25 to be safe.  When I arrived, nobody seemed to know what I was talking about, then they asked me what I wanted, and had me wait in a booth for 15 minutes before they brought me my food.

Another time, an older-sounding man picked up the phone and told me that they don't do take-out.  I mentioned the large take-out sign above their door, and he said that they've NEVER done take-out.  Hm...

It reminds me of those restaurant makeover shows, where they talk about what makes a failing restaurant bad.  This restaurant seems to be a great example.  Serving poor quality, frozen, processed food, bad service, uncomfortable seating, dark, unattractive decor...
These are all easy to fix, but they don't seem to care!

It all came to a head a few weeks ago, on what would officially become the last time I EVER go to Sammy's Eatery.

My wife and I went at around 12:30 on a Saturday for Brunch/Lunch.  We were seated near the window, and started to laugh about how inattentive the servers already were!  We were given a breakfast menu, and asked the waitress if they're also serving lunch, to which she said, \"Of course!  I'll go get you a lunch menu!\"
We waited ten minutes, as she went around the area, taking other peoples' orders and delivering food, intermittently smiling at us, as if she remembered what we were waiting for.  She then disappeared for five more minutes, so I went to the bar and asked for the menus myself from the head waitress.  As my wife and I were reading the menus, two minutes later, the waitress finally reappeared with 2 copies of the menu of her own.  When she realized what I had done, she gave me a cold look, as if I had insulted her.

We placed our orders.  My wife asked for the Grilled Chicken on a Kaiser.  I asked if they had fresh prime rib that day.  She said that they always did.  You see, Sammy's has called themselves \"The Prime Rib House\".  It actually says that on their main sign outside!  \"Sammy's Eatery - The Prime Rib House\"!!  Maybe that was the problem this whole time!  I should have ordered the prime rib, as it was clearly their specialty!

The food arrived and we were both past the point of disappointment.  First of all, her fries were cold.  I tried one.  They had clearly been sitting around for at least 30 minutes.  Her chicken sandwich was less than desirable too.  Just a breast of chicken, with a melted slice of processed American cheese, on a kaiser bun.  No lettuce or tomato, no barbeque sauce or mayonnaise.  It was literally the minimum of what they could delivered.  We complained to our waitress and she blamed the kitchen, saying they didn't know what should be on the sandwich.

Here's where it went from bad to worse.  My Prime Rib was also cold.  I mean cooler than room temperature.  It wasn't cool because it was rare.  In fact, they never even asked how I wanted it (I would have asked for Medium-Rare).  It was a well-done grey throughout, and it was just plain cold.  As was the Jus that was around it.  The mashed potatoes were also cool.  I sent it back, along with my wife's fries.  It came back 5 minutes later and it was STILL room temperature.  The head waitress was sent over.  She started to blame OUR waitress for all of the issues!  I put my finger in the mashed potatoes in front of the head waitress to prove the temperature.  When touching it, I could feel that the potatoes were possibly not homemade - they were waxy like store-bought frozen mashed potatoes, rather than smooth and starchy, as fresh mashed potatoes usually are.

She continued to claim that the prime rib was made fresh that day.  I asked to speak to the manager, and was told that there was no manager there, even though I could clearly see a well-dressed older man supervising in the kitchen.  She begged us to give them another chance someday, suggesting that we should come at night if we wanted prime rib.  I reminded her about the claim made by THIER OWN SIGN.  The Prime Rib House, indeed.

So after multiple \"meh\" experiences and one unforgivably bad one, I will never return and would advise you not to waste your time, money or appetite.  Donlands Restaurant down the street serves up homemade food with attentive, friendly service."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

My husband and I JUST had \"food\" from here that we walked over in the rain, ordered and brought home. We ordered 4 meals - Fish & Chips with Roast Potatoes, Banquet Burger with Fries, Mushroom Burger with Fries and Peameal Burger with Fries. 

Where do I begin... Lets start with entering the premises at 3:30pm ish. There was 1 table with a couple of elderly women. That was all. I placed my order with the waitress that seemed uninterested in my order that she scribbled horribly onto a piece of paper. As I was ordering she walked away to take the order to the kitchen to which I yelled, \"don't I get a choice of roll or garlic bread with the fish & chips? Cause I'd like garlic bread!\" I sat at a booth waiting. She brought over the debit machine so I could pay. A few minutes later she emerged and handed me the bag of food.

Now we get home and open the food to survey. Now if you recall, I placed a 4 item order. There was only 3 containers... The fish & chips, banquet burger and mushroom burger were there, but no peameal burger. I checked the receipt, and she never even put that order through... 

Now lets asses the meals:

Fish & Chips - Took the lid off to see 2 pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw and a pickle. Yep, I said fries... Where were my roast potatoes??? One of the fish looked as if it had been dropped since it was split in the middle and had burnt black pieces in it. It was also extremely greasy and mushy. It's supposed to be Halibut but tasted like nothing. Literally, nothing... Obviously frozen. The fries, obviously frozen as well, were cold, dry and covered in grease from the fish placed on top of them. The \"garlic bread\" was wrapped seperately. I took a bite out of 1 of the 4 pieces of cold hard bread that had no garlic on it whatsoever. Not even a remote smell of garlic. I didn't eat the coleslaw as I've never been a fan. So, the best part of this meal? The pickle!

Mushroom Burger - Removed lid to see: burger, fries, coleslaw and pickle. Burger Contained: bun, 1 meat patty, processed cheddar, relish, mustard, lettuce, tomato and mushrooms. Burger meat was obviously frozen, and tasteless. There was a big glob of relish on it and the mushrooms were on 1 side only. Mushrooms seemed as though they were from a can. Bun was soggy too. Fries were cold and dry. Coleslaw was sub-par. Best part of meal? The pickle!

Banquet Burger - Also had burger, fries, coleslaw and pickle. Burger Contained: bun, relish, 1 patty, processed cheese, bacon, onion, mustard, lettuce and tomato. Same previously frozen meat with no taste. This one contained bacon though. Rubbery, salty, bacon... The saltyness over powered the rest of the burger. Fries were cold and dry as seems to be the trend. Coleslaw was not consumed. Best part of this meal? The pickle!

Peameal Burger - We'll NEVER know

So, in a nutshell, if you are really craving pickles and willing to pay $35 for them as we did, this is the place to go! Otherwise, save your money, tastebuds and disappointment that will surely ensue."}

If you want some really good home made soup come here!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid, I remember the special occasions when my mom would take us shopping.  Whether it be to Woolco (yes, I am that old), KMart (again, see last comment), Sears or Zellers, our trip out usually included lunch.  When we would go out to lunch, quite often it was to the store cafeteria, or to a local diner.  I would usually get a clubhouse sandwich with fries and gravy, or chicken fingers.  With Sammy's, I have finally found a restaurant that speaks to the call back of my child hood.

Located east of Leaside, south of Overlea, north of Danforth and west of Woodbine, Sammy's Eatery is not only a throwback of my childhood, but also a real comfort spot.  The environment in Sammy's is clean, cozy, and yet open.  They will even host special events.  Think of Sammy's as your aunt's house - she has all your favourites and hosts all the holiday dinners and family showers.

I have eaten at Sammy's once, and had orderit.ca delivery tonight.  When I went to Sammy's it was for breakfast.  Really enjoyed it.  If you like diner style breakfast, this is the spot to check out.  The crowd is mostly families, and you can tell that some of them are generational.  There is a real sense of familiarity and home about this place.  For breakfast I had pancakes, and they were great!  Service was attentive and quick and the prices are very reasonable.

Through orderit.ca I was watching Mad Men and had a huge craving for a clubhouse sandwich.  Boy, did Sammy's deliver (pun INTENDED).  No half-ass cold cuts here.  REAL turkey.  With Christmas only being a little over a week away, it was like my holiday introduction!  While placing my order, I had to go full reminiscent and have gravy and fries with my sandwich.  Huge portions, very filling, very hearty and good.  Just like you would expect from your aunt's house.

I think this will be my new brunch spot.  Easy to get to, street parking, and not insanely busy.

Perhaps I should set up a UYE...."}
{"text":"A quaint and simple family restaurant with a large menu, decent prices and all day breakfast with fast and friendly service.

I have only visited a few times but I have always been impressed by my experience, seating yourself with a large table selection to choose from and large tables themselves makes the dining experience comfortable and efficient. Friendly and prompt service with knowledgeable staff make all the difference and although I will admit I may not have gone at super busy times I have never waited long for service or for my food. 

I primarily go here for their all day breakfast but they have a very large selection of items on the menu and although I have not had the chance to try them all everything I have eaten here was excellent. Fairly large portions, especially for the price make it all the more competitive and a great value as I am always bringing left overs home for family or my dogs. 
The only real down side in my opinion is there is no parking lot, the area it is in offers many side streets with a fair bit of parking but still it is not a private lot which I prefer when eating at an establishment. 

However it is well worth the search for street parking and especially to anyone living in the area, I would highly recommend trying this cozy little gem sometime"}
{"text":"Always good for breakfast lunch or dinner. The better place for breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"Unless you are 80 or older, you probably won't be a huge fan of this place.  I've lived in the neighbourhood for a couple of years and thought I would give it a try.  

The inside is incredible dated.  I was there on a Saturday night and sat in my booth while the two servers fought over who had what table.  Their system seemed to that they would take turns taking tables as people seated themselves.  

My boyfriend and I both went for the burger for fear of what would show up at our table if we went with anything else.  Although the burger was pretty good, I can't say I will ever go back.  

Great place to take the grandparents (especially with green and purple jello on the desert menu); bad place to spend a nice dinner with anyone else you care about."}
