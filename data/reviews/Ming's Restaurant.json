{"text":"Sometime went there .... OK food .... Goos Service !! The owner (lady) very nice !!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot for HK cafe style combos and we also do group dinner (size ~10, should book in advance and they will always accommodate).  I find they make a more effort to prep the food than the average HK style restaurant.  They also have TVs broadcasting Fairchild.  Their staff is friendly and courteous.  They can do unique dishes for group dinner if you book in advance.  Go to place usually when I pickup my wife from the go station and wait out the traffic."}
{"text":"Not bad, very good value. Food quality is your typical hk cafe but slightly above average. Lots of selection all day long."}
{"text":"I usually come here for afternoon tea. My family and I come here before or after groceries since it's close to foody mart supermarket. 
It usually gets busy and full by 3:00; I recommend coming exactly at 2 or 2:10 if you want to grab a booth. 
I've noticed that if you order a slightly bigger dish like \"stir-fried black pepper beef spaghetti\" they will assume that you won't be sharing and provide only one fork and spoon. But asking for small bowls and utensils are easy and the staff are friendly.  
I've also noticed when there are a lot orders the smoke that comes from the kitchen is quite strong and since the place isn't too big, the odors spread and absorb into your clothes. I suggest if you're not a big fan of the greasy cooking fumes don't go when it's peak hours."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and large portions. 
This place is inexpensive."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and quick service. The baked fish on rice with Portuguese sauce was great."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is your typical HK café, but I must say the food's pretty good here. I usually get the Baked Tomato Pork Chop rice or the curry rice/spaghetti. Reasonably priced and service is pretty decent. Definitely recommended to those who want a quick and decent bite for a good price."}
{"text":"My family and I come here quite often. The food is pretty good, and the portions are generous and filling. The service is really prompt and friendly as well! One of my favourite 'cha chang tangs' around !"}
{"text":"Ming's is another HK café, that serves good HK style food for it's price. I usually come here if Blue Ocean Café is full since it's right next door. Not much to mention here since the menu is similar to most HK café except for their Lemongrass Pork Chop Rice (pretty much the only thing I get here). I am surprised at the quality of this dish, the pork chop is fried to until golden brown with a crispy crust, it is consistently tender and juicy, served with Vietnamese fish sauce. I can honestly say hands down it beats out many Vietnamese restaurants in the area serving the same dish.

Their cold lemon is pretty good but not the best.

Tip: They give out free \"Sing Tao\" newspaper when you order a meal there. Just ask them about it!

One thing I did notice is one our orders is always late or forgotten, on many occasions everyone would finish their meal before the my order arrives."}

{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0

I have always passed by this restaurant and finally decided to give it a try as I was craving for some baked porkchop rice and was curious about this place. Went there on a Sunday night and it was pretty empty other than a few tables occupied.

In essence, my porkchop rice was mediocre. First bite was decent but after a couple more it went downhill from there. The initial flavourful feeling was actually due to an intense amount of MSG - even the rice itself had an aroma and aftertaste of MSG. The porkchop was thick and plentiful but had too much batter on it. The frozen peas were overdone and had a weird texture - I had to pick them out from the rice.

On a good note, my iced lemon tea was good - plenty of tea flavour and not overly sweet. As well, I was surprised that I also had a choice of dessert which I ended up choosing the taro coconut milk sago - also quite decent but not enough to bring them up to a 3* as the main entree really fell short."}
{"text":"We were getting desperate for tea time food (aka, lazy man's weekend lunch) so we decided to try out this restaurant.  Our go to restaurant was closed for renos.  After a brief wait for the table, the real waiting began when we sat down.   At least 5 minutes to get served then another 15-20 minutes until we got our food and after a couple of reminders, we got our drinks.

My husband got the Super Club Sandwich - he said there was a lack of meat.  But coming from a meatarian, I feel like that would be an unfair review.   The beef brisket spicy noodles I ordered was not bad, but I didn't find it to be very filling.  The spice level was just right.  I've had better food at surrounding restaurants in the plaza.   Unfortunately, no photos....because a) I forgot my phone and b) I would have ate it all before I realized I have to take a photo #badasian.  FYI - if you want to change your drink to a cold one, expect to pay $1.25 (a bit pricier than other locations).

Looking at other Yelper's photos, I'd consider coming back for dinner.  The dinner menu looks way more interesting.  I'd probably come when there's significant less people at the restaurant and hopefully then the service will be better."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast this morning. Had the steak, eggs, sausage and hash brown. Food was ok, not too keen on the gravy, not much flavour, thick and not hot. Came with a hot drink and was only $5.99.  Not many customers here but I think I prefer New City over here. 
You can get a free chinese newspaper with your breakfast, if you can read it."}
{"text":"Lunch here is good in taste and prices. Dinner menu has a wide selection. The restaurant also takes private made-to-ordered dinner."}
{"text":"Arriving at 10:15am-ish on a Saturday morning, we needed to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. We already came here quite early because right after we got in, a ton of people flowed into the restaurant. 

Chinese newspapers are free of charge all week round as long as you dine here! Yay! If you're the type to spend money on newspaper, there you go - get it from here. I ordered from the Ming's Super Breakfast which is from 7am to 11:30am and I got letter O, which was beef in satay sauce vermicelli, scrambled egg and ham+butter and toast for $5.50. In addition to that, you get a coffee or tea for free, $0.75 extra for a cold beverage, $0.75 extra for change to instant noodles and $0.50 extra for toasted bread. 

We honestly waited like 2 minutes for our drinks to come after we ordered and like less than a minute after, the food came. The food wasn't very hot, it felt like they prepared all of this already and just scooped it from a mildly warm area, but bonus for the speed it is served at.

The beef satay didn't have enough satay in it, I feel. In addition, the soup wasn't hot, just warm. The toast, was not toasted, as you would need to pay an extra $0.50 for toasted bread...which is a little extra. The egg with ham was literally a scrambeled egg mixed with small ham slices. 

Don't expect to sit here for a really long time. The food isn't really good, but the fact that newspaper is free and food comes SUPER fast is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Fav HK diner for dinner in my books. Usually I brace myself for disappointment at HK diners because they're not known for their service or their quality of food, but this one made me question if I was dreaming. 

Service was very fast and staff are friendly. They close at 10 and we were staying because the show on their tv ends at 10. We hurried to get our bill but they were like, that's ok the show isn't over, feel free to stay. Like how nice is that! 

Dishes came promptly too, meaning that the dishes were hot when they arrived. Yay! 

Decor is... Well, let's just say this isn't a place you'd want to set a candle lit dinner. But I mean it's a HK diner so what were y'all expecting? 

OKAY SO THE FOOD. Cheap, and big portions! I love that they have enough toppings for my udon. Actually, they gave a lot and I'm so glad. Their fish in cream sauce on rice was great and very cheesy. My fav! Also, their pork and chicken chop with garlic sauce on rice qas great too. The sauce wasn't too strong. It was aromatic and delicious. 

But lemme tell you about the satay chicken udon I had. Oh my goodness. So many toppings and they had strips of green and red pepper to help complicate the taste. The noodles weren't oily. You could actually taste the gusto the chef put in when he was cooking this delectable dish in his wok. Oh my gosh. Definite 5/5.

And then! We had free dessert! It was my fav. I have to say, this is a very unique recipe of coconut sago and I love it. This coconut sago has taro chunks and egg. The egg was the truly unique bit because it actually made the dessert feel smoother and it made the whole thing more aromatic. Usually I despise taro with every fibre of my being but not today! My mom even said this may be the only time I did not puke at taro. 

My dinner was $9.50, came with a hot drink (I chose lemon water), a soup (I chose cream of veg but they also have Chinese soup), and if you're lucky, a dessert. What a deal, especially with the amount of food i got! 

If you're a skeptic of HK diners like I am, please come to this place for dinner. It will change your mind. I will definitely come back. I mean this isn't my first time here, lol."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant everytime we are in the area. The food is delicious (HK cafe style), service is good and so are the prices. I like how their daily soups aren't loaded with msg."}
{"text":"Located in the Peachtree Plaza at Kennedy road and Highway 7, Ming's is among many other restaurant's competing for food turf!
Coming here just after 9:30 this place is bustling with early birds taking advantage of their breakfast set specials called 'Mings Super Breakfast'.
Though this place isn't the fanciest, people come here for their food which is reasonably priced.
Being hungry in the morning, I decided to try their steak and eggs which is served with hash brown and sausage.  Portion-wise and for the cost, it's definitely worth it.  In addition all set meals (usually, unless specified) come with their hot milk tea (aka HK tea).
As an FYI they only serve cash here. 
Aside from breakfast they have a lot of food options in their set menu section ranging from $7 and up, which is very affordable.

Overall great place! I'll be sure to stop off sometime for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. They have free wifi! We got the Lemongrass Pork with Noodle soup, Baked Chicken On Rice with Tomato Sauce, Beef Brisket on Rice and Assorted Seafood and Mushroom Soup with Puff Pastry and Garlic Bread. 

Their items are quite pricey at $8.99 for Beef Brisket on Rice, and another $1.00 extra for a cold drink, but it comes with your choice of Cream Soup or Borscht. Both soups were okay, nothing special. 
The Baked Chicken on the Rice tasted funky and did not taste pleasant at all. The Lemongrass Pork was pretty good and flavourful. The HK Milk tea was pretty bland and had no significant tea flavour and was highly diluted by the large amount of ice they had put in it.

Everyone had gotten their dishes except for me, who ordered the Puff Pastry Soup. I know it requires time to make, and after 30 mins we asked the waitress about it. She said it takes time, and so we waited another 20 minutes, with everyone finishing up their meals and drinks, and still nothing. We inquired once more, and she went into the kitchen to check which took another 10 minutes and she came out saying the kitchen forgot our order. We decided to cancel it as we didn't want to wait any longer and everyone had finished their food. At that time I was quite disappointed and a bit frustrated, but mistakes happen and they did apologize.  I still would not return however, especially after reading that forgetting orders are a common thing here. 

There are plenty of other options nearby in the plaza."}
{"text":"Free wifi! 9053050770. Great and friendly service. Get the specialty puff pastry soup combo. Orgasmic garlic bread!!

They're not as cheap as your average Chinese Hong Kong style cafe but the few extra dollars you pay is so worth it!! All of their pork chop rice dishes are to die for

They have daily specials from 1130am-10pm and afternoon tea sets from 2pm-6pm, lunch specials from 1130am-6pm"}
{"text":"All the restaurant are full in this plaza but not this one. So why not give it a try. Service is very quick. The food a pretty good but nothing really excite me. I don't mind coming here again but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I come here to eat all the time on different occasions and this is my favourite hk style restaurant! I recommend this place for Markham; the food is delicious and for an affordable place. I normally get the club sandwich for lunch and its very good as I don't see those sandwiches in many places anymore. A must-try is the sizzling steak plates along with the Milk tea. 

The service is very fast and the staff are friendly as well. The cafe really gives a hk vibe and has lots of choices for food. The parking here is easy to find as there are some right beside the place."}
{"text":"It is really 3.5 stars.

This is a HK style cafe that has a traditional-HK-style-cafe decoration, as opposed to contemporary new age.  I have grown to like this decoration style; it is homey and unpretentious.  

I ordered a stirred fried noodle ($7) for lunch.  It tasted decent/okay/not bad.  In short, it won't wow you but you won't hate it for sure.  But the portion will wow you.  Hugh portion - 2 meals in 1, or 2 ladies can share 1 order, or 1 guy can get really full.

The services was super friendly and efficient.  The waitresses actually smiled there.  +0.5 star for enthusiastic service attitude."}
{"text":"Ming's Restaurant is a HK cafe similar to New City Restaurant, Phoenix Restaurant, Richmond Court, etc.  

Today I had the Gui Lin Vermicelli in Soup for $6.99.  It's an all day Chef's Special and comes with a drink (I got hot lemon tea).  It was pretty good.  The rice noodles were a bit on the soft side though.

Overall I enjoyed this place and will come back to try other dishes.  Lots of items on the menus.  Staff was very friendly chatting with patrons, free wifi, good location with decent parking."}
{"text":"Got here at around 11:45am and missed the morning specials but everything here is pretty reasonably priced so not much difference anyway.

Instant noodle with satay beef and scrambled egg sandwich $6.50 - good amount of beef which was soft and tender. The egg sandwich was a bit dry. Usually its dripping in butter but its almost like they forgot to put butter in this one. Still tasted good though.

Smoked salmon toast with fusilli in vegetable soup $5.99 - pretty average dish. The smoked salmon tasted okay but they litterally just threw it on the plate with the toast. Looked weird like the plate was incomplete.

Curry beef brisket with rice $8.50 - Tasted okay and the beef was pretty soft and tender.

All meals came with milk tea. 

Good for cheap, fast meals"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! 4 for their friendly service, 3 for their food. Everything is reasonably priced and portioned. Food tasted pretty good though not spectacular.  

I ordered take out today. We had the Hk style baked pork chop rice and baked meat sauce spaghetti. They were far from gourmet but brought back childhood memories. A set lunch also came with soup and a drink for under $20 including tax. 

Most Hk style restaurants are not the best in service, but not this one. I've had nothing but praise for them each time I visited.  Today I decided to ask how the pork chop was fried- is it battered? The lady who took my order became giddy and asked a more senior staff to come on the phone to answer my question. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"3.5

Another HK style restaurant to add to my list.  Ming's is your typical HK style restaurant, nothing more, nothing less.

Pros:
Ample seating for a small place
Prices are good

Cons:
Portions on some items could be better

We came in for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  It was about 1000 and the place was already full.  For a small place, there's about 12 booths and a bunch of tables in the middle.  Turnover is real quick and we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  For all those seats in a small place, it doesn't have that cramped feeling you get at other small HK style cafes.  

We ordered a couple of breakfast specials.  I had a beef brisket noodle soup and a egg and ham sandwich to share with my little one.  My GF had the breakfast special which came with eggs, sausage (hot dogs), ham and toast.  Each special comes with a hot drink and you pay a little more for a cold one.  The food comes out very quick.  My noodle was very good.  It could of used a little more brisket but they gave you oodles of noodles.  The rice noodle they used was to my liking as well.  It stayed consistently al dente throughout the meal.  The sandwich was more of a miss.  The bread was rather thick, but there wasn't much inside.  It was literally one egg and a slice of ham.  For $3.99 they could of at last given me two eggs. My GF's breakfast special was not bad.  Her toast was different from the bread I got for my sandwich if anything to note.

Service here is on par with other places.  There's no glaring flaws of any sort to report.  We didn't need the third drink for our specials because our little one didn't need one so they gladly gave us a discount on one of the specials to make up for it.  Breakfast came out to just under $18 before tips.  

We had a good experience here and we'll definitely be back to try their non breakfast offerings when we can."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Good food and cheap. Ordered the congee with preserved egg & salted meat with bean sprout chow mien, comes with cofee or hk tea, only $5.99. Also had beef brisket tuce noodle soup with hk tea at $6.50. Both are really good. I like the way beef brisket were made, very tasty and soft.

Lots of chouces for lunch and dinner menu. Will come back and try it out."}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow. I ordered 3 dishes with my friends and the first one came after being seated for an hour. The dishes also came 45 minutes apart, so no one even ate at the same  time! The wait staff was extremely unhelpful and unfriendly. They stood  in the corner talking instead of doing anything productive. Needless we were all extremely unsatisfied and will not be back soon. I would give it lower than 1star if possible."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast! From 7-11:30 AM they feature a breakfast menu. Ordered beef brisket rice noodle ($6.50) and oatmeal with egg sandwich ($5.99). It's a sweet little Hong Kong style cafe with the standard menu items and an HK tea or coffee that comes with the entree.

The beef brisket was quite good. Satisfying and met expectations adequately. The oatmeal is very milky - exactly how I love to eat it. HK milk tea is perfectly strong and flavored.

Nothing notable about the service. Common to most cafes of this style, the news is on in the background. Its also located at Kennedy/Hwy 7 plaza - can be packed depending on time of day."}
{"text":"wow. what a place for a us based Hong Kong chinese. food is excellent, just like I was in ??. it a must if you have been starving for authentic???food.too bad I wolfed down my  ???? already  so can't show you."}
{"text":"There are a lot of this type of restaurant in this plaza. Comparing the others to Ming's, it is quite a disappointment. I come to this restaurant for tea time at least once a week that is until last month. I got the instant noodle with beef and a cold lemon tea. I believe she is the owner of the place had the usual poor customer service and the food quality started to go downhill. Their food menu has been the same since they have opened. This is a restaurant that does not follow the trend."}
{"text":"What's happened with this place? I thought I went into a funeral home instead of a restaurant! Can they make customers feel more welcome and wanting to return with better manner and service? How about a little  smile, instead of the annoyed and impatient look?

Definitely done with this place, they don't deserve our business!
And price is not cheap either!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom today for afternoon dining.
I will never come back here again. Why?

The service is terrible. (Attached photo of rude waitress)
The food was edible, but very watery.
The drinks are good.

Be cautious when visiting here for a try.
I am not going to write much for this review, because it was simply that terrible."}
{"text":"Ming's Restaurant is another Hong Kong Style Cafe in the Chinese plaza at Kennedy and Hwy 7.

Good thing about it is open at 7 AM for breakfast 7 days a week! OK who's in their right mind will be up at 7 AM on weekends if one doesn't need to work? I don't know.. :P

Breakfast starts at $2.50 with a sandwich and a drink.. which is A-OK for me!

Nothing great but nothing bad, that's how we like our cheap quick breakfasts to be.. and I able even pick up the bill and treat my friend!

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Ming's Restaurant because of its location and efficiency in serving food.

I can only speak for their breakfast menu since I come for breakfast only, but I usually order the \"Lai Wan\" style congee with \"Fried Turnip Cake\" or \"Vermecelli noodles\". The congee is a heaping portion for one person (around 2 1/2 bowls worth). The turnip cake is a hit or miss at times and the vermecelli is what you can expect of fried vermecelli with egg. 

From their menu, you can either choose a congee (eg. LaI Wan, Pork Liver, Fermented Egg) plus a side dish (eg. Fried Turnip Cake, Vermecelli noodles, Chinese Fried Dough) for around 5$. Other combos on the menu include western style dishes (Eggs with ham/sausage plus pasta that comes with a drink) for around the same price. 

The food itself won't be pleasing to the eye if you're used to upper scale restaurants, but for the price and speed at which you get your food, it can be overlooked. 

The environment itself is very noisy. It's a typical chinese fast food restaurant where it is expected that once you're done your food, you pay the bill and leave. Quick and efficient. 

Overall, My family and I come back to this restaurant because we are the type of people that just want our meal and want to head out shortly after. It's a good quick stop place. It's not somewhere to go if you want to sit around and catch up with friends. 

Not bad! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! This is my go to Chinese place! I love the new decoration and the service is amazing! The price is definitely worth it considering the large portion of food they provide! The owner is really nice :)"}
