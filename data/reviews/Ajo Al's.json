{"text":"Disappointed in our meal. The Chimichanga was not fried, just oil soaked tortilla covered with canned enchilada sauce. The salsa for the chips was fermented. It tingled on the tongue. Far overpriced for not so good quality."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices! Our waitress was very generous and attentive- As someone with special dietary concerns, they were a breath of fresh air. On top of that, things were clean, and the fun Mexican theme really created a nice atmosphere. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Ajo Als for over 15 years- I love the food but we ordered take out this week twice and BOTH times they got our order wrong. When I called to place the order the gal that answered the phone was laughing and giggling and not paying attention. She didn't even know they had the \"papa jack flautas\" that I was ordering. Finally We had to go back to get the correct order and they offered no compensation and barely an apology. I hope they get their customer service together-it's so disappointing since this is our go-to spot for Mexican food on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Really good salads!  Salsa is yummy and enchilada sauce is fantastic!  Service is ok but food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Second time I have come in this place mid afternoon both times on Sunday's and have walked right out because I receive no service at all. Literally. Walk into the bar and sit down. No bartender?Ask for a table from employees sitting down in booths. Get sat finally, no server anywhere to take my order? Need some serious help in this place. Probably start at the top."}
{"text":"I previously lived in Phoenix area for ten years and still come back regularly for work.  Ajo's is a must stop for me at least once during each of my visits back to the valley.  Taco salad and fajitas are phenomenal.  Top shelf margaritas are the best in town."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is a great place to go for authentic Mexican food. Nothing terrible, nothing amazing, but a good middle of the road restaurant with a good environment and good food. Highly recommend the jalapeño bean dip, it is the best around."}
{"text":"Every trip to Phoenix, we find ourselves at Ajo Al's. It's got somewhat of a nostalgia factor for my husband. In light of this, be forewarned that my rating might be inflated.  I always get the flauta dinner -chicken is better than beef, for sure- they are juicy and stuffed (no meat skimping here!) and well flavored. Beans and rice are pretty good too.  My biggest complaint would be in regards to the drink selection. Margaritas are plentiful and varied, but if you're not a tequila person (I'm not) you're pretty much  stuck with soda or beer. Eh. Wish they'd make mojitos or horchata or something.  Service is mediocre but usually not lacking, decor is a little random - don't come here if you want something \"classy;\" but with the right expectations and some fond memories, this place delivers."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Great food, ambience, and service! Best dishes: pollo con queso, pollo blanco enchiladas, and the jalapeño bean dip. Also can't forget about the Horchata drink and the fried ice cream. Overall, would totally recommend this lovely family-owned restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food on the valley.  Delicious chips and salsa, margaritas, and great food portions.  I have been coming here since 2000."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is its atmosphere and Mexican themed decor - a very nice setting that people seem to comment on.  The worst thing about this place is all the food. The easiest thing to get right at a Mexican restaurant are the chips and salsa, but the ones offered here taste brought-in, stale and oily. The salsa tastes like it comes straight from the can with no additional ingredients or any fresh tomatoes.  We've dined here several times and have tried many different dishes but none of them are up to scratch. One member of our family LOVES Ajo Al's and is a regular, so she always enjoys her meals here."}
{"text":"Strong choice for solid Mexican food in NE scottsdale  Food is awesome   Restaurant is well lit.  Almost too well lit  Bar area seems a little run down and needs some updating.   There is a very small patio up front with half a dozen tables. I prefer the fajitas and the burros.   Salsa chips are different as the salsa is presented in a small container.  Not easy for sharing or dipping       We get take out alot from ajo al"}
{"text":"This resaurant has consistently gone down hill for the last 5 years. I have been going here since the granding opening when I was 10 years old. It was always the best around. Not quite sure what has happened maybe their chef got deported?? Food is not the same!!! Bring your real chef back PLEASE!! Also the menu prices have gone up and up and up. Worse food higher cost Not a recipe for success"}
{"text":"2 stars is a stretch but the staff was nice. Started out with dirty plates (hardened old food) from being poorly washed. I ordered a chicken chimichanga and there were literally chunks of aluminum foil INSIDE that were noticed on the first piece that was cut off. Sent the food back and more food came back luke warm and the plate was unbearably hot. Won't be back. Would rather eat at Taco Bell...."}
{"text":"Great food (nachos with shredded beef), nice staff, especially Becca and Tatiana!! If you are a foodie you will love this place. Everything from scratch, the best Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We ordered the pizza type appetizer (I can't remember it's name) and it was delicious but so big that we just took our entrees home.  Too much for 2!  I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's offers relatively expedient service (90% of the time at least) with slightly above average mexican cuisine. The food is more of a Gringo style mexican cuisine not the Sonoran style \"border slop\" that my wife prefers but it is reliably good. The staff is friendly, the environment is tastefully well decorated, and the service is good 90% of the time."}
{"text":"The food at Ajo Al's is decent and very Americanized.  For those of you who are seeking authentic Mexican food this is certainly not the place.  I have eaten at this location many times over the better part of the past decade, and unfortunately I believe that the quality of the food has been in a gradual decline.  When I started coming here the portions were huge and the quality was consistently good.  More recently the portions have been smaller and the dishes have been less consistent.  In particular, I am a creature of habit so I usually get the chicken enchiladas.  Previously, the chicken enchiladas would have been dominating the plate with their overwhelming size and juicy meat.  More recently the chicken has been dry and the plate has been taken over by the rice and beans.      The AYCE chips and salsa are a nice touch, but I would prefer paying a little bit more for slightly larger portions and better-cooked food than getting copious portions of chips."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Great ambience. Friendly, helpful staff. Great portion size especially for the price. Good for cheese lovers. Hard not to ruin my appetite by eating so many delicious tortilla chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Had the carnitas street tacos, which were very good. The salsa was also good, a little bit of a kick compared to other restaurants' house salsa. Families and groups would be fine here I think. Would definitely recommend and will try to stop the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has so much history in my family because we never seem to find a place that compares. The fajitas are to die for and so is their signature Pollo con Queso. We always finish with their sopapillas; they've continuously been the best ones I've ever had in my life. Wonderful, authentic, satisfying Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have an addiction to Jalapeno Cream Cheese.  There, I admitted it!  I am not sure what it is about this sinful substance, but it keeps drawing me back in again and again.  I have to say that Ajo Al's version is one of the best out there.  I usually get the Beef Flautas with the cream cheese and a side of beans.  It is even tastier to mix some of the cream cheese with the beans!  The pollo fundido is also excellent, of course, it too has the cream cheese!  They do a good job on the classics as well, enchiladas, tacos and I love their salsa too!  Overall, a quality place serving Sonoran style favorites."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is a great family Mexican joint!  I usually get the chicken fajitas or the spinach enchiladas! Both are great."}
{"text":"Out for family night, the three hostess's were extremely pleasant and we were seated immediately. Once seated a buser dropped of chips and salsa(which we never saw him again) unfortunately the chips were cold. Strangely for a Saturday night the restraunt was pretty empty, we received a new bowl of chips and promptly ordered our daughters food with the drinks, then ordered our food as well afterwards. Food at best was mediocre and cold, unexpectedly the service was extremely slow for a slow night.... unfortunately was up tossing and turning all night from the food I did eat. Expected more from the service and the food to be better for a $50 bill....."}
{"text":"We have been going to Ajo Al's for 10 years. We have always been satisfied with the food, but not today. I usually order either a chicken tostada or a chicken and bean tostada or a bean tostada. Today, I ordered the bean tostado and it was smaller than its ever been. I didn't say anything, but more than likely wouldn't order it again. It seems to be a trend with restaurants right now to reduce their serving sizes. Well, guess what, I won't be frequenting the ones who do. We ordered two cadillac margaritas at $8 apiece. You would think the least we could have expected would have been decent size portions of food. Our total bill was $39 plus tip. No way, Jose. So, if you're looking for an appetizer, the bean tostada is a good choice. If you're looking for a lunch size portion, the bean tostada is not it. Hey, Al, feel free to comment."}
{"text":"I literally love this resteraunt! I could live off of the pollo con queso! Its so yummy. The service is always great too! I think everyone should give this place a try, I doubt you will be dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"Love the enchiladas here! Service is hit or miss. Try the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's needs a face lift; the place is falling apart. Ripped carpet, dirty bathrooms, no toilet seat covers for women! and constant dripping sink. Servers are really good, polite and kind. Chips taste like cardboard, soak them in salsa. Food is marginal."}
{"text":"great Mexican food overall. nice family environment. prices are reasonable as well. i definite must try if you have never been!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. My friends and family dine here about every other week, and we refer to the restaurant as \"The Place of Friendship\" for our happy memories shared at this location. While there are three Ajo Al's locations in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area, we always go to the 90th Street and Via Linda location across the street from the Fry's Marketplace.   *Please note: I am not a fan of spicy food, so everything I order is very mild. However, other members of our usual group do venture to try the spicy side, and they love everything here as much as I do.  You start at your table with a full pitcher of ice cold water, fresh tortilla chips, and a bottle of delicious salsa. My group of friends always starts the meal with a pitcher of the house margarita, frozen to a delicious slush! While these frozen margaritas don't taste super strong, they sneak up on you! (I always cut myself off after a third 8 ounce glass) My usual order is one of the combination meals: One cheese enchilada with red sauce, one shredded chicken taco, and one shredded beef tamale, which comes with a side of rice and beans. I always underestimate the size of this meal, and I usually only finish half of each item on my plate, but this makes for great left overs! I'll start with the cheese enchilada: delicious cheddar cheese on the inside and on top, with a smooth and mild enchilada sauce. The tortilla is always fresh and soft, the cheese is always melted perfectly, and the enchilada sauce never has any chunks of tomato or spices.  The shredded chicken taco is pretty standard: shredded chicken, lettuce, diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese on top. While I do like the gentle flavors of the chicken taco, I might advise others to add a bit of hot sauce or salsa to this taco. Altogether, this taco is great and quite filling.   The shredded beef tamale is moist, flavorful, and a little spicy! The second you peel back the outer corn husk, the steam and smell from the inside of the tamale quickly escape, making your mouth water. The shredded beef is seasoned with spices, and is cooked to tender perfection. The cool taste of the corn tamale pairs so well with the spicy beef, always creating an enjoyable bite. The Spanish rice and refried beans are served with most meals, making a great go-to for when your mouth is hot and the margarita pitcher is empty.   The prices at Ajo Al's are one of my favorite characteristics of this restaurant. My meal (food only) is only $13, and as I said before I never finish my meal because of the large amount of food. We usually eat here on Monday's, when there is an all-day happy hour special and the large margaritas are only $4! There are lots of other happy hour deals for drinks and food items. This place definitely gives you a bang for your buck.   The atmosphere is very casual, welcoming, and homey at Ajo Al's. The casual attire makes it a very versatile choice for a variety of occasions. We have come to Ajo Al's after the gym looking and smelling terrible, (I wouldn't recommend doing that) we have come dressed up for date night, and we have come in basic casual jeans with no specific occasion in mind.  The atmosphere reflects the casual attire, and the décor, lighting, and music in the restaurant is very welcoming and relaxed.   The service at Ajo Al's is remarkable, and is the primary reason why we keep coming back to this same location. Somehow we keep getting the same waitress, and by now she recognizes our group, pretty much knows our orders, and appreciates our silliness. While I don't know her name, she is super friendly, takes the best care of our party, and has a great sense of humor, which goes a long way with our group. We even joke and tell her that in 50 years when we're old and still coming to the same restaurant week after week, we want her to still be our server! Of course we want her to pursue a career further than this, but in theory we would love to continue seeing her at our beloved Ajo Al's."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting and this place was great. They give you chips and salsa to start. Both were good. I tried the Steak Burro Enchilada Style and it was delicious. The lunch special as about $9 and it came with rice and beans. I was impressed with the meal so I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not very good. Stale chips, salsa was OK chimichanga was a meat loaf wrapped in a tortilla. Tostada was not good. Enchilada not good so that's three different meals the different people having a bad experience. Also my red sauce on the chimichanga was more like Mole sauce. Just a plain bad dinner experience. I hardly ever write reviews but I had to on this one I love Mexican food but I couldn't even finish my meal nothing positive about this experience should get my money back. Sorry Ajo Al's"}
{"text":"Always a mainstay whenever we can't decide whether to go into downtown Phx or stay in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is lovely and the food is always good. They are open most nights until 10, which is great if one of us is stuck at work late. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful experience with my family! Fun atmosphere and great staff! We were instantly greeted by our server who had the best recommendations! Awesome food, awesome service, awesome restaurant! Definitely cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have always liked Ajo Al's - casual atmosphere, ok food, convenient for us. Last night we went for dinner & margaritas. Our pitcher of margaritas came, and I noticed what I thought was a very oddly cut lemon under the ice cubes. No, it was a receipt, a paper, cash register receipt. I brought the pitcher to our waitress, who was quite surprised, and apologized. She brought us another pitcher and let us know that the receipt was from last week. When she brought us our check after our meal, we fully expected the margaritas to be comped or discounted. Nope. We told the server to go ask her manager to do better. She came back with a story that they can't discount/comp liquor, but they would put our name in their \"book\", and we'd be able to collect a complimentary appetizer next time. There will never be a next time for us."}
{"text":"Always a consistently good experience. The food taste great, it's a pretty good value, and the staff is friendly. Sure it's not authentic, but is definitely very good, and odds are you will enjoy it too.  We enjoy the fajitas, and I also like the Pollo fundido.  The kids are fans of the quesadilla, and the taquitos. Our littlest one love's, and I mean absolutely loves the cheese crisp.  Mmmm"}
{"text":"We have been there twice at two different stores. Both outstanding. We had three dishes. Chicken tacos for which my grandson enjoyed.   My wife and I shared two dishes Spinach enchiladas and the Chicken Picado dinner. We first ate the enchilada. It was fantastic, tasty is an understatement. It was very rich as a result we could not eat anything from the chicken picado  entree. I did eat a few pieces of chicken again very tasty   I have only one complaint the chips were too oily. The dip was very good."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Scottsdale in the spring of 1990, my cousin took me to this Aho Al's, and I have been hooked ever since.  Every time I come back to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I make it part of my ritual to find the closest Aho Al's to partake of their delicious cuisine.  Is it authentic Mexican food?  Probably not.  But my wife grew up in southern Colorado and she swears the green chili relleno here is as good as it gets.  Even though we have a fairly decent sized Hispanic population in the Kansas City area, so far none of the so-called Mexican restaurants that we have tried have measured up.  I normally get a chicken chimichanga, but this time I opted for seafood enchiladas with shrimp.   I was not disappointed.  For my wife, the green chili relleno - and on this trip, no heart-burn after the fact.  She loved it, as always.  One thing that can often be overlooked and understated are the free corn tortilla chips they serve you after you are seated at your table.  Their salsa is okay, but their tortilla chips are the best restaurant chips I have ever had, period.  I have to watch myself so as not to ruin my appetite by gorging on the chips before my meal arrives.    Service was great, as usual.  Prices are reasonable.  Overall, this trip, as all the others, was excellent.  Needless to say, next time we come to the area, we'll be checking out Aho Al's again, whatever the location."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is just OK, its nothing fancy or different from any other mexican restaurant. The Queso dip is AMAZING, The Chiicken pollo con queso is pretty good, be warned though, it is overly stuffed with dried chicken, and some of the chicken is basically a HUGE SLAB OF CHICKEN.   It's a bit of a busy place, so be prepared to hear everyone's conversation thats within hearing range.   Servers are friendly, and you are served with water, chips and salsa within seconds of being seated. Just don't get a seat close to the bathroom, in the bar, or close to the front door. EVERYONE will be in your face."}
{"text":"Food was great!  We went back a few more times since November.  I'm very glad Al's fixed the issues that they were having and went back to very good food again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Tried reaching manager/ owner son multiple times and was ignored that is the reason for the review. If you have young kids this is not a good place to go service is incredibly slow."}
{"text":"What a delicious Mexican meal I had! Mini chimis pollo style is the bomb dot com. And our server Nikki gave us excellent service. She was so kind, attentive, funny and gorgeous! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is super busy at lunch times and it took us 1 hour to get our order. However the quality and taste of the food is as every Mexican restaurant. But the portions they serve is worth for wat we pay."}
{"text":"One of my favorite mexican restaurants. I love the Tacos Miranda!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested that Ajo Al's was the best Mexican restaurant he had been to in Scottsdale. I'd say he's right! Really enjoyed the flavors and the service and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times over the years. Always enjoyed the food (try the poco pollo con queso!) service can be a little spotty at times."}
{"text":"We finally stopped eating there Not because of the food but the service is terrible. We were seated and waited 15 minutes, they brought in other couples and waited on them. We finally got up and left. We have been going there for a long time. You never see a manager there."}
{"text":"Had the takeout as it was comped from a previous BAD Order... gave us the smallest salsa and hot sauce for the Pizza and an Enchilada. . .they just can't get 2 orders wrong.. but they do!! Service Sucks~!! and so does the Management~!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy Mexican food, this place is not for you. Took my 90 year old mother here, and she also found the food bland and lacking in flavor. Haven't been to this place in years, and now I remember why. Only reason for 2 stars is that the service was fast and the margaritas, though not particularly good, were strong. They do not skimp on the tequila. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Scottsdale. Everything on the menu is amazing. Love the cheese crisp and the specials are just that, special. The decor could use some updating. I have been going here for 25 years and it still looks the same.   Tip: Mix the salsas together hot and mild. You have to ask for the hot though :)"}
{"text":"Am I the only person who sees \"Ajo Al's\" and thinks \"A-hole Al's\"? Anyway, went here for lunch.  The service was very good.  I think the chips./salsa hit the table before my butt hit the seat.  Well done.  I ordered the chicken enchilada/chicken taco combo. It comes with rice and refried beans.  My wife had something called Chuy's Chimi which is a chimichanga served with beans and rice (I have no idea who Chuy is).  The food was OK.  It wasn't great. I ate the enchilada first and thought that nothing could be blander than this. Then I bit into the taco.  I dumped some salsa on it and that helped. $30 plus tip for two meals and drinks.  Not bad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the dinner meal here last Saturday.  Went to dinner with my wife and son.  I order the a taco, relleno and tamale, my wife got the fish tacos and my son the chimi.  The taco was OK, but the relleno was basically a chile with a lump of cheese on top and grease was pouring out of the tamale.  My wife's fish taco was so dry it tasted like it was cooked 6 hours earlier.  The refried beans were dry and burst along with the rice.  My son said the chimi was good.  Not a good experience, will never go back.  We've been getting take out at Carolina's lately.  The food is simple and good.  It's quite a drive but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I really enjoyed the cheese crisp, the hard shell tacos and the green chili tamales. The fried ice cream is to die for..... Literally."}
{"text":"Every time I have visited Ajo Al's (any location) my food has been served up with at least one hair in it. I don't get it?! Do they have a salon in the back? Perhaps the staff gets ready when they arrive to work?   Anyhow, hair aside, I actually like the food here. The beans are delish, rice cooked well, chips crisp and salsa fresh.   I also have great service every time. I like the bar at this particular location, too. The bartenders have always been friendly and it's awesome for people watching while patrons wait outside the front doors for a table. (Take note: yes, we can see you from the bar, but it's hard to see in).   If they invested in hairnets this place would be a little more than \"a-okay\"!   So keep an eye out for strays and if you manage to get your food sans the extra protein, you will certainly enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place and all the food is excellent. Great happy hour too. $2-3 tacos and $2 corona draft. Salsa is amazing. I've been going here for at least 20 years. It gets very busy at dinnertime so go early if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"A childhood favorite, the food is is a little expensive but the atmosphere, the quality of the food, and the friendly service I enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a large group lunch here, the staff were great in a hectic time but overall the food was just serviceable. The other location in Scottsdale seems to have better chefs as it's impressed me more both times I've compared.  It's not great, it's not bad, it's... Serviceable"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's on 90th Street has been our choice for Mexican food for years.   We've never had a bad or mediocre meal there and have tried a lot of different items from the menu.  Staff is friendly and all do a great job.  For those who think the food should be spicier, that can be arranged simply by requesting it.  I have trouble with really spicy food, so appreciate that a lot of the dishes have some heat, but nothing overpowering.  My husband, on the other hand, often asks that something be prepared \"muy picante\" and they are happy to oblige.  Seems silly to complain about something they are so willing to adjust to suit the customers' tastes."}
{"text":"Stopped by Ajo Al's with family while visiting them in Scottsdale.  Convenient location right off the 101 freeway.  Small parking lot.  Seating was prompt at dinner time and we had a great server who really stayed on top of things.  Atmosphere was casual, but a little dated and the main room was a bit noisy.  We did enjoy the various masks and southwestern appointments around the room.  Food was \"par for the course\"...  very average and essentially what you get from most other Mexican food restaurants throughout the valley.  Margaritas tasted nice and fresh.  Jalapeno Bean Dip was like a bowl of melted cheese with beans thrown in for color, but still tasted \"ok\".  Only complaint would be that my \"Chimichanga\", which is essentially a deep-fried burrito, came out way undercooked and the tortilla was exceptionally doughy.  Apart from that, the rest of the food was spot-on, the portions were big and Ajo Al's proved to be a good, although very average Mexican food joint.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  If you're in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place as we haven coming here for years. Food is still pretty good and the service is okay, but don't expect to get your food in a timely manner. We arrived here a little before 7PM, did our time and waited for about 20mins to be seated. I expected that, but it's a little under an hour and we still have not gotten our food. Meanwhile two other table that have been seated after us received theirs. My wife was kind enough and asked someone what the hold up was and they said it would be right out. Fast forward another 15 minutes and...Still no food. Have to say after being a Custer for a more than a decade I would not recommend this place if you have a family with young kids or if you plans that are there me sensitive."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. A gringo wonderland. I have lost my license and needed a dinner spot close enough to my hotel that I wouldn't run the risk of getting pulled over (i'm a hysterical driver...watch out Phoenix) and Ajo Al's reviews were pretty decent so I headed down to get some fish tacos.   I was scared about anything saying \"Del Mar\" after my Frank & Lupe's experience but though the Hawaiian Ono in the Tacos del mar ($11.95) was previously frozen, it was an enjoyable experience. I've never had Ono and to me the texture was like that of swordfish, which is just fine for a tiny soft taco. It was a little chewy, but again that's because it's frozen. The beans and rice were okay, and there was some sauce for the tacos that was okay too...not exciting enough for me to remember what the sauce was though, or what it tasted like.   When seated you will be presented with the world's largest basket of ultra thin tortilla chips you've ever seen, whether you are one person or 6. They were a little greasier than i prefer BUT they were warm and that makes them yummier.   I don't think I would go back here but I don't regret trying it. It was a good meal and the servers are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Not great salsa and not a lot of options for the vegetarian. Oh well, ok place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Call ahead. This place is so busy during lunch, you'll never make it during a regular lunch hour if you don't!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this Ajo Al's since 1993 when we first moved to Arizona.  We have seen staff members come and go but they have maintained very good consistency with service and quality of food.  We have been to other Ajo Al's in the valley but this one is our favorite and it's close to home. We have experienced different service and even slightly different tasting food (good or bad) from each of them so please consider where you are eating.  My family teases me because I get the very same thing every time we go.  Ground beef burrito with rice and beans added inside the burrito with two sides of shredded cheese and one side of sour cream.  I cover the burrito in the mild salsa too. They say it should be a regular on the menu...\"Bill's Burrito\".  You have to try the Queso dip.  Hot, cheesy and very good!  My family assures me everything else is great!  Machacha Chimi and Pappa Jack enchiladas are very good according to them.  At this location, get there a little early on Friday and Saturday nights or there will be a short wait for a table.  Weeknights are okay anytime.  We take all our visiting, out of town friends to Ajo Al's to enjoy good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Mexican foodie and have been trying Mexican restaurants all over Scottsdale, Tempe and the Phoenix area since I moved down here.  I usually start by talking about the food but holy cow, my server and service was hands down he best I have ever had and deserves notice first and foremost.    I never asked her for her name but got the bill later and it said my server's name was Mercedes so I hope this is the right name.  This girl put a smile on every table I watched her go to every single time including mine.  She was always at each table, at exactly the right time, with what the customer wanted.  Her consolidation skills were off the hook amazing and what I would expect from a high end steakhouse restaurant, not a neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  But the most important thing that stood out was that I felt she loved working there and was happy with her surroundings which usually comes from great management and ownership.   Mercedes was outstanding!    I experience here began even before I met my service.  I'm talking about the hostess that sat me!    When I arrived this place was really busy!  I was a single and the bar was full so I told the hostess and she immediately said \"that's ok, we can seat you and sat me at a 4 top during peak hours and no other tables available that I could see!    Menu was what I expected from classic Mexican food.  My staple Mexican dish is the pollo queso or pollo fundido as other places would call it.  #1 thing to look for on a good Mexican restaurant is this dish and all other dishes can be based off of this.  I also ordered my #2 dish, a cheese enchilada a la carte, which is normally what I have to get because my #1 is not on the menu.  Both were good but the up sell and service delivered made me go even further and get dessert as well.  Fried ice cream!  Also great.  I could barely walk out of here I was so full.  Kept thinking this was such a great experience I wanted to order more but just couldn't do it!    Great job guys!  Mercedes, you were awesome!"}
{"text":"I am completely and utterly confused about these reviews?!! For years I have heard about how great the food is and how people always by the salsa and chips.   I ordered a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yep..water poured out of this burrito. I was like WTF?  I regretly tried a bite and it was dry flavorless and the little flavor it did have tasted like fish!!!   The water must have been from it being premade and frozen, Or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days.  The chips were stale and thick gross had a strange flavor. The salsa was so gross it was unedible.   What is wrong with you people, did you drop acid before you ate here?"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening, the place was busy but we got seated quickly. Service was prompt and friendly. Chips and salsa came quickly but the salsa was in a bottle but no bowl to put it in, I asked the server & he said people just use the plate and pointed to a little bread plate on the table. How are you suppose to dip your chips into a plate of salsa? He brought us some little to go containers to put our salsa in, turns out it didn't matter since the chips were out of a bag and not very good. I got a combo plate, my taco shell was just as dull and tasteless as the chips, the inside of the taco was fine. Tostada Was the same as the taco. My enchilada was good but but had so much sauce I couldn't even see the enchilada. Rice and beans were average. Overall with a few changes and some different chips and taco shells this could be a good place, but for now it's not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is a great Mexican comfort food place that serves it up in huge portions for a moderate price.   We stopped here last evening and were blowing away by the quantity, taste and value of this family run cantina. Virtually everything is in the $8 to $11 range, so how can you go wrong?   If UR looking for a white table cloth experience, then don't bother. But if you want Nachos served on a 12\" pizza tin (look how tiny the folk looks in the photo) that could feed three and taste great, then this is your place. Even before I started eating, I asked for two \"to go\" boxes!  2! LOL.  Expect to pay $20 each, including $9 for their 12 oz Margarita, before taxes and gratuities.  Three and 1/2 stars and we'll be back when we're hungry for more."}
{"text":"Their food has been on-point and consistent for years. Their cheese is amazing! Happy hour rules here."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican place in the valley!  It has the safe, welcoming feeling of a big restaurant but the taste of authentic Mexican"}
{"text":"I would have given Ajo Al's a four star rating instead of a five star because of the tortillas. The food in general is very good but the tortillas are average. I have found that Mama Lola's tortillas are the best out there. Their baked fresh daily in Phoenix. I found out about Mama Lola's tortillas when I ate at another Mexican restaurant and loved their tortillas. Great food, average tortillas."}
{"text":"Beware of this place!  I went a few years ago and found a black hair in my salad (I am blond) and was disgusted! They replaced the salad and still charged me for it.  Fast forward three years and my Mother-in-Law found a cockroach in her taco salad.  My husband's family has been going to this restaurant for quite a while.  Not anymore!! The waitress asked if she wanted to take a new salad to go (she lost her appetite but give in at the waitress insisting).  She got it to go and was charged.  The owner was a complete jerk and argued that the bug could have flown in.. On top of that, the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale and have been looking for our new go-to Mexican food place... found it! Green sauce was fantastic! Shredded chicken enchiladas and fresh salsa were exactly what we wanted. Yay Ajo Al's!"}
{"text":"I had been disappointed to not be able to stay in either downtown Tempe or closer-in Scottsdale. But Ajo Al's was walkable from our hotel and understandably very popular. It's not high end, but it had a lot of good options and satisfied my desire to get good Tex-Mex while near Phoenix. Queso was great, my son's traditional fajitas were very good, and my rwx mex pulled pork tacos were small as I hoped and quite delicious.  Server was very friendly and unnecessarily apologetic when something it wasn't immediately as he expected."}
{"text":"Very very poor service  Waitress name Mercedes very rude and she said tortillas \" are her most expensive food on the menu\"  So I ordered floor tortillas and was told that the most expensive stuff in our menu why would you say that to your customers we only got two tortillas and there was a total of four people and then she says go and tell us go get your own tortillas.    Food is very bad  Salsa is ok  Drinks ok  But service is and horrible  I won't recommend any to waste their $$"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Their margaritas are fantastic! So many to choose from........not enough days in the week. This time, the chips were a bit less than fresh and super thick. I like mine a bit thinner and fresher and saltier. The portions are huge! You must get the bean dip and that easily can be dinner for 2, but we always order 2 entrees anyway. Delicious for breakfast the next day! The one I go to is near Scottsdale and Shea. It's always crowded and it is because the food is good. Everything I've had is good, Mexican pizzas, enchiladas, flautas, tacos, salads, soups."}
{"text":"Ok me again.  This is my second time here from out of town.  Can a meal be even better the second time?  YES.   From their fabulous outdoor heated patio to their happy hour specials, salsa's, and staff  --this place is awesome to me.    It feels authentic Mexican.  It tastes authentic.  And who would pass up happy hour specials this good?   Not me.   They also have WiFi.   ?"}
{"text":"Went to Ajo Al's because my parents love the place (they eat anything). We walked in and waited for someone to seat us and waited and waited and waited. A full 5 minutes later, no lie - it was 5 minutes, someone did finally come to us to ask if we were helped. We got to our table, we received 2 bowls of chips, all chips were tiny tiny, ya know the chips at the bottom of the bag. Looked like they didn't want to cook fresh chips so they served the crumbs that they had. Nevertheless, chips are chips so we still ate them. I ordered the cheese conqueso dip and when the server delivered it was very thin, almost a liquid consistency. I didn't want to say anything but my mom did and the waiter brought us shredded cheese that we added to the conqueso and made it right, ourselves (aren't we paying someone to do this for us?)  Anyway, besides everything that happened BEFORE getting our lunch, lunch was fabulous. Like always, their food is great. Maybe an off night?   I would have rated it more but they need to work on a few things!  #1 customer service! especially in a society that is going through a recession."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location since they opened and have never had a bad meal. They service is superior and the staff always has a smile for you."}
{"text":"Pretty much run of the mill Mexican joint.  Stopped in for lunch.  Greeted with chips and salsa.  Not much spice.  That could be a positive for some.  My girl and I had a couple of lunch specials.  Good food.  Just not something to go out of the way for."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant a few years back and I was not impressed so didn't come back.  However, my friends really wanted to go here and so I came with them.  The chips and salsa were pretty good, choice of regular or hot salsa!  I had the special of the day which was one fish and one steak soft taco with black beans.  It was a more healthy choice and I was glad that is what I ordered since Mexican food tends to sit in my stomach longer.  The service was good, hostess and server were most friendly.  My friends enjoyed their dishes especially the spinach enchilada which is a good choice for vegetarians.  Not bad for a neighborhood restaurant..."}
{"text":"Wow--terrible experience. We waited for several minutes for a hostess. When she came, not only did she not apologize for the wait, she also didn't greet us or say any words at all before abruptly showing us to our table. Bizarre. While seated, we watched two other groups leave after waiting to be seated for several minutes. The waiter(?) also didn't greet us as he plopped a pitcher of water and some tortilla chips and salsa on our table. Guess we will pour it ourselves. More waiting. And THEN I discovered a HAIR in my mouthful of chips and salsa. APPALLING. Perhaps if we had encountered a single person on the way out, we wouldn't have told the groups waiting that they shouldn't waste their time. One of the worst \"dining\" experiences I've ever had. Save yourself and select one of the many restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"The salsa is soooo addictive, I could (and practically do) eat it as a meal before my meal even arrives at the table!  It isn't anything fancy, but this place will take care of any Mexican food craving you are having.  Dog friendly patio, and great service. I have never had a meal at Ajo Al's that wasn't delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to Ajo Al's probably over 50 times over the last 15 years. This is definitely one of my favorite mexican restaurants. The chips are a bit greasy, but taste amazing. If you like hot salsa, request the \"hot red salsa\". You have to ask for it, they don't just bring it out. For years I would gorge myself on the gigantic Pollo Con Queso entree. I really don't enjoy over eating & a couple years ago I discovered the mini chicken chimi's on the kids meal... I order that, asking for it \"con queso style\" and I still have left overs to take home! They also have an awesome seasonal Watermelon margarita. If it's not currently on the menu, the mango margarita is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I had the spinach enchilada with corn tortillas and white sauce!  Delicious!!!!   I was visiting the area and this restaurant was recommended. Good recommendation and will return the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, Had a few things and over all I am very happy with the food quality. This particular time I enjoyed a dinner combo that consisted of a red cheese enchilada, and shredded beef taco, and a green chili burrito. The enchiladas red sauce was very dark and very tasty, the taco was as good as a taco can be and I liked the green chili burrito however I would have rather had green chili pork instead of green chili beef.....Overall great experiance and good food."}
{"text":"My first visit to Ajo Al's.  The waitress was kind enough, but she was overworked and not able to keep up...lots of waiting.  To start out with, and to repeat someone's earlier comment, the guacamole didn't taste like it was made in house...sorta tasted like a mix...it was a little off in flavor.  The main course, tacos del mar, was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since around 1988..  Everything on the menu is a good choice. From pollo conqueso, fajitas, burritos (enchilada style), pizza nortena, salad carbon, etc. I like spicy and when you ask for it they actually do it. Happy Hour is great with $3.00 house margs and discounted apps. We come here once a week. Definitely one of our all time favorites."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this particular Ajo Al's location for as long as I can remember. It's always been a neighborhood staple to those who grew up in the area as it's conveniently located and the prices are really reasonable.  As I've grown older and taken more notice of things like quality of food and level of service, Ajo Al's has gone a bit down in how I'd rate the place. Don't get me wrong, every time I come I know exactly what I'm going to get, and so should you!  They overload you on chips and salsa which is awesome because I friggin' love chips and salsa, but beware of filling up too quickly. The service is always a bit lacking, sometimes slow, sometimes not the friendliest. The margaritas are decent, but they never put enough ice in them when you order it on the rocks. The food itself is average, I usually like the combo plate with a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada or the fajitas with chicken and steak. Pollo Con Queso is the fan favorite here, I have friends who will swear by it every time they come.  Overall, it's a decent place to get Mexican food where the food is consistent, service is so-so, and you wont have to break the bank on your bill."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I have ever had. The amount of salt they use on the food is unbearable. Maybe they have to do that to cover up the already foul taste of the food. Service was good that would be the one and only positive. Don't even know how you over salt guac."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Mexican Restaurants I've been to. Portions were generous and weren't overly spicy (huge help when going there with kids). Our waiter was a shining example of great service with a fun personality. He even brought us sauces to try since he knew we'd never been there before. I would go back there next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Tamale was the best I've had I years. My wife loves the damn things and I and me eh whatever. But the one we had tonight was amazing. This with a mescal margarita was magic.  Who knew any place made Margs with medical? Not me!  I will be back. Uber please!"}
{"text":"Our first trip to Ajo Als.We had a wonderful lunch here today. Really authentic tasting. Great values and service. The homemade chips were awesome. I had a chicken enchilada in white jalapeno sauce. Filled with loads of chicken and served with rice n beans. I'd order it again and only $9.00 .My husbands combo plate was very tasty also. Wish we had this place up here in Prescott!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and hot drinks. Also had multiple u tinsel that were dirty. When i spoke with the manager she commented that the dishes at times get dirty because of the queso. On top of all that, the food was smothered in cheese to cover the dense content inside."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Ajo Als for many years.  At least twenty.  My daughter and I came in today for our weekly lunch together.   One of the reasons that we like to come here is that over the years the service as well as the food quality have been well over average. And both service and food are consistent.  I have often praised the training given the staff. Today the food, like always, was delicious.  However the service left a lot to be desired. We started out sharing a cheese crisp.  Then my daughter had the Carne Asada tacos and I had my usual shredded beef chimichanga.  We shared a fried ice cream to top off our meal.  I also ordered my husband's two favorite things to take home for him.  Chili Relleno and a Carne Asada Burrito.   Our server, Chapo, may have been new. He seemed to be a little lost.  I asked for more napkins at least four times until finally at the end of our meal, I got up and took them from the glass in the center of another table. While trying to share our dessert we are reaching over all of the dirty plates because he did not clear any of our plates when he brought the dessert.  He brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. A cardinal sin in the service business. Anyway,  all in all a good meal I just want to give constructive criticism on how the service could be better. We will be back because it is a favorite of our family's.  I guess I did not post this when I wrote it.  The actual day of our visit was Sunday April 29 not today.  I did not realize that I had not posted it!!"}
{"text":"Scratch my last review.  I'd rather give up the clean restrooms after all.  I was really disappointed at my last visit.  And let me tell you, it's hard to disappoint me if I'm having Mexican food.  But the salsa was blah, the green chile was blah, everything was blah.  I really should have considered the dire Mexican food situation in Scottsdale before moving here.  Now not only is my house worth less than my car, but I'm driving into Phoenix to eat anyway!"}
{"text":"We are 2 natives and have grown up eating good Mexican food all I of our lives. We had the worst meal today that either of us can remember. The chips were very dark brown-not sure if it was from old oil or if they were burned. The taco had a hard thick tasteless shell. The tamale was the worst. The Masa fell apart outside of the wrapper and the beef had large chunks of potato and green bell pepper. It was so wet that it just fell apart. We didn't eat it and the waitress didn't even ask what was wrong. The chili relleno lack any flavor and was essentially a chili with melted cheese. We were SO disappointed."}
{"text":"First time eating at Ajo Al's was when we were house hunting in the area (spring 1986).  We bought the house and have been regular customers ever since!"}
{"text":"I came here around 5 PM and surprised they had a nice happy hour menu.  First all, I had the Montezuma Margarita on the rocks.  It tasted cheap.  Like 2-stars.  Then came the chili con queso.  What a let down.  It didn't even taste like real cheese.  It tasted like cheap pre-made \"pseudo cheese mix\".  Yucky.  Very watery.  Then came the bean dip.  It tasted neither good nor fresh.  2.5-3.0 stars.  The 4 mini beef chimis were about a 2.5-3.0 stars as well.  The beef taco I would give 3.0 stars.  Overall, the food here is a grade below Taco Bell.  Cheap fast food for cheap prices.  Bill before tax and tip was 16.00.    Did something happen? This place used to be really good at one point."}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is pretty much a Phoenix staple in the sense that it's been around for a long, long, while. This is your generic Mexican food. It's perfect for a family-dinner, perfect for a casual dinner and perfect for one (or several) margaritas.   The atmosphere here is casual with the character of a Mexican restaurant. I enjoy the food here when I'm in the mood for something hearty and cheesy. Their Salad Carbon is absolutely amazing. It's the opposite of fat free but that's what makes it so good right? This salad comes with either marinated steak or chicken and it's topped with mushrooms, avocado, shredded cheese that melts with the heat of the meat and this delicious Jalepeno ranch dressing. It's a must if you visit."}
{"text":"Stood at the hostess stand for 10 mins and no one ever came to seat us. Finally just left. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Even though the current decor/layout has been around for around 10 years, it still holds up well. The prices also haven't increased much over that time, so it's still a great neighborhood mexican restaurant. Been coming here for almost 20 years though, I remember back when they had a smoking section.   Food and service is still great. Pro tip, they have a hot salsa that they don't bring out by default, but if you ask for it, they will bring you some. Try it, I like cutting it 50/50 with their mild salsa."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix & one of my favorites. A very good selection here, I like that they have a Chicken Mole dish, which seems hard to find.  Waaaay better than the overrated Manual's & that Tee Pee Mexican place, which are more like on the level of Del Taco....ew!"}
{"text":"My family & I have been long time customers at this location. The food is consistently good & you can't beat the happy hour. Staff very nice. I personally feel the place could be cleaner & would suggest staff sit in booths & look at walls around booth to see splatters on walls etc. I'm not a fan of the new menu artwork/readability.  Gone are the \"al a carte\" items. ???  When I asked the server about it she actually said \"we took them off because we can do everything al a carte\".  Well that works out just fabby if you don't care what $$ your paying for something. Sounds like an opportunity for the business to make $. I guess the Customer can ask each time the want something .. \"I'll have a taco, how much is that?\", add a side of sour cream... how much is that? Enchilada style would be good... how much extra?\"  Yeah.... that sounds like a load of embarrassing customer fun."}
{"text":"By far my favorite causal place to eat!! Between my husband and myself we have tried at least 3/4 of the menu as this was a weekly date night spot for years.   I can't say enough about the service. The staff is so nice and as a regular they remember what we like to get even if we haven't been in in awhile. There is almost never a wait unless you are going Friday or Saturday evening, and even then the wait time in minimal.  One thing to keep in mind when ordering is that a few of their appetizers are quite large and should be split among large groups ( nachos or any of their Mexican pizzas). My personal favorite though is the Chili con Queso dip. Another ordering tip is that they will bring you regular salsa with your chips but they actually have spicier ones if you ask your server.   I could go on and on about what I like about each dish but you just need to go there and try them for yourself."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful server but the food coming out of the kitchen was not good!  Times are tuff I understand, we have to cut corners....I understand but when the chips taste like \"Blah\" and the salsa has that tin-y taste its time to regroup and figure out the priorities.  My buddy had chicken tacos and gave them a 2 and I had the stacked enchiladas and gave them a 1.  I would not call this Sonoran food I would call this Tex-Mex and that is what I just got done putting up with for 20 years!      Ajo Al it is time to up your game!  Please do not discount this establishment based on my experience...give Ajo AL a chance and form your own opinion.   I want independents to excel but I also want to be wowed!  Did not happen today, but the employees have life and the place has a good vibe!"}
{"text":"I liked the feel of the restaurant and the menu items are great I just didn't enjoy the \"loudness\" of the establishment as well as the long wait for our food...  Our server was fun and nice and she kept apologizing for how long our food was taking... I didn't mind because I had a house margarita in hand... If I didn't have that, this would be another story...  I ordered tacos, the something chicken tacos, I don't remember the name... The sides were rice and beans... The dish itself was very good  However the ambience and \"wait\" time just didn't do it for me here...  Perhaps another try in the future..."}
{"text":"Love the salad carbon with chicken, the jalapeno ranch dressing is so yummy.  It's the only reason I go to Ajo Als.  The salsa needs to be served in a small bowl like every other Mexican restaurant. Pouring it on a plate then trying to scoop it up is irritating and you can't pour it onto your chip without looking like a dumb ass. It's not that great anyway.  The service here ALWAYS stinks. Slow, slow, slow and inattentive no matter what time of day I go in. Last time I went it was late, there were 2 other tables there and our server took his sweet time showing up to take say hi, take our drink order, forget about asking for extra chips, refills, etc as he was nowhere to be seen. I understand the servers have close out duties at the end of the night but maybe they could have had the hostess help out instead of her yapping to 3 girlfriends the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Ajo Al's reached out to me today. Not only did they listen to all of us. But, they were kind enough to reach out to me personally. Red chili is back on the menu. Thank you! (It was in response to this.... I have been visiting and absolutely loving Ajo Al's for well over 20 years. And, we eat there faithfully about one a week. Today I found out to my surprise and utter confusion, they have decided to completely remove red chili from their menu! (That means no more red chili burros, among other favorite similar dishes.) Bring it back and I will gladly rerate back to a 5*. #bringredchiliback #don'tfixwhatisntbroken) #ajoalsrocks"}
{"text":"Service was good, attentive.  Pitcher of Marg, ok Food, Not very good Dont think its all fresh Or all made on site"}
{"text":"Yummy food and good service. I tried the Pollo Con Queso the first time I came here and I'm hooked. I should try something else, but it's so yummy! The salsa could use more kick for my taste but it's decent."}
{"text":"The food here was good. In fact, the food was even better three days later as leftovers. Don't ask why, some food is just like that. The service, however, was not so good. We came in 40 minutes before closing. That's more than enough time for two people to eat and get decent service but they acted like we slipped in the door as they were locking up. This is the only restaurant I have ever been to where our drink order was never taken. Good thing they brought a pitcher of water out. Not once did our server stop by during the meal to see if we needed anything, just dropped off the check. We got a lot of food for the money but probably won't be going back because I guess 8:20's too late to eat dinner."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fresh. You get chips and salsa when you sit down. If the salsa is too mild for you, just ask for something spicier. I like the spicy green salsa, but the spicy red is also tasty. I ordered the poco pollo con queso lunch special. It is fabulous and not diet friendly, but since I think dieting is stupid (albeit an occasional necessary evil), I was fine with it. It is stuffed with flavorful, shredded white meat chicken and has creamy cheesy sour cream layers on top, then served with a side of beans and rice. I also had a frozen toasted almond margarita. Don't let the name scare you, it is a delightful and delicious frosty amaretto-ish tasting concoction. The bar area is small and the service is friendly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!!!! Definitely coming back here when we're in town for spring training :) great choice if you're looking for authentic Mexican!!! Absolutely loved their shrimp fajitas!!! My husband also enjoyed their chicken street tacos!!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's is the benchmark for us, that all other Mexican Food establishments are measured.  We have been regular customers since their inception at 90th street; and since being transferred out of state, every return to the valley includes a dining experience at Ajo Al's.  I think the notable differences for us, is the quality of white chicken they use in their dishes; it's not canned, nor mixed with dark meat.  The shredded beef tacos are superb, and guess what, cheese crisps are pretty much unknown beyond the state of Arizona!  So if you are a first time guest, you can expect more of a Tex/Mex flavor, and would recommend a combo plate letter F, or anything with Chicken!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend.  He said it was one of his family's fav spots.  I went to check it out with The Better Half and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was a little better than ok but just shy of a full 4 Stars, but I'm upgrading to 4 Stars because of the service.    They started out with the complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were just ok.  Salsa was too runny and bland for my tastes.  I prefer it with a thicker consistency and spicier. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=BVcuBjkGkzOq6aCuT79B3g#BVcuBjkGkzOq6aCuT79B3g  ....so I asked for the real deal Spicy Salsa, and they went to the kitchen and brought it out for me, which was awesome. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=V-gPwFtgugPtMDkWlWITog#V-gPwFtgugPtMDkWlWITog  The Better Half ordered the Mushroom Enchiladas, which she absolutely loved.  She's a Mushroom fan, so this dish worked out well for her. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=LKdOTSLvDBup108Tu3574Q#LKdOTSLvDBup108Tu3574Q  I decided to order the 1/2 Plate of Nachos....I'm a Nacho lover, but wasn't expecting the gigantic portion which was labeled \"1/2 Order\".....1/2?!  I'd hate to see what a \"full\" plate looked like!!  LOL  It was a pleasant surprise and I took it as a challenge to finish it, which I did to the amazement of our server...TBH wasn't too happy though and the tables around us were laughing when they saw it delivered to me, LOL. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=eyUIpaHaw8wsgbqlX1y5XA#eyUIpaHaw8wsgbqlX1y5XA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=8Xor4v7BBwS-0dCqOeRWZA#8Xor4v7BBwS-0dCqOeRWZA  Overall, this was a fun place to have dinner and the food was a shy over 3 Stars.  Servers here are accommodating and pleasant, which earned the 4th Star.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. Prices, however, have gotten a little steep. Now they charge extra if my daughter asks for some ranch dressing on the side of her $15 entree."}
{"text":"I agree with the other one star reviews.  This place is like taco bell with waiters.  Actually, I think i like taco bell more.  It is noooooo mexican restaurant.  They load up everything with costco shredded cheese and sour creme.  Don't waste your money.  Go to a real taqueria for real mexican."}
{"text":"Not too impressed, there are much better Mexican restaurants around.  The tacos however are pretty good.  The salsa is pretty bad.   Also can't shake the whole health department-forced shutdown a few years back."}
{"text":"A friend took us to a place called Carlsbad Tavern and the Mexican food was too hot for us.... so he suggested we try Ajo Al's and said it was his favorite not-too-spicy Mexican food in the area.    The service was good, but unfortunately the food was pretty average.  Your basic Americanized Mexican food.  Nothing to write home about, but no need to avoid it if you happen to be hungry for Mexican food and are nearby."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa (only wish they have small bowls for the salsa though instead of plates). The frozen margaritas are my favorite in town and their happy hour is amazing. This place is our \"go to\" for Mexican."}
{"text":"I wrote a semi-scathing review of the Ajo Al's on 16th street, but I want to make clear that this particular store is considerably better than its Phoenician counterpart.   I'm not sure exactly what it is that makes this experience so much better, but I think it's a blend of the ambiance and the food. First off, the decor is much nicer, and the art more tasteful, and the food is just plain better. Don't get me wrong, it still doesn't make my top ten mexican food spots in Phoenix, but it isn't bad for Tex-Mex.  Great for gringos looking for some satisfying grub, without wanting to burn anything or overwhelm the taste buds."}
{"text":"I'm not overly impressed with Ajo Al's.   I was dining with a large group, so maybe that explains the waitress's snappy demeanor. I didn't feel very welcome in this restaurant. Luckily I had some wonderful company make up for this!  Chips and salsa were kind of generic...and the salsa was presented in these carafes...not overly appetizing, but that's just me. Usually I find myself going back to the chip basket, but I found it surprisingly easy to hold myself back before our entrees arrived.   I had the chicken fajitas. You know the best part of fajitas?  The sounds, smells and attention each sizzling skillet receives as it's carried out of the kitchen.   Sadly, mine had none of these attributes. A couple people in my party had this pleasure, but I did not. My only guess is my plate was sitting under a heat lamp as the first round of orders were carried out. Perhaps I should've ordered something else.   On the plus side, the guac was incredibly fresh, the tortillas were tender, and the rice was very good."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Food I ordered was not at all what I expected. I returned it without touching it and was still charged. I would have expected out of consideration for it be removed. We spent $80 on other things we ordered. Approximately 45 min after leaving I ended up with nausea and a headache. Wondered if maybe the food contained MSG. Would definitely not recommend this restaurant with so many good places to eat in the valley."}
{"text":"Food is basic casual Mexican; chimichangas, burros, flautas... But it is tasty and I had great, fast service at the bar on Saturday evening. Friendly staff, good atmosphere with friendly customers too."}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeded our expectations. The portions are HUGE!! You definitely get a lot for your money. The food was super fresh and they put a ton of cheese, not like other places who are cheap about it. We are here on vacation and I want to go again before we leave! I had the taco w shredded beef , enchilada w ground beef, and tostada combo. The enchilada was the BEST I ever had!!! Get in the car and go now!! Oh and I forgot the guacamole was so fresh and delicious. I usually have to \"Doctor it up\" but not here, the way they prepared it I didn't need to even add salt!"}
{"text":"Today I experienced a beyond ordinary wait period for my food to come out, from what can only be described as a lackluster waitstaff, and my order wasn't even correct! They seemed quite shortstaffed, but after asking the \"manager\" he said they were not at all short staffed and offered no apology for the delay in my food, the poor service, or the apparently typical ritual of bringing the bill out prior to any food... I can only assume this is because otherwise everyone would walk out rather than staying to wait for their food, but once you've pre-paid it seems obligatory to wait. On top of it, no monetary or service compensation was offered - I've recieved better service from hole-in-the-wall places. Overall, this was my second eerily similar bad experience, from a formerly frequent lunch place, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Ajo Als for years and love the food here! It's our favorite local Mexican restaurant and we always bring visitors here. Delicious chips/salsa, food, and drinks as well as amazing customer service!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tatiana made me laugh AND made me delicious beverages; bloody Marys, coffee cocktails, and margaritas, oh my! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and margaritas (best pitcher Cadillac margaritas, especially when Ricky is behind the bar!) I'm a big fan of their shrimp fajitas Caliente style, carnitas street tacos, regular chicken and beef tacos, queso dip, and cheese crisp! The food is always fresh and delicious! They recently added TVs on the patio which is great because it's one of the only patios that stays cool enough to sit on during the summer months with the dog (yes, they are dog-friendly!)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, then you are in the wrong place.  Came here for birthday party lunch, our food came in 45 minutes and the restaurant wasn't event busy. The food was OK, lacked of flavor.  Couple of us we're up for churo and guess what, they didn't have it."}
{"text":"Wonderful happy hour! Love the strong margaritas and good food too. Service is quick and staff are courteous. Best Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"We love this place, especially for happy hour. The shredded beef tacos are to die for best value of any restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, the food is really just so so.  The rice was the best part, but everything else felt like you're eating at the run of the mill Mexican-American place.  The service was slow, hence we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I really love Ajo Al's! I've been to all the locations and they are all uniquely decorated which makes the trip to each one that much more exciting!!  The food at each location slightly varies, which adds to the excitement as well. My girlfriends and I love taste testing different entrees and comparing them. With that said we've never had a bad meal here before!!"}
{"text":"Solid food and a cozy atmosphere.   I love Mexican food, but can't stand how it typically comes in only two styles. Dirty and cheap. Or fancy and way overpriced. Ajo's Al's is that much needed middle ground. Delivering some quality food, but doesn't try to be upscale.   We went on Saturday night at 7:30. The place was pretty busy, but we were still seated right away and water and chips and Salsa were on the table just seconds later (which was great because I was starving). The waitress was really friendly, and she did something I really appreciate. When I ordered the Relleno Chicken Dinner, she warned me that it was covered in a very spicy sauce. I happen to love spicy food, but warning customers about something that's not written on the menu is what a good server should do.   The Relleno was excellent. It was wonderful to have a chicken and cheese stuffed pepper that wasn't deep fried. And she wasn't kidding about the sauce! With Rice and Beans, and the chips and salsa, I was more than set for the night. My girlfriend tried the Ono Fajitas. I applaud the effort of trying to cook a fish fajita, but it didn't work out so well. The fish was a little over cooked, and it's probably a result of sitting in the skillet. It wasn't too bad, but I tried a piece and wouldn't recommend it.   The restaurant itself is very casual. It's pretty much on par with the set up of any Mexican family restaurant chain. I really enjoyed dining here on a random Saturday night."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this location with a group of friends.  The location was able to very quickly accommodate our group (~10) during lunchtime and the server for our table was friendly and attentive.  Since that first visit, I've been back with the family.  This review will include the experience for both visits.  I've struggled to find what I consider good Mexican fare here in the valley - probably not because of a lack of good places but because I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food and long for good ol' Tex Mex (can someone here please have carne GUISADA on their menu already?!).  The salsa was nice, but was a bit awkward with the carafe... Salsa is best eaten from a bowl type of vessel so you can get that chip and really get it in there.  It's just not the same scraping it off a plate, trying to get the last yummy bite.    I had the shrimp salad on my first visit, and the second time around, I went for the pollo con queso.  The shrimp was flavorful, but overcooked so it was tough.  They were friendly when accommodating my request for half an avocado on the salad instead of just one slice.  The dressing was delicious - reminiscent of Chuy's creamy jalapeno.  The pollo con queso was a delightful dish and a very large portion (enough for next day's lunch).  I requested a little side of that yummy dressing I remembered from the first visit and went a little crazy dipping bites of the chicken in it.    We'll definitely be going back to try more of the menu items and some of the house cocktails."}
{"text":"I ate here and was in the bathroom three times.  Not a great experience.  I give it two stars because the servers are nice, but their food is just not good at all.    Their location on 16th St & Camelback has excellent queso dip.  We ordered it here and it felt like plastic.  The flavor was ok, but you had to keep stirring it so it wouldn't congeal up.    Ordered their rolled taco plate.  When it came out the cheese wasn't melted on it, the rice was bland, beans were bland.  The meat on the inside was ok, but I couldn't finish it.    What happened Ajo?  You guys were once great.  Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I used to go to the two Ajo Al's locations in north Scottsdale every now and then several years ago, and I always liked them. A friend of mine was in town for work recently and wanted Mexican food. He was staying near this location so I suggested it.   It's been a LONG time since I had been to an Ajo Al's, but this location seems bigger. It was crowded when we came, but we were able to get a table pretty quickly.   The menu is pretty much how I remember it. I wasn't completely starving when I came, so I didn't get any queso dip, but I used to be OBSESSED with it and I hope it's the same. When I say I used to come here every now and then with friends often times we came specifically for that dip. The chips and salsa that they serve here is good. I like runnier salsa, which is what they serve at Ajo Al's, and I like to mix with just a touch of the spicy salsa to give the mild just enough of a kick.   For my meal I got one of the combo platters...a chicken burrito in green sauce with beans and rice. The portions here are HUGE and the chicken was cooked well. The beans and rice were pretty standard, but are good if you add some salsa.   Our waitress was attentive and nice. One thing I noticed about this location is that is can get LOUD.  Prices are fair (especially considering the portions). I've never understood \"fancy\" Mexican places, and if I'm not going to a little take-out place I prefer a casual restaurant like Ajo Al's for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I went to ajo al's tonight for dinner and the food was absolutely amazing as well as my server! Whether you have a family or are just going out to drink, ajo al's hits the spot every time. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ate here recently for lunch, the food was great! the price was great as well. I loved the salsa as well as the cream cheese that came with my flaunt as. What a great kick it had. Will come again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for about 10 years. The margaritas are some of the best I've had anywhere, frozen or on the rocks. I typically order the flautas, tostadas, or tacos and have never been disappointed.   Its a nice family place to go for good food, and a place to catch up."}
{"text":"This is no Mexican restaurant. First, the chips are like paper, flavorless, cold, stale.  The salsa is partially made from canned tomatoes and taste like it.  No flavor going on at all with the salsa other than canned tomatoes, Even the grenn chli sauces was awful. Trader Joe's sales out of a bottle is better. Next the beans too are lack flavor other than a lot of salt.  They were dry as well. I have the Fajita's, beef. They were oily.  Vegi's were fine, the meat was tough. My son had a bean burrito and they didn't get the order right. Do they apologize for getting wrong? Nope.  All they could say was it wasn't on the order despite the fact the manager took our order because the server failed to helps us out after 10 minutes of waiting. Finally, the food didn't settle well at all.  Overall, I wouldn't suggest that my worse enemy go to this restaurant...that's ain't no Mexican restaurant!  Whoever makes those recipes out to be fired."}
{"text":"Great choices and never disappoint!  If you are craving Mexican, this is one of the better places to go to.  I like that they use good white meat chicken for their dishes.  They have good chips and salsa too, I just don't like they way they serve them, hard to scoop up off a plate, but doesn't stop me. I do think they tend to be on the expensive side, but I grew up in Cali where great Mexican food is inexpensive and portions always huge."}
{"text":"love your 90th street  ajo al's....you have one of the best happy hours in town....never had a disappointment while dining with you.. loved your red envelope affair.... thank you for providing great food,and outstanding margaritas.. keep up with your red envelope program.. bright orange for spring....."}
{"text":"We frequent here quite often, at least once a month. We usually come in for lunch because they have great specials with even better prices. The portions are massive and the food is always good. It's nothing super special worth writing home about, but solid Mexican comfort food. I typically get a chimichanga, sometimes beef, sometimes chicken. It's always good. My fiancé typically gets the floutas (spelling?), which are like taquitos. I've had enchilada here before and he's had fajitas. Always solid. The margaritas are hit or miss, I've had some that are really watery and some that were good. Usually I stick to iced tea at lunch because Pepsi just isn't my thing. The service is usually good, we used to get a rather sullen server at lunch, but haven't seen him in a long time. The last half dozen times we've been has been spot on. Good combination of both men and women servers which is nice to see. Also, I saw a review a few below mine that touched on Mercedes' service. I've had her a number of times and I've always found her to be really pleasant and friendly, so I was kind of shocked to see that. I don't usually comment on servers individually in Yelp reviews because I've been a server so I understand that it can really hurt that person if something bad is said about them. So, I just wanted to throw that in there."}
{"text":"Their salsa and queso is really good.  But, almost everything is smothered in cheese and grease.  You will feel sick after eating basic enchiladas here because of how much extra cheese and heavy sauce they put on them.  Their chicken burrito is HUGE and way too much for one person.  Our waitress was pretty attentive, but that didn't make up for feeling really sick later."}
{"text":"Portions are large. Almost too large if you ask me. I've yet to finish my lunch order in a single sitting. I do enjoy the salsa. Not my favorite in Scottsdale, but it'll do. I'm seeing rave reviews about their Happy Hour. Going to have to give that a shot soon. Love me some margaritas.   My two experiences here have been during lunch. Both times I walked in and was seated quickly. Both times I had to keep asking for more salsa (major NEGATIVE points in my book). Both times the service was friendly. Both times I thought I paid too much for my meal. Will I return? Only when it's my co-workers choice on where to eat."}
{"text":"I've been an Ajo Als fan for 20+ years, but the 90th St location has changed that. Just went there for a late lunch, and the place was filthy, service was terrible and food was just oily and flavorless. On top of that, my daughter found some identifiable objects in her meal, utensils were cruddy and one of the chip plates had very obvious crust on it. The women's room was incredibly dirty, dingy and the entire restaurant is looking just plain rundown and neglected. The booth we were in was detached from the wall and separated from the base, so you could see years of grunge and misc objects that had piled up through the years. The lights were burned out around our table, which made it even seedier feeling, Lunch at 230pm on a Saturday, so the place was fairly empty, yet it took 30 minutes to get a cheese crisp, some rice and 2 salads (not the kind ordered), then another 5-10 minutes to get the 2 salads we actually ordered (which were so greasy they were basically inedible).from the moment we got there, there dirty tables all around us, and I even cleared some dirty dishes from our table and put them on a nearby dirty table (as servers and other staff watched), yet they just walked by the piles of gross dishes over and over. So bizarre. I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like. BLECH. I will never ever ever go to this place again."}
{"text":"We keep coming back cause food is fresh and wait staff is very attentive! Mercedes always makes sure food is prepared correctly and Margaritas are just right! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"About a year ago, Ajo Al's remodeled (a little) and changed their menu (a little) and changed their concept (a little).  They are now a \"cafe\" which means ... I'm not sure what it means.  But I do know that the booths are now in good repair, the chips come in a prettier bowl, and the consistency of cooking, at least at this location, has improved dramatically.  If our last two visits are typical, Ajo Al's is back to being a more than acceptable neighborhood Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in approximately 20 years, when I used to visit friends in Scottsdale.....still delicious! Came here with the kiddos and my mom. Able to order a few things from the Happy Hour menu..cheese crisp, gold margarita and then ordered the guacamole, too. All of it was super tasty. Ordered the chicken flautas with the spiced cream cheese (slapped on salsa and guac too, of course), and it was ridiculous!  Our little waitress Tatiana was AWESOME..especially since she clued us into finding a Groupon for tonight's dinner. She handled all of us quite well...and I'll be honest, we're pretty high maintenance. So, definite props to her (and a very happy birthday!)  This is still a terrific place, with yummy food, and great service... Do yourselves a favor, and get in there. :)"}
{"text":"Had the lunch Pollo con queso special. The chicken was pretty dry, and had no discernible flavor.  The jalapeño cheese they topped it with wasn't very spicy, but was ok.  Our server was good, and they have decent salsa with their chips.  My second trip, mostly because it's close to work, and my coworker doesn't like Manuel's.  I may be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Philadelphia so when I first moved here I thought this place was so good, what do I know, I'm from the east coast.   The longer I have lived here, (7 years now) I realized how many Mexican restaurants are better than this place. Each time I went it got worse and worse, not only the food, but the service. Annoying things like not enough tequila in my margarita, cold meat in my taco and cold cheese on my Mexican pizza. Even if those things didn't happen I would still would not ever be going back."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.  Ajo Al's is fast Mexican food, and if you live in the area, it's a good alternative to Manuel's, or any of the other just okay Mexican food chains nearby.  They have great happy hour specials here and the margaritas are strangely good.  Usually, you don't get fantastic margaritas at places like this, but I have, a few times!  I think it might be the bartender and how he makes it, because when I went back another time, the female bartender didn't do it up quite as good. They're strong though, so be careful!"}
{"text":"I do wonder if there are just so many Mexican restaurants in the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale metropolitan area that people get very discriminating if they are local.  In that, a place that to an out of towner like me would seem really good is critiqued more harshly by the locals.    My take on this place after a friend brought me here is that the tacos are wonderful, the chips and salsa they give you are pretty good (I've had better chips out there), the Albondigas soup is something I don't get too often back home and I loved it, and that fried ice cream is to die for.    Solid 4 stars in my book.  But I'm from Philly.  To me this place is great Mexican.  You locals may be more picky than I am."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant until  a series of disappointing visits.  When I requested--in person and via phone-- to speak to the owner or manager and \"Patrick\" never returned my calls, I wrote them off.  Food AND service are now beyond disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't know which one I went to. I went once a few years back, but ALL i remember is:  Pollo con Queso. AMAZING. and Cheese Crisps. Californians.. you don't know what you're missing. Just enough cheese. Just enough crispy tortilla.   But the Chicken smothered in cream cheese and cheddar- is to die for.  Or at least drive over the state line for.  The reason I go to Arizona [besides family] is all about the Mexican food."}
{"text":"Uninspired restaurant chain Mexican food. Great service! They were really busy and our waitress was hustling to cover all of her tables. Went out if her way to make sure we were taken care of. Rice and beans tasted old. Over sauced main dishes trying desperately to add flavor. Dirty floors. Dirty stained seat cushions. Too many great places to go in Scottsdale. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Ajo Al's. My friend who is 102 yrs Old introduced me to it a couple of years ago...she and her husband loved it for many years.  I brought my husband here and it's become a favorite of ours as well.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time at this location last night. I used to visit the one near 16th and Camelback in Phoenix years ago. I'm glad to know there is one right down the road (it's not very noticeable - small signs).  Nice atmosphere, good service, and solid tex-mex style food (this is far from an authentic south-of-the-border experience). The soft tacos were well prepared with fresh ingredients. The rice and beans were excellent (the mark of a good Mexican joint). The salsa is above average, but go ahead and request the hot stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered thru uber eats and received the wrong order. Not uber eats fault. I called uber to confirm my order and add salsa. Did not receive the correct order and the queso was cold. If you are going to use uber eats for service you should confirm that the order is correct."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting friends in Scottsdale. They swore by this place, but I wasn't all impressed. Chips and salsa are average. I got the chicken and steak fajitas. They too were average, nothing incredibly special."}
{"text":"We order \"pick-up\" from Ajo Al's quite often or have it delivered by Uber Eats, and it is constantly good Mexican food. The thin chips (with salsa) that are always included are great, as well. The Chicken Chimichanga and Pollo Con queso entrees (with their Mexican rice and refried beans) are very good, however my recommendation is the \"Mexican Pizza\" which is a fantastic and filling twelve inch \"pizza\" that could easily feed four people. The bottom crispy tortilla is topped with a large amount of shredded chicken, or ground beef, with diced jalapeños & tomatoes, guacamole, a second crispy tortilla smothered with a generous layer of Mexican-blend cheese and a sprinkling of sliced green onions. I usually cannot finish two slices; it is that filling. The restaurant itself is what you would expect if you wanted to dine at a Mexican restaurant. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a little five seat bar."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal here today. Not my normal type of spot (prefer the more authentic divey types) but had some colleagues that wanted to hit it.  Service was great. Chips were good and were replenished throughout. Salsa was tasty. Drinks were kept filled.  As far as the food, it came out quickly, was hot and tasted good. Our table did 3 orders of pollo fundido (me included) and a shredded beef chimichanga. Nothing crazy but no complaints from anybody at the table. Though we did the poco lunch size, all of us had enough for another snack. Beans & rice were nice enough as well.  In some of the more chain-type spots, I find myself skipping on the rice & beans once I try them.  Wasn't the case here. They were good and I would have cleaned my plate if I didn't find myself ridiculously full about 2/3 of the way in.  While I won't seek out Ajo Al's, I definitely won't cringe as I sometimes do when work colleagues lead me to chains. I guess it is a local chain with only 4 locations after all.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere - definitely nicer than some of its competitors - I give Ajo's that off the bat.   Service was decent.  Food was ok - that was the consensus we had."}
{"text":"I went to Ajo Al's for Lunch on a Friday. Several of my co-workers raved about the restaurant but honestly I think there are more positive memories of the fun times had at the restaurant than the actual food.   The menu had the regular American Mexican fare. A decent priced lunch menu. Though the descriptions of the food were lacking.   I ordered a chicken chimi it came with rice and refried beans.   The waitress brings out the food and my chimi is DRENCHED in this redish brown sauce. I taste it: some smokey, tomatoey, pasty sauce.  My co-worker informs me its Ranchero. Its also inescapable.  The rice instant, the beans, blech. The Chicken in the chimi 50% chance of getting a moist piece. The food was just lacking overall. I was hungry so I ate half of it. My co-workers really enjoyed their entrees So maybe its just me.   I am far from blown away by Ajo Als. I don't see myself returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their Pizza Nortena. That's the only thing I get because I feel like I am depriving myself if I don't. If you have never tried it, TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend the chicken nortena.  It's cheese, cheese, and more cheese with some chicken that tastes like it came from a can.  The chicken enchiladas I got we're a little dry but the chicken didn't taste canned that time.  I would still like to try the mushroom enchilada.  If that's a fail then I won't be going back.  Everyone else seemed to like their food except for the kids.  So, 3 other adults liked it that I was with."}
{"text":"Wonderful Nacho chips, great Spinach enchiladas, Excellent Service."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to Ajo Al's and it's become one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in AZ! Love their salsa and the menu food is always fantastic. The service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Service is horrible!!! When the food did finally arrive after waiting over an hour, the rice was dry and hard as were the beans. The chips are stale. The fajitas were OK, nothing special but at least edible. The place was so old and rundown. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly efficient service.   We love Mexican food and this is the best we have ever had.  The pollo blanco enchiladas are amazing!   We are from Michigan and always try to do get there more than once during our visit."}
{"text":"Great fajitas and chicken anchilata.  Super service. My wine glass was not the best. It had water spots I guess. The food tastes fresh. A great spot for a quiet dinner. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and the food was decent.   They basically have two vegetarian items on the menu that aren't salads: guacamole tacos and garden fajitas. I wish they had something like a grilled veggies burrito or something to that effect.  I ordered the guacamole tacos and they were just ok. The guacamole didn't taste like it was made in house...sorta tasted like a mix. I guess it's personal preference but I like guacamole to taste fresh and like avocado. This tasted like garlic and had a weird consistency. The tacos came with a side of beans and rice, which were REALLY good.   The chips they give you tasted like they were from a bag and also not made in house.   Next time I think I'll try one of their salads."}
{"text":"I just recently tried this place for the first time. My boyfriend and I shared the Pizza Nortena, which was like heaven in my mouth. I love those fried chicken chimichangas with the spicy cream cheese sauce on them (pollo fundido I believe they are called) and I love pizza. This is basically pollo fundido on top of pizza. Sooooooo good, and gigantic. We had left overs, which tasted a-may-zing cold. The chips and salsa are delish too, and they aren't afraid to refill them for you, which is good for me because I like to spoil my din din by going to town on freebies.  The service here is also good. The servers are nice and attentive. And a big plus for me is that it is CLEAN. I cant even count how many times I have had Mexican food in a filthy restaurant. Now, don't get me wrong, I love hole in the wall places, but in a sit down place that charges normal, not hole in the wall prices, I don't want to swat at fruit flies while eating my pollo fundido. I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever received.  When asked about tortillas, Mercedes the server said get your own tortillas.  She was rude, unprofessional,  and very sarcastic.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Had the burrito lunch plate w/chicken.  Other than lots of meat it was nothing special.  Came with lettuce.  Any other add-ons come with an upcharge."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened when I was a kid. Best things on the menu: chicken taco salad (such tender, delicious shredded chicken & tons of it!), green corn tamale with green enchilada sauce & cheese (the best ever!), the appetizer chili con queso dip to go with your chips (so worth a calorie splurge), and, of course, the pollo con queso. Their guacamole is mediocre - save your calories for other menu deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery through doordash. Queso dip came in styro container straight from refrigerator. Wth??!!  Not the driver's fault, but that is ridiculous. Had to put in own bowl and microwave. Wouldn't have paid all that $$ for delivery, if I was going to have to do the heating and the dishes too. Ajo Al's = major fail!!"}
{"text":"I had a taco steak but it was so over cook that tasted like liver, really bad...  pico de gallo wasn't fresh. $12 (3 mini tacos, beans and rice.) Bloody Mary drink didn't have any presentation but it was good.$7 Really sorry but I don't think We are never going back."}
