{"text":"I came upon Bitondo's by chance many years ago, while sitting at a table across the street at The Monarch, watching a revolving door of people coming in and out. Tried it. Pizza hasn't been the same since. The 5 stars is for the pizza because I could care less about the decor or veal sandwiches. They're obviously doing something right if the place hasn't been renovated in 30 years and they still have a steady flow of clientele. In addition to the pepperoni pizza which you need to try (seriously...keep it simple - don't get fancy). The panzerotti is basically a giant brick of cheese, wrapped in dough and baked. So, amazing. Tip: ask for marinara sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough. Whenever I'm on College, I always make time for Bitondo's Pizzeria. 

Their $3 slices are thin crust, fresh, and of great value.

Cash only."}
{"text":"This review is only for their meatball sandwich, as thats the only thing I ordered from there.  Found them walking around the area.

Just no place here in Brooklyn like Bitondo's.  We do not have panzo's or spezzatino at all.  Even ordering is different.  Asked for a meatball parm hero, only to be asked hot or sweet.. (thats only sausage here).  Had no idea what was hot or sweet, so ordered sweet to play it safe.  Best damn sandwich I ever had in my life!!  They do not put peppers on meatballs here, and it is the missing link.

Automatic stop when I come up again.  Mangia, but sweet only..."}
{"text":"I live pretty close so I would love this place to be great. Unfortunately I have only been dissapointed in the food. The pizza is generally bland verging on tasteless, slices are greasy and dough undercooked, meat tastes cheap and oily. 

Panzarotti even more greasy with plenty of cheese and nothing else. 

Atmosphere is pretty poor. The place is falling apart and you have to wonder about hygiene in a place that looks so run down and dirty.  The signs/menu haven't changed in years and have long since faded. 

Sorry to say, go to one of the pizza franchises over this place, or anywhere else on College."}
{"text":"Favourite by the slice pizza joint in town.

For 3.75 you won't get more quantity anywhere else. Yes the restaurant isn't fancy, and yes the toppings are simple, but that's why it's so cheap.

The real star of the show is the panzerotti--6.75 on its own but you really need to splurge the extra dollar to get a side sauce. Pretty sure the secret ingredient in the sauce is salt, but this is pizza, not a health food store .

It's cheap, it's authentic, and it's got heart. I haven't been to anywhere else in the city with this sense of community (unless you count Martino's or Frank's Pizza, which I guess I do)."}

{"text":"It's worth the drive for likely the best pizza I've ever eaten in Toronto . Whenever I'm in the area and in mood for pizza, this is the place."}
{"text":"This is the best place for pizza--no joke, it is unreal. Been a fave since I was introduced to the place 3 years ago. 
I highly recommend this place, and cheese pizza is the best there. 
I think a large pizza is only $10-$12, very well priced, and will be the best pizza you have tried. 
*thumbs up*
FYI: cash only, and no delivery."}
{"text":"The best panzo I have ever had! Been eating here (when I can find the time to come down) for 30 years. 
Cheese only light on the sauce is the way to go!
YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!

The best slice in little Italy.

My kids and I go in all the time, they've  treated us like family from day one.

This city needs more places like this!!!"}
{"text":"I feel so alone. My husband loves this pizza. Coworkers have recommended it. Friends rave. It has an average of four stars. My opinion is...WTF?

I hate it. 

Sloppy, greasy, soggy pizza just does not appeal to me. The sauce is good, but that doesn't make up for the slop, grease, and sog. And the bland crust. That's right, I said it.

To be fair, (1) I am a crisp, thin-crust kind of gal; (2) every single person in the place (besides my husband and small children) is always eating the panzarotti, so maybe that's the true specialty here. Maybe the panzarotti is awesome. And if they served this mound of cheese inside a fried (baked?) pastry in portions smaller than a mailbox, I'd try it."}
{"text":"The beef sandwich and the panzerotti were good but nothing to write home about. Service is a little slow as it's a mom and pop but very popular. Not a lot of room to sit inside - definitely a take out kind of place."}
{"text":"I went to Bitondo's Pizzeria on a fluke and had my first panzarotti[1]. I'd seen signs for panzarotti at various pizza places in town but I wasn't sure what they were. (Pizza joints in NYC don't have them.) But, dang, it's pretty delish at Bitondo's. 

THE FOOD
Their panzarotti ($5.99 including tax) kind of look like deflated calzones with softer crusts, rich with olive oil. My first couple of bites were all fried dough but when I got to the filling, it was like striking gold; a stream of molten mozzarella mingling with tomato sauce was unearthed. My one complaint: While it was still warm from the heat box, I wish it were made fresh so that the crust would be crisper and less greasy and the cheese more fluid.

Their pizza ($2.75 a slice), however, was a let down---yet still leagues above the nastiness of Pizza Pizza/Domino's/[insert pizza chain here]. I asked for \"a slice\" and got one loaded with pepperoni[2]. It had been sitting under a heating lamp and the counter guy didn't crisp it up in the oven so the crust was a soggy bleh. But the pepperoni was the real deal; intensely porky, spicy and flavorful.

If you're a bitter-flavors junkie like me, get a can of Brio ($1.25). It's an Italian soda that tastes like Coke flavored with Campari. For the rest of you, they have a vintage Coca-Cola cooler filled with cans of the usual stuff.

They also have sandwiches and pizza by the pie available.

THE VIBE
It feels like the quintessential neighborhood take-out spot in Little Italy. The space is small with a few tables and chairs. Eat in and you can check out the Italian soccer photos and posters on the walls, or play a few games of Ms. Pacman (Yes, I said Ms. Pacman!) on the table arcade for 25 cents a pop.
=======================================
[1] Is it overly correct to use \"panzarotto\" for the singular?
[2] Isn't the standard slice just cheese?"}
{"text":"When I was living in Toronto I would go there with the wife and kids on Sundays after church.  Starting to get pricey.  Best Panz."}
{"text":"Mama Mia!  That's-a nice-a pizza pie-a!      I actually ate a panzeratti so I have no idea how the pizza tastes. The Panz was great though.  It was a piece of bread folded and fried with hot red sauce and delectable cheese inside.  The decor was authentic Italian with orange tiles and a painting on the window of the chef with a mustache.  My new favorite eatattoria!  Buona Notte!"}
{"text":"When I mentioned to a friend that I had never been to Bitondos about a year ago, it was like a cartoon look of shock on everyone's face.  Bitondos is the classic hole in the wall pizza joint, tucked away on a residential side street off of Little Italy.

When you walk in, it looks the way pizza places did in 1986.  There's a classic Player's cigarettes clock on the wall, as well as a few other vintage signs.  There's even a tabletop arcade version of Pac Man!  I half expect someone to turn on Michael Jackson on the radio and light up a cigarette at their table.  

The food, though, is amazing.  Minimalist but amazing.  The panzerotti is as good as you're going to find in town, as far as I'm concerned, and I will stick by that as a panzerotti enthusiast.  The side order of sauce you can get with the panzerotti tastes homemade and comes in a little styrofoam cup like you'd get a cup of coffee in at a hockey arena.  The individual slices of pizza are nothing to shake a stick at either.  Ordering and paying is a casual affair, with the molded plastic seats and 70s color scheme enough to satisfy whatever kitsch cravings you might be suffering from.  

The staff at Bitondo's are brusque but pleasant.  They might bark a \"whattayawant\" at you, but they will usually follow it up with a smile or a little joke.  If you're looking for a good slice or some authentic sauce, go check out Bitondos.  The price is certainly right."}
{"text":"Classic pizza place. Known it all my life. Great ready made large pepperoni slices to go. Very cheap. Friendly workers with a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"The BEST traditional pepperoni pizza in Toronto. They don't deliver, that's how good the pizza is; you have to seek it out like Link searching for Princess Zelda."}
{"text":"Live five doors down from this place and couldn't recommend it enough.

So far I've only sampled the pizza slice and having sampled it all across Toronto this is best by-the-slice place in the city.

Fine dining it is not but for a takeaway there are few others that come close.

Friendly service with a smile is also on hand at all times."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place literally since my mom was pregnant with me. It has the best veal sandwich and pizza in the city.  The veal is tender does not have too much breading and the sauce is pure nonna style. The pizza is thin crust and has great sauce and cheese. The ponzo is also off the hook. To truly enjoy it ask for a plate and sauce on top. Served this way it is a perfect balance of flavour. I have not had a single friend go there that was no not floored by the food. The place is old but as the saying goes don't judge a book by the cover.  For those who foneat veal the chicken cutlet sandwich is a great alternate. Warning this place is cash only."}
{"text":"Went there 35 Years ago. Place still looks the same. Pizza was great. Prices were most reasonable. The slice is huge compared to anywhere else. Whenever we are in that part of the city we always drive over to Bitondo's and order a party size,so we an freeze what we don't eat right away."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!! veal sandwich is amazing!  And no one has a better panzo!  If i could i would eat there everyday....."}
{"text":"This is actually an update about my comments about Cora's and Papa Ceo's.  I'm not sure about Papa Ceo's but I have now ordered whole pizzas from Cora's, and they're quite good.

Sorry Cora's."}
{"text":"Had heard about Bitondo's for some time, and was venturing off to San Francesco foods for a sandwich, only to realize Bitondo's was across the street. Two legendary Toronto sandwich shops across from each other, yet both have lasted decades. Interesting. 

So I decided since recently I had San Francesco, I decided to try the other. As I had heard great things about them.

No doubt a huge filling sandwich at a great price, but unfortunately, (don't know if it was the day or what) the veal was not as good as the hype I had been given. Plentiful yes, but overcooked and dry. Am ample sauce and cheese quantity could not mask it. It still was tasty, but when cooking veal, it needs to be soft, tender melt in your mouth, and this was not. 

Could have just been a bad day for this poor sandwich, so I will revisit for a second chance as it was not terrible, but it did not live up to the  hype I had heard. 

Friendly staff though, which also is a plus in this day and age."}
{"text":"After a solid 6 years of living in toronto I have finally found what just might be the BEST take out pizza in the city! Since I'm originally from Windsor, until I found Bitondo's everything paled in comparison (and frankly, really disappointed)! Look no further for quality toppings , perfect dough and freshness - this is your place."}
{"text":"Their pizza is awesome.

My thing about pizza is that I feel really disgusted after a greasy slice.  Pizzaiolo comes to mind in that regard (yet still good).

Bitondo's pizza on the other-hand is really clean.  Their tomato sauce is fresh and not too complex, very crisp and clean tomato flavour.  Their mozarella doesn't drip oil when baked.  Their dough is simple and crunchy once out of the oven.  I personally am a simple pepperoni, mushroom guy.

Overall, the pizza is awesome, it all works well together and you easily can distinguish the taste of each ingredient in your mouth.  Very very clean pizza and that's how I like it.

Their panzerotti's are the best I've tried so far.  Sided with tomato sauce, this gluttonous affair will have you oohing and aahing for more.  Very similar to how I feel about their pizza, except their panzo's are deep fried (yummy), yet still clean.

4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich was good, albeit a touch too salty. The owner was friendly, inviting and turned my order around quickly. 

The only criticism is that the place is dated and could use a cosmetic upgrade. Also, drink selection is limited and the place is cash only."}
{"text":"Probably can attribute about 8lbs of stomach mass to this place. 

I get the veal sandwich ($6! with tax!) - usually cut in half and spicy.

Sweet: just tomato sauce
Medium: 2 jalapeños
Spicy: 4 jalapeños

The sauce is not as good as the stuff across the street @ San Francesco's- but I go here because there's a bench outside to sit and eat, several (grimy) tables on the inside, and some sort of PONG game that costs a quarter to play.

Consistently consistent."}
{"text":"C'est connu de chez connu Bitondo's. N'étant pas sur l'avenue principale avoisinante, cette pizzeria est connue des habitants et habitués du quartier. Le service y est minimal et si vous y passez pour une tranche de pizza, ce sera une tranche au pepperoni. Vous pouvez passer commande pour autre chose bien entendu mais il faudra attendre : sandwich, pizza complète. C'est un peu gras, un peu salé, c'est pas du grand luxe mais bon c'est pas mal quand même !"}

Maybe the oldest pizza spots in Toronto good old fashion pizza.  The sliced are huge with a low price . This is old school pizza.
These days you see pizza with goat cheese spinach and even chicken thats nasty . Old school wins.....

 Pac-Man machine shout pure 60s relic. It's obvious the interior can't have changed much, and it's charming in its throwback"}
{"text":"I've been also coming to Bitondo's Pizzeria for many years. Steak and Veal sandwiches were great (Sweet, Medium, and Hot), along with the panzerotti and pizza slices, and we'd take them across the street to the Monarch Tavern (ground floor) for great, inexpensive drafts.

Fast forward a lot of years.

The Monarch is changed (only the 2nd floor - done like a sports bar) and the highlights of Bitondo's are no longer the sandwiches IMO. However, the panzerotti are still second to NONE. Along with the fresh pizza slices that are regularly being served. Mmm!

The retro 60s-70s furniture is cool to look at but it doesn't detract from the great food.

However, please note that parking is EXTREMELY limited, and the tickets on Clinton and surrounding streets are handed out on a regular basis. Be careful.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ha ha ha. Funny story about my most recent Bitondo's visit. After seeing a black cat in Yorkville, bad luck followed. The green P machine ate my ticket. I came to Little Italy to try P.G Cluck's famous fried chicken sandwich. They were out of bread. I went to veal place across from Bitondo's for a sandwich, they were out of buns! After complaining about the bread shortage in Toronto that night, I decided to give Bitondo's a second try. It was late around 9:30 pm, but the slices were hot and fresh! 

I ordered a pep slice and a chocolate milk $6.00. It was a huge slice, with great cheese and pepperoni. Cant ask for much more. Well, except for garlic dip which they didn't have. They only had marinara on deck, which made me forgiving because the place seemed old-school, authentic, and legit!"}
{"text":"ok. let's set it straight about bitondo's.  bitondo's reminds me of that pizza i used to buy as a teenager when my mom gave me $5 to buy a treat once and a while on a school day...  well the recipe hasn't changed at bitondo's - presumably it's the same pizza place that was there when i was a little girl.  it's not like new york pizza.  if you go there expecting new york pizza you will be disappointed.  but if you go there for a cheap snack with your friends - you'll be happy...  for under $5, you'll get a good size slice of pizza with a pop.  at least you get something to fill the belly - you know what i mean?  their panzos are over-priced - i was wondering why people were ordering them so i tried one and was utterly dismayed - it was so not worth it.  typically there stuff is lukewarm when served to you.  they make things beforehand and leave it in warm oven - so it's not fresh when they serve it to you. if you are a meat eater and want something hot you might want to try one of their sandwiches or order a whole fresh pizza..."}
{"text":"Was there September 2015 for a veal sandwich. The veal is thin and well breaded, but as you are eating the sandwich you discover fatty parts that are not chewable and have to be spit out or pulled out of the sandwich. For me, that ruins my appetite. Fatty parts should be removed as they are pounding it and breading it. There was not enough sauce on the sandwich so it was too dry. I had not been here in many years and forgot to order sauce on the side, but in my opinion I should not have to do this. Everything is extra, so if you want cheese or mushrooms prepare to pay and extra 75 cents to $1. With a beverage you can get lunch for under $10, depending on how many things you want to add to the sandwich. Honestly, I have had a much better sandwich at California Sandwiches for an extra few dollars. I will probably not make a special trip back for a veal sandwich, but may stop in for a slice since they looked delicious and everyone coming in was there for a slice. It is still a really busy place and it was very hot outside that day and their air conditioner is pathetic, so eating in is not a good option. Pop is NEVER cold in this place and hasn't been for the 20 years I've been going here."}
{"text":"This place by far is one of the most authentic, wholesome, quality, straight-up establishment you can rely on. I have eaten there several times and have had the pizza, panzorotti, and veal. ALL WERE GREAT, and HEAR ME when I say this... The Panzorotti is probably THE BEST IN TORONTO if not NORTH AMERICA! 

Simple But TRUE! Thank you for a place like this!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the abuse a $3.50 pizza 
 slice gets on this site.  This pizza is made exactly the way it is supposed to be.  It is not a fancy pizza place, it's a gloriously greasy, thin crust perfect slice.
Go somewhere else if you are looking for artisan sophisticated pizza.
Great place for a quick slice."}
{"text":"Average pizza. It's $3.25 for a slice of pepperoni pizza. Quite cheap. I don't like the topping and the crust. Not delicious at all. It's like chewing days old cured meat on a dough. I don't understand why they are among one of the best in Toronto. Toronto def has better pizza places. I prefer Marchellos's or Taverniti's pizza. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"As I've written before, I feel that to truly judge a pizza, it should be at it's simplest; plain cheese (See Ray's, NYC), and straight from the oven.  I'll definitely have a slice when on the run, but I won't judge a pizza place by a slice that's been sitting a while.

Jonathan K and I called in our order, and headed over.  We went for 1/2 plain cheese, and 1/2 mushrooms and (not very) hot peppers.  It was promised for 25 minutes, but was ready in about 15.  We got there right at noon, moments before the student rush.

I liked this pie a lot.  It was VERY similar to Danforth Pizza House.  Real cheese, a nice tomato sauce and a traditional crust.  I also like the authenticity of this little hole in the wall.

I'll be back.

NB.  This was noon, remember, and they ONLY had pepperoni slices.  Maybe that's all they do."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.

Food ordered: meatball sandwich, pepperoni slice, panzerroti.

The sandwich was good. Soft bread, lots of meatball (although one large meatball sliced rather than smaller meatballs all lined up), and a sauce with a kick. I wasn't expecting the jalapeno slices, but I removed them once I knew they were there.

The slice was a good slice. Not too much cheese, a good amount of pepperoni, and not too droopy. It's also huge, like a quarter of a full pie.

The panzerotti was also good. The cheese was melty and the whole thing was at a good temperature.

The downsides: the panzerotti was a bit greasy for my tastes, although it is deep fried and really, grease is to be expected in such cases. I'd appreciate some veggie options (salads, veggie sandwiches, etc.), but I won't hold that against them too much as this is a sandwich and slice place, not a full service restaurant. 

The service was fast (the only thing that had to be made was the sandwich) and the dining room is serviceable. The music was a bit loud to my tastes, but considering most of the customers are taking food to go, ambiance isn't at the top of their list.

Overall it's worth going and we'll probably go again the next time we get a craving for a slice."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Little Italy! This pizzeria is off the beaten path but makes the best panzo I've ever had / the only one I've ever craved. 
Order it with a cup of extra tomato sauce and enjoy every deep fried, saucy, cheesy bite."}
{"text":"For those of you who've been following my reviews for the past few months, you know I have been making some pretty bold claims about the best PANZO in the entire GTA (Toronto and surrounding areas). For those uncertain what I'm talking about, I will leave searching my past reviews up to you because this is all about Bitondo's.

A friend made the sacrilicious statement to me once that Bitondos was the best pizza/panzo joint anywhere - a comment to which I took personal offence with. So we made a pact that I would show her mine, if she showed me hers (pizza parlour). A few weeks back I introduced her to my fav spot outside the city, I watched her eyes roll in the back of her head as a small moan of satisfaction escaped her lips. She admitted it was good but stated I would need to try her place before a consensus could be reached.

Fast forward to this past Saturday night, College Street Festival, my friend and I had partaken in several $6 Martinis and were feeling no pain as we milled around with other Festival patrons in the street. As our night drew to a close we got the after bar munchies and my friend demanded that we finish our Panzo wager. I agreed with little resistance.

Walking a short distance down Clinton we found the little pizza shop nestled among the houses of the local neighbourhood. Dimly lit and apparently looking the same as it did in 1968 (the original PacMan machine is the only update since 1986). It was bumping even at 12:30am with people ordering pies and sitting on the street out front to chow down. 

The plastic lawn orange lawn furniture and old school Coca Cola cooler didn't deter me from my goal. Consume mass quantities of PANZA!

We decided to share one panzo between us, a mistake, as the moment we cut the deep fried bad boy in half, a flood of molten cheese and sauce began to pour out in waves like liquid MAG-MA!

I can honestly say I have never eaten something so cheesy. Each time I took a bite the ropes of cheese that pulled from this delicacy required me to wrap it around my finger at least 10 times.....OH EM GEEEEE - (I am drooling again).

The SAWCE.........yes folks its going to happen.....was BAWSE. The dough was beautifully cooked. But the cheese.......ohhhhh the cheese, there was so much cheese *single tear*.

I couldn't tell you what the price was I paid that night but I know that I woke up the next morning a la The Hangover, unsure what I had done the night before, however knowing that I had cheated on my hometown steady..... and loved every minute of it.

Bitondo's is not better...just different, and anytime I am in the city I will gladly cheat again and again. 

I guess the only question I need to ask is if Ashley Madison delivers Pizza?"}
{"text":"I have not had pizza as good as Bitondo's anywhere in Toronto. Like David M. suggested, a good pizza should be able to stand alone without any toppings. Bitondo's does this. For me, it's all about the cheese and the cheese here is gooey and very flavourful. The panzoes are amazing, especially when fresh. I don't get here often enough but when I do, I order at least 4 slices and a couple panzoes and keep them in the fridge for a day or two (if I'm lucky). Dang. I want some now..."}
{"text":"Average pizza, average toppings. We still have half a party size pizza in our fridge that I'm probably going to toss. I'm pretty sad about it because this place is close to the house I'm staying in, so I was hoping it would become my local pizza joint. Alas. And it's cash only, which is not my cup of tea. 

Maybe I need to try their veal sandwich instead."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews, I was excited about bringing our groom and his friends here before his big day.  It was underwhelming to say the least.  No A/C, claustrophobic space, and a rude woman at the register.  Maybe she was just having a bad day.  Either way, after waiting 30 min, the pizza was meh...soggy, ingredients falling off, and a weak crust.    Other this place being a famous relic, I don't really understand the big deal.  I was going to give 2 stars but having folks in our crew who don't eat pork being forced to buy a full pizza bumps this place down to 1 star.  Goodbye Bitondo, I won't be missing you."}
{"text":"Best panzo in TO. Hidden Jem. Wish they had delivery but my waistline is happy they don't"}
{"text":"Delicious. No nonsense thin crust pizza. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Went back and tried the cheese panzerotti, which was great. Get some extra sauce with it."}
{"text":"Went to Bitondo's for the first time today. I ordered a pizza slice, panzorotto, 3 veal sandwiches, one meatball sandwich, and two dried sausages. The kids loved the pizza slice and panzorotto, the sandwiches went over well.  I would recommend you get medium or hot because the mild veal was a bit bland.  The service was friendly and super fast. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"4 stars average?
Wtf

I have low standards for pizza in Toronto after trying several places, but have to say this place is terrible. 

Nothing was good. The crust was bad. The toppings were bad. And it tasted like it had been sitting there for hours (and I went during the lunch hours). 

Cash only 

Btw reviews seem to be outdated. Slice is now $3.5. Even that is too much for this stuff. I'd rather eat a slice of bread."}
{"text":"For take out pizza Bitondo's is the best, forget Pizza Pizza, Domino's, Pizza Hut...for value and quality you can get a great large Mama Brava Pizza for like 12-13 bucks.  The sauce makes it great and authentic.  You can taste the garlic and basil, such a great sauce.  The crust and sauce, to me, make the pizza.  The crust can be a little tasteless at times, but definitely NOT a deterrent.  Their pepperoni pizza is the bomb (i had to go old skool for them...the bomb...lol)."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never posted a review for Bitondos! 

I've come here many dozens of times, tried almost everything, and got to say if you're looking for a veal sandwich, an old-school jumbo pizza slice, or especially a deep-fried panzerotti, this is a truly great spot.

Parking is tricky, being in a busy residential neighborhood, and atmosphere is non-existent, unless, like me you love old school Neighbourhood greasy-spoon pizza joints run by the family and pumping out delicious food!

For the uninitiated, make sure you get your Panzerotti deep fried, and absolutely, positively, order extra sauce on the side, because while it will be loaded with tons of cheese and your chosen toppings, the sauce inside is merely a tease.

Pizza slices are very good, but, like any pizza slice, make sure you ask for them extra-well-done and (re)heated up very hot, they're not nearly as good if they are rushed, and I've had a few.

Italian sandwiches are also very solid, and I would put only Abruzzo in Richmond Hill slightly ahead of Bitondos as far as making two of the truly great panzerotti, here in the GTA."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in Toronto- hands down. Walking in and seeing the dough being made in the front window- and then the amazing customer service of the young girl on cash means it was always going to be a good experience. Also love the old school feeling of the place- and the drinks cooler!"}
{"text":"THIS is the ultimate place to go for pizza, panzo & veal. Every other place is second best, there is no contest .... anyone who says different hasn't got refined taste buds. This ain't California's \"Big Bunch of Slop on a bun\" - Everything is a pure treat here.... try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"I can see Bitondo's from my window as I type this. I'd say half the traffic on my street is due to Bitondo's. This is the spot for a good ol' greasy slice of pizza or a meatball sub. The shop furnishings have gone unchanged for 30 years: there's a Ms. Pac Man sit-down game in there. The hand-painted menu on the window reads as follows:
*SPAGHETTI
*LASAGNA
*RAVIOLI
*SPEZZATINO
*PANZAROTTI
*PIZZA

The panzarotti is pretty much just a massive lump of deep fried cheese ($5). Oh dear god, it's the size of a human stomach and it's awesome. I need to order a side of tomato sauce for dipping ($1), because the cheese is too dense otherwise. Despite my proximity, I allow myself a Bitondo's panzo about twice a year. This only happens when I'm drunk and unconcerned about the 4000 calories per serving."}
{"text":"The best Panzo in all of toronto by far. The light sauce is perfect, the cheese is very fresh and very tasty! perfect cheese! Very chewy the panzo is made with perfection. Had a pepperoni slice and it was great also! This place is awesome best Panzo in Toronto and good pizza."}
{"text":"Great price, great taste. Was referred by a friend and come here every chance I get. Usually get a slice of pepperoni or a panzo."}
{"text":"We're back on the HUNT for Toronto's BEST! Stop #4 of the pizza pie tour: Bitondo's Pizzeria

We left the pandemonium of Caribana to venture into Little Italy for some pizza. After starting to question our directions since we found ourselves in a residential area, we eventually made it to Bitondo's, which for whatever reason has chosen to setup shop in a house. Bitondo's has \"neighbourhood joint\" written all over it, plus you get the feel that they've been serving pies for years. They've got a couple seats and tables, plus some benches outside, so bringing a small group is a-ok.

Instead of grabbing the usual pizza, we dabbled with panzerotti. The waitress and Facebook spoke confidently of these guys, so my excitement was high. They are made ready to order, but thankfully still taste plenty fresh. When you order the standard panzerotti, Bitondo's keeps it super simple and serves you marinara sauce and mozzarella nestled into a pizza dough envelope. It's essentially what a cheap flavour Pizza Pocket grows up into when it's a mature flavour adult. Things get a little out of hand though when you come to grips with the portion size. This thing is pretty damn big, and heed my warning; this will likely be the most cheese that you'll have consumed in a day in your life! When it comes to flavour, you'll have a satisfying time enjoying the warm marinara, the initial allure of the mozzarella, and the basic, but fitting pastry, but then either two thirds in or shortly following the meal you will pay for your somewhat irresponsible choice. I'm not saying that I didn't like it, but damn... I dare say you can have too much cheese. Good luck walking at a brisk pace afterwards. That being said, if you're walking around Little Italy after a couple pints, head straight for Bitondo's! This has the potential to be a drunk food masterpiece.

I've been told that you can call in ahead and custom order whatever you want in your panzerotti. I would definitely suggest this, because if you have somehow missed it, there's no meat in the standard version. And if you do happen to go, get some extra marinara sauce on the side to satisfy your dipping sauce needs."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential old school pizza joint. When I think of pizza as comfort food, Bitondo's is the first place that comes to mind. The place is a hole in the wall - plastic furniture, video consoles from the 80s, and dingy bathrooms down dangerous stairs, but that is somehow part of the odd charm.
I can't remember my first Bitondo's pizza, but fortunately, little has changed. The surly guy taking out his frustrations in life by hand pounding each pizza is still there as well. The menu has expanded from the original four ingredients - pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and anchovies - to offer a half dozen more choices. But the pizza, oh, the pizza, is still just as good. It starts with the crust, with the perfect balance of crunch and chew. The sauce tastes like pizza sauce should, balancing acid and sweet without the thick jammy consistency chains like to use. The toppings are fresh and they top it with enough cheese to generate that burst of hot oil that burns the top of your mouth on the first bite.
But maybe even better than the pizza is the panzerotto. What is it about deep fried dough that is sooooo good? Their version is classic - just loads of cheese with just enough seasoned fresh tomato sauce to make your tastebuds sing. Beware the slow leak, or worse, the gusher of burning hot juices!
Come here for the awesome food, questionable ambience, great value and time warp back to the 70's when pizza ruled and nobody asked about calories."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza and the panzerottis are delicious!!!

But if I had to choose, I am ALWAYS in the mood for a panzerotti. The dough is to die for and the filling is sooo yummy

It's always busy around lunchtime/ when they open, so that's the best time to go because everything is fresh and hot and constantly being refilled!"}
{"text":"Great, SIMPLE Pizza, similar to Brooklyn NY Pizza.  An excellent veal sandwich the size of my head.  

Visiting Toronto Western Hospital and had time for lunch @ 12-15 minute walk from Dundas/Bathurst on a residential street in Little Italy. 

We forgot to hit a bank machine and when we first popped in, the staff directed us to an ATM at the bar across the road.  We just went to College Street a block North and there was a CIBC another block West.  

So we came back and ordered veal sandwich and a pizza slice with a couple of Brio Chinottos, one of my favourite pops that's hard to get in North Bay. 

Pizza was already made, so that & the Brios were up right away.  
Huge slice of pepperoni, done NYC or Brooklyn style.  Nice sauce, just enough cheese, nice amount of pepperoni.  An amazing, simple slice, which is the way pizza should be. 

Veal Sandwich delivered to our table in a paper bag, wasn't sure what to expect.   Opened it up and it was on a kaiser roll the size of my head. 
What I liked about this sandwich is it wasn't sitting around on a steam table...the veal was freshly fried and hot.   A lot of meat with a nice tomato sauce and I ordered \"hot\" which meant hot banana peppers on the bottom under the meat.  Excellent sandwich. 

If you want a quick, no fuss lunch, this little out of the way place is a great spot."}
{"text":"What a great place! As if the steady stream of customer's on Canada Day or any other given night wasn't enough of indication, Bitondo's has a noted following among Toronto pizza afficinado's. Good herby tomato sauce, chewy wide slices and plus that arterie clogging deep fried 'panzo are all key reasons why this joint deserves a look see. It's best to get the panzo when it's fresh and hot, so you can enjoy the hot thick fried cheese with some of that sweet tomato sauce on top. Sandwiches aren't so key here best to head over to San Fran's or California's down the street but if you're in the area and need some 'za this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Exceptional Panzos !! Fresh, Filling, Tasty, and Authentic. I cant wait to go back !!! 

Its a good take out place that is very reasonably priced ! Mom-n-Pop type of owned place with a few tables available for seating."}
{"text":"Got the sausage and I asked for the spicy but there was really only 2 bites that had a ton of spice on it - overall though it was delicious.  Generally I compare to Cali's because for me that's the benchmark because they do something amazing with their sausage that no one else does.  This place was no different.  The sausage wasn't as good but it was still delicious.  Lots of cheese and lots of sloppy sauce.  The way it should be.  Size was decent but gotta give props to the price.  Sausage with cheese and mushrooms and a drink for just under $9.... fantastic.  If I'm in the area again, I would definitely think about coming here again... but with Cali's around the corner, we'll see."}
{"text":"Really good veal sandwich, awful doughy pizza slice"}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I can't help getting their delicious, stringy panzerotti's!!! With marinara sauce, tons of mozza, you just can't go wrong. It makes for the perfect 11pm meal :)"}
{"text":"Why didn't I know about this place sooner?  It's definately a dive of a place.  Plastic lawn chairs, broken video poker, old tile and \"musty old building smell\" make this a no go zone for first dates, business lunches and fussy people.  A look around at the clientele tells me all I need to know - loads of Italians and a lot of people drinking Brio.  Another look around yields an old Coke cooler (which is now broken...), and a simple illuminated menu.  They do everything from veal sandwiches, pizza, pasta and panzerottis.

I stuck with a simple slice of pepperoni pizza.  The crust is pretty much perfect, with a lot of chew on the flat areas, and crispy where the toppings end.  The sauce is swimming with basil flavours and is slightly sweet, but still tastes very tomato-ey.  The toppings are generous - holy crap, my slice was drowned in cheese and topped with slightly thicker slices of pepperoni.  The pepperoni tastes like real meat - very porky, spicy and rich.  The sheer size of the slice is something to behold as well - it is comparable to New York style pizza, you k know, the ones that you have to fold the slices in order to eat?

It struck me that the panzo(s)/calzones are something to marvel at.  A full table of four ended up ordering one each.  They look perfect.  Dark brown (like most spray tanners these days), and oozing a huge amount of cheese!  And not to mention the size - much of it covers a plate.  Wow...very different from the standards heralded by \"big pizza\" companies like Pizza Pizza and Pizza Hut.

The prices are very reasonable and you can create your own pizza pies as well.  (They do have a limited choice of toppings, but that's better than too many to keep fresh.)  For my late lunch, it cost me $4.25.  $3.00 for the slice, and $1.25 for the can of pop!  Yum!

A great place to get a pizza fix and harden your arteries as well."}
{"text":"Place has gone downhill. Slices are now more expensive and not fresh. How can you charge almost four bucks for a nasty congealed cold slice? 

Won't be going back unfortunately. No pride in their food remains.

Go to Fresca pizza for a margherita slice you can count on."}
{"text":"Being raised in Italian culture I've sampled much pizza. Bitondo's is by far the Best Pizza in Toronto.  I have driven from Barrie to get a pie to fulfill the craving, that's how good it is.  My wifes homemade is still better though."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get a panzerotti! Ever since I was a little girl, I would always make a stop here for lunch, when I would come to visit my grandparents. The quality of the food has been consistent and they are just as good today as they were when I was a little girl 25 years ago. The only thing that sucks is that they charge you $1 for a side of extra sauce. The place isn't exactly a cheap hole in the wall restaurant, so charging an additional $1 for a little container of sauce I think is steep. However, the quality in their food is solid."}
{"text":"Tondo's has been rumoured to prefer slices of the same gender, and also to prefer slices of the opposite gender. It's now been confirmed that Tondo's likes both, hence the new name BiTondo's.

Unfortunately these beloved slices at $3 are really not very delicious. Maybe by Toronto standards, this big, cheesy, tasteless slice is excellent. But coming from Buffalo where we are utterly spoiled with pizzerias, this was both inferior and less imaginative. And it's hard to be less imaginative than basic Buffalo pizza.

So I'm not a big fan of the slices, but I am a fan of local businesses and I appreciate that Toronto seems to love this place. I can sort of see why, but it's not on my top list at all. Average.

I should say, Bitondo's is a \"Bit\" average."}
{"text":"Mind blowing panzerotto, the place has been around for a long time, enough time to be a restaurant in the middle of a residential area."}
{"text":"First time visit.  Had two slices and found them pretty tasteless.  It was crowded and the panzerotti seemed to sell more than the slices so maybe that is the big deal about this place.  But I just don't see it.
The staff was very friendly and the restaurant had a real cool Italian feel to it but man, I was truly not fond of the slices.  They were greasy and the crust didn't have the texture I would expect from such a top-rated establishment.  Maybe I had them on an off day....will have to try again.
But for now all I can offer is 2 for a real mediocre slice."}
{"text":"An authentic North American/Italian pizzeria, this joint serves up some deliciously droopy pizza.  Unlike the chains, a Bitondo's Large is, in fact, large.  You can feed 2-3 (maybe 4 if you stretch it) people with one of these pizzas.  The Pizzas are very reasonably priced, and it's always worth the walk to this off-college spot.  However, make sure you phone ahead, because you'll often have to wait for the pizza.  They do a good job of telling you how long it'll be (and their ETAs are accurate.)  One thing to be aware of is that this place does not deliver, which really amplifies the local-ness of the spot.  

Unfortunately, I cannot attest to the quality of the Panzerotti or the Veal Sandwich, but everything I've ever heard about them tells me that it's magical.  I just really love their pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is hit and miss at this place.

When they are on their game that day, the pizza is top of the line.

On the other days, it is brutal to a point that the slice is tossed out before finishing.

Not sure why the huge spread in quality but if you get them on a good day, you will be impressed.

If only they were consistent, they would be the best pizza joint in town but they lack of consistency gives them 3  stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for pizza in TO. I prefer Pizza Gigi's sauce, however their crust is perfect.  Nice char, crisp and chewy, with a nice nutty flavour that you don't need any dipping sauce. I usually order a whole pie rather than a slice, because the pizza comes out fresher and juicier.  My 12\" pie cost me only $14 (incl tax).  It beats franchises any day!"}
{"text":"Great fresh slice. good price. Check this place out if you have the chance"}
{"text":"just great food - been eating there for over 40 yrs - its all good !"}
{"text":"Went back again for their ravioli and tortellini. Tortellini was nothing special but the ravioli was amazing. This is becoming one of my favorite spots to eat because I live nearby. Still haven't tried their meatball sandwich but plan on doing it really soon."}
{"text":"Nice discovery, good thing about Toronto, you are always finding 'new' places to eat.
This is a bit off College St, not necessarily a place you would normally be walking past.
I would give 5 stars; no debit/atm (had to go across street, up the stairs to a bar for atm; annoying in 2017, just get a debit machine, it's quicker/easier).  The decor/interior is 'slightly' charming but mostly run-down/dumpy looking; needs new chairs, seating.  Great spot for a reno, the patrons and staff would probably appreciate it.
Panzo is quick, ready and excellent; $6.75.  Slices look good, they can get busy.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Holy mother of veal sandwiches. This has taken over the #1 spot for veal sammich, shifting Primo Veal to #2 (I'm sorry, kind man serving me all this time...it was inevitable!).

The sammich cost me around 8 bucks, it was so fresh, so big - the bun was softer than an angel feather and the meat tasted like it was specially tailored to please my taste buds.

The service was nice and quick, the place itself is grimy but who the hell cares...the bathrooms were gross BUT I did find a can of coke on the floor. So...free coke? I'm disgusting, I know.

My friends all has pizza, so I obviously took a couple chunks off of theirs and YUM. Just as good. They only take cash, I think? So bring some. Indulge. And then go to Cafe Diplo to wash it down with sangria. xoxo"}
{"text":"Have since become vegan, and even getting the panzo without cheese is freakin' delicious. Jus' sayin'"}
{"text":"So far the best no-fuss, non-gourmet, New York style pizza I've had in Toronto. I knew there were a lot of Italians in our city but I could never find a great slice until I walked into this hole in the wall of Bitondo's.

This place is nestled nicely off of college and in a quiet residential neighborhood. Approaching the establishment you see old Italian dudes making pizza in the window, good sign. Walking inside you are greeted by what can only be described as a 60's nightmare. Ceiling tiles probably full of asbestos, 60's orange circular wall paper that is peeling, sun faded and well aged menu sign, Display case full of brio and sodas, a really old Coke cooler that is really awesome, a touch screen game you see at bar counters, bright orange plastic chairs, white 60's table (you'll know what I mean when you see it), weathered brown floor tiling, and a SIT DOWN Ms. Pac Man! That old ass sit down Ms. Pac Man alone should make you wanna walk over RIGHT NOW!

Service feels like you're in someone's, 60's decorated, Italian home. People greet you smiling, it's uncomfortably busy and crowded, the air is slightly humid from all the people,  there's the weird uncle giving you the eye while making pizza like you owe him money, the cousin you never really got along with is grabbing pizza, panzos, pastas, and sandwhiches for everyone because she doesn't really socialize, the kids are sitting around Ms. Pac Man trying to win an impossible game, and Nonna is somewhere making everything that's not pizza and making it damn well. Home sweet home. 

Now for the good stuff. The pizza! The pizza here is amazing! Simple and balanced. Sauce is a little sweet but still acidic from the tomatoes, the cheese is just the right amount, the crust is amazingly thin but sturdy and has a nice crispy outside but slightly chewy inside. Amazing stuff they have here. I prefer to order a pizza when I go here as SOMETIMES the slices are too chewy from sitting there, the cheese isn't as gooey, and the sauce dries out a little but I think that's only when you go in at off hours. Bring some friends and order a whole pie and get it a little well done so you get a slight char on the bottom, then you got yourself a New York style pizza.

The Panzerotti is fantastic. Deep fried goodness! Doughy but crispy, cheesy, saucy, and surprisingly not as greasy as I would expect. It's damn heavy but man is it good. if you're with a group of people definitely grab one of these, you can even share as these babies are huge. At times I've seen the panzos sitting in the display case under a heat lamp during rush hours for dinner. Best to get them fresh. Eat in or on the benches outside but be sure to get the extra sauce for the panzo as it makes the experience that much better. When you order out they come in a paper bag, but I don't know if they throw in some sauce in a container, couldn't hurt to ask if you gotta book it.

Overall, the pizza is amazing. No fuss and simple. Prices are great too at $5.75 a panzerotti and $2.75 a gigantic slice, Bitondo's knows how to give you the most bang for buck.

NOTE: No delivery, call ahead to pick up as it gets ridiculously busy."}
{"text":"Bitondo's panzerotti's are reallllly good.  Like, really good. So good. I've never had a panzerotti like theirs anywhere else.  They are deep fried and stuffed with enough cheese, grease and calories to provoke a heart attack, but it's so worth it. If you're not on a mission for a nights worth of heartburn and bloat, you may want to share one with someone and supplement the rest of your meal with pizza (a tip from the wise).

Whenever family comes to visit they always have to pass by Bitondo's at some point while they're here. The veal sandwiches are also worth mentioning too -- not as good as California's but sometimes you can't wait 40 minutes for a sandwich. They have seating here for about 10, but most take theirs to-go. They're always busy so call ahead for your order if you want pizza...usually takes 20-25 minutes. Panzerotti's you can just come pick-up whenever you want as they're made in advance."}
{"text":"Bitondo's has apparently been around for a long time. I recently had my first experience.

They serve a rather large slice of pepperoni pizza for 3.75.  Add a Brio cola and your total is 6$. (5$ if you opt for a can of pop).

The pizza is good, if a bit bland, yet they have chilli flakes available.

They are bringing the pizzas straight out of the oven right before your eyes here. Be sure to make time to eat your pizza here. The place (from the table-top Miss PacMan machine to the orange plastic chairs) evokes a strong sense of a by-gone era when Little Italy was a lot more Italian."}
{"text":"Panzo, Panzo Panzo!!!!  I was here a few weeks ago in the evening and it was the best one I've had yet.  Fresh out of the fryer with sauce all over.  I love this place more than my wife."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, old school Toronto Italian food joint, how can you go wrong. Best ponzos in the city hands down ."}
{"text":"Bittondo's is legit. Everything is cheap and overall good value. They sell pizza, panzerotti, pasta, and sandwiches. I have tried them all and have not yet been disappointed. If you're in the mood for consuming a million calories in the form of deep fried dough and cheese, have a panzerotti because they are so good. The service is always friendly and fast. One of the best take out places!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here really by accident while trying to get directions to a certain other place and it was so busy and smelled so good that I had to try they're pizza. I had a pepperoni slice and it was huge! Their \"slice\" is almost like two slices. The pizza was good and the I loved the crust but it wasn't  the best pizza I've had. It was worth the stop though and the you can tell that this place has been around for a long time. The staff was friendly and even though I've had better pizza, I'm glad I stopped here and gave it a chance."}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza and pasta spot just off of College Street. The pizza is simple, delicious, and refreshingly unpretentious. Service is fast and friendly. There is seating inside and some benches outside, and lots of nonalcoholic drink options. I'm very much looking forward to trying the pasta!! Cash only, but you won't need much."}
{"text":"If you can find this place then you're in luck. 

Basic panzerotti and pizza slices just like you'd expect from a corner shop in Brooklyn.

A Toronto classic!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Etobicoke around the Queensway/Parklawn area and I would travel to Bitondo's just to get d \"panz.\" I got my wife hooked to the food and when she was pregnant (twice) she would send me to Bitondo's because she was craving. Fast forward to today, I now live in the Don Mills/Overlea area and someday's when the craving is bad for me for a \"panz\" I'll drive to to freakin' Bitondo's that how good this place is."}
{"text":"We have been coming to bitondo's since we were young. It's a very classic Italian pizzeria. I recommend the panzorotti with a side of sauce (key). If you are used to franchise restaurant panzorottis, then prepare to have your mind blown."}
{"text":"The best pepperoni slice you can get in the city - sauce is FANtastic, crust is perfect and it is cooked to perfection!  And....all this for only $3 including taxes???  It's worth the trek there!"}
{"text":"Pretty good \"dirty\" pizza, if you don't know what dirty pizza is it's basically just good old fashion greasy pizza normally from places that just make old fashion pizza none of that pizza with chicken and artichoke crap... This place is just plan old fashion pizza which is becoming more and more rare in Toronto's downtown core as hipsters take over. 
This place is certainly family run, the 90 year old man who makes the pizzas went outside to shovel snow in just a tee shirt and said he didn't realize he wasn't wearing a coat, the girl who worked there was sharing stories this place is 100% family run and it's awesome.
Obviously it isn't the best pizza, but it's cheap and good if your looking for some classic pizza that's nothing fancy just pepperoni and cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Greasy, sloppy, and Delicious!!! Stopped in for a slice recently and returned within a few days it was that good!! Its a bit of a throwback to getting a traditional large thin slice!!! Takes me back to high school!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Bitondo's.  It's been a while since I've been there.

It had been a busy lunch time for them ... they'd run out of pizza and ponzos (calzones).  I got the last slice of pizza (whoohoo!) and there was a 15 minute wait for more.

My pizza slice was yummy!  The next batch of slices were coming out of the oven when I left."}
{"text":"This place is legendary, especially among older Torontonians. I have been here several times and know what to expect when I order. 

The pizza is good and cheap! (Obviously for the size of the establishment and price you should not expect truffle oil to soak your organic Chia seed spelt flour crust into. Lol) Bitondos is a local pizza place with a family oriented staff. The party size pizza are about $20. each, so if you're feeding a larger group, it's an excellent deal! 

Here's the deal: 
CALL AHEAD! I'd say at least half an hour because it is always full or people and getting g other phone in orders ready.  
CASH ONLY! go in with cash in hand or you'll be stuck running across the street to a bank machine that has a pretty high fee. 

Otherwise pretty straight forward.  Lots of cheese on every pizza, supreme only has 3 toppings, and I doubt anything is organic."}
{"text":"Had bitondos the other night since I haven't had anything all day. The veal is my fave and I always order it with cheese and mushroom. It is price really good compare to their competitors. 
I've tried their pizza slice and it was not as great, probably cause it was sitting there for a while, even reheating it. I was disappointed and wish I order a veal sandwich instead.
Never had the calzone/panzo yet, though I was told that I can customize it by calling ahead which is good. Their standard panzo is just cheese.

The atmosphere is kind of a dive, renovation would be nice. They do have seating (lawn chair) with a couple of tables to dine in for those who want to eat in.

Be wary with parking Infront of the place, parking enforcement frequent the area and would ninja you with a hefty ticket.

If you are in the little italy, go check it out and order a veal. Simply delish and the price is great."}
{"text":"You definitely don't find many old school stores like this and it's welcome. The food is good, perfect for lazy night takeout. The panzerotto's are stuffed to the brim with cheese, but i'd advise asking for tomato sauce on top additionally. Makes it that much more enjoyable. The pizza was by far the best. The veal sandwich is great, only comment i have is they don't dip the veal in tomato sauce like many other places."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, but this place is really all about the panzarotti ($5): a giant pocket of perfect dough, with amazing tomato sauce, and tons of mozzarella. It's almost ridiculous how much cheese is in a Bitondo's panzarotti, it just oozes out when you bite in. I've taken some people here that complain the panzas are too greasy and heavy. So, if that's not your thing, you might want to steer clear.

I'm pretty sure nothing about this place has changed since it opened several decades ago. And, that's exactly how I like it. When you have something that works don't mess with it. If you're looking for something quick, cheap, and amazing avoid the overpriced, trendy places on College and walk a block south to Bitondo's."}
{"text":"My rating isn't really set in stone. I feel like I should give Bitondo's another whirl and order a fresh pie. I ended up just popping in quickly for a slice of pepperoni, and I found it pretty average. If they had even popped it into the oven for a minute I feel like it would've been a far better experience, but unfortunately I got a tepid slice with chewy cheese. I feel like they might be able to redeem themselves to at least a 4.

Extra points for the vibe though. Very chill, kind of retro, table-top video game. Cool spot."}
{"text":"VIBE
This place feels like my Maltese grandmother's patio area. 1. there are Mediterranean tiles on the walls (who does that after 1987?) 2. there is plastic lawn furniture as tables. 3. There is a Pacman game (ok, my grandmother didn't have that. She's not that cool) 4. and a coca cola ice box (ok, she didn't have that either....just go with it. \"Take it and Go...\" --Russel Peters reference). It gets busy at lunch and in an instant. 

WE ATE 
Good ol' pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni didn't seem completely cooked but that cheese...mmm. The crust was meh. Maybe I'm not a crust person. 
I washed it down with a coke. Great lunch. Great day. And very affordable at $10 for a small pizza which was perfect split between two people. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Bit Bit BITE. Yummy. I like its unassuming location south of College on Clinton. Seriously, take it....and go."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE PIZZA. Pasta tasted like a child made it. Service was friendly but slow, and we also encountered this crazy woman patron who got hammered and proceeded to talk everyone's ear off about nonsense. Yikes."}
{"text":"Old school pizza with what was thin crust in the 80's but is now more like thick crust for those who love Margerita style pizzas.

This is not Libretto, this is a pizza from a kinder, gentler time when there was lots of sauce, cheese and pepperoni on a slice.

Tip: get a container of the sauce that is meant for those greasy deep fried Panzerotti and dip your folded slice in it instead.  Delish!

Some rave about the panzo but I prefer the slices.

I tried ordering a full pizza once, and like Evelyn said, it wasn't nearly as good.  The crust was way too thick and toppings didn't stay on.  It was as if it came from a different shop!

Never tried the veal because I won't stray from California sandwiches veal which is just around the corner. and the lineups there don't lie, best Veal in the city."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times just keep forgetting to check in. Amazing food here and there is no skimping out of any sort!
Big slices, gooey panzo's and best of all it's really cheap!
I'm actually going again this week for another Panzo and slice, it's that great.

Seating is not bad depending what time you go, a few times I've been it's like a grudge match to get a seat because it's such a popular spot lol

You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I tried the fried cheese panzerotto yesterday with their marinara sauce for dipping! I am telling you I felt like I was transported to  heaven. It was one of the most amazing things I've put in my mouth. 

They have been in the same location for 40 years. I know this panzerotto will haunt my dreams till I get my fix again."}
{"text":"Amazing divey pizzeria that looks like it's been here for decades. Amazing pizza and panzanellas, also can order olives and homemade sausage to take-away. Havent tried the pastas or sandwiches, but all looks pretty good. Love the old bloke manning the pizza ovens and the friendly staff. A great way to end a boozy night!"}
{"text":"This place brings back memories from 18 years ago. The pizza, price and people are all top notch. Haven't had better pizza since 18 years ago. They are celebrating their 50 years in 2018."}
{"text":"Bitondo's is a charming hole in the wall making bona fide pizzas. The pizzas have the perfect cheese to sauce ratio with a glistening blanket of grease. The pepperonis are not my favourite. They're thicker cuts. Panzos and veal sandwiches are also available."}
{"text":"maybe the best kept \"pizza\" secret in toronto. simple and tasty ingredients on a big a$$ folding pizza with massive amounts of fresh cheese... and the little man making the pizza?? hes a pro  you can tell. not a whole lot of seating inside so take your wonderful pie to the streets."}
{"text":"Bitondo's rocks my world. I have made mention a number of times, of the difficulty in finding a new spot for reasonably priced, delicious, basic pizza. Bitondo's was (and still is) like a godsend.

The no-delivery thing is a little problematic (and probably a good thing, cuz it would be tempting to order all the damn time), because usually when I need a whole pizza, laziness is involved in some way. It is doubtful that I will spend the half-hour walking there and back, and I usually don't.

Thus, slices picked up while walking by it shall be. But hold up! Because it is impossible for me to choose pizza over the panzerottis which are literally one of my favourite food items on planet earth. They are indeed huge, so I will usually only eat about half at once (and with some salad to reverse/enhance the effects). And there was that time last summer where 3 of our broke asses shared one and a coke and managed to be quite satisfied. Ah, the little pleasures in life."}
{"text":"Yummy Panzerotto! It's about one of the only places in Toronto that you can get a deep fried panzerotto after panzerotto pizza closed. If you're looking for that please tell me where that exists. The crust is much thicker and the pepperoni isn't as good. I gave it four stars not so much for the food but for the experience. The inside is like stepping back in time in a good way. The signage is old school and the fact that they have a Pac man table seat seals the deal."}
{"text":"This is the kind of pizza I imagine them eating on Friends. The kind of pizza you idealize as THE pizza. We ordered a large cheese with a panzo for later (it's in my fridge.. Waiting) and it was lovely, no frills yummy pizza. Perfectly melted cheese, sweet tomato sauce, and just the right amount of grease. Paired with a brio it is fast Italian food perfection."}
{"text":"Bitondo's was the first pizzeria in Toronto where someone actually greeted me in Italian. Everyone who works here is so nice -- they make the experience just as good as the food.

And the food is good. Better than my Nonna makes (don't tell her). Delicious, cheap pizza, and panzarottis from heaven. I couldn't have that much cheese everyday...but God, I could really go for one right now.

Definitely worth a visit -- stay inside in the winter, sit on the benches in the summer. And don't just have the pizza -- everything is good old-fashioned Italian cooking."}
{"text":"I heart you Bitondo's

Youve been my staple for hang over food and none hang over food for a few years..When ever I return to the city - I make a bee line to you..your lovely gooey cheese panzerotti's makes my tummy sooo happy..with extra sauce..on top-- i drool in anticipation of devouring one of your Delicious heart attacks encased in cheese...

Damn I just made my self hungry...."}
{"text":"For joints as classic and timeless as bitondos I choose to keep my reviews short and sweet. The veal sandwiches - crispy, saucy and sensual. The slices? They are cut from the golden wheel my friend - it is hard to find a better or more classic slice on this earth. Anyone who says otherwise just doesn't understand pizza. 

I get it - Everyone's a critic - but when I read some of the negative reviews here I can tell that they are written by some pizza novices. Some people just don't see the magic even when it's right in front of them (pizza magic, love magic... whatever!) it's not that they can't see it - but they somehow miss it. Damn shame. 

Go to the monarch. Have a pint. Wander over to bitondos. Enjoy your pizza. Enjoy your life. Enjoy...BITONDOS."}
{"text":"I'm really not a big fan of pepperoni pizza, but Bitondo's slices are a winner.  I quite like the tomato sauce.  Nice big slices (practically 2 slices in one) and cheap at a tax-in $2.75.  It's a 5 minute (or less) walk for me and I think I've been 3 times in the past 2 weeks.

Despite the other reviewers' praise, for now I'll pass on the panzerotto.  Have you ever seen a MODEL of a pound of fat?... well, that's pretty much what it reminds me of, anyway ... *shudder*"}
{"text":"There is nothing I cherish more than a mom-and-pop shop that's just embedded into the neighbourhood. Take a few steps south of College St and it's fully residential -- save for this place. I stopped in with some Little Italians (Nicole A, Kent P) for an afternoon sammich and was not disappointed.

The decor is pretty much non-existent, so taking your meal to go isn't a bad option. Because I am One Of The People, I had no problem taking a seat on the worn lawn furniture and devouring my lunch atop a paper bag. The young lady in our company was served on Royal Chinet. We tried to convince her that this was a racist slight (nothing quite like a sandwich shop rumble) but she wasn't having it.

What did I eat? A six dollar veal sandwich that's what. It was the size of my head and 37 times as delicious (this means very delicious). I washed it down with a Brio (again I'm OOTP) which was a winning move. Their panzerotto (pure cheese, baby) looks pretty good too. Definitely a neighbourhood gem.

Obligatory Title Pun: Give a little BIT/Give a little BIT of your time for me.

Menu Readability: There was some kind of forgettable dilapidated sign. 

Need to mention: They are also known for their pizza. Worth checking out.

What this place teaches me about myself: Supertramp!"}
{"text":"After eating many a time at California sandwich. I was told of bitondos just up the street.  
Less breading and a better sauce, and cheaper. You can't go wrong.  Plus if you have a big appetite you can grab a $3 pizza slice, which is amazing."}
{"text":"The $3 greasy slices are delightful, and people go nuts for their panzos,which are essentially grown up, giant, extra-cheesy pizza pockets. 

However, their entire pie experience didn't quite live up to my pizza dreamz. The crust was dry and they were stingy with the meat. The sausage went under the cheese and was basically just pepperoni, and there was hardly any pep above the cheese. I did appreciate their cheese ratio, but it just didn't live up to the hype and my previous slice experiences.

Will I give them another try? Of course. It's the cutest pizza place on the planet, and I'd like to try their veal sandwiches."}
