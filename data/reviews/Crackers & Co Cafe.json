{"text":"We have been coming here on Saturday mornings for a couple of weeks and I just had to let you all know how great they are. Every bit of food that we have ordered has been top notch and every server has given absolutely exemplary service. I recommend any of their skillets and to start out with a cinnamon roll for the table. The servers remember us and events in our lives that we casually discussed with them and enquire about these events when we come in. This level of attention to detail and dedication to customer service is far above and beyond what is normal for the area. I absolutely love Crackers and Co. Cafe and cannot recommend them enough!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Cali eggs benny was yummy! Stop in and give it a try! Carnitas was Delish too:)"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good and you can tell there is a frequent regular crowd there, which is always a good sign. It's small, and has a nice Chicago theme, probably best for weekdays vs. crowded weekends."}
{"text":"I have lived fairly close to Crackers for years and barely tried it several months ago with my boyfriend. I'm saddened that I did not try Crackers sooner! We love trying new, local, establishments and we're quite fond of Crackers. The service is great, the food hasn't disappointed us one bit and the coffee is delicious! You definitely get more bang for your buck at Crackers. We try and go as often as we can. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, good service, and the top 5 restaurants I eat in AZ for the last 25 years. Kim is a great sever so ask for her if you like great service! I take all my friends from Iowa to eat here when they come to visit my family. No complaints from any of them."}
{"text":"WOW! I went to this place for breakfast with my boyfriend. He got the cinnamon french toast and I got the California Egg Benny. WOW! (Again). It was a biscuit, open face, with 2 poached eggs, avocado, bacon, spinach and tomato covered with hollandaise sauce. It came with potatoes on the side. I had to move my plate away from my boyfriend as he tried to eat his food and mine. Very scrumptious!! I would say it was by far one of the best breakfasts I have had. The french toast was sweet and soft and also very scrumptious.

The service was a delight, and the environment was very welcoming and comforting. I plan on going back there for lunch and of course breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was great. Went for brunch with some friends and very happy with our decision. Plenty of good choices on their menu. I had the southwestern chorizo carnitas skillet and it was delicious. Tons of flavor. Everyone else was quite happy with their choices as well and surprisingly there were no t o-go boxes needed as everyone scarfed down everything, even my girlfriend who never finishes anything but polished off her plate here no problem. Definitely recommending this place to others and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was seated immediately despite it being busy.  Waitress was over soon after to take my drink order and back quickly for food order. Food arrived quickly but had my eggs scrambled instead of over easy. Waitress apologized and returned soon after with correct order. Food was delicious and made well. I ordered crepes breakfast with strawberries and bananas. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been back three times since my first visit (and review) and my opinion has actually improved of this restaurant. 

First, the water. On my first review, I said they serve Mesa tap water. Well, on each visit since, I've had water and it never tasted as funky as that first visit. Perhaps the water filtration system was acting up that initial visit. 

In my three visits since my original review, I've had the following:

Eggs Benny California-syle which is your typical Eggs Benny, but with spinach and bacon instead of ham. It was very good! The portions were huge and I wasn't able to finish it which I was sad about since it was so tasty.

Pancakes with granola and fruit. There is actually a special name for this plate, but I can't remember what it was called. Maybe \"Healthy Pancakes\" or something like that. This was so good, but so filling! I wasn't even able to eat half of the plate. They were very generous with the fruit which I loved because so many places are stingy when it comes to fruit.

Drunken Chicken (again) without the bread... this is obviously turning in to my Go-To for Crackers. I love this lunch! This time around I got it with fruit on the side and was thrilled that Crackers uses an assortment of fruit - not just the usual cantaloupe and honeydew. There were berries, grapes, and all kinds of delicious fruit in a large bowl. Delicious!

I suppose it is no surprise that I will be going back to Crackers!"}
{"text":"We ordered a skillet with egg, shredded pork, beans, crispy corn tortillas topped with a red sauce which came with a side of sour cream and salsa. We also ordered French toast with bacon. Both plates were very good but the pork carnitas stole the show. I will go back for that dish! Service was good too."}
{"text":"Love the cinnamon roll french toast. Every time my out of town family visits, this is the place we take them. Always friendly service and always great food."}
{"text":"Visited here on a non-busy Saturday afternoon. Our orders were taken promptly, and a half hour later, no food. At this point we asked if the food would be out soon, and we were told the burgers were just going on the grill. Smoke had been seeping into the dining room also, so maybe they burned our lunch the first time? While we waited the crew started to put the chairs up on the tables to begin the shut down process. Hey, we haven't even been served lunch! Once it arrived, the food was good. But not enough to overturn the awkwardly long wait."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast!!!You must try the December Steak Burrito special.  Just plain yummy. Well season and tender with country potatoes done just right."}
{"text":"There soup was wonderful. Went with family it was so good! Such a great time!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Holiday Inn near by and after reading the reviews here on Yelp I decided to give Crackers & Company a try. I ordered my standard Ham & Eggs but I was tempted to have their \"Mess\" which was SOS with eggs and a slice of Prime Rib. The one thing I read in the previous reviews that caught my interest was the country potatoes. I'm always looking for a breakfast place that serves home fries where the potatoes are sliced and fried with onion, it's hard to come by. The review I read said that they sliced their potatoes so I was hopeful. The potatoes did not get fried with onion but they were still great. The ham was a good sized slice and the eggs were cooked perfectly. OK, here's how Crackers and Company failed to get the 5th star.....the English muffin was not toasted and they buttered it which made it soggy. I didn't send it back because by the time the second English muffin was delivered most of my breakfast would have been eaten. It's not like the restaurant was busy and they were rushing the orders out, I was the second table of the day so there's no excuse for not toasting the English muffin properly. My suggestion to anyone like me is tell your server that you want the English muffin toasted properly. It's a shame that a place that's been called the best breakfast in the Phoenix area would have to be told how to toast an English muffin. I'm I just being too picky????"}
{"text":"We were in AZ visiting the Great Grandparents.  It was very kid friendly, with excellent food.  The service was prompt, friendly and accurate despite being very busy.  I was especially impressed with the quality if the coffee."}
{"text":"No joke, the best tasting breakfast we have ever had. From the kindness of the staff to the delicious meals and amazing prices. We will be back every Sunday."}
{"text":"What good inexpensive breakfast. I had the Farmers Scramble. It was good and the service was good once they decided who's table we were..."}
{"text":"I loved the quick service and california benny. Shared the bread pudding. It was awsome!!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee too expensive, poached eggs returned 2x for being cold, then got charged for potatoes, in lieu or
of not having eggs, in addition to 8.79 for 4 pcs french toast and bacon.. was going to be charged 1.29 more , instead of just substituting potatoes for eggs. Manager finally removed 1.29 after another attempt, to which manager stated he took $ eggs off and replaced with potatoes, so this way my dish would cost more than what ordered?????  Absurd....and Will never return here again. Potatoes were delicious..that is all."}
{"text":"I stopped by with a friend for brunch on Thursday. My culinary lesson for this week is to not assume that a place that is only open until 2:30 p.m. will be serving breakfast until closing. Noon is the cut off here. So, my hopes for an Eggs Benedict dashed, I sullenly ordered the chicken sandwich with a side salad. It was good! The substantial outdoor seating is perfect for the spring weather. The service was prompt and we left relaxed, well fed , and glad that we tried a new place."}
{"text":"Super, duper, fabulous breakfast and lunch cafe!  We are lucky to have one here in NE Mesa.  With the fabulous weather patio seating is so enjoyable and relaxing.  Our waitress Laurel is the quintessential server.  I'm looking forward to our next brunch there already!"}
{"text":"The Southwest Chorizo Pork Carnitas breakfast is excellent.  I ate way too much. Great, peaceful dining atmosphere. Derrick was the perfect server!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food!  The Spiced pumpkin pancakes were very good!  The Southwest carnitas omelette was great!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast on a rare rainy day in September and we weren't disappointed. We tried a variety of items and all were good. The one hiccup in service was the water we requested never arrived, but the good food made up for the oversight."}
{"text":"I probably go to crackers once every two weeks. I'm not a big breakfast person but my roommates are so this place is perfect! They have a big menu and I love there selection of salads and sandwiches. My roommates are in love with the cinnamon rolls here. I really enjoy the mango chicken sandwich and the south of the border salad. You get a lot of food for a really good price. They do get really busy so expect to wait a little bit before getting a table. But the wait is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Bread Pudding! GO!

Divine! It even has a dark chocolate surprise somewhere deep in the bread pudding that i didn't expect, but totally went ape-shit when I found it.

The food was good and filling, and lots of variety. I'm a breakfast girl myself and their selection was a-ok, and their portions more than enough.

Here's my reason for not giving the place the fifth star:
I normally go on a Sunday brunch, the only time I have to enjoy a brunch. Now, I've got nothing against church-going people, but at that time, that's the crowd you get -- grandparents dressed to the nines, their hair perfectly did, smelling like a rose garden on steroids; the kids are wearing one of their best outfits and are itching to take them off; the hungry babies are in full force...and then there's me and my posse, walking in the restaurant with dark glasses and ratty jeans, unshowered, with a hint of morning breath. A little out of place right?

I'm going to go ahead and call us a little \"edgier\" than the Sunday crowd.

But...the Red Velvet bread pudding...GO!"}
{"text":"We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Crackers hundreds of times and it is always really really good, but they have a new special item that is hands down AMAZING!!!!!
Not sure of the correct name but it is a Southwest Pork Carnitas breakfast Nachos.
Pork carnitas, jack cheese, tomatillo salsa, layered on top of freshly made tortilla chips then 2 eggs on top, which I had poached. It was served with their country potatoes, which are always wonderful. 

Whomever invented these breakfast nachos needs a raise!!! AMAZING doesn't even give this special breakfast item justice. The flavors were superb and who knew nachos for breakfast would be soooo good. I hope it is made a regular item. We all know how BBQ nachos have done at other restaurants. They sell out where ever they are served.

Well done to the inventor of the Pork Carnitas Breakfast Nachos at Crackers & Co!!!!
And a big shout out to our server yesterday, Ty!!! He always has a smile, he keeps the drinks coming, and is always super friendly and professional. And another shout out to the manager David Q. 
David runs a very clean restaurant, is always roaming the restaurant greeting customers and I have watched him be very kind to his staff, which wins big points in my book!!! Happy staff makes Crackers & Co always a joy to dine at.

FYI: the bread pudding of any flavor is one of the best bread puddings I have ever tasted all over the country. And yes, I am a Foodie!!!!"}
{"text":"This café is my favorite! They are always offering new varieties of their delicious breakfast foods. My favorites are the waffles! They have so much to choose from. The wait time is always very minimal and the service is always great and speedy!"}
{"text":"Reviews are dead on good food good service in a little bit of a strange out of the way location."}
{"text":"This place is good, period. I had the first skilled listed (the carnitas skillet?) which included eggs, potatoes, carnitas, chorizo, green chile salsa, montery jack cheese, and tortillas, salsa, and sour cream on the side. The portion was generous, as expected for the $9 price tag, but it was well worth it. Absolutely delicious, even the next morning (I love leftovers). My girlfriend had the cally eggs benedict which was also delicious and very enticing. It was a traditional eggs benny with avocado, tomato, hollandaise, and bacon (I believe). Very good, with a great side of country potatoes. 

The place was clean, pleasant, the service was good, and the food came out exceptionally fast. It's also pretty large; I was a little concerned about going there at 10 on a Sunday morning, but we were seated right away.  This could be because of the tucked away location, which is behind the home depot.  I wish we would have had room for some early afternoon dessert, because their homemade cheesecakes looked amazing. 

I originally gave this place 4 stars, but I don't have any complaints, the experience, service, and food was great, I don't think they could have done anything better, I just wish they had a location in central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I really love the Benedict's at this place. I come here often with my team from work and they do a fairly good job with the accommodations. Service can sometimes be slow, but that happens in any restaurant. I recommend this to anyone looking for a breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Service was top notch, atmosphere was excellent - inside and outside dining. Prices were good - except for coffee. Nearly $3/person for bottomless cup - where I'm from it's less than $1."}
{"text":"Except the usual short wait during the weekend, I have nothing to complain about Crackers & Co.
Their California Egg Benny has been my ultimate favorite and the service is quick with reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was by far the best find for a long time. We went today Sunday at about 10:30 had a 5 minute wait. Really good for a Sunday. We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner. The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized. I would recommend this location to anyone. We each ordered something different and all was good. Drinks a little expensive but still for a first time going there I was really impressed."}
{"text":"Today I was looking for someplace new to try and I ran across Cracker & Co. I looked at the on-line menu and liked what I read so off I went. Given that I live in East Mesa, the location on Greenfield Rd was the best choice. 
Upon arrival we had about a ten minute wait which isn't too bad for high season on a  Saturday morning after 9AM. The waiting area is really small so I can see how there would be a lot of outside overflow on a Sunday. The hostess(s) we congenial upon our arrival so there was no issue there. 

Our server, Tad, was attentive and congenial. The coffee we ordered was good. The coffee is a big issue with me because I feel that if you're cutting corners on the coffee then you're more than likely going to be cutting corners on everything else.  I did have a beef with the water. It tasted like tap water, chlorine taste and all. The young man that I believe was the manager assured me that the water was filtered but that doesn't mean jack because there's a lot of different grades of filtering depending on what you're trying to filter out. Bottom line is I tasted something there that shouldn't have been there. 

For a starter I ordered a scone. The scone is described as \"Fresh baked\" and \"Light and flaky\" but I found that not to be the case. It was heavy and more like something that was packaged for resale in a 7-11. I would definitely not say this was a fresh baked scone and was something else. 

My breakfast meal was the California Eggs Benny. This dish had a good presentation and was well prepared. I ate it with no reservations. Everything seemed to be fresh and tasty.

The only reason that I gave 4 stars and not 5 was because of the water taste. My dining companion had no issues with hers so maybe I'm just spoiled rotten by always drinking reverse osmosis water. I even have a dechlorinator on my shower so maybe I'm just sensitized to chlorine smell and taste. 

Overall, I recommend the place. While my review may be quite different from the reviews that posters previous to me gave, it could be said that the management is reactive to the issues that they noted. By the way, I am in no way connected to this restaurant or any other restaurant. My review are totally independent."}
{"text":"Great food and good oldies! Quality place and will definitely be there again. Really good appetizers and solid meals!"}
{"text":"Been back since my last review and order something different. I was a super fan this time. It was one of there Spanish/Maxican breakfast plates. It was really good. I had a friend tell me once that the Mexican breakfast dishes were not good, I guess that it depends on you and eater. I would return and order this same breakfast again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious and service is great! Must go to place! Been coming here for years. I get the chicken fried steak biscuits and gravy meal sub pancakes instead of toast, so much food for only 8.99!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Best California Benedict ever!  One of the best breakfasts I have ever had. I wish we had this place on Denver!!!  Great service, spacious dining area, excellent menu."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their breakfast is amazing! The location is a little hard to find, but it's worth the search. The interior design is very neat, they have faux finished on their wall, it makes it seem like you're in Tuscany. hahaha or maybe not. I would suggest everyone at least try this place once. It's just a good place to enjoy a great morning breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch! Chicken Enchilada skillet was very good. Not usually fond on corn tortillas, but worked with the dish. French toast was delicious as well. Portions are good sized with leftovers for a second meal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were waiting to get our car fixed and found this local breakfast place. The place was very crowded so we figured it must be pretty good. We ended up sitting at the bar instead of a table to cut down the wait. Our server prompt and nice but the food was average at best. We split a skillet with carnitas and green chile that was bland with a hard tortilla.  I was expecting a little more after reading the reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had the French toast and the wifey Had biscuits and gravy. They were both fantastic.  And the service was the best thanks to Debbie. I will definitely return!! I think I found my new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"A hangovers dream! Breakfast here will satisfy the stomach grumbles and leave a smile on your face. I wouldn't say it's the best breakfast place around but definitely good. The service was really good and our order came up quickly.

I look forward to trying lunch here sometime soon when I'm not hungover."}
{"text":"friendly,  affordable, and delicious ! the menu has lots of variety.  I am always finding something new to order on the menu and it's always been great."}
{"text":"I had the steak avocado sandwich and it was amazing. Cooked exactly as I wanted it, and the service was fantastic. Very friendly and quick. We have to come back because we kept drooling over what we saw coming out if the kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food, and location...went in on a Thurs morning and got sat right away. Im guessing weekends will be more crowded but with good reason..great menu choices but the best is that they serve breakfast ALL DAY..got egg white omelet wit veggies..veggies very fresh..potatoes also fresh..sliced and not shredded or boring greasy cube kind..french toast light and fluffy..yes I had that with my eggwhite omlete..dont judge...waitress was so friendly and patient..cant wait to go back and try lunch"}
{"text":"Took my out of town family here for breakfast. They both had the Vatican skillet, I had the cinnamon French toast. Everything was good. Simple food done well. Nothing unique in taste, but good. 
 It's been a couple of years since I've eaten here. The last time I was here my only complaint was the waitress wasn't very attentive. Received the same kind of service. Food and service decent but not memorable."}
{"text":"A dear friend has been craving eggs benedict for awhile, so I thought I'd take him to Cracker & Co., as he's never been.  Not only did he love the eggs benedict, but he swiftly became obsessed with the homemade hashbrowns.  I was personally wowed by our server Kim.  All of the special requests I made (which there were quite a few) were delivered perfectly and with a smile.  By far the best service I have received in an incredibly long time.  If you've never been, I highly recommend that you check it out and ask for Kim to serve you.  You simply can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST & BRUNCH you will ever find in the Phoenix area. My husband and I's fav spot, we've been back so many times I can't count. It's such a tragedy we moved to Tucson. The California Egg Benedict is THE Best, I tried replicating it at home, and it's just not the same, close but no cigar, hahaha. It came with yummy potatoes on the side, which was also had a home made taste. We also tried the french toast, soo scrumptiuos!! Its in an odd location but what a hidden gem! The deocr and ambiance was just perfect! And I love when food, ambiance and price is right! I think they just opened one in Tempe.. I can't wait to go again, when we drive up to visit friends!"}
{"text":"Crackers has great food- I ordered The French toast and my boyfriend ordered the Farmers skillet- but what is even Better is their customer service.

Right when we walked in the door, the hostesses were incredibly kind and went out of their way to help us out. Derek, our server, was seriously the most considerate person I've met in a long time, and great at his job.

I've been to a lot of brunch places and never have been so overwhelmed with the awesome service- definitely stop by (ask for Derek!)"}
{"text":"GRITTY BALLS IN STINKING BROTH

I was craving Chicken and Dumplings today. Passed on joining my teammates for lunch at Oregano's and order to go from them since they have Chicken and Dumplings.  I called and was told to give them 15 minutes. I shows up in 15 minutes and still had to wait about 5 minutes. The To Go person was very friendly.  So far not so bad, other than waiting for my soup.

I returned to the office to devour my soup. I pop the lid to the soup was so disappointed. No gravy but broth. No dumplings but 3 huge balls made of grits or farina. No chicken. I asked  separate people what my dish was and not one believed it was Chicken and Dumplings. Most assumed it was a vegetable soup. 

I started to eat and was so grossed out. The balls are just too gritty for someone craving dumplings. The broth smelled gross and lack any real flavor. The vegetables were okay. I can't comment on the chicken because it had not one piece of chicken.  

The one star is for the young lady behind the To Go counter, she was bright and friendly. 

For the restaurant if you veer that far from a recipe you should state so in your menu. But then who would ever order stale grit balls in stinky broth?"}
{"text":"Not really sure how this place got any high reviews.  Not impressed.  Our server was great but the food --- not so much.  I had the pork carnitas melt and left more than half of it on the plate.  Not at all impressive.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews on here and they were mostly favorable so I checked this place out with my family. Everything was excellent from the food to the service. I don't have any complaints. We were told there was a 10 minute wait and I don't even think it took that long to get a table. All of the trays coming out of the kitchen looked phenomenal and everybody with me was pleased. We all left stuffed. I wish I had room for dessert. Maybe next time. I had the huevos rancheros. I thought it had a very good flavor, the carnitas were made right, the salsa was good, it had just enough spice to it. 
I don't see how you could be disappointed dining here. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Crackers behind Home depot for years.  Today we happened to come across this location after doing a little furniture shopping.....Wow.

We arrived around 1:30 and were seated immediately.  Having visited The other location many times before, we placed our order with Whitney, our server, and received our food in what can only be described as \"incredible\" time.

Everything was Awesome.  My wife had her usual, the Californian sandwich, while I decided on the Carnitas sandwich.  The food looked just as good as it tasted.  we each had the small dish of fruit with our meals, which seemed as if it had been cut just prior to leaving the kitchen.  our drinks never went empty and our plates were cleared with lightning speed.

We'll definitely be back next time we're in Tempe.  Exactly what we've come to expect from Crackers.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Just ate there this morning. Had the Country fried steak and biscuits and gravy. The steak was flavorless, the gravy very plain and boring, like out of a bag, and the service was subpar. It's not that she was rude or anything it's that she was barely present. The kicker was that I ran to the restroom to find that my small table had been connected with another table for what seemed to be a larger group coming in. The lack of attention by the staff, and my server especially made for a very poor experience. I was really looking forward to trying this place after reading all the great reviews sadly they missed the chance to gain a new customer with me. I'll take my business elsewhere, like TC Eggington's down the street, from now on."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how many times I have eaten here. It's been that many! Usually when we talk about going to breakfast, brunch or lunch we don't even have to discuss where to go. Crackers is our default. For a long long time I got the New Hampton every time I went. Then they went and changed the menu on me! So now I rotate between the new princess, eggs Benedict and the breakfast burrito. My daughter always gets the biscuits and gravy and it's fantastic. The pancakes and French toasts are spot on also.  
Their coffee is excellent and I LOVE that they have actual vanilla creamer. 

The only downside is that it gets very crowded on the weekends. I hesitate to go during peak hours but they I start thinking of that perfect hollandaise sauce dripping over perfectly prepared egg which is laying atop that just toasted to perfection English muffin and I wait no matter how long it takes!"}
{"text":"We were in town looking for a decent breakfast spot.  The yelp reviews were really high so we thought we'd give it a try.  We were all glad we did.  The food and service both were amazing.   My wife had the cinnamon swirl French toast and it was perfect.  Three huge, thick slices of bread with powdered sugar on top.  She made through two slices but had to give up. My son had a meatlovers omelet and I had the garden omelet.  Both were amazing.  Filled with the perfect ingredients and fried potatoes to round out the plate.   The restaurant is in an industrial area but don't be fooled by the surroundings.  Service was quick and friendly and it had a nice relaxed atmosphere.  Highly recommend this place.  A must try."}
{"text":"I always come back to Crackers. Friends tell me about new breakfast spots around town and I check them out, but no one seems to have the combination of great food, great service and friendly atmosphere that I find at Crackers. 

They have figured out breakfast. The only downside is that a lot of other people apparently feel the same way!!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here one Saturday morning. Had an excellent omelette and another in my group tried the pancakes. I tasted them and thought them to be great too. The service was efficient and courteous despite the place being very busy that morning. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice classic breakfast."}
{"text":"I got the Chorizo, carnitas skillet, & it was good, but not very flavorful. There was a strange white sauce in it, in addition to the cheese & potatoes which I'm sure increased the calorie count significantly, but didnt add much to the flavor. I tried to throw some salsa on top, but the salsa was bland as well. Prices were fair and the portion was rather large, so I didnt eat the toast that came with it. The service was very good, lightening fast actually! Only 3 stars however cause the food lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Crackers for years and I can honestly say I have NEVER had a bad meal.  Their food is so friggin good that i'm craving it right now as I type.  From breakfast (sirloin or california eggs benedict are my two faves) to lunch (any salad or soup is great and of course the best sandwich ever - Roast Beef Avocado Melt) to dessert (world famous Bread Pudding and the ever so chocolaty Kahlua Brownie) you cant go wrong!! 

great atmosphere.  Always packed.  great service."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Crackers for almost a year now. Favorite breakfast/lunch spot. I had to finally write this review after my current visit. There's a reason they have a 20 min wait on the weekend's and I've never minded waiting. The food is awesome and the wait staff is expedient and friendly. Angelina, the manager, always goes out of her way to check on us and has made us feel welcome. I appreciate the extra attention to customer service the whole staff provides. Even in busy,chaotic times they manage to render great service."}
{"text":"Bomb food for my hangover! Two thumbs up!! Had the pork carnitas skillet; service was fast and food was delicious"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the menu is diverse, the atmosphere is very light, casual and friendly, and the wait staff is very attentive.  I have only been their for breakfasts, but they are always wonderful.

Portions are large, price is reasonable."}
{"text":"We go here weekly.  Food is always good and service for the most part is pretty good.  This time I got a meat lovers omelet which has ham, bacon and sausage.  I had them put green onions in it.  My wife  got blintzes.  Decent prices.  Will be back again next week."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast place. The Huevo Rancheros was great! You get a ton of food and a ton of meat.  This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Went Oct of 2014.  Sister/brother suggested and I went by it twice.  Could not see the Name of the building due to the tree in front of it.  Food, service and atmosphere is absolutely top notch.  Laurel even had my toast delivered warm, as I requested.  I highly recommend Crackers & Co Cafe...... a wonderful, comfortable and very clean eating establishment."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was good our server Kim was friendly and attentive! We will visit again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Crackers for years... it's one of the first breakfast places I can remember going to (the old location of course, but this one is much closer to me now). I've had most of the breakfast items and have honestly loved every one. My very favorite is the farmer's skillet- just fabulous! This place is HIGHLY reccommended!"}
{"text":"My family loves going here for breakfast! Great food and you can sit on the patio if it is a nice day table are usually a little wobbly out there though.
Be prepared for a wait the food is wonderful and they only advertise by word of mouth so that says something!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast this morning; the food leaves a lot to be desired. I would give the food three stars overall, but the service was not very good at all. Why do they pack everyone in the very back by the kitchen when the rest of the restaurant is empty? It took much too long just to order drinks. 

Everytime I leave, I resolve not to come back, but somehow we end up back there and it is always a disappointment."}
{"text":"Everything is great. Huge variety, homemade, and at least 5 soups featured daily.  I always get the California eggs Benedict. Their specialty berry bread pudding is \"to die for.\" the Iron Ave location sits behind the Home Depot on Country Club just south of 60 in a grey \"strip mall\". Easy to find once you know where it is. There is another much newer location on Greenfield & Brown. The NE corner.  We go there frequently and have never been disappointed in the food or service;)"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! Went here for breakfast and almost licked my plate clean!  Food was delicious and service was great!  Everything on my plate looked picture perfect and the best part was that everything was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a large menu to satisfy anyone's tastes. They have delicious daily lunch specials with half sandwich options paired with soup. I'm partial to the potato soup topped with bacon, chives and sour cream! The restaurant can get a little crowded, especially with snow-birds, but it's worth the wait if you have the time. They can accommodate larger parties and service is always wonderful."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast/brunch spot.  We tried the skillets, and the portions are huge - I couldn't finish it.  Good flavor, but a little too oily (we had the southwest carnitas).  Service was friendly, and the food was served quickly.  I'm not sure if that's typical, but the food was ready almost immediately!

The restaurant decor itself is nice.  A somewhat standard brunchy atmosphere, which is the goal here."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the freshest eggs I have tasted in a long time.  The servers are always friendly and prompt.  I have only frequented for breakfast and had a great mothers day and easter brunch, will definatly keep going back."}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for, a great breakfast.  Only a 5 minute wait on a Saturday morning, fresh coffee and delicious food.  We had a Mexican skillet and a Carnitas skillet, both well seasoned.  The tomatillo salsa was a great counterpoint to the rich Carnitas and creamy thin sliced potatoes.  Thank you Yelpers, these out of towers would have never discovered it on our own!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, I went to Crackers and debated on whether to get a lunch item or breakfast.  I ended up going with a lunch item. 

I went with the Roast Beef Avocado Melt. The sandwich was very good and hearty. The side of fries seemed a bit small in portion and little over salted. 

Prices are resonable for a sandwich and side (soup, fries, salad), 7.99-8.99. The burger options run about the same price.

The menu offers lots of options-sandwiches, burgers, salads, half soup/sandwich etc.

Breakfast items are served all day, everday which is always a nice thing. I plan on heading back to try the breakfast since many people say this is a good spot for breakfast items."}
{"text":"Almost perfect. I had a tuna melt on marbled rye. The only shortcoming was that I could barely notice the cheese. My husband had the veggie omelet. It must have been good since his plate is clean. The service is excellent.  We were seated quickly and had our drinks and orders taken in a jiffy. Definitely worth a visit. We will be back."}
{"text":"I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers locations, because their breakfast menu rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a bite to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The menu has a huge variety of breakfast dishes, sandwiches, salads and soups. On weekends, they serve breakfast all day! 

I got the Carnitas breakfast skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The pork was so tender; covered with jack cheese on a bed of potatoes, heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the bacon! I have had some of their soups before, and let's just say, the Cream of Spinach & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and creamy, it is like eating dip without the chips! 

They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a bite to eat for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Literally the best breakfast food I've ever had. Not much more expensive than a Denny's and infinitely better. The cinnamon swirl french toast and the eggs benedict are fantastic. Also, the service has always been really great (even when they're at their busiest) with friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Yum! We came here one Friday morning with a large group and the food was delicious. Service was EXCELLENT! I would highly recommend to anyone in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place and was it a super good place tucked away from the main road!  The food, service and atmosphere was well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Cracker's and Co another try today, bad idea. Co-worker placed an order for carry out for 3 lunches. One was a 1/2 sandwich and soup - got the wrong soup. Two others were sandwich and soup combo's. Sandwich that should have had dressing on the side did not and the Tortilla soup was just bad - literally an oil slick in the Styrofoam  bowl, too greasy to eat! Plus, why can't meat and other toppings be place evenly on a sandwich? Who wants a sandwich with no fixings on the edge?

Used to really like this place ...."}
{"text":"1st they gave our spot in line to another party so we had to wait longer. Then once we ordered, it took 50 minutes to get our food. Then the manager chose to embarrass my husband by announcing to our whole table that he shouldn't have been allowed to order the way he did. He could have solved the problem by informing his waitresses how someone can order certain things instead of embarrassing us in front of our friends. Very unprofessional and inappropriate. We won't be back. That is no way to treat customers. The only saving grace was the waitress who was very professional and kind."}
{"text":"The food is really good, worthy of 5 stars, but docking two because the ceiling vents right in the dining area are covered in giant dust bunnies, and it calls for concern about the kitchen area. It's really unfortunate that this really good place could be ruined by the dust falling into your food."}
{"text":"Brand new item hit the menu yesterday, a Bandito Burrito -- chorizo, ham, sausage, onions, New Mexico Green Chili and jack cheese. Too tempting not to try and it was definitely worth it. The spicy kick was there but not overwhelming. Wasn't excited about the cilantro tomato sauce as on the menu so opted for the tomatillo sauce, which was good but not exciting, another alternative should be researched that would blend.  The house made salsa on the other hand was excellent. 

The restaurant was well occupied for a Sunday morning. A bit cool in temperature so a jacket or sweater may be in order for some. There is enough room between tables so conversations aren't battling."}
{"text":"I do not understand how this place is still in business, let alone the good reviews. I went here a couple of Sundays ago and it was one of the grossest and least satisfactory meals I've ever had. First, the place is crowded. I'm surprised they aren't violating the fire code they have jammed so many tables into the space. Second, it is just a gross and dirty place. It isn't super obvious but if you look around everything is covered in dust and grease, from the fake plants to the hot sauce bottles. Even the plates are scratched and dingy gray. Third, service was terrible, truly bad. I don't know if we just got a bad apple or what but we were just forgotten. No coffee refills, no syrup, no check ins. Fourth, the food. I had chicken fried steak. This might have been the most visually unappealing thing I've ever put in my mouth. It came with biscuits and eggs and everything was just slopped together on the aforementioned dingy gray plate. The eggs (yolks busted) were thrown on top. It looked like someone dropped it on the floor and then scraped it back on the plate. It tasted similarly and I ate literally one bite of each thing. Not that the server cared or noticed. Frankly, breakfast places like these are a dime a dozen and every single one that I have been to (Biscuits, The Good Egg, Over Easy) has been 10 times better than this place. Whoever owns this place needs to seriously consider investing some time into staff training and some money into revamping the atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service, officially my new favorite breakfast spot! Reasonable prices and the wait wasn't terrible even on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go for lunch. Their service is always fantastic and the food is always consistently good. 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and delicious bite to eat! 

I do wish I could order a bloody mary here though. ^_^"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I had a bad experience once (out of the 20 times I have been there) and they comped me a free meal!  I highly recommend this place, but hope they don't get too busy, or I won't get my french toast and pancakes as quick as usual--ha ha! :)"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a business park.  A fantastic little gem!  The food is amazing.  Even the coffee is of higher quality than most places I have been.  The service staff were very friendly and efficient too.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday and sat in the back room. I asked for his recommendation and he said the Southwest Benedict, and I put my trust in him and ordered it. No regrets what so ever. It was perfect, and better than I was expecting. The prices of everything I saw on the menu were very very reasonable. We love finding places that we can take the entire family to and enjoy an amazing meal for an affordable price. My favorite part was the service we got. Ty was quick to take orders and everything came out perfect. It's always a plus to have someone who is casual and makes you feel comfortable but also has a sense of urgency when you go out to eat. We will definetly be coming back here as much as we can."}
{"text":"This place is always super busy!  Despite the underground cult following, it's typical home style food.  They're only open for breakfast and lunch but it's worth checking out if you're in the area...and if you can find it within the small business strip mall it's located in."}
{"text":"Wow what a great meal and wonderful service. Came once had to come back the next day."}
{"text":"Food and service is okay.  Good and convenient place to eat, if you're at Home Depot shopping and you get hungry!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite breakfast place!!! I drive about 25 minutes from my house just to eat here whenever I can. The service is great and the food is absolutely amazing!! I usually get the Southwest Chorizo Carnita Skillet and it's always amazing! I also love to get their crepes with Nutella, if you love Nutella and crepes you'll love these!!! I have brought friends and family here and everyone is a fan!! I would warn those who wish to come on a Sunday morning need to be there bright and early because the breakfast rush usually hits between 9-10 and the wait can be around 30 minutes during that time span. I am a picky person when I order and tend to ask for things to be removed or put on the side and I never have had any issues! They are also great about refilling my water, which I usually go through a few refills while there! So please if you're looking for great food and service check them out, also one last note their prices are very comparable to other breakfast spots!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say I checked \"Nearby\" on Yelp from my friend's house in Mesa, and only 5 restaurants came up, total.  Of course, I filtered by \"Open Now\" and it was Sunday morning.  Crackers is our default breakfast spot in Mesa, so to Crackers we headed.  I don't even know why I look at the menu, because I always get the \"Breakfast 222\" (scrambled).  It's 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon or sausage, and two ginormous pancakes.  The service is super-fast, and the portions are huge (as evidenced by the number of obese patrons).  The food is yummy, and they keep your beverages full.  We noticed a sign twirler for Crackers on the corner of Country Club and Iron, and we were a little surprised, because you usually have a brief wait for a table there on Sunday morning.  Today, we were seated right away, and there were several empty tables.  This is NOT typical of Crackers, and potential guests should probably expect a short wait.  Crackers serves breakfast and lunch.  I've had lunch there once or twice.  My friend had the soup, and was not impressed.  I'm not a big salad and sandwiches type person, so I'd pass on lunch there again, but I will always recommend it for breakfast.  If you're vegetarian or vegan, however, you won't find much on the menu to your liking."}
{"text":"Breakfast experience: The granola pancakes and french toast were really really good. The pancakes had a nice selection of fresh fruit on top. The service was average. 

But, they were out of coffee. Out. Of. Coffee. If it wasn't for my hungry family, I would have walked out. I know I'm an addict for the caffeine, but c'mon. It's a breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! We ordered the meat lover's omelet and Butterfinger pancakes. Sadly, we could not finish them as the proportions were nice and large. Our waitress was also amazing, sweet, and attentive. 9/10 would eat here again. The only issue was the wait. But I suggest grabbing the bar seats."}
{"text":"I love this place!  In fact, its my birthday brunch go-to place,  its my guilty waffle fix, it's my kinda place to catch up with the other half or visiting family. And why wouldn't it be? What? With the wonderful variety of yummy brunch choices and supreme customer service its no wonder I keep coming back. As for my menu recommendations you really can't go wrong, everything is flooded with flavor and served in a generous fashion. 9 out of 10 times I have leftovers to go. But if I did recommend one thing it is to not skip out on the bread pudding! I get that almost every time and enjoy it more each time!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had hands down. From the hostess to the server to the busser, everyone was amazing. The food was perfection and I ordered way too much so I could try everything"}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible coffee. Service ok."}
{"text":"I am beginning to think that I wont find anything to complain about for this restaurant.  This is definitely a place I would bring out of town guests to prove Arizona food is off the charts!
My waitress was Taylor, a very friendly young lady with a warm smile.  She appeased me with my iced coffee mix of cups of ice and coffee.  I have been trying for weeks to taste the clam chowder here.  Finally, I got my wish.  Very nice flavor and a creamy texture.  Even though I am a HUGE fan of clam chowder, I must claim my love for their chili is deeper, sorry Mr. Chowder.
I ordered their Southwest Carnitas Plate.  OMG, if love is found in a man's stomach...cracker's will you marry me?  I dissected the plate.  Wanting to gain the experience of each individual item. can you say \"Y-U-M-M-M-M-Y\"?  The chorizo was great, nice flavor.  it was that pork that I found very drawn to.  Beautifully cooked and seasoned.  Very moist!
You just have to try it!!!!  On second thought...NO, don't try it because I dont want them running out of this item due to its popularity. 
I am just glad they dont advertise.....
Thanks Taylor and as usual Scott (does he live in the back room?)"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Crackers and Co! I've been meaning to review this place for a while now because I literally come here almost every week for the past three years and I've had nothing but great experiences. The wait staff are the most friendly I've experienced anywhere and they are always attentive. The menu is chock full of yummy options and they also have the best French toast I've ever had. It just seems like you can't order a bad dish off the menu because, no joke, everything they make here is incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here the other day. This place has to be one of the best hidden gems of the area, and that I've ever been to anywhere. It's randomly tucked behind a Home Depot, next to the holiday inn we are staying at here for spring training. 

Service was great, from the front desk to our server whose name I didn't quite catch... I think it was Murphy? But she was great. Attentive, talkative, and suggested a good burger spot as well we went to that night for dinner. 

I had the country fried steak with a biscuit and gravy. It was incredible. Everything tasted completely made from scratch, and of all things that biscuit was a huge stand out point of the meal. It was flaky and buttery and stood up to being topped with the steak and smothered in gravy without getting soggy. It was a generous enough portion to fill me up without feeling like I just shoveled a boat load of grease into my body. My wife had a parfait that was basic but still good by all means. I wish I had room to try their bread pudding or soups which seem to be a specialty here. 

My wife and I are here with our son who is a year and a half old and can be difficult in restaurants but we felt very comfortable here. It feels like your grandma turned her entire house into a restaurant. We got out of here for breakfast for 2 with coffee and a bowl of fruit for under $30. That's insane based on the quality and service. If I lived here this would definitely be a regular place to visit, and if you're in the area and haven't been you are seriously missing out. 

I work in the restaurant business and don't normally post yelp reviews but this place was definitely a stand out that you don't come by often. We'll be back before we leave town."}
{"text":"This little cafe is close to my work. I had driven by it numerous times when I used to live in the area and never stopped in. Thankfully a co-worker suggested it one day. I have been a fan ever since! There has never been a time when I haven't received excellent service. Even when we tell them we are on a time crunch they have got us in and out promptly. 
As for the food- I have yet to be disappointed. They have specials each month that are not to be missed. 
A personal favorite of mine that is thankfully a menu staple is the Mediterranean Harvest Salad. Mixed greens with grilled chicken, kalmatta olives, radishes, tomato, cucumber, herb feta cheese. Served with pita bread. It is divine! Crackers is only open for breakfast and lunch so don't miss out. I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was a overall good experience. We came here for a late breakfast. They serve breakfast all day which is super convenient. I got cinnamon swirl French toast and it was amazing!! The portion size was huge. My boyfriend got the California eggs Benedict. The breakfast potatoes were super good!! He like the eggs Benedict but said the tomatoes could have been fresher. Server was very polite but a little unavailable. Overall good experience and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"We had breakfast.  Large portions and delicious! It was a beautiful morning  and we asked to sit on the patio.  We were disappointed with how dirty it was.  Bird poop on all the umbrellas,  dirty water in an unused fountain,  empty  flower pots. It needs a good  power washing  outside and  some TLC."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food!  Our server David was awesome, he even sang to us.  Ask for David next time :)"}
{"text":"I reviewed my bank statement online today and found out they had charged me twice for bad food. I strongly recommend that you skip this restaurant all together. Management is unresponsive to customer concerns."}
{"text":"How disappointing!  

I was attracted to this cafe as I love all things egg and there was nothing else open Sunday on Elliot Rd., Tempe at that time of day.  In hindsight I can say, no wonder it was so busy.  Busy does not always mean good.
My husband loves steak so I suggested he order the Top Sirloin Steak Benny.  
My husband wanted his steak cooked medium but it came to the table literally \"bloody\" and the blood contaminated the muffins, egg, etc.  Yuck.
They offered to recook the steak and we noticed then how sinewy and gristly the steak really was.  It was an inferior cut of meat and only a little better.
The side of country potatoes were cooked in some type of lard rather than vegetable oil as they were really greasy and very bland.
The bill says we ordered a dish called Traditional yet the price is for the Top Sirloin Steak Benny.  I don't like things misleading.

As to the coffee, it was really weak yet it's $2.69.

The diner to the left of me left half her Spicy Mexican Breakfast on the table.  
Me, at first not so hungry chose not to eat there after seeing my husband's order.
  
I left a comment about the \"bloody\" steak on the credit receipt and they never reciprocated.  Guess they think they're OK.

And guess where we won't be going again!"}
{"text":"The euro crepe breakfast is perfection! I've been here a few times before, but just finished breakfast and had to leave a review. Eggs, bacon, and 3 crepes with a delicious whipped cream butter and powdered sugar... top it off with a flavored mimosa! It gets pretty busy on weekend mornings so plan a little wait time, but the food comes out fast. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here about a week ago, and The food was great. Everyone was very friendly and I felt comfortable I didn't feel rushed thru my meal. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service is good but food is meh! Same as any other American food restaurant, nothing out of this world. I guess I was looking for something different."}
{"text":"Took a girlfriend out for a birthday breakfast and when I asked where she would like to go she told me to pick cause I always find the good places (thanks to Yelp)... Well this time was no different, Crackers & Co has breakfast down to a delicious science. It was a Monday morning and not too busy when we arrived but was quite busy by the time we left 2 hrs later. The waitress was perfect... quickly took drink orders, answered all our questions, anticipated our needs after our food arrived and allowed us to sit and visit checking on us periodically without feeling pressured to get moving. 

They had 2 specials, crab cake eggs Benedict and peach pancakes so we ordered them both and split them. Food came out quickly, had good presentation and was hot! I felt the crab cakes were not the best I've ever had but the hollandaise was super flavorful. Peach pancakes were just what I expected, which means they were delicious. They served a peach infused maple syrup which I found a little too close to Peach Schnapps (bad memories) but my girlfriend loved it.  Portions were too much for us but the prices were very reasonable. 

Even though I don't live in Mesa I would gladly drive back over there to meet again for breakfast. What a great way to start my day!"}
{"text":"Crackers the staff was very help full the food was on point! The inside can get a new fresh update little out dated but the food and staff its good!"}
{"text":"I realized I wrote a review back in 2014 .... 3 years later, still no gluten free bread options (aside from corn tortillas) .... no gluten free pancakes, waffles, or bread of any kind.
Very sad about this."}
{"text":"I love the blackberry bread pudding. It's addicting so careful. I'm all about the carnitas/chorizo skillet. Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Wow, what a letdown.
To start, service was not very good.  Nobody seemed to be in charge.  Waiter was not attentive.

I ordered Granola Healthcakes With Blueberries And Strawberries.  My gosh, could you be a little stingier with the fruit?  They sprinkled the tiniest handful of fruit on top, so little that there wasn't nearly enough for a little fruit in every bite.  More of a suggestion of fruit than fruit itself.  The granola is obviously not made in house - it's very industrial - uniform, uniformly tasteless nuggets.  

The menu says pancakes are served with \"maple syrup and honey butter.\"  Not so!  Maple syrup isn't even available!  It's just \"pancake syrup.\"  Ewww.  I suspect the \"honey butter\" likewise isn't real butter but probably margarine.  Ewww.  

Breakfast potatoes, allegedly made from fresh, were just okay.

Definitely will NOT return!"}
{"text":"Had a great family breakfast here.   You know the place is good when it is near capacity at 9 am on a Wed.   

I went with one of the house specials....the carnitas chorizo southwest skillet.   I was full about half way through the dish but since it was so good I just had to eat it all.    My wife got the Euro 222 which comes with crepes, bacon and eggs.   We also got a fruit plate which was a great variety of fruit along with a yogurt type dipping sauce. Highly recommended.

Service and atmosphere were nothing special but overall I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area and looking for a breakfast spot"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice but each time the food was awesome and the staff was courteous.  The price is about average for the portions of the food but it is well worth it.  I have only eaten breakfast here so I can not speak for the rest of the menu but I will definitely go back when I have the chance."}
{"text":"Great place I just moved back to az and we went here the next day for breakfast. Nice people and great food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! I had the carnitas skillet added fresh jalapeños it was perfect.  Husband had biscuits and gravy, he would order it again.   Son had the chocolate chip pancakes he thought they were \"too chocolate-y\".      Only bad thing, I didn't like their coffee."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cracker's for breakfast this morning and we had Mariah for our server. She was GREAT! Very sweet and on top of everything, thanks for the great service Mariah!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Everyone at our table had different items and they were each well priced. The menu is pretty large, and can be hard for someone who has trouble deciding. I felt like the food quality was much higher than ihop or Denny's or another breakfast chain, and in most cases the price was also cheaper. 

It lost a star because my water tasted strongly of mildew. Each person in our group tasted it in theirs. We tried water without ice, without lemon and with each individually and together. The taste was still there, so it must be an issue with their water tap. 

All in all, a fine experience, but don't drink the water! (We couldn't taste it in tea or coffee, so it must have cooked off) and try the lemon cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times and each time I say I'm going to order the french toast but always get lured away but something that involves eggs. Guess it gives me an excuse to go back - I will get that custard battered french toast sooner or later. 

The food is good. The prices are reasonable. The staff is quick and friendly. You get in and out faster than you would expect when you see the mob hanging around the hostess' stand, but you don't feel rushed to give up your tables. 

They're in a location that has been several other restaurants before this, so I hope they have the right combination to appeal to a steady breakfast/lunch crowd.

BTW, I'd probably give them four stars but their ice tea is lousy. Yuck."}
{"text":"Went for California Eggs Benedict. The waitress noticed that the spinach and tomato was missing. Thought she would take it back, instead she brought me a slice of tomato and spinach. When I got my check for $9 and some change I gave the waitress three 5's and she kept it. Had to ask for my change. Not impressed today."}
{"text":"I am a breakfast lover and I love coming here. We found this place 2 years ago on a spring training trip and have returned multiple times each year since then. There are several restaurants but I have only been to the Iron Ave location and only for breakfast so can't comment on their lunches.

I really like the potatoes they serve with breakfast....real potatoes, looks like they may have been par boiled and then finished on the cook top. I usually have an omelet one time and the second time have the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon. Wife has had huevos rancheros and also breakfast burritos that she raved about.

Just two blocks off of 60 behind the Home Depot. Located in an office strip and you would never have seen or found it if you weren't looking for it. Have always had attentive and friendly service here and the food is great."}
{"text":"Good dependable place for breakfast. Been here many times. I don't have any particular favorites as I tend to try something different each time I'm in and have never been disappointed. You can expect to wait at peak times, but you'll be happy with your meal."}
{"text":"This cafe is just around the corner from my office, so I decided to give it a shot for a business breakfast. 

I ordered the \"Breakfast Creation\" of two eggs over medium, honey-cured ham and the house potatoes, and my friend/colleague ordered the Beggar's Omelette. My ham was grilled and very good, but the potatoes were very undercooked and extremely greasy, so I avoided them. My colleague said that his omelette was fairly flavorless, and also found the potatoes to be really greasy.

Perhaps it was just bad selection on our part, because the place was definitely hopping at 9:30AM, and there was a 5-10 minute wait when we got there, so they must be doing something right! However, there was lots of greasy food left on our plates for the $30 price tag, and I will probably stick with the Egg & I for business breakfasts in the future."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with a lot of options. I love the southwest skillet. Great service and decent prices. Never had the lunch menu but I'm sure it's great also. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with a few previous review from others. Food quality has really declined from our previous visits as has the service. I'm disappointed as this was once our favorite spot to start our day. Management is practically non existent and not helpful. The older lady manager wouldn't even address our concerns. Too bad. Hope they decide to turn it around."}
{"text":"Great menu!! Terrific service. Had Levi as a server and he was completely on top of everything. Delicious homemade breakfast and lunch options. Breakfast all day!! Get some!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place - pleasant atmosphere, food is fresh and tasty.  Have mostly had breakfast items but did get a soup and 1/2 sandwich one day.  Their spinach and artichoke soup is to die for.  I took 2 servings of the berry bread pudding home once and it was absolutely beyond compare.  Unfortunately, the other times I have been there, I was not going \"right\" home so I skipped it. My only complaint is why charge me $2.69 for a soda when you are only charging me $8.49 for a large platter of eggs Benedict with home fries.  Yes, I know I can have refills but a) I didn't b) I could have gotten a refill and it could not have cost you more than $0.70.  Just seems way out of line to me.  Actually, looking at the menu, all the beverage places are out of line. I don't mind paying good prices for good food and I probably would not have noticed an extra $1.50 for the eggs Benedict.  Just food for thought."}
{"text":"Food - The southwestern eggs Benedict is delicious! The chorizo has just the right amount of spice. Order the potatoes extra crispy! We also had the country fried steak and eggs, which was also amazing. 

Service - Odalys was the best server ever. She was very genuine and always on top of everything. 

We'll definitely be back when we're in town again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I typically get the carnitas breakfast. It's serves as a weekend victory meal after a morning hike. Watch out on Sundays for the rush though."}
{"text":"Crackers has been a long term staple for me, held over from my days as a Mesa resident. You just can't go wrong here. 

Offering breakfast and lunch, everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything i've had was even better. I'd love to be able to say that i've tried everything, but let's be real here- it's a big menu. 

Crackers offers an average of six different soup selections every day, with one or two daily specials. Same with dessert- daily selections may vary. Both are homemade- no boxes or cans here- and they taste like the best thing your mom ever made for you, only maybe a little better. (assuming your mother was a good cook) 

The breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor, the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material. Great stuff. 

Like Meredith said, the decor isn't anything special- it hasn't changed much in the 15 years or so since  I first ate here. I think they're going for homey country charm. It doesn't matter though- this isn't a place to go for ambiance, unless you're a reclusive Mormon housewife. 

Crackers has two other locations- one out in east Mesa and one in Tempe. I haven't been to either of those, but this one is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Perfect diner breakfast. Food was good and came quickly. It was kid friendly and the service was great. I had eggs, potatoes and toast. My husband had the granola pancakes. We shared with my son. He was really happy."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Ordered heart healthy omelet with veggies. Oj and fruit. The waitress disappeared for quite some time.  Did not get a refill on my water until we were ready to leave. Had to wait for the check also. Other than brushing up on there service..the place is good"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place to take my Wife and three of our Daughter's for breakfast that was something different than the normal IHOP run on a late Sunday morning.  

We were around the ASU Tempe campus picking up one of the three Yelp surfing for spots when Tennille (My Wife) suggested going to \"Crackers\" off of Country Club.  My first thought was this is going out of our way and second was the implicit thoughts confusing Cracker & Co with Cracker Barrel.

The location gives this hole in the wall status as it is not on the immediate mainstreet  but in an office strip just behind Country Club.

The service was fast friendly and efficient.  We were a party of five seated less than five minutes after arriving.  The food was so simple but at the same tme amazingly fresh and cooked.

I had the steak and eggs with fruit, potatoes and a side of pancakes.  They eggs (over easy) were perfectly cooked as was the steak and the potatoes were triangular cuts that were not greasy, had the right amount of crunch and softness.  But let me say the pancakes were what got the fifth star because they were thick enough, light enough, not doughy and had a buttermilk taste that makes you wanna slap your Mamma!

No one talked at the table for about six minutes because we were all enjoying the food.  Put it this way, my bill was $81 dollars, I left a 25% tip because it was worth it.  

Now my Wife will never let me forget she told me about this spot she goes to."}
{"text":"The carnitas we're awesome. The pancakes we're huge and tasty! Our waitress Hanne was awesome! The potatoes we're fresh. We have no complaints. I could understand if someone had a long wait but it makes sense if the place was packed cause everything was made to order! Fortunately, we got their really early for breakfast."}
{"text":"My favorite new breakfast spot! I love eggs Benedict and seen previous reviews on it and it looked amazing. I found they have different kinds so I went with the Southwest Eggs Benedict .. Has chorizo , avocado, tomato, with a sauce.. This was amazing!! Potatoes were perfect. I brought the kiddos as well, French toast and chicken fingers .. Amazing.. Great price, great for the family! Service was just as good as the food!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is charming, and the service is friendly and fast. I love introducing friends and family to this gem and I keep coming back for more.
**not giving a 5 star because the hostesses could be a little more helpful e.g. opening a door for someone who has her hands full with leftovers and children."}
{"text":"The waitress tried to hit me with a black check book. Me and my husband went there for lunch.  We walked in, rudely greeted, slammed 2 menus in a table & started to walk away. I said is that our table?  \"Yes\", so I walked toward it. I see her take a swipe at my head out of the corner of my eye. I said \"did you just try and hit me?!\"  She said \"no I was tossing this to the other waitress\". I said ok and started to sit down. The she harshly turned around and said \"Just Relax\" so rudely. I asked to see the manager. He apologized & offered to give us free lunch. I don't want your free food. What I want is not to be accosted when I go to your restaurant. I have no confidence he took it seriously. We walked out. This was our first experience at this restaurant, and last."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts, huge portions! They use all fresh ingredients. The sausage gravy actually has chunks of tasty sausage in it!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! I am a FAN! Damn, that was good. I ordered the \"granola healthcakes with blueberries and strawberries\" and they were deee-lisshh! I highly enjoyed my meal, however the server was a bit hard to find when we needed something, but thats okay. The granola healthcakes, as they call them, were a bit different then what I was expecting too but they were still good none the less. My fiance ordered the Southwest Carnitas skillet, and it was good but HOLY GREASE. Just a tad too much grease for the both of us, he had to stop eating it because the grease was horrible. All in all, I will definitely be back and I recommend you do so too if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant! The service is always great and the food here is killer. My boyfriend has tried almost every skillet on the menu and he has yet to be disappointed. I usually go with the blintzes but I've also had the egg sandwich and the tuna melt and everything has been awesome!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Arizona Grand for a staycation and since there are a lack of options for breakfast there, we ventured out.  My husband had the California Benedict which he enjoyed.  I had the traditional breakfast with eggs and hashbrowns and bacon.  The bacon was the best part of the meal.  They didn't get my egg order right.  The kids had chocolate chip pancakes, which was basically pancakes sprinkled with chocolate chips.  The reason for only two stars is that the place lacks any personality, is a big open room with tables in rows.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal or the restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Although we were seated right away, our server  lacked customer service. He kept walking in and out of what looked like a private party room that was currently not being used. All the other servers would also go in and out of this room with utensils or just go in and gossip. Coffee was only served when we arrived and at the end of our meal because we had to request it otherwise, I am sure we would have never received a refill. Ordered a Daybreak which is a cinnamon French toast with eggs and bacon. I was told syrup would be coming right up and after waiting a good 8-10 minutes we had to remind him....Again! This is my first review on Yelp but I felt that it was needed since we will never return."}
{"text":"Consistently perfect! I love the eggs Benedict here so much! It's hard to find a place where the eggs are always poached perfectly and runny and here they are! We always have to get one fluffy pancake on the side too. The wait staff is friendly and they make sure my iced tea is always full. It's always worth the small wait for a table."}
{"text":"We eat here a couple times each month, and have never been disappointed in the food or the service. Crackers has a very impressive breakfast and lunch menu, and they also have additional \"specials\" each month in addition to their normal menu. Service is prompt and attentive, and the food is well prepared. For coffee drinkers, it's nice that they bring you your own carafe so that you can refill your own cup as needed. They do get busy on the weekend, so you can expect a moderate wait time on those peak weekend brunch hours. But then again, that is to be expected at a good restaurant, right?"}
{"text":"excellent breakfast... great bacon sold here!"}
{"text":"SO GROSS! This place used to be good, but is AWFUL now. WHAT HAPPENED??? Every surface is greasy, food is bland now, and the service sucks. Houston we have a problem."}
{"text":"Much better food than I expected. Inside is loud, but there's plenty of shade on the patio. The side potatoes were the most shockingly good. They must use garlic infused olive oil to cook them.

They give you a carafe of coffee; the decaf is bold. And the service is very attentive."}
{"text":"don't be put off by the location in an ugly industrial park.  inside the restaurant is very nice and we really enjoyed the food.

i had one of the skillets and it was quite tasty.  i would definitely come back, and recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast in northeast phoenix area."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in Phoenix. Weekend brunch is a lot of fun but no alcohol."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place and I was very pleased. There was a little hiccup but the waiter was quick to correct it. My ordered didn't come out with my brother's ordered and I just kept waiting thinking it would be coming soon but nothing. Our waiter came by to check on us and realized I hadn't got my food, he apologized told me my plate was on them and we wouldn't be charged. My plate was delivered mins later.

 I ordered the California eggs Benedict with potatoes and they were both amazingly good. If you enjoy Eggs Benedict this is  definitely a must try. It's a change up from the typical eggs Benedict with a perfect combo of bacon, tomato, spinach and avocado. The potatoes are definitely on point too! Can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much that it has become a weekly routine for breakfast. The breakfast is amazing -- my favorites are the cinnamon french toast and any of their skillets.  They recently added chocolate chip scones to the menu, thanks to my recommendation! I have only had one of their sandwiches and have no complaints there, either. This location is a little hard to find, but is definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had breakfast here yet then I don't know what you are doing with your life.  Everything on the menu is fantastic and the nutella crepe reminds me Thailand street food.  Coffee is not bad either."}
{"text":"Pretty average breakfast spot, but they get the 4th star from me because their bran muffins are out of control!! I like how you can substitute your side with a fresh baked muffin. Cut that muffin in half and melt a little butter into it and every single bite will melt in your mouth. Good Lord!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast.  I had Crackers Arizona Burrito which was loaded with carne asada with the perfect portion of potatos, eggs, and spices.  It was topped with sour cream, pico, and cilantro.  The staff was super friendly and made us feel at home.  I highly reccomend this spot and will definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food, staff and service are EXCEPTIONAL!!  The only reason I wouldn't rate them a 5 star is that almost every time I come here I have to wait for a table!!  I wish they would expand so they could service more people.  Other than that, this place is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood breakfast spot. It's kinda hard to find and parking is a little funky but that adds to the charm for me. Real good food with standard prices."}
{"text":"Biscuits & Gravy For Breakfast!!! Love picking up to-go when I don't feel like cooking in the am!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was fresh, the ambiance was great and the servers were very attentive and friendly. I found this gem down the street from my hotel room. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family loves coming to the Mesa Cracker's for breakfast and sitting on the patio (weather permitting of course)!  We always receive such wonderful service and food!"}
{"text":"this is a hidden gem. the staff was wonderful, great service and priced very reasonable. definitely plan to go again."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's my go to for breakfast. Any time someone comes in from out of town I bring them here. Everything on the menu is wonderful. Try the crepes! The crab cake eggs benedict are a must! The staff is awesome. Never had a bad experience. Be prepared for a long wait for a table though. Some days they are packed but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I had the carnitas skillet and my husband had the classic Benedict. It's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"I have ordered oatmeal here many times - not because it is the tastiest item on the menu, but because I am counting calories.  A few days ago when I was here with a group of friends, the oatmeal had an unpleasant texture and the accompanying raisins were dried-out and tough.   I didn't want to spoil the occasion, so I didn't say anything or send it back.

Yesterday, before a return visit to the restaurant with other friends, I called and spoke with Mark, the manager, who asked me to identify myself when I arrived.   This time the oatmeal was good, and I was happy.   When our check came, there was no charge for my order.   That was excellent customer service, and I will be back."}
{"text":"I used to work a mile from this place and miss it so dearly.   The food is fantastic and reasonably priced.  At one point, I went to this restaurant 5 days in a row because i was addicted to how great it was.  This is certainly my favorite 'breakfast-type' place to go and I am so glad i just found out there is another location in mesa/gilbert."}
{"text":"The portions served here are obscenely huge. I have been here before for lunch, but mainly this has been a breakfast option. Try their huevos rancheros, which is very good but more on the mild-spicy side, or the cinnamon swirl French toast. They also often serve daily specials that are not on the regular menu, and I recall once ordering a fruit-topped French toast here that was simply delicious. When ordering an omelet, my choice usually has been the country garden, and it is really filling. They do have Cholula Mexican hot sauce available, which makes me happy, as many places just serve Tabasco. When I say that the portion size is remarkably large, I mean it. There have been times when I have joined family here for breakfast, and three of us opted to share one of their French toast plates. Trust me, it can be done, and quite comfortably."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I've eaten here multiple times and also get take out.

Their breakfast steak is great.

Staff is great too."}
{"text":"wonderful wonderful friendly service and breakfast. sat outside but the whole place has a comfy family atmosphere. down home cooking!"}
{"text":"Really like the chicken tortilla soup AND love, love  the poblano pork carnitas melt. As for the restaurant, I feel like I it is a chain diner. Split the sandwich and enjoy a bowl!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a google search and was not disappointed. Great service, very good food. Has a home town diner vibe and seems to be pretty popular. Brian was attentive, friendly and energetic. Great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Crackers until I visited, and I didn't realize it was a chain until just now!  I have been seriously missing out.

Fiance and I stopped by for lunch, having been called in from the street by the signage.  My first impression was that the cafe felt very classy.  I ordered hot tea as part of a plan to stave off an oncoming cold (didn't work) and was presented several options in a box.  Nice.

Opting for the lunch menu, I chose a roast beef, tomato, avocado melt (not what it was called on the menu, but the name has slipped my mind).  It came with a side salad and a pickle spear.  I absolutely loved that sandwich.  Hot, it was an A+.  Leftover for lunch later, it was a solid B+ still, and I didn't even warm it up.  I'd go back for that sandwich alone."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I love their food! the blintzes with berries, o wow yum. and the eggs benedict with fresh , another yeah! wish i could go more!"}
{"text":"A group of my coworkers and I go here every other week for lunch. FYI the blackberry lemonade is to diiiiie for- I order it every time we go. They have delicious healthy options to eat as well! Something for everyone"}
{"text":"Over the last few months, through countless meals of eggs and bacon, sausage and pancakes, juice and coffee, I have become an expert judge of breakfasts... Please take this into account as you weigh my review.

THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST IN THE PHOENIX AREA.

I had the granola healthcakes -- they weren't very healthy but they were good and worth every single calorie! The bfast skillets all looked delicious, as did the California Eggs Benny."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's large so the wait on the weekend isn't bad. Menu is diverse and the food is delicious. Totally recommend the Baja omlette."}
{"text":"We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon."}
{"text":"Cool place, surprised we had not heard of it before, but given its location I'm not too surprised: it's kinda tucked in in a very generic looking strip mall.  The food was great! The California eggs Benedict delicious ! Great rich blintzes! The French toast was... ok... they kinda sacrificed custardy richness to achieve fluffiness so if that's your thing you'll like it, for us personally it felt more like fluffy toast rather than true French toast, not sure we'll order that again. Good service, friendly faces, decor is a bit dated but takes a backseat to the great food.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Awesome menu whether you want eggs, omelettes, yogurt, pancakes, waffles, crepes or my favorite huevos rancheros, you will not be disappointed. Something for everyone in a nice but casual environment. Yum!"}
{"text":"The French Toast at Crackers is absolutely sensational and flat-out delicious. I liked it so much when I stopped in Mesa while enroute to Tucson that I came back three days later, had it again, and it was just as wonderful as the first time.

 The wait staff is extremely polite and very cordial, and the hostess (Chris) is an absolute riot with a superb sense of humor and a really sassy attitude.

This has become my can't-go-wrong spot for breakfast whenever I visit Phoenix or Tucson."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  It's one of those places you would never know was there unless you knew it was there.

They have an enormous menu, although I've only been there at lunch time.  I always get the Greek Salad, and it soooooooooooooo rocks!

You just won't be disappointed if you eat here!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember the food being at the Mesa location, anyway.  I'll try it again and see if I feel differently.  French fries were awesome, though!"}
{"text":"I brought my mother here for Mother's Day. The place was packed! They didn't look like it, but the staff was prepared. We were seated within a few minutes. The service was great and the food was excellent. My mother had the breakfast burrito, massive. My brother the crab cakes Benedict, looked outstanding. And I the country fried steak biscuit & gravy, I ate nothing else the rest of the day. Fantastic restaurant, large meals around $10, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"How I have never reviewed Crackers?! Super fantastic!
Tucked away in a random little strip mall behind Home Depot, definitely not where you'd expect to find this gem. But, find it people have, because it's jam packed on weekends. 
Wait staff are always nice, cooked to order food/substitutions with no complaints, and everything is delicious. I've had multiple birthday breakfasts here, had dates here, and eaten many a meals with friends and family--never a bad experience. 
We usually stick with breakfast, but lunch has also been tasty. Omelets, skillets, and sandwiches are all top options. The New Princess omelet is one of my faves! Raspberry iced tea or strawberry lemonade to drink = yum! 
Ate dessert for the first time on Wednesday (some sort of chocolate cake/brownie combo)....holy crap! There were several other options that sounded delicious-- blackberry bread pudding and lemon cheesecake are next on the list. 
Meals here will definitely continue, with some repeated menu items, sampling of the specials, and numerous new things to try on the menu!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times  for breakfast and for lunch. Our longest wait was about 20 minutes on a Sunday when they were pretty busy. Our servers have all been nice and familiar with the menu.  Food  was excellent !  Alot of food, enough for leftovers. Fresh fruit and amazing granola on the pancakes."}
{"text":"Crackers & Co is the answer to a solid breakfast without selling out to the Dark Side aka Denny's or IHOP.  The portions are generous and you can't go wrong with any of the eggs benny plates which are Crackers creations.  Potatoes are not the overly greasy, flavor-free hash you see at most breakfast diners.  This is the place I take my friends and family members when they came out to visit.  I hope they bring this chain to the Pacific Northwest someday.  I miss them!"}
{"text":"Always have lunch late somewhere around 2pm I walked in around 1:52 hoping they wouldn't turn me away cause they close at 2. But with no issue they welcome me in I had to come back they have a amazing steak sandwich that you have to try!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning at around 11 (on a Sunday) and it was extremely busy. Not from here, so just took a chance on a random place. Waited an hour to be seated, and another 45 minutes for the food to come. Got an omelet with the potatoes and it was great. Also we shared a side of biscuits and gravy, that best part of the meal by far. Great breakfast spot, but would recommend trying to miss the rush."}
{"text":"I love this place!
If you're looking for a homey, comfy, friendly place this is perfect.  Hidden behind the Home Depot, this restaurant is great for breakfast/brunch.  I usually get the same thing, the spicy mexican skillet add broccoli and it never disappoints.  The food and coffee are delicious.  The staff is very friendly.  This is a must try spot if you're in the Mesa area :)"}
{"text":"I have lived in Chandler/Mesa my whole life and never gave this place a shot.  I took my dad to brunch here the other afternoon and what a gem! The food was delcious, the staff was great, and the atmosphere was cute and cozy.  Would HIGHLY recommend :)

I got the crepes, and he got the skillet.  Both were absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had in a restaurant. Everything is amazing and the staff is always sweet. One of my favorite breakfast spots! Try the French toast!"}
{"text":"This has become my husband's and my favorite breakfast place. It's right next to Costco and Walmart, which makes it really convenient if you want to grab breakfast before shopping. The food is good, it's done well and the quality is good. My husband really enjoys their pancakes and I really like the way they make their potatoes. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"Good food, fair price, nothing immaculate.  

Had some soup and sandwiches for the table.  Some of the soup was cold when served.  Customer service was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  The service was crappy and the food was medi-ocre.
I got the carnita's omelet and The other famous breakfast place with the big black bear out front beat this one hands down. This was my first visit...and my last."}
{"text":"Always the best breakfast place in the East Valley! Going with the special this morning, the Barbacoa Pork Burrito."}
{"text":"It was no fluke or stroke of luck the last time I praised this restaurant to the sky because I went back there today at the height of the Saturday breakfast rush and it outperformed again. I had Eggs Benedict this time and it was the best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten...and I have had this dish in many of the finest hotels and resorts on the planet. When I asked if the breakfast potatoes were only served plain, she said \"We will make them any way you want!\" She brought it to me with loads of onions peppers and spice sauteed into them,the way they do it at the great classic Diners of NYC, NJ and Baltimore. It's official...this is the best breakfast in Maricopa County! If breakfast and brunch were a religion, Crackers & Co. Cafe would be its cathedral!"}
{"text":"I was in the Mesa location and I had looked at all the reviews so I went and was very disappointed . First of all I did not even seat down and a waiter comes to me and ask me what I like to drink, I told him I am not sure I just came in and he had already an little attitude . So later I ordered a BLT w/ fries and it was terribly no promised seasoned mayo and the bread was very thin ,after I was half done eating I was asked if I would like ketchup.Really?!? Not a place I would revisit again."}
{"text":"Where does one go to escape the working man's district and the monotonous 9-5? Crackers. The menu is fan. Friggin. Tastic. I always get the Roma tomato melt sandwhich. But everything is always good. The soup. The breakfast is good too. very popular at lunch time though. 

You come with a hearty appetite and you leave with a hearty-full tummy!"}
{"text":"Had eggs Benedict for the 1st time. So good  I wanted another  plate! Staff was very friendly as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and attentive. Menu had so many choices it was hard to decide. Crab cake eggs Benedict were good, ask for a little more hollandaise. Eggs cooked to perfection. Potatoes were ok and very plentiful. Stuffed!"}
{"text":"We love Crackers & Co! So far we haven't had anything we didn't like! California eggs benny is one of our favorites. Next time we are going to try the pork skillet - our waitress said it's one of her favorites. This is getting to be a nice time of year to spend a Sunday morning on the patio...."}
{"text":"Love this place for Sunday breakfast! Just a little bit of a wait but we brought the paper and enjoyed sitting outside in the early morning sun. 

The California Eggs Benny never disappoints! Others in my party enjoyed the traditional eggs benny and the traditional breakfast with 3 huge sausage links! Service was the usual, friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I look for new breakfast places all the time on yelp and we found this little gem. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed with bright smiles and seated right away. 
Our server was amazing and the food was delicious! If you're looking for great service and old style american breakfast, this is the place you must come to!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! Great food always!  Unfortunately I have been waiting 20 minutes for my food and was just informed it will be an additional 15 minutes. I wish I was told this upon arrival. I had no clue since there was no wait for a table!  Finally received food and could only eat half since avocados were rotten."}
{"text":"great place for just about any meal.  The soup is always tasty and the portions are plentiful.  well worth giving this place a chance you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had our scooter and lift serviced this morning and the restaurant was in the same shopping center.  This was our 3rd time there and it was awesome as always.  Good service, fresh food and yummy fluffy pancakes.  I tend to be a pancake snob and can not stand heavy thick pancakes, these were light and fluffy.  My husband had the breakfast skillet of steak, eggs and potatoes.  He loved it.   There menu said their soups are all made from scratch daily, but we have not been there for anything but breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast with Rob,  The food is good.  I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  Not my favorite pancakes, but ok.  Love their sausage gravy however."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good meal. Priced fairly and my breakfast even came on a warm plate. Well done. Will recommend and return."}
{"text":"First time having breakfast here and it exceeded all my expectations!  The staff was friendly and our waiter was amazing!  The food was cooked to perfection and delicious"}
{"text":"Pros- blintzes are great, crepes are ok, skillets are good.

Cons- can be a bit of a wait.  Other than that it's just fine."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast spot. I got the giant cinnamon roll was which in-your-face decadent but still enjoyable. I like the tangy creamcheese frosting. The entrees are huge and full of flavor. Great prices, great, quick service."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time for a girls luncheon.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere and quaint surroundings.  It was packed when we arrived, but we had a reservation (highly recommend this).  We stayed well past closing, and they were very polite and did not attempt to kick us out. 

Service was excellent, our waiter was patient with the 2 high protein, 1 full on vegetarian, and one new mommy. We probably had one no dieter in the whole group, so our order was complex, and the waiter just went with it.  Plus he was very entertaining. Always back to the table to top off drinks etc. 

Food is large quantities for what you pay for, very fresh and delicious.  A thoroughly enjoyable outing!!!"}
{"text":"So good! Tried brunch here on a Saturday morning and were sat almost right away. Their menu is huge- and they serve breakfast all day. I had the California Benedict- one of my favorite breakfast dishes. Their famous potatoes did not disappoint and service was very friendly. Good, central location too."}
{"text":"Try the bread pudding...I had the pumpkin bread pudding last time and it was orgasmic. Yup...do it..."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in town. Everything we've tried is fantastic! My favorite is the crab cakes benedict. The most amazing eggs benedict ever! It makes me happy. There is one waitress that's a grump but all the other servers we've had have been great!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this cafe. The food was great, good menu with lots of variety, and the staff was very professional. I'll definitely go back if the opportunity arises."}
{"text":"Who ever cooked my food early today did an excellent job, my potatoes were excellent and my eggs over well done exactly how I asked. My server Olivia was really friendly.
Too bad I am leaving the state today."}
{"text":"Good overall breakfast. Unique selection and the coffee keeps coming. Crepes are good. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"I really like this location much better than the one I previously visited in Mesa on Iron Ave. This location is well lit w natural lighting streaming in and it seems as if the food even tastes better. We enjoyed our meal and our waitress was very attentive. I plan to visit this location in the near future!"}
{"text":"C & C started off really strong then fell off so I will average it out to a 3.  I must use other breakfast spots around town as my marker.  The standout dishes were the California Eggs Benny & the Eggs Benny Florentine.  The free sample of Berry Bread Pudding was deliciouso!!!! The healthcakes were the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  Their food just lacks a little somethin' I can't put my finger on.  I need consistency in my restaurants!  And I know it sounds weird, but I don't like the hazy lighting."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Not only is it reasonable but the food is made with love. I had the Breakfast 222 w/ bacon and the pancakes did not disappoint like most places. They came out golden brown and were the fluffiest things like a perfect cloud, not to mention the bacon was cooked to the perfect crisp. Bae got the farmer's skillet and said it was fire (bomb dot com). The combination of eggs, potatoes, mushrooms, onions & ham gave a burst of flavor that he was astonished with. Not to mention the customer service was on point....highly recommend xx."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Crackers and I have eaten here many times. I have visited all of these locations and the best one by far is the location on Greenfield. They have the best patio and indoor look and feel. All the locations do look the same but the feeling you get from the Greenfield location is just somehow different.
I have had most of the desserts and you really can't go wrong, they are all really good. 
The waffles and pancakes are always delicious and why they have another form of pancakes called \"healthcakes\" I am not sure how healthy they really are! When I asked the server she mentioned little things that might lower the calorie content but nothing major. 
The chicken enchilada omelet is really good and has a nice spice to it. 
My only complaint would be that depending on who your server is you might get an attitude if you ask for substitutions beyond the standard cottage cheese or fruit they will offer. (Like asking for sausage instead of toast and potatoes)
If you go on a weekend for breakfast be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"They were having construction going on in the small parking lot.  Some spots are reserved for other businesses.  Luckily, we found a spot on the left hand side that's open to everyone.  We had a 10-15 minute wait because no one wanted to eat outside in the cool 80+ weather around 9am.

The waiter/server, Levi, was funny and almost served us the wrong order... but ours was the next in line.   No big deal, but it was funny.  

We ordered four different breakfast plates, and they were delicious.   The scrambled eggs were cooked nicely, the bacon was just right, and the French toast was soft in the center, but too hard on the crust.   I almost couldn't cut it with the butter knife they gave us.  The Arnold Palmer drink was just right too.  

I would go back to this place for breakfast the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with our first visit.  I had the crepes breakfast (3 crepes, 2 eggs, with sausage) I added a side of bacon (4 strips) and an English muffin. The \"over easy\" eggs were actually served \"over easy\" not always the case in breakfast places.  The crepes were good, not as thin as others I've had but good nonetheless. The sausage was good (two good sized fat links, not the skinny variety). The bacon was good as well. My wife had the spinach artichoke soup, really excellent, and the Roman chicken sandwich on toasted sour dough, also excellent (they don't skimp on the chicken). Their desserts are made in house and all looked great....but we were too full. Our server, Jessica, was excellent; knowledgable, prompt and personable. When we're \"out that way\" again, we'll stop again. Total with beverage was $25.85"}
{"text":"Crackers & Co cafe is good, but every time I go something just isn't quite fulfilling, and I can't put my finger on it. It's not that I don't enjoy the food, or the awesome chili and tortilla soup. 

I guess each time I go I'm not totally satiated the way I expect to be based on what I read on the menu.

Now don't get me wrong, the food is good especially the salad with pears and gorgonzola. The sandwiches are always good too, but like I said I'm always left wanting in a way that eludes me. But then I just order a lemon square and I'm perfectly pleased and all is well!"}
{"text":"God, I love Cracker and Co. Coma-inducing sumptuousness. On those rare occasions that I order something other than a skillet breakfast, I am always rewarded - I've never had anything that wasn't tasty and cooked with apparent love.  This is some seriously delicious food.

My only complaint is that their hours are too short."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our breakfast items.  He especially liked that the country potatoes that came with his entree were crispy and well-seasoned.  I had the skillet, recommended by our server, that included carnitas and chorizo topped with delicious sauces and served with delicious salsa.  Portion size for my meal was huge and I know the leftovers will be just as tasty tomorrow. Our server, Levi, was energetic, polite, and attentive.   Without GPS we probably would not have found this restaurant as it is tucked away a couple blocks off of main streets."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD. Slap that on my plate, give me a shovel and call my Cardiologist! In a good, and respectful way. This is the food I grew up with, and try to stay away from most of the time... but when you need one of those home cooked meals the world says are \"bad\" for you... go here. What a beautiful sight to behold when the plate arrives!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant needs to expand. The food was great! Our whole party loved their dishes. My favorite were the potatoes that came with the traditional breakfast. The seasoning on them was amazing. The buttermilk pancakes were also very flavorful and fluffy. If we're ever back in the area I would love to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Great, tasty food! We've been here twice and loved it both times. It's very busy, which is a sign of good food, and it's definitely worth the wait. I especially like the crab cake benedict, which has a delicious dill hollandaise sauce, and their home fried potatoes are also great. Our favorite waiter hails from our home state of Colorado, so not only is he a great waiter, we enjoy chatting it up about the Denver Broncos."}
{"text":"Another spot we used to eat when we lived in AZ.  I happened to be in town for business and stopped in.

Their sandwiches are really good with quality ingredients.  The soup is great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafés! It never fails me my favorite dishes are the loaded potatoes skillets. And their service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is hidden and so good.  I have been here many times and every time it is great.  They make their own desserts and the food, so good. I get the roast beef avocado sandwich.  The bread makes the sandwich."}
{"text":"This is hands down my most favorite place for breakfast! Anything and everything I have ever gotten was amazing. I'm a chorizo and carnitas snob being Latina and growing up on the best home made stuff, and crackers is just as tasty! We came yesterday for brunch for my birthday and the waitress was super sweet! She brought out some of their famous bread pudding which by the way was amazing! It was warm and gooey and everything you grandmas bread pudding is supposed to be. The service is always great. My go to breakfast spot never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix visiting for Spring Training and we have our usual spot to have breakfast on the day we leave to go back home. Unfortunately, it was a two hour wait so I Yelp'd another restaurant and Crackers came up. 

Crackers definitely did not disappoint. I ordered the Southwest Eggs Benedict, it was pretty good! Their potatoes are simple but they are delicious! And a huge plus for me, they have flavored coffee creamer!

Definitely a place I would come back to visit if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Went at about 2:15pm on Sunday and didn't know if it was too late to be seated. There was only one other couple in the place and when we checked in the hostess disappeared saying \"hold on\" but never came back. Someone else seated us but there looked to be a bunch of discussion in the kitchen, to the point it made us feel like we were imposing, so we got up to leave. The waiter followed us and genuinely wanted to take care of us, assuring us it was no imposition at all, so we stayed. 

Had the French toast, which was on really thick bread and was absolutely delicious. Tried a pancake but it was still doughy, which our waiter caught and apologized for, and instead of holding them up any longer, I opted for the dessert he offered on the house. The cinnamon roll was also yummy. The skillet with chorizo and carnitas was very flavorful. I love that you can order a pancake, a slice of French toast, potatoes and lots of other stuff a la carte. Prices were very reasonable, too - ended up a lot cheaper than our usual brunch at First Watch. 

A+ on customer service. We felt really welcomed and taken care of. It's a hike from the west valley, but the next time we have a tournament over there, it'll be our first stop. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I remember the first time that I tried Crackers Cafe. I had seen it in the shopping center across the street from where I live and was not sure what kind of place it was. I admit I thought it was just another local business that would be gone within the year. But it remained. It took me awhile to realize it was just a breakfast and lunch place. I thought either no one was ever there or they had closed. Then when I finally drove by when they were open I noticed they were packed and from then on I noticed when they were open they seemed to be jumping. Then I heard some people talking about how good it was so I thought time to try this place out. I was blown away. So good. The second and third time I went there still blown away. I took friends there and they were blown away too. I tried a lot of different things on the menu and they were all great. I liked the fact that they had like 5 different Eggs Benny dishes and they were all different. Who doesn't like variety. I didn't even know there were more than a few ways to make Eggs Benny.
So I continued to talk it up to everyone. It went down as one of my favorite breakfast places and it was local so that was even better. When I joined Yelp last month I thought I have to go to my favorite breakfast place so I can write a review. I didn't just want to write a review from past experience I wanted to write one based on an experience I had just had. So I had some things to do last Saturday morning and after those tasks were completed I headed over for a mid morning breakfast.
Now here comes the giant BUT. If you hadn't seen it coming down the street with all this build up how could you miss it. I so wanted to give this place, my favorite place for breakfast, 5 stars. I had anticipated giving it 5 stars BUT after going there this time I just can't.
When I got there they were busy as usual but there were not a lot of people waiting which was a good sign. I asked for a table for 2 and they said it would be about 15 minutes. Now I could see a few empty tables but thought they must have their reasons. While we were waiting I asked to check out a menu. See what I wanted and help pass the time. First thing I noticed was that they upgraded their menus. Nice and new with graphics looked really sharp. Ok cool they put some money back into the place and got some new menus printed up. Good for them. Then I noticed that they had changed the menu. Eek. What was going on. They went from having 5 Eggs Bennies to only 3 now and a few other things were missing. Ok. Deep breath. Other signature things were still there. Maybe they just trimmed out the things that were not selling as well. We were seated after a few minutes. Waiter came over and was very nice as usual. Ordered our food and it came out pretty quick. My mother is very picky about how her eggs are cooked but they came out perfect and I got the French Toast which was amazing as usual. Our waiter checked on us but then disappeared for the rest of the meal. No refills. No other checks. Nothing. Really? Not even water refills? Come on. Some places will refill your water or soda before you are even done with it. But both my water and Coke were gone long before I finished eating and empty they sat. Then when we were both done eating and our plates were completely bare of any food he finally comes back and asks if we need any take home boxes. No I think we finished all our food there buddy. He did finally bring over a Coke refill for me but that was when we were handing him the credit card to pay.
Now I will so go back. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were having an off day. No one is perfect all the time. Maybe we had a bad waiter. But I was put off that they changed their menu and almost seemed to be going a little corporate. Step up the service guys and if it isn't broke stop messing with it. I have no problem with change but please don't change for the worse. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end of my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars to average out the awesome food and terrible service we received. I ordered the spicy Mexican skillet which was perfect with a side of avocado on top. My dad ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes. Both of our taste buds left happy. However, the service was the worst I've experienced in quite a while. Our server rushed our order and was looking at the opposite side of the restaurant while we were talking to him, didn't refill our coffee, didn't ask if we needed anything else when we delivered our food and didn't stick around long enough for me to ask for hot sauce, and he didn't check on our food to see if we even enjoyed it or needed anything else. When he did finally ask us how we were doing he was walking away as he asked us that and couldn't even hear me asking for a coffee refill. I'm sure he was busy which made it difficult to check in with us often but to not even acknowledge us was not okay. Hopefully it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Update!!! Cyber bullying???
Since leaving this review I've had 3 different messages. Each one was belittling and degrading. Is it possible this is how they keep reviews high? I don't know if this is necessarily cyber bullying. LOL They sent compliments/messages that were belittling and degrading. I guess they just didn't like my review. Oh well, it was an honest review and that's the beauty of Yelp. It gives us a platform to say \"this place sucks.\"
If I get another complement/message I'll let you guys and Yelp know about it. 

Horrible, horrible, horrible. I heard such great reviews about this place.

I had eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was so bland and so were the potatoes. I put salt, pepper and hot sauce but nothing seemed to revive the bland paste taste. 

My friend had a salad. I know it sounds crazy but It had too much junk on it too much stuff and not enough lettuce. 

This was a bad day at the crackers."}
{"text":"I love Crackers, especially for breakfast.  My favorite item on the menu is the Day Break, which includes cinnamon French toast, two eggs, and bacon or sausage. It is awesome.  I add there three berry topping and whipped cream.  
I have also eaten lunch and their burgers are good too.  There are open 7 days a week, for breakfast and lunch.  Breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"I'm literally mad at myself that it had taken me so long to try this place. Cracker & Co Café is an amazing Breakfast and Lunch Restaurant. I had the California Eggs Benedict with the Crackers Country Potatoes. Simply put, it was amazing. The house coffee is smooth and comes with your choice of flavored creams. My husband had the Vatican Skillet and was very pleased with his choice. The only real down side is the very limited operation hours (7am- 2:30pm) which makes the wait times a little more than I usually want for breakfast but it was very worth it."}
{"text":"If you order a muffin, it comes out soggy, like it was frozen and microwaved.  Also stay away from the eggs benedict.  Nasty hollandaise sauce, and barely poached egg.  It was like trying to pass of sunny-side-up eggs on english muffins for eggs benedict.  The skillet was good, and I was told that the coffee is decent."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever!!! I ordered the southwest eggs Benedict and it was really good and had tons of flavor. I also ordered biscuits and gravy which was perfect as well. Everything on their menu sounds good and I look forward to going there again soon to try more. It is also reasonably priced for all the good that you get."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here dropping our son off for college and on the last day checked this place out. Found it on yelp. By far one of the best breakfast we've ever had. Great service, Great food with broad array of choices on the menu. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Every time I have come here the food is excellent and the portions are awesome. The pork carnitas, French toast, and veggie omelet are always on our pick up order. (Always extremely busy)"}
{"text":"I mostly go here for breakfast as I LOVE FRENCH TOAST, especially if I don't have to cook it!  The wait here really has never been that bad with the exception of Mother's Day, but that is kinda to be expected.  I prefer sitting on the outside patio, inside the tables are to close together and it gets very noisy.  The French Toast is on point, it is a very large portion - truth be told I'm a large woman and can eat, but I always split the french toast with someone, you get 3 large pieces cut in half and they are a good 1 - 1 1/2 inch thick slices. The only draw back for me is they do not have turkey bacon.  The staff has always been attentive and friendly.  I did visit another location for lunch with some friends and it was just as delicious.  Great place for a nice family breakfast, definitely going back again and again :)"}
{"text":"In our area of northeast Mesa, this has been our go-to breakfast place. The place is always busy on the weekends, but we have never been let down by the food. One of my favorites is probably the Cali Eggs Benedict! Love the avocado with the hollandaise. Yum!  My mom loves their french dip and boyfriend loves their bacon burger. 

The service can be slow at times,  but the servers, or at least the ones I have had, are always super nice and accommodating. 

The one time I ordered take out for brunch,  it turned out to be a bit of debacle because it was so busy. I should have know though, but the food was still good and packed with all the fixings to silverware to jams and butter. 

We will keep coming here as we have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"It was ok. My food was ok and my server was good maybe I just didn't feel good or something cuz I just wasn't feeling it. I will try it again though. Maybe just what I ordered?"}
{"text":"Stopped by before a spring training game. Excellent service, no wait and the waiter was great. Tried the pork carnitas skillet which is not something I would normally get but I was rewarded with perfect potatoes and tender pork."}
{"text":"My first time coming, long wait to get seated on a Sunday morning, and a long wait after ordering. The servers are all over the place handing out wrong orders to different tables. I ordered the Belgian breakfast. My waffle tasted great and it was a good size! I asked for over medium eggs but they a runny and cold. Maybe I'll come and try lunch.. 

Note: Sunday's are packed"}
{"text":"I would say I love this place, but sometimes it's just good and not great.  But most of the time it is great, that that's the reason for the four stars. Whenever you want breakfast, this should be in your top three choices. I devour their skillets so fast because it's so good.  My wife lives their pancakes, French toast, and their skillets. Lastly please try their baked potato soup,  man it sure is yummy."}
{"text":"Visited 8/5/12..
This is worth it.  
Have been here twice. 
Each time breakfast was great. 

Worth the price. 

Have had omelets, and pancakes, both times good. 

They also have a chicken enchilada skillet for a special which was great.  Going to try the chicken enchilada omelet next time."}
{"text":"I'm from Colorado and saw that this restaurant was near my hotel. I'm glad I came to eat here, they are super friendly and service is fast!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We had the Crab Eggs Benedict and the Southwest Eggs Benedict with a side of country fried steak and a Blitz. The portion sizes are huge. The potatoes are out of this world. Our server Derek was great. We don't ever really write reviews but we were blown away by the food and the service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Why? Why is your turkey melt a cold sandwich with melted cheese?
This review is long overdue. I haven't been here for about 6 months, when I was pregnant. But, I have been eating a Crackers for years, since their original location opened and have always gotten decent tasting food. 
I guess my gripe is really with the menu. I very carefully selected the turkey melt from the menu because I thought it was going to be a hot sandwich. Unfortunately, I was a high risk pregnancy, therefore I followed my doctor's directions to a T! \"No cold meat\" due to the bacteria listeria that can be found in cold meats. So, by the time I got my sandwich I was starving and was most of the way through the first half when I realized the meat was cold. I asked my husband to make sure I wasn't crazy before I called the waitress over. Let me just say, I worked in the food industry for years and I don't like sending food back...
Anyway, the waitress told me the turkey melt is always cold.  What? Every restaurant in my life that I have ordered a melt, it is hot. I felt ridiculous sending half of a sandwich back to be heated, but I wasn't eating it cold. She had to ask her manager what to do. Luckily, someone the kitchen was nice enough to make me half of a real turkey melt. Please either change your menu and call it a turkey sandwich, or let people know they are ordering a cold turkey melt."}
{"text":"Our first visit today. We had skillet breakfasts. They were tasty!! Eggs were cooked perfectly and the carnitas were perfect. Service was fast and the food was good. It was Saturday at 9:30-10:00 Constant stream of people in and out. Definitely not a slow time. We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a hidden gem. Fast service and friendly. I arrived around 11:45 am, I was greeting and seated very quickly. I ordered the BLT with French fries. My food arrived quickly considering it was busy. Every time I eat here, I have a positive experience. I always recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I tried this place after finding it via Yelp while in AZ on business.  It's in an industrial area which is awkward, but I trust my fellow yelpers.

Per recommendations from a bunch of yelpers about the California Eggs Benny, I got that.  Soooo many people said it was the greatest eggs benedict EVER.  I am kind of an eggs benedict connoisseur, and let me tell you people, this was NOT the best eggs benedict I've ever had. It was ok, but nothing to write home about or try twice. 

It's an ok breakfast joint, but their tables are small, so it's annoying for a group because you feel claustrophobic with all of the crap on the table.  Eh."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice.  Had a late breakfast, crowded.  Pretty much any breakfast item you can think of. . .on normal country fare.   Bacon was thick sliced and flavorful.  The menu speaks for itself as far as deliciousness goes.  A little bit of everything.   They have quite the dessert list as well as selection of beverages.

I'm not  a big breakfast fan, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter had the chicken enchiladas omlet. I had the carnitas chilaqules. Everything was delicious and service was amazing fast. Just wish I lived here do I could come back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered the granola pancakes and they were fine. I was disappointed that they didn't cook the granola in the pancake. The food took a long time to come out but our waiter gave us one of the meals for free. The service was good but the food was slightly disappointing."}
{"text":"Pork carnitas skillet and pork carnitas sandwich are YUMMY! My husband always gets eggs benedict which look so good. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see that Crackers only has a 3.5 star rating here. I've only been twice, so take it for what it's worth, but both times I had really positive experiences. 

Crackers uses good portions of great ingredients. I had a steak sandwhich, which had tons of steak, delicious onions and peppers, plenty of cheese, and probably half an avacado. I definitely recommend this plate, but more importantly I think it's indicative of how they prepare food. My girlfriend had some variation of a French Dip- same story.

Service was consistent and food was timely. Prices are reasonable, you're going to be out around $10 for a plate of food, drink, and left overs.

Unfortunately no booze here."}
{"text":"My sisters and i do quarterly brunches and for the past 4 times, we've come to Crackers & Co.  We like it's central location, the fact that it's locally owned (an old coworkers family owns it) and that their ingredients seem fresher and not Denny's-like at all.

The ambiance is good for a couple eating breakfast/brunch/lunch or a whole gang of gals (like us).  The tables have good enough spacing so that when my loud-ass sisters and I get together there, we aren't completely annoying those around us (yah, and we do get loud, I tell ya!).  Their staff has always been attentive and we've always tipped well because we know we are plenty to deal with.

I do wish that they were more consistent with their breakfast fare.  I have always ordered a variation on the standard Eggs Benny (one of my faves!) and they always seem to come out different each time I've ordered them here.  The muffin isn't toasty and is instead soggy or is super toasted; the hollandaise is tangy or it's super tangy; the potatoes are crispy or they're soggy... it's a gamble if I'm going to enjoy my food or find something off about it.

Sadly, because of the inconsistent food product, my sisters all voted this upcoming quarterly brunch to find a new place to replace C&C.... so, now I'm on the hunt for a comfortable, locally owned, affordable, filling breakfast that can put up with 11 women.. yeah, good luck, right?"}
{"text":"The perfect traditional breakfast!  Lots of other varieties, going to have to return and try them all.  Very friendly and not afraid to say... Merry Christmas!  Love them!"}
{"text":"It's ok. 
My spinach and artichoke soup was very good. 
My burger was so-so. 

It's really loud in here and has the feeling of a buffet - so I am not a super fan of that. Other than that, the staff was good. I guess it's just not my type of restaurant. I picture my grandma there on a Saturday at 4pm for the early bird special."}
{"text":"Time again for a quick and concise review.  If you are looking for those long reviews that talk about nothing but jargon move on.  If you want to read something that is long and boring to most read the book The Spanish Ulcer. 

Time to review the food.  I ordered the nutella crepes, side or chorizo and a lemon square tart thing.  Crepes are crepes and they were good.  There were not rolled with the nutella.  They were folded in quarters and drizzled with it.  The waitress suggested some sour cream for the chorizo.  I expected it to be spicy and it was mild in my opinion.  The gem of the breakfast was the lemon square cheese cake thing.  It was really good.  I like lemon, so it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"A must try Nutella banana crepe! The crepes were cooked just perfectly, slightly crispy which is awesome! The fiancé got the Benedict eggs. It was so good that we inhaled it! Either we were super hungry or because it was sooo delicious.  It gets pretty busy, but the wait wasn't too bad. Customer service was excellent in this area. No complaint in this spot. Happy customers will come back."}
{"text":"How in the world did I not know about this place until a few weekends ago? I never realized just how deprived my life had been until my very first trip to Crackers & Co Cafe.  The breakfast skillet I tried was the closest thing I've had to a religious experience in a long, long time. And the service was AH-MAAAA-ZING!!!! The atmosphere was very pleasant and family-oriented.

Finally.... a reason to get up early on a Saturday morning!!!!! And for the ridiculous amount of food you are served, you'll have breakfast on Sunday morning as well.  :)"}
{"text":"I probably would've given this a 4.5, if I could've..but not because of the service, or the food--both of those are amazing (especially the skillets)...  The prices might be a little higher than some surrounding restaurants, but they're still pretty decent for what you get.  The ambience leaves a bit to be desired--the tables are a bit cheap and the restaurant has an industrial feel to it.  But the service and food are BOTH 5-star!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Crackers per a few friends recommendations around 11am for brunch. It was busy and the wait time was about half an hour. Once we were seated, our waiter came to get our drinks order promptly and came back soon after to get our food order. There were 4 of us & we ordered the California Eggs Benedict, the Southwest Eggs Benedict, the Day Break, and Bandito Omlet.

For whatever reason, everyone's food was brought out before mine & I didn't get it until about 5 or 7 minutes later. My dish was the California Eggs Benedict which was just alright. The bacon was crispy and tasty but the hollandaise sauce along with everything else was pretty bland. I also had asked for the side of potatoes to be extra crispy but they were not .. Or I guess only about half were. I'd say that for the quantity, the price was worth it, but not so much for the quality of food. Everyone enjoyed the items we had ordered but no one was overly excited about them. All and all, it was just okay."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. I've been there several times and have not had anything I didn't like.  They have a wide variety of breakfast foods and sandwiches, soups and specials. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had the pork carnitas and it was a hit! I get them every time I come and I'm never disappointed. They also have my Bigelow Cranberry Apple tea that I can no longer find in the stores any longer. I will def be back again, thanks Brian for the excellent service!! I know it's time to leave because they are officially closed but I'm stuffedddddddd! Gimme a few mins hehehe."}
{"text":"Service was very slow in spite of it not being very busy. It took almost 15 minutes just to get coffee after ordering. The food then took another 15-20 minutes and came out at different times. The server also messed up the payment method (part gift card, remainder credit card). Unacceptable. 

The food was good but it didn't outweigh the bad service."}
{"text":"Star # 1-for my breakfast plate the 2, 2, 2
Star # 2-for my husbands biscuits & gravy
Sta3 #3-for my daughter cinnamon roll pancakes 
The end. 

Like momma always said, if you don't have anything else nice to say.... *shrug*"}
{"text":"I'm a waffle person.  I NEVER eat pancakes.  But today I ordered the special. Brown sugar and banana pancakes.  I DIDN'T EVEN NEED SYRUP! THIS PLACE IS DEFINITELY A HIDDEN GEM.  I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Always on point, and if something is messed up they fix it right away.  I love this place. I will try everything on the menu! Everyone should eat here at least once.  But that's all it takes to get addicted."}
{"text":"Great service, great food great value. All the plaudits are well deserved. I'm just sorry we're only visiting here. Best breakfast I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"The server didn't have to request a good Yelp review out of the next table over.
They were probably gonna get a good one anyway.
Great breakfast skillet, very good service.
Hard business. Earned his tip and this review"}
{"text":"A great breakfast and lunch spot in an unlikely location - hidden in an industrial strip. I used to work right around the corner and this is where we always took our clients and had our company lunches. The salads, sandwiches and soups are great. Everything on the menu is homemade and delicious. My favorite items on the menu are the Roast Beef Avocado Melt, Pecan Honey Dijon Salad, Cream of Spinach and Artichoke Soup, Chicken Tortilla Soup. If you're in the area, drop in."}
{"text":"Great service and menu selection. When visiting the Mesa area again, will return!"}
{"text":"I had to convince my husband to come here because there was a 25 minute wait...which turned out to really only be about 10 minutes. 

I have no clue what the bad reviews are about because we left Crackers and Co full and happy and ready to head back for another visit! 

I had the California Benny. Everything was garden fresh, cooked perfectly, and so good. The California Benny is Eggs Benedict with avocado and fresh spinach and so very good. I could have easily shared this plate with someone else. I was too full from just one of them (two come) that I didn't even have room left to eat those yummy potatoes! 

My husband had the carnitas with chorizo and potato egg scramble. I think if we had been alone he would have licked the plate. 

There was no room left in our bellies to try the desserts but they all looked wonderful!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. My favorite item to order is the traditional eggs benedict. Seriously by far the best I have had. Pancakes and french toast is also fantastic. Everything else I have no clue because I consistantly order the benedict!"}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the negative reviews either- I've been here multiple times, and the only miss I have ever had were the crab cakes.  Every other sandwich, burger, salad, breakfast skillet, french toast, that I have ordered has been fabulous.  Coming here for the last two years, this location has been a model of consistency in food and good service."}
{"text":"Wow.. I haven't had a less than spectacular experience at this location. The food is fantastic and the service is on point!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with this restaurant. Just started working nearby and this will now be a local spot for lunch. First impression was great.  Waitress, restaurant manager were some of the most professional I've seen in a while. Unfortunately, the patio had recently been sprayed for pest control and given that we were the closest table to the patio we did find an insect crawling on the table. However, the manager came out, explained, apologized and made things right for us. This will definitely be a restaurant to come back to!"}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast for lunch and it was pretty tasty. I got the chicken fried steak and the gravy was amazing. The portions were big. Overall a great meal!"}

{"text":"We eat here frequently for both breakfast and lunch.. The food is great, service is excellent, every thing is prepared fresh without having to wait very long at all.  The staff and management are very courteous and friendly. They recognize us and go out of their way to say hello and make sure we have everything we need.
The food is great. I have tried many items and have never been dissatisfied. I highly recommend the steak and eggs Benedict, its the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Crackers has been my families go to breakfast spot for over 10 years. With an assortment of great options this restaurant has something for anyone who loves a breakfast. 

Craving a savory protein breakfast? You can't go wrong with one of their skillets, my personal favorite is their Southwest Chorizo Carnitas skillet. Looking for something more on the sweet side? Look no further than their Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. They offer traditional dishes as well that are equally as delicious and appetizing, but it really isn't a surprise for a well rated breakfast place to have a good cheese omelet."}
{"text":"I used to work in east mesa and would frequently meet with friends for lunch at crackers and co.  

Let me start by saying this was over a year ago, but I never thought to write a review because we always called it \"that place where the servers treat you like crap but has great food\"

That pretty much sums things up, the food is AWESOME (salad are a must and Red Velvet cake will make you touch yourself) getting seated might take 10 minutes, water will take 15 and food probably about 45....maybe things have improved with a horriable economy?  Last straw for me was a BIG BLACK CURLY HAIR I pulled out of my cake one afternoon.  BAKED IN!!!!  

It pains me to even think of it still.  Patronize at your own risk!"}
{"text":"The best Omelettes ever! My wife and I eat at Crackers & Co a couple of times a month. Great prompt service and the food is always excellent!
We highly recommend them."}
{"text":"My sisters, my mom, and myself stopped in on a whim for lunch one day and were blown away by not only the food but the service.  It is simple food such as sandwiches and soups, but they make you want to try every item on their menu.  We ended up bringing my dad back the next day to try breakfast because our lunch was so good.  We also went back another day for lunch with the whole family again (6 of us), so not exactly a small party.  We had a different server each time and each one was as good as the last.  One even had another employee run and buy grenadine for a drink my dad ordered.  Even when we modified orders to our liking or added soups and whatnot, they were always willing to accommodate.  It is well worth stopping in and the employees earned their tips with the above and beyond service they provided.  I am looking forward to visiting AZ again and heading to Crackers for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, EXCELLENT! Great food, fast service and affordable! Server was amazing and the cafe was cozy. We sat outside on their patio which was very comfortable and breezy."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was really good. I got a cinnamon roll to start and a southwestern bene. I would order both again. Staff was great."}
{"text":"Yumm! We came on a Sunday morning and expected a wait. We were seated right away and our server was great. We both enjoyed our meals and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a group. They have such a great variety. My co-workers and I come once every couple of weeks because everyone can find something. They mostly rave about the Benedicts and I cannot say enough about the Carnitas Melt. We all agree that they have the best cup of coffee of all the breakfast  joints in the area."}
{"text":"First time diner, and I will definitely be returning.

Great atmosphere, Tuscany meets breakfast. Quiet, unlike most breakfast places at 9:30 on a Sunday. This restaurant has plenty of seating and enough partitions to absorb most room noise.

Our server, Byron, was amazing. He perfectly understood our needs, repeated our orders back to us, and ensured we had full drinks and all necessary condiments! Great service is a must for my patronage.

I ordered the spicy baja omelette. Usually omelettes are a safe bet when out for breakfast--hard to mess up, and nothing to write home about--but this was not the case. This meal was super delicious, I might have to inform my mom back home of this well constructed breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"I have been patronizing Crackers & Co since the late 1980's at their first location near Country Club in Mesa when they had literally 5-6 tables.  I happened to be in the area killing time so I thought I would stop in and see what this location had to offer.  

I love the big patio it was quite lovely to sit outside.  Byron was my waiter and he is great! He was so attentive and friendly - I really enjoyed talking to him.

The blackberry bread pudding was amazing as I remembered it to be.  You must try this dessert!  In fact, order this first and if you have room, order something else to eat. Seriously it is that good!!!!

The food quality is always consistent and delicious using fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I cannot possibly say enough good things about Crackers & Co!  Everything I have ever gotten has been amazing. The California eggs Benedict is always a favorite. So delicious and that avocado! The southwest and farmers skillets are also really great. I've also gotten the flame roasted apple oatmeal and was really impressed, and I'm not one to order oatmeal when out for breakfast! Carrot cake muffin is also outstanding. Honestly Crackers has never let me down, it's definitely a must go!!"}
{"text":"Wow this food is amazing!!! I was given a gift card for this place and decided to try it out for lunch. 

We arrived at 1pm and figured we still had a little over an hour to dine in since they do close at 2:30pm. I had never seen this place and let alone didn't even know that it was located right behind the Home Depot. 

It was pretty busy when we arrived but we were seated right away. Our server was attentive and very kind throughout our whole lunch. We were so indecisive on what we wanted to order since it all sounded so good. 

We ended up ordering:

Mushroom burger with a chicken dumpling soup
Bacon cheeseburger with fries 
Their monthly special of prime rib with mushroom sandwich and a potato soup

Both soups were delicious! They were very hot and both were served with crackers on the side. Both burgers were great and full of flavor! The meat patties were both very thick and juicy! We did ask for them to both be well done but both our meats still had pink in them when we bit into them. 

The prime rib sandwich was so good and the meat was perfectly seasoned. The French fries were sooo good we had to order an extra side of them. 

We will definitely be back again but will come at an earlier time to try out the breakfast!"}
{"text":"In Az for Spring Training. Came for breakfast.

Service was great.  Got served quickly, Coffee was excellent.

Had bacon and eggs with potatoes.  I am not a huge potatoe fan for bfast, I had them because it came with. I tried them,  if you like them not just plain, they where good....just not my favorite thing to eat. Does not take away from the meal, just a preference.

I would come back!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food service and courteous..portions more than adequate everything is done from scratch and fresh. Would come here over and over and over.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.. Have had lunch and breakfast... Yummmmmmm."}
{"text":"Such nice, nice people.  I can't say enough about the excellent service.

We had breakfast and the flat iron steak benny was outstanding.  The breakfast burrito was huge and flavorful.  An order of the fluffiest pancakes I've ever eaten served as our dessert.  

I had a heads up about the place being behind the Home Depot and had no trouble finding it."}
{"text":"I love love love brunches! And this is definitely a must. The service is nice and friendly. A table for 2 is no wait at all but make sure to call in advance for larger parties.

Their european crepes is a must! It satisfied any crepe craving - top with berries and apples and more whipped cream...YUM. Their omelets are just as good. I liked their California omelet :) And if you have the room, their warm bread pudding. If you can't tell by now, I love desserts. Get creative and pick something different every time! This is an excellent choice for good ol' traditional American cooking."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write home about but it's a convenient & clean place for a basic breakfast.  I've tried various lunch items, too, and always come back to the same feeling about Crackers - it'll do but nothing really stands out.  I will say that if you are an Eggs Benedict lover I can't say I recommend it here."}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place.

It's amazing, family oriented, friendly and the food choices are unlimited. This is for sure our favorite spot in the east valley.

The server's are always helpful with suggestions and recommendations to try something new.

Possibilities of breakfast choices lunch menus brunch menus they open up at 7 a.m. and I believe the summer hours are until 2 p.m. so you have to make sure you get out here and partake in this wonderful establishment.

It will not let you down at all."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable meal!  The Greek omelet was delicious and so was the Beggars omelet.  Fresh coffee and excellent service made our visit enjoyable. 

Brian was our server and he was friendly and enhanced an already good meal.  We will definitely be back and hope to sit in Brian's section!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy going to this place for breakfast, I'm surprised it's in such an odd location, but totally worth it. I really love the pancakes, esp. the oat berry ones. I wish they were open longer hours so I could go for lunch/dinner one day. Huge menu to choose from, you're bound to find something delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new place on our anniversary. Boy oh boy are we happy we tried this place out!

Everyone I have bring to this place becomes a fan. Their food is always good. I have yet to have a bad dish. The staff is always nice! And they are always busy when we go, this is because they are awesome!

My favorite dish is the multigrain pancakes with fresh blueberries and strawberries on top. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Best Belgian waffles. Upon entering in my gym clothes I thought I was severely underdressed based on the fancier surroundings of the restaurant. Looking around however you can dress as you wish. After combing the city for Belgian waffles and golden corral breakfast only open on weekends I yelped for some waffles. FYI if you just type in waffles waffle fries is what will be searched so make sure you're specific:) the waffles were fluffy, big and the strawberries were fresh. The warm syrup put it over the top."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a delicious crab eggs benedict with hashbrowns. The service was good and the atmosphere is nice, yet casual. We went late on a Sunday morning, but only had to wait about 15 minutes. I would definitely go back.

My only complaint is that I would like *some way* to learn nutritional information. It's not available on their menu, in the store, or on their website. Bummer for those of us with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"California Eggs Benedict.  Too filling for one person but definitely made me homesick for California."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Have come here on several occasions and am never disappointed with what I get. Stop by and check it out."}
{"text":"The Omelette I had was REAL good, even the bread that came with it was good, and the potatoes, I would MOST CERTAINLY return to this place for Breakfast.
Wife went with a Pumpkin Pancakes, which I stole a bite of, and I thought that was pretty good as well. 
Since was breakfast went with OJ (Its kinda like Root Beer hard to kill lol) 
I think I will be returning here, and would recommend them!"}
{"text":"So I'm being held hostage by a couple ex-pat roughneck South African and Colorado copper mining executives while in Hades on earth.  \"Ya hungry for lunch?\"  \" Yeah sure sir\" I say.  Expecting them to roll me into a high dollar steak house or nightclub at 1300 hours, we pull into a dumpy suburban strip mall to dine at Crackers. God I'd love it if there were a Crackers in Alabama.  Anyway, the food was very, very good.  Just sandwiches, soups and burgers, but all excellent.  So next time you are stuck in the PHX negotiating over mineral rights and need a nice place for a long casual lunch, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Breakfast, yes! Lunch, no thanks. Service is always friendly but typically slow. If you go on a work break, be sure to ask for the check with your food. Breakfast skillets are really good, as are the  biscuits and gravy and the omelets. I build my own with ham, cheddar and spinach and it is great. Breakfast is served all day! 

The baked potato  soup is tasty, as is the Southwest salad. The bread bowl soups, side salads and about five sandwiches I have tried are lacking flavor. I would highly recommend trying out breakfast."}
{"text":"How did I not know this place existed?  Actually never mind because it is hidden behind home depot but due to the help of Yelp, I found this place and have been back about 6 times already in the last month or so.  Everything I have had so far is delicious and its priced right."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, but the service is a little slow. I still recommend eating here if you handle the slow service."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast place and food.  Not many non-chain choices in the area so this one is a good stop"}
{"text":"Tried Crackers & Co. for the first time after trying TC Eggingtons the weekend before, and I'd have to say Crackers & Co wins by a star.  

Had the Oscar Crabby Omelet which is a Saturday special, and it was perfect, light yet satisfying.  BF had the Vatican Skillet and didn't finish b/c he got full off of the several bites he took of my appetizing omelet.

Their menu makes you want to come back for more.  Can't wait till next weekend when I can try  the California Benny or Blintzes (crepes)."}
{"text":"Five star breakfast with attentive five star service.  They also have lovely salads, good burgers and sandwiches for lunch.  This is my go to place for a special breakfast, though.  Everything is a delectable twist on something you would make at home.  Nutella and banana crepes!  Cinnamon bread French toast with pralines.  Fresh fruit parfait with homemade granola.
Don't just order bacon and eggs!  Try something gourmet.  You will love it.

There is plenty of parking, easy access off the freeway and long lines for breakfast on special days (ex:  Valentines Day).  Come before 9:00am to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Service is great!!!! Went here two days in a row while visiting the Phoenix area, and the service was superb. Food was great too, good portions and feel like I'm eating breakfast at home."}
{"text":"I frequent this place. Excellent brunch and th right amount. Try the southwest Benedict and pancakes. I like the cookies and cream or the Oreo pancakes. Excellent service. Fruit flavored Lemonades are great"}
{"text":"Yes. I came here because of the high reviews, I'm a dork. : ) It reminded me of Marie Callendar's when we walked in because of the glass cases of pies that were close to the hostess counter.

It's nice that it's so close to my house! Nice breakfast/lunch place other than the obvious Waffle House that's hanging around the street. It's hidden near Home Depot, in an industrialized-looking area, but it has plenty of parking, and we went on a Sunday. We liked sitting in the outside patio area, nothing beats a lazy brunch on a 73 degree day!

I was feeling more like lunch (had the philly cheesesteak sandwich), he was feeling more like breakfast (had the omelette), both were really yummy. Would have had 5 stars if the waiter didn't mix our table with the tab of another table, but was very good overall."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with family and friends for my husbands birthday.  Was a Sunday morning with about a 20 minute wait.  It was pleasant, service was top notch and the food was amazing!!  We had a party of 8 and everyone had a wonderful time.  We have been a few times before just 2 of us and always have loved the food and service.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried so far has been pretty tasty. I especially like their pancakes which you can sub in for any of their hash browns that come with their meals. My only few complaints are that they have limited healthier breakfast items designated on the menu. If you are health conscious you would have to ask your waiter to customize a healthier option. Also every time I drink the water there, it tastes like shit! EVEN WITH LEMON!"}
{"text":"Love going here for breakfast.  The Huevos Rancheros Pork Carinitas are the best around by far!! I have tried them at other places and they don't match up to here.  The service is awesome too.  I recently took my girlfriends parents and sister here also and all of them loved it and didn't have one bad thing to say about the food.  I wish there was one closer to my house.  I want to try other items on the menu but the Huevos Rancheros are too good to pass up."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little breakfast place!  My boyfriend and I woke up late on a Sunday morning and he surprised me by taking me to Crackers.  The weather was gorgeous, so we sat out on the covered patio.  It took me a long time to decide on what I wanted, since the menu listed lots of great looking dishes.  I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was absolutely delicious and HUGE!  It was filled with eggs, cheese, and chorizo (seasoned to perfection), and it came with a generous serving of potatoes.  I loved every bite, but I could barely finish half of it.  Too bad breakfast burritos don't reheat well, or I would definitely have gotten a doggy bag.  I highly recommend Crackers for a casual breakfast or brunch... I plan on going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Had a tasty Sunday brunch with my daughter here! 

They had a good selection of items for children and adults and they also had nice coffee options, like lattes, mochas, and cappuccinos. 

We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for breakfast or lunch. So many fresh and delicious items! The pictures do truly display what food looks like. I had the new Princess Omlette with egg whites and substituted my potatoes with fruit. It was soooo yummy. Although I have had their potatoes with my breakfasts before and they are to die for, I was eating on the lighter side trying to lose some weight, which they were more then happy to accommodate my needs. Sam, my hostess, was particularly helpful when asking questions about what I was able to create before even planning my meal. Great food and great staff. Also great location near Fry's Electronics, Costco, and Arizona Mills Mall!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.

We were seated quickly on the patio, which was a good choice considering how loud it was in the inside. And how about the decor inside? It looks like an outdated funeral parlor.

My wife and I ordered breakfasts: she the blintzes and me the chicken fried steak and gravy biscuits, both had coffee. First off, the coffee is about as good as Folgers can offer. Blech. The food, however, was rather good. We were both happy with our meals.

The service was OK. Nothing to write home about. Our server probably had multiple tables inside and out, so we didn't see too much of him. He was adequate.

Not sure I would eat here again, but I wasn't disappointed with the meal, just not \"wowed\" on any level."}
{"text":"Consistently good for the last 15 years I've been going between this location and their original location. We mainly go for breakfast and it's the only place I will eat chicken fried steak from. Great potatoes. My husband says they have the best waffles.  I've been there for lunch before. I really, really like their soups."}
{"text":"It seems something has changed at Crackers, it's lacking in the quality that it had and I can't place my finger on the problem. Something has changed it was difficult to give it 3 stars"}
{"text":"Big disappointment here. Waited 10 minutes for a table, which is great. People were being seated on order and as soon as tables were bussed. 
HOWEVER, the wait for the food after ordering was twice as long AND the food arrived cold. (Pancakes and eggs). Pancakes were undercooked. Then, the worst of the dining out nightmares: a long dark hair in the pancakes! 
Wait staff was polite and quick to apologize and comped the entire meal. But, why didn't the GM or at least an assistant manager come check on our table??
No reason to go back, other choices are nearby."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come eat! I'm never disappointed by the staff or the food! Luckily for me, this is also somewhat close to home considering there's only 3 (I believe in the valley)"}
{"text":"We went on Father's Day so it was packed but WELL worth it! The biscuits with eggs, chicken fried steak and potatoes breakfast was amazing -- homemade taste for sure. The chorizo and pork carnita skillet was also very good. The cinnamon roll French toast is another must try. Our server, Luanna, made great recommendations, kept up with refills and checking to see what else we might need and was very friendly! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak and biscuits are superb. Chorizo scramble was also good. The portions are hearty so come hungry. We've never had a bad meal here. ."}
{"text":"I learned about this restaurant online when searching for a good place for breakfast. I decided to try it and was very pleasantly surprised at just how good it was. I love this place! The menu had lots of choices. All were very reasonably priced. I ordered the blintzes and they were fantastic! One friend had the steel cut oatmeal and the others ordered omelets. Everyone raved about their food. The restaurant's ambience is nice. The service is excellent. This would be a good place to take kids."}
{"text":"Sign me up as a fan of Cracker's breakfast, just no so much of their lunch.  I have been here a few times now and breakfast has always been delicious.  Service is quick and friendly enough, the place is clean, and the food comes out quick.  They can get busy on the weekends.

The skillets are always good, and the California Benny (with spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes) is one of my favorites, and I'm not really an eggs benedict fan.  I've seen others get the breakfast burrito and the pancakes, all looked great and received great reviews.  Once, I got the Heart Scram (trying to be healthy) and it was alright, I just felt like it was missing something.  Cheese, maybe . . . cheese makes everything better, right?

The one time I went for lunch I ordered a Roma Tomato Chicken Melt (roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and garlic marinated in balsamic vinegar and olive oil, grilled chicken breast and melted provolone cheese on grilled parmesan sourdough bread).  To be honest, the description sounded way more interesting than the sandwich tasted.  Very plain.

For my side I got the chipotle sweet potato soup.  It was pretty good, but on the spicy side (don't get this if you don't like spicy food). 

As Arnold said, \"I'll be back\" . . . to Cracker for breakfast.  
\"Hasta la vista\" to the lunch!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the Valley...PERIOD! If someone can think of a better breakfast place AND THEY HAVE EATEN HERE, send me a PM. I usually write long accounts nit picking places but it would be disingenuous to do that with Crackers. I've eaten at many of hte best places in NY and SF and aside from this place's lack of pretense, the food is right up there with those places. Of course, you will never hear that from someone from those cities but food for food, this place is as good if not better than those places. Furthermore, if you are going to knock it down a star because it's located in an industrial strip mall then you my friend are a fool...no ifs ands or butts, you are a fool.

The biscuits and gravy are better than most places I've eaten at in the Deep South including Oklahoma, Tennessee and Mississippi. The eggs are well eggs...I still laugh when food critics like to critique a place based on their eggs.

The real draw to Crackers is that unik 99% of most diners and famous breakfast places, Crackers actually makes all their own food from scratch including the deserts.  Everything is home made and you can taste it. 

One last thing, if people said they ate here and it wasn't busy, they are lying. This place is always busy. I used to work near it and even when I tried to time the place I couldn't because it has limited hours and its patrons are loyal. Trust me, I'm a Dr. and I'm not Julius Erving."}
{"text":"Yummy! Good breakfast and good coffee. Had the California eggs bennedict.  Very tasty. .large portions..service was good."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  The bathrooms however are DISGUSTING.  If I had seen them before my meal I would never have eaten my breakfast.  If the bathroom are that bad I can only image how the kitchen is maintained.  Caked on dirt in the corner of the floors and the ceiling vent only held to the ceiling by dust."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab breakfast and lunch in Tempe. There lots of space inside and a good sized patio as well. The menu consists of the usual breakfast items and lunch items. My gf tried the eggs benedict with side of pancakes and I ordered the turkey with avocado sandwich. 

My sandwich was stacked with meat and large slices of avocado but didnt fall apart when I tried to eat it. The eggs benedict and pancakes were both excellent with good sized portions.  We'll have to come back next time and enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Their unique twists on food dishes makes this restaurant a must try. Wonderful waiter staff, great food, and pleasant atmosphere"}
{"text":"We gave this place a shot after church and wowser! What a selection and it was great! Portion size was ample and the service was good. If you want a Vegetarian or Vegan dish - they will accommodate. Just tell them what you want and it's done. The atmosphere was similar to a semi-country kitchen but not overdone or cluttered.

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Crackers & Co has great monthly specials, that constantly very and keep the regular menu fun.  They also serve great omelets and from what my friends say very good French toast."}
{"text":"I like fruit and vegetables to go with my breakfast. Guess what Crackers has? Fruit instead of potatoes for only $0.99! The fruit was delicious and fresh. The melons were really good and the strawberries were typical of this late in the season. I liked them, but not as much as when it is height of the season. 

I had the spinach omelet with bacon. What a combination. I have been all over for breakfast and have not had this combo! It was topped with swiss cheese which I thought I would not like but was willing to try it. It was a good touch to the bacon, spinach, and mushrooms. 

The service was great and we beat the Sunday breakfast crowd. The restaurant is comfortable and clean. Our food was brought out quickly and hot. 

Something I always look for when I go to breakfast is the amount of strawberry jams they offer. This place keeps a full stack available. Why this is important is because as a child I hated when they were out of strawberry jam. This happens often. I don't eat the jam any longer, but I still rank a place higher when they take the time to make sure they have strawberry jam. They also have blackberry which Brad and I tried. Not my cup of tea, but apparently someone must like it since there was plenty of it too.

Brad ordered the carnitas skillet. It was a LOT of food. He could only eat half. He was surprised by the tortillas because it was not a thin, pale, cold, tortilla. It had some flavor and weight to it without being too thick. The carnitas and potatoes were spicy enough for him. The green chile was good, but not hat like at home, but for Arizona it passed. He also liked the salsa.

The thing he liked the most was the one piece of french toast. It was HUGE!!! Looks are also deceiving. I saw it and thought that it must be heavy, but it was not. It was light and fluffy and good. I can always tell how good things are by how much syrup he uses. He did not use much. The added touch was also warmed up syrup brought to him with his french toast. He licked the plate and was satisfied.

I have waited to visit this place since I moved here in March. It was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Before the days of good gps and smartphones, the only way to give directions was: look for the second traffic light, then left, right, left, pass the stop sign, about mid-block turn left into the parking lot - if you see the restaurant you've gone too far (not knowing what would happen at the last bend left).  Heck, I still don't know what lies beyond the bend!

Crackers was fairly crowded then and still crowded now, a testimonial to: a good product + good service = crazy word of mouth advertising.  That's how and the only reason I found it!

Over the past 8 to 10 years...nothing has changed!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Good solid American food.  Good place for breakfast all day, although I had the roast beef and avocado sandwich which was very good.  Service was very friendly and really fast.  The waitstaff was very attentive throughout the whole meal.

If you are looking for something very elegant and fancy, this isn't the place.  But if you want great tasting good old-fashion American food for a fair price, this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"\"The Vatican\" skillet is yummy.  But the pancakes are to die for...something about 'em, whether it is because they are buttermilk, or whether it is because the syrup is served warm...I dunno.

Other than that, this restaurant is pretty similar to a Cracker Barrel and the like.  Good, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. The food was amazing and the service was great. Every member of the staff was working hard and it is always nice to see the manager checking on the staff and guests."}
{"text":"I had this best experience with Crackers & Co Cafe this past weekend and I wasn't even there! Here's the story: I live in Los Angeles and my dad lives in Mesa. His birthday was on Saturday, but he was working a 12-hour shift that day and I hardly got to speak with him. The next morning, I called him and he said he was going to take my grandpa to Crackers for my dad's birthday breakfast. It's just the two of them in Mesa since all of us kids are here in LA. Anyway, as soon as I knew where they were going, I called ahead and spoke with the manager at Crackers and let them know it was my dad's birthday. They don't typically do this so I hope I don't get in trouble for posting this, but they let me pay for their meal ahead. The manager on the phone was so nice about it and I'm so glad he made an exception for me as it was all I could do being so far away. When my dad and grandpa arrived, they said everyone was so friendly and kind. The staff even brought him a dessert with a candle. This made my whole day & week, and my dad couldn't stop talking about it. Not only that, but he loved his breakfast! The manager and staff went above and beyond to make our day and I couldn't be more thankful. THANK YOU! Keep up the kindness :)"}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast! Friendly staff and never a long wait, they stay on top of it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times were great experiences. The service is quick, friendly, and just shy of relentless (in a good way - and I don't like to be bothered). Prices are reasonable. The coffee is good. The food isn't the most unique, as with most breakfast joints, but they've perfected what's there. The wife's Spicy Mexican was on point, my huevos rancheros were nothing short of a revelation, and the corned beef hash we shared was crispy, salty, delicious. Do not hesitate."}
{"text":"Super delicious breakfast. If you go when snowbirds are around there is a huge wait so plan ahead. They have an awesome green chile pork skillet and great pancakes. Worth the stop"}
{"text":"Was a great place for breakfast,had the huevos Ranchero pork carnita. S.o. Had the chicken fried steak,both came with potatoes and a very large portion.when we come down tp the valley to visit definitely will stop by again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have only ordered lunch though, but the breakfasts sound good. Service has always been good for me. It does have a chaotic feel to it with tables all over the place, but the food is great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places. They serve breakfast and lunch and have a large assortment of options. The cinnamon roll is delicious and they have a good kids menu with decent portions."}
{"text":"First timer here. Visited around noon on a Sunday. Waited a few minutes for the table. Service was great and the food was good. I ordered from their special menu, Peach Walnut Pancakes. The order came with, two eggs, bacon or sausage. I also got an order of their potatoes. Everything was great but the pancakes were really yummy. Will have to come again for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Fast service, lovely ambience, fantastic food.  I had the Southwest Eggs Benedict which were quite tasty.  Friend had the homemade biscuits and gravy which wasn't half bad (compared to homemade).  Overall I would recommend for singles, couples, and families alike if you're looking for a local delicious eatery!"}
{"text":"Visited Crackers and Co for my boyfriend and I's anniversary. I ordered the Euro Breakfast and substituted with the vanilla crepes. Everything from the eggs to the sausage to the crepes was absolutely delicious. Even the lemonade. We got our food in probably 15 minutes and it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is always packed!!!!  The food is absolutely delicious and the service is second to none.  The atmosphere is very cozy and they also have outside seating.  I always get the Eggs Benedict here and it is by far my favorite.  We used to live right down the street, so it was an easy walk for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Note to self- why pay $12 96 for salad when I can get one for $8 bucks or less down the street. Plus the lesser salad has no ugly yellow lettuce chunks in it. 

7/25/2017. Decided to try another $12.99 Pecan Honey Chicken salad- take out; same results. Chunks of yellow ugly lettuce. Good $$ tossed on gross yellow greens."}
{"text":"Damn this spot is in a pretty random location but the staff is friendly and the food comes out quick here!  Only been here once and got the breakfast burrito but man it was massive and filling.  I couldn't finish it but would love to hit up this spot again when I'm in town.  Great bang for your buck so make it a point to find this gem!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite breakfast places. We had the Southwest Carnita Benny on the monthly special, country fried steak biscuit & gravy and 2 slices of French toast with strawberries. We literally went back for breakfast the next day, it was so delicious. The French toast was fluffy and sweet and the carnitas under the eggs Benedict was full of flavor. The price was also pretty reasonable for the quality and amount of food we got. My only gripe was over the refried beans which tasted like canned beans and, in Arizona, that's just unacceptable. Regardless, we will return!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 5 if I could base it solely on the Blackberry Cinnamon Brandied Bread Pudding.  I love the rest of the food but the service can be iffy sometime so I'm giving it 4 stars.  If anyone knows where to find the recipe I would love it!  I've tried everywhere and no luck.  It was requested in Bon Appetit but they didn't respond to the request.  They framed the request and put it on the wall - strange."}
{"text":"nothing compares to you crackers and company cafe! !!  amazing guests, prompt efficient  and friendly service (including mine) and the absolute best food!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bf for a late breakfast. Our server was genuine, sweet and made sure we were taken care of. We started with the giant cinnamon roll, which was yummy.

I ordered the New Princess omelet with a side of corned beef hash. Filled with bacon, broccoli, onion (and a few other things I can't remember), stuffed with cream cheese and smothered in hollandaise, this omelet was hands down the best I've ever had. It came with these breakfast potato chips on the side that were so SO good! The hash was traditional, just the way I like it.

My bf ordered a begin waffle with a side of biscuits and gravy, sausage links and French toast. He said his french toast was eggier than he prefers but that might just be his personal preference.

Overall great experience- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Crackers and Co for the first time, the atmosphere was great and the waiters were efficient and friendly. They were PACKED but we were seated quickly and we were served quickly too. Honestly it's nothing extraordinary but the food was good and so was the service. I had the cinnamon french toast which was pretty predictable and tasty and their coffee is good too. This isn't somewhere I would take someone to WOW them but if you're looking for somewhere you can order quickly and you get exactly what you're expecting, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great little cafe hidden in the strip mall off Baseline near the 60!  Relaxing patio area.  Peaceful, enjoyable  place with excellent food and all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. My husband and I have been coming here for many years! We love the breakfast and lunch items and bring our family and out of town guests. For breakfast my preferred item is the french toast. It's the best French toast I have tried in AZ, so far. I tend to get the Day Break breakfast that includes the french toast and I sub out the eggs for fruit. The fruit is a small serving and the bacon is usually very good. There was only one time when the french toast was underdone/soggy and not good, and they replaced my meal for another. My husband almost always gets the Spicy Mexican which is a Chorizo skillet with a hot flour tortilla,his go to breakfast plate of choice most places we go. He loves it and some of our friends have gotten it and enjoyed it as well. I don't like it personally, I feel it is a bit on the bitter side. I have also gotten an omelet, it's fine and the California Eggs Benedict which is also good but the french toast is best, in my opinion.  The coffee used to be quite good, most recent times it seemed more watered down. I would rather pay more for good coffee, wish restaurants gave customers the option for premium cups with refills.
For lunch we have tried the Club which my husband enjoys, I get a variation of one of their Chicken sandwiches that I like along with a side of fries that are tasty, we have also tried their burgers that are surprisingly great! They should really play up those burgers, our friends have also been pleasantly surprised by how delicious their burgers taste. I really love their salads topped with grilled chicken. Their chicken is super good and salad greens usually fresh with an exception of 2x and again my meals were replaced without hassle. I love love their Pecan Honey Dijon salad, one of my favs any place. I get it without cheese and light on the bacon, they put a ton of bacon on it! Way too much bacon for someone trying to eat healthy, plus for some reason the bacon on the salad is not as done as a side of bacon, so if you like it soft that's how it comes on the salad. Their warm honey dressing is to die for, you get it if you love salads. I also get the Mediterranean salad which is also very very good.  Both I get with their flavorful grilled chicken, man now I want a salad.
If you come on a weekend be prepared to wait, especially during busy hours. When you have to wait, and there is a line out the door and packed inside, that's when you know it is good!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing!!! I am so glad I finally tried it. It's my new favorite place for breakfast/brunch/lunch!! A MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots when we come to Phx from Michigan. Their Greek omelette is the best and I order it every time. My daughter loves the cinnamon roll pancakes. We are never disappointed with the food or service."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype on this place. Had breakfast here- ordered southwest Benny. Horrible horrible chorizo- hard as a rock and way too heavy- weird seasoning- and I've had a million kinds of chorizo in my day. I know good chorizo when I taste it. It sat like a rock in my stomach. I started getting a stomach ache from it before we even left. My breakfast potatoes were undercooked in some spots. The eggs way too runny. The waitress was awesome though. Coffee was great. My husband said his breakfast was  pretty meh as well. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came in on a busy Sunday for Breakfast. Their was a wait for a table with our large table but thats usually a good sign. Once we were sat we had prompt service from beginning to end. I love that we had our own coffee carafe :) The cinnamon roll was delicious with a cream cheese frosting and the food we all had was perfect. The Benedict was delicious and the creeps were a hit. Overall great experience. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm tired of looking at this on the front page.  Every time I see those delicious looking pancakes cluttering up my page, I want to slather them with butter as if I'm rubbing lotion on a similarly brown beach babe.  Yes! With my hands!

I seriously am infatuated with this place.  I've only been 3 or 4 times, but whenever we make plans to go, I get so excited. That being said let me get specific. The pancakes are good, the eggs (over-easy) are good, and the toast sopping up my running egg yokes are good.  The breakfast potatoes are good, the fruit cup is good, and hell... my coffee is even good.  Oh did I say good? I meant Great!

The service is top notch and they will make pretty much whatever you want (if they have the ingredients and know-how).  Plus, where else can you go to eat breakfast with rooster statues staring at you?

Located behind the Home Depot on Country Club/Baseline, this is a hidden secret of the Mesaonians..."}
{"text":"We drove by this place a few times and giggled.at its name, being Mexican and all, but because.of.the yelp reviews we thought we'd give it a try and I am glad we did.  The service was exceptional.and the food was just as fantastic.  We will be back here.in two years to watch our Trojans."}
{"text":"We met some friends for brunch today at Crackers and Co.  Very kid friendly and excellent food.  Fast service and everything came out fresh and hot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Mesa! Breakfast never disappoints! Love their coffee. Great service! The California eggs benedict on point!"}
{"text":"Crazy large portions and a wide variety, but nothing stood out as amazing from what I ordered here."}
{"text":"Ok people here's the deal, I've been coming to this location for years, the food has always been consistently good, service; impeccable and today was no exception!  Our waiter Byron, provided world class service HOWEVER DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, change your method of payment. 

My friend and I were each wanting to pay for the breakfast tab and after some lighthearted back and forth, She beat me to the punch slipping Byron her  credit card on her way to the restroom. 

Thinking maybe I could one up her, I approached my server asking him if he could kindly run my card instead of hers, This is where it got REAL (ugly)!


He TOTALLY lost his mind!  Yelling at me and causing a scene shouting \" you people need to make up your minds! This is ridiculous etc.\" I mean so loud that he caught the manager's attention, whom quickly came over to apologize for Byron's tantrum and calmly explained the policy to accept the first card given to the server.

 I waited for my friend to return to the table and told her what had just transpired.  Needless to say, she was mortified!  We did however agree to leave him a tip so that he could perhaps BUY  himself a clue on how to treat his guests!  

I was so angry earlier, but have since calmed down enough to halfway articulate my experience with the way I was treated , now it's rather hilarious!  SMH!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant recently with a friend and we had an excellent brunch. I had the french toast with a side of bacon and I must say it's probably the best bacon I've had out in a long time. 

We took advantage of the patio seating and it was very pleasant. The service moved along quickly without being pushy and all in all it was a very nice visit.

My only complain is the orange juice was warm. Really warm."}
{"text":"Love this place,the food is the best,it's always busy from open to close daily. I pass it on my way to and from work. I love taking people here. It's behind home depot hidden but always found. They are kind friendly and worth the stop."}
{"text":"Im big on customer service and our waiter was very friendly. The food was amazing. It was our first time here and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the French toast combo that came with eggs and bacon. All of these were great, but mine were a little on the cool side when they were served. I think my husband's breakfast burrito took a lot more time to cook and they didn't quite have their timing synced to get them to the table while they were both hot. Even considering this, the food was good enough that I will return if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times were excellent.  The first time we phoned in our order for pick-up.  I had ordered the meat lovers omelette with potatoes and pancakes and it was real good.  They provided plasticware, butter, syrup and ketchup for my meal.  The food was so good I came back to eat at the restaurant and Crackers & Co Cafe did not miss a beat.  I ordered the Butterfinger Banana French Toast with a side of bacon.  O-M-G good!  If I was a dog my tail would be wagging.  The service was excellent and we did not have to wait to be seated.  i can see why this place can get busy on the weekends.  I definitely found my new favorite breakfast spot.  I did not take any pics of my food because it came out just like I see in other people's pics so it is consistent."}
{"text":"We were actually really excited going into breakfast this morning... we wanted to try a new place aside from our regular and we were slightly disappointed. 

When you walk in, it has a very cool atmosphere and the decoration and set up is nice. The first thing I noticed was it was all \"tables & chairs\". There was only one booth in the whole restaurant. We went in me, my husband, our 3 year old and our 9month old. 

They sat us at a very small table with 4 chairs. Literally the table was so small for our family of four and we couldn't enjoy our meal because we were so squished and crowded. 

On top of that the food was just OK. The waiter was nice and friendly, but we weren't impressed and we won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Had the California eggs Benedict.  Eggs came out tiny and overcooked.  They brought me out a new one, and had no flavor. Very disappointing.  In the past, thus was an excellent dish."}
{"text":"Just try this breakfast joint coz we were tired of IHOP or the good eggs. Wonderful experiences there. I had the California Egg Benedict and my hubby had the Baja Omelet. Both were very good. Their coffee is better than the diner coffee, a little stronger. We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch or breakfast. Food is always fresh and nice to get the occasional breakfast for lunch."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast with a friend. He goes often, it was my first time. My eggs benedict were hot and tasted great. Our server Bill was totally on it, as he was training a young lady. My friend ordered a soda from her when she walked by our table. The young lady goes to the next table and starts taking orders. Bill comes out 1 min later with the soda. There was no communication between the two of them, so we called Bill out on it. He said he was just listening from behind the bar, while taking orders himself. Good food. Great service."}
{"text":"The country fried stake biscuit and gravy with scrambled eggs was delicious. Subbed the potatoes for a pancake (came with 2 for $1 extra). 
 Canter of coffee to boot came to $14. 
The staff was great. Food came out quick for being crowded. 
  Stuffed and happy and worth the money!"}
{"text":"First visit was good.  Had New England Clam Chowder and a half of a roast beef sandwich with Raspberry Tea.  The only problem I had was it was very hard to hear. The food and service was great. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"You'd never know how good this place is by looking at the outside, so thank goodness for word of mouth. 

It's a cute little place, reasonably priced and not super crowded, my sister and I went for lunch and both got sandwiches. I got the carnitas sandwich which has poblanos and onions on it, and it was absolutely delicious. It's served toasty and warm on sourdough bread, and the fries with it were perfectly crispy!  

My sister also got a side crepe as her dessert and that's another thing I loved. There's A TON of side options; way more than most other restaurants. I love that in a cafe like this. 

Leaving 4 stars instead of 5 only because the service was painfully slow for us, and we couldn't quite figure out why.

We'll definitely be going back, hopefully to try breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"5-star everything.  The bacon.  The home fries.  The carrot cake muffin. (That muffin is more like 10 stars)  The eggs.  The crepes.  The coffee.  The service.  Ty was great.  He was friendly and took good care of us.  Each time he stopped by to check on us, he even spirited away the empty hazelnut creamer containers I leave all over the table.  

And you can't beat the prices.  Mr. M's two-egg breakfast was $7.79 and my Euro crepe breakfast was $7.49.  The muffin was $3.25 and worth every penny.  This was our first time at this Crackers & Co, but it won't be the last.  Perfect all around."}
{"text":"Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"+++service 
+ Good number of options on menu
+/- food 
[3.5 overall]

Service here was excellent; fast and attentive to the customers needs! My waitress kept checking on me throughout the meal, and she grabbed some napkins without me asking when she saw I made a small spill because of my coffee and creamer. 

The menu has a number of options to choose from and I would love to come back to try some more. I ended up getting the crab-cake eggs Benedict and it was.... Okay. I wasn't wowed by the crab-cake at all and I felt like it was far too much breading for my liking. The potatoes were okay, I felt it lacked some of the umph needed to stand out; they were just cold potatoes without much seasoning or flavor. I felt the overall flavor of the meal was lacking and could have done with some more flavor to it and some heat because my meal was lukewarm upon arrival and eggs Benedict is weird to eat when it's slightly cold. 

The restaurant is located in a heavily industrial area, so when your GPS seems to be taking you somewhere odd it's probably the right place. The bright side is, lots of available parking and a wide parking lot even with the many people waiting to eat. 

I would probably come back to give this place a second chance but I would try something else on their menu. Maybe crepes? Dessert? Something else but the crab-cake Benedict."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this restaurant? Everything is top notch. (except the menu appearance, menu covers are worn-out) Service is outstanding and very attentive. Breakfast was worth every penny. Prices are very reasonable. I love the \"home feel\" of the restaurant at Iron wood. Great dining experience"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place! Never loved benedicts so much! I ordered the California Eggs benedict and my husband ordered the mediterranean omlette. Both egg items were exceptionally cooked. The yolk in the benedict was perfect and the crispy bacon just made it even more delighful! Im so glad I stay near Crackers and Co."}
{"text":"I like the selection of food as well as the southwestern style skillets,  but the service was pretty bad. I know we had a group, but the waiters needed to step their game up."}
{"text":"OMG -- on Sunday 8/4/13 Crackers & Co Cafe in Tempe's Soup de Jour was the BEST Tomato Basil with Sausage soup I've ever had in my life. 

YUM, YUM. It was so delicious that I had to get a bowl of soup to go. I just finished the to-go soup tonight for dinner and I'm in heaven all over again. 

Wow - they really need to put this gem on the menu as a standard. Thanks again for an excellent meal. 

I ordered the 1/2 sandwich (chicken salad on 9 grain) with the soup, which turned out to be an outstanding combination. I had forgotten how good their chicken salad sandwiches are as well. 

My 8 year old daughter didn't want anything from the kids menu, so we ordered her a plain, grilled chicken breast on a grilled bun. She was also in heaven. She actually said to me, \"Mommy, this is the best chicken I've ever tasted!\" LOL."}
{"text":"Food was great, very busy. Liked that they had semi-gourmet options at an affordable price.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Crackers makes the best BLT sandwiches and their French fries are delicious.  Our server Tom did an outstanding job. And Jessica the manager is always so pleasant. I go there almost once a week and I will continue to do so."}
{"text":"We decided to try Crackers after seeing it on Yelp. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were seated. We ordered an waited another 20 minutes for our food. 

I ordered the biscuits and gravy, the BF had the Spicy Mexican skillet. We also shared some pancakes. My biscuits were delicious, it came with breakfast potatoes that were also delish after I added some salt to them. The Spicy Mexican, was not spicy at all, and under seasoned, leaving the BF a bit dissapointed. However, the pancakes were very fluffy and good. 

The service was attentive but not overly friendly, which is fine with me. I would return, but the BF said he wouldn't. So I guess it's a toss."}
{"text":"I love Crackers. It's right down the street and the food is top notch. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't have traditional hash browns, which really bums me out. Other than that, the food and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This 4.5 star breakfast gem is strangely located in an industrial park, and not that east to find but worth the hunt.  Popped in for morning breakfast and after drooling over the menu settled on a Mexican breakfast burrito that had chorizo sausage in it along with eggs, cheese etc.  The soft shell tortilla was perfectly heated and slightly crisp,  the portion was huge, and I was able to substitute lettuce and tomato for the breakfast potato.  The rating is is well deserved as the quality of the fresh ingredients, plus the perfect seasoning and burrito condiments make this worth another visit on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is literally the best breakfast place I have been to. I am usually not too much of a breakfast person, but when I visited this restaurant and ordered the Southwest Carnitas with their Strawberry Lemonade to drink, I about cried.  If I want to go out for breakfast, I don't think twice of where I will be going. I am actually going back in the morning to try to start a Saturday ritual.  My fiance ordered the french toast and said that they were the best she has ever had."}
{"text":"The food is good! 
The restaurant was SOOO crowded when I was there, the acoustics make it extremely difficult to carry on a conversation with those at your own table. 
I will not be going back.

{"text":"This place was referred by friends who are foodies so we decided to give it a try.  I'm very particular about  my eggs benedict but never  expectsd my breakfast to be cold. The waiter was great and replaced my breakfast.  It was steaming hot on top,  but underneath the 2nd egg,  my food was cold.  Needless to say I may give this place a 2nd chance but will not order the eggs benedict."}
{"text":"This is Mesa's best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my family's favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley. 

Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting!

I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... it's got great flavor and is delightfully crispy. 

If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they don't skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best I've ever had (I'm not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion!

Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so it's great for those who can't decide between breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Crackers & Co quickly became my boyfriend and I's go to Saturday morning/afternoon breakfast/brunch spot. We have been there at least six, if not seven times, and they have yet to disappoint. 

Yelp won't let me type all of the wonderful things that I feel about Crackers, so I am going to make a quick reference list:

1. The California Eggs Benedict (without tomato) will change your life. I have gotten this every time I have been to Crackers.
2. The blintzes that you eat at Crackers will be the best you have ever tasted. I always want to order 15 to go.
3. I have never had to wait for longer than 5 minutes at Crackers. Even though they get super busy, they are incredibly efficient and make sure you don't have to wait forever.
4. The food comes out fast and hot every time we have ordered it. Don't know how they do it, but they do.
5. I have also tasted the steak eggs benedict (yummo), the New Princess (yummo), the apple pie french toast (not my favorite, but still yummo), and the mexican skillet (HOLY YUMMO).

Seriously. The boyfriend and I adore this place and are continuously pleased when we go there. Love supporting this local chain.

The only \"bad\" thing I could say about them is that they have such an extensive menu! I don't know if I will ever be able to try one of everything! Heeheehee! :)"}
{"text":"We find ourselves going there now after we take our baby for swimming lessons.  She's 10 months.  They always smile at her and say hi.  I hate it when wait staff ignores her as she gets fussy when someone makes eye contact but doesn't say anything.

My favorite is the country fried steak and biscuit.  I'm a fairly large eater and it fills me up!!  Sarah changes up but always seems to be pleased. 

Service is always fast as is food.  Refills on drinks are occasionally slow but not by much

We sometimes order avocado for the little one as she loves them but she usually eats off our plates. She has had nothing negative to say about this place yet.  Then again, she's had nothing to say at all yet intelligible to adult ears.   

Three thumbs up here (one just a little though as its only an inch long)."}
{"text":"A great diner/cafe. Love their menu, not your typical eggs and sandwiches. They all have their own take on everyday foods."}
{"text":"I loved this cute breakfast/brunch place!! The service was outstanding and the servers were very nice and helpful. I tried 'the princess' omelet and it was really tasty. I don't really have anything bad to say about this place. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love the French toast, hot sandwiches, potato soup. Service is always good too with the exception of one or two waitresses. I enjoy bringing my daughter here because it's very kid friendly and love their patio, especially when it cools off"}
{"text":"Decent food good Bloody Mary and mimosa the service leaves a little bit to be desired. They're not quite as attentive as they should be"}
{"text":"\"OH MAH GOODNESS!! OH MAH DAYM!!\"
 
this place is off the chain with goodness! Gotta try the chorizo carnitas skillet! It's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Crackers & Co. has been our favorite upscale Breakfast  spot for years, but today we had their Lobster Omlette Special ($12.99/ea), and it was the worst meal we've ever had here.  The omlette ingredients were mixed into the egg mixture, and over cooked to almost brown.  Asparagus was allegedly in the omlette but you couldn't tell, and the \"side dish\" of asparagus contained little pieces that were tough and chewey The \"Hawaiian\" Roll was just a common Dinner Roll, and no butter offered or present. Presentation was horrible!

I don't know what's happened here, but we will be very cautious if we come back. Sad!!

As an update, before leaving the restaurant, I talked with the Manager who appeared to be genuinely concerned and offered to provide some compensation which I declined. Compensation for me will be to never experience this again. 

Just as a note, we have a granddaughter who is an Executive Chef, who makes sure we understand good quality and presentation, so leaving this kind of review for a restaurant we love is tough!  As you can see from the review Comments, the proprietors of Crackers are right on top of this, so I would expect this will be corrected immediately.  So, \"Thank you Crackers\"."}
{"text":"Great..!!!! Loved it... enuff said. Highly recommended.
Great time, service was splendid and food was superb. Thanks and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast we had the cherry blintz and pork carnitas eggs Benedict.  Great service too-will return next spring training!!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast place that is decorates like my grandma's house. Big portions, Low prices and quite a large establishment so little to no wait, if there is one. The steak and eggs benedict was on point! Server was really nice, and all in all, you just feel like you are going to your grandparents house to eat a massive breakfast. Nothing fancy, just an old breakfast diner."}
{"text":"Umm yeah..AMAZING! Just wrapped up breakfast. Servers were incredibly nice. Faculty is nice but not fancy or cutesy, which I like. Prompt attention to us. Coffee was delicious. I ordered the Butterfinger French toast and a side of one fried egg(need protein) and one slice of toast(because I have to eat fried eggs with toast or risk gagging..don't ask) Egg was cooked perfectly! Delicious flavor with rich buttery yolk. My toast was even good..Not just a utensil to eat my egg with. The Butterfinger and banana French toast was seriously good. Not overwhelmingly Butterfingered, the syrup added enough caramel taste to tie it all together to perfection.  Thick bread and great presentation. Let's just say I didn't share...

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda sad. This place had ask the elements for awesome breakfast. Great unique menu selection, excellent coffee, and reasonable prices. What fell short for me was the good itself. We split a cinnamon roll, which actually mad me sad. Cinnamon rolls are happy pastries and this one just sucked. I'm sorry but it was flavorless and the only reason I knew it was a cinnamon roll was because that's what the menu said it was. I was not expecting Cinnabon goopiness, but something better than the wal mart bakery would have been nice. 
I ordered the princess omelet which was actually pretty good. I love trying what a restaurants signature dish is or.popular item. This was tasty. The cream cheese kinda pulled it all together. However with my delicious omelet was sad, sad potatoes. No flavor, no crisp, just soft sliced potato. What a waste. Oh well. 
So the price is decent for a breakfast joint. The menu is awesome. The food is mediocre, but maybe I just got the wrong day."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We had the Banana Pecan French Toast and the Vatican Skillet. Go early if you want all the ingredients in your dish."}
{"text":"I do like their food, breakfast is always consistently good and very reasonable.  I have come here for business and pleasure and have not been disappointed in the food.  Service is inconsistent but that is really my only critique in this place."}
{"text":"Great Service and Teamwork!!! Crepes!!!!!! OMG Just like my mom's thin pancakes she used to make.... glad I stopped in!!! Great crew here. Hostesses smiling and greeted me right away!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g. bringing someone's toast), but our waitress was great.

Everyone in our party loved their food.  I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?) and blueberry pancakes.  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.  All of the food was awesome.

And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.  Oh. My. God.  I don't even have the words to describe it.  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.

I'll be back.  Not soon enough."}
{"text":"Awesome food with a small town feel. EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely fantastic. The servers are usually friendly and timely."}
{"text":"Very pleased with my first experience. A co-worker informed me that this was the place to go for breakfast and he didn't disappoint. The eggs benedict was one of the best I have ever had. I would strongly recommend this cafe to anyone coming to the chandler/Mesa area."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was delicious. Not to pleased with their seasonal pumpkin spice coffee. I ordered biscuits and gravy it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location after my bowling league would finish.  It was a wonderful lunch spot with awesome food.  I love their soups.  There is another location I believe on Greenfield out near Brown Rd.  I haven't eaten at that one but it looks like a nice place."}
{"text":"I was extremely surprised of this place. I was expecting a cafe like with limited food choice. But omg the menu was very intense but everything on it was amazing and I wanted everything. The coffee is good the food is amazing and service is great! Would definitely come back. It felt so homie and relaxing to just hang out and eat."}
{"text":"Best place in the east valley to have breakfast or lunch. Huge portions so bring your appetite or a friend to share your meal with. I'm trying to order something different on the menu everytime I go. Everything has been absolutely excellent so far. I don't think there's a single thing on the menu that might disappoint. Worth the wait if there is a line. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A friend and myself  were in the area and thought we would try Crackers & Co Cafe. It was not a corporate chain that we knew of and we are all about supporting the local businesses and community. 

When we walked in, we were greeted immediately by a friend hostess and two workers that were standing at the hostess stand. We were sat immediately (we beat the morning rush) and were greeting almost immediately by a very friendly server by the name of Melissa. 

I had the Southwest Chorizo Carnitas and my friend had the California Eggs Benedict with steak (the steak was an extra charge). Both were amazing, had great flavor, presentation, and hearty portions. 

The prices are just a tad pricey. Just under $10 for most breakfast items. Even though the portions are nice, I feel that breakfast should not be quite that much. If the items were about $2 less it would have been perfect. The food and service were above par so I am not going to deduct for pricing. 

Everything was great from beginning to end and it felt great supporting a local business. 

If you are wondering where to have your next breakfast, try Crackers & Co Cafe. You won't be disappointed. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I got the chorizo carnitas skillet. Their French toast is pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"This is a staple breakfast stop for my wife and I.  The Food never disappoints - the staff is mostly great (get a bad apple in the bunch every so often) - but I can only give it 4 stars because the wait can be quite long...  Mostly because the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"The food was good and the $5.00 Bloody Mary was just like I like them peppery with spice and poured over ice. This was a nice breakfast spot and lot  for portions. We had the California eggs Benedict & The Carnitas breakfast skillet, kids had traditional breakfast. It was a lot of food. Next time we go we will consider sharing."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here a few times and the service and food is always very good.  Priced a little high, but worth it."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast. The carne asada skillet is YUM - try it with a little green Tabasco. I also love their breakfast burrito - huge portion - absolutely delightful.

For lunch the salads are fresh and flavorful. I am not a fan of bread pudding but they are out of this world good so save some room - you're gonna want some! My fav on the menu for lunch is their chicken tortilla soup. Best anywhere - but be prepared - it's spicy good. 

I think they are waaaaay overpriced but they do serve nice portions. We used to eat at the one on Iron until the opened the Greenfield location. Both are equality fabulous!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast with my girlfriend. I ordered the country fried steak biscuits and gravy which was pretty good. The potatoes were ok. She ordered a sandwich which that was bland and lacked any flavor except basil. The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"My wife and I along with my son decided to try this restaurant based on the glowing reviews and four star rating. We were immediately seated, which was a nice change of pace considering it was 9:30am on a Sunday morning. This is where the good ended. After we were seated we waited for nearly 15 mins for our server to arrive and take our drink order. We placed our drink order which included two hot lattes. The waters and chocolate milk that were also ordered arrived quickly. After 10 mins our coffee finally arrived lukewarm, no were near hot. At this point we placed our food order. We waited nearly 30 mins for our food. Once the food arrived it was discovered that our order had been prepared incorrectly and we did not receive what we had ordered. We decided to just eat what had been delivered rather than wait another 30+ mins for our food to be remade. The food that was delivered was again lukewarm and lacked the most basic of seasoning. We will not be returning to this restaurant. Very disappointed. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The American eggs Benedict was good but nothing crave-worthy. Decor was dated country kitchen. I prefer more updated (with more light) but it's not a deal killer. Service from their German waitress was excellent.  The hosts and servers were friendly. Patrons seemed to enjoy the food and service."}
{"text":"This place is very popular so we decided it was time to find out why. Unlike many restaurants, it's  not because of a unique vibe or new twist on menu options. Instead, it serves traditional breakfast and lunch options made with fresh, flavorful ingredients. It's a good place for an all American comfort food fix."}
{"text":"The Butter-finger Waffle is delicious! Must try it!"}
{"text":"This is in an industrial park behind a home depot. This place is pretty Large, they have a lot of seats. Breakfast is pretty good and lunch is Better. Food is \"Gourmet Denny's\" its pretty good but basic. Also Cheap and good service"}
{"text":"One of the reasons we always come here, is that the food is fabulous and the waitstaff are wonderful. We love it when we get Warren to be our waiter.  Warren is very personable, he knows the menu very well, and aims to please.  I was a little disappointed in the person who sat us today. She is tall with white blond hair and was very standoffish.  I asked her If there were any booths. she said yes but none were available I said okay tables are fine but she didn't have any of those either and then we finally said  we would on the patio. She placed us at the first table she plopped down the menus and walked away to talk with her friends.  She didn't even ask if this table was okay.  Warren came right away and all my anger at the blonde lady went away.  Thank you Warren."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the restaurant is huge. We stopped by on our way out of town and thought by the looks of the parking lot we would have a wait. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. I enjoyed the New Princess omelette and my husband had the Carnitas Scramble. The staff was super friendly and the food was fast and delicious. I'd come again for sure if I was back in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Another awesome experience at Crackers & Co! Took another friend here for lunch and the food was amazing! My fave breakfast/brunch spot!  About to order some lunch for breakfast for take-out today! This place always comes through on great food!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and this is now my fave breakfast spot! I had the farmer's scramble skillet and a Belgian waffle and it was delicious! The waffle was fluffy and yummy and my meal was cooked wonderfully! The place was clean and not too noisy, and I will definitely be coming back again!  In fact, I'm headed there tomorrow for a breakfast date with my bestie!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I usually go to IHOP or Village Inn and decided to try this place out by my house.  I was thoroughly impressed with the interior and cleanliness of the restaurant, the friendly service, and the delicious food! Will definitely be coming here again, and this is probably going to become our new breakfast spot! Really love the food and the experience here!"}
{"text":"Crackers and Co is down the street from my house, and my fiancé and I decided to try it about three years ago. We LOVE Crackers! We come here every time our cleaning lady comes and we have to be out of the house. The blintzes are my favorite thing, and my fiancé eats the southwest Benedict every time we come (and it's beautiful when they bring it!). I can also vouch for the yogurt parfaits. The kids menu items are enormous, and my son loves the jr traditional. We tried their Bloody Mary today for the first time and I was impressed. The patio is my favorite place to sit when it is below 90 degrees outside. The staff is always exceptional, attentive, and friendly, and management is usually out on the floor working and visible. This place does what they can to make people comfortable and happy. I've never been for dinner or late night, but I will! Weekend days, expect to wait - but it's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! I ate this skillet that was pretty hearty with bacon, sausage, and ham. The potatos were really crispy and top it off with the eggs, you got yourself a great breakfast! 

My girlfriend got the eggs Benedict which was really tasty! That was there special so I'd recommend that if you go there. 

Both dishes were really tasty and you can tell the quality of food is great! Its not a Dennys or Carrows thats for sure, this is a nice mom and pop type of restaurant that makes really good quality of food. 

If your in the area do stop by because you wont regret it. The portions were really great and thats always a plus for me! But someone ordered french toast by me which also looked great also!

It looks like they have a lot of different things to eat that I bet will taste good! Check it out you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"My Sig and I had a fantastic breakfast here! I should have taken pictures but by the time it was considered the plates were clean! Good sign there. 
We were greeted and seated very quickly ( we just beat the morning rush by about 10 minutes. ) Server was extremely helpful happy and attentive! I have to say All the staff we encountered here were \"Bang On!!

I am not the Morning Breakfast type but I liked the looks of the Huevos Rancheros Pork Carnitas, which was very pleasing to the eye and the flavors were very good. i was a very happy camper! My hubby had the Special  Southwest Eggs Benedict but this one had the Hand Dipped Chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy, poached eggs and a wonderful poblano pepper! Again, great presentation. Thank goodness he shared a bite with me.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husbands order was wrong. My plate was the carnitas Benny. It was ok.  Not worth $12. We may come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Here for spring training.  Found this on Yelp and was so happy we did.  It was a place we wouldn't have seen from the street.  Plenty of food and my wife and I shared a dish.  The carnitas omelette is to die for.  Try it."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Kimberly was wonderful! Try the French Toast or the classic eggs Benedict! (Portions are hugeee so check the back of the menu for side options!)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast haunt!  The service is friendly, great coffee and food superb.  The Crab Cakes Benedict is outstanding with a rich buttery crab cake balanced on a lightly toasted English muffin and a poached egg cooked perfectly. There's a layer of baby spinach to help assuage the guilt of the wonderful scratch made hollandaise topping this delight.   The potatoes accompanying the fish are crispy and favorable.  We've only been to the Elliot location but I'm sure both locations are great.  
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would first like to say when I am in town we always make sure to dine at Crackers. We were in the valley last week and took the family out for breakfast. We had the worst experience with our waitress Aury . We have always had such good service but she was extremely rude and she never came back to the table until it was time to leave our check. Unfortunately someone like her puts the restaurant in a bad light. We will be back , but we will make sure to not sit in her section."}
{"text":"Crackers & Co just opened in Tempe in the Costco center on Priest and Elliot. It was packed for lunch today - a mix of Mesa's version of Ladies who Lunch and business types. 

Had the chicken tortilla soup. It was billed as \"very spicy,\" but not so much. Still, very good and packed with chicken, broth and tortilla strips. You could tell its made fresh.

How I've never heard of the other two locations in Mesa, I don't know. Apparently it's famed for breakfast - my favorite meal. Looking forward to trying it this weekend!"}
{"text":"This is based on the service/customer care; I called looking for a nice breakfast place with a patio. I politely asked on the phone \"do you have a patio and do you allow dogs?\"

I was explicitly told that \"yes, we have a patio and dogs are welcome.\"

To my surprise when I got there, I asked to be seated and wanted to verify that my puppy was welcome and the (manager) blonde lady at the reception desk was EXTREMELY rude and said no. I asked who I JUST spoke to on the phone and was told \"she doesn't know\" and sent me away. Thanks for letting me waste my time and drive all the way there.

Simply for this I will never be back-- they lie and are extremely rude and with the abundance of restaurants in the area that do have outside seating it's not too upsetting."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices in a good atmosphere. 

Our family has been regulars for over seven years at the W. Iron location. The food is fantastic, you can't beat it for breakfast and the lunch sandwiches are great. We've noticed a big difference in the staff since managment changed. Many of the new servers are not as attentive as they should be but the long time servers never disappoint. 

If you go on the weekend prepare to wait, sometimes up to an hour. On Sunday if you arrive before 9:30 the wait isn't that long."}
{"text":"Amazing food and decent service! My favorite breakfast spot in the east valley"}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast/bunch. Decided to check it out after a 5K walk near by. Ordered the Chorizo/Carnitas Skillet. Very yummy tons of carnitas but skimpy on the chorizo-maybe a tablespoon full if that. I would definitely come back. 4 stars only because the wait-staff took forever to bring my change back."}
{"text":"I was told that for a great breakfast you have to try Crackers!! Did not know that this place was hiding behind The Home Depot! West of Country Club.. We were not disappointed, the food was great, and the service was super.. We will definitely be back and soon....."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Crackers!?!?! This place is great. Service is top notch, even when it's busy they are very organized. Only open for breakfast and lunch but they do both INCREDIBLY well. They have a very different menu than most places and they do it very well. I would try this place for breakfast first but if you can't make it, lunch is just fine and I believe you can get everything on the menu all day anyway.

{"text":"I got the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were so fluffy. The gravy was so creamy. The country fried steak was cooked perfectly. I'm really not a fan of the potatoes. But hands down one of the most enjoyable meals."}
{"text":"So I stumbled upon this place leaving a friend's house and using the navigation on my phone. I am sooo happy this happened. I was craving biscuits and gravy but hate them whenever I go anywhere (I make them so good myself and no one seems to measure up). I got them here and they were sooo good. The gravy was homemade and looked and tasted like they had a ton of ingredients in it. The biscuits were flaky and good. I got the potatoes that most things come with and they were amazing. They looked like they would be soft but they were amazingly crispy and they had parsley in it and I asked the waitress, and they put a tiny bit of onion powder which just makes them so great. As I was waiting for my bill the waitress asked if I wanted a sample of their bread pudding. Wow! so of course I did even though I was doubling over with fullness. It was so crazy good, the bottom had like cinnamon crispies almost what comes on top of muffins w/ the crunchy sugary topping, and it just made it magical. I can't stop talking about this place and when I told my friend she said she loved it, too and had gone a few times already. They have such great reviews for a reason! I went to the one in Mesa as well."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to come to for Breakfast.  Bring folks from out of town here and try their different creations and omelettes :)  There are a lot of other great reviews posted so read them and go eat :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, little wait time.. but the wait time is low because THERE'S NO ALCOHOL!! So disappointed... My husband and I just wanted a bloody mary with brunch and instead were disappointed with iced tea. :("}
{"text":"I had the southwest Benedict that was recommended by my waitress and I'm glad I listened. I loved the spice and was delicious. Awesome service. Very attentive. Even gave me a to go coffee too !"}
{"text":"The service here was excellent, friendly and efficient staff. The youngest had the French toast and said it was pretty tasty. The oldest had the biscuits and gravy, he wasn't a huge fan but he ate it anyway so it couldn't have been too awful. Between my husband and I we had the euro crepe breakfast and the country skillet, both were delicious."}
{"text":"A local chain restaurant. Good for breakfast and lunches Nothing spectacular or new but fast service, good American style breakfast food and lunches. Definitely a hit with the after church crowd on Sundays. May be a bit of a wait. We went a little earlier around 830 am on a Sunday and got seated right away. I appreciate their waitstaff. They all took turns either running out food or covering each other's tables. Everyone had a smile on their face and were happy to take care of their customers. Definitely go here again.:)"}
{"text":"I come here too often to write a unbiased review :)  It is good food, great service (80 percent of the time) and just a great place to bring friends, family, and out of town folks to.  I believe they would prefer the originality and creativity of the creations found here over a bunch of other chain breakfast places.  Especially their omelette creations, which can go anywhere from a classic denver omelette to the new princess.

Also check out their lunch sandwiches and burgers.  I had their chicken tortilla soup, and it was good.  I hear good things about their burgers too :)

if you got a sweet tooth, check out their bread pudding for dessert.  its moist and warm, and just so very tasty.

Read the other great reviews for more details, i need to focus on my food now."}
{"text":"We have had breakfast here several times.  Both the food and service have been excellent every time. Some of the best omelets I've had!  Portions are large"}
{"text":"Oh wow.  The wait is worth it.  It is difficult to find.   Located behind Home Depot in an industrial are.   Great breakfast terrific. 

Bryon was the server great job."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I had the carnitas skillet with pancakes and it was one of the best carnitas for breakfast I had, definitely fulfilling, my girlfriend got a egg platter as well and she loved it. We got a cinnamon roll and it was great! Definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. I had the California eggs Benedict with home fries. The avocado was perfectly ripe. Only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I did fine a small black hair in my food. I just removed it and kept eating it was too good to stop. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"You would think at 11:30 am on a Sunday they would be on their game? 

Well today they were not had 3 tables out on the patio empty and we told them we would sit on the patio. They said it would be 10 -15 minutes, after 20 minutes those same 3 table were empty, we went inside and told them again that we are willing to sit in one of those 3 empty tables, the manager in a red shirt said they rotate servers on the patio?? 

We were called 5 minutes later and sat inside???

We had 2 bowls of soup and blackberry bread pudding. We ordered everything at once food came we ate and left 15 minutes later, still 2 tables empty on the patio???

They have 4-5 employees standing at the register talking? They need someone to take charge!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast during the week with a friend.  I was really looking forward to it because two different friends had highly recommended it.  The service was not very attentive even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  My omelet and potatoes and pancakes were just mediocre.  I'm not sure I will venture back to this place."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast choice!  typical breakfast menu with omelettes, pancakes, etc.

Service is excellent.  Even though it was quite busy my coffee never went empty."}
{"text":"Decent food at decent prices.  I wasn't blown away by this place.  I was somewhat disappointed since I heard this is one of the better places in town to have breakfast - I have definitely had better elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place more than 3 stars because the food is pretty good, but the uncleanliness of the restaurant prevents me from doing so. There was a significant amount of food under the table next to mine that no one bothered to clean up when the table was turned over, and there was hair all over the counter in the women's restroom. If that's how clean they keep the areas of the restaurant that the customers use and see, how clean do they keep the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Visited Crackers for the second time, this time for breakfast. It was pretty good! I would definitely order the Blintzes again, except I would add strawberries, blueberries and candied pecans! Picky husband liked his too! We will be back! However next time I will pass on the eggs and bacon, pretty basic."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to know Crackers & Co. but this is only the 2nd time I've eaten here. I wanted something a little 'different' and chose the Huevos Racheros adding the Pork Carnitas, bringing the grand total up to roughly $10 bucks. It was good, I guess, I love the dish in general, but I don't know that I'd go running back just to order it again. The big difference was my waiter continually calling me Sweetheart. And not in the genuine honey, darlin' type of way but the you're-my-last-table kind of way. Did I mention, this was around 1 o'clock, and they close @ 2. Overall, not horrible but not fantastic."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great service.  I had the cottage omelet and it was very tasty.  Potatoes were good as well.  Large portions so I had left overs."}
{"text":"I don't come to this location too often. The food is the same as the one east of McDowell out of power Road. This location always seems to be a lot slower getting to your table and bringing your food. But the waiters are very nice"}
{"text":"I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!

I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.

This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is so good! It's one of the best breakfast places around. The only con is that it doesn't have a bar or I would mend all my hangovers here weekend mornings. 

I have the southwestern eggs Benedict. It was spicy but really good! I paired it with some v-8 juice and coffee which was also really good. 

The inside has a fancier italian home type feel. Yellow walls, old looking paintings in frames, and it has a beautiful dry bar and patio.  I highly recommend you check this place out if your a morning person."}
{"text":"First time here and wow this is a cool spot. It's pretty far for me but when you go with the fam and they are paying you join, always. Time is precious and you make the best of it. Had breakfast with the family and we had a seating of 10 people. It's big enough for groups and for that amount of people with the quickness and service was phenomenal. 

Derek our server was on his game. I mean breakfast is nuts in most busy popular places and he kept it together.  He checked in with us often, even though he had many other tables he was poised and calm with us. 

I personally had the cinnamon roll and that is a must order and just big enough that we all got a bite and that was perfect for me. It was so rich and the frosting was perfect. For my main breakfast dish I had the chorizo breakfast burrito with the salsa on it and the side. That burrito filled me up and I only ate half of it. It was a perfect size even if you finish it or just eat half. The tortilla was fluffy and wrapped tight so nothing came out and it looked pleasing to the eye to eat which is always a good thing. Overall please with the food, the service, and the atmosphere. I will be back for sure to try a new dish. Check the pics for what other dishes the fam got."}
{"text":"Man I wish I would of listen to my co-worker a long time ago when they 1st recommended this place. 
My experience was great and the food was amazing I ended up getting the southwest eggs Benedict and man they were GOOD. The wait time was not too bad I think I received my food in less then 15 minuets. The atmosphere was great and there is also outdoor seating if you prefer to sit outside. I think Crackers & Co Cafe from
Now on will be one of my top choices for breakfast.
I'll have to come back to try out different things on the menu and let me see that definitely have an extensive menu. Great experience over all."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad meal yet at Crackers. The food is made fresh and they have a really good menu. The chicken deader salad is awesome and it comes with a warm garlic toast....delish....you must order the waffles, very light and tasty I felt like I could eat 5-10 easy. The condition. Of HH is establishment is good and the wait staff is friendly as well.  The menu is reasonably priced  so you will not break the bank eating there's do the portion size is good also. During the winter months pack some patients as the winter visitors that love in the area love eating here as well.  Yessss mister."}
{"text":"Went for my first time today. 
People have recommended this place and I do not see what there is to like.
I had the huevos rancheros and the beans were soupy and the only thing that had flavor was the corn tortilla. The potatoes they talk about sound good on the menu but are also flavorless and soggy being partially cooked.

Less than half way through my food, I took a bite and CHOMP!, there was a large piece of a ceramic glass dish hidden between the eggs and flavorless beans. I stopped to make sure my teeth were not broken as I crunched the piece into 3 other pieces. 

Asked for the manager and he came out. Very emotionless, he says he will comp the dish. You bet you are!  There was no apology, it was an \"I will take it off your check\" and walked away. 

On our way out, I walked past him again and he didn't say a thing and I do not think he cared anyways. 

Customer service is VERY IMPORTANT. 
Without it, you get 1 STAR yelp reviews and breakfast eaters who will not return."}
{"text":"The food are not bad at all - I'm just not really fan of it. With the same price I can get more food at iHop and actually iHop have better pancake."}
{"text":"Always looking for a great place to eat breakfast, and we have found it!  We had the Breakfast Burrito wiith chorizo.  It was wrapped tightly as it should be so that you can cut it open or eat by hand without any dripping.  The Belgium waffle with apples was amazing.  It  did not have the typical compote that you would see.  They were dry but what a flavor it packed!  Absolutely delicious. the portions were perfect if not a bit larger than what we expected. It felt like it was a family oriented restaurant and very comfortable.  A place that we will visit again!"}
{"text":"A little out of the way but tops Waffle House on the main drag. Excellent service (even when seated in a corner). Server Jason (?) greeted me within seconds and had coffee on the table before I could open the menu. 

So many menu choices and even tho it was lunchtime I was ready for breakfast. Opted for cheese blintzes with eggs and sausage. Perfectly prepared with a light two cheese filling. 

Too bad they're hidden by Home Depot but once you find them you'll go \"crackers\" for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch yesterday. We had sandwiches; hard to mess that up. We were seated in a side dining area. While the dining area was ok until we looked up. The air vents were filthy, along with the surrounding ceiling tiles. Their were also signs of leaks in an area. very dirty, The service was average"}
{"text":"yes once again i have decided to give this mediocre place a try ...don't ask me why, i had the eggs bene as usual the Canadian bacon was a paper thin slice of meat i also asked for some spinach on my bene for some reason the put raw spinach on ...?????? not sauteed .......i asked for the hash brown crisp and basically got potato chips....i kid u not......good bye crackers im breaking up w/u"}
{"text":"I went here last sunday and will make this brief since everyone's covered so much of it before. And my opinion seems to be a square peg. Decorated kind of a cross between cute midwestern farmhouse and currently-popular Tuscany theme. That said, I liked the wallpaper where we were sitting and the lighting fixtures. 

Not to dwell on the decor but the food simply wasn't that good for me. I was initially interested by the crabmeat Eggs Benedict but when it came it tasted just like fish, not crab and it was short on hollandaise. Overall it was average except in the price - the final bill for 2 breakfasts (even \"fancy\" ones) and coffee came to about $25, which seems like a lot to pay. Ok, way too much for breakfast. The coffee (unlike a lot of other places) was relatively good and we were seated asap - a plus but I just don't see going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is top rated. Their food is one of the best I've tasted. I've tried several items on their menu and all have been quite good. You may have to wait a bit if it is the weekend on breakfast but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast I have ever had...My husband and I shared 3 meals because we couldn't decide. We had what the waitress recommended...I had the California Benedict and it was amazing the bacon was perfectly crisp and loved the freshness of the spinach and avocado. My husband had the chorizo carnitas skillet and WOW that was incredibly flavorful. We shared 2 slices of French toast but we should have ordered one because it was huge but best French toast I've ever had so good. The manager knew it was our first visit and gave us a bread pudding and Wow that was amazing too. I will definitely come back here when I am back in town ..LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"As far as I can tell, Crackers & Co has the best breakfast in Ahwatukee...even though it's only barely in Ahwatukee. Still, it has good, hearty breakfasts served by a friendly staff. And, even when it's crowded on weekends, you still don't find yourself waiting too long.

Their French Toast is RIDICULOUS--a gigantic portion of deliciousness. They have some southwestern skillet type that's pretty amazing; and the Eggs Benedict is quality too...as well as most of the other items I tried. Although, if I had one complaint, it's that the food never really comes out piping hot. It's not cold; it's just not super hot either. I like to see steam rising from my plate.

When I want a big weekend breakfast, this is where I head. It might not blow you away, but it's good (and the best breakfast option we have around these parts)."}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast with the bar set high after reading the reviews here and they delivered. 

Huevos Rancheros was amazing. Almost life changing. Almost. The coffee was good too. Service was equally excellent. Thank you yelpers for the solid recommendation!"}
{"text":"This place has been here forever, like since the 80s, and it's tucked away off of Country Club and the US 60. You wouldn't expect much from an obscurely located restaurant, but Crackers and Co is a hidden gem! 

The cons: It is packed on the weekend and the place is in dire need of some interior updating (the tables are wobbly and seating is a bit claustrophobic). Did I mention it's been around for 30ish years? You sort of have second thoughts about your food choice, like is all this chaos worth it? 

The answer is yes. Heck yes. 5 stars just for the food! The food is amazing. The portion sizes are hearty. I love their scrambled eggs and bacon. And for the record, don't count calories when you're here because this is home style cooking, everything has flavor and you will leave stuffed and satisfied. The Soutgwest pork carnitas breakfast is one of my favorites. Service is friendly and quick. The prices are second to none in relation to food quantity and quality. They also do catering!"}
{"text":"Went in recently and left very unhappy. I've been to the iron st location and the service and attitudes are much better. Employees at the Greenfield location are rude and the Management is just as bad. Quality of food suffers here also."}
{"text":"Lovely place. It was very clean and the service was excellent.  My sandwich was large and the fried were plentiful. Will absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"The waiter never gave time to order. She brought the Cheque even before I finished eating and I still wanted to order some more food. I am giving 3 for the food."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict the best love the garlic breakfast potatoes. . Staff friendly and helpful 
They serve breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here. The only complaint I have is the wait time for your waitress to come back to the table, given it is always very busy so that kinda comes with it. Love Crackers!"}
{"text":"Not the \"best\" of experiences...

First, there was no wait to get seated, which is always appreciated. Nothing super exciting about the atmosphere, just a regular breakfast spot with a \"cafe style\" theme.

Food: The food was edible. I ordered the French Toast (my usual at the Tempe location) and it was a bit dry and way too thick... I would say that I ate about half. The bacon was weird, had a melt in your mouth kind of feeling but at the same time it was also very overdone.

Service: The service was slow... and random. I had to wait for syrup until a few minutes after receiving my French Toast (super annoying) and I was consistently waiting for a refill on my coffee. Nice server, but seemed a bit disorganized.

I go out to eat for the food (because I can't cook) and for the service. I guess I kind of expect really good food and attentive service. I don't really feel like I got that during today's visit, however the price was decent. Not a cheap breakfast, but not an expensive one where I felt robbed. I gave this experience two stars for the \"ok\" food and the price that I paid... had the meal been any more expensive, it would've dropped to a one star.

Sorry Crackers, try again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast I've had in a long time! Everything was perfect coming in! The service, the atmosphere, THE FOOD!! I would easily recommended everyone to try this place out for the best breakfast in Phoenix! Our server Brian was phenomenal and helpful, easily made this first visit more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Visited 7.16.17 and left very impressed! The food is delicious and the service great. I got the blintzes with a side biscuit with gravy, my husband got the Calfornia Benedict and we were both very happy with our choices."}
{"text":"Solid place for brunch. Willing to take a call-ahead for a large party so a table was ready for us when we got there even on a busy Sunday morning. The food tasted great too."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs benedict as that is my favorite breakfast dish ever.. I wasnt overly impressed. I will say that it tasted good. But the potatoes it came with were mushy and not very flavorful.. The dish described the eggs as large, i would call them small to medium. The hollandaise barely covered the top of the egg and they charge for more. Boo! Service is decent although i had to ask for a refill.. Probably will seek elsewhere on my quest for the best Benedict's!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at all 3 Crackers & Co. locations and I have always enjoyed their food and I particularly like their Tuscan decor.  My favorite to order is their Pork Carnitas Skillet. It's tasty and very filling. I can only eat half of the skillet and always have the rest in a \"to go\" box.  

I took my 10 yr. old niece at the Greenfield location several months ago for her birthday and she ordered the Cracker's Club Sandwich. The portion was huge and she loved the sandwich. Needless to say, she could only eat a third of it. When Mark, the Manager, a very nice young man, discovered it was her birthday, he told my niece her dessert was on the house. She decided on their brownie and it, too, was excellent. 

Thanks Mark, for making my niece feel special on her birthday."}
{"text":"I've been going here for almost 20 years and I've always had a great experience. Incredible food, and just a good place to sit and chat. I had a bro brunch there and would do it again tomorrow."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but I can always find something great. Good flavors and good service. During busy hours it can really get slammed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! They are always fast! Get there early if you're going on the weekend, they pack up quick!"}
{"text":"Best  breakfast I've had in years and everyone was so nice huge portions.. Eggs made perfect an the coffee is very good."}
{"text":"I love the California eggs benedict here. It is a great place to have breakfast with the family. A wide selection of food on the menu. I only give it 3 stars because the section that the eggs benedict is in, it says you can have toast or sub pancakes. When I ask to sub pancakes they tell me it is an error on the menu and it is written wrong. Every time I go, I get a different response. It is false advertising so it should be corrected. I had one waitress tell me I had to get the side of pancakes for 4 $ then she talked to the manager and got it approved as a substitution then she comes back and asks if I'm going to sub my potatoes. I said no I don't want it if I sub my potatoes. Then she comes back snd says it is fine. At that point I'm pissed and irritated for how many ridiculous interruptions I've had over something so dumb."}
{"text":"I manage a place similar to this in Philadelphia and I have to say this place is  great. Our server Luana was outstanding at her craft and is what a server at a breakfast spot should adhere to. Food was  great and the owner is a doll. Thanks for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We loved this place and visited often.  However, we had a really poor experience last time.

Our waiter was new and wasn't doing the greatest job.  We were fine with it and were willing to be patient because we were there to chat, but after our drinks had been empty for a long time and we were feeling parched, my dad asked the waiter, who was serving the table next to us, if he could get a refill.  

The waiter's name was Byron.  Byron snapped at my dad, which surprised me because he'd been our waiter in the past and I thought he was nicer than that.  In a very rude tone, he told my father that the only way he could help us is if the patrons at the table next to us said he could, because he was there to help THEM.  My jaw literally dropped.

My dad usually stands up for himself but he was so shocked by Byron's response that he didn't even know what to say.  A man next to us said, \"Yes, please help that man\" (Byron made everyone within ear's shot feel awkward).  Instead of getting my dad a refill, he went and found our waiter, brought the waiter to our table and condescended to him in front of us, making all of us feel uncomfortable.  My dad said he felt guilty for asking for a drink... that he had paid for.

We haven't been back since.  Nobody makes my dad feel stupid and gets more money from me."}
{"text":"This place is one of the reasons why I love living in Mesa. 

I first found it when I was working nearby in the one of the most soul-crushing jobs I've ever had.  The only bright spot in those days was the occasional opportunity to grab lunch here and eat it in the vacant lot behind work before trudging back to four more hours of mindless test scoring.

Everything is good, and the value is awesome.  Be prepared to wait for a table, even on weekdays."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast. Everything I've ever had is delicious. I take all my out of town friends here for breakfast or lunch and there has been nothing but raves from everyone. They want to come back to visit just so we can go eat at Crackers. Lunch is just as good as breakfast. I've never been disappointed. Service is very good as well. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place 4 stars but because the service was great I bumped it up a star. 

Got there about 8:30 Sunday morning.  Had to wait 5 minutes for a seat. Not bad, kind of expect that on a Sunday morning.  Got seated and our waitress was right over to take our drink orders.  We had already looked at the menu while waiting and she could tell we were ready to order food too.  She took our orders and promptly returned with drinks and our food came out later. 

I had the chicken fried biscuits and gravy.  It was really good and there is a lot of good that comes with it.  Wife got the day break which also had a lot of food.   Both meals were really good.  

The service was fantastic. This is the kind of service worth tipping for.  Our waitress was Jennifer, and if you get a chance request her.  She was on top of things as soon as she took our orders.  Didn't have to ask for anything (I think she can read minds).  She brought me a second arnold Palmer before i drank all of the first one.  She noticed my wife needed more creamer for the coffee, boom it was there.  When leaving she offered to put my drink in a Togo.  

I recommend this place and Jennifer as your waitress."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Sunday about 9:30am and was seated right away. Our waiter was an odd sort. He was a lazy-day casual sort of guy. He would casually walk around sometimes with his hands in his pockets like he had nothing to do.  He was a nice enough fellow though.  He kept our drinks full which was nice.

My wife had the New Princess omelet and I had the Southwest Chorizo Carnitas skillet.  The dishes tasted as expected. No wow factor. 

One thing my wife and I both noticed was that the servers all around seemed have no ambition, \"joie de vivre\", if you will.  It was as if right before the restaurant opened they were yelled at by the management and now they were sullen.  It was a stress we both picked up on and did not lend to a comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family for Sunday morning breakfast/brunch. Prices were reasonable and my over-medium eggs were done right! Coffee was sub-par and creamer wasn't fresh, and we sat right behind the register area, but other than those minor (and easy-to-fix) complaints, we loved this joint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great café with a large menu to satisfy anyone's tastes. They have delicious daily lunch specials with half sandwich options paired with soup. I'm partial to the potato soup topped with bacon, chives and sour cream! The restaurant can get a little crowded, especially with snow-birds, but it's worth the wait if you have the time. They can accommodate larger parties (we've had a few retirement ceremonies there) and service is always wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife was among two carloads of women who went there a few weeks ago for lunch from our neighborhood ladies lunch activity group. 6 of them became ill later that day with vomiting and diarrhea that lasted well into the night. None of them called the county health department, but at least the restaurant was told. I have no further comment."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times.  It's an ok place.  Good for a basic breakfast.  

Went yesterday with the family.  Had to wait 25 minutes for a table.  Understandable...it was Sunday after church.  Got seated and placed our order.  As we waited, other people came in and were seated.  After quite a while, we noticed that other tables that were seated after us began getting their food.  We then realized we had not seen our waitress since she took our order.  We waited for her to come around but after 45 minutes of no food, no waitress and every other table having been served, I went to find a manager.  

Talked with the hostess who said she was the manager?? And she went to find our waitress.  Waitress finally came out, looked at our empty table and asked us if we had gotten our food.  Huh?  NO!  We still have not gotten our food!  What, did she think we got our food, ate it, cleaned our table ourselves and then went up and were trying to get round two?

So, she goes in the back, several minutes later comes out with our food and puts it down without a word.  No explanation, no apology, nothing.  The so called manager never said a word either.  Nothing.  Everyone acted like waiting 50 minutes for breakfast (after everyone else in the room who came in after us was served) was perfectly normal.  Really poor customer service."}
{"text":"Most of the time I don't eat a big breakfast--just toast or cereal with yogurt. Here I ordered the original parfait that was quite good. It had sweeted yogurt, fruit and granola. The coffee was okay.
Some others in the group ordered large breakfasts of eggs, toast and potatoes or pancakes that they enjoyed.
This is a popular, well run restaurant that specializes in breakfasts."}
{"text":"Employees seem a little snooty unless you are a regular.  Had a party of 7 and business was dying down so they just had to clean off tables and that took little over 10 minutes, but no biggie. The server took a while to come greet us, but came back with our drinks in a reasonable amount of time and tried to take our order but had to come back to get the rest.
She refilled our drinks once and checked on us once. 
We asked for butter and she said she would bring but almost 8 minutes later we had to ask a bussed for it. When she was clearing plates she asked if I was finished with mine and when I replied no, she tried to take my plate anyway.
 You would think a server would offer the bill or anything else when everyone is just sitting around but no. We had to ask. 

So we just got our bill and we weren't aware that gratutity is apparently included so that is why the service sucked. Never coming back again. Food was decent hut not worth the service!"}
{"text":"First thing, the staff was incredibly nice and polite. I ordered the southwest chorizo carnitas skilled. It was very delicious. I would definitely recommend this cafe!!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast brunch on a busy Sunday morning, luckily though we didn't have to wait because there were spots open at the bar.  If your not lucky enough to get a spot at the bar or are dining with lots of people they do allow you to call ahead and put your name on a waiting list. The cafe is rather large but they seemed fully staffed to handle it well. The food was great, I loved my breakfast sandwich it was nicely and flaky and not overly oily. They also have egg substitute or egg whites only. The chef even did one egg and rest egg sub for me so that was nice. Also they're a lot of mostly healthy items on the menu. If your not looking for healthy than the biscuits and gravy were amazing.... Coming from me that's a lot because I hate biscuits and gravy. Nicely and peppery taste to them. I wasn't impressed with the pancakes but I think that comes down to personal preference because my husband loved them. Hubby also got corned beef and hash and loved that. Great locally owned cafe I will most likely be going to again!"}
{"text":"OMG.  I can't stop thinking about my meal here.  Went for brunch on a Saturday morning about 10am.  Got a table for 4 right away.  Server was quick to greet us and brought our drinks just as quickly. 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (one of my favorite brunch items), and hands-down, this is the BEST I've ever had.  No kidding.  It's been 3 days and I'm still thinking about it.  The dish consists of beans, tortilla (I went with flour), green chilis, salsa, and 2 eggs (I got mine over easy) and you also get a side of potatoes.  The potatoes weren't mind-blowing, but the rest of the dish certainly was.  I'm not sure what made it so delicious, but it seemed that every little bite was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.

Husband got the California Benny which he enjoyed, and our friends got a fruit platter (which looked very fresh) and a blueberry muffin (which was literally bursting with blueberries).  This was their 2nd breakfast of the day so they ate light - what a shame!

2 enthusiastic thumbs up for this place, and I can hardly wait to go back.  Of course since I'm going to have to order the Huevos Rancheros each time, I'll have to make hubby try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent as always. Fresh food, great service.
Fries are coated with something which makes them especially crunchy and flavorful but still soft on the inside."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their soups, particularly the artichoke one. All of the food is really good and so is the service. The deserts are nicely made."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot. I enjoyed my favorite... California eggs Benedict. But Levi made it more  magical  with his charming style and excellent service! My whole family enjoyed him.  We will return again and again."}
{"text":"I L O V E the California eggs Benedict!! The service was fantastic (guy with the goatee and loud voice is great ) I'm paying next time though... just sayin'"}
{"text":"This place made the whole family happy. Good food. Good service (Tad)."}
{"text":"I got the chorizo Benedict for breakfast this morning. I'm full and satisfied, but I wish I'd gotten the classic. The eggs were undercooked and I think that kind of ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Great healthy options and awesome baked goods . I got the carrot cake muffin and it was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. We had the crab cake benedict and the loaded potato skillet. Both were amazing. The portions were large and took half home for dinner. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely great service and great food. It's rare these days to find that combo!!! Pick this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after reading the reviews. Very good food. I had the Healthcakes, and I'm no heathfood nut. Very tasty. Great atmosphere too.

Well worth a look."}
{"text":"I've given this place two tries.  I forgot how \"bleh\" it was the first time and tried it again.

Still bleh.

\"Country Potatoes\" are almost without flavor at all.

I had the Spicy Mexican skillet the first time.  Fairly tasty, but nothing about it wowed me.

I had the Greek omelet this time, and it again failed to stimulate the taste buds.  A little over-done on the outside, and nothing overly tasty about the overall presentation.

I left half of it on the plate, along with most of the potatoes.  

I can't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Mesa, hands down.  I've been eating at Crackers since high school (I now have a daughter in HS) and I was so excited when the one opened on Greenfield.  Expect to wait for a table because this is a popular place for breakfast & lunch.  Do yourself a favor and order the bread pudding, it is delectable."}
{"text":"The breakfast an the service is amazing! I have the tiramisu pancakes, which was one of the special.  I did wish there was a little more of the tiramisu cream in the middle, but I just didn't ask for more.  This place is a little hidden gem! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything I didn't like. Good food and a very fair price.  The French toast are very cheap and huge portions.   Hey don't take my word for it , try it.  Tell them I sent you"}
{"text":"First time here with my honey.   I had the garden omelette and he had the peach pancakes both were outstanding!   Reasonably priced good service"}
{"text":"By far, the best breakfast restaurant in AZ. We just moved here and have not been highly satisfied with any of the restaurants we have visited. Thumbs up times 5! BTW, waitress Kim was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the place for a quick, good breakfast.  My vegetarian omelet was good, fluffy with plenty of cheese and vegetables.   I was able to sub fruit for the hashbrowns.  The service is good as well."}
{"text":"We reserved this place four years ago for a very large, 80th birthday party for my mom.  There was a slight snafu with a few diners waiting awhile for food, but we had 40+ people there, so it mostly awesome.  Last year, my mom, sister, and I went back for our annual day-before-Mother's Day brunch.  It was great.  This year my mom wanted to take all of us out for a pre-Christmas lunch, since she's unable to host anymore.  We were so saddened for her at how completely awful the service and honestly some of the food was.  Both of my parents are hearing impaired, so they requested a table outside.  They sat them close to the road.  There were PLENTY of other tables that would have been on the patio, but not quite so close to road noise.  We had no less than 6 different people come to our table at different times.  We waited at least an hour for our food.  When they finally brought our food, they rudely blamed the delay on the fact that my sister ordered a hamburger.  There were many, many other unprofessional comments, delayed responses to requests, and other missteps.  We thought perhaps since they put us so close to the road, maybe it was too far for them to pay attention, but there were others on the patio, and they put us there.  There's no excuse for unprofessional comments and taking an hour to put together a meal for 6 people.  We all felt horrible for my mom, because she was just trying to do something nice for us.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Food a solid 5, service this visit a 2. I'm sure that's a fluke, and will update when I go back.

Our server was bad. We were happy to get seated right way when entering on Sunday morning. We were given our menus and told our waitress would be right with us. Yeah, not so much. Took her quite a while to come on by, so we ordered our food along with our coffee. Brought our coffee pretty quickly. Our food came pretty fast, but was not delivered by our waitress. Didn't see her again for a while, which was very annoying as we both wanted water. She finally showed back up and we asked for water. About 10 minutes later, still hadn't seen her (she wasn't serving any other tables in our area, which was probably the problem). A lady with an assistant manager badge came around and we finally got water from her. When it was time to pay the bill, I left my card with my friend as I went to the bathroom. The waitress came while I was gone, but there was some confusion and she didn't take the bill. We sat there at least 15 more minutes before she finally showed up again, right as I was going to ask someone else to please take care of our bill for us. 

Food was EXCELLENT, so I'll return for sure. Hopefull with a different server. Had the traditional breakfast: eggs with cheese, fried potatoes, sourdough toast and country fried steak. All hot, perfectly cooked, very delicious. My friend had the blintzes, said they were very good. I know they looked great!"}
{"text":"Knocking my review down a star because of my group's experience yesterday. 

Had another work lunch there. There was about 14 of us total, and the service was pretty sub-par. She had no idea what food went where, drinks were the same. Very few refills. My cup stayed empty of water for more than 10 minutes, I asked for a refill, and it still took another 10 minutes to get one. And then they were out of iced tea...even when they were going to be open for at least another hour and a half. How does that happen??? 

One girl didn't get her ranch with her meal. She brought it back really quickly, but had already forgotten who asked. She took it to the opposite end of the table. 

I had the Wednesday special. Chicken Parmesan sandwich on a grilled Italian roll with fries. Sandwich was ok. I actually perfer the same sandwich at Mimi's. The fries were really good! Glad I got those over the salad. My friend was picking out the slimy lettuce from her salad. 

Thankfully this time we went with one check, as opposed to the split ones from last time. I would have hated to see how she handled that."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a cup of coffee and a blueberry muffin. The muffin, coffee, service, and dining room were all about as average as they come. This was about as average a breakfast experience as you can get. 
Given a choice, I would prefer Mark's Cafe or US Egg (both in Tempe) for breakfast. 
Parking is plentiful and close to the door."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a party of 22. I'd never been to this location but it was nice to see that they were able to accommodate all of us. The place is sparsely decorated. But you don't come for the ambiance, you come for the food. The menu was extensive and it seemed most items could be modified. Sadly with a table this large our food came out in rounds but all arrived within a reasonable amount of time. The room fell silent as it was obvious everyone was enjoying their food. Everyone fully enjoyed their meals and only a few didn't make the clean plate club. A great place to meet for large groups for breakfast and the food was good and hearty. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Even though the location is behind the home depot, the restaurant is very cute (with rooster art everywhere) and everyone was very nice. At 9am on a monday, the place was busier than i would have thought. The spicy mexican skillet was delish. Plenty o food. My hubby got the beggars omelette. He swears that the coffee has pancake syrup in it but our server has told us otherwise. Its douwe egberts coffee. Try it. Youll like it."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Crackers!

To drive by this place you'd never know what to expect inside. The exterior is rather nondescript, but once you step indoors you'll find that the decor has been updated since the facility was originally built. Albeit a bit dim inside, plus it's a bit strange to see the bar in one corner of the dining room, it makes for pleasant breakfast environment.

The service was polite and prompt and that California Eggs Benny (pictured) we're quite colorful, tasty and, I like to believe (due to the spinach,) healthy. I would definitely consider visiting this restaurant again.

My only criticisms are minor. The restroom was clean and neat although beginning to show its age due to outdated decor. I also didn't care much for the plastic tablecloths. I prefer solid (unprinted) cloth or no tablecloth at all. These, of course, are purely aesthetic and not major detractors.  Free WiFi would be nice for those of us who like to catch up on morning news via our smartphones.

Got a large family to feed for breakfast? Crackers maybe the place for you."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite breakfast place. Truthfully I am not crazy about breakfast as it is my least favorite meal of the day.  However when it comes to this place I suddenly become a breakfast freak.  I highly suggest any of the eggs benedict dishes.  I usually go for the California.  Which has avocado and bacon.  Hash browns are on the side and my plate is always clean with nothing left on it after about 15 mins.  I had never had eggs benedict before eating here and have tried it at numerous other places since my first visit but, NEVER have I found better.  Believe it or not I have even started cooking my own eggs benedict because of how amazing this place makes them.  After many attempts that turned out great this place still beats me.  This place is to die for and many of my friends from central Phoenix will ask to go here if they are visiting.  Truly the best!!!!"}
{"text":"We come here every Sundays after church for breakfast!
it's one of our favorite breakfast spots ever! It's usually busy that day so I suggest you call and reserve if you don't want to wait.  This place is a cute little cafe, the staff is awesome, the food is great and you get pretty big portions for breakfast for a good price. My all time favorite would have to be the California Benny and my boyfriend always gets the Princess Omelette. My boyfriends dad is in love with their Country fried steak. He said it's better than Cracker Barrel's and I would have to agree on that.  We tried almost everything on their breakfast menu and I can't really think of a dish that I was disappointed in so I say go check this place out!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend who told me I was going to love my experience. AND I did. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. The service was exceptional and everything looked so good. The restaurant was very clean. I highly recommend you try this place. I live in north Phoenix and will make the trek to eat at this excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Second time in to this location... First time for breakfast. It seems that we had a staff member wait onus who was either new or just oblivious. Started out by only bringing one of my kid's drinks and gave the excuse \"I had to set it down because the tray as off balance\". Great so now I have to explain to y kids why one has a drink and why one doesn't. Thanks guy. Also, I do not need excuses why you cannot carry a 10lb tray from point A to point B. I have done it. It is not hard. Following that, when we ordered our food, he did not explain that the chicken in the omelet a cone pre-seasoned or that the fruit cups have melon in them. Good thing the fruit cup was not on my plate or I'd be in the hospital right now. As for the chicken, it ruined my appetite and ended up not eating it. Side note: all other food was good according to my bf and kids. After that the server presented us a bill while we were still enjoying breakfast... No warning, no asking if we were even done or ready for the check. Just assumed we needed to leave. Well that was very hospitable. Regardless of his rudeness the manager amended the situation. But I hope thy waiter gets some training... You know who you are."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast this last weekend and after reading the reviews and listening to my friend who had already been here, I was excited to try the breakfast.
Let's just say I have had better and was not impressed. Maybe it is this location, or maybe it is that I just expect more for breakfast, but I thought this restaurant was both a waste of tummy space and money!

I ordered The Vatican Skillet, which was dry and lacking a lot! It needed sauce, salt, pepper, you name it, it was missing it! Took most of it home and ate it later all fixed up. 

Will not be returning..."}
{"text":"I tend to grab my favorite every other week--Fruited Chicken Salad! I'm addicted to it, especially the lemon ranch dressing. 

You can't go wrong with most of the breakfast items as well. Large portions and very delicious! 

My only complaint would be the fries. For some reason they always have a burned, oily taste/look to them. Out of all the places that sell fries, Crackers and Co make the worst ones. Other than that, I will be coming back for my regular fix!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in the area. Great skillets! Be here early on a weekend the wait can be long. Service is generally good."}
{"text":"Restaurant was average busy for a weekday brunch, however wait time to be seated was very long. Our waitress forgot about us for awhile, did not get our order correct then overcharged us. The food was good though and maybe I just came on an off day. I do agree with M G. that unless your a regular you are pushed off to the side. The plus for me was that they offered  Flavored Creamer tubs! I may try it again if I'm in the area, otherwise I will not make a special trip."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast in AZ! The bacon and sausage are amazing, the house potatoes are great! I can't say enough good things about this place. Do yourself a favor and try it!"}
{"text":"Been here before but not again.  Wanted a lunch to fill my breakfast void this Sunday.  Place was packed and overflowing at noon!  Nice rustic look, lots of tans and yellows and tables filled with families and young couples.  The wait staff is impressively strong, carrying huge trays one handed and always appeared to be in a hurry.  Of course with that many people service will suffer some.  We were told at sign in that there would be a 20 minute wait.  It turned out to be just 10 minutes, yea!  Ah yes, they will get you after you're seated.  Five minutes then our drink orders are taken, another 15 minutes to order our food and a 25 - 30 minute starving wait to really get to eat.  I ordered Country fried steak biscuits and gravy and my wife had the New Hampton skillet consisting of country potatoes, chunked chicken, diced ham, broccoli topped with Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses plus 2 eggs.  Not a lot of cheese and a rather dry dish, as my sausage gravy topping the dish was scant, another dry old time was had!  When the check came back with my credit card, it was wrong and back it went for correction.  I was told not to get upset when I received my credit card statement and I would be refunded the erroneous charges.  Over $30 with tip for 2 \"dry\" meals, now I would not call that \" comfort food!\""}
{"text":"Sat outside which was nice since the inside was super noisy. The coffee was decent but the Eggs Benedict wasn't all that. Just seemed like it didn't have much taste was kind of bland. Even salt and pepper couldn't save the potatoes which also seemed to lack excitement. Thankfully there were 2 things that did stand out - the chicken tortilla soup and the BACON! You have to get some of their bacon it's delicious! Other than that the restaurant did not live up to my expectation maybe I should've ordered something else. Might go back maybe try something geared more towards lunch."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've ever had in Phoenix. It deserves every single high rating it receives. The staff is great. The food is simply incredible. This is a must try for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Food was great and it truly was a hidden gem.  Don't let the exterior deter you, it's really nice inside."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch.  We had been told it was 'awesome'.

Well, it wasn't.  It was good, but not 'awesome'.  Basic American food prepared simply.  It was fine.  I had the Philly sandwich, my wife had the Cordon Bleu.  Both were fine, but nothing special.

The vegetable beef soup was actually better than my sandwich, as was my wife's clam chowder.  I definitely can recommend choosing the soups as your side dish.  Or maybe just order it as your meal.  They were very good.

I wouldn't mind coming back here, but I wouldn't go out of my way either.  If you're nearby and hungry, you could do much worse than stopping here."}
{"text":"I found this spot thru yelp and it is outstanding each and every time!   I am truly attached to corn chowder soup with poblano peppers and the hot Robin sandwich!  I get it to go about 3 times a week!!  Great tasting and outstanding servers and staff!"}
{"text":"Best food ever and our Server Olivia was so sweet. She suggested there signature dessert Cinnamon Brandied Blackberry bread pudding... Heaven I tell you!!!! :)"}
{"text":"In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!

When we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!

We showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.

We looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called \"kids\" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.

As for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.

The three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!

If you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Just another breakfast place but a little more up scale and classy.

It was my first time and I walked in after a workout (after showering and putting on clean clothes) in sweats and a t-shirt and felt a lil under dressed. I sat at their \"bar\" figuring that'd be a lil easier than a table, plus I could watch Fox News and get in and out quick.

Had the Heart Scram, it was pretty good but could've used a lil more egg because the ratio of egg to veggie was heavy veggie. The fruit it came with tasted great, really fresh.

Service was okay, talked to her for my drink, order and she checked in once. Someone else brought the food out and she was nowhere to be found once I finished. I sat there a lil over five minutes hanging out (with an empty plate and glass) till the manager walked by and asked if everything was okay, said the food was great and just lookin for my check. He promptly got it and I was on my way.

I'd go there again for breakfast, like the classier atmosphere over a Denny's/IHOP. Plus the meal was only a dollar or two more expensive, with fresher ingredients."}
{"text":"Trying to be healthy, I ordered the Fruit & Yogurt Parfait...it was tasty (and maybe better as a dessert) and not as filling as the Chorizo Burrito which is my personal favorite.

P.S. the wait for 2 people is never very long"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and best customer service I've had in forever, Luana was very attentive at all times and her hard work seemed to reflect through the entire restaurant. Our first visit here will definitely not be our last."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places must visit. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it's so filling. Totally worth it. They don't serve beer/wine though."}
{"text":"Solid choice for breakfast.  Wasn't outstanding, but definitely better than average."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  Good pancakes and good egg dishes.  No real complaints...would return"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday at yelp's recommendation and was pleased with the food, but my overall experience wasn't great. The douche who took my order told me ten minutes and when I arrived exactly ten minutes later, he says, \"That was fast!  I just put your order in right now!\"  I was thinking this food better be damn good you knucklehead... 
I ordered the 222 Breakfast with 2 Pancakes, 2 Sausage and 2 Eggs.  The eggs were perfectly fluffy and seasoned to perfection and traveled well for a pick up order.  The breakfast sausage was really good and I am very picky about good breakfast sausage.  It was fresh and cooked very well.  I ordered a side order and demolished them also.  The pancakes were thick and fluffy, very very good pancakes!

My wife ordered the cinnamon french toast and while she just thought it was good, I thought they were the best I'd ever had!  I almost had to pull the car over in the middle of traffic on my way home to take a bite.  The smell was intoxicating and literally almost drove me insane on my short drive home.

Overall very good food, but the guy who took my order was not with it.  The only redeeming quality of the customer service was the nice young lady who handed me my food with a smile.

Oh and did anyone mention it's behind the Home Depot? hahah

PS - No wait on Sunday at 9am, got right in.  Plenty of seats, but it was starting to fill up at about 9:30am"}
{"text":"Super sad...I was waiting for 7 minutes to place a to go order - the hostess said she needed to find someone who could take my order - when the person finally showed up he helped the person behind me who had just walked in for a pick up.

Food is good, portions little too big but ok for sharing - too bad manners not so hot at take out stand.

The mexican place next door - Salsa Cabana - has great breakfast burritos!   Try them!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to go here for breakfast on a recent trip to Mesa. I had the all meat egg white omelet. Everything was done perfectly with great flavor. The staff was very friendly and polite. This place is a hidden gem if youre not looking for it you will never see it. Its well worth looking for. Awesomeness"}
{"text":"Whew!!!!! I finally found a great place for breakfast, so many breakfast choices....They Have Country Potatoes!!! I  just ordered the traditional breakfast today and I really enjoyed the meal, I have already chose what will be my next adventure.  

The restaurant employees are friendly and accommodating and the decor  is really nice, this is a good place for family  dining.  I recommend this establishment highly.

I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning.  Waitress was nice.  Food is overpriced.  It was incredibly warm where I was sitting.  I walked outside (into 90 degree weather at 9 am) and it felt no different.  Turn on the AC please.  Also took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"First off the food and service has been amazing every time I dine there. Secondly, it was my sons 18th birthday and of course we had said happy birthday a couple time to him and without notifying the waitress they brought out a little cake for him. It made our day to see a restaurant that pay attention and cares. Lots of respect for that place."}
{"text":"Looking for a great place for breakfast or brunch? This place is for you. It offers great food and service. I have been eating here regularly for the past year. I used to order the Vatican and bring half home. It's this delicious skillet with potatoes, sausage, bacon, cheese, peppers, topped with eggs (hold the mushrooms, please!). It comes with a side of yummy pancakes, too. Now I split it with my husband as there's enough for two. We typically go on Saturdays and have never had to wait long to get a table. The service is typically prompt, but there are a few that are especially fantastic. The outdoor patio is really nice. I am sure that I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I really love the breakfast skillets! There are a bunch of great things on the menu, I just wish they sold alcoholic breakfast drinks... Also, I think most of the staff are pretty weird. If you come around 1:00pm don't expect much service and professionalism. The staff just walk around waiting for you to leave and chat amongst themselves. It's actually kind of funny."}
{"text":"I heard from a neighbor that this place in Mesa was great. I was excited to finally go there for breakfast last Sunday.
Its a small place. Decor is country cottage style.
The hostess that sat us was very rude and unprofessional. She didnt seem like she wanted to be there. 
We were sat in the middle of the restaurant and had a very nervous but friendly waitress. She quickly got us our drinks.
It was a bit dark inside and hard to read our menus.
I cant eat eggs due to a bad gallbladder and nearly everything on the menu was egg dishes. The things that didnt have eggs, like freshtoast etc didnt come with anything else. So i ordered fresh toast and then had to order other items to go with it ala carte. The fresh toast was undercooked and the maple syrup was horrible. I ordered a small bowl of fruit and very chewy sausage.
My husband ordered a spanish type egg breakfast.  He said it was good but made very American style and a very small portion for the price.
We waited 45 min for our meal. No apologies from the waitress for the wait. 
They were way over staffed for the size of the restaurant. Waitstaff was just standing around. We counted 3 bus people, 1 hostess, 1 cashier and about 11 waitstaff. They must have had only 1 cook though since we waited so long for our food.
Our check was over $30.00!!! What? Not even worth it. 
Once we went up front to pay our bill the hostess rudely said, \"Who was your waitress?\" We said we didnt know her name. The hostess actually glared at us and walked off to the back and had to get the waitresses name to check us out. She finally came back and gave our ticket to the cashier so we could be checked out. The cashier didnt ask how our meal was, she didnt say thank you. She just gave us are receipt and walked off. The only positive thing we experienced was a very friendly waitress. That was it. 
Maybe the Tempe location is better. But do not go to this Mesa location. Crappy food, crappy menu, crappy portions, crappy prices, and crappy attitudes.
I wouldnt give any star, but i have to give atleast 1 star to post this."}
{"text":"Found this place when I yelped brunch places around the area I was driving in. We were driving around looking at furniture places. The reviews were good so my husband, daughter, mother-in-law, nephew, and I decided to try it out. 

The restaurant is a cute little place that is hidden in what appears to be a sort of industrial area. We felt like we struck gold. I ordered the daybreak which consisted of cinnamon French toast, eggs, and bacon. DELISH!! Everyone else said they really enjoyed their food as well. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. He even offered my 4 year old nephew a cookie as we left. 

I would definitely make the trip out to the area again for some yummy food!"}
{"text":"Love breakfast at this place! Great menu, and everything prepared nicely . Lots of tastebud temptations to choose from. Fun atmosphere and decor. Good service. They could add one or two more waitstaff so it would be possible for servers to more frequently check the table at a less rushed pace. But, both times we've eaten here, they were attentive. Location is surprisingly off the beaten path. But it is well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Nice establishment. It's kind of what I'd imagine a cafe to be like in a smaller town. Homey feeling with friendly service. Service was actually outstanding. The food was good, coffee pretty good as well. They have a seasonal menu with pumpkin in the fall, etc..."}
{"text":"I wish they would build a place in Houston, Texas. This is my favorite breakfast and will visit every time while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Bring Back the Chicken Enchilada Omelet!!  ...and I've never even had it. LOL. It looks simply amazing and to hear the waiter talk about it makes me salivate. It used to be on their menu but now it's a once to twice a year special. (How do I get on the \"text list\" that alerts me to its presence). 

Ok, so that being said this is a SOLID breakfast menu. Several Benedict's to choose from, a \"dap\" worthy griddle menu, skillets to fill you, and actually pretty decent coffee. (And I am a self admittedly persnickety coffee person)  Oh, and the gravy.... Fantastic. Add an order of one biscuit and gravy to whatever you get!!!!! 

This is a pleasant atmosphere food destination that is a little off the beaten path, at least the traditional restaurant location path. 

Seek it out and enjoy. AND HEY, if they have the Chicken Enchilada Omelet on the menu Let Me Know....Please 

Why 4 stars. Hmm, I find myself asking this same question. The food is good, the service pleasant and on point, the atmosphere warm.... I suppose that at this point in my Yelp \"career\" () I want to reserve my five star for the \"Holy Cow, you need to plan a trip, come by boat, come by plane, even hike, but get here\" places."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to drive 35 minutes for brunch, or even to Tempe at all, but this place was well worth it. BEST french toast I've ever had. My friends also got the biscuits and gravy, crepes and eggs. The benedict sauce wasn't my favorite. Our server was nice, ditzy but nice, but the food came out fast and everything was amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here.  Service was very good.  Food was excellent!   Decor was quirky and cute."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on the recommendation of a friend.  We were greeted promptly and brought water quickly.  I ordered the traditional breakfast, my friend ordered eggs benedict.  She said her benedict was delicious.  I found the traditional breakfast to be fairly average.  Bacon was good.  Scrambled eggs and potatoes were bland and needed a fair amount of salt.  I had subbed a biscuit instead of toast and the biscuit was pretty decent.  Overall service was pretty good, food not bad.  I would probably come here again if I was in the area but would prefer to try the lunch menu next time.  When we left there was a huge crowd outside of people waiting to get in so it's clearly a pretty popular place.  We had no wait when we arrived shortly after 10:00 on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and most of the time there is no waiting.  
I have the usual for me, the Belgian waffle.  Umm umm good! !!"}
{"text":"Came to this location. For a baby shower get together.  The waiter was friendly and prompt. He took our orders ans was correct on who went where. The food came out perfect. The waiter did not automatically add an 18% gratuity like a lot of other places do. This is a good thing for me. I do not like the auto add. I like to tip based service. All in all very good breakfast."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the California Eggs Benedict.

Food excellent
Atmosphere excellent
Service - Warren gave excellent service.
Price Total bill for one including coke: $13.75 plus tax

Management stopped by to see how everything was. I think this is excellent customer service. She was great.

Clean - yes
Menu - large variety"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. Waited forever for our food which was then delivered cold. It took another 15 minutes just to tell them because the constantly absent waitress didn't come back to check and see how the food was. We were at this restaurant for well over an hour and left frustrated and hungry. Too many great places to eat in the valley to waste time coming here."}
{"text":"Just moved in the area and am
Becoming a huge foodie hoodie!! I had the southwest chorizo carnitas skillet...can u say yummmers!! Fresh green and salsas!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came in on a Thursday morning. Not too busy, staff perfectly friendly, place was very clean. I ordered the Lobster Omelette. Slightly strong lobster taste and a lot of sauce. Slightly too much for my taste but overall it was good. Wife had Hawaiian Benedict. She at it all with no complaints and a smile. Our little one had French fries which was a bigger serving than we thought, but she overly enjoyed smearing the side of ranch on her face. 

Kinda odd seeing a lot of chairs lined and stacked on the walls (40+). Maybe for when it gets busy, but just kinda odd yo me to see them out in the open.

Overall we enjoyed it and will try another time. Only off request: square or triangle crayons. Lol so they dont roll all over the place"}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff!! Had the California eggs Benedict and it was super fresh and made perfect..

Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Egg Nog French Toast it was okay. The coffee was good and the portion size of the meal was just right. The restaurant had a comfortable feel and the staff was friendly. There was a funny odor that I caught a whiff of occasionally I think it was coming from the bathroom. I think the restaurant in Mesa is better."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. I've been here a few times now and it's very consistent. Fast, good, and friendly."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for breakfast. Arrived at 1030 Sunday morning, their busiest time. Lots of people waiting. I brought my own cup and asked the hostess if I could get a coffee while I waited. She very cheerfully took my cup to the kitchen and filled it. Spent the 25 minute wait bantering with the hostesses who were all very polite and friendly. Seated in a high traffic area, I spotted a table in the back that had just opened up, and asked if we could move. This request was met with a smile and a \"Go for it!\". Checking out what others were eating, the food looked amazing. I settled on the pulled pork and chorizo skillet, and substituted the tortilla for two very tasty pancakes for only two dollars more. My girl got the ham steak and scrambled eggs, and substituted her toast for an awesome biscuit and gravy for only two dollars. They also substitute fruit for only one dollar! The waiter was friendly and polite, took our order immediately and kept our drinks full. The wait for the food was reasonable, and our order arrived correct, hot and delicious. I am almost always disappointed in some way by a new restaurant, but this place has the total package; excellent food, friendly staff, nice decor and awesome service."}
{"text":"This is good quality breakfast food.  They have an extensive menu with something for virtually everyone.  They also serve lunch, although I have not ordered off the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I've been going here many years.

The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.

I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Best burger in the East Valley! Server (Byron) was one of the best servers I've experienced anywhere.  Food was delicious and well prepared."}
{"text":"We used to be regular costumers here but we won't come back after today. We had to wait for an hour and half and never got our food. We waited 40 minutes outside (which is not rare) and then we waited 45 more minutes to get our food. When we asked the waitress if it would take much longer she said there were 7 people in front of us in line. We asked to see the manager who took a while to come out so we ended up leaving. The waitress even charged us for the orange juice we had! I am all for paying what you order but I would expect an apology and  that's eat. I will make sure my acquaintances know about this horrible service and we will never come back."}
{"text":"I got a skillet and it was great. I substituted more veggies instead of the potatoes, but it was still flavorful. The service was also good. She was attentive and made small talk with me and my friends. Overall, I enjoyed it. I actually tried my brother's crepes and it was really good as well!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a good breakfast. The potatoes are amazing! There is a variety for everyone from skillets to crepes, to eggs and French toast."}
{"text":"Damn good steak bennedict. The steaks are well tenderizes flat iron cut grilled medium rare. The beef juices mingled with the muffins and made them so tasty I broke my atkins diet streak. Exellent saysage links also."}
{"text":"This Crackers & Co is the best and one of my favorite restaurants of all time! The California Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast item on the menu--absolutely delightful! I've been to other breakfast restaurants have come across many Eggs Benedicts that have yolks that are  overcooked, or eggs that are undercooked. This Crackers & Co does it perfectly. Additionally, the hollandaise sauce is the best I've ever had and makes a perfect Benedict. The fried potatoes that it comes with are tasty as well. The staff is super friendly, always helpful, and I truly enjoy seeing them. Also, I recently tried their Euro Crepes and they are delicious. This is definitely my #1 breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Well, the food was cold, the gravy wasn't cooked enough so it still had that uncooked flour taste, and the eggs were under cooked. Eggs are not that difficult to cook correctly but this seems to be a problem at a lot of breakfast spots. I gave it two stars because the water was good."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and loved it. Had a wonderful sandwich and everyone in our group loved everything they got. But to be honest the dessert we had, still to this day, pleasantly haunts my dreams. We ordered the GIANT layered chocolate cake and the cake was SO moist, I couldn't believe it. But the frosting blew my mind, and I'm fat mind you, so I have high standards. The frosting was like fudge from Disney World or Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory. It was totally unbelievable. I occasionally have to ask my wife if that was a real experience cause it was amazing and sometimes I think it had to have been only a dream, but it was real. Love this place."}
{"text":"0800 am last Wednesday, party of five. The waitress was less than thrilled having to serve us. Did not check back if the food was okay nor if we needed more coffee. Grumpy ! I don't care how good the food is, if your staff is not up to par it takes away from the entire experience. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Great spot for the southern bell! True home cooking with a hillbilly accent! Love all the hospitality I received, it's like cracker barrel on steroids! Yall go now and get you some,Ya hear!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite breakfast place since moving to Arizona in 2011. My parents also enjoy it and we always stop by when they come in from out of town. I always loved the California Eggs Benedict and most of the omelettes. I also enjoy the fruit parfaits and the muffins. Their breakfast potatoes are to die, too!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and after a night of catching up with old friends and staying up way too late, we ventured over to Crackers.  We were seated fairly quickly and the service was prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is cafeteria-like with outdated decor.  However, the menu has all of the regular breakfast offerings and then some.

I went with the Farmer's skillet and it was great.  My only complaint is that the potatoes were not crispy enough for my liking, but all in all, the flavors were good and it hit the spot.  Next time,  I think I will go with the Vatican, which got good reviews from one dining companion.  The only real negative was that the tortilla that came with the huevos rancheros was a little hard.  All in all, this is a good breakfast stop for the basics in a secluded strip mall behind the Home Depot."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! My boyfriend and I were extremely satisfied with the service as well as the food. I got the Breakfast Sandwich, the croissant was buttery and flakey, the bacon was crisp and the egg was nice and fluffy. It came with a side of fresh fruit, it was a nice assortment of fruits. He got the Southwest Carnitas Skillet, which was delicious! The carnitas were so flavorful and tender. We also ordered the Butterfinger French Toast  to share, and those were great. The Butterfinger flavor was not overwhelming, it was the perfect combo. Our server was friendly and patient, as we can in around 2 pm, when the place closes at 2:30. Overall, the experience was great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The crab cake Benedict was amazing and the price for everything was very reasonable!  I'll be going be here in the near future."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for breakfast, no contest.  Everything is amazing.  I got the Meat Lover's Omelet over and over because it was so good and didn't want to risk anything else not being as awesome, but recently was brave and tried their biscuits and gravy and it was amazing too.  My wife loves the pancakes.  We always leave having ate too much and its not health food (at least the items we order) but have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I was too busy to leave the office one day so I had my co-workers grab me a sandwich, any sandwich.  What I received was a delicious steak sandwich that was like no other I had ever tried.  Pretty much the best sandwich I've ever had - juicy strips of steak, grilled onions and peppers topped with fine cheese.  So yum.  I've been back three times to get this sandwich and it was never as good as it was that first time.  The last one was total crap actually.  So thirty dollars later, I gave up on this place and my quest for that perfect steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl of their good chili, with crackers. Server explained they were out of crackers, no pun intended. As a substitute, I asked for a slice of bread, assuming it would be considered a substitute for the crackers. Received one slice of white toast, plain. Was billed $1.89 extra for the toast. Complained about being penalized because they had no crackers, and charge was removed from bill. Won't return, because I never trust people who cheat their customers."}
{"text":"I love going here, I have only been for breakfast.  Sitting on the patio is very nice, service is great considering how busy they are.  The french toast is amazing, one order can easily be split between two people.  Sunday's seem to be busy but I have not had to wait more than 15 min. and they don't rush you when you are seated."}
{"text":"Enjoy this breakfast spot. Staff is always nice and the gluten free items I order are good"}
{"text":"The California eggs Benedict is outstanding but we've honestly never had anything but great food from here. You can't go wrong with a skillet or the soup and sandwich lunch. It's usually very busy and  seems like a few more staff would be helpful, but the food is so good that we just wait it out and order as soon as our server comes."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had! The food came super quick, the service was great and the meal was amazing! I ordered the spicy Baja omelet and was soooo happy! The potatoes are unreal!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Tempe! The pancakes are my all time favorite and they literally melt in your mouth with the special honey butter on it! Definitely recommend this place if you're in Tempe!!"}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday morning and the place was PACKED.  We didn't need to wait to long though (went over to the guitar store for a bit).  We were seated pretty promptly and ordered eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy.  The food was really tasty and the service was quick!  I would definitely come back here for the great breakfast and nice service."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place near the South Mountain Pima Canyon Access.

We came here on Sunday around 8:30am after hiking nearby, and I enjoyed my breakfast here.

I noticed there are a lot of chairs outside the restaurant, although they weren't busy at all when we arrived, I bet they get really busy later on the day.  In fact when we left the restaurant around 9:30am they were about 80% full.

I had Southwest Egg Benedict. Spicy chorizo patty went well with avocado. It was just a bit spicy but it wasn't overwhelming at all. It was just right and tasted good. Poached egg was cooked perfectly. When I cut it half I was really happy to see slightly runny yolk. Adobo Hollandaise sauce tasted good too. While I really enjoy traditional Hollandaise sauce, this southwestern flavored complimented the egg benedict pretty well.

Coffee was blah... just what I anticipated. I would skip coffee next time, and will get a cup of coffee afterwords somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast stop with family. Their menu is large and has something for everyone. In an effort to be heathy I went with the healthy scram that was packed with everything. It was as tasty as a heathy meal could be. I would have rather scarfed down my brothers chicken fried steak, not because mine was bad but because his looked so good. Go places to visit."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! This place has yummy breakfast. Its the first place in Arizona where I found good Eggs Benedict. Its a nice and quiet place for a late brunch. My husband had the country fried steak and eggs that he loved. The potatoes that come with your meal were excellent. I'll be going back. The reasoning for the 4 stars is that we sat and waited for along time for our drink order to be taken. The waitress the whole time was behind the bar counter talking to another waiter about some girl problem he was having. See thats how quiet it is in there I heard their whole conversation."}
{"text":"a very pleasant surprise.... i wasn't expecting much because... well, the name, and the fact that when we walked in on a saturday morning, it wasn't busy and it was filled with a bunch of old people. 

but the breakfast menu lured me in.... and then the Co totally delivered! i got the california benny and it was.... so good. They do not skimp on the avo or the bacon! i was wildly impressed. i actually had so much avo and bacon, i didn't have enough egg and muffin to eat it with!

husband ordered the southwest carnitas skillet...  man! this thing was huge and hearty! and really quality carnitas too! a very pleasant surprise. i may have stolen a few bites.

the service was cheerful, and our water cups runneth over with refills. we were pleasantly surprised and have a new breakfast go-to spot!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and it is usually fine but this time the office (six of us) ordered soup and half sandwiches.  The soup came fine but for some reason we waited 40 minutes for the damn half sandwiches.  I spoke with our waitress.  Did not get her name. Only way i can describe her here is.. Heavy set girl.  She knows folks (two tables I counted) came in behind us and were served before us and she was putting in tickets.  She said she would check but continued with the tickets.  Management, we only have a set amount of time for lunch.  Something needs to be done or we won't be back.  Terrible waitress who seemed to not care."}
{"text":"Service was great by Kim. I ordered the Steak Avocado sandwich from the lunch menu and it was perfect. The bread was soft, and the medium cooked steak was tender."}
{"text":"Great customer service.
Restaurant was clean and service was quick even with the lunch crowd coming in.
The Eggs Benedict were delish.
The husband approves of the Huevos Rancheros Benedict.
My son got the Euro Crepe which had bananas and Nutella and he liked it very much.
Our little one just nibbled off of all our food and loved them all."}
{"text":"Came because of the glowing posts; won't return as my experience was mehh...
Nothing outstanding here. Omelets are okay, good seasoned home fries breakfast potatoes, service a bit spotty and the atmosphere had the warmth of a cafeteria. Tables close together, stone on the walls so sound levels are up. Difficult to hold a conversation and equally difficult not to overhear the conversations of the six tables around."}
{"text":"My husband and I took a friend here for breakfast over the holidays. They have an array of selections to fit everyone's palate. I am not an egg eater, nor a sweet eater (such as pancakes/waffles). I was happy to see many meat selections on their menu. Portions are big. Depending on appetite entrees could be shared. We had a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't understand the really high reviews for just an okay place.  It was really dark inside and I had to use my flashlight to see the menu.  Not one employee seemed happy to be there, no one smiled much less greeted us.  My waitress simply took my order.  She did refill my drink.  I had to ask for a spoon so I could eat my soup.  I had to steal salt and pepper from another table.  And for the price spent I would have expected a better meal.  It was my 9 year old daughter who said we would not return."}
{"text":"Tasty food! Great atmosphere to eat! 

Their oatmeal with blueberries is an excellent choice for breakfast . It is a great choice as we get to make it ourselves, put the milk in, blueberries, sugar, it is just so calming and like a tradition for us when we get their oatmeal. My friend/co-worker and I always grab this for breakfast. The bread pudding is amazing as well. Their fries are just delicious. They always have a bit of a crowd during the morning and lunch hours and obviously Cracker is doing something good here.

This is definitely one of our spots. You just cannot go wrong eating here. The menu is tasty, whether breakfast or lunch. I could eat everything! Go here!"}
{"text":"Really good! Staff is nice and eager to please. Food was delicious and fresh! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I always love this place for breakfast and brunch. Their omelettes are tasty and theirnbiscuits and gravy rock. Love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast for the first time, and most likely will never come back. I ordered contry garden omlete, and my boyfriend had crab cake egg benedict. Crab cake was deep fried and very oily. Both plates came with potatoes, and those potatoes were awful. So we ate only the eggs. Overall the food is mediocre. It's edible but we didn't enjoy it. 
The water that they brought us was tap water that wasn't even filtered.
Also they had radio on that was playing only commercials, and only one song playing may be every 10 minutes. Who would want to hear commercials instead of music at a restaurant? When I go out to eat I like to enjoy nice atmosphere and food. This place didn't have neither."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!!! Scrambled eggs and bacon done nicely and the French toast is killer!!! The only thing that sucks is the very long wait time to get seated on weekends!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast and were super impressed with the food! The portions were generous and our waiter was super nice and attentive. Coffee was delicious and prices were fair. It was a little hard to find but well worth looking for. We definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been to Crackers & Co. several times and the food has been consistently good. Unfortunately the service not so. 
The skillets, pancakes and French toast where all tasty.  
Service, like I said can be good, ok or \"what the hell is going on?!\" 

Last time I had my waiters switched and the first one keep taking stuff from our table (silverware, syrup etc) to give to other tables! Then the second one would get pissed. Both of them had an 'I rather be somewhere else\" attitude

So, the food is 4 stars, the service anywhere from 2 to 4."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that they do not have a gluten free menu.  The waitress did ask the chef though.  I ordered the Farmer's Skillet.  It had teeny tiny little bits of what must have been the ham as listed on the menu.  Couldn't quite tell.   Pretty sure the potatoes are those freeze dried disks like you get in a box of potato au gratin. Eggs were not cooked right.  Had to send it back.

Environment is nice.  Service was friendly and professional. 

Coffee was watery.  One thing I liked was they left the carafe on the table.

My sister picked at her biscuits and gravy.  She's too polite to say anything, but I could tell she didn't like it."}
{"text":"Found this place because I was in the area from outof town needing breakfast and I pulled up yelp and there it was! I am definitely not disappointed!  Service was friendly and food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Huevos ranchero with carne.  BOMB!!! 
Fast service despite being busy
Hubby eggs over done. But everything else was perfect!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, the food is always great and the pancakes are huge! Love a place who gives large portions! And their breakfast potatoes are really good, not those overly greasy shredded garbage!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there in the past. But I had a HORRIBLE experience last time. I ordered 2 strips of bacon extra crispy it came out rubbery. I like my bacon to snap. Waited and waited finally got my server to take it back & said I ordered it extra crispy, well done....I WISH I HAD taken a Photo, to my HORROR they brought 6 strips of  BLACK CHARRED TOTALLY BURNT bacon. It smelled so Disgusting that ppl around smelled it looking over in shock. The server said, \"Some of those pieces with black char is only because the bacon stuck together. WHAT ???
It was ALL CHARRED BURNT BLACK like they shoveled it out of a fireplace. The service was horrible but the kitchen should NEVER have allowed that BURNT bacon to come to a customer.  No manager to be found, server didn't apologize just made an excuse. THIS IS INEXCUSABLE. Ppl eat there cuz they get Big portions. GO TO DENNY'S."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot! We've been to all of the other independent places around, and Crackers and Co seems to be the most consistent. The coffee is amazing!!! I highly recommend the California Eggs Benedict and my husband loves the Beggers omelets."}
{"text":"I came here with my family. I was starving. They didn't have any room for us so we sat on the patio. It seemed like we got less attention because we weren't inside but it was a nice morning. I got the southwest skillet and I thought I would eat it all but after I finished half I was very full. It was delicious. They were out of orange juice, which sucked because that's what I was looking forward to the most, but they were pretty busy. I'd go there again, but maybe on a slower morning."}
{"text":"The service has always been outstanding and the food is always delicious! I will always recommend crackers and company to fellow pwers"}
{"text":"They have the best food ever. No lie....I love this place. Amazing breakfast and brunch. Awesome Fajita in a Pita, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, and Chicken Tortilla Soup! You will not be unsatisfied with anything hear."}
{"text":"I have been to this place maybe half a dozen times now and have had a good experience every time. It might be a dollar or two more than some of the other breakfast places but the quality, atmosphere, and service has always been excellent. They have breakfast items and lunch items. One of my favorites has been the crepe breakfast that includes two eggs two bacon Crepes and you can add in fruit for under a dollar. It is absolutely delicious. Since there aren't a lot of places that sell crepes I often end up getting them here and have not been sorry."}
{"text":"My daughter called me out of the blue and said she had a couple hours before she had to pick up the kids from childcare and did I want to go out to lunch and then go to the park with them afterwards. I dropped everything and started getting ready but I was about a half hour drive away. She arrived way before me and started looking over the menu. I had been to the other location at 87 and 60 so I was somewhat familiar with the food. I remembered having a breakfast that included bacon eggs and Crepes that I had really liked at the other place so I told her to track that down on the menu and order for me to save time. She decided that sounded good so she got the same thing. She got her crepes with strawberries and I got mine with blueberries. The food was delivered to the table just as I was walking through the front door so that was perfect timing. The breakfast was every bit as good as I remembered from the other place. We both enjoyed it. The waitress was cheerful and friendly and provided the perfect amount of service, not too much not too little. I wasn't even aware crackers and Company had other locations besides the one I had been to near Arizona Avenue so I was please to be able to try out this location. If I'm in the area again I would definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Not on the main street and tucked in a business park but great food and quantity for the price.  French toast is the bomb.  Chicken fried steak biscuits and gravy was yummy too."}
{"text":"Very nice, went early with friends.  Limited options for gluten free... as in eggs, turkey bacon, and fruit but my friends without limitations had lots of options.

It's about 20 min drive but again was meeting with friends.

Peak hours will be long lines!  The food is worth it.  Parking is tricky."}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times.  It is usually on weekends and I am used to them being busy.  I have never had a bad meal here and usually order off the specials menu.  Today I had the Avocado Cheddar BLT.  The portion of bacon was substantial and it was nicely complimented with the other ingrediants.  The chipotle mayo had a nice zing to it.  I finally had their chile as a side and it was also very good.  I've never had any issue with the host station or any service person.  They were all very nice.  The decor is nice and the pricing for their food is fair.  I just love the not so good reviews on here when people complain about non related issues to the restaurant.  I think this is a great choice for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Run of the mill breakfast joint that Mesa'ns seem to enjoy. I came in for breakfast with my dad while visiting and it was still rather busy with an older crowd on Friday morning. As a vegetarian there aren't a ton of options, something I've sadly become accustom to in AZ. I had some eggs with potatoes and toast. My dad enjoyed the disgustingly fatty egg scramble with tons of meat covered in hollandaise. Whatever makes you happy I guess. The food was good, service was a bit too friendly and obtrusive. I would be cool to see some dishes that think outside the standard breakfast box but I don't mind coming here over a diner/corporate place."}
{"text":"I have always had great food each time I've been here, and today was no exception. Service was fast and friendly and the food was awesome. Normally we have to wait to be seated but today we were immediately seated."}
{"text":"Wow. I have never been blown away by breakfast as I was here. Never.

Simple. Hearty. Filling. Good price. What more can I ask for?

I ordered (can't remember the name...my bad) a croissant with eggs, cheese and bacon in it which came with a side of fresh fruit. I was greeeeedy heffa and ordered a side of their homestyle potatoes/fries. OMG they were so good and a little different from what I've normally been served...they were buttery, creamy and tasted of dill or a different type of season one doesn't usually experience. The potatoes were soft and crunch at the SAME TIME~ I know, I'm so easy to please...but it was so worth it.

Hubby ordered the Three Musketeers and he was suitably impressed as well...he cleared everything off on his plate and looked so happy. After an early start of hitting the mall (to get his computer fixed) and then me dragging him around Home Depot (lights needed to be replaced), this was such a lovely way to get in a late breakfast at 11am.

I'll definitely be back to try their other items on the menu - it all looks so wonderful."}
{"text":"This probably our favorite breakfast place. Today, we purposely set our appointment for auto service in the early morning so we could be here for breakfast (drove in from Litchfield Park). People are friendly, food is terrific, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Used previous yelp reviews to find this place just off the 10 on drive back to Tucson from Phoenix. We wanted some brunch stuff to go. 
This place is great!!! Great food with wonderful customer service. Tuna melt, a BLT with added roasted turkey on top, and the crepes were all nice and flavorful. Good quantity. 
More people should know about this place. Looking forward to stopping in again when back in town 
Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good brunch spot in a really random area.  You'd never know a restaurant was here unless you knew about it already or found it on yelp..lol.  I like to get the garden omelette and add meat to it.  Their pancake is decent..nothing about it really sticks out.  My significant other always orders the chicken fried steak with gravy.  I've had a couple of savory bites and it is quite tasty.  We always seems to have leftover for breakfast the next day.  Service is generally pretty good although there can be a bit of a wait after 9am.  I like that they leave a pitcher of coffee and water with you so you aren't waiting for a refill."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

A couple months ago, I craved pancakes.

Although I mainly live in Scottsdale, it's only within the past few months that I've been home long enough to actually have enough time to try new places and not just places that my parents recommended or visit places where my friends work at or own. 

Now I see how fortunate I was to grow up having parents that value great food and great eating experiences. Mostly, because, no matter where we were, even when we traveled, they did all the research to find extremely great places to eat. Research used to mean referring to bulky travel guides and book versions of Zagats for each city. Now research is pulling out an iPhone, jumping on the Internet, and opening up Yelp.

After I exhausted all the pancake places I knew, (IHOP, Wildflower Bread Company, Market Café at The Buttes, Morning Squeeze, Snooze AM, Butters and The Good Egg), using Yelp, I found incredible places (and increased from pancakes to crêpes) like the Crêpe Bar, T.G Eggington's, and Iss' Magic Mixes Oatmeal Café. I also found a couple places I didn't like so much. And today I found Crackers & Co.

CRACKERS & CO.

Crackers & Co. opened their first location in 1984. 
Their website says that their menu was founded on the European heritage of the owner and has a warm, rural Tuscan ambience.

Currently, there are three locations:
~Eastgate (Country Club & US60)
~Mountain View (Greenfield & Brown)
~Tempe (Priest & Elliot)

THE STORY 

This morning, I ate at the Tempe location.

When I walked in, I should have walked back out. Honestly, not because of anything wrong with Crackers & Co. but because it's just not a good fit for me.

The hostess was very sweet. I asked to sit at the bar and she helped me to my seat. There are two main dining areas and the place was very busy. The ambience included a lot of plastic vines and trees with vinyl table cloths, which was more like a nursing home than \"warm, rural Tuscan.\" There was a lot of activity at the bar for the take out and the radio was blaring local commercials and then Miley Cyrus. The bartender, Bill, was very nice and efficient. I ordered berry blintzes and a mimosa.

The $5 mimosa wasn't that great. It wasn't horrible either. That's when I started wondering what makes a good mimosa: Is it the fresh squeezed orange juice and quality champagne, or at least one or the other? This had neither. The orange juice was heavy and thick, cafeteria style. The champagne was hardly noticeable, but I was happy it was there. I ordered another.

The blintzes were at a disadvantage even before they came out, because I was raised by a Jewish grandmother who made THE best cheese blintzes. I asked Bartender Bill if the blueberry topping was compote. He said they purée the berries in back, so I said ok. The blintzes arrived covered in thick berry compote. Now there are positive and negative ways of looking at this. One positive way, is that they have extremely generous servings. Although I scraped it all off, I'm going to stick with that way of looking at it. After that, I ate them all and basically cleaned the plate, so that says something.

The menu was huge and there were also daily specials, which include many skillets, omelettes, pancakes, French toast, Crêpes, waffles, oatmeal, cinnamon rolls, eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy. (In fact, I saw jalapeño biscuits and gravy which sounded tasty).

CONCLUSION 

In summary, the staff was very nice, the food is good here if this is your favorite style of food, and you will be very happy here if you enjoy this type of environment.

3/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"M brought us here for Easter brunch and yow-za!  I am a BIG fan of their food now!  We were seated pretty quickly for 10:45 am on a Sunday for a party of 7.  We ordered a variety of breakfast and lunch items which were all delicious.  No one walked away hungry.  It is in a weird, tucked away location, in the industrial area near the Holiday Inn off Country Club Rd and the 60 freeway.

They are only open for breakfast and lunch.

The items eaten during our visit include the breakfast burrito with chorizo, the California eggs benny, the Oscar benny(with crab), the Sunday special scramble, the pecan honey dijon salad, and the sirloin avocado melt.  The home fried potatoes were soooo good!
The coffee was very good and they offer half and half or flavored creamers. 

The server was great.  No one went without a refilled drink and the food came out just as we ordered.  One thing my sister and I commented on is that they were not stingy with the avocado on our dishes!"}
{"text":"Dropped my car to get some repairs and was out with my 2 daughters, one of their' s fiancé and my grandson, so a party of 4  1/2 and it was early and we wanted food. I didn't really know what was around the area we were in so I went my yelp app and found Crackers & Co Café, we got directions to the place and drove past it, it didn't look like it was opened, went up the street to waffle house, but then said nope lets go back to Crackers, man are we glad we did!  My grandson, who is a year and half is a ham, he thought everyone should be paying attention to him and to get to him be quite wasn't gonna happen, so thank you everyone at Crackers for putting up with him LOL, our server was Felix, and he was good and made sure everything was always filled! I like that, don't like it when my coffee cup becomes empty LOL  My daughter ordered the French toast! WOW that's some toast!! Looked delish!! I ordered the farmers skillet, which had ham, onions mushrooms and country potatoes and eggs, with cheese!!! I got a side order of salsa and that baby was good!!! All the dishes that were ordered looked delish! My other daughter ordered the biscuits and gravy!!! That would have been my 2nd choice and the fiancé ordered huevos rancheros,  again everything looked and smelled delish!! I think next time I am going to try the eggs benny!   Lesson we learned that day, don't judge a place by its outsides,,,,haha"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. I wanted breakfast really badly and just moved to AZ so I needed to find a breakfast place. Unfortunately this place probably isn't it. I was seated right away, but my waitress never came to take my order so someone else did. I ordered the biscuits and gravy breakfast since that's my typical breakfast when I go out. My food came out rather quickly, but it was definitely lackluster. The sausage gravy looked like a McCormick sausage gravy packet, potatoes weren't entirely cooked, and the eggs were kinda dry. Plus it was all cold when it came out...it took about five minutes if that for it to get cold. The only somewhat decent part of my meal was that the biscuit was large and fluffy and my soda didn't taste like syrup (its happened before at other restaurants). I probably won't be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"I was quite proud that I starved myself three entire meals before heading here for brunch. It was a friend's birthday and I had not been to Crackers& Co in over 10 years. Being familiar with the menu, I decided earlier in the week that I would venture back memories' lane for a few of my faves.  

I started with a cup the Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup which taste exactly how I remembered it from back in the day. Still hot, still savory, still delish!
My friend and I split the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes and I could have honestly died right there right then. So good!

For my main meal I ordered the Country Fried Steak Biscuits and Gravy. The steak was very tasty and the country potatoes were griddle fried to perfection. 

I made it half way through my main meal and decided to pump the brakes and suggested we split the daily bread pudding special but the response I got was, You! Can't! Be! Serious!

So we decided to save that for another time. 

Later that night I had the other portion of my breakfast for dinner. I slept well."}
{"text":"I liked the big parking lot, decor, and space in the dining area.  We had a party of 10 and they took reservations.  Plus plus plus plus!!!  We were seated swiftly and our server came over immediately to take our drink orders.  She was back right away with our drinks.  We had to wait for some of the others in our party to show up.  After waiting 10 mins, we were noitifed that the others were not showing up.  BOO. We got the server's attention and she came over to take our order.  I ordered the meat lover omlette.  The eggs were a little too done but tasty flavor.  The potatoes were good too.  The service was excellent!!!  Never an empty cup and she bought an extra plate without us asking for the kids.  She even offered togo ice teas for us.  WHOA."}
{"text":"Great price,great service...phenomenal breakfasts and lunches. Large variety of choices."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this breakfast place! I took my family here last year when they were visiting from out of state, the service was outstanding and the food was perfect! 

Fast forward! I went here recently with my boyfriend to grab some breakfast before we headed out for a day of errands. We were seated right away and our server was at our table well within five minutes to get our drink order. She brought us out our drinks very quickly. He ordered Oj and I ordered a cup of coffee, she not only brought me a cup with creamer on the side but left a small insulated carafe of coffee for the table. Impressive! They are smart enough to know people tend to complain a lot about coffee refills :)- we ordered our breakfast plates and they brought out ketchup for the hash browns and HOT syrup for the pancakes. The bacon that came with my plate was actual bacon! Not that thin greasy microwave stuff you tend to find at chain breakfast joints. They definitely go the extra mile to make sure that everything they intend to serve you is top quality! No cut corners at this place!  I will definitely be returning the next time I'm up early enough on my day off to grab some breakfast!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for an impromptu breakfast this morning after I got off work. Immediately upon entering the cafe', I was greeted by a friendly hostess whom politely asked me for my name and explained it would be a 15-20 minute wait. My husband and I took a seat near the hostess station. It wasn't long before we were called. We were seated in the back at a nice table where we were handed menus and our waitress introduced herself to us. She was friendly and has the same name as our daughter--Rachel. She took our drink order and brought our coffee, cream, sugar with cold water right out to us quickly. 
We perused their delightful menu for both breakfast and lunch. They serve breakfast all day until they close at 2:30 pm and they serve lunch beginning at 10:30 am.
We chose Belgium waffles. I ordered only the Belgium Waffle and my husband ordered the Belgium Waffle breakfast that comes with a choice of sausage or bacon and two eggs prepared anyway.
We waited about 15 to 20 minutes for our food as it was busy. The wait was worth it! The Belgium waffles were thick and hearty. The syrup was yummy. The butter on top was really good. Everything was delicious and melt in your mouth goodness.
We definitely will return in the near future."}
{"text":"We love this place. There is rarely a wait, even on Saturday at breakfast/brunch hour and their service is fast even for large parties. Their servers always seem to be well spoken and fast! Their breakfast dishes are delicious and I love that they've always been accommodating with substitutions. My husband loves the French toast and I love the blintzes with fresh fruit. It's a comfortable environment for our toddler. This is our go-to breakfast joint!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better breakfast places I've tried in the East Valley.  They are always friendly & consistent. They have quick table turnover so you never really have to wait longer than 20 mins for a table,  even on a busy Sunday morning.  Most of the time,  we get seated right away.  I love their Benedicts, whether from the menu or one of their rotating options. The crabcake rendition from the menu is very tasty.  The crabcake is mostly crab with very little filler. Can't go wrong with that.  Their country fried steak on a biscuit is seriously perfect. You get a cross between the country fried steak breakfast and biscuits and gravy,  all in one!  Yummy potatoes too, little bit of crisp from the flattop!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but the waiter was a little off. He took our drink order and came back and had no idea who ordered what drink and didn't wen have all the beverages for our table.  That being said he was apologetic and the rest of the experience was almost perfect. Someone ordered an fried egg which he never brought but didn't bathe us for either so I'm not sure if he didn't write it down or what happened there
I ordered the southwest chorizo carnitas skillet. It was so delicious. Someone else got the French toast it looked pretty good too. The portions were very generous and the price was perfect. I would definitely recommend crackers and co and eat here often."}
{"text":"Crackers is a good, solid offering in the restaurant field close to where I live. Their menu has a great variety of items, and it's a very popular place. If you go, you can be pretty sure you will find an item that appeals to you. 

The reason I only give them three stars is due to sloppy preparation. On my last visit, I ordered the apple spinach salad. The chicken on top was burned on part of the portion, and the rest was as dry as shoe leather. This would have been a pretty good salad if not for that careless oversight by the kitchen and waitstaff. On my visit one month ago, my son's quesadilla came out burned. We sent that item back to be remade. It's always a major pain when one person in your group can't eat with everyone else.

Crackers is a busy place, which means the servers aren't always very attentive. I can forgive this, as you know your server is running around like crazy trying to help everyone. The bottom line is that I think management needs to prevent the kitchen from sending out burned, overcooked items, and maybe hire more servers so they can pay more attention to the tables they have."}
{"text":"Whoa Whoa Whoa!
How Have I NOT written a review to crackers yet?!
Crackers and Co. is my absolute favorite breakfast place by far.  I rant and rave about how i always want to go because...I LOVE Breakfast!  Their country potatoes are to die for when you get them served fresh. Now i am not saying they have came out gross before i just do not like eating potatoes or french fries after i have left a restaurant they just aren't the same. I cant believe someone thinks their food is bland. they must have made a wrong choice somewhere.  Everything i have gotten has been amazing to say the least.  For some reason i always get the skillets and go back and forth with which one i will get.  But the most recent time i went i got their super amazing french toast that melts in your mouth like cinnabon but not as sweet where you feel as if you will die in the next hour. No the French toast is perfect but next time i will only get one slice not 6. Their biscuits and gravy are pretty damn good too. the sauce isn't watery or soupy but just amazing.  My sister has tried one of the omelletes i just cannot remember which one. i will be trying one today when i finish getting ready for the day. which of course im looking forward too. make sure when you get to crackers if you enjoy lemonade order yourself the strawberry lemonade its my favorite! More than Hot dog on a sticks lemonade which i drink on a regular basis working in the chandler mall.   
Oh one more thing...If you want superb customer service every time go to this location that is behind home depot.  I have been to the Tempe location 3 times now and 2 out of 3 times the customer service was just mediocre to poor. the most recent time a friend and i went our waiter was finally nice thank god. For some reason their hostess doesn't come off pleasant what so ever and obviously doesn't care about quality customer service on weekends(which is when i went once) . But the mesa location is so far my favorite and i cant wait to stuff my face with some of crackers and cos amazing food! :)"}
{"text":"I personally love the other crackers so much more. I think it's the better customer service I'm never really impressed with the services here. It's either okay or a little below expectation something always happens when I come here. Something is forgotten or the wait is ridiculous just for the check to be picked up to be paid for or something. I can never tell you because it always changes.  Food wise...good. this last visit the French toast was NOT as amazing as it usually is. So kind of bummed about that. And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils. For food and service to be off is unusual. But it happened so i always remember if you want the best you have to go to the best and this place is not it. Go to the one in mesa behind Home depot and beside Holiday Inn!"}
{"text":"The quesadilla is to die for!  All of the different ingredients make for an amazing flavor."}
{"text":"I had the strawberry banana and granola oatmeal and it was the best oatmeal I've ever had! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good & fast no nonsense breakfast. Get there early on the weekends if you can. Tasty and not too greasy sausage links, side fruit plate was fresh and a nice mix of fresh strawberries/blueberries/grapes, and the granola pancakes were very good as well. Wifey likes her potatoes, and pretty much everything else, extra crispy, and said they did them perfectly. Accommodating staff, and kid friendly, saw a few other toddlers. We'll be back for weekend brunch again soon."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy, the service was great. I went two days in row for breakfast when I was on Vacation in Arizona."}
{"text":"Crackers always has good food. They give you the feel of a small town restaurant but they have good service and they don't disappoint. I brought one of my friends visiting from out of town here after a morning hike and she was very pleased. Definitely one of my go-to breakfast spots in the valley"}
{"text":"I always get the French toast. The best consistent in town; I've never had a bad meal....(French toast)
Will always be coming here at least once a month....hopefully.

{"text":"Always great!!! 
Order - Day Break +1 Extra Piece French Toast
           - 2 Egg Whites, 2 pieces Extra Krispy Bacon
Had Jessica today, great waitress - she read my mind on how I wanted my food separated and my order was exact!! Love this place!!!

{"text":"I'm so grateful for yelp, and Crackers & Company Cafe is a perfect example of why! This place is tucked in a place I never would have looked for food. This place is SO GOOD! I walked in, and I'm not gunna lie, I wasn't expecting much. I didn't smell much, and the appearance, while clean, isn't quite anything that makes me think to myself - \"self, this is gunna be good.\" BUT, let me tell you. I ordered the carnitas omelet. The carnitas were tender and so flavorful. It cam with a side of refried beans. I was thinking to myself . . . I'm not gunna eat much more than the omelet, so that's fine . . . . but then I tasted them. These beans are packed with so much flavor! I'm not talking about blatant spices like cumin or anything like that, I'm talking about being simmered in a seriously flavorful broth. A lot of love goes into those damn refried beans! When I mentioned how amazing they were to our server, he says to me - and I kid you not - \"we got a guy.\" Well. . . . I hope they're paying that guy well because the carnitas and beans (who even cares that it was in omelet form!) knocked my socks off! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there as an out-of-towner and really enjoyed my breakfast. I had the pork carnitas skillet and it was delicious. After being disappointed with the carnitas at an actual Mexican restaurant, I was quite impressed with that skillet. I also took the recommendation with regard to the fresh baked raisin toast, and that also held up to the recommendations listed here. I tried a bit of the bran muffin and that too was to die for. I cant think of anything negative to say about anything during our visit. We even had a little laugh at the check that says \"crakers copy\" at the bottom. I'd definitely return and recommend this place to anyone for a delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Consistently good!
Been here on many occasions and the service is great. The food is always consistently good. From the skillets, crepes, and Benedicts

His is a definite favorite of ours and a place we eat at regularly"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast! Today wasn't a good day though for my server. She messed up mine and my cousin's meals but she made up for by comping our meals as well as our black berry bread pudding appetizer I love so much. Even with this little catastrophe I will always continue to be a patron! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Cute ambiance with excellent food. Had the mushroom spinach omelet with potatoes and toast. Yummy. Husband had eggs benedict California style equally as good and the kept the coffee coming."}
{"text":"Been there for Breakfast. Too MUCH BUTTER. Went there for lunch on Friday. Arrived 10 mins after the others in my party that ordered. I ordered a traditional breakfast. Their food came out 30 mins before mine. When my breakfast came our waitress reach across the 4 top from the opposite side of my seat and handed me the hot plate. So she reached over the others seat on my left. Although my plate was HOT, my breakfast was lukewarm. The potatoes were hard and cold. The bacon was cold. The eggs were lukewarm. I complained and got another plate of potatoes that were fresh. My coworkers finished their meals and she brought the check as I midway through my meal. Then came back right away anticipating we were ready to pay. I was still eating my food. She needs some additional training! I won't be back,"}
{"text":"ate at crackers on easter sunday. asked to be seated on the patio as it was a beautiful day. there were many people waiting for an inside table but we were seated immediately. the hostess couldnt have been more pleasant. within minutes the waiter showed and asked about beverages and proceeded to get our coffees and creamers. we ordered a country garden omelet and a denver omelet. both were excellent with the toast being a nice toasted level of doneness without being hard and crusty. the scalloped potatoes were very tasty and, for me, needed no salt. all in all an excellent meal and perfect personal service with friendly personnel."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here!! My favorite is their Pecan Honey Dijon Salad. It's so fresh and delicious with tomatoes, pecans, cheese, avocado, bacon and chicken. The dressing is my absolute favorite! The bread pudding is another favorite of mine - AMAZING!! Been coming here for years and love it every time! Good customer service and a cute little place for breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get breakfast all day and then eat dessert! I love coming here with girlfriends for a long lunch but my husband likes to come here too. There's something on the menu for everyone- excellent soups and sandwiches if you want lunch but I usually end up getting breakfast. Biscuits and gravy, eggs Benedict or just regular eggs and sausage are all favorites. I love the lemon cheesecake but if you like bread pudding they have a delicious blackberry version. Beware, they close at 2:30 in the summer so come early if you plan on staying awhile."}
{"text":"After having a not particularly pleasing experience at US Egg, decided to try this place, and in fact have gone there twice during my visit in the area.

I wish they were open earlier than 7 am.  I wish the seating was more cozy... each time I ended up at a table in the middle of the dining room.  Had a skillet both times, was good, especially the potatoes.  Servers were normal, not pretentious.  

So yea, I'd go back, Only real criticism is the seating and atmosphere and the hours they open."}
{"text":"Crackers and Co. is always a treat. Like other users have mentioned the California Eggs benedict is absolutely awesome. Also like other users said, parking can sometimes be a pain. The location in South Tempe usually has less people, but as with any breakfast place if you go between 7-10 AM expect a bit of a wait. 

The employees here usually outshine the food, especially so at the Mesa location. A gentle old lady let us pore over the menu for 10 minutes before putting in our order. The food was out of the kitchen quickly (despite the full house) which is a huge positive in my book. I hate lingering around restaurants at their busiest times.

The last good thing I'll mention about Crackers & Co. is the low price of the food. Guaranteed to stop your brain from leaking out of your ears after a night of heavy drinking."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Crackers Cafe on Elliot in Tempe, and it was fantastic. I had the Dijon chicken salad and it was delicious. Lots of chicken, a beautiful splayed out avocado, tomatoes, fresh greens, and the dressing was yummy. They substituted the garlic bread for nice whole grain toast, which  I appreciated. They were very reasonably priced.The service was excellent and they brought refills of drinks without anyone asking. The salad was filling and perfect. I noticed they had an extensive breakfast menu. I will be back when I'm on this part of town."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, great patio seating area, tasty food.

I was pretty impressed with my first experience with Crackers & Co Cafe. When I showed up, it was overflowing with people--granted, it was a Sunday morning, right in the middle of the brunch rush. Fortunately, I had people waiting on me, and we had a table right out on the patio ready to go. It was a beautiful day (in the neighborhood), and it couldn't have been better to sit out on the patio for brunch.

The service was superb. Our server was very attentive and very friendly. With a big party, we had lots of requests, and he was always on top of them (or quickly making up for having missed a thing or two). Our food came out quickly--surprisingly so, in fact--even with the big group, and it was all correct.

As for the food itself, I had the garden omelette. This was by far the best garden omelette I've had. The eggs were the right consistency, and the veggies were plentiful and fresh. I cut the omelette into thirds and put them into the tortillas they provided, along with some Cholula, and I loved it! The potatoes were a nice side dish as well.

My nephew shared his carrot cake muffin with me, and that thing was pretty darn tasty as well. I don't think I've have been able to get through an entire one on my own, though, because it was pretty rich. Everybody I was with enjoyed their meals; our table got rather quiet as soon as the food arrived, and all of our plates were empty when we left.

I'm a big fan of brunch, and I'm sure that I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"Well we had been to the other location on Country Club over a couple years ago and loved it! This location in Mesa was just as great! Superb customer service skills by Sandy. She just started and we hope they keep her happy. Our morning went smoothly with Sandy serving us. She has an amazing talent of quality service, an infectious smile, kind-hearted, professional demeanor and so very helpful. She knows what is exactly on the menu and where to find it. We need more service people like her who clearly serve with pride and integrity. Thank you, Sandy! Also met the GM Steven who came to our table because we had a question. He was professional and respectful. We will return to this restaurant for sure. Service is everything but also really yummy good food helps. I ordered the Mixed Berry Cheese Blintz and it is to die for. YUM! My guest ordered the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict (they gave it another name so I'm sorry I forgot). This was a tasty meal too. Highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast and lunch! Clean bathrooms. Clean place. Nice atmosphere. Also helpful staff up front. Thank you for this great experience."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty busy during breakfast on the weekends but we went for a Friday brunch and had no problems being seated immediately. Great service and delicious breakfast. Skillets are yummy. This time I got the Crab Cake Benedict. Large portion and so tasty. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I found this place hidden away in an industrial business park using the Yelp app.  It was awesome!  We were warmly greeted, and immediately seated.  My cousin had coffee in her hand immediately, and I was served my iced tea.  

I went with the carnitas huevos rancheros, and man was it ever good.  They definitely don't skimp on the meat.  My cousin got the garden omelette and they were happy to substitute avocado for the broccoli.  

I'm not often in the Mesa area, but if I was I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast on a Sunday. I had the Denver omelet, which was delicious. However, the environment is really awful here. Aside from the horrible decorations, there are way too many tables and they are very close together. It was extremely hard to carry on conversation due to how loud it was and the sheer lack of privacy from the next table only a few feet away."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  Get fresh food.  The bread and soups are made daily!  This place is only open for breakfast and lunch but always busy but we'll worth waiting if you ever should have too.."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch with my mom and tried it out for both our first times- it was a pleasant experience and food was good as well. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my wife and inlaws after the first place we went to had an hour wait.  Came here based upon the reviews on Yelp.  After waiting 20 minutes for a table, I ordered the traditional breakfast with the flat-iron steak.  I ordered the steak medium, but it came well done.  The eggs and potatoes were okay, but nothing really special.  The english muffin was good.  The service was good, but three stars based upon the food.  Nothing was terrible, but nothing amazed me either.  I expected more for the wait."}
{"text":"We love his place and have eaten here a couple times in the past month!! The service is great, the food is delicious and it's definitely become one of our favorites for breakfast! The carnitas breakfasts with salsa verde are all amazing! My husband also really enjoys the blintzes with fruit on top. We'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Another Breakfast stop in our Spring training galavant. This one was somewhat close to Hohokam stadium and the Yelpers said good things about it. SO, off we went. 

This place is in a very industrial looking complex on a side street behind Home Depot. .There is also a hotel nearby, likely where a little of the traffic to this place comes from. It is pretty unsuspecting when you see it, but you will not be disappointed. 

The place does have some outdoor seating and also a very big dining area. We were seated quickly and then had the duty of trying to decide what to have. There are lots of choices, pancakes, waffles, eggs, omelets, etc. And if you eat breakfast like we do, at 10-11am, lunch even starts looking tempting. We try not to be too distracted. 

The restaurant was moderately crowded. The lunch crowd really filled in toward the end of our meal. We finally decided on a waffle sandwich for me and SG had a sausage, bacon and cheddar cheese omelette. Both of us were very pleased with what we ordered. My waffle had a big rooster in the middle (image on the waffle grill). SG enjoyed his very meaty breakfast. Perfect protein to get through the rest of the day at the ballgame. 

We did have trouble getting our bill and settling up. Our waiter had great trouble it seems with running our credit card. We will have to make sure to look at our bill and make sure they did not bill us 5 times. 

Overall a very good breakfast, especially if you are headed out to Mesa for something. And, they serve it all day long, so you do not have to rush."}
{"text":"Always good food! Love to get the california club and fries! Nothing like coming into work just waiting to go to crackers and co for lunch! Fresh ingredients and sweet staff."}
{"text":"I had a very good breakfast skillet this morning. The food was good and the service was very attentive as well. Compared to the last 2 mediocre dinners (each over $70 just for me) I had a much better experience. That is why I left a 100% tip - and a nice note in the receipt."}
{"text":"biscuit was as fluffy as a mature stratocumulus cloud in a low pressure system in a favorable climate"}
{"text":"Place looks a little run down and questionable, but the food... O M G!! Everything we got was amazing. I got the banana and Nutella crepe to go for my husband, and he loved it!
We sat at the bar because. They're  was a wait and our server/bartender was great!
 Affordable, really great food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Had the \"new princess omelette\" and it brought tears to my eyes.  Saturday morning service was a tad slow, but that was expected."}
{"text":"I just discovered this wonderful breakfast and lunch spot, thanks to \"Yelp.\"  Like others of its kind, it features a generous four page menu of breakfast options.  First are the hearty skillets such as the southwest carnitas with tender pork, spicy chorizo, cracker's country potatoes, and shredded cheeses, topped with baha sauce and tomatillo sauce.  Next are  fluffy omelets such as the New Princess - lightly spiced with tender chunks of chicken sauteed with mushrooms, broccoli, bacon, and onions stuffed with cream cheese and topped with creamy hollandaise.  Sensational flavors for breaking the fast!  Prices range from $8.29-8.99.

Traditional items include huevos rancheros, and a variety of eggs Benedict.  Your taste buds will be California dreamin' with the California Eggs Benny, a fresh and bold combination. (spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes and two large poached eggs topped with hollandaise)

Last but not least, pancakes, Belgian waffles, European crepes, and blintzes grace the pages of this indulgent breakfast menu.

But the highlight is Cracker and Co.'s homemade desserts.  Wrap your senses around the cinnamon brandied blackberry bread pudding, raspberry chocolate fudge cake, or the Texas kahlua brownie.  Without a doubt, the most divine bread pudding to ever dazzle my senses!

As most breakfast and lunch spots, it is only open until 2:30p.  Expect a wait when coming here for brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food!! Was a little skeptical on the interior because it kind of looks like an Italian restaurant but the food is home cooked country style. Yelp never let's me down!"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything I did not LOVE here! The pork carnitas are amazing, pancakes are fluffy with just slight crisp on the edges, eggs Benedict will rock your world and any skillet is a good choice! Service is always friendly and on point!"}
{"text":"Spending time in this area with other people make it a lot more bearable. Something else that makes it bearable-Yelping good food. 

My mom was leaving this morning and she wanted me to look up a good place for breakfast. We settled on Crackers & Co Cafe because it was close to her friend's house and we could pick her up. On the way over, though, my mom saw people were waiting outside and dropped me off so I could start waiting--good thinking! They took my name and told me it would be about 15 minutes.

20 minutes later, my mom and her friend arrived just as my name was called. We were seated promptly in a corner table under the some windows, with convenient view of 2 flat-screen televisions, both broadcasting CNN. A little distracting but whatever. 

We were seated around 11 AM and by then my mom and I were no longer in the mood for breakfast foods. My mom's friend started with a Mango Iced Tea and I got the Strawberry Peach Iced Tea. They came quickly but tasted like something from a fountain or mix; very sweet and cool, but almost no tea-taste. They tasted fine, but I'm not sure that it was actually a fresh iced tea as it said on the menu. 

We ordered: 

Half-sandwich and soup: My mom got half a roast beef and provolone on wheat sandwich, with a bowl of Clam Chowder (usually only on Fridays but it was the Soup du Jour today). The roast beef was sliced very thin but there was a good amount, so much that my mom deconstructed her sandwich. The beef had a good texture but the sandwich overall was pretty bland. The clam chowder was delicious, thick and creamy but somehow still appropriate for a warm day because of the huge chunks of clams and mealy potato. Add a little Cholula and I'm all there (stole a lot of spoonfulls, actually).

Belgian Waffle: My mom's friend asked if the toppings were fresh and the waitress answered honestly that the blackberries and blueberries were frozen but the strawberries were fresh. It came hot off the griddle with butter and a good amount of topping, but no syrup--we had to ask and someone else, I believe a manager, brought it over promptly. 

The Californian - I'm eating the leftovers of this sandwich as we speak.. which is roasted chicken breast, red onions, sprouts, avocado, tomato, and mayo on whole wheat bread. It was served with some really delicious fries; very crispy with a difficult to describe crustiness to it. Trust me, very good. The sandwich had a lot of flavor but you want to eat the pickle that comes with it for sure, to bring it together. I should've asked for mustard to be added but forgot. (Also, I just want to know why California-style food is associated with avocado? I love me some avo but it's not like Californians put it on their steak and in their drinks or something.) 

Overall, the food was pretty good for the price, the service attentive, and the place busy but still conducive to pleasant conversation. Oh, and free refills on the drink. Hopefully I'll get another chance to eat here before I leave."}
{"text":"Whenever I want an eggs benedict, this is my go-to spot. They have the best California eggs benedict I've had so far in my life and that's the only breakfast I order here.

It comes with two English muffins underneath two poached eggs cooked how you'd like (medium), tomatoes, crispy bacon, avocados, and spinach all drenched with creamy hollandaise sauce.

Make sure your bite has every piece in it, it's amazing! I always put Tabasco on mine too for some kick. The side of potatoes that come along with it are tasty as well and it's good to soak up some of the excess yolk and sauce with it. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is apparently only appealing because it's been around since the 80s. It still looks the same as it did back then. Our waiter was lazy. And my food was not good. My soup was disgusting and oily and the sandwhich was soggy from being soaked in pure garlic. My mouth tasted like garlic for the next 8 hours. Disgusting. Over priced. Not good. Bad service. Why do people vote on places like this?? I don't care how long it's been around. It's terrible."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for our family! We have had so many celebrations at this location. The service here is wonderful! From the hostesses ,the assistant manager,  and wait staff, all is great! Okay now for the food, also wonderful! Thank you for always giving us a relaxed and memorable time!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent breakfast and lunch is to die for, service was nice and fast friendly.  I'm in town and coming back in the am"}
{"text":"They are always busy with good reason....they have good food. I go Maybe 3 or 4 times a month. The service is always friendly, fast and professional. I love breakfast and they have a huge selection of items including specials that are creative and tasty.  If you are looking for a good breakfast spot...think about Crackers..they won't let you down!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Tuscan atmosphere, delicious food! They use a European coffee press, and I am not exaggerating , best coffee in the valley!"}
{"text":"Still Loving Crackers after all this time! 
They are one of the few places I've been to recently that doesn't seem to be cutting corners and going down hill! 

One of my favorite lunches is the \"Turkey Avocado Melt\" it's called the Roast Beef Avocado Melt on the menu but I always get it with Turkey and a side of fruit!(see pics) 
Maybe it's the special sauce or that light and crispy grilled sourdough garlic bread but it's a Damn Good Sandwich I find ,my self craving all too often!

Try it you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places for breakfast. 

The new location is OK, I've had some minor issues during lunch time but our breakfast the other day was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!

I Love the California Benny, An English muffin layered with spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes and two large poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce, Served with Crackers Country Potatoes(see pics) 

The Husband always gets the Vatican Skillet which is A layer of Crackers Country Potatoes mixed with breakfast sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, topped with cheddar cheese and two eggs any style (see pics) with a side of pancakes instead of toast, I think it's .99 cents more.

Crackers is just a great place for home cooking with a huge menu and tons of dessert, I have several favorites!
Check it out I think you'll agree.

Open 7am -2:30pm."}
{"text":"This place is always good every time I come here. Amazing breakfast dishes for sure and quick service. Friendly staff that is attentive to their customers. Eggs Benedict is a favorite. Also recommend their French toast.  Try the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, SO DELICIOUS!!!! Big portions! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Lovely little breakfast place in Tempe. Swung by here Sunday morning around 10AM with MH and MC to try to beat the brunch crowd, which we did! Got seated within 10 min! When we left around 11:30 it was definitely a lot more crowded and the wait looked to be about 25-30 min. 

I ordered the SOUTHWEST CHORIZO CARNITAS with over easy eggs and it was delicious!! The chorizo and carnitas were really flavorful and juicy, which paired perfectly with the potatoes, cheese, and eggs. It came with a giant tortilla and the portion was a decent size. I couldn't finish all of it and had to pack half of it home. 

The waitress was very attentive and quick with our orders, which was nice given how busy the place got as the morning went on. 

I would definitely recommend this place. Solid breakfast with good sized portions."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It's my go-to brunch spot. Everything here is delicious:) No seriously, EVERYTHING! The prices are great and the service is so friendly. This place is a must try, you'll absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend, will return (patronized Tempe location). Everything went well from food, service, environment....no complaints. Just wish there was a closer Crackers by where we live in Prescott!"}
{"text":"So so good. The food was delicious! We sat at the bar and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I have somewhat mixed feelings about Crackers & Co. 
I came her on Memorial Day/my Birthday expecting an above average experience & left slightly disappointed.

- Our Experience: We arrived around 8 AM knowing it would be very busy. Walking in, the restaurant is super cute! The Host stand will be right in front of you, with benches to the side for waiting parties. Country/Chic décor, & a small area to the left of the host stand for take-out orders. Both Hostess' were extremely rude, had attitudes/seemed annoyed with everyone from their coworkers to the customers, & while I'm laying it all out - they both looked dirty. As in, lack of hygiene. Which, started things off on the wrong foot. We ended up sitting on the patio, which was fine since it's shaded and the weather was great that morning! I noticed that there are heaters on the patio for colder mornings which is accommodating for Winter. Our waitress was awesome, but she seemed to be spread a little too thin. Service was a little slow on her part, which her personality made up for! I could see her working extremely hard on other tables, so maybe it was just an understaffed morning. While waiting for our breakfast to arrive the Hostess' kept walking outside calling for the waiting parties. At one point one of the girls called for a party twice, and on the third call for the party, a family came running around the corner apologizing. Her response was \"Next time you need to be ready, I almost gave your table away.\" If that were me in their position, I'd have left. What an unnecessary remark, and a poor way to treat the people who pay your bills. - Once our food came, it was tasty, but my meal was not what I was expecting. I ordered the Carnitas Skillet, thinking the keyword was \"Carnitas.\" I was a little bummed that the majority of my meal was made up of potatoes, I'd say there was about 1.5 ounces of carnitas. If that's how the meal is meant to be prepared, they ought to bring the priced down. $10 for potatoes, a slice of toast, two eggs, & a garnish of Pork carnitas seems a little steep. Luckily, I love potatoes, so I didn't send it back. If I return, I'll try something else. 

- Pros: Friendly waitress, shaded patio, lots of parking, clean, & the coffee was good too!

- Cons: Slightly pricey for breakfast food, rude-Rude-RUDE hostess'. Every other hiccup, I'm just going to assume I came on an off day.

My boyfriend & I live about 1/2 a mile from Crackers & I was hoping we could make this a regular breakfast spot, but after our experience, I don't think we'll return for awhile."}
{"text":"Back in Mesa for the weekend & had to stop at one of fav's for brunch. Normally get their California Benedict which is always yummy, tons of avocados & fabulous hollandaise sauce. Today I got the Pork Carnitas Chilequiles. And it was a great choice. Meat tender, perfectly seasoned. Perfect cure for a night of overindulgence. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Loved the carnitas and eggs Benedict. Will be back. Good service too."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and ordered the Reuben with baked potato soup and a Monte cristo sandwich with a salad. The salad was very gross, wilted and brown so we sent it back only with a laugh from the server. Soup was OK and sandwiches were OK. We might have expected too much from the ratings. I have a feeling breakfast is the only thing you should order. Don't expect much from the service either"}
{"text":"I finally got here before they closed!! I've been trying to eat here since they opened and everything was better than expected. I ordered the Hampton with avocado which is grilled chicken, egg, broccoli, tons of seasoning and cheese. Some people say it's weird eating the chicken and the egg, but I think the combination is great. I ordered sandwiches for the family to go and even though most of their meals are $10, it is worth every penny. My server who works behind the bar was so kind and I need to come back with the family. If only they were open all day!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have expected to find a place to eat behind a home depot and next to a cabinet store but I searched yelp for an inexpensive and highly rated breakfast nearby and was led to this place. Nice decor and atmosphere although I was a little confused that the hostess was wearing a black cocktail dress at 8 am for a cafe breakfast. I think I'd rate the prices as $$ rather than $. You can expect to pay $10 per person for breakfast drinking only water which seems average rather than low priced. The hostess and waitress were both friendly and at 8:15 on a weekday, I was seated promptly and the place was fairly empty. As it is a cafe, the seating is only tables and chairs; no booths but they had a nice outdoor seating area. If you're a vegetarian, the menu looks loaded with meat at first glance but they cheerfully customized my order to be meat free and charged me less for it. Plenty of food! I walked out with extras and won't be hungry again until dinner. Good place to eat but I can't seem to justify the glowing 5 star reviews I'd read. Room for improvement: change the radio station unless you really want teenage girls to be your only clientele and make a menu selection for healthy/low cal/light options."}
{"text":"Now that we've had a chance to try some other items on the breakfast menu, it's a good time to update the review.

Recently, in addition to the Traditional Benny, we tried the California Eggs Benny, Traditional Breakfast and Breakfast 222.  Also, we tried two dessert items---Brandied Cinnamon Bread Pudding and the Lemon tart.

This place, generally speaking, is consistently good.  The only thing, IMO,  they could improve on is their poached egg preparation.  Sometimes the eggs get poached just right, other times they are overcooked.  All that said, the California Eggs Benny is a delicious and unique breakfast.  In addition to the English muffin and Hollandaise sauce, it has spinach, bacon, avocados and tomatoes.  It all works well together and is very tasty.

The Traditional Breakfast and the Breakfast 222 are very similar.  Both have 2 eggs and your choice of meat.  Where they differ is that the Traditional  has potatoes plus toast, although you can substitute pancakes for the toast for a little extra cost.  The pancakes are buttermilk and, IMO, are better than IHOP.

One day we got tempted by the dessert menu. I ordered the Brandied Cinnamon Bread Pudding while my husband ordered the Lemon Tart.  The bread pudding was delicious!  Our waitress got it right when she said it didn't taste like typical bread pudding.  It has a blackberry sauce and is topped with fresh whipped cream---it's simply decadent.  The lemon tart, however, was not your typical one.  It's thicker than usual and the crust not as crispy.  Still, my husband enjoyed it.

You know, we've never had a bad server in the place.  In fact, most have been friendly and efficient.  If we thought we were treated badly, we wouldn't go back.  In fact, we think that this is a great breakfast restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came to this place before weekly shopping in Costco. Food were really good! I love my steak egg Benedict, love them! Country potatoes are very good too! My husband kept asking me to try his meal. No thank you! I am enjoying mine. He loved his too. Will come back. Food 5 Star! Service 4 Star"}
{"text":"This place has slowly gone from really good to good.  The food is good, service not so good.  Today our family had a pancake breakfast and a couple of BLT sandwiches.  Knowing they put very little mayo on their BLTs I asked for extra mayo which they eventually brought.  The table next to us had 4 young men whom the waiter knew, so even though they sat 15 minutes after we did, they got regular service while we got ignored.  We eventually got our food even though we had to ask for silverware after the food was brought, which came after the table next to us got serviced again.  I was surprised when I got the check to see the extra mayo was on the bill.  While it was only 59 cents I asked the waiter why I was being charged for something on the menu and listed as part of the sandwich?  The reply I received is they \"have to\" and that was it.  I could care less about the 59 cents but I wonder if the irritation is really worth it to management?  The little things like the extra charges, not having silverware and the super slow service will just probably lead to us choosing some other restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews already posted - this place was great.  Visited recently on a Saturday morning, were seated quickly - - and what a great with the California Benny - dang!  It was just great - presentation lovely - accomodated a 1/2 order for 2 at the table, and the wait staff very efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"We had our wedding luncheon here and it was great! The food was wonderful and because we had a big party they helped us make a custom menu. We waited a bit longer than what we originally anticipated, but the staff's service made up for that. Will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat.  Great.  Clean. Great food and service.  Classy and close to my house.  Love love love it!"}
{"text":"The coffee was amazing and the food was nothing short of delicious. Great spot for breakfast/brunch but it's definitely more of a family oriented establishment so don't expect any crazy mimosa parties. I had the pancakes which were fluffy and cooked perfectly. Will definitely be coming back if the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Get the chicken fried chicken on top of a waffle and then topped with eggs (your way) and a side of chorizo gravy....NOW! The bf and I will be living closer to this place soon and that could be dangerous. Mariah was a great server, super cute and friendly! I asked for a to go cup for my diet coke and she brought a giant cup already filled with diet coke yumminess! Score! \"To go\" beverages is something i can definitely get used to and seems to be an AZ thing. 
I sampled the bfs omelet and potatoes and they were also flavorful and awesome. Cannot wait to go back! My mom will love this place when she visits."}
{"text":"I am actually sitting in the restaurant as I write this Yelp review, I've been going to crackers for a year or so now and have always seemed to have the slowest service in the restaurant industry, they do not come and check in on their customers that don't mind tiping well on service, the food is always cold, I have had them return food once every time, this company needs to step it up"}
{"text":"The only way you are going to find out about this place is by word of mouth, Yelp, or pure accident.  Well worth the visit.  I'm a breakfast guy.  I happened to visit early in the am and there was plenty of seating.  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  Good selection on the menu.  I went with the Vatican breakfast skillet.  Meal came out very quickly, which was a surprise.  Eggs were perfectly prepared over easy, as I requested.  I really enjoyed the meal and it was filling.  Food was good quality and priced well. Next time I'm in the area I will definitely stop by and try something different on the menu.  I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and atmosphere... Hearty delicious meals with great service! Highly recommended if wanting breakfast and a chain restraunt doesnt cut it anymore"}
{"text":"The Southwest incarnate that was very good. And I had the chicken Roma sourdough Sandwich was also very tasty. Service was nice. Quiet and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Ok, so I went here on a Saturday morning last weekend and it was awful. I loved that it was tucked away and had ample parking even though the lot was pretty full. I was seated right away. I ordered the cinnamon sugar french toast even after having my doubts from seeing it brought out to someone else. Ugh I hate when I don't go with my gut instinct against something!! It wasn't soaked with the batter all the way through so it was like dry bread on the inside. There wasn't enough cinnamon either. Not sure why it is allowed to carry that name or be on their favorites list! There was plenty to eat though, so if you don't require flavor, it will be filling.
I began talking to a couple sitting next to me during the meal and they too were out hunting for a good breakfast in the east valley. He ordered a skillet. It didn't come out in a skillet and it was more like a stew than a skillet. It was so wet and disgusting. I hadn't gotten to her before they ordered so she had the french toast as well and it was just a bland for her. She covered hers in syrup and said it was much better that way but I believe if a steak is good you don't add A1 and if a pancake, french toast or waffle is good it doesn't need it either!! Not sure why everyone else had such a great experience here! Probably just all of my bad luck!"}
{"text":"Man, I wish I could come here every week! 

Came in for my birthday breakfast and got the Musketeer omelette - very good and perfectly cooked with a side of pan-fried sliced potatoes. The coffee was amazing for being plain ol' coffee (it had a brand on the menu but I forgot [again] to write it down). 

Right now, they have a bunch of seasonal pumpkin dishes on offer. We tried the pumpkin bread pudding and it was AWESOME. I want to come in soon and try the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes."}
{"text":"Crackers & Co is a 4.5 only if we're on a 10-point scale.  I went with a party of four and we were all very underwhelmed with the slop served here.  Maybe we went on a bad day, but our disappointment went as far as the quality of the ingredients, which isn't something that typically varies on a day-to-day basis.  

Now, TC Eggington's is a decent breakfast spot.  I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly. 

I wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.  I want to help others avoid going here with high hopes of an outstanding breakfast and come away with a belly full of unmemorable food.  What has happened to our standards for a good traditional American breakfast?"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good - but do NOT order via Yelp... I was given prices that were about $1 lower than expected and they do not have the online payment setup. I ended up being quoted $12.27 on the Yelp order and walked out with my food paying $17.89 with very little explanation of why the prices were so off (and no apologies for the issue). 

Worth a shot if you have the time to sit down and eat there. But I'm fairly busy and prefer online ordering for takeout - I'll most likely be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for helping me find this jewel of the desert... Took my daughter to breakfast here and it was great.  Service was prompt, and courteous, the restaurant is comfortable and well lit. She had french toast and the breakfast burrito, I had the eggs Benedict. She offered me a preference to my eggs, suggesting that medium would be normal on the poached egg. The reason we are at 4 stars and not five is that the eggs on my plate arrived with fully cooked yolk. The waitress was very accommodating after I pointed it out. She brought me a second plate shortly thereafter. It worked out well because we were planning on splitting the cinnamon french toast anyway. The second set of eggs Benedict the eggs were correct but the hollandaise was bland. I will try something else next round as this place has many items that temp me... One last note we were celibrating my daughters birthday, the server brought us a lovely brownie for her big day. Thank you for a great place to go and share some time with my \"baby\" girl."}
{"text":"Waitress was really nice but the food was just \"ok\".  We sat outside - not bothered by any insects but the road noise from vehicles driving by made the dining experience a little less enjoyable.  We will probably try it one more time but sit inside instead."}
{"text":"LEcker!! Another good place to find your breakfast, brunch, lunch!. I tried the healthy granola pancake and the tortilla chicken soup. The place has nice decoration and even when you have full house, the noise is not disturbing. Good attention and even parking places!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you but I only order 1 or 2 things from almost every restaurant I frequent, except for Crackers. This place is one of the very few that I will \"experiment\" and leave my tried and true policy of \"my usual\". I have never had a bad experience trying anything on their menu in the past 30+ years (hard to believe) I have frequented them. Everything they offer is absolutely delicious! Always a treat!"}
{"text":"I'm one to always look around for random places that are locally owned and not a franchiase. Came accross this place on my yelp sweep for good breakfast and brunch places. Very nice place with fast and friendly service. Was right away greeted and seated, brought our drinks and took our order. Food was really good, had the Southwest Eggs Benedict. Was full of favor, just wish it had a little more spice as I'm a fan of spicy food. Would I recommend this place to others yes, will I return yes."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Service and food are the best. California eggs Benedict are delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places here in the East Valley.  Excellent quality, monthly specials to die for and fantastic service.  

When we walked in, we were told today \"20 minute wait.\"  Less than ten minutes later, we were at our table.  My point?  Under promise and over deliver = standard operating procedure at Crackers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. We were greeted right away and seated. Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to look over the menus. I decided on the oatmeal. It comes with milk, brown sugar and raisins on the side. It was very good and filling. The decor is casual, and the service was good. We will be back to sample different menu items."}
{"text":"There I was at Discount tire early this morning hoping to be at least one of the first 3 to get in. Well that didn't happen so I realized I needed a place to go. And there was Crackers across the street. Ok maybe not right across but close enough to walk.

The first thing I saw as I approached was a big line of chairs outside. That might mean people like this place?? 

Apparently because it was busy. But I got a great seat near a window and service was excellent. The waitress knew her menu and made recomendations when I asked. She even knew to ask me what I generally liked and was I looking for that or somethng different. Smart!

In the end I ordered the same thing I have for 50 years, eggs, bacon, tomatoes and toast. 

Service is great, no blaring music, servers who pay attention but don't hover, good coffee, and busy with people who look like they return a lot.

Breakfast is pretty hard to screw up but the bacon and the eggs are the give a way. Crisp doesn't  mean burned, and over mediam means soft yellow but finished egg. They got it absolutely perfect. Even the toast was warm, when it was delivered.

Now I have to add them to my list of regulars like the Hoosier Cafe in Chandler wher I go every Sunday."}
{"text":"How I loved this place!!! In my visit about a week ago I stopped in twice. I saw a few reviews from my yelp friends and made it a point to stop in (thank you specifically Susan!!!!!)
The servers where spectacular!!! I saw the servers actually paying so much attention to their customers. For example all around me the servers actually sitting across their customers and asking them how they were doing and really caring. Now me being a NYer I couldn't believe people are that super nice!!!!! They made their customers feel really special and it was evident and obvious to me.  The food was pretty darn good too!!!! 

Three cheers to the Mesa servers at this establishment for what I witness this genuine love of people with a great food product!!!  
Seeing this made the two visits one of the highlights of a very productive trip."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place for breakfast this morning but left very dissapointed. We waited 30 minutes for a table just to find several empty tables they weren't even bothering to fill. Our waiter came over very promptly, took our drink order and I ordered a side of bacon for my son so he would have something while we waited. It took 20 minutes for the bacon to come out, the waiter got that order wrong (how do you mess up a side of bacon?). We placed our order after a few minutes and then waited another 20 minutes for our food to come out while our waiter was chatting with other wait staff. The manager brought our food to the table to find out it had all been sitting on the warmer and our food was actually cold. The waiter never came back by to ask how the food was or make sure we had what we needed, including needing refills on our drinks. He came by just as we finished to drop off the check. 

Maybe the food would have been better during a less busy time but I'm not willing to go back and try. Very dissapointed and will make sure to tell others about our experience."}
{"text":"The bad news first: on my most recent outing to crackers, my friend and I decided to split two dishes, one sweet and one savory. I, being the more manly of the group, ordered the pork carnitas skillet. He ordered the more feminine euro crepes with triple berry sauce.  When the plates arrived, I was tasked with dividing the carnitas, he with splitting the crepes. The crepe splitting went off without a hitch, and let me just say, they were quite delicious. The carnitas division wasn't quite as smooth. My fork pressed a straight line perfectly measured through the center of the plate. The volume of each side was perfectly measured and both sides were consistent in both volume and mass.  As I bit down into the first scoop, my taste buds screamed an exultant \"hoorah!\"  It was tender and delicious. The eggs, the potatoes, the cheese, and the pork. Oh my....the pork: so flavorful, so plentiful. Seriously, lots of pork. A little light on the potatoes, for my liking. As I shoveled the carnitas into my eager chompers, my date looked on with amusement as my male counterpart and his date picked delicately at their respective crepe plates and traded clever conversation. 

I was inhaling the last crumbs of my delectable, explosive pork delight, when my friend began his portion. It wasn't long before the reality and horror of my error became evident: my dear poor friend, stirred his plate, and pressed the potatoes from side to side. To his great dismay, there was a conspicuous scarcity, nay, a dearth...of pork!   How could this be?! I had carefully measured and divided the dish meticulously, and most carefully. Surely it could not be my mistake. Quickly, the explanation began to materialize and crystallize in my mind:  the waitress, being overcome with my charm (and early morning bed head) clearly instructed the cook to place the pig's share of pork on my side.   While flattered, I cannot condone such blatant discrimination. I am now forced to somehow resolve the guilt that plagues me for being, through no fault of my own, better looking and more charming than my friend. Crackers really needs to address these prejudices. It's 2014, for Pete's sake!!

Now the good news. I've tried lots on this menu and it's a consistent oral nirvana. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have never eaten here before... We loved it!!! breakfast was a California Eggs Benedict. The best eggs benedict I have ever had... we shared; thank God, because one person could not eat the gigantic portion.  We also shared the steel cut oatmeal which was also very good.  Looking around at other peoples food we noticed that the portions where huge and good looks great!  The service was great and staff very friendly.  We will definitely be back! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere is nice, very open and comfortable. We had California Eggs Benedict & a Giant Cinnamon Roll. All of their desserts/cakes are made from scratch. All of it was a 10/10 and we will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This business defies the old adage location, location, location.  It's hard to find but oh so worth it, you'll know your there because you'll see all the cars.  The food is actually made with love.  I had an omelet, it was tender and delicious!  I have never used this term in a review once.  The manager walked through the resturaunt continuously, he asked us how our meal was.  the staff was happy, the customers were happy, I WAS HAPPY!!!!  I hope you will go and enjoy this wonderful little breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"I ordered the oatmeal with strawberries and blueberries. The oatmeal seemed fresh, and not too soggy like most restaurants. The fruit was fresh cut, which I appreciated. 

I'm a huge orange juice fanatic and theirs is far from fresh and definitely tasted like it was from concentrate. Boo 

The waitress was efficient, but not overly friendly. 

If they step up their orange juice game I will return."}
{"text":"We took my folks here for Sunday brunch and it did not disappoint. 
Great breakfast food, fast friendly service. 
I recommend that you try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Delicious Food! Entertainment of  the decorations by the staff.... 
Highly  recommended
By both of us!! If we lived closer.... might be A Habit I would develop!!"}
{"text":"Positive: Warm and welcoming interior. Attentive staff. Every single item we ordered was extra tasty. I had the baked potato soup and the chicken salad sandwich. My co-workers really enjoy their roast beef sandwich and their breakfast options. 

Negative: difficult to find, industrial exterior"}
{"text":"Early Wednesday morning, Not busy at all no waiting. Had the Southwest eggs Benedict which were fantastic and a sample of the biscuits and gravy, very good. Ty was our server did an excellent job great place to go.
My wife and I split the eggs Benny, 2 cups of coffee, total bill was just under $20."}
{"text":"We arrived and the place was packed. (Mothers day) the hostess and the rest of the staff was super friendly and although there was a 45 minute wait they ensured we were happy and comfortable. Maria (our fabulous server) brought me coffee as we waited in the lobby. The staff worked their magic and we were seated within less than 10 minutes. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was friendly and very nice. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has terrible customer service, when you call the people who answer is extremely rude! I would never spend any money here!!"}
{"text":"Only ate here once--and that was plenty for us.  Sunday AM and the place was packed.  Waited 30 minutes for a table.  VERY cramped, crowded, and LOUD.  Service was lackadaisical at best.  All their food comes from some sort of restaurant supply company and is then reheated and served.  Not sure where the rave reviews here come from--must be Americans who can't live without food loaded with salts and other preservatives.  Final tally over $40 for two people--no drinks.  I could have prepared a better breakfast at home with grocery store ingredients--and I'm a horrible cook.  Every time we drive by the wife and I smirk and cry out our nickname for this place:  \"Crappers\" cafe."}
{"text":"I'm here every week for a business breakfast,  I've had just about everything on the breakfast menu and it's consistantly good. Great sevice, Kim is wonderful."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is very different from most breakfast places. Original, delicious, and clean."}
{"text":"I come here every sunday after church, I love their three musketeers omelet, california benny, country fried steak and anything on the lunch menu...in general this place is awesome, great food, awesome servers. Sometimes service might be slow but only because they have to tend to alot of tables. Oh its cheap too! Btw if you don't want to wait, call ahead and make a reservation! :)"}
{"text":"biscuits and gravy were amazing , this will become a staple for us for sure the atmosphere was right up our alley. i feel like the owners of this establishment really cares about the overall dining experience of it's guests, you could tell very easily , all the staff looked very professional,and did their jobs that way."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I was here last and everything was as I expected. Great Service and an extensive menu. 

I ordered my favorite - the New Princess omelet - filled with chicken, veggies and cream cheese topped with hollandaise sauce. Large side of potatoes and toast.  Everything was great.  I forgot to ask for my potatoes to be extra crispy, so they were a bit soft for my taste. So be sure to note that if you want crispy potatoes.  

My companion had the classic Benedict, and she ate every bite!  The hubby had their special French toast with apple cranberry which comes with bacon and eggs.  He was a little disappointed with the French toast. It was the thick bread which is not his preference.  

Love the little carafes they give you for coffee refills.  And choice of creamers. They also have a bar for mimosas and bloody Mary's as well as other adult beverages.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"Crackers is awesome! Service was great and prompt. Rachel rocked! I had the Spicy Mexican Skillet and it was amazing! Great place but hard to spot."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and it is usually not that busy during the weekdays. We were greeted nicely and sat quickly. I ordered eggs, pancakes and bacon which were great. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the coffee was bland and I think for breakfast places coffee is very important."}
{"text":"I had a California Eggs Benedict based on a review from Yelp. It was the best decision I had all day. We have come to Crackers and Co before and enjoyed every meal we have ever tasted. We met the nicest server at their other location who had been with the resturaunt for 20 years. The best part of this restaurant is their coffee. I've never enjoyed a cup anywhere else as much as Cracker's and Co."}
{"text":"Crackers has been my go to brunch place for years but recently I've noticed a decline in the quality of food. Service? No complaints. The waitresses are always fabulous. Ambience? Very nice. A big step up from your traditional ihop or village inn. 

But at the end of the day it's the food that matters most. I'm giving crackers a 3 because:
-Their portion sizes have rapidly decreased
-biscuits and gravy was underwhelming
-plating is a nightmare. I've gotten the ca eggs Benny a couple times where the egg didn't ever make it on to the English muffin. The hollandaise sauce has also decreased in portion size. 
-potatoes never have any flavor/salt

Overall the taste is still okay (it's gotten worse though) which is why crackers still gets 3 stars but hopefully the  heads will start stepping their game up because I don't want to have to take anyone else here and be embarrassed by the quality. 

But like I said, some things I've gotten are still delicious so overall I'd recommend
-blintzes 
-California eggs benedict"}
{"text":"I've been going to Crackers for years, since I moved in nearby.  The food is always wonderful!  If you order anything with the carnitas, you will not be disappointed.  My favorite breakfast is the chorizo and carnitas skillet, and my favorite lunch item is the carnitas melt.  Always tender and perfect!  When family and friends come to visit me in Tempe, I bring them here.  It's always a big hit!  Other must-try items: French toast, Nutella crepes and loaded baked potato soup.  I hear the bread pudding is delicious, but I'm always too full for dessert!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently with a friend who mentioned it! I had never heard of it before, but then again I don't live in Mesa.

We initially went here to get breakfast since I love breakfast places, but both of us ended up getting lunch. I got a hamburger and it was great, but my only complaint is that the bun was dry. Which is a big no no with burgers, cause if the bun is dry, the whole thing crumbles apart, so hence the minus one star. The fries were freaking delicious though! Great service, too.

They should do a Groupon! I would buy it!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp! Let's be honest, there's really no other way you could find it. This little gem is tucked behind a Home Depot just off of country club nearby the interstate. The service is great and everything on the menu is amazing. I've been here many times since finding it with family, friends, and the girlfriend and we will continue to come in the future. The breakfast skillets are really good and you can never go wrong with the pancakes. 

The only downside is that the way the tables are laid out in the restaurant does make it a little cramped. Especially be prepared to feel like people are super close to you if you come during breakfast time, as they tend to be quite busy! 

Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I'm a waffle fan. I love me my waffles, but this place fell a little short in that department. I have tasted some amazing Belgian waffles before and this one was just \"eh\". Don't get me wrong, it was good, but didn't knock my socks off. The food is hit or miss here; never consistent. Their breakfast potatoes are pretty bland, they lack spices and salt for that matter. The plus side is that the staff is friendly and fast. The coffee was average. Overall, this place is just average. If you're looking for a quick decent bite, stop on by."}
{"text":"At last I get to do a solid 5 and wish I could go higher. What a wonderful breakfast. The 4 of us had different selections and each one was a solid 5. My Calif. Egg Benedict was the best and I wanted to give it a 10. Perfect balance of egg, bacon, spinach, avocado and tomato with a out of this world sauce. The very best I have ever had.
Yes I will be tickled to take any visitors to Crackers for breakfast. You gotta try this place for sure."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I recommend the California Eggs Benedict. Service & ambiance top notch!"}
{"text":"Crackers and Co is pretty fantastic. My husband loves the Meat Lover's Omelet, and I always get the California Eggs Benny- yum! The coffee is tasty, and the servers are fast and friendly. 
I usually enjoy their potatoes that come on the side, but on a few occasions they have been a bit mushy and undercooked for my taste.This location tends to be a bit busier than their other ones, but even when there is a wait, it's usually not too long.
I'm going to keep coming back here, it's one of my favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I love Crackers and Co. I usually go to the location in Tempe, but decided to try this location because it is a little closer to home. 
When we walked in, there was no wait which was fantastic- at the other location we rarely walk right in. I have a gripe about one of the hostesses though- when we walked in she didn't greet us and didn't smile at all. Luckily, another hostess walked up and took care of us. 
After that, the experience was better. Our server was fast and attentive. I got the California Eggs Benny (my usual) and it was good, but I was disappointed that the avocados were brown. My dad enjoyed his skillet, and my mom liked her Eggs Benedict. My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich with regular bacon, but it came out with Canadian bacon. Even after we got it fixed, the sandwich was dry and just okay.
Overall, the other location is worth the wait and the drive for us. The food is a bit better there, and the hostesses are always on their game."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled coming from the DC area but this was appalling. I heard the biscuits were heavenly- they were dry and crumbly and barely worth eating. The spinach omelette I had was such a mess - it was actually unappetizing to look at and tasted so bland that I had to cover it with tabasco. The salads my co-workers had looked uninspired. I am shocked that this place had a 4.5 star rating."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. They have a nice patio as well. I loved it! Try the oatmeal."}
{"text":"Amazing food every single time!! Always looking forward to the next visit! Thanks for staying consistently awesome!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  Even on a busy Sunday morning the wait was only about 10 minutes and they move things along quickly.  It probably took 10 minutes from the time we sat down until we were eating.  The food was big in portions and tasty.  The 222 was a great breakfast and the skillets look tasty.  I especially enjoyed the pancakes.  I had the granola and berries version and that came with a large serving of strawberries, blueberries and whipped cream.  

If you're out and about and looking for a good hearty breakfast...here you go!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!  Ordered the Meat Lovers Omelette, with spinach,  side of avocado and cottage cheese. Perfect meal.  Further kudos for having heavy whipping cream for my coffee.   Thank you... You have earned a customer for life..."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday about 9:00 for breakfast and didn't have to wait for a table. Waitress (April) was really nice. Portions are big enough to even share. Ordered lemon blueberry pancake special (delicious), cinnamon roll big enough to split between 3 or 4 people, and Greek omelet with whole olives (yummy).  Food came out fast and they were accommodating 2 large parties of approx 15 ppl which did not alow down the service."}
{"text":"Been here maybe six or seven times since it's been here.  Rather tasty so I don't want to spoil a good thing.
I've had breakfast and lunch items from the menu and so far it's all been rather tasty.

Update 5 12 13
Server Mike, the muffin does have raisins, and it shouldn't take longer than a couple minutes for you to bring it to the table.
I guess you got a bad start when you decided to take the order from the table that was seated well after we had been seated.
Hoping it improves.
The NW corner table booth has the ac directed right on it.  Might be good to know during hot summer days."}
{"text":"Was in the area and checked my trusted Yelp for some eats.  We hit this place at 10am and it was perfect timing.  We were seated quickly and had drinks brought just as fast.  We each ordered the three meat omelette and it was incredible.  It was packed full of meat and covered in cheese.  Great spot off the beaten path."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Tempe. Amazing omelettes, poached eggs, and coffee."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time & I love this place. Awesome food, awesome service & a ton of good coffee!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service!! Can't go wrong here. Highly recommend the bananas foster French toast!! Omelets are to die for! Walked in at 10:30 on a Sunday for a party of 6. Quoted 45 min, not too bad considering it's a Sunday. Got seated about 40 mins after we got there. No complaints at all!!"}
{"text":"Visiting in Mesa for a few days and was looking for a good place for breakfast. This place was hidden a bit, but the food was soooo good. I had an omelet and it was so fresh, potatoes were amazing and the employees were great! We're going back again before we leave!"}
{"text":"Crazy busy on a Sunday morning @10:00, sat at the bar..quick service..both ordered the Calf. Benny,  Next trip the pork carnitas. Waitress recommended the Southwest carnitas which looked awesome.
Great place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Very cool little cafe!  Excellent menu with tons of choices, you wouldn't expect this large of menu in a small sized operation!  Sandwiches were very good and served was outstanding!  Will bookmark this place!"}
{"text":"The best brunch I have had in this area. I had the plain waffle with strawberry blueberry and banana added on it. My friend had the southwest Benedict. Both so delicious."}
{"text":"Here's an update to my previous brief review, after having visited Crackers and Company several more times.

I still really like it, but in my recent visits I've noticed a fluctuation in the quality of service, and portion sizes seem pretty small. Last time I visited was very strange - our server was very brusque and not friendly at all, then halfway through the meal he turned into a smiling, happy-go-lucky guy! (And yes, it was the same person.) It was a little off-putting.

The food, though, is still as delicious as ever and sitting outside is my favorite spot!"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed with the Spicy Mexican or the BLT. This place is always great!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about breakfast and this place did not disappoint. From the atmosphere, food and service I would recommend you go here!"}
{"text":"Amazing once again!  We had the same thing like last time!  But it was soooo good!  For me it was the Southwest Eggs Benny and for Zinny the veggie omelet.  And I love their coffee too.  The thing is I love to go to a restaurant where you want to return to have your favorite or to try more of the menu!  Our waitress was super nice as well!!  Husband was happy too!!"}
{"text":"We got the signature pumpkin cheesecake pancakes and an omelette. The pancakes were all right, not nearly as good as
I was expecting. The cheesecake filling was flavorless. The scrambled eggs that came with it were dry, crumbly, and cold.  My husbands omelette was good and the potatoes were yummy.  We did not get any refills on any of our drinks and I got hot coffee spilled on me when the server dropped the pot as she was refilling another table who were able to get refills.  First time, not going back.  Should have gone to Chompies."}
{"text":"Seriously full and happy! Southwest skillet with chorizo, carnitas, potatoes and a bunch of other crazy good ingredients!! Definitely be back! Thank you"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous breakfast. Our Server, Maria, was very attentive even though it was super busy. We will most certainly come back here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Crackers focuses on breakfast and lunch, closing early every day (2:00p). They do breakfast well and lunch pretty good. If you enjoy French toast, you owe it to yourself to order the Daybreak. Cinnamon vanilla French toast with 2 eggs and bacon (or sub sausage). It's incredibly rich and tasty! Be ready for a nap afterwards. 

My wife swears by the French Chick (chicken salad) or Bird to the Wise (turkey & bacon on croissant). She also goes for the potato soup every time. 

Sometimes the service is a little slow, but this place is crowded during peak hours so arrive early or be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly waitress very attentive to our needs. Great food original cooking. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had the chance to host a ten person party for breakfast in Mesa, AZ, a place from which I knew nothing.  I looked up breakfast and brunch places on where else? Yelp.  The Cracker & Co Cafe is a place I shall not forget anytime soon.  The name suggests a sunny venerated diner.  Nothing like it at all.  A modest storefront opens up to a spacious beautifully decorated dining area.  This restaurant serves breakfast and lunch only, yet the decor could easily pass for a fine French bistro.  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  Our party was seated promptly and approached by our server after everyone settled in.  Jessica, our server introduced herself and offered us beverages.  Ask for Jessica when you go to this restaurant, but make it soon as she shall surely be running a Fortune 500 company soon, I expect.  I have not experienced the level of service we got from her in some of the finer restaurants in New York or Los Angeles.  Jessica was efficient, exact, and pleasant.  Our party ordered ten different items for their main course.  All of my guests, without solicitation, offered their sincere approval of the restaurant, the atmosphere, the food, and the service.  It was a delightful experience."}
{"text":"After searching Yelp for a good breakfast option I chose Cracker & Co.  The place was busy but not chaotic.  Tables weren't jam packed together which isn't always the case for breakfast joints.  We went around the time the after church folks probably go.  We were seated promptly and quickly placed our drink orders.  I chose the Onassis omelet with a side of pancakes (+ strawberries and whip cream).  Not sure what my girlfriend got but she enjoyed hers.  I knew I couldn't finish all that I ordered so I focused on the pancakes, they were very tasty.  The omelet was good but the potatoes on the side were great.  They were thinly sliced instead of little cubes like most places.  We both have plenty of food leftover that we took it home.  

In all, with a coffee, OJ, and our meals it was around $25.  My pancakes were an extra $1 and so were the strawberries and whip cream.  Best breakfast I have had in town and we tried out Brunchie's once from the rave reviews on here.  If you want an overrated breakfast joint, go there.  Way too busy and loud with slightly above average food, but nothing unique.  I doubt I'll go back there even though it is  mile from my gf's house.  But we will definitely make the 3 mile trip up to Crackers and Co. Café.    

The person that complained about a $25 breakfast for 2 two being expensive needs to join the rest of us in the 21st Century.  2 coffees cost $5, the Crab Eggs Benedict isn't even on the menu so either it doesn't exist or was a daily special.  Everyone knows daily specials tend to be pricier, especially if you add seafood to it.  Who orders crab with breakfast anyway?  If you expect real lump crabmeat at a breakfast joint than you shouldn't be eating and ordering it.  Either way that makes your breakfasts about $9 each (left room for tax), since when is that outrageous?  If you want to eat off the Value Meal I am sure McDonald's will be happy to take your order."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. I do think they could add at least one more healthier breakfast item to the menu besides the oatmeal and parfait but I'm a sucker for their California eggs Benedict. I've eaten it every visit since we started going. The wait isn't terrible especially after church on a Sunday and their consistency is on point. My boyfriend gets their biscuits and gravy with sausage and eggs and loves it. The decor is great as well I would definitely suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to eat.  It's like a much better version of Denny's or I-HOP but classier.  I've been coming here for over 20 yrs and it's consistently great.  Love the salads, anything breakfast, burgers, sandwiches.  It's all good.  I've hosted some showers here.

The food is great, desserts are huge and yummy, soups awesome.  

The location of this place is a bit strange in some little strip mall behind Home Depot, but it works for them.  Many people have been going here for many, many years.  They have friendly service and I always leave a big tip."}
{"text":"No greeting when we came in, just 5 hostesses standing around. In the 15 mins we waited for our table not one of them smiled or said hi/goodbye to customers coming and going. Several people waiting yet all 5 of them seem to have time to stand around the hostess stand and see who could get their hands between their shoulder blades the best?? Wait staff was great, helped right away, fast service, food was good but nothing exceptional. What killed it for me was a couple things. One, what looked to be like a 12/13 year old came in with her family to eat and was wearing pajamas....like it wasn't a restaurant but a sleepover at a friends home. Put some clothes on. Second, the people who think the rules with animals don't apply to them. Yes, we were seated outside but if its not a service animal, which it clearly wasn't, he doesn't need to accompany you to breakfast. I watched as the husband stood with the dog (about 6 months old) next to the iron gate outside the dining space. The wife went in, requested a table outside and the hostesses sat her by where the husband was waiting. After the hostess walked away the wife got up, the husband handed the dog to her over the gate and then he proceeded to walk into the restaurant and join her outside at the table.  When the waited approached them you saw him pause, take their drink order and then walk to the busing station where he asked the hostess and others, what's with the the dog, who let them in here with a dog. Yet no one said anything or told them the dog couldn't be there.  No, was not a service dog. No vest, collar, just a leash and two people who were obviously not concerned with fellow diners not wanting a dog staring at them begging while they eat."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed Crackers yet--I love this place. The Southwest Carnitas skillet is probably what I'd want as my last meal on death row. I love the Catalina tuna melt to bits of fishy pieces. The french toast is a cinnamon-marbled marvel. Even the coffee is surprisingly good, and I drink it black. The only thing I ever had off the entire menu that I disliked was the huevos rancheros, but I think they've changed the recipe since. The service is always pretty prompt and there's never too long of a wait."}
{"text":"Great food! & the service was on point. Our waitress was so polite & attentive. I got the Day Break & it was a perfect amount of everything & it was delicious. The 3 other individuals I was with said the plates they got were amazing as well. We were all impressed with the food & service. The only reason I took one star off was the cleanliness of the bathroom was not the best so hopefully they will attend to those soon. Otherwise it's a great breakfast joint & I will be returning."}
{"text":"I actually, finally created an account with Yelp just to warn people about Crackers? Firstly, the food wasn't bad. Not great and definitely took forever but quality wise it was okay. The service was ridiculously horrible. The waiter was rude, the Manager lady was terrible, they sure didn't screen employees very well. Could use a complete makeover! Won't return and hope others will take warning.."}
{"text":"Ummm... let's see.. we got a take out order and was missing about 4 items.  So that sucked, especially after specially asking before we left.  
Philly was ok.. fries nothing to brag about.  
Princess omelette was less than par,  eggs were overcooked and not much cream cheese.  
Kids meal was worse than a fast food meal. 
Cinnamon french toast less than the great reviews but they also didn't include syrup so...

I cannot recommend this place based on this order"}
{"text":"If you love French toast and cinnamon rolls, then you MUST try C&CC's Cinnamon French toast.  Be sure to have all your life affairs in order, bec. once you've finished your plate, you'll be happy enough to leave this Earth and on your way to a higher state of existence :)  The carrot cake and blackberry bread pudding are pretty heavenly, too.

The ambience is so cozy.  Victorian and country-cottage all at once.  So adorable.  A great place to take visiting relatives and friends to, serving up great food and a welcoming atmosphere.

Check out their menus online... breakfast and lunch specials change daily."}
{"text":"This place is worth all of the hype for sure. It was busy on a Saturday morning but we were seated immediately and our server Brian was so nice and took great care of us. Even hooked up an iced coffee which they don't technically serve there. I had the breakfast sandwich and my fiancé has the spinach omelette. Over all we were really impressed, enjoyed the food and were in and out quickly!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Crackers and Co. for years.  The service and food are usually very good.  Not today.  Service was slow, they were very under staffed for a Saturday ( I have noticed this the last few Saturday's I have been there).  I got the special Carnitas Chiliqullies.   I normally get their Carnitas Skillet.  The Carnitas was good but everything else was off.   The refried beans were room temp with an off taste.  The ice tea was also bad we asked to replace It with a small milk.  When the bill came it still had the ice tea on it, we told our server and he just shrugged his shoulders and took our payment.  We will not be back for a long while."}
{"text":"I love this place! The green chili skillet is my favorite and you can substitute buttermilk pancakes for a small up charge instead of toast."}
{"text":"Breakfast was GREAT!!  Service was EXCELLENT!!  Peach pancakes were very good!! Good place to meet with family and friends!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times this place has been amazing. The first time was a few years years ago when I went and had a quiet breakfast by myself. Since then I've wanted to take my wife there. We went on a weekend late morning and it was very busy, luckily since it was just 2 of us we were seated right away.

This visit I had the French toast, which was AMAZING. Omg, the slices were ginormous, and their batter is magical. So filling I couldn't even finish half of it.

My wife had the Turkey Bacon Melt, which she really liked. The flavouring in the mayo was very subtle, which made her pickiness very happy. 

Service was excellent, the bathrooms were nice and clean. This is definitely in my top 5 breakfast places."}
{"text":"Ok. Sunday AM. Got seated quickly. many many people waiting, with many table vacant. So, first clue that management sucks. Sat almost 20 min. No server the server who waited on the adjacent table took 10 min to deliver water and coffee. Still didn't stop to serve us. I just left. Never got served...and.numerous tables were vacant with a dozen still waiting. Maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I have been to Crackers various times for breakfast and as always it is fantastic. Weekends are busy but the wait is never too long. I love the Eggs Benny and my daughter adores the Berry Blintzes. The muffins are also so moist and they melt on your tongue. The bacon is thick and perfectly cooked.  The breakfast sandwich is another mouth watering breakfast offering.
 Lunch however was disappointing. My lunch companion and I ordered the Spinach Artichoke soup which was the consistency of paste and should have been served with Chips for dipping.
 I ordered the Poblano Chicken Melt,  w Pepper jack cheese and a garlic mayo.  Disappointing was the flavor of the chicken breast as there was none. It didn't even taste salt and peppered. The garlic mayo was minimal and lastly the charring on the Poblano pepper was over powering and bitter. The bun however was fresh and the only item I somewhat enjoyed. Breakfast is definately Crackers strong suit and I will be back for that. But sorry  lunch is a no go"}
{"text":"I try to support local small business whenever I can and living in Mesa makes it tough - it is chain restaurant heaven. We drive out of our way to get to Crackers & Co - service is always good, quick, food is dependable and good. The Two, Two Two is the best mix of all breakfast choices out there.   Local and dependable, pretty much all I'm looking for at breakfast.  Not sure why all the haters."}
{"text":"Fix the fucking nasty ass water. I love the food, but I can't stand not being able to drink anything while Im here. The tea, the coffee, the water all taste like mildew. I thought maybe it was a one tine thing but no, its like this EVERY TIME! I will not be returning until I see reviews on how they fixed the water.



.....the water is fixed... 4 stars ;)"}
{"text":"I'm honestly torn. Went here once with my mother and the food was awesome. Went here once with my family and was underwhelmed. The third time was really disappointed. The first time I got the eggs Benedict. Second time was the eggs Benedict again but this time the whites were super runny to the point I didn't feel comfortable eating them. I ended up sending them back. The third time both my husband and myself got the princess omelet. There was something about the seasoning that was really unappealing. I think they must have used smoked pepprika or chipotle? The color of the hollandaise was colored by it and there smokey flavor was over powering. Meanwhile eggs in the omelet were over cooked. We both ended up with upset stomachs. On the other hand the pancakes my kids gave gotten each time have been consistently delicious. They have always been so fluffy and rich. I'm thinking maybe next time (if there is a next time) we'll skip the egg dishes and stick with the pancakes."}
{"text":"I Love, Love, (Let me repeat it once more for effect) LOVE this place. 
I was invited out to brunch with a few people and was unsure about this place, it was kinda hidden behind the home depot...in fact I missed it the first time I went there. Being a vegetarian I looked at the menu and noted almost everything had meat...which may be my only small issue with the place..the lunch is pretty meat based. HOWEVER!!! one beautifully glow point...they will take it out, make exceptions and add things with no issue. Once they came out with it wrong, it was taken off my bill, immediately fixed, apologized for and I have never had any issue with service. Actually, haha I've been in several time but my last visit was in August(Which this is where I demanded breakfast/lunch on my birthday). I walked in Saturday at 12:10, told them I needed to be out by 12:30 and they were incredibly accommodating. Made sure I was seated where I could read (I went alone) and the food was out by 12:20, so I had enough time to eat, pay and leave. Also the waitress thought ahead and brought my drink in a to go cup. The (I believe) manager Kat remembered me from August! Execellent customer service, Excellent Food and to the person who complained about prices...have you been to IHOP/Dennys Or Village Inn lately? Crackers is on the same level if not somewhat cheaper for some things. P.S. Try the tea & Bread Pudding! Its great and my vegetarian friends don't be afraid to tell them to subtract the meats.
I always get the New Hampshire Skillet - No Meat, add in tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms and it comes with broccoli. YUM!

{"text":"We have been to Cracker's and Company many times for breakfast and lunch and always enjoyed it.  Our friends agreed and somehow we ended up going with two sets of friends in just a few days.  Everyone was happy with the service and the food.  We expect to be back more when back in town."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I will go back soon. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We have found our breakfast spot! The service is always good and the wait hasn't been long to get a seat. We have started coming here about once every week or two. Have yet to be disappointed with anything that I have ordered."}
{"text":"My husband (the pickiest guy in the world!) has been taking co-workers and employees to Crackers & Co. every Friday for breakfast for years, so you know it's special.  Not a big breakfast eater myself, Crackers & Co. has been my favorite for lunch as long as I can remember.  I usually hit the newest location on the northeast corner of Greenfield and Brown in Mesa.

Everything I have ever tried there has been perfection.  Their homemade soups are fantastic, as are the many and varied sandwiches and salads.  I always have to restrain myself from eating too much because I just could not leave there without ordering their specialty:  blackberry bread pudding.  Crackers has won accolades over the years for this desset.  From the sound of it (and due to the lack of chocolate), it didn't sound like anything special to me; that is, until a friend made me try it.  The combination of the warm, soft bread, the sweet blackberries, the yummy rum sauce, and the fantastic whipped cream create an incredible sensory experience.  Anyone with a sweet tooth has to try this dessert.  

The warm, inviting atmosphere, plus the delicious food makes Crackers & Co. one of the Valley's best restaurants."}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing, the food was wonderful, they were great with my toddler child, the price was reasonable! We had the Crab Eggs Benedict and the Country Fried Steak Biscuits and Gravy. My parents loved their food as well and it was a fun time for all! I would highly recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My son and I were in Mesa for a classic car auction. We ate here 3 mornings while we were there. The food was great. I ordered something different every day. Everything was very good.. The amount of food we got was almost more then we could eat. The staff was friendly we could not asked for better service. Wish we had this restaurant closer to home."}
{"text":"Deliciously consistent. Everything tastes freshly baked. I just love this place.

I'm usually at the location in Tempe, but this was a nice change of pace, less crowded but still very personable and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Superb breakfast.  Best French toast I've had in some time- perfectly made and delicious.  They have good southwestern breakfasts too, like the Spicy Mexican skillet and pork carnitas skillet.  Will definitely be coming here again when I'm looking for a good place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts with large portion sizes.  Their skillets and French toast are some of my favorites.  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was really good and was seated really quickly. Not a fan of the sugar walnut topping for pancakes. Food took about 15 minutes to come out after ordering and part of the meal was missing however it was corrected pretty quickly. The beggars omelet and the farmers skillet (minus mushrooms on both) was really good. Over really good experience would recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is small, but crowded. I could see how waits could get long as other reviews stated. However, it was Sunday brunch time and we got right in as a party of two. The portions are HUGE and very tasty. We had the cinnamon swirl French toast and Breakfast \"222\". When the waitress said the French toast was a large portion, we were expecting Texas toast sized... She said, no, we use monster bread here lol. Anyways they are hand dipped and grilled, then topped with more cinnamon and honey butter. Yum! The other breakfast was two scrambled eggs, two delicious strips of thick cut bacon, and two gigantic pancakes. Even the pancakes were super thick and fluffy. I'll be back to try other items.... The California eggs Benedict looked good and German chocolate bread pudding? Omg sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Crackers & Co. I've only been there a couple times, but I can't wait to go back! This particular location gets a star knocked off for management. Maybe it was early in the morning before a holiday rush, or whatever the excuse, but another group was treated so awful over their reservation. However, once inside everything seemed to run smoothly. Service was great and so was my omelette. :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!  I had the proscuitto eggs benedict.  The eggs were poached to perfection and the breakfast potatoes were good (but not great)...the grand finale --- carrot cake --- which was pretty disappointing...

Food and service was pretty good for a Saturday morning...which I hear, gets pretty busy...

Will come here again when we visit AZ."}
{"text":"This place is in such a weird locations but we've been going here since I was young. Their French toast with strawberries and whip is so delicious and huge! But probably my very favorite thing is the blackberry bread pudding. It's insane and has ruined bread pudding anywhere else for me! I get it for breakfast all the time. Haha! Mmm now I want that. The 4 star is because the decor is just so so terrible. Like I often don't recommend this place to people asking for breakfast/brunch Recs because the atmosphere is so ugly. Wish they'd get a makeover!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday on our way to the Mesa waterpark. We love breakfast and this place definitely met our expectations. They had a big menu with lots to choose from. My boyfriend got the breakfast burritos and he loved it. I had the biscuits and gravy. We were very pleased and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The 1st few visits were great. It became my favorite place for breakfast. However the service started going down in my opinion. One visit,mine waitress lost my debit card. After looking for it for approx 20 minutes, the manager came to our table and explained they couldn't find my card. After leaving and arriving home in Chandler, they called and said my card was found. It was very frustrating and a waste of part of my day for the inconvience of all the waiting and driving. Then the next visit there was a hair in my food. For now, returning to here is on hold."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting the area for some spring training. I found this hidden spot on yelp the first morning of our trip and it was so delicious that we enjoyed breakfast here every morning of our stay! The skillets were amazing!!! I had the \"Spicy Mexican\" skillet two mornings in a row! My husband said the southwest chorizo carnitas skillet was the best breakfast he has ever had! We will definitely be back next year!"}
{"text":"Amazing French toast with warm syrup. Tried it with chicken tortilla soup fresh and hot. My beau tried day break with sides of breakfast potatoes he just enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"I love this place but keep in mind it is only open for breakfast and lunch!! They have so many good options you can't go wrong. One of my favorites are the granola pancakes for breakfast. And the turkey club for lunch is amazing!! Crackers and Company is the setting for most of my breakfast & lunch birthday outings with friends! And the prices aren't too bad!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. Fast & friendly service! The sandwiches (BLT & Californian) were thick and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast to celebrate my sister's birthday.  Service was nothing special, in fact they seemed a disinterested.  The food was decent but for the price it wasn't anything spectacular.  When it came time to pay we were each given our receipts with the total.  They have a register at the front desk so I figured we take our receipts to the front since the receipts weren't in a discrete book or anything.  The girl at the front said the server usually takes care of payment, even though she wasn't doing anything and was at the register.  Okay, so we all hand the server payment with our receipts (no books) and cross our fingers there is no mix-ups.  

All in all, wouldn't go back while there are so many other places that serve great breakfast with amazing service."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Great sandwiches and soups. Try the thrill of the grill (for chicken lovers), the run of the garden (for veggy eaters) and the excellent tortilla soup as a side. For desert, Crackers has the best blackberry bread pudding anywhere. Wow."}
{"text":"Awrsome as usual!  Waited longer for food inside than did waiting for table but once food came it was delish!"}
{"text":"Run of the mill \"we're open on Sunday and have a huge menu so it's a breakfast\" place. Service is usually good (not great - simply because of how large the place is) but the quality of service and food has gone down.

If you want to stuff your face full of absurdly organized junk/breakfast food and are too classy for ihop; this is your spot."}
{"text":"Food was as good as usual. Crackers still produces a quality product. There soups are devine and my wife really enjoys the French Chick sandwich.   Veronica and Steve have a quality kitchen. 

The service was certainly not what it used to be.  The staff sat at a table right next to us and chatted about all sorts of things while cleaning menus.  Not very professional even though the manager was right there joining in on the conversation with them.    Our waitress was not very attentive at all.  We seemed like we were a little bit o an imposition to her.  

I will definitely not go back to the original any more and will stick to their restaurant on Greenfield.  I recommend you do the same and avoid the one by the Home Depot."}
{"text":"Pros: pretty yummy food
           Good variety 
           Clean environment 
            Nice staff
            Quite 

Cons: the wait on weekend can be long
            Kinda pricey 

I've been to multiple locations of this restaurant, each one has a good variety of food but the taste is different due to having different chefs . I can honestly say we've never been disappointed in the food it has a unique taste but is usually pretty good. Would be five stars if it didn't have such a long wait on the weekends but during the weekdays it's pretty quick to get in."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now since I live close by. My mom and i decided to try this place out for the first time. We came in for breakfast and where seated promptly and our food came out shortly after ordering. After our food came out the waiter disappeared! He NEVER came back to refill our drinks and I actually had to ask the hostess for refills and our check. We did see him at other tables helping out other customers and he did look at us but never physically came over and asked if we needed anything. It wasn't until I got our check the waiter came back to be our \"cashier\".
 I asked for the manger to come so I could speak to him about the horrible service we received. He was nice about it and understood why I was upset about the service and he comped our entire meal and even offered us dessert. If it wasn't for the manager handling the situation properly, I would not be interested in coming back. Hopefully my next experience will be a better one because the food was delicious but the service could have been way better."}
{"text":"The Southwest Eggs Benedict were really good! The service was sort of mixed. The waitress was nice, but our drinks were empty most of the time we were there. Still, every server has an off moment sometimes, and as good as the food was, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars
Service: 3 stars

Coffee was $2.5 and mediocre. Euro crepes were thick and bland. Bacon was over-fried IMO. All that was good was company and ambience. Wouldn't come back unless I had to. If I did come back I'd get some pancakes instead!

The summer hours are 7am-2pm."}
{"text":"Went with a party of five on a Saturday morning, so there was an understandable wait for brunch. Unfortunately, a party of six, that arrived after us, got seated before us. Fortunately, the host rectified the situation once we brought it to his attention, and sat us almost immediately. 

The food is delicious! We split the bread pudding to start, and it is amazing! I especially like how they top it with berries and whipped cream. I got the blitzes for breakfast, and they were sweet and yummy. 

I will definitely come back again. Hopefully the host will remember the waiting list order next time."}
{"text":"This was the first time we had noticed Crackers & Co.  We were out early and decided to give it a try.  The Cafe sits in front of the Costco and close to a strip mall.  We were early.

We were seated right away.  There were many open tables so having to wait for a table wasn't necessary.  Thank goodness for that!

We loved the menu.  There were many choices for breakfast and the prices were very reasonable.  One order was for a cheese omelet.  It wasn't on the menu but other omelets were.  There was no problem getting this ordered.  It was absolutely delicious and covered in cheese.

The other order was for ham steak, two perfectly cooked eggs and hash browns. The piece of ham was half of a dinner ham!!  It wasn't the processed piece that some restaurants serve.   Both orders were very good.  We had no complaints with the food and would definitely return because of the food.

The issue was not the food.  Our issue was with the service.  Coffee cups were totally empty without refills.  Trying to get the attention of our server (Mari) was difficult.  Finally I had to hold my empty cup upside down to get another server to let our server know.  Then, it seemed forever to get that cup filled even after she acknowledged the empty cup.  Why?  That time it was because she was multi-tasking. and we were thinking it was to save her steps.  Our breakfast was up and instead of filling our cups while we continued to wait, she either collected our breakfast, made coffee, poured it in a pitcher or whatever she did, it all arrived to together.  We weren't happy with the service and our tip reflected that."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service here. Upon arrival, we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait yet there were MANY open tables. Actually, the first hostess we encountered didn't even say hi and looked lost. We were only a party of 2. Then 2 parties of 3 came in and immediately were seated. When asked, we were told we had to wait to be seated at a table for 2 incase they had parties of 4. Looking around, they had many tables open. We were seated at guess what....a table for 4. There was no need to wait. Just a hostess being racist. Nobody after us had to wait.  Again, racist hostess. I will be speaking to her manager as this is unacceptable. Server was also a hot mess. He took forever and when he brought our coffee, it is spilling from the mugs all over the floors. We get a half a cup of coffee. I have to ask for napkins to wipe down the cups because they have coffee (not even hot) all over the cups. I wanted to leave but my husband was hungry and wanted to give them a chance however I will probably not return. Hopefully the food will make up for it. It looks amazing so far but first impressions matter."}
{"text":"Well we were pretty certain we were in for a treat after finding this place on yelp and seeing the large volume of wonderful reviews and we weren't disappointed. Nicely decorated, comfortable place with friendly people and awesome food! What more could one want? They were busy when we got there mid-day on a Saturday but we were still seated with just a few minutes wait. Our waiter was great and the food came out lickety-split. It was served hot and it was really really good! Even my kiddo who doesn't ever finish a meal finished her chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"My last review got deemed as a fake, so I'm writing up another review... because I genuinely love this place.

My dad & I used to drive past this place all the time, because it's between my apartment and his house. Then one day (after lots of \"we should stop and eat there sometime\"), we stopped in. Their food is good. We keep coming back on a fairly regular basis.

Their baked potato soup is my hands down favourite. I order it nearly every time we visit... and often find myself craving it at odd hours of the night. It's got the perfect blend of salty and creamy and the potato bits in it are nice and big. It's a good, hearty soup that fills me up every time.

My other favourites here are Thrill of the Grill (though I always order it without the guacamole), Chicken Swiss Melt, and Roast Beef & Provolone.

I've never eaten here for breakfast, because I'm not a big breakfast person... so maybe their breakfast menu is as awful as everybody here is claiming... but I can't see how."}
{"text":"It's good food and also a nice place to go have breakfast. My whole family loves coming here."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday breakfast a few months ago since I took the day off of work and wanted to try someplace new. It wasn't too busy on a Wednesday morning. We were seated once we were ready and I decided on the chicken enchilada omelette and a strawberry lemonade, and my friend got another omelette. Mine was pretty good, though the baja sauce that they top it with was overwhelming. Next time, I'd probably get it on the side or without altogether. The service was good and I certainly wouldn't rule it out for another visit."}
{"text":"So this is a 2.5 mile roundtrip walk from my mother's place. 
In two weeks I had breakfast here 4 times.

Yes, I'm definitely a fan.

The standout is the Cinnamon French Toast, six thick slices of cinnamon bread dipped in vanilla and served with honey butter and maple syrup. I normally prefer savory to sweet but this was wonderfully decadent.

Other breakfast items such as eggs, sausage links and bacon  were very good. The rancho huevos with pork canitas was delicious and a huge portion. Breakfast and lunch in one sitting.

This place gets a good crowd during the week and come weekends it may involve a wait of 10-20 minutes.

For the quality of food and price ($7-12) I say it's worth it."}
{"text":"I would have never known that this place even existed if i wasn't invited out to breakfast this morning after my grueling (but so awesome) bike ride this morning.  It isn't the easiest place to find if you aren't looking for it.

Service was great...everybody was so helpful and friendly. (My cousin asked for her eggs a certain way and they came out watery...and were so pleasant to deal with when she needed them to take it back.) I loved the decor of the restaurant; I thought it was very cute.  

The menu was so diverse, I didn't know what to get.  (I was tempted to get the chocolate chip pancakes that were only offered on the kiddie menu...but I knew better...)  I ended up getting the Spinach and Mushroom omelette that was also filled with cheese and bacon.  (I got it minus onions...yuck!  I am thinking about opening an onionless cafe...)  It was the first time I didn't have to put ketchup on my eggs. They were that good.  The potatoes were awesome.  I also opted for pancakes instead of toast...and that was the only thing that I was disappointed in.  (Sorry Sarah G...) They were hard!  A little too well done for my taste.  But I won't hold it against them.

I will definitely be back to try more breakfast and their yummy sounding desserts."}
{"text":"We had just gotten into town after an early morning flight, and were in search of sustenance. I wanted pancakes and the boyfriend wanted something savory, so this place fit the bill. It was about 7:30am on a Saturday and they weren't too busy. 

I ordered the egg whites with chicken and veggies (I can't remember the name) and a side of Butterfinger pancakes. It was yummy, but I wish the candy had been cooked into the pancakes. It was all on top of the first one, so the second one was without candy, and on its own, it was kinda meh. The eggs were quite good and came with a cup of fresh fruit. 

My boyfriend ordered a southwestern chorizo carnitas skillet and did not stop raving about it. He tried his best to finish it, but couldn't quite manage. 

By the time we left, the place was filling up. I suspect it's the type of brunch place that has a wait between 9-12. Overall, tasty.  Enjoyable. Not spectacular, but worth a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Yet another gem found due to good yelp scores. This place looked fancy but was still easy on the wallet. Food was too notch and portions were generous. Big place with lots of tables so didn't have to wait long for a table.  Lots of tempting items on the menu so it was hard to decide. I ended up with a spicy Mexican skillet with chorizo. Some of the best chorizo I've had. I'd come back here next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"What can I say?! Crackers is by far our favorite place for breakfast. We have been here a couple dozen times and we've never left disappointed. Wonderful service, fantastic food, and a comfortable and cozy atmosphere. The skillets are flavorful, the egg benedicts are perfectly cooked, and if you're craving something sweet try one of their french toast breakfasts. It doesn't get any better than this! I wish I could give it 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this Sunday morning at around 11AM.  There was a decent crowd but they seated the 5 of us in about 5 minutes.  Service was average - he got the job done.  But the food was good, and I am happy to announce that their servings are big enough for a brunch (it's a pet peeve of mine when places serve minute portions).  Two of us got the Euro Crepe Breakfast, which was a little on the smaller side but pretty damn good.  The Country Fried Steak was a Country Fried Steak, nothing out of the ordinary but came in a pretty decent sized serving, and extremely filling, so perfect if you're hungry.  I got the November special - Bandito Omelet.  It was delicious, and packed with flavors.  I highly suggest you switch out the toast for pancakes (which is what I did), and you will be stuffed.  Or have leftovers. Whatever works for you.  Definitely a must-try if you haven't stopped by yet - I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Look for Levi ! Best host , fast and very friendly. Me and My husband ordered the best egg Benedict :)"}
{"text":"Honestly nothing to write home about. Waiter took fivever to come take our order, fivever to bring the check and fivever to pick up the money to pay. Went up to the counter since I saw a register and asked \"soooooo can I pay here?\" Of course, whoever it was at the counter said no. Spent more time waiting than eating. Omelet was nice, but didn't care too much for the potatoes"}
{"text":"I have been on a hunt for a great breakfast place and I finally found Crackers. They have a great breakfast menu from traditional to Mexican and they also offer and awesome lunch menu. The only things I would love to see here are mimosas and longer hours, especially on the weekends, sometimes you crave a sandwich from crackers at 3:30 and you're too late! Other than that, great food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Greeter at the door was just indifferent, not much personality.  Our waitress was very nice, and she is the reason for a two star, not a one.  Food was not good.  French toast on stale bread.  Just didnt sit right.

I wont be back."}
{"text":"When I first came here, I remember walking out thinking my meal and service was really good. That by itself earns Crackers & Co 3 stars. Now that I look back on my meal, I realized that I walked out with really nothing at all. This place didn't have a strong impression on me, let alone leave me with an everlasting need to go back. I'm definitely not dissatisfied, but I would recommend more than several other breakfast places to visitors of Tempe before Crackers.

I had a pretty standard breakfast of french toast (beautifully powdered with sugar), eggs, and bacon and tried several other items, including a steak/potato skillet breakfast and Eggs Benedict. Servings were huge which is a strong plus, but the menu was really large and lacked focus. I think if the place had fewer items on the menu that they did more... I don't know... extravagantly, I'd leave with more of a memory. If I was basing my review solely on South Tempe breakfast places, this place would be a solid 4 but definitely not any higher."}
{"text":"this is a nice little spot hidden right behind home depot, never would have even guessed it was there. pretty good place for breakfast having all the classics you could want and every time i go in there it never seems to be that busy and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable too. you are guaranteed in and out if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Texas and I have to say I'm very impressed with the food here! We came on a Sunday morning and upon arrival the parking lot was packed, and so was the inside, but we were seated right away. (Only a party of 2). The atmosphere was warm and homey, we sat in a corner booth. Our waiter was very nice and gave us plenty of time to order. We ordered the Denver omelet that comes with hash browns and subbed pancakes for the toast. It was wonderful! All the food was hot when we got it, the hash browns were REAL potatoes, sliced very thin. The omelet was huge, definitely big enough to split, and the pancakes were fluffy and delicious; even the syrup was warm! If I lived in Phoenix I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun, quick, family-friendly café with great service, this is the place for you. I walked into the restaurant with my family, went up to the host stand and we were seated within 5 minutes. Once seated at our table, it only took a couple of minutes for our server to assist us. She asked what we would like to drink in a very friendly manner and came back with them promptly. When she did, I asked to get a glass of chocolate milk and of course, she came back with it right away. This has always been an important key factor to a restaurant in my opinion. Servers must be friendly and willing to do anything to satisfy the customer. 

 After a few minutes, she came back to the table and asked if we were ready to order. We were. After she took down what we wanted she left us to continue our conversation. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a croissant with fruit on the side, which was only eight dollars. We also ordered a plate of French toast to share for the table, which only cost seven dollars.

 It did not take long for our food to arrive; 10 minutes at most. My meal looked appetizing to say the least. There was an assortment of pineapple, grapes, strawberries, and blueberries in my fruit cup. It tasted fresh. My bacon was crisped to perfection. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right, not liquid-y, but not burnt either. The croissant was fresh and the cheese melted completely on both halves. The entire taste was utter perfection. The French toast that we shared at the table tasted like a cinnamon roll in French toast form. It looked like cinnamon bread as well. I have never tasted French toast better than this in my entire life.
 
 All around, my experience at Cracker's Café was definitely one that I will be having again. The service was friendly and prompt. More importantly, the food was absolutely impeccable with low prices. If ever in need of a breakfast or lunch stop, this is definitely the go-to place."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING. Waited for 15-20 minutes for a table despite empty tables everywhere. Order was taken and 40 minutes later they brought out our food and BOTH orders were WRONG. Sad."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the East Valley. Crackers is hidden away in an industrial park, but it's worth tracking down. You'll forget that you're parked behind a Home Depot once you get inside.

The staff is professional and friendly, and the wait is usually minimal, even on busy Sunday mornings. This is a fantastic place to take your out of town guests, but please leave your kids at home. They're welcome there, but they annoy me.

I generally order either the breakfast sandwich (canadian bacon, scrambled egg and cheddar on a fresh croissant -- always perfect), or the traditional breakfast, which I transform into Andrea's Personal Breakfast special by making 8 special requests. They'll add pretty much anything to anything (if they have it) and make it any way you want. Amazingly, they rarely get special orders wrong.

The portions are huge, but the quality is good. Fruit is always reliably fresh, and if you like sweet, unhealthy breakfasts, try the french toast. It's more of a dessert than a day-starter.

Lunch is as good as breakfast, though my experience with there lunch is infrequent. The soups are outstanding and a definite must-have for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! The sausages they case themselves, and the country potatoes were delicious!"}
{"text":"Every Sunday at 10! Meet with friends talk laugh and good food! Services grade the food delicious and my friends are amazing!"}
{"text":"The omelet was alright. But entirely too small for over $11. The staff was friendly but it took too long to get my order and I was alone and wasn't there during a busy hour. Def wouldn't be my first choice recommendation for breakfast"}
{"text":"We ate here two breakfasts in a row, mostly because it was the closest option to our hotel room, but the food was good and the service friendly. The cinnamon pancake special was delicious. I ordered it both days. While they cooked their pancakes to perfection, I found the scrambled eggs overdone... on par with hotel buffets, so that was disappointing. I liked that they put a carafe of coffee on your table... a big peeve of mine is when I have my sugar and cream levels balanced in my cup and they swing on by to top it off without even asking. We ordered kids meals on both days and it was only on the second day when they told us those meals came with a cookie and we should grab it up front on the way out. I love cookies, and frequently talk my kids into sharing theirs, ;) so I was bummed to learn we missed out on two cookies the day before. The ambiance is kitschy, dark and cozy. Love that the service was fast and friendly. I'm always appreciative when the servers understand why we want to order our kids' meals almost as soon as we sit down!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast this morning and loved it. It may be our new weekly breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Any place that serves breakfast past \"breakfast time\" gets an immediate gold star from me. That being said, one of my favorite breakfast meals is eggs benedict. Imagine my happiness when going there today for the first time to find they had like 4 or 5 different variations of the traditional Benedict. I chose the Eggs Benny Florentine - english muffin topped with sauteed spinach, grilled tomato slices, grilled turkey, poached eggs and a delicious baja sauce. Mmmmm soooo good. I saw about 20 other things on the menu that I would have loved, but this was a real winner. I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"food was ok, I had breakfast burrito and apple juice, my husband had Belgian waffle. the burrito was ok, I wouldn't say it is delicious, the apple juice taste kind of funky. it made me feel kind of sick in the end. my husband said he likes his waffle. the service wasn't that great, our waitress always said bye bye in the end of her sentences which makes me think that she really wants us to leave...so three stars.."}
{"text":"I took my kids to Crackers & Company for breakfast.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated on a Saturday morning.  It was well worth the wait.  The California Benny is really good.  They serve fresh cut fried potatoes, not frozen hash browns like most places.  The kids had pancakes and those were really good also.  Overall, I'd say this is the best breakfast place I've found in this area.  And, we all ate for under $25."}
{"text":"So I just wanted to share an experience with everyone in hopes that this doesn't happen to you. My family and I want to Crackers Cafe for breakfast and inform the staff of my sons Tree Nut allergy. Our server checked with the manger and we were told that I should know what he can and can't eat and they were unwilling to tell me any allergy information. I asked if the eggs were cooked in the same pan but he said he couldn't tell me or give me any information. I will never be returning there. 

They get one star because I have never had this reaction to my son allergy. Every other restaurant works with allergies how do they refuse too."}
{"text":"Yelp Phoenix has let me down.  Never again will I trust Phoenix locals' opinions of local establishments.

I wanted a really, really good breakfast.  Crackers seemed to have the best overall reviews.

The two slices of bacon were cooked differently.  One was slightly undercooked creating that fatty stringy chewy texture.  The other slice was half fatty stringy chewy and half burnt.  The pancakes were not good enough to finish.  The eggs are much better at IHOP or even Denny's.

The hostess sat us by the kitchen doors.  I prefer not to have people rushing around behind me whilst I eat so I pointed to the opposite corner and asked if we could sit OVER THERE.  She led us to the table next to the other set of kitchen doors.  I was ready to eat and gave up."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this place ever again. Yesterday, I came here for breakfast as me and my husband had a really good experience the first time we came here. So yesterday, my husband casually asked our server if the sever who waited on us the first time was working. I won't mention the server's name out of respect. Let's just call the server John. So, John was our amazing server the first time we came here. Anyway our sever said he wasn't working that day. She asked us why are we looking for John and I told her that John mentioned to us before that the next time we come back, just ask for him as he would like to give us a free cinnamon pancake. Apparently the server promptly brought this information to the manager and the manager came over to our table and told us that John shouldn't have offered the free pancake as servers need the approval of the management first. Frankly, I could care less about the free pancake, the manager can shove it up her behind. I don't think it's necessary for her to inform us as customers what should and shouldn't be approved within their staff. 

As if this wasn't enough, throughout our meal our server that day (She's Filipino by the way) kept coming to our table and told us over and over again not to worry about what the manager said and not to worry as John will not get in trouble. I was like, why should I be worried if John will be in trouble? As far as I'm concerned, John didn't do anything wrong and frankly I don't care! I just want to eat my food and enjoy my breakfast. 

It was just a really horrible experience. It's so much unnecessary drama caused by the manager and the server. I vow never to come back here again. Besides, their food is not all that. IHOP serves better breakfast in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast with a friend after a four mile run.. we were thirsty and starving. The restaurant was busy but not full and we were seated right away.

I ordered the traditional breakfast.. a big plate of food arrived .. 2eggs, ham steak, potatoes & sour dough toast. Some of the potatoes were over cooked hard & crunchy (no bueno)

The food was ok.. Service was ok.. we never got a water refill .. I'd try it again because I live close by"}
{"text":"First vist and loved it!  Fast and friendly service with delicious food.  Large menu with a good variety of items.  I had the Pork Carnitas Skillet - super delicious!!!  My daughter had the breakfast burrito and she loved hers as well.  The crispy breakfast potatoes are amazing!  Very reasonable pricing for the amount of food you get - we both took half of ours home.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was looking to try something new this weekend, with it being Memorial Day and all.  Searched on Yelp, and found this place.  It sounded really interesting and different, which is what I had in mind when I was looking for a new place.

Found the place and its located in a business district.  I thought it was kinda cool cause its in a warehouse type place.  Not your typical resturant location!

The place is decorated fine.  Um, it gave me a greekish feel becuase there was some leaves painted over the hostess area that made me this way, despite it not being a greek resturant.  

I was greeted immediately and sat in the front of the resturant.  It was very early, so I ordered breakfast.  Server was fine, knowledgeable and friendly.  I ordered the French Toast and it was served on cinamon bread.  Holy crap was it tasty!  I ate it really fast and devoured in its delicousness. 

I really enjoyed my experience here.  Its more of a homey feel.  Not your typical trendy breakfast resturant, but delicous enogh to gorge yourself on some pretty good food at some pretty good prices.  

I can see myself taking my mom here.  I noticed a lot of older people here as well, but then again, it was also like 8:30 in the morning on a Sunday, so I guess all the old timers were getting thier breakfast on.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in for afternoon breakfast today.  Very disappointed in the waiter.  He came over and asked if we wanted teas to go. I had a plate full of food.  Very rude.!!! He brought the ticket to pay and I was asking for a refill of water.  We were there a total of 30 minutes.  They weren't even busy.  
Tip to restaurant is let people enjoy there food before rushing to get them out."}
{"text":"So far, the service is good. We have elder with us and we called in to reserve the table. 

Food is great, waitress is very friendly and all orders were correct! Food is delicious, the quality and potion are awesome. If I live in this area, I'd come in every weekend."}
{"text":"i love this place!! the food is flavorful, the menu is unique, the service is above average. it's always crowded, which means fresh food every time. the portions are hefty."}
{"text":"Me and the kids favorite place for Sunday brunch. Feels like home...taste like heaven. If your looking for an amazing breakfast...skip Denny's and IHOP and try this place!"}
{"text":"Finding a nice breakfast spot that isn't IHOP or Denny's used to be fairly difficult. Thankfully, with places like Crackers and Co., a good meal isn't too far away, and they know how to make a good meal. 

Nestled away in a business complex behind a home improvement store, Crackers and Co. is easily missed, which is kind of sad, but apparently that doesn't affect their level of business, as there always seems to be a small crowd outside on the weekends. The staff are busy like bees at what seems to be every moment of the day, but remain warm and friendly. The coffee carafe service is a definite plus, which makes me happy that I can have coffee whenever I want, and makes one less thing for them to worry about. Trust me, I looked, but I don't think there was an unhappy face there on both days that we visited.

Anyway, the food here is darn good. My wife fell in love with their French toast, which was almost too much to handle, but the dish is hot and amazing with some syrup on top, complete with eggs and breakfast meat. I had the pleasure of trying their chicken fried steak one day and their traditional bacon and eggs on another. There's just something about the food that makes you feel good, right up to the point of where you realize that you cleaned the entire plate and now have to be rolled out on a wheelbarrow just to get to your car. Yeah, it's worth the pain.

The reason Crackers and Co. is so good is simply because it's a warm, inviting atmosphere paired up with good, home style cooking that fills your ever expanding gut with happiness."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. The corn beef hashed was the best I've ever had.  Our waitress, Heather, was personable and attentive.... GREAT job Heather!   Will totally eat here again!"}
{"text":"Really. Sitting here 1/2 hour after our reservation time. Girls at front counter continue to break up large party seating opportunities for 2 and 4 tops and ignore reservations. When we asked for an update nothing but attitude. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. Negatives: Potatoes were bland and undercooked, bacon was overcooked. Positives: French toast was yummy and sodas were bubbly. Eggs, well eggs are eggs. They were decent. Went on a Wed morning,and it was not too busy. Still, our server was not around so I had to steal kethup and hot sauce from a neighboring table. Not a fan of that move, but you gotta do what you gotta do. We won't be back, since it's not worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"Met here with group of girls from work. I had the California eggs Benny and it was wonderful. There was an incident at the table and the management team handled it brilliantly. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The food is great, we love the Breakfast or Lunches. My daughter loves their pancakes. And they have some good heart healthy options as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I have been here several times for breakfast and lunch and have never had a bad meal.  My mom and I come here for lunch about twice a month and service has been hit or miss.  Most of the time we have great service.  Our favorite server is Megan.  She is very attentive and has a great attitude.  Occasionally, and only at the lunch hour, we have had a server who seemed more into getting ready to close than serving our table.  Aside from that, I enjoy Crackers & Co and it's one of my favorite breakfast/lunch places.  It's a cute restaurant, close to home, family friendly, and I love the food."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times. I always get one of the eggs benedicts. Huge portions, the service is great and amazing food for the price!"}
{"text":"Ignore the fact that the interior design looks like it hasn't been updated in over a decade, this is my go-to breakfast joint. 

The best way I've found to have breakfast here is to come with a partner or two, order a few plates (California Eggs Benny, Southwest Carnitas, and maybe some Cinnamon Swirl French Toast) and gorge yourself on a little bit of everything.

I've been meaning to try some desserts, but after all that breakfast and a pot of coffee, I don't have the room!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I just got punched in the stomach, service-wise.  After placing an order ahead of time, to eat there (which I was told was fine), I arrived, was told by three different people (manager included) that they made this one exception to have the food made ahead of time and that I should never ask for that again. Please don't chastise the people patronizing your establishment; that's not cool.  

If that was something you couldn't do and really threw a wrench in your kitchen's production, try telling the Filipino hostess to be a little more assertive on the phone and tell me that-that it couldn't be done. It's better than showing up for lunch, and being treated like a fucking pariah (no drinks were offered, we were told several times we didn't have a server because we called ahead). Sorry that, in the interest of a limited lunch break, we try and be expedient and in the process sacrifice a server who can furnish us with drinks/condiments. Man, you guys fucking suck."}
{"text":"Ok. Love crackers. Maybe because it's always great comfort food when I\"m hungover and ready for a hearty breakfast. I've had a few different items there: Onassis Omlet (very good), and another one hollandaise sauce (a little too rich for the morning, but good nonetheless). I've also tried some lunch items. I had the artichoke spinach soup, not really my favorite. It was too rich and thick - more of a dip than a soup. And I had some sort of chicken sandwich, it was good. But I wouldn't eat it again. I guess I mainly Like this place for their breakfast. It's delicious. My roommates and I crave it on the weekends and they have great specials too."}
{"text":"The food has always been good, but the atmosphere is challenging.  Cement floors with stone arches and plaster walls with wood ceilings allows any sound to reverberate aggressively.  Couple that with a busy kitchen and an overly boisterous wait staff and the decibel meter registered a healthy 90!  If you're after a quiet intimate experience, bring some ear plugs!!!   See our decibel meter in photos for evidence!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped here after church for lunch.  Found it only because it was in the same parking lot as Guitar Center.

It is a cute little place.  Staff is friendly, food was good.  My ham and swiss had that \"fresh\" taste that only comes with good lettuce, cheese, and great thin-sliced ham.  Hubby liked his pork sandwich.

Only reason it isn't a four-star is he paid $3 for a lemonade that didn't come with free refills, and my regular lemonade didn't either.

I am sure we will be back.  Next time we will opt for tea or soda though!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! So many options made it hard to decide.  I had the waffle with eggs and bacon.  Also added apples... loved the spiced roasted apples! Great flavor."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have become regulars at this location. We usually end up here for Sunday brunch once or twice a month. We both love the breakfast items, and my boyfriend enjoys that they usually get his eggs just right. 

Pros: usually takes reservations, offers monthly specials that are not on the regular menu (two breakfast items, two lunch items), great coffee, friendly staff, manager is clearly involved in making sure the customers are taken care of, good overall service, open to requests and complicated orders.

Cons: it gets *loud* when it's busy, specials aren't always hits (recently, there was a peanut butter & jelly French toast that was pretty overwhelmingly sweet).

I don't know what it's like other days, really, but it's a nice ritual for us on some Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict around. I order the California eggs Benedict -bacon +2 eggs. So. Good."}
{"text":"Normal American breakfast. I do like this location more than the other because their food comes out HOT! There is nothing worse than warm breakfast.  A couple of favorites:

Carnitas Skillet 
Pancakes 
Sausage Links"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! My bf and I arrived and it looked like the line was out the door, but it was only a 10mins wait! I ordered the huevos Ranchero with carnitas and my bf got the spicy baja omelet. Service was super quick and very nice!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast option in Mesa! We ordered the cherry blintz and on omelette. Both were delicious! The iced mocha was good too!"}
{"text":"I went with my daughter to drop off her car to Tempe Honda for maintenance. We had some time to kill and decided to catch some breakfast. My daughter found Crackers on Yelp (she's learning from the best. Hahah). 

We walk in and nothing really stood out to me but a bunch of people outside waiting to be seated. Host was nice and told us that it would be 15 minutes. We got seated in about 15 so that was cool. 

When I try a new breakfast joint I try to find something that they are known for. Anyone can make an omelette so... I tried something off of their September Specials menu. Brown Sugar Banana Cakes with two eggs and bacon. The pancakes actually had slices of bananas cooked inside. I really couldn't taste the brown sugar. So they weren't too sweet which is good for me. Dumping the syrup on these cakes made it pretty good. Not great pancakes. Didn't really stand out but good. I had two scrambled eggs with a couple of strips of bacon. Bacon was thick and pretty good. I also got a side of Corned beef hash. It was okay. Nothing special. 

My daughter was going to order an omelette but I convinced her to figure out if this is a good places or not. Anyone can make an omelette. So she decided to try the Crab Cake Benedict. It came with two crab cakes and some sliced potatoes. I grabbed a bite and it was pretty good. My daughter really liked it. Ate one Crab Cake and gobbled up the potatoes. Took the other Cake for another day. She did say that the Crab Cakes were not even close to when she went to Maryland but this is AZ and she liked it. So it was good. 

The service was pretty good. Our server greeted us right away. Got us our drinks and coffee. Checked up on us and got our food out pretty quickly. So I was cool with that. 

So overall, good food and good service. The atmosphere didn't really stand out to me. Standard breakfast joint. Nothing special. We got out of there in about an hour or so. So perfect timing when our car was fixed. So not bad. Would I come back? Possibly. If I'm around the area but wouldn't go out of my way to get there. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the food was delicious.  A great variety on their menu. I had the roast beef hot sandwich. Yummy! I will definitely be back when in the area. I can't wait to try their breakfast. We went during lunch and only had a short wait even though they were busy. Definitely recommend this place. A new favorite."}
{"text":"The carnitas and chorizo skillet is 4 stars in and of itself.  It's that good.  A little Cholula and it becomes divine.  

I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"It is impossible to over-hype this restaurant!  It is, bar none, the best breakfast food i have ever eaten.  The restaurant is immaculately clean, the wait staff is top notch and takes great pride in their establishment.  Then their is the food!  Fresh ingredients skillfully combined and prepared to make amazing morning fare.  It is so good i went back the very next day after my first visit, and if i hadn't left phoenix that night, i would have gone back again the next morning.   The first day my companion and I split 2 meals, biscuits and gravy and what they called the California Benny.  The biscuits where obviously homemade.  They were buttery and soft like little pillows of heaven.  The sausage gravy was criminally delicious.  If it was socially acceptable, i would have drank that gravy out of a glass.  It was served with two eggs cooked perfectly and their take on breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes were cut like scalloped potatoes but prepared like breakfast potatoes and the high surface to mass ratio gave them a wonderful crispy texture. 
The California Benny was a twist on the traditional Eggs Benedict.  It was an English muffin topped with bacon, spinach, tomatoes, avocado, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  It was more delicious than i could ever have imagined!  the Eggs were again perfectly cooked and all the vegetation was wonderfully fresh and flavorful.  The hollandaise was also amazing.  It was very creamy, smooth and lemony.  At the end of our meal, our waiter had a treat for us because it was our first time.  He brought each of us a small dish of their rum soaked bread pudding.  It was amazing!
When we went back the next day, i again had the biscuits and gravy, somehow resisting the urge to ask for a glass full of gravy, augmented with wonderful rye toast and my companion had cinnamon french toast.  The french toast was soft and wonderful and the biscuits and gravy were just as good as the first time.
This phenomenal food combined with the terrific service could easily be priced above the $20 per person mark and people would willingly pay. However, the owners keep the experience open to everyone and charge a mere pittance for their amazing breakfast food.  Each day we left spending less than $10 per person."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was perfect and their potatoes are better than mom used to cook! Long wait on Sunday morning but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Genorous portions for breakfast. Loved the selection they had, patio setup was nice. Pricing was reasonable."}
{"text":"I rely on Yelp to help on finding me new restaurants to try in and around an unfamiliar area. This was one where it missed the mark. The review for this place was very positive with well over a good amount of people leaving a positive review for this place. 

I was really thrown off when i found this place because it was located in an industrial area. The closes food area near this place is several blocks away. The one good thing was that it would be really hard to not find the sign for this place. Its so big that you could see it from the main street...maybe. 

As soon as i walk in, it was like a i kinda traveled back in time. Its hard to explain, but i guess if you are ever in the area, you may see what i am trying to explain in words. It had that i came to visit my grandmothers house type of feeling, but the cooking was totally different. 

I ordered the special for the month which was a crab cake benedict. It sounds delicious and could have been the perfect breakfast to start the morning. I was looking forward to my breakfast until i tried to cut the egg. In a benedict, the eggs are poached and a little runny. So when you cut/break the egg yolk, you will see the yellow lava flow out. that would be a perfect poached egg. My eggs were perfectly hard poached. no yellow lava, but a yellow stone.  

I just wished the eggs were perfectly or nearly poached for me to enjoy my food. :( 
it was a disappointing morning to start the day."}
{"text":"There was a 30 min wait for three people on a Sunday, and I think that's perfectly reasonable. Once we sat down, magda was our server and was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the California eggs Benedict and it was great! Delicious and filling. Usually I feel like eggs Benedict are small portions so I contemplated ordering a pancake on the side, but I'm glad I didn't, because the portion was just right! I also ordered the coffee and there's something in the coffee that I can't place my finger on. Do you know the crusty part of a Creme brûlée? Well, that's how I described my coffee! I liked it a lot.

There's a lot of choices!"}
{"text":"Lots of options on their menu, friendly staff and big portions.. our waiter kept checking up on us even though it was busy.."}
{"text":"It is such a clean, bright atmosphere and the service was great.  But what is the best was the delicious FOOD.  Pancakes perfect.  Calif. Benedict, perfect, hash browns perfect - not to oily, coffee delicious.  Yum, yum and more YUM.  Can't wait to go back.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Perfectly poached eggs. Super friendly and efficient server. The only negative for me was the price - I don't get why breakfast restaurants in the Valley have gotten so pricey. Despite that, the next time I arrive at Costco before they open (as was the case when I ate here), I will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was fresh and delicious. Service was fast and friendly and the prices are fair.

I especially loved the slight crisp to the edges of the corn tortillas. Great addition to my scramble!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Mesa Arizona for a concert and stopped in for bfast.  Absolutely delicious breakfast.  The chili and cheese hashbrowns with egg were amazing.  Finally a breakfast item that made me say wow.  So glad we braved the heat to drive over here for a quick stops. Well worth it and one of the few places that live up to their Yelp hype."}
{"text":"Have been going to Crackers since the 1980's.  I would say it has run it's course.  The last few times we've had a problem with one thing or another.  Bring food before you get drinks, bread old and too crusty on tuna sandwich and the tortilla soup looked like mud with corn and couldn't even get to the soup because of all the tortilla strips on top.  No more chances from me.  Used to see the owners there all the time, maybe they retired and left kids in charge."}
{"text":"My fav brunch spot! Came here We'd with my sis and Sunday with my hubby and his boss and both times the good and service was exceptional! So glad to have this so close to my home! I ordered the Spicy Mexican skillet and my husband got veggie omelet and French toast! It was sooo good! And the coffee is always great! Love how they give you a small thermos so you can have your own refills while u eat :)"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was amazing! We were here during the week so there was no wait for breakfast."}
{"text":"We just visited this hidden gem. Nice, quaint atmosphere in a corporate, industrial area..but once you walk in..its like a cute Parisian cafe. Loved their Roast Beef, avocado melt...buttery sourdough bread so delish.  Buttermilk pancakes for my little one was fresh and yummy. Nice customer service...just wished our table had more elbow space."}
{"text":"Fluffy buttermilk pancakes with a hint of vanilla and a side of country potatoes, I couldn't resist! This is a really great place for breakfast with friends or to dine alone. Service was superb too."}
{"text":"First time here and we are absolutely in love with their food!!!! Everything is amazing from the food to the service and everything in between! We are sad that we can't eat here every day since we live in NH but this is definitely a spot to come back to!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant is closest to our office so am often dragged here by fellow workers and visitors. 
Atmosphere is good, its generally always busy and service is very friendly and quick. patio is fun to eat out on when weather is cooler.
Bathrooms are clean and overall the place has a good atmosphere.
There appears a large selection on the menu - I find most of the items rather un-inspiring. There is the tendancy to go with large portions rather than quality food. maybe I'm expecting too much, but I'd hope for a few dishes that were a bit more inspired.
My test of a restaurant is what they offer for vegetarians and they fall flat on their face for that. 
Salad dressings are poor, soups are generally too salty and many dishes very heavy.
Have to say most of the folks I go with seem to like the restaurant.
The breakfasts are not bad, but again its volume rather than quality.
Perhaps I'm wishing for too much and should consider it more in terms of a diner style food..."}
{"text":"I forgot to review this place a few weeks back when we went here, but it was pretty good! Apparently, on a holiday Monday late morning, it is THE place to be. The wait wasn't very long, but the place was packed (and they don't even serve booze!!). I tried their Cream of Spinach & Artichoke soup. It was alright, but very, very, very creamy, and you couldn't taste much of the spinach or artichoke. The Southwest Eggs Benedict was much better, although I didn't care much for the Chorizo, I inhaled the rest of the dish. Prices were very reasonable, and service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"All I have to say is go here. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring a stranger, a date, anybody. Any excuse to come come here I go. It's also so good, ordered anything from pancakes, French toast, omelette, crepes, and their eggs benedict. EGGS BENEDICT! Get them! Delicious! And their potatoes are amazing as well. Can't say anything personally about the dessert as I have also been too full to get to it, from what I have seen of it going to other tables it looks just as good as all there food. If there is a wait, wait for it. It's worth the wait. The staff is always nice, and even when they are super busy they are all organized. Quick kitchen all the time, always pleasant experience, the best breakfast place I have found in Arizona. Stop reading my review and just go, you know you want too"}
{"text":"I'll run down the highlights.....

Very nice atmosphere! Great, friendly service. 

Hubby and I sampled the southwest and California Benedicts. Wonderful flavor!!! We split and had one of each. Can't pick a favorite. Breakfast potatoes are amazing and i love the crispy edges. 

My son had the breakfast burrito (huge) and it was delicious 

Other son had the biscuits and gravy. Delicious. (We are from Texas and were impressed). 

So glad we tried this place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in based on yelp reviews and was expecting great food and good service.   Once again yelp was right on. The food was priced great and huge portions.  We had breakfast here and I can say by far one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  
If you're in the area stop in and enjoy.  A little of the main roads in a strip mall type building but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! I had the beer cheese sandwich and it was hella good. Service was excellent!!!!  Great place to come with when u have big parties."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of great customer service and great food . My family and I have been here countless times , it's our go to for Sunday breakfast. We never have to wait long to be seated or for our food to arrive (even when it's busy), which did I mention is so delicious. I have yet to order something that was not tasty. Every month they have new food items that they are feature, this month we tried  the pumpkin spice pancakes ...aaaamaaaazing . The staff is always friendly, always smiling, and always greeting . Thank you guys for not only serving great food but always having great customer service."}
{"text":"I've recently tried this place & I am now obsessed. The California egg Benedict, it's insanely delicious!"}
{"text":"Just ate the California Benny and strawberry banana crepe shared it n o w wish I had my own plate, this has got to be my new favorite, definitely in my top 5"}
{"text":"Carnitas Skillet awesome!! Pancakes awesome!
It's pure awesomeness here. 
Coffee is tasteful and perfect temp. Food is to die for! Nice place and not too crowded. Nice that it's hidden in the back behind Home Depot."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price.  Very tasty stuff.  When I am in the mood for a southwest inspired breakfast I head here.  Sometimes the service is a little slow and forget to bring items like silverware, napkins and coffee refills."}
{"text":"Cracker's & Company has always been a favorite breakfast destination. The food is always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurants. My husband and I came in for a quiet Anniversary breakfast and although the place wasn't terribly crowded, we were seated right next to a table of ill mannered children and their mothers. I would have asked to move but our waitress was missing in action from the start of our visit. Before our waitress went MIA we ordered our drinks and entrees. In the past I have been given a small carafe of coffee but was only given a cup today which was disappointing. I ordered a carrot cake muffin when I ordered my entree and asked to have it served right away with my coffee. I also asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side of my \"New Princess\" omelet but it was spread over the top when it was delivered to my table along with my muffin. So much for enjoying my muffin with my one cup of coffee.  However, the food was wonderful as usual. The service was horrible and the ambiance was equally as poor. I'd hate to see a wonderful restaurant such as Crackers lose their edge in this competitive food service industry. I'm hoping today was a fluke and the service will improve to its previous caliber."}
{"text":"this deserves stars the owners and food are great,especially their bread pudding.
amazing place."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok. I've had better like Biscuits down the road."}
{"text":"not only is the food good, but the staff is awesome too!! there was a bit of a wait when we showed up and I was with my two toddlers. When I said that the toddlers were hungry they went to the kitchen and brought back a BIG bowl of fruit!! Blueberies and strawberries and it helped so much while we waited!! the service was so good!! thanks so much :)"}
{"text":"Our go to for Brunch! Delicious and we are never disappointed. Big fans! Yummy!!!! Everything is great!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! I had the crab cakes eggs Benny! It was delicious crispy crab cakes underneath a great Benedict! My wife had the Denver omelet and she loved it, it was huge! The biscuits and gravy were top notch and the price was great! 

Lots of room in the place, lots of variety when it comes to food. It did take them forever to bring creamer for the coffee, and the check. All in all it was a great experience. They had so many different options to choose from and so many different specials. I'll 110% go back for more!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast or lunch place! The food is incredible- spicy Mexican or pork carnitas skillet are my favorites at breakfast but the sweet stuff is delicious too. Sandwiches, burgers, salads and soups are the best too. If you're really splurging try the blackberry bread pudding- you won't be sorry! There's not many good restaurants up here so this one can get crowded but they take reservations, the food is worth a little wait"}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is delicious especially the country fried steak with biscuits and gravy (my favorite) the staff is cool and service is great"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast and lunch. There is a lot of variety and everything tastes delicious. I come back over and over!"}
{"text":"Well if anyone deserves ZERO STARS HERE WE ARE!  I have been here twice and had ok meals. This time today was my worst dining experience ever. I ordered an omelette and out comes the server with our food and he was the one who noticed a hair on it. Sent back only to return with another pretty looking omelette with a Hair on top!!! I was so appalled. Can you imagine this happening twice ? My friends were about done with their food when I gave then a 3rd chance. This time we were good but my toast was full of butter which isn't what I ordered. Anyway. They were nice to take it off the bill and my fresh food was good even though everyone else on my table was done eating and just watching me. What awful
Luck... I still see that hair in my visual mind. Never coming back here again. Sorry for the bad review but it was a horrid experience."}
{"text":"I was in the area briefly for business, new to the area and I was looking for a place with great food and service. Yelp came to the rescue! The chicken salad special for May is delicious. Large salad with fresh blueberries, strawberries and pineapples. Chicken is tender and nicely grilled. Fresh and soft buttered toasted garlic bread on the side. Yum! Candied walnuts are yummy too. Wow, I would never have found this place.  Thank goodness for Yelp! :)"}
{"text":"Carnitas skillet was slamming. Not too spicy, and a fairly complex flavor profile.service was great, and the setting is very cozy. Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I had Carnitas Melt.  Hubby had Chicken fajita pita (chicken was tasty and moist). Mom had burger with real cheddar and bacon. I also tried both raspberry and passion fruit iced teas (brewed) both really good.  Very filling and worth the money."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot a little off the beaten path in a small industrial park in Mesa near Country Club and US60. I have enjoyed their breakfast several times, but yesterday I tried their BLT on the patio (which I ordered with \"extra bacon\") Fantastic! They also have above average iced tea."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant not too far from South Mountain. They have everything from traditional fare (eggs and toast) to some fancy pants euro crepes! I just had two eggs over easy with a dry english muffin and their potatoes. I liked that their eggs and potatoes weren't all greasy, and the potatoes had spinach (I think) in them, which was a neat little twist. 
If in the area it's a good place to go (but probably not worth driving out of your way)"}
{"text":"I had passed by Crackers many times and had never tried it. Sunday morning we made our way over. It's tucked away in an industrial park. No wonder I never went in. Stepped in for the first time and the place was packed however we were immediately seated. The breakfast and the food was amazing. The service fast and friendly. The manager even made his way over to our table to ask how everything had been. The moral to this story location should never deter you from trying out a place. Sometimes the best finds are in the least obvious places. Bravo Crackers and co."}
{"text":"Food is delicious here. I would have to say that my favorite item is the French toast. My second favorite is the blueberry crepes. Employees are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a couple of co-workers coming back from a meeting.  Were seating almost immediately as we entered the restaurant, and our waitress took our drink order just as quickly.

She returned with our drinks and took our order.  I ordered off the January Specials menu and selected the Laoded Chili Potato Skillet.  This also included two eggs (I had them over hard), and toast (rye toast for me).

The food came out quickly and was hot and delicious.  While this was not my first time here, I always attempted to try something different from the menu.  I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the last few months. Every time both the food and service are great! I recommend having the pork carnitas anything especially with the green sauce. Portions are a good size and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Our visiting families all converged in Mesa for New Years Eve brunch, top notch dishes at good prices...Yummm !"}
{"text":"Heard good things about the cooking and food. went with my mom who highly recommended it.  I ordered cinnamon battered French toast. fresh eggs too. I was impressed. Huge portions and strawberries/whip cream tasted superb. Clean fast service. My mom had Chicken tortilla soup. i tasted and it wa"}
{"text":"We would have written a comment directly to the management but there was no way to do so on their web site.
Today was our first visit and we were initially impressed by the building and the friendly staff; we were very uinhappy with the noise however, (and it was in no way crowded) which was made much worse by a radio station over the loudspeakers! The atmosphere did not need any extra noise, especially by the annoying music of this particular station. When we asked the waitress about it she would have been only too happy to have it turned down, but we were already at the end of the meal. She said it makes it very hard for the wait staff to take orders correctly and attend to the customers.
My husband also said the bathroom could have been cleaner.
The food was good but if we go back it will be to sit outside, or maybe try another localion."}
{"text":"When my friends and I first got here, our server told us they were understaffed & there would be a little bit of a wait. So we ordered a fruit platter to start with just to hold us over. Fruit is always good! It was fresh & their fruit dip was addicting. We didn't anticipate the wait being 45 mins long! As our server came around, he offered us complimentary muffins! So we each got one & shared with each other. We got blueberry, pistachio & carrot! They were all so freaking good!! 

I got the southwest eggs Benedict & man are they good! So fatty & greasy but it hit the spot, for real. & their potatoes are amazing. Nice and crispy. Perfectly seasoned! The portion was decently generous. Overall, It was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few friends.  There was so much to choose from on the menu.  I wanted to try everything.  I ended up ordering the BLT with the loaded potato soup.  Both were phenomenal.  Me and my two friends split the blackberry bread pudding.  It was so yummy.  I wish I had it all to myself.  I will definitely be coming back to try their other menu items!  

Also, the service was great.  Our server Stephanie was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Well.....back again and always awesome!  I feel sorry for people trying to save 3 or 4 bucks to eat dennys instead of having some of the best breakfast in town lol tried the granola and berries pancakes which was great , so much more than I could eat. And I would argue it as the best bacon I have been friends with ha ha ha. Service is always friendly and fast. Can't wait for my next meal here. Money!"}
{"text":"First time coming here.  I arrived at 2:06 to eat breakfast alone and even though Yelp and Google both say the place is open until 2:30 pm apparently they won't let new customers in after 2 because I was told that they were closed. Why have hours if your not going to follow them? If you are looking for something in the early afternoon apparently this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly as it is near the office and everyone in the group can find something they like.  They always serve breakfast, which always look good.  I usually have a salad, I especially like the Chipolte Chicken salad, it has spinach.  The service is usually good, today it was a bit slow.  Mixed reviews from my peers on the Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup, a bit thick, more like a dip.  My friend loved her vegi sandwich today."}
{"text":"Please, please get the Lemon Bar for dessert.  It was so unbelievably good.

Oh, and the breakfast was good too.  Our waitress was fantastic and very helpful and patient with our large party."}
{"text":"Great serves with fast food delivery. This is my second time in here and loved both times. Great morning atmosphere with a clean environment. Came in on a Sunday morning early and it was not overcrowded!"}
{"text":"this was a really cute place. the staff was all friendly. the food was fresh and flavorful. it was a great find!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place, good food. Better than the chains like Dennys, ihop, village inn, etc."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and service. I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. My favorite for breakfast in the area"}
{"text":"This is one of those places we go to for convenience; it's right near the mobility scooter store we use. The food here is acceptable and occasionally includes a decent special. The muffins are usually quite good and the coffee blah. Sadly, the fruit tends to be lacking in quality, and I'm a fruit eater. The ambiance is old people and their grandchildren. The service is appropriate but lacks warmth. In the end, this is a place to get breakfast or lunch when you have to be in that area but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Quite fantastic food with decent service. Had the traditional with bacon, eggs (a bit closer to over hard while I had ordered over medium) and amazing potatoes, great toast, and a great biscuit.

The girlfriend ordered the crab eggs benedict, one of their specials, which was fantastic, except that she found a few pieces of shell, which is a jarring and unpleasant experience in ANY crab dish. 

We finished off with the blackberry cinnamon bread pudding and it nearly killed us with its deliciousness. I was dithering on whether or not we could finish an entire serving, and thus, if we should get it to go or not, and the waiter offered to bring out a sample with the rest to go, which was really perfect and totally appreciated.

Seriously, they say \"award-winning\" and they say it's great, but until you've tried this... you have not had dessert. It. Was. Incredible. 

AJ's also has it on sale if you need a quick fix. Will be returning definitely. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorites.  I love their breakfast entrees, their soup & sandwich lunchtime combos, and their award winning blackberry brandied bread pudding.  That is the best ever!

And if you're dining fantasies include being served by Hugh Jackman, then make sure to ask for Travis' section.  Yeah, he's a little shorter than Wolverine, but he looks and sounds strikingly similar."}
{"text":"This placed whelmed me.  My meal was tasty and good enough to start my day.  Nothing above or below good enough. 
I only saw one table drinking coffee around me.  On a cold day, that can only mean your coffee sucks.  So I opted for hot cooca to warm me up.  It tasted like Swiss Miss minus the funky marshmallows.  It warmed me up so it did it's job.
I ordered the Belgian waffle sandwich, which is not a sandwich.  It's a waffle with 2 eggs and 2 bacon on the side.  I cannot complain about my bacon or scrambled eggs.  They were tasty.  My Belgian waffle came with strawberries, at a small extra charge.  It was good.  It was a little crispier than I prefer.  I like a soft fluffy waffle and it was only that deep in the center.  It would have been amazing if taken out of the griddle about 30 seconds earlier.  
My date ordered the Vatican skillet with biscuits and gravy.  It looked like a pile of potatoes covered by two eggs.  He said there was sausage and some other stuff in there, but I didn't see it.  I took a bite of his biscuits and gravy and the gravy tasted gritty.  Like gravy from a mix or with too much flour tastes gritty.
The service was prompt and polite.  The decor was nice.  Looks like a model home inside.  It was cozy and unmemorable... just like when I cook at home, but someone else got the tip."}
{"text":"I need to rate 2.5 stars for this one. I've only been here once, but I have difficulty understanding the enthusiasm for this place. We had a pretty long wait for a table and again waiting for the food to arrive. I ordered the eggs benedict (and I see that many people loved them on yelp) but was not thrilled for the price. 

The prices are a bit higher than they should be, but I guess if they've got a long line of fans waiting to get in, they can charge what they want. I wish them luck, but I think I'll probably head elsewhere next time. No hate, but not much love either."}
{"text":"1st time here- and I'm pleasantly surprised!
Not your boring old menu. Nicely decorated, and very good service.
Both breakfast specials looked great. I picked the chilaquilas.
Xlnt choice.
Home made salsa delicious!
I will for sure be back-this is now my new \"go to\" for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I found it on yelp, drove past it many times and never even noticed it. Go figure. Anywho, after reading some of the reviews thought we would give it a try. We're used to brunch in central Phoenix so this place was a little more casual. It was a nice overcast day so we sat outside. When we walked in we were seated fast. The waiter (Heath) was very kind. He was very efficient and quick. 

For starters we ordered the big cinnamon roll. Um...it was medium sized to me but I'm used to the one they serve at St. Francis. However it was very tasty! They put too much frosting on it but it was easy to wipe off with a fork. Yup the cinnamon roll is a winner! I had the farmers scramble. It was way bigger than I thought it would be, probably because it was 85% potatoes. Don't get me wrong it was good but barley any meat, spinach, mushroom or even eggs. However it was good. I substituted pancakes instead of toast. The pancakes were good. Not amazing, just alright. The honey butter they put on top is a little bonus. My girlfriend got the \"Thrill of the grill\" sandwich and thinks there was nothing thrilling about this sandwich. She said the bacon was cheap and from my view it looked over cooked. She didn't like it. She did however like the baked potato soup she had on the side. 

The patio experience was nice, mainly because it was a nice day. The tables were spacious and not crowded together so it was very comfortable. The tables are placed right under trees, which made me a little worried that a bird would top my food off with a little \"surprise\" but luckily the worst thing that happened was a leaf falling on the table... Whew! Before leaving the waiter asked if we would like coffee to go, I thought that was really nice :-) he definitely squeezed a little more tip from my pocket with that line. (SMH flattery gets you everywhere with me) 

All in all the place was \"OK\". I wish I could have had a Mimosa or Bellini with my meal but I'll get over it. The place is close to our dwelling and inexpensive. They have a lot on their menu so I think I'll give this place another chance one day. (When I'm on a budget AND not drinking)"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review, I'm not usually one to post something negative, but our experience wasn't great this afternoon and got even worse once we got home... the food and service were both barely acceptable. The person I was with is a vegetarian, they ordered the quesadilla without chicken (She mentioned she was a vegetarian). Unknowingly she ate 1/2 of her meal, boxed up the rest and didn't realize there was meat in it until we got home tonight... 

I myself am not vegetarian, but servers need pay attention and respect the beliefs of their customers. 

Been here twice. No chance there will be a third...."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast! The wait could be a little long sometimes, but worth the wait.  The carnitas skillet is my favorite.  Service is ok, could be better especially the ladies up front, reason why I deducted One star."}
{"text":"I went here because my friend and I were craving some brunch and this place was one of the only places still open within a reasonable distance. We checked Yelp before we went and were happy this place seemed to serve mimosas and bloody Mary's, but when we actually got there, it didn't seem like they had any. The food itself was pretty decent; I had the classic eggs benedict with their potatoes and it wasn't anything spectacular, but it also wasn't terrible either. All in all, I would come back and maybe try something else to see if there's something else that I love. If you're in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing. I went on a weekday so it wasn't busy at all. The staff was very nice. I thought the portion sizes were good too. I thought this place was so good I came back here the next day with my wife. The biscuits I got the second day were very dry though.  I will come back here again someday"}
{"text":"Great small place for breakfast. We sat on the patio but make sure you get a seat by the umbrellas as the sun was intense. Overall food was good."}
{"text":"For a suburban breakfast spot, I am always surprised to find that we get seated right away at Crackers & Co.  You can't get near Black Bear Diner at the same time of day but you can walk right in to Crackers & Co.  It is really a testament to how quickly they churn out food and turn over tables.  

Every time I go I try something different.  While I've only been for breakfast, I am always satisfied with my order.  It comes quickly and tastes great.  While nothing compares to Matt's, this is as good as it gets for this kind of breakfast place.  I would take Crackers & Co over any of the competition any day."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Cracker & Co fare.  If you've been to one then I think you've been to them all.  They don't offer much in the way of imagination but their food is consistent, tasty, and comes out quick.  It's not really worth going to when AZ Bread Co is right down the street but if you are over 80, this might be a place that appeals to you.  It's good...but not anything special."}
{"text":"Went back the other week with my 2 youngest (9 and 11) for some breakfast after dropping off the hubby at work (van's not working). Some kind of waffle was my craving and I didn't want to go to the Waffle House or IHOP or places like that, that morning. I was also inkling for some of their delicious cinnamon roll, so this was totally the go-to place that morning. My kids love that place too and we hadn't been there for awhile so away we went! 

I ended up ordering the Belgian waffle with 2 eggs, bacon, and sausage. What a fluffy, yummy treat! As always, their coffee is so delish so of course I had to order that too! The kiddos had the chocolate chip pancakes with bacon and also the ham and cheese omelet with English muffins. Both had chocolate milk.

This is a place I will always go back to. Love their breakfasts and their sandwiches at lunchtime are a hit too! Thanks, Crackers!"}
{"text":"First visit here last week for breakfast with the in-laws.  Service was great, food was really good & the portions were large. It was pretty busy (Wednesday morning around 7:30), and we were seated upon arrival. 

I ordered the pork carnitas skillet, while hubby had pancakes, eggs & bacon, and the in-laws had the pork carnitas breakfast burrito. It was so much to eat! While I didn't finish my skillet (lots of potatoes!), I did get hub's last piece of bacon--which was wonderful! Was impressed with the large box of teas brought to the table for my selection (all Bigelow, and they do have quite the variety).

Hope to try one of their other dishes on our next visit. Seriously, this place is great!"}
{"text":"I have breakfast with my dad here often, but this is my first time going in a while. I got the cinnamon French toast. I love it because it isn't too sweet and is made with Texas toast  we went at a busy time  so the server seemed overwhelmed. Regardless, she was kind and I really appreciated how she allowed substitutes in our meal since I don't eat pork. I swapped bacon out for avocado."}
{"text":"Crackers and Co is a family favorite spot for breakfast and lunch!! I've always had great service here and have always really enjoyed what I've ordered! My two favorite breakfast items are the new princess omelet and the pork carnitas skillet! I went this morning to Crackers for my birthday with my husband and we both had a wonderful experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time here..location is off the beaten path but great place to eat if you can find it!! Food was served in a very timely manner and was fresh and hot!! Pork carnitas melt was melt -in -your- mouth delicious! White bean chili was delectable as well!  Customer service was excellent! Clean restaurant and food was reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"On the way back home from our \"little\" road trip, we spent the night in Phoenix and found this little breakfast spot the next morning.  Considering that the hotel we choose did not have a breakfast, we needed an alternative and this fit the bill nicely.  I can say Crackers is a great little spot for a fulfilling breakfast.

Service:  4/5

We were seated promptly after arriving at the restaurant.  It was a Friday morning so it was not particularly crowded.  I would say it was about two-thirds full.  On a Saturday or a Sunday, I would imagine it would be a bit more crowded.  Our waitress was fine, although a bit slow when it came to keeping our water glasses full.  My wife and I are not coffee drinkers and so she had water and I had a hot tea.  There was always someone around with a coffee pot, but getting water was a little more tricky.  Other than that, no complaints.

Food:  4/5

I was trying to eat semi-healthy, so I ordered the oatmeal with a bran muffin.  The muffin was served warm and was excellent.  The oatmeal was a good consistency, something I am a bit picky about.  My wife ordered an omelet and was satisfied with the amount of filling in it.  We also shared an order of crepes.  Now I had never had crepes before so I can't compare them to anything I've had before, but they were good... crispy on the edges with fresh blackberries and whipped cream.  Overall, a satisfying, better than average meal.

Overall Impressions:  4/5

Crackers is a comfortable looking cafe.  I'm a little biased against restaurants that don't have booths right now as that is the easiest way for my wife and I to sit with our young son.  It's interesting the kinds of things you notice or care about when you have to account for a baby.  But other than that, the atmosphere at Crackers is very nice and hospitable.

I would definitely say that Crackers is superior to our usual trip to the Waffle House when we are visiting Phoenix.  I enjoy supporting locally owned and operated restaurants over chains whenever I can."}
{"text":"convinced Mr H to try Cracker's and Co Cafe since he also is a breakfast lover. I went with the day break which includes two eggs, bacon, and the yummiest french toast.   Mr H went with the meat lover's omelet and he added spinach, he said it was one of the best omelets he had. 
We got here around 10:30am and we were seated right away. The server was friendly enough and she said to us that she loved the days she worked because she gets to eat there.  The decor is old country style and homey feel, not my style.   The desserts looked very tempting, but we did not get to try this time. Definitely a lovely breakfast spot to add to the breakfast rotation list."}
{"text":"This is a good brunch place - not my first choice but a solid stand in. The decor makes me think of my grandmas house. Never had any issues with the food or staff."}
{"text":"The place exudes a very chainish (Is that even a word? Don't you think it should be? What with all the atrocities committed by chains!) vibe. You would think it's a distant relative of a Macaroni Grill or an Olive Garden. BUT, give this place a chance. I did, and, boy am I glad I did!

Southwestern chorizo skillet it has to be. It's a delicious medley of cheese, salsa, eggs, potatoes and chorizo. There was absolute silence, at the table, until we mopped up the last juicy remains of pork carnitas and tomatillo salsa with the corn tortilla. A perfect 'when the food does all the talking' moment. 

The daily special apple crumble French toast while delicious was a sugar overload, and, the overpowering smell of egg put me off. I could blame my unforgiving sense of smell, but, it's definitely not a repeat order for me.

Service was spot on. Friendly, patient and more importantly, non-intrusive. I say that so often because, I detest nodding in approval incessantly during a meal to a stranger who (let's be real here) couldn't care less about your taste buds having a good time."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago and my omelette was phenomenal omg I loved it!!! I think I got a garden one? Whatever it was was so good I will be back here very soon"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant!  I have been to several other places and tried their eggs benedict, and these are the best!  Everything else always looks really good too, but I can't turn down the Benny's."}
{"text":"This brunch spot has the most amazing eggs benedict I've ever had. The California benedict (I think that's what it's called), has spinach and bacon on it! The potatoes are great too. The entire meal is filling and will leave you full for hours. It's only opened for a few hours and it fills up quickly on the weekend mornings. Service is always friendly and quick, without feeling rushed. Prices are a bit higher than a Dennys, but the quality makes up for that tenfold! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the pork skillet and it was delicious.  Waiter, Bill, was very attentive and did not make me feel rushed. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and it was tough to make a decision. Bill was able to make some good suggestions. I will go back again."}
{"text":"A favorite breakfast place of ours. the foos is fresh, quality of ingredients is high and the staff is always friendly. 
the menu has really good choices, and they do a good job introducing monthly specials which are differt choices outside the traditional menu items.

you can never go wrong picking their frenchtoast or an omlet. I have tried the Vatican, greek and chorizo and have never been disappointed.

great place overall, good quality and good prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for breakfast! I only wish there was an option to get a side of pancakes that wasn't so expensive with my main meal. They also have GF options which is nice too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places to go. The food always tastes delicious and even though there is always a wait, it goes quickly and trust me that it's worth the wait. I've ordered pancakes to breakfast sandwiches, huervos rancheros...never a bad experience and reasonably priced. The chairs are the most uncomfortable thing about the joint, but the tailbone pain is worth it as well."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Super friendly and helpful wait staff.  The food was average breakfast fare...but good. I would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Average at best today. Their pancakes are usually so amazing but today they were undercooked and gooey inside. We didn't bother to say anything because they were so busy, it would have taken another 20 minutes for replacements. I don't think this is a permanent change, more just an aberration. We'll be back again some time."}
{"text":"First time visiting here for breakfast, and it was pretty great.  They had no trouble making my eggs benedict with scrambled eggs instead of poached, and the hollandaise sauce was delicious.  My mom and daughter also enjoyed their breakfasts and the price was reasonable.  Even though we live in the west valley, we'll probably visit for breakfast again sometime."}
{"text":"Went to grab a cup of coffee, which is far and away the best coffee amongst restaurants in the valley. Also had a cinnamon roll which was ok. The service was not great during this visit. About 845a on a Sunday. Took about 15 mins just to get coffee ordered."}
{"text":"Sunday at Noon and we were able to get a table immediately even though it was a packed house.  Friendly waiter, good food, prices are what you'd expect at this type of breakfast joint.  

I ordered a Meat Lover's omelet and added tomatoes, green onions and onions, it comes with a order of potatoes and those were good.  The food came out quickly, but was yummy.  This was my first time at this location but I wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger again if I was in the area and looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"What a knockout place! Great everything. This will be a place we return to again and again."}
{"text":"My family & I were on vacation so I was reviewing the local restaurants in the area for breakfast. I came upon Crackers & Co. & based on the great yelp reviews & menu options, we decided to give it a try. We went there on a Sunday morning so the wait was only about 10-15 minutes for a table. The food came out promptly & the service was good. All of the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant & will definitely return again the next time we visit Arizona."}
{"text":"I live in the west valley and happen to come here with a friend after doing a 5k in Tempe. It was my first time and I loved it. They had a very delicious Southwest Chorizo Carnitas Skillet and it was amazing. I am very picky about places that serve carnitas or chorizo, but I definitely approve of the food here. I just wish I lived closer so that I could come more often."}
{"text":"Although tuff to find if you didn't have gps it was worth the wait. The food was great and service was fast. I will come back for the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Had a decent breakfast here one Saturday when I was visiting friends that lived in the area. We waited about 10 mins for our party of 5 to be seated in a room towards the back. I ordered the country fried steak biscuits & gravy ($8.99). It wasnt bad. It wasnt great. The country fried steak was on top of a large halved biscuit. The biscuit had good flavor and so did the country fried steak. The gravy that topped it all was decent. Scrambled eggs is what I ordered and it was scattered over the gravy. Weird. No putting ketchup on those eggs now... I love country potatoes but the version that came with this breakfast entree wasnt that great. It lacked flavor and the crunchy end pieces I crave. I slathered it in ketchup and something I rarely ever do, add salt. It was disappointing. This dish also comes with your choice of toast. Nice that they have a variety of fruit jelly on the table to choose from to put on your toast. It beats me having to ask for strawberry jam specifically.

Service was also a little slow. Granted they were busy but it took a while for us to get our food after we finally ordered. It was Saturday morning, I get it. But if more than 1 of us at the table is asking why it's taking so long then there is an issue. We are not impatient diners at all. It was just breakfast food. It shouldnt take that long.

So in conclusion Crackers & Co. is a decent place to get breakfast or lunch. There were things I liked and there were things I thought could be better. Would I go back & try it again? Yes, I would. I'll update my review once I do.

ps - my nephew got the california eggs benny. he liked it a lot. it looked really good."}
{"text":"Food is super bland and terrible quality! How did they get 4.5 stars??? The style of the restaurant is weird and I felt so out of place. It is an old folks meet up style restaurant, and outside of a hotel. The service was just as blade as the food. I ordered the French toast with sausage and 2 eggs over hard... I got half cooked French toast, 2 pieces of bacon and scrambled eggs?? Really? Didn't you write my order down? For the price I would expect much better quality. Thumbs down and will never go back or refer this place."}
{"text":"The best service in town! The food is always fresh and good! My go to breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here at about 10 am on a Sunday (right before we were heading out of town back home to California) and granted, it wasn't the perfect time to come to breakfast. They were super packed and had a line out the door!! However, we left our name and hung out with the rest of the people and before long (about 20 minutes) we were seated.

The waitstaff was all courteous and efficient. There was some difficulty with the kitchen putting up our food in a timely manner but the waitress quickly fixed that. They were extremely helpful with our child (we had a four year old) who was being a bit picky with his breakfast. They replaced his egg with a scrambled egg at no charge and we greatly appreciated it!  Kids!

I got the 2 egg traditional breakfast with sausage (they were delicious!!) and my guy got the berry blintzes or crepes, I can't remember which they were. Looked like dessert to me!! Everything was delicious and served at the right temperature. They keep a variety of creamer for your coffee on the table as well as jams (I tried the blackberry!) Another great perk here is they leave a pitcher of hot coffee on the table for you so you don't have to beg for a refill, it worked out perfectly and we each had three cups of coffee in quick succession with NO waiting. Loved it!

All in all, a fantastic breakfast place that we will for sure go back to. The food, service, and ambiance were all perfect. Try it today!!"}
{"text":"I left this place feeling extremely unimpressed.

I had the \"Spicy Mexican Skillet\".  It wasn't spicy, or even good.  It was very bland, very boring, and very lacking all around.  Food sucked and our waitress took forever to take our order and when she did she reeked of smoke.  So instead of serving us, she was out back having a cig.  At least wash your hands and pop a mint when you're done so my nose isn't filled with stale smoke.  Prices were high, food sucked.  I also felt the interior seating was very lackluster.  Had a cafeteria feel to it, not cozy at all."}
{"text":"THE BEST TORTILLA SOUP EVER. OH I'm drooling just thinking about it now.  Every time I went to Arizona I hate here everyday. Their deserts are also very good but the salads and soups are the best.

The only thing I didn't like here was the mexican food. For some reason all of the mexican food was nasty and very plain tasting."}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place! Food items are a little on the pricey side but everything has very large proportions and the food is delicious!!! Always plan some time ahead because I have never gone without a wait time in front of me, no matter what time I have gone. It's just a popular place and for good reasons! I have been at least 10 times and will return again!!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast yesterday, and it was a solid place for breakfast. It was about 9:30 am on  sunday, and there was no wait! Awesome!!! I don't think I have experienced that anywhere but at Waffle House. We were seated and got some coffee (which was pretty good tasting, but turned out to be $2.70 a cup..... seriously?!?! that's like a latte..... not good). I ordered the veggie omelet and the BF got pancakes and bacon. The omelet was ok, nothing too special, but fine. The potatoes that came with it, however, were very tasty. They had lots of seasoning and onions.... it was super good! The portion size was large, which I kind of don't like because I feel like it promotes waste.... Who really eats a 3 egg omelet and a whole potato of hashbrowns and toast.... but I guess that's the standard, I just wish there was an option to get a 2 egg omelet or something (ok off my soapbox). The pancakes were also huge, it was three giant pancakes and the side of bacon was 4-5 strips (also way too much food). The pancakes were pretty standard, they didn't taste good, but not bad, just kind of bland. I might come back here due to the lack of wait alone, but I would probably order something different next time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I love the food. They have good sized portions for the amount you pay. The skillets are my favorite thing. They also have specials that seem to be good. The pancakes are just ok, nothing to brag about.

If you're big on customer service, don't set your expectations high here. I've had the same server both times and there's room for improvement. It seemed as though she lacked proper service training as she slammed the plates on our on the table, brought the wrong drink after confirming it a couple times, and she just wasn't overall present. We had to prompt her to bring out our food after having to wait a while. When brought up to management (not to be comp'd but for just overall feedback), we received more excuses than apologizes.

I would be lying if I said I wouldn't go back or wouldn't recommend to others. The potatoes here are better than any breakfast/brunch place I've been to in the valley. I'll just have to manage my expectations and encourage others to do the same."}
{"text":"My wife and make this place our weekend breakfast stop. Great breakfast food. Their beakfast skillets are really good and the french toast is great. I havent had great luck witht eh lunch items, so I tend to stay away from those. Not that they are bad, but nothing to rave about. But, if you want a really good breakfast check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"We've had Bryan as a server a few times and he is always so great! So nice and very attentive! 
Also this place has the best French toast ever."}
{"text":"was in the neighborhood and decided to stop. OMG I'm so glad I did. I food was delicious and well proportioned. the waitress was nice. Lots of choices to choose from. I really need to go back and try the crepes. I have a veggie omelet that was stuff with veggies. I was so full I could hardly drive home1111"}
{"text":"Been there many times. Very busy place. Parking can become difficult at busy times. Meet or bring family friends. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"Crackers is our favorite local spot for breakfast.  There is usually a wait on the weekends but well worth it and they tend to over quote the wait time and seat you sooner. To start, they have delicious coffee which is always a nice way to start the morning. My favorite dish is the California benedict with avocado, spinach and bacon. The ingredients are fresh and theprtion sizes are hearty. I've also tried other dishes such as the cinnamon roll French toast and crepes which were also yummy. I haven't tried their lunch yet but am excited to!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast. I usually get the breakfast burrito which is my favorite. This morning I ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs and ham. the order came with a side of toast and fried potatoes. The food here is always good and I have never been disappointed in the service. This is one of my favorite breakfast stops in Mesa."}
{"text":"Very yummy!!!! The parfait is amazing!!!! Pancakes are great. Egg whites are great! Skillets are awesome! Friendly staff! Takes reservations which is a good thing for the weekend !"}
{"text":"My first time here and it's definitely worth the trip.  Had the spinach mushroom bacon omelet with 2 pancakes.  My only complaint is the way the omelet is made.  Basically scrambled eggs in the form of a half moon with some cheese melted on the top.  I prefer my omelet ingredients wrapped in egg."}
{"text":"Love this joint for breakfast.  Great Eggs Benny.  Great service.  I need to branch out and sample more of the menu, but everything I've seen looks great."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  I prefer the other location on Ironwood, as the acoustics kinda suck here and it gets noisy.  But same good grub.  Portions are generous, prices reasonable, service friendly."}
{"text":"pretty good breakfast spot!  I tried something that was new to their menu and it was chicken and waffles in chorizo gravy served with an egg.  It was filling and delicious.  Customer service was great.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there was a fly that kept bugging me but I guess they can't really control that.  Very good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Cracker's is the breakfast spot to visit.  Not only is the food amazing but the customer service sets it far above the competition."}
{"text":"This place has delicious breakfast and a great variety of options. Everything from banana Nutella crepes to spicy pork chorizo skillets...this place has it all. I have been here about a half a dozen times, and I feel like I've never had to wait to be seated. The girls who work the hostess station work diligently to get everybody fed as soon as possible. You won't be disappointed! However, if you are someone who enjoys Sunday cocktails for brunch, this is not the spot for you. They have mimosas, but they are not worth the price and this restaurant doesn't have a hangout and relax \"brunchy\" vibe. Also, the servers are not as on-point as they should be with the place being as busy as it is, but they get you your food in a timely manner and I suppose that's what matters most. Super yummy breakfast though...give it a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Whenever we drive past the corner of Greenfield and Brown, my husband and I are drawn to Crackers and Co. The food here never disappoints and the service is excellent. This morning we shared country fried steak and granola pancakes. It is so hard to just choose one thing so we order 2 different plates and share. If I had any room I would order the Kaluha brownie, it looks fabulous"}
{"text":"Delicious food, medium service, nice place. Came here and got our food right away, and hot! Awesome biscuits and gravy. Great location. My bro ordered the chilequiles, I think I spelled that correctly, and it was bomb.com. i will definitely be bringing the wife here."}
{"text":"First time here today and everything was great I had the French toast with eggs perfectly cooked and extra large sausage links crispy on the outside moist on the inside We were a group of 10 and everyone was satisfied the family member that took us all there goes for the carnitas breakfast skillet every time I had a taste and it was delish my grandson said he had the best chocolate chip pancakes ever! Great service good food nice atmosphere looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Super tasty and good value for your buck!  The chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and eggs is unbelievable and will put you in the grave from its richness!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, seats could be redone they're ripped up, but otherwise the food was fantastic!! A great hidden gem! Hope you brought your appetite the plates are large."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I was honestly so impressed! We had a wonderful server named Byron who was on top of everything, thoroughly explained the menu, and was super friendly while always checking in on us. I didn't have to ask for a refill once. The euro banana crepes with added strawberries were super yummy and filling, the breakfast burrito was really good as well with the chorizo having a slight kick, and the breakfast sandwich with the croissant was really light and flaky! Definitely coming back and had a great experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this breakfast! And delicious coffee. I don't usually eat out for breakfast because I make a pretty good breakfast and it's gotten so darn expensive but it's well worth the wait and the price."}
{"text":"Crackers and co was so good .this was my first time having biscuits and gravy and my fiance said I was lucky because this was the best he's ever had. The biscuit was so fluffy and the dish was to die for. I'm so happy I found this place its like a hidden gem in a business park. Everything was cooked perfectly, seasonsed perfectly. The staff was extremely welcoming and nice. Really good vibes. I thought it was very affordable as well .I will definitely be coming back for lunch and there deserts looks great"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and is was delicious. I had the California eggs benedict and it was probably one of the best I've ever had. My husband had the pulled pork and chorizo skillet amd he said that was very good too. The service was good. The prices are good. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The only issue was a gray avocado. Otherwise, the carnitas omelette tasted great. The potatoes are shredded, which I personally like. The coffee tasted good, as well. My waitress was also very nice, and the food came out quickly. I'd come back the next time I'm in the area. I will avoid the avocado, though."}
{"text":"Ate at this little restaurant today! Had a Tuna Melt which was the best tuna sandwich I've ever had! Also had the Tortilla soup and it was really good! The restaurant had a great selection for lunch and brunch!  I had the cutest waitress names Tripti, she had great customer service and the cutest laugh! She made some great suggestions and I enjoyed my time at this place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome!  Some really unique items on the menu.  I had the pork carnitas breakfast skillet.

Every part of the skillet was executed perfectly - from the fresh potatoes on bottom to the super tender, moist pork and green sauce all the way to the eggs on top.

I'm only in town for a few days but plan to hit Crackers up again before I leave town for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast Saturday morning with some friends who were in town for our 20 year HS reunion. I had not been to this location yet, only the other two. I was not disappointed. I really don't think they know how to do a bad meal at this restaurant. I had a spinach mushroom omlette, and it was perfect. Service was attentive and fast as well, even with 6 of us. But then again we were all chatting and catching up, so it didn't matter all that much. :-) It also wasn't very busy when we were there at 8am.  Good morning and GREAT food."}
{"text":"Crackers has ample parking in a mini strip mall.  Very open with 50 tables and decorated in a Tuscan theme.  The tablecloths are a tacky plastic that reminds me of my grandmother's house when I was little.  Kids menu is priced well at $5 and they offer Kraft macaroni and cheese to my kids delight.  Here's what we ordered:

California eggs Benedict - Eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise had a light lemon flavor that I look for.  I'm not sure why the hollandaise was so lightly flavored, perhaps theres an opportunity for more butter here.  :)  It was a good light dish but not good enough for me to seek this restaurant out.

Kids menu French toast is the same as cinnamon swirl French toast.  The kids enjoyed the french toast, but it wasn't anything special to me.  It was simply french toast with some cinnamon like everybody does at home.  It was good but that's about it.

Turkey Melt -  This took the show at our table for brunch.  The bread had a perfect crunch, the cheese was melted perfectly.  My only knock on this dish is that it's so heavy, but that's what a melt is!  This is a perfectly executed sandwich.  I suggest pairing it with a salad to balance your meal out.  Good stuff!

All in all, Crackers & Co Cafe is a good option for breakfast.  I strongly recommend coming here if you are nearby, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here.  Well executed kitchen, just lacks pizazz in the food."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!  BEST place to eat hands down!!! I was hoping to find something similar like this in the Bay Area.... anyone know of a spot like this?"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking. I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast. 

They had a great selection of hot tea. The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions. The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy. They also proved that they can really cook eggs well. They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us.

I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING.

The service was super fantastic! I will definitely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"A Saturday morning breakfast at Crackers--or Crack Whores as my uncle and I jokingly and lovingly refer to our favorite breakfast place--is soooo filling.

I also like to order from the lunch menu as well (if we go after 10am)...cream of spinach and artichoke soup!  the drunken chicken sandwich! the spinach salad (with green apples)!

Hidden in an industrial complex off of Country Club in Mesa, Crackers & Co is a great place to meet, a great place to take people, and has a surprisingly mild wait--even at weekend brunch time (the longest I've waited is about 20min...mostly there's no wait at all the farther from noon you get)

Ask for the fries well done and the spicy mayonnaise!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING! I haven't been able to find many places with eggs Benedict and I found many different kinds here and it was amazing. I will for sure be going back there. I recommend this place because the food and service was pretty fantastic and thinking about it makes me want some now :)"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast food!
My girlfriend and I found this place about a year ago and can't get enough. So much so, that we've even decided to travel to further a location just so it didn't seem like we were at this one everyday. Really love this breakfast, but before I just start rambling on and on about nothing like when someone just can't stop typing almost forcing the reader to keep reading like what's gonna happen, is he gonna keep typing and typing about nothing, am I, the reader going to keep reading this nothingness, and even if after all that reading it goes nowhere and jello pudding push karts providing fairy funds for underpriced lodging."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews of the other Mesa Crackers and Co, I went to this one because it's closer to my house. 

I don't know what all the hype is about. I found it to be just about the blandest, most boring, overpriced breakfast I've had in a long time. I got the Vatican which is a skillet with eggs cooked to order, hash browns, red and green bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and bits of bacon along with sausage and cheese all mixed together. I got the cheese on the side and ended up not putting much on. It was about $8.50.

First, the sausage wasn't breakfast sausage, or perhaps it's like no breakfast sausage I've seen. It appeared to be Italian sausage or some rendition. The pieces were big and not my cup of tea at all. I'd have much rather had traditional breakfast sausage. It's clearly the standard, why mess with it? Maybe becuase it's called \"The Vatican\" but still, I wished it was marked on the menu that the sausage was different. I pulled all of them off my plate, I disliked them so much. 

The skillet had no seasoning whatsoever. I'm not a big fan of salt but it tasted like they didn't put any salt on anything, or any seasoning for that matter. I had to salt my food which I never do. Usually I think things are too salty eating out. 

The hashbrowns were pretty good but it's hard to mess that up. Nothing else was tasty. I ended up dumping Cholula over the whole thing which made it more edible. It was relatively greasy for how unflavorful it was. Even the english muffin that came on the side was flat and not very doughy. Most of the wait staff seemed pretty nice but our waitress wasn't all that great and only checked on us once even though she passed every 2 minutes to get to other tables. 

I would not try this place again. Their desserts did look good if you're into that thing."}
{"text":"I enjoy Crackers. I came here because they served Douwe Egbert coffee (my fav). Today, I learned they've changed coffees and are now serving Ridgeline (a Folgers brand). It's ok. Better than the coffee served at Dennys but I'm really disappointed they changed brands. The coffee is the reason I came here. It was my first choice for breakfast because of the coffee. Ahhhhh - big - disappointed - sigh. 

As for the food - it's good... but the coffee WAS exceptional. Now, Crackers is just another joint... Yeah, I'm bummed. (What gave me away...? Hmmmm...) Don't know how long it will take for me to get over it."}
{"text":"Great service, unlimited coffee. I got the Belgian waffles & they were really good. Love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent yelp find.  A hidden gem.  Great atmosphere, nice people and the food, yum!!! :)"}
{"text":"I got the Day Break and upgraded my French Toast to Butterfinger Banana French Toast. If was delicious. Our server, Melissa, did an outstanding job at making sure our orders were right and ensuring we had everything we needed. The wait was long. We ended up waiting for 30 minutes, and as time went by, I could hear the wait time going up into the one hour range. The wait is worth it, try to get there early. The maître d's were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I am shocked that there aren't more breakfast places like this one. The food is delicious, the ambiance was calm and cheery, our waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, all for a good price. A really good find..."}
{"text":"The sandwich was good, not great. I need to try their breakfast food because the plates I saw looked amazing but if you're looking for a good sandwich spot this is not it. Go here for \"breakfast for lunch\" and I think you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Hilarious warehouse location converted into a restaurant with the inside painted like it's trying to be an Olive Garden or possibly a funeral home.  Lots of space & seating inside, and overall service was prompt.  Food was very good, especially the home fries which were cooked well (slightly crispy) which was just right for me.  Omelette is a good size, and pancakes were alright however the syrup was flavorful.  Good portions, good value, and not a pretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Like most American style cafe's
 Homestead country d3cor, good service. Food was good. Nothing stands out, very run of the mill quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"Had the new princess omelet was not was I expected it tasted like something in it was spoiled either the cream cheese or chicken. The coffee was the best coffee I had in years they use a European coffee called douwe egbert. I eat here maybe once a week and the food is usually excellent but not today."}
{"text":"Pork carnitas melt with Jalapeno Mayo! This is by far the most delicious way to eat carnitas that I have found. The southwest chorizo skillet is killer too. And the bread pudding is divine! The service is quick and friendly. The best part is the food quality and taste is consistent, therefore it is never disappointing. They have amazing specials. I really wish they would bring back the chicken and jalapeño waffles with jalapeño gravy. It is hard pressed to get something here that if not delicious!"}
{"text":"Anytime I want a delicious breakfast out in the morning I think of Crackers & Co. I have been coming here for several years and cant get enough of it. I mad another trip here this weekend and got in rather quick, usually there about a 30 min wait. Like always I got great fast service. I usually get the chicken fried steak with gravy but I didn't feel like eating something that heavy. Instead I got the chorizo skillet and I was blown away. Im usually the guy that orders the same thing since in know how its gonna taste and its safe. Im glad I tried this. It became my new favorite. Chorizo was a tad spicy which I absolutely love. That skillet didn't have a chance. 1 thing I can say I was disappointed in was the ratio to chorizo to potato... The potato was the filler but shouldn't be 80% potato and 20% chorizo.. Ill still be back to order again..."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and now I want to stay for lunch. I ordered the biscuit with country fried steak, delicious. Next time I come to Arizona I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Crackers and Co is a cool sit-down place.  My MBA group has class off of 101 and Elliot.  There isn't too much healthy choices, and we had a suggestion to go to crackers.  We had to be back in 1 hour, and the service did a beautiful job getting everything out fast like Pronto service at Olive Garden.

Everyone in my table had everything from sandwiches, gourmet burgers, and salads.  All my teammates enjoyed our meal.  We ended up naming our team name after Crackers.  Crackers will forever have an etched part of my memory!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Saturday. All three people with me ordered chicken fried steak and enjoyed their plates. I ordered the healthy heart scramble with normal eggs, a side of fruit, and replaced the toast with sliced avocado. It was good! I appreciated that there was such a variety of vegetables available. Also, the fruit cup was large and filled with cantaloupe, grapes, and strawberries - easily the best fruit cup I've had at any restaurant. My daughter ordered a cinnamon roll and it was HUGE with tons of frosting. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stuck us in a corner 
Waiter had no time for us
Couldn't even get the water right
Potatoes were hard real Krispie 
Flagged down another waiter 
Then our waiter brought more of the same 
Food had that greasy grill taste 
Maybe will try a lunch 
Used to be a great place"}
{"text":"Honestly the best meal my husband and I have had since moving here. We finally had a kid free few hours and decided to go to brunch at Crackers and Co.  I had the carnitas huevos ranchero and it was so good!The meat is tender and flavorful, and everything else was tasty. The eggs were cooked PERFECTLY over easy, which is something a lot of restaurants tend to make either too hard or the whites are slimy. These were beautifully yolky. My husband had the California eggs benedict and wiped his plate clean. I tried a bite and would have been jealous if my own meal wasn't so good, lol. 

Our waitress was friendly and quick to give us refills. She stopped by a couple of times to make sure we were satisfied.  We're very much looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"My family of five was very pleased with the service to the food. The princess omelet was amazing. It was generously filled with veggies and the sour cream and sauce was a perfect addition."}
{"text":"I love this place food is great some of the servers suck..  We used to go in all the time but don't like dealing with smart A@S servers especially after paying a lot of money."}
{"text":"This place looks like it would be good for breakfast, and it is.  Good portions served in a casual atmosphere. Lunch might be good too, but we were there for breakfast and there was NO wait and we were served right a way.  We will be back so I can take a longer look at the menu!"}
{"text":"So disappointing! How do I begin?

 I went to Crackers and Co. this morning for my sister's baby shower. I know everyone raves about this place and I was excited to have breakfast here. I've eaten there once before in the past, but it had been a few years. I was trying to find something on the menu that wasn't too sugary (I try avoid processed sugar as much as possible), maybe a little on the healthier side, and I saw the \"Health Cakes\" on the menu. The pancakes are described as being \"infused with oatmeal,\" and \"topped with strawberries, blueberries and whip cream.\" They sounded great. I also wanted to add a side of eggs, but the server told me that I should get the 2-2-2 breakfast that already came with eggs and sausage/bacon, and they could substitute those pancakes with the health cakes I wanted. She didn't mention anything else about it costing more, and so I agreed to it and placed my order. 

  When my food arrived I was really suprised at the lack of toppings on my \"health cakes.\" I counted *ONE* strawberry that had been cut into 4 pieces, maybe a tablespoon of mini blueberries, and a teaspoon of granola. The girl two seats down from me got just the health cakes and her pancakes were LOADED with blueberries, strawberries and whip cream, atleast 5 or 6 times the amount on my pancakes. When I took my first bite, I realized that the pancakes were just plain old pancakes, not \"infused with granola\" like they are described on the menu. Infused means \"to fill\" or put into something, so to me, and another lady at our table this came off as false advertising. So all of a sudden, the \"healthy\" pancakes that I planned to eat sans syrup, would need some major syrup due to the lack of toppings. I didn't want to make a big deal of it at my sister's baby shower, so I just poured on the syrup and ate. The pancakes were mushy, and didn't taste like anything. It was like eating sugary mush, and so I stopped after a 4 or 5 bites.

  I ate my eggs, which were nothing special, and the sausage was nasty. I ended up only eating the eggs in entirety and the rest of the pancakes and sausage I offered to family members. My breakfast was far from satisfying, but I didn't want to make a scene.

    When my bill came, I noticed that there was an added charge of $2.32 for the \"health cakes.\"  So apparently that miniscule amount of toppings they sprinkled on my pancakes costs $2.32. I asked my server about this, and she confirmed it. I was blown away! If she would have told me that I was going to be charged $2.32 to \"upgrade\" them to the health cakes, I would have ordered something else. That much for one strawberry, a small amount of mini blueberries, and a pinch of granola? REALLY???

 I paid my bill, and left the restaurant with a headache and a resolve to never eat at Crackers and Co. again."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Menu looks amazing and place is cute as back. However service for a Friday morning was very slow. Husband did not get dipping sauce w his sandwich and my hash browns came after my breakfast had already been served. Other than that staff was nice and food was great. Although having all items served together would have been nicer."}
{"text":"WOW! What a pleasant surprise! I was in the area for work and wanted to stop and grab something for breakfast, something other than your traditional chain restaurants. I was craving something hardy, something with some substance, and not looking for your typical bagel and cream cheese breakfast. I didn't read any reviews on Crackers and Co I just saw the restaurant, the name caught my attention, and I decided to make a move... 
First off, the staff was extremely welcoming (this is huge for me). They greeted me as soon as I walked in the door and made sure I had a menu in front of me within seconds of being seated. Taking a look at the menu, it has a lot of Mexican influence, which was definitely a good thing. After taking a glance over the menu, I went with the waitresses recommendation... the Southwest Chorizo and Carnitas skillet. 

WHOA! This thing was HUGE! It was loaded with potatoes, carnitas (my fave), spicy chorizo, jack cheese, two monster eggs that were cooked over easy, fresh salsa, and a tortilla. Taking a handful of bites of the tortilla with a couple bites of the skillet, I knew I was going to be in trouble and not be able to finish it (and I am a big guy). 

What a great find! I am in the Tempe/Chandler area 2-3x a month and I would MAKE SURE if I am in the area for breakfast, I would stop here... this is definitely one of those places that you come back to because of the good food and a great customer experience. 

Side note, hats off to the management team, there was a small issue with my order and they took care of it immediately!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If my sole measure of this place was their ability to scramble an egg, then they would have failed miserably.  On the other hand, I've long since learned the ability to properly scramble an egg is a lost art in the restaurant business.

Ok, so on the second try I asked for over easy eggs.  They cleared the bar on this one.

Bacon was thick cut and pretty good albeit a little saltier than I prefer.

Fired potatoes were very good.

Waffle was good.  But after all if waffle house can make a decent waffle I'd expect a place like this could too.

Toast was fair at best.  I initially thought I had two full pieces of toast but it turned out to be one thicker piece.  Toast was over cooked, and as the ability to scramble is becoming a lost art, I'm quickly finding that the ability to butter toast properly is going the same way.  Yes...my toast, besides being over cooked, wasn't properly buttered.

Coffee was good.

Maybe my order shows a decided lack of imagination relative to the total scope of the menu here, but I've long since learned that if you can't properly execute the basics you'll never get the tougher stuff right.

I'll give this place another try, but I'm not going above a 3 here."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service.  My team and I visited for an offsite meeting/breakfast.  We had a variety of food: omelet, pancakes, crepes, etc.  Unfortunately the food was so good, we forgot to take pictures.  But everything was really good... all plates were licked clean.  I will definitely be visiting this place again.  And nothing makes a restaurant better than when you have an attentive waitress... coffee cup was always full."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa for the tough mudder and we stayed 4 days and our party of 4 was upset we didn't find this place till the day we were leaving.

The food here is amazing I got the Greek omelette with a side of French toast. The omelette was by far the best omelette I've had the hash browns were so good I contemplated buying another side of them the French toast was perfect!

I could easily talk about the food over and over. We all loved our food and the service was great drinks always full and never Waited long for anything at all our servers name was Chris and he was the best server we had out of all the places we ate at during our stay.

If your in the area YOU NEED TO EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is on top of everything! I came right at 12:00 while the lunch crowd was there and was seated right away (I was by myself). They saw my laptop and told me the wifi password (super fast internet BTW) and within 10 minutes my server brought my drink, took my order, and food was served! I ordered the carnitas skillet which was good! As I sat working and watching the lunch crowd come and go the bussers and hostess cleaned and had the tables refilled in a snap! I don't think I've ever seen a restaurant run so smoothly."}
{"text":"I've been to Crackers several times now, so in reviewing it I will give my overall impression as well as comment on my last visit.

It's hard not to like Crackers, given the menu has a wide variety of items suited to most every palate.  

I find myself ordering the Chicken Enchilada omelet more often than not.  The chicken inside the omelet is so perfectly spiced inside that I always regret it when I DON'T order it.  I think there's one other menu item that uses this chicken, but I have yet to try it.

The muffins are amazing, with the blueberry one being chock full of giant blueberries.  

Even the toast is worth noting, as the homemade raisin toast is a specialty you won't want to miss.

Everyone I've brought seems to love the California Eggs Benny.  I've never tried it since I am not a fan of Hollandaise Sauce or Poached Eggs  and I'd have to make too many substitutions.  

The service is friendly, though on my last visit the waiter was in such a hurry he took down DD's order wrong.  It was not a problem, since she loved her dish anyway and both were the same price.  

We tend to go here with people visiting from out of town or if we have other business in the area.  Do I make regular trips here just because?  Sure.  But personally I don't like to spend a lot of money at breakfast and Crackers is more on the moderate side than inexpensive.

One thing to note, it is often VERY COLD in the dining room.  Bring a sweater if you are temperature sensitive... even in the Summer!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times and both times I have been pretty pleased with what I have ordered.  They serve quality food here, have speedy services, and the prices are pretty easy on the wallet.

The Belgian Waffle Sandwich is pretty good.  I will warn you though, don't order this and expect it to be served like a sandwich.  It's more like a plate with a waffle, bacon, and eggs on the side.  Kind of weird, I just figured if I ordered a sandwich, all the good stuff would be smooshed between the waffle.  That's okay, I quickly remedied and mortified the old people sitting nearby as they watched in horror as I clutched my waffle sandwich like a cavegirl and tore in.  Haha, I love freaking old people out.

I have also had the Three Musketeers Omelet, and this guy is a beast of an egg creation.  It is completely packed with all the good stuff (bacon, sausage, and cheddar) and then it is topped with an overly indulgent, rich hollandaise sauce.  There was no way I was going to finish it, but it was very tasty.

Another good thing about this place is that they have speedy and efficient service here.  They get you your drinks quickly and take your order as soon as you set your menu down.  Then your food will come out so quickly that you will swear the cooks have telepathy.  Definitely a good place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a gem. They recently opened other sites, but this one is the best. Nestled on a small road behind Home Depot, it's a wonderful suburban breakfast nook. 

My favorite meal here is the pork carnitas, and I barely have to wait for a table (don't got at 1030 on a Sunday though, if you don't want to work).

We don't go every weekend anymore, but the wait staff always remembers us and greets us with a smile. We've barely ever had a bad experience here. If you want a southeast breakfast place along the 60, go here!"}
{"text":"Came in and the place was not too full.  Solo as the Mrs was at work and I had a day off to study from med school.  Was sat in the back with 4 of the loudest Moms and their kids as well as some spring training fans from California.  Other than hearing the usual post voting fodder they were a little rude on volume and content of their discussion for a public place.  Had to ask myself, why would you seat a single back here?

Service was solid and the food was good.  The only issue with the food was I ate a Mexican skillet of some kind with a pancake on the side.  Plowed through the skillet and by the end, the butter on the pancake did not melt one bit.  Yeah...it was cold.  It basically ruined an otherwise good meal.

Might come back again, but not soon.  Mostly if we happen to be on that side of town, but not going out of my way."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places for breakfast or lunch.  the food is delicious and the portions are good."}
{"text":"Meh.... totally did not live up to the hype. The food was just OK. Nothing to jump up and alert the world about. Wife got crab cake Benny with regular hollandaise sauce ( what is it with people adding stuff like dill to a perfectly good sauce anyway). I got chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy.

We both had order envy, You know when you try a bite of someone else's food and wish you had ordered that instead... so we switched mid plate. 

Crab cake Benny was a new fangdangled version of eggs benedict. English muffin, crab cake, baby spinach, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. Served with breakfast potatoes. 

Country fried steak with biscuits and gravy was pretty much what it said. A tower consisting of very good biscuit average chicken fried steak, ok sausage gravy and 2 eggs my style(over medium no snot).  Served with breakfast potatoes.  

Breakfast potatoes were potatoes with an identity crisis..  they didn't know if they wanted to be hashbrowns, tater skins, or mashed potatoes. But pretty blah and completely lacking seasoning of NY kind.

Service was pretty slow as well. They brought drinks pretty quick but I swear they had to wait for the boys from the time bandit to catch the crab for those crab cakes. We waited 40 minutes for our food to come out. 

Not sure if I would come back here or not, most likely not."}
{"text":"The food is really awesome. I really enjoyed the California Egg Benedict and my husband had the pumpkin pancake special. Both were delicious. But our server did take a little bit of time to get to us and the place wasn't super busy so it was unnecessary to wait over 7min for water with a lemon. We ordered Lattes off of their Espresso Menu and we were extremely disappointed on the flavor, the size, and the price. The value is just not there for their espresso. It's better to go to Starbucks and order coffee from there than here."}
