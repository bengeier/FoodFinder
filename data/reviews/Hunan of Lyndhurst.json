{"text":"Located in the Greens of Lyndhurst shopping center, nestled in next to a jewelry shop, this easy-to-miss Chinese restaurant was surprisingly delicious.  The staff was friendly but slightly inattentive.  They have honey chicken! OMG! Pictures of that, and of their lovely interior, are on my blog: (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/06/hunan-of-lyndhurst-china-sea.html)"}
{"text":"The wonton soup was good.  The rest of the food lacked any real flavor.  The spicy General Tsao Chicken was not spicy at all.  The house fried rice was bland and really not sure what the meat was in the dish.  Needs huge improvement  on the food and we would gladly come back......but won't be back at this point."}
{"text":"I've been here mostly for carryout in the past and the food is average at best. This place has changed hands a few times over the years and is looking tired. Vinyl tablecloths?  I visited over the holidays for dinner with family and no one was particularly impressed. Our server was overwhelmed and harried and brought one of us the wrong dish. The dishes lacked flavor although the portion sizes were reasonable.   Overall this is very basic Chinese and I have no reason to return other then the occasional late night carryout order."}
{"text":"I've only ever had take-out from this place.  The food is just alright.  It's passable, but nothing special, and not quite as cheap as I'd like it to be.    Sometimes, if you ask enough times, they will actually make the food spicy for you, and then they get three stars.  The food is just too inconsistent, however."}
{"text":"It's been years since I tried this place because there are much better places in the neighborhood.  Tonight I had a taste for Chinese and by mistake I phoned Hunan Lyndgurst instead of the outstanding Hunan East a couple of miles away.  But I placed an order for Phoenix Nest which is supposed to be lightly fried chicken, pineapple, red pepper, baby corns and snow pea pods.  The chicken was overcooked and hard.  The veggies, except for the pea pods, were cut into small pieces.  The pineapple was tasteless and from a can.  The sauce was nearly non-existent.  The nest itself was broken, and the dish was luck warm at best.  It was horrible."}
{"text":"I called in a take out order and ordered crispy fish, their chef special which I have ordered several times in the past, and was told it's not on their menu. After I said I have ordered it before and it is on their menu the person continued to say no it's not a menu item. Disgusted I did not place an order and will not in the future. These people have no idea what is on their menu and are lossing business because of it. Get you act together."}
{"text":"The service is friendly, prompt and the food is more than ample and quite good here. There was a change in ownership a while ago and the current operation is great!"}
{"text":"The take out from here is delicious!  For three people, we usally get 1 order of crab rangoon, 2 egg rolls, 1 order beef lo mein, and 1 order of pork egg foo young.  There is always a lot left over which heats up well the next day.  Hunan of Lyndhurst does a great job providing inspired, fresh and tasty chinese."}
{"text":"I order take out here a couple times per month as I work in the Greens of Lyndhurst plaza. The food is always fresh, hot and ready when I pick it up. The Hot and Sour soup is delicious as is the Hunan Chicken. The d√©cor is a little out dated, but for take out it is great."}
{"text":"Good service for takeout.   Main course chicken was very bad.    Good flavor but tough.   No meat."}
{"text":"wanted to enjoy this place being that it has been around for so long. However i purchased sesame chicken and it was not very flavorful. I also ordered pork lo mein and the meat was gray and the lo mein had no flavor. egg roll was not very good and the soup waa bland. very disappointing."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for lunch but had dinner there last night. We've liked the place in the past but were disappointed this time around. The hot and sour soup was fantastic, with just the right amount of tartness, but our entrees (black pepper chicken and diced chicken in hoisin sauce) were only so-so; the latter dish was notably bland. Our server seemed to find it difficult to manage a smile on her face or in her voice, which made us feel unwelcome. We had heard from a friend that the place has gone downhill, and I'm afraid she may have been right. Our search goes on for an East Side Chinese restaurant that rivals our old favorite in Lakewood, Szechwan Garden."}
{"text":"Great fast service with excellent pepper steak and wonton soup. Great lunch prices"}
