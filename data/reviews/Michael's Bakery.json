{"text":"My favorite bakery in Cleveland!   Trust me, get a Mandel Splinter (the phallic-looking chocolate and marzipan treat). And then compliment this review after! There's nothing quite like it in Cleveland.   Also try the Italian Sub! There's something extra special about their made-to-order, sliced cold cuts on fresh bread! It's simple and a great cheap lunch.  Check the Day Old/Discounted section in the corner first, better grab that Poppy-Seed Roll before I do."}
{"text":"I have been buying their Breads and other delectable pastries since the 1960's. It was very convenient, since I lived just a short distance from the Bakery. Since I moved away from Cleveland in the late 1980's, I have still managed to return whenever I could. I now live a little closer than before (85 miles) and I manage to come whenever I can. The Bread is always fresh and wonderful, (I usually purchase the Light German Rye) but it doesn't last very long, it's that good. My recommendation is: Go there and try it for yourself, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For years had been trying nut roll from various bakeries, never happy...until I found Michael's.  My search ended with theirs and I buy it for me, gifting and Ohio City neighborhood potlucks since I can easily call ahead and my order awaits.  The nut roll is perfect. moist. not too sweet. lots of nuts.  no corners with just a glob of dough.  They also hv torte's that are beautiful for gift giving and just as wonderful and fresh. ..and their sugar cookies that come in colors and shapes for every holiday and season can't be beat.  I've been going to Michael's for a long time and decided to finally write a review to tell readers to stop chasing around and just go their first.  It's right in the front of the WSMkt next to spices.  U'll be glad u did."}
{"text":"Nice little bakery and I love the customer service of the cute little lady with the accent! I just wish they offered oatmeal muffins more often."}
{"text":"Best white cake in Cleveland.  Great hard rolls and bread too.  I love the fresh sandwiches you can buy there.  I'm a third generation shopper here and the quality has never gone down.  Have to get here early, by afternoon they are often sold out of most things.  Beware of the parking lot, it has lots of pot holes and is tiny.  My mom wiped out and landed on her special order cake.  The bakery did give her a smaller cake (all they had) as  a replacement.  A few cars can park on the street in front or on the northside. Then there are a few steep stairs to get in the place.  Its not very big. Just a glass counter that forms an \"L\" with cookies at one end and cold cuts at the bottom of the \"L\".  They also have a stand in the west side market."}
{"text":"I remember coming here with my Grandma when I was young. They're always so friendly. I wish I was little again so I could get the free cookies they'd always throw my way.  I read other reviews that raved about the Miami's and they're spot on. If you haven't checked out Michael's you need to get there early and buy every Miami you can get your hands on. Definitely my favorite bakery. I've had cookies, doughnuts, bread, and whatever else would catch my eye, never once have I been disappointed."}
{"text":"My German great-grandmother, and grandmother, and mother all made apple kuchen during the halcyon days of my youth, each placing it to cool just out of my reach, which could explain so much, but let's leave that to my phalanx of psychiatric professionals.  So when I staggered into Michael's and saw fresh, warm kuchen, right there in the front case, I was a goner.  I asked if they just had a Barcalounger in the back, maybe a quilt, some pajamas... I was planning on staying a good long time.  But I had to scram back to work, so I ordered the Kaiser sandwich.  Since there is no such animal as a \"ham,\" I had ham and Swiss, on a fresh-on-the-inside-crunchy-on-the-outside sesame roll.  One of my grandmas working there sliced the bread, then grabbed a honey ham and sliced that, then grabbed the cheese and sliced that.  Yeah, fresh, home-made, with that hair-in-a-bun-rocking-the-apron Old World Style service.  Neat, efficient, and all for seiben Deutsche marks, ja, as I just had to grab a white chocolate with hazelnut bar.  HAD to.  I'm thankful for the half of my blood that's German, biergartens, all those German cars I drove too fast in that aforementioned youth, Marlene Dietrich, Arthur Shopenhauer, bavarian cream pie, Rainer Maria Rilke, the Westhof knife, Wim Wenders, Weissenborn guitars, Christian Frederick Martin, \"ze lingonberry pancakes,\" the Porsche 550 spyder, and that elusive blonde from the co-ed dorm my freshman year.  Let's call her Ilsa, since it couldn't possibly be Ilsa. THAT one haunts me.  \"Well I've lost my equilibrium and my car keys and my pride, The tattoo parlor's warm, and so I hustle there inside; And the grinding of the buzz-saw, \"What you want that thing to say?\" I says, \"Don't misspell her name, buddy, she's the one that got away.\"  Tom Waits"}
{"text":"Great dessert trays ever..... Brought in to Westpark license Bureau from a company we do fleet work for."}
{"text":"Eastern European deliciousness.  Freshly baked breads, muffins, brownies, donuts, red velvet cake, butter cookies....I could go on and on.  They also have a small deli where they make freshly made deli sub sandwiches.  Prices are very affordable.  I go there when we have a sweet tooth....and I've replaced all of my holiday pastry with Michael's.  Why should I bake when I can give my guests something 10x better!"}
{"text":"I dare you to find a best value for amazing pastries in the greater Cleveland area. Michael's bakery is more than worth the drive if you don't live close by (like I don't). Their pastries are delicious, fresh as it can be and with the perfect balance of sweetness and texture, you could absolutely find them in any European patisserie. An absolute hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My best advice: If you are out this way, stop in and get as many Miami pastries as your arms can possibly carry, put on your sweatpants, and just go nuts.   Seriously, this bakery is out of control delicious. The Miamis of course are heavenly - those are big, chewy, croissant-y, sugary, crispy bricks of pure carby heaven, but so so so worth the be-cankling. It's like the best doughnut you'll ever taste. Even if you don't like sweets, once you taste one of these, you'll start buying them to make sandwiches instead of your normal whole wheat bread.   The doughnuts, bear claws, brownies, cinnamon buns, and Danishes I pick up for work occasionally are all great, and multiple coworkers have said to me that they are the best they've ever had.  Also, everything is very reasonably priced, with most individual pastries well under $1.50/each.  The private off-street parking is an added bonus.  Finally, the people at Michaels are so sweet and friendly - they clearly have pride in their successful family business and are faithful to their traditional recipes.  This would definitely be filed under my \"Six Star Reviews\" folder - it's that good!"}
