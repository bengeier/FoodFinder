{"text":"Completely blown away, incredible food, great selection, fast service, and live blues every night so your meal has an awesome soundtrack to go with it. I will be stopping in every time I drive to Montreal. A must for meat lovers!"}
{"text":"For many years, this is THE stop whenever I drive pass by Montreal back to Toronto. 
Best of everything!!"}
{"text":"The ribs were amazing along with its side of sausage and liver steak. Appreciated the English-french menu. The other type of meat we got was not bad but not what I expect from a smoke house taste, it was called meat plate. While the food itself wasn't bad, the lady at the register was a jerk. She could see it was our first time eating there, we were struggling and yet she just stared with this b**** face. Although it seems they have some plates that would match my taste better, the service made me doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meat with a great outdoors, manly, forest vibe in the wooden cabin of a restaurant. Get the family take-out special with 1 (or additional) pound(s) of soft, juicy, flavorbomb meat,16 oz of coleslaw, 32 oz of pickles, and a whole loaf of rye! Fries are soft and sweet, different but good different.

Much more culture to this place than Schwartz!"}
{"text":"Passed by one day after work to cure my smoked meat craving....Took the platter to go and like it tremendously! Better than the last time I was there and will continue to go back for sure. Girl was very friendly and nice...bring cash or use that dirty ATM they have in there."}
{"text":"We go one smoked meat sandwich and a \"large poutine \" with extra cheese . 
The smoked meat was a little on the pricey side . One side had more meat on it then the other .  it was a noticeable difference . 

The poutine was the biggest rip off of my life 11$ for a \"large\" poutine extra cheese was 4$ . It was so small, the amount of cheese that they put on there should have been the normal amount . The fries where not crispy , drenched in oil...... just not worth it at all . 

They want to charge for everything mayo , pickles,  .... And 2$ for an extra plates!!!! What???!!!!! They might as well start charging for knives and forks! 

We waited 40min ."}
{"text":"Great tasting smoke meat.  But what realy struck me was there fries. Never tasted fries like that Alberta red potatoes and the fry drain and refry technique. Not to mention my son who eats nothing was so quiet I take s look at him and he is racing throu his plate."}
{"text":"I had the smoked meat special with latkas and loved it.  The noise level was a little high but the live band was a blast.  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've tried some smoked meat restaurants in QC. This is the best place! So delicious! I don't live nearby, but it was absolutely worth going!"}
{"text":"We have been  going to Smoke Meat Pete's for the last 12 years en route to ski the Eastern Townships. We ate at Schwartz's last Friday, then at Pete's today. There is no comparison between the two. Pete's is far more flavourful.
I could not believe the number of people lined up to eat at Schwartz's. I guess they go for the history as the restaurant is iconic.
Certainly not for flavour of the food, IMHO."}
{"text":"EDIT: After hearing one too many times that the part of my review that states that there is no athmosphere is unfair I capitulate.  Going to Smoke Meat Pete when they have a live band playing is at much athmosphere as you will ever find in a smoke meat joint anywhere around. 
On another note, they added a covered outdoor terrace almost doubling their seating capacity.
------------------------------
This to me is the best smoke meat  in or around Montreal. Yes, yes even better than Schwartz (and I really like Schwartz). Make sure to order medium or fatty to get full taste.

Ok, the place is not trendy and has no atmosphere whatsoever but their meat is definitely the best in town. Their fries are also awesome and were voted best fries by some newspaper a few years ago.

It's not cheap. It's often packed but definitely worth the wait.

You order at the window in the back of the restaurant and they call out your name when the order is ready and bring you your plates. All the staff is helpful and kind. Seating is mostly picnic style indoors with a few tables outdoors."}
{"text":"Best place for smoked meat and fries in the Montreal area for out money.  On top of that quality live bands.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The smoked meat is good and I'd say the best near Montreal after Schwartz's dropped in quality. They are also cheaper than Schwartz.

I actually prefer to order a stuffed Turkey sandwich or the steak to the smoked meat. They are that tasty.

Their Rib-eye steak was juicy and grilled to perfection with garlic and spices. Better than Schwartz.

The sides: fries, liver, slaw and pickles do not disappoint.

The seating and atmosphere are great. They have live bands on certain days.

Service is very friendly -unlike Schwartz where they feel they are doing you a favor-.

With the increase in Alberta beef prices, smoked meat everywhere has gone up in price but this place remains the tastiest and cheapest in that department. The prices average 10$ in downtown montreal but 8.5 here.

They have some deserts -never tried them- and there's a dairy queen outside and free parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I were both born and raised in Montreal and have tried every smoke meat sandwich available. I've even made my own, but, nothing compares to Pete's. We usually order the \"special\", sandwich, fries and drink. We've also tried the Spare Ribs which come with liver, cole slaw, fries, wiener, pickle, rye bread and butter....just typing this is making me want some. The price is reasonable, the servings are large and the mood is always high in energy, especially when Pete's blues/rock band performs. The only downfall is the line up is out the door, but, once seated you're served very quickly. Worth the 30 minute drive from Montreal!"}
{"text":"Best smoke meat in the city.  I, along with all of my friends who've been there, would agree that it beats all of the well known smoke meat joints downtown.  Every time I come in the meat is cooked to perfection and the fries melt in your mouth.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat ever! Bought two pounds to bring up north to my 84 year old mother. Even she agreed it was the best. Cole slaw was amazing as well. This place ROCKS!! Literally.. There's a band there In the evenings. Not sure of the exact days but worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"Great place for tender, juicy smoke meat!

Parking is adequate and you can choose to dine inside or outside the restaurant. The place can get crowded inside as there are only a few booths and maybe 10 square tables that seat 4 each. A portion of the restaurant is dedicated to a small stage near the entrance where there are live performances in the evening. 

Be sure to order and pay at the cashier first before sitting down or else you'll be waiting for nothing. Menus are on tv screens on the wall which constantly change so be sure to read fast! When your order is ready, the servers usually come out with the food and yell out your name so it's difficult when its crowded and loud. 

The food is great! Would definitely recommend to anyone new or passing by montreal. The smoke meat was flavorful on its own and went well with the bread, mustard and pickle served with it. We also had the smoke meat poutine and it was delicious! Definitely will fill you up and satisfy your smoke meat cravings but still leaving you energized enough to drive home."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat I have ever had. 100% beats any other smoked meat. All their food is great. I've had everything. They have a really good special for takeout. And buy one get one free smoked meat spaghetti on Mondays. They also have live bands play at night which is really nice. It's a good atmosphere. The staff are fast but sometimes not the nicest depending on who you get. But the food is realllly good. Love their picked. And bread. And latkas. And ribs."}
{"text":"Deuxième visite au pete, le smoke meat que l'on retrouve dans cet endroit se distingue des autres restaurants cependant on doit débourser  2$ de supplémentaire si l'on veut de la viande maigre (qui vaut le supplément). L'assiette smoke meat,frites et salade de choux + boisson fontaine coûte 15$ , toutes les sauces ont un supplément de .25 sous à 2$. L'endroit et l'ambiance sont plutôt rustique/western , il a du divertissement le soir (groupe de musique). Le point négatif de cet endroit c'est que le service est très moyen. Ils ne preparent que des commandes à l'avance pour 50$ et plus, payé par carte de crédit autrement tu dois faire la file pour commander et payer préalablement ensuite tu t'asseois et attend qu'on te l'apporte. Si tu le prends pour apporter tu attends pres de la cuisine. A peu pres 20-25 min d'attente par commande. Ensuite tu n'as plus de service c'est un peu comme le mcdonald. Surtout!! Ne fais pas la gaffe d'aller t'asseoir avant de commander car aucune serveuse va prendre la peine de te le dire que tu dois faire la file et commander (j'ai déjà attendu pour rien un bon 30 minutes avant d'allumer). Je donne 5* pour la qualité de la nourriture mais pas plus que 3 pour l'hygiène, la propreté des lieux et le service :-) dommage !"}
{"text":"Forgive me meat gods, for I have terribly sinned. 


As a Montrealer, up-till yesterday, i hadn't ever tried SMP. I guess due to circumstance and life. What a terrible mistake.


Smoke Meat Pete is the best smoked meat sandwich in Montreal bar none. My first time there, during lunch, i was greeted with friendly service and loved the decor of the establishment. I ordered a small smoked meat platter with a drink. Hitting roughly $18 (not cheap for lunch). 

Absolutely delicious.

The medium smoked meat was cooked to perfection. Seasoning on point. What was really noticeable was the actual quality of the meat itself. Not excessively fatty (like abies ). And extremely flavourful. 

All condiments are available openly and freely. 

As a bodybuilder, the amount of food was overwhelming. I couldn't even finish it.


I will be back and back and back again."}
{"text":"One would be a fool not to go here. It is the greatest smoke meat restaurant you will ever find. Very quick service, great staff, amazing food.. like I said, you would be a fool not to go here."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say at all about the food the only down sides to this place are the wait time for the food and the price could be considered on the more expensive side when considering the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, the smoked meat is comparable to what Schwartz's used to be like except portions are small and the price more expensive.  Blues bands seven nights a week, they were just setting up when we were there, but the guy noodling on the stratocaster seemed to have some chops.   Service is friendly but basic.  Cash only.  Picnic seating and tiny but pretty clean washroom."}
{"text":"Expensive and extremely fatty.  Place is overrated.  We prefer Schwartz's.  Ok if you live in the area I suppose."}
{"text":"On my most recent visit, it was very crowded, with a good 45 min wait just to get up to the window. But worth it, yeah. The smoked meat, as I remembered, it indeed the best. It's all in the way it's seasoned I think. The fact that they offer potato latke as an alternative to fries is an added bonus in my book (since I don't like fries.) My only word of warning is while the 'lean' meat here is very lean, the fatty meat is VERY fatty: too fatty IMHO. They give you both (lean on top of fatty, usually) so you can mix it together and it's OK. However, what I'm thinking might be better is just order some lean meat by the lb., and whatever sides and bread you want (bread by the loaf is very cheap here.) That's what I'd do next time."}
{"text":"I had my first Smoked Meat Sandwich at Ben's Deli in 1954 and since that time I have eaten at the best Montreal has to offer and I must say that the Smoked Meat I had last Friday at Pete's was the best. It had the right balance of meat, fat and flavour. The restaurant had the ambiance of a roadhouse with a daily Blues Jam. We bought a couple of 1 lb packs of take home and had a second great meal at home. It was almost as good as at the restaurant . Now that I have found Smoke Meat Pete it will surely be a stop on the drive to Montreal."}
{"text":"Open at 9am on a Sunday, \"they must serve eggs!\" I thought to myself. Nope, just massive sandwiches of delicious smoked meat and fries. 10/10."}
{"text":"Taste great,very distinctive and mary local people. I like it has the characteristics of local food"}
{"text":"It is NOT better than Schwartz or Lesters or even Chenoy's.
Those who say it's the best place haven't tried elsewhere.
Pay an extra $3.00 for getting less fat meat! A bit overpriced.
This place can get very crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"I dont give 5 star reviews, but Smoke Meat Pete deserves it. We just moved to the West Island and love to try new places. Smoke Meat Pete stood out with its rustic appeal, quick services and moist smoke meat with full of flavours! We are going to be eating there regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meat sandwiches!  Never disappointed and never can get enough! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"$7 + tax for a \"regular\" poutine which was a tiny little bowl which looked more like a side dish and had almost no sauce on it.  $6.85 including tax for a domestic beer.... Total rip off!  They brought my food 20 minutes before my friends so I was done by the time she got hers and we couldn't eat together.  Smoke meat sandwich that my friend got looked about half as full as the Montreal counterparts and had a bunch of fat chunks in it even though she ordered lean.  Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"This place is just as good as people say! 

My mouth is watering just thinking about it! I'm from out of town and have family that live in the area so I've wanted to come here for sooo long! 

We came for lunch and made it just in time before the line up! I ordered your typical smoked meat special that comes with the sandwich, fries, coleslaw, pickle on the side and a fountain drink (not refillable). Then after having that...decided to try their smoke meat Poutine

The meat super tender and juicy! They put a good amount of meat in every sandwich with the perfect amount of mustard the bread was soft and slices were not too thin or thick. And fries are double fried!

If you've had Montreal Poutine then you'll know how good it is! Now imagine adding smoked meat to it, soooo good! 

You could probably guess I went home with some too. We bought some to cook at home and it was just as good!"}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwiches and excellent music too!
The servings are generous and the fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Having just eaten some Schwartz the day before, I still had the cravings for smoked meat.  Luckily we were in this area visiting some friends and I had to stop by.  I ended up getting a \"small\" smoked meat platter(it wasn't small by any means).  I honestly wasn't expecting this to be even close to Schwartz but wow it blew my mind.  This is every bit as good as Schwartz but without the long wait.  The platter comes with 6 pieces of bread and like a pound of fries.  I was able to make 3 sandwiches with the amount of meat they give also.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here for my usual when I go visit family and got some dried out smoked meat mixed in with fresh smoked meat.   Not cool...."}
{"text":"Pros: great service. Large portions. Live music on weekends. Great for a smoke meat craving.

Con's: no bike parking, gets busy at lunch, slightly over priced, I know this is a BBQ house but the salads are a joke. 

Overall, a must see landmark for the west island croud!! The Pete special is your best deal."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Smoked Meat places I have ever been to. If you are on the west island of Montreal, it is worth visiting. Arguably, this is as good or better than the famous deli's of downtown Montreal including Schwartz's and now-closed Ben's. Personally, I think it's better. It's a small place, no table service (just go to the counter as soon as you arrive) but the food is excellent. They also have live blues music most nights. What could be better?"}
{"text":"I live in Ontario and drive more than an hour to get there for the real deal - way better than anything in Eastern Ontario!  Real fresh juicy smoked meat with vanilla fries (like Lafleur's) and a sweetish-vinegar slaw and pickle wedge while you listen to live jazz.  As good as I remember Ben's was, Pete still is!  Sadly they are one of the few left of a culture that is fading into memory."}
{"text":"In a word \"Underwhelmed...\"

Heard tons of great things about this place but none of it was true... at least for lunch today.

when we went in it was very smokey inside to the point of burning eyes.... but I thought \"shoot I'm here in Montreal and I've heard lots about this place so maybe it's just how it's supposed to be...(yeah with smoke inhalation)...

We ordered 2 specials which were \"supposed\" to be hard to finish and that's where it all started... they only brought 1 and didn't pass on the second identical order so one of us ate while the other had to wait then...

The sandwich itself wasn't great in fact it was small and so soggy the bread fell apart in my hands...

And thought the waitress said sorry for the screw up of only giving 1/2 the order, no gesture to make up having to wait with a free pop or anything else was made....

Very poor customer service overall. I would not suggest this place based on the smoke, the portions, nor the customer service.

I had really expected much, much more!"}
{"text":"Definitely better than Schwartz's. Visited there quite often when I lived in Montreal. It's a bit of a drive away from the city, but makes up for it with more parking and less line up time than other places.
You line up and they deliver to your table. The smoke meat in town! Juicy and bursting with flavor.
The only down side (or up side) is that it does have a live band on weekends which make conversations nearly impossible."}
{"text":"What a nice experience;). Its our new place to stop when travelling from toronto to Montreal
Its a warm atmosphere like a cottage, very original place
The portions are generous, the smoke meat is excellent, everything is clean

 They played Blues while we were there really nice laid back place

I recommend it if you are looking for a nice relaxing laid back evening"}
{"text":"I've  been here a couple of times and had the most amazing rib steak the first time.
It came with liver,frank,fries and coleslaw for under $20.

Came back to try the smoked meat, my friend's sandwich had the good crusty part(which is delicious. Mine was from the pinkish center, not much flavour or spices.

The worst thing I had was the chicken and ribs combo, thankfully small portion covered in the nastiest gunky molasses like sauce.

Service is ok the first time, but second time was pretty awful. Waitress does not bring mustard or water, leaves in the middle of our meal, when we wanted an extra sandwich, they made us pay at the table before serving us.

It's a good 30 minute drive from downtown and the place is much smaller than I expected.

It has a roadhouse feel to it with blues music in the evening. I left before the band started playing,
I can believe the people that say it's loud, the sound system on satellite radio was very crisp and loud, so I can imagine a live band in a tiny place like this must be ear splitting"}
{"text":"Everyone comparing Schwartz.. like Petes parents aren't the owners.. anyways Petes meat can't be beat."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in Montreal I've tried. Do not get lean. Also for sale per pound. 

Good coleslaw if you like them vinegary. 

OK poutine and fries. 

Disappointing latka. 


No tips necessary last time I went. 

Regular portions of smoked meat sandwichs and poutine a bit overpriced. Get the large, instead, if you can finish the huge portions."}
{"text":"Alright I felt bad for leaving a lackluster review based solely on a dish that I knew was not representative of the greatness of this institution, so here I am going back to Pete's just 2 days later.

I went with a friend for the special on smoked mete spaghetti (2 plates for $13 on Mondays and Tuesdays). Although the pasta and sauce were generic, Pete's tender and peppery smoked meat just elevated the dish to a new level. It's a solid 4/5 for the dish. The meat is definitely more flavourful and less dry than Schwartz's. For such a generous portion at $6.50 a piece, this must be THE best value in town currently.

We were also just in time for a great jam night by the Jimmy James Band, along with participation from a few patrons and the man himself (Pete). With authentic blues and a pleasant smoky room, the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. We left well served, taking home with us some of Pete's signature smoke on our clothes. That's the true experience.

Really well worth the detour. Great smoked meat dishes and a real deep local feel."}
{"text":"Was heading through Montreal from Toronto and this is definitely a must stop every time.   I think they have the best smoked meat in Montreal.

The food is delicious.   Today split the $20 special which is a pound of smokes meat lots of pickles , a loaf of bread (for do it yourself sandwiches), and coleslaw.    

I got the medium amount of fat.   It was so juicy, I wish we ordered more.   

Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best smoked meat in Montreal. Their smoked meat poutine is also to die for. The bands playing make for a great ambience although on a busy night, it'll be hard to hear the person sitting next to you but all in all a great vibe with amazing food."}
{"text":"I've had Schwartz's (really good (the \"original\") but not worth the line-up and experience), The Main (good), Dunn's (good), and Le Roi du Smoked Meat (best overall meat and experience). I enjoyed Smoke Meat Pete's thick-cut and flavorful meat, but their fries were disappointing and the experience was just OK. Worth a stop if you're coming into Montreal from the west, but for me not worth the out-of-the-way trip from in-town."}
{"text":"As the slogan says, you can't beat pete's meat!! I'll take this over Schwartz' any day. Grilled liver with a hot dog is very good too."}
{"text":"You can't beat petes meat !!

Decided to stop off on New Year's Eve for a quick smoked meat and back on the road.

They decorated with lots of Xmas decorations so that's a huge plus ! Great family atmosphere going on, the stage is always rocking with great blues.

They were prepping for their New Years party and the owner even stopped to invite us very sweet but we already had plans :)

So to order they don't come to your table you gotta go to the counter and place your order and pay and then you can pick a nice wooden table to sit at. They added on a new part im pretty sure but I also haven't been in ages.

What you're gonna want is the smoked meat with fries pickle and coleslaw. So good. If you want Lean it's 3 dollars more but so be it that's how I like my meat lol.
They give you as a starter a hot dog with liver and bread coleslaw and butter. The ribs which I never had before were super sweet and tender packed with flavour! I would suggest those ribs to Anyone."}
{"text":"Last time I was in Montreal I did some online research to find \"the best smoked meat\".  I kept reading about Smoke Meat Pete's and how great it was.  I was skeptical.  After all, this is the internet.  Most people claim Schwartz's has the best and I'm not a fan of theirs.  Unfortunately that trip was in May and Pete's was closed.

I was in Montreal this past weekend and it was decide that we HAD to go to Pete's on the way back to the GTA.  

It's a hole in the wall, dive bar, kind of place, which only adds to the charm.  You go up to a window to order your food and then find a table and they bring it to you when ready.  The servers all seemed very nice and they all spoke English.  In fact, it's one of the few places where English is the first language they speak to you in.

When I first got my sandwich I was a little disappointed.  I ordered the jumbo and got a decent, if just slightly above average sized sandwich.  These guys should make a trip to Peter's on Eglinton in Mississauga to see what a jumbo smoked meat sandwich means.

When I took a bite, I was wowed!  The spices are amazing.  Honestly, this is the best tasting smoked meat sandwich I ever had.  

This will be a regular stop for me on any Montreal trip.

My wife had the smoked meat pouting, my kids had burgers, and the friends we were with had the ribs.  Everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Oh baba! This one is a keeper! I'll go ahead and say it, this beats the guys downtown. You know who I'm talking about... sandwiches are great, poutines too! Wish they had Rueben sandwiches, I'm a Rueben guy... but still I can appreciate the good work and technique here. They only take cash but atm onsite so no big deal. This place is a landmark, protect it."}
{"text":"Meilleur smoked meat!!!! Quand tu rentres la fumee et les bonnes odeurs vous envahi et le service est rapide.
Tres countey avec espace pour un band. Tres bon et je le recommande a tous les amateurs de smoked meat."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwiches anywhere. 
Order the jumbo special, which includes delicious fries, a very large smoked meat sandwich served on rye bread with mustard and it includes a side of coleslaw and a tangy dill pickle. You can also try the ribs, really good too."}
{"text":"CLOSED until MARCH 3

I've tired both Main and Schwartz in Montreal and Smoke Meat Pete's is perhaps the best. It was delicious even after sitting in a take out bag for an hour. The poutine was quite yummy too. I must also rave about the coleslaw which had a nice garlic flavour to it. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 star is because of he service. Very rude. 

We wanted to go back a second time today, however be warned peeps. They are closed for renovations from jan 28th to March 3, 2018."}
{"text":"Came in just before noon, so it was empty. got a take away sandwich to take to the office. The smell in the car on the way drove me insane - and I ate it as soon as I sat at my desk. definitely a good sandwich! great smoked meat. 
The restaurant itself looked nice, and I'd like to go back one night when there's a band playing."}
{"text":"A really great spot to grab lunch. Food portions were generous and everything hot and delicious. We shared a large platter between 2 of us and had lots of food. The kids had poutine with smoked meat and a sandwich. 
Pickles were yummy and garlicky and fries had a delicious sweetness to them with lots of little crispy bits. Worth the stop on your way into Montreal!"}
{"text":"We arrived 6:30 and place is half full. Around 7:30 place was fully packed and the live music started. 

The smoke meat sandwich combo comes with sausages and liver, coleslaw as well, pretty big portion. Ribs are bit too sweet for my taste, but still good.wings with salsa is definitely something I haven't tried before, right amount is spicy. 

Overall the vibe is really great. Seems a lot of regulars here. Price is affordable. Definitely one of the best place in Montreal for bbq and smoke meat"}
{"text":"After 15 years I've been here. I don't care what other say who has the best smoke meat. This is the best!!! It's getting pricey also."}
{"text":"I am not going to be a \"Debbie Downer\" (like some of these reviews). 
When I like a place I factor in the look of the place, the ambiance,  the \"feel\", the staff, and (obviously) the food.
First impressions are usually right when it comes to me and restaurants.
Either I love it or I don't.
Well this place is a complete winner to me.
It feels like I just stepped off the island of Montreal and landed in \"Bon Temps\" in True Blood, somewhere deep in the wet and wild hot south.
The little blonde (very cute) waitress just screams people's names and quickly brings everyone's food over to their rugged wood banquettes always wirh a smile and a swing of her pony tail.
It's 7pm and the bues band have already started their set, the beers are flowing and Pete's smoked meat is touching my lips for the first time and I am loving this whole experience! 
The rain has stated to come down outside and the people are coming back in from the mosquito netted outdoor seating.
This place is a restaurant? 
I forget. 
I tried Pete's Jumbo smoked meat Special with a black cherry cola.
I am not an specialist on smoked meat sandwiches but this one was definitely better than at Schwartz's (which I hate everything about; the place, the lineup,  the dirty toilet, etc...) which I never got why was so popular...?!
All I am sure of (apart from everything else) is that this little gem is WORTH THE DETOUR.
\"Keep on rockin me baby\" the singer sings.
That's exactly what I was thinking!
Love this place, the food, the girl, the live music, even the rain coming down and washing away the many mistakes in our past."}
{"text":"This place is definitely living off an old reputation which in my opinion is no longer deserved. 
I am a big fan of the types of meals served  here but after stopping here July 2017 for lunch with a friend I was very disappointed! 
The atmosphere is fun.. It reminds me of the old Pioneer! 
The live music is a wonderful idea.. But I noticed it seems that the better musicians just don't seem to want to play here anymore. 
That being said... atmosphere only goes so far.. Our order took almost 40 minutes to arrive (and the place was not busy)  and when it arrived it was a tiny piece of dry chicken. 
The prices have also been increasing steadily... So.. Full points on atmosphere... -
half points on the food.. 
Try the place.. you decide.. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been reading about \"Smoke Meat Pete\" for years on how great it was and how people felt that it was superior to Schwartz's and I so wanted to like it.

Well... it was ok but I don't think that the smoke meat compare to \"Schwartz's\" or \"Quebec Smoke meat\" in Pointe St-Charles and the experience is not either.

I felt also that it is an expensive place. On the plus side, it's open 24 hours a day and it's not far from my current home."}
{"text":"Always go there for lunch with my coworkers, we love this place! for me this is the best smoked meat in mtl! oh except it's not really in mtl....either way it's good food large portions and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Not the experience I was expecting. Firstly, the lady behind the cash register taking orders has a tremendous attitude problem. After paying over $50 for 3 smoke meat sandwiches with a couple of fries and slaw, we sat and waited for out plates. The decor is rustic and probably meant to encourage  turn-over, in& out clientèle. You eat and you leave, pretty much! The food it self was \"okay\". Smoked meat was dry and not that flavorful. For me, the rudeness of the lady who took our order will most certainly ensure I will not return there, EVER. If you are going to pay premium for so so food, at least be polite and courteous."}
{"text":"The owner is on stage doing a very credible version of Knocking On Heaven's Door as I write this. The food smells terrific as we are waiting for take-out. I could definitely come back here. 

2 super specials, plus two large fries for 5 people, $74 including tax. 

There's outdoor seating, screened and covered seating, and inside seating. 

Excellent smoked meat, pickles, fries. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has been delicious every time I've been.  The fries are crispy and the smoked meat is nice and juicy. When you get smoked meat elsewhere it doesn't even compare to the one at smoke meat pete's."}
{"text":"Excellent smoke meat sandwich! The meat is tender, lean and so flavourful. Just the perfect amount of juicyness and it didnt soak the bread! The music and overall ambiance was great. 

Why I didnt give it a 5 star:
- It was our first time here and we sat at the back after being there for at least 30 minutes no one came to see us. I went to a waitress who explained to me that you have to go to the cash to order both food and drinks. 
- The menu is on a changing display and you have to read fast and there is not much explanation of what the meals are.
- The beer selection on tap was limited to 2  coors and another that i dont rememenber"}
{"text":"Montreal is known for their smoked meat deli shops. On our drive to Montreal, my friends and I got super hungry so we decided to stop at the next closest smoked meat shop on our way into the downtown Montreal. We came across Smoked Meat Pete's. It was 4PM and it wasn't busy at all because who eats dinner or lunch that late. When we walked you, you basically go up and order first and then sit down until your order is ready. You usually get to choose the cut of meat and how fatty you like it. For me personally, I usually like the fatty cuts of the meat cause it tastes so good. Fries were okay. My other friends thoroughly enjoyed a filling meal. Overall, a decent dining experience and come on, who really doesn't like smoked meat in Montreal?"}
{"text":"Came here for their smoked meat spaghetti special (2 plates for $13 on Mondays and Tuesdays) and they definitely aren't cheap on the portion. We received a heaping plate of spaghetti topped off with a very very generous serving of smoked meat bits covered in a ladle tomato sauce. It was exactly the kind of food you would find on the show diners, drive ins and dives. 

Pasta and tomato sauce had nothing special to them but the smoked meat was absolutely succulent! Smoked for so long with a lot of peppercorns, the fatty bits would just simple melt in your mouth, literally. The rest of the plate was a bit too oily and heavy for my liking.

The spaghetti was also served with bread (the same one they use for sandwiches) and with the quantity of smoke meat they give you, you can easily make your own sandwiches!

Service is slow, forgetful (we go it food after 45 minutes and I had to go fetch the chilli flakes and parmesan because the waitress forgot) and even sometimes arrogant (we told them we've been waiting for 45 minutes but the waitress just told us that was the normal and brushed it off - turns out the gave our food to the wrong table...)

Overall, they have amazing smoke meat, the rest is meh."}
{"text":"This place deserve a 5 start. The smoke meat sandwich is amazing. The chips are a little sweet, but tasty. Steak is a little dry. Next time I will also order smoke meat. The decor and service are very good."}
{"text":"I've had every type of smoked meat on the menu and I believe that the food is absolutely amazing. They are way more generous than Schwartz's and the smoked meat is equally as good, if not better."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of smoked meat but friends convinced me this place was worth trying since we were in the neighborhood. The whole experience was rather chaotic. You order your meal at a counter, pay(credit card machine was broken), and they ask your name and tell you someone will bring you your meal.  After a fairly short wait a waitress came out yelled our name out over the loud music, we waved, and she gave us our sandwiches. I ordered lean meat so i double-checked which sandwich was lean. She looked at our bill, looked at our sandwiches and said 'yeah, that's lean meat' in a not very convincing way. Three minutes later another server came out, yelled a similar name, and served 2 sandwiches to the table next to us where the customers got a lean meat sandwich they clearly did not want. We said something which created more chaos and the server offered to fix things but didn't apologize for the mix up. Not a very satisfying experience. And I, admittedly not a fan of smoked meat, did not enjoy my sandwich at all. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"You can really start a great debate when you ask Montrealers which restaurant they consider the best for smoked meat. I think it comes down to personal preference. For example, I enjoy smoked meat that is between regular and fatty. The regular smoked meat at Smoked Meat Pete's is reasonably well marbled and tasty. However, I thought it was just a tad too tender- tiny bits of smoked meat kept falling off as I was eating, little crumbs that make you look crazy when you pick them up to eat (which I still did). 

Fries are thick cut, crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle. Their coleslaw is a vinegar-based one; you only get a small container with the jumbo special (I think there should be more to balance out the fries and sandwich). Sour pickle, excellent, maybe even too sour haha. 

Location is right off the 20 behind the Dairy Queen- easy to find. Lots of space to sit inside as well as a few tables outside, glorious on a sunny day. It's not my #1 smoked meat spot but it is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Best ribs and smoked meat i ever had. Pete is a stand up guy as well. 100 percent recommend to anyone visiting Montreal! (the coleslaw was bloody delicious as well)."}
{"text":"I've done the tour. Schwartz, The Main, Petes. In the end Pete always wins with the Smoked Meat and Fries. Have you tasted his suculent rib ends? Damn good stuff. Oh and the live blues on the weekends is as good as the food."}
{"text":"\"You Can't Beat Pete's Meat\".

That's cute.

Sadly for Pete, you certainly can.

Don't get me wrong. I didn't dislike my visit... I just didn't jump into the hype some previous reviews tried to buy me in.

A lot of people compare their experience to Schwartz but I think it's unfair, since they are located too far from one another to justify a little hop from one place to another unless you plan to drive for an hour in or out of town. However, I may refer to other smoke meat joints in the general Montreal region for comparison since \"You Can't Beat Pete's Meat.\"

I ordered a smoke meat sandwich and some fries. Nothing fancy. It still cost me close to 13$ so the price is competitive with other smoke meat joints in Montreal without the luxury of paying the same type of rent some others do.

Frankly, the sandwich portion was small and the cut I received fatty. The fries were cooked a bit too much for my taste. For the same price, in Montreal, sandwiches are far bigger and the quality of the cut is far better. 

Maybe I got short changed? Possibly. However, that was MY experience. Small fatty smoke meat sandwich with overfries.

The ambiance is interesting, I'm a fan of the old school decor. However, I'm not sure if it's for everyone as the place is a bit small and sitting on a communal bench with other clients may not be for everyone.

There seems to be a band setup right beside you eat, thankfully they weren't playing as I'm sure playing live being so close to them in a small place like Smoke Meat Pete would be hard on the ears.

The service was quick, friendly and efficient.

Lastly, they serve their sodas in bottles, I always give bonus marks for diner like places still respecting such tradition regardless of my experience there.

Would I go back? Maybe. Hopefully my experience will be better."}
{"text":"Best smoked beef brisket ever!!! The meat is so tender, perfectly done.  The rack is little bit dry and that's why I didn't give 5 stars.  Their slaw is great, too."}
{"text":"I first tried smoked meat sandwiches 5 years ago and didn't care for it.  I decided to try it again on my last trip, and my buddy (local), even though he's a vegetarian now,  recommended Pete.   I am now a fan of smoked meat sandwiches. I enjoyed the sandwich thoroughly.  Unfortunately they only take cash, but they still get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Just off the ass end of the west part of the island of Montreal is this little road house that serves up smoked meat that easily lays claim to the title \"better than Schwartz's\". It's certainly easier to park. And the fries easily eclipse Schwartz's. 

You order at a little cubby hole and then sit in the dining portion and await your waitress with your order. The Pete's special runs a hair under $10 for smoked meat on light rye, a pickle, slaw, and fries. The jumbo runs about $14 with about twice the meat. If you love getting your maw on a nice stack of amazing smoke meat, you'll probably want to get the jumbo.

The fries are heaven, with an almost creamy texture.

Come early as the place seems to quickly fill up on weekends by noon."}
{"text":"The food is better than Schwartzes.

The fries have a sweet quality I can't put my finger on.  The meat is more tender, and way more smokey.  Their coleslaw is delicious.

I've been here countless times and will return countless more, but man, are they ever getting greedy.  Prices are climbing each and every single time I go, and even for the Pete's Jumbo (the larger version of the sandwich), I have no problem putting it away completely and still looking for more..

Love the sandwich, but took two stars for climbing prices and dwindling portions"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat sandwiches we have tried. Our experiences are from Ottawa area so there may be better in Montreal but this is one place we will be going back to!"}
{"text":"Better than Shwartz in my experience. Pete's meat has enough marbling to make for a very delicious and tender sandwich but not enough to have you falling asleep on the wheel on the way to Quebec City. Their rye bread is good too with mustard and a pickle.. my mouth is currently watering. 

Their fries are also really crispy and tasty. They're slightly sweet, mouth watering again.

The coleslaw was even amazing. It's different than most slaws some how, more refreshing, less tangy? But they're a good texture and consistency change from the sandwich.

Try it if you happen to pass through and try it again when you come back. We did."}
{"text":"Great smoke meat and probably the best poutine and ribs I've ever had! Great place for motorcyclists to stop by for a bite and watch live music"}
{"text":"Clearly one of the best smoked meat deli sandwiches you can get.   Actually, I prefer Pete's Meat over Schwartz.

It is out of the way for Montrealers but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Just their slogan is enough.  \"You Can't Beat Pete's Meat\".

You really, really can't.

I pass through Montreal at least once a couple of times a year, and a trip to Smoke Meat Pete is absolutely an essential part of the experience.  Why?  Simple.  Located in L'Île-Perrot, it's a lot easier to get to than Schwarz's.  It has parking.  And why the Schwarz \"experience\" is something you need to have once in your lifetime, the food is simply better.

There are often live blue bands playing in the evening, it can get a little noisy... but frankly, if you're looking for romance or for conversation, you probably aren't looking for a smoked meat sandwich.  Or, if you are... well, you're doing it wrong.

Cash only - remember that.  There's an ATM in the back that will happily extort a big sum from you, but planning ahead will take care of that.  It's also not totally easy to find - if you're on A-20, you'll see a Dairy Queen - a really old looking one - it's just behind that.  You can cut through the DQ parking lot onto the side street it's on.

Definitely a part of the \"greater Montreal\" experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, only negative is it's dangerously close to my house! Most under rated dish on menu is the Louisiana sauccuage on a bun!"}
{"text":"I keep kicking myself because I was too hungry to snap a picture of my food before I started eating it. Came here by chance...just passing by on our way back to the US. We saw the smoke coming off the roof and the saw the acronym BBQ and we decided to stop here for lunch. 

You basically order inside at the cashier and then you can either sit inside or out in the patio. They call out your name and you just raise your hand and the waitress will bring you your order. They also accept American dollars here but not $50 or $100s. 

We ordered the ribs and chicken combo and the steak combo. Both were freakin AMAZING!!!!!  The combos both come with a hotdog, slice of liver, coleslaw, fries and bread and butter. 

Definitely the sweet and sticky type of BBQ...the chicken and ribs were fall of the bone tender. Fries were awesome cause they were cut with the skin still left on. Kind of sweet but weren't sweet enough to be considered sweet potato fries. Definitely crunchy and delicious. 

Family friendly and affordable. If I go back to canada I'll definitely stop by here again."}
{"text":"Delicious smokemeat!!! But why are the servers so angry and in a bad mood???? It made our lunch so much less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ouain. Au risque de me répéter, 3 étoiles ça veut dire \"A-OK\". Ça signifie que j'ai bien apprécié mon Spag au smoke meat, mais mettons que je m'attendais à un peu plus. Avec tous les bons commentaires que j'ai entendu sur cette place... La place est quand même le fun, avec les spectacles et la terrasse. C'est certain que je donne une deuxième chance bientôt. J'irai pour le traditionnel sandwich par contre."}
{"text":"I've been going there since I was a kid. The smoked meat is the best you'll find in the province (and maybe even the country). What's even better is that you can get a take-out meal for 2 including meat, bread and big container of pickles for only $20"}
{"text":"This place is a gem ! I love all the way downtown Montreal but I'd do the drive to smoke meat pete just to have their smoke meat ! It's just a straight forward place with the best smoke meat in town . Beats Schwartz , or any other hyped smoked meat places in Montreal  !  The ambiance is also great ! Worth the travel even if you don't live in ile Perot !"}
{"text":"I love this place. I feel genetically at home here like I was a happy go lucky bilingual blues loving smoked meat sweating biker in another life (or it's possible that describes me now.) I am a sucker for the old wood and wagon wheel lights, the stage that pushes up against the tables, the counter where you order what is in fact the best smoked meat on or around the island, the pickles, the perfect fries, the friendly staff - I especially love that moment when they call your name to bring you your food, and if you don't hear it the first time the whole joint starts yelling your name. Ah, the sweet hollar of belonging. Old school cokes in bottles, latkes and massive beef ribs, roast beef specials piled high with potatoes and gravy, tables outside next to a dairy queen, lord I could go on counting the ways in which this place is good for my little Montreal soul."}
{"text":"The food was just ok and the portions were small . The staff working there are lazy and rude. When ask how long for our order -they said \"it will come when it comes \" after 20 minutes of waiting . Took 40 minutes to get our order. It is not professional to tell a customer that spent over $60 for 3 and left a nice tip - we are to  busy to bring you mustard and make you wait 10 minutes . Clean up your attitude cause you are not the only place that offers average food. Not worth the wait or the bad service"}
{"text":"I've heard about Smoke Meat Pete's for the longest time but never had the opportunity to come and try it out. I finally had the opportunity to come near while driving to Ontario, so I decided to make a quick stop. A line up during Thursday lunch hours clearly shows just how popular this place must be with the locals. I followed most of them and got a special which comprises of a smoked meat sandwich, coleslaw and potatoes of your choice. The meat was very juicy, tender and full of flavour. Compared to some other well known establishments, the cuts here are thicker, so it gives a bit more of a chunky feeling. I have to say, it's hard to beat Pete's meat!"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat I've ever had!

I don't know if there are people who had the luxury of having Pete's and Schwartz just a couple of days apart like I did, but I am glad I did as it verified my conclusion that Pete's is better than Schwartz. 

I find it more flavorful and juicy; not dried out. At first, I thought it's because I've had the lean cuts at Schwartz, but I had a regular the last time and it still did not compare. The down side for Pete's is that it's not in Montreal and is a bit of a drive to L'Ile-Perrot. It's worth the drive though and perhaps that's best because it is quite a heavy meal. The price is reasonable as well. 

There was something different on this third visit to Pete's though. Perhaps it's because I went after lunch hours instead of during supper time, but it wasn't as good as the other two times. Yet still really good!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat plate, sandwiches, and fries were terrific. The server was rude. We requested an additional plate (at the same time we asked for ketchup) for a two year old girl that was sharing the smoked meat platter with her papa. The server gave a pissed off look and never brought one when she brought the ketchup. A second request also went unfulfilled.  One of us had to eat off of our napkin."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely a local haunt with live music on Friday nights and this place pretty packed in. 

We ordered the to go special (that can only be ordered to go). It was delicious and huge! You get an entire loaf of fresh rye bread, about 8 pickles (delicious, had about half of them myself), a jar of coleslaw, and a pound of smoked meat with two sodas of your choice. This was oodles of food and so good, the smoked meat is great here!

Also ordered a poutine with real cheese curds and real gravy with delicious fries that were slightly sweet to compliment the salty. AMAZING but so hot (in hindsight I probably should have waited to eat this to save my mouth, but t was worth it) 

The place has a very country bar feel, which is cute. You go up to the counter to order and take your feat to a table or to go. It's a little out of the way, but WORTH IT!!!!!

On the way to Montreal from Toronto!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Montreal smoked meat. I don't know if I've liked it before I had a sandwich at Smoke Meat Pete. That changed, and now I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Spoiler alert: I did not have the Pete's Special of any form. If you're looking for a review specifically for that, please look away.

I have previously eaten at Schwartz's in one of my past Montreal visits, but this time I needed to find one that's accessible by car. My Montreal friends recommended Smoke Meat Pete, so I decided to try this place out for lunch.

It was a little difficult punching the address into my GPS, but I eventually found the place. The place definitely has the \"country\" feel, and you can tell by the setup and music they play as well. The employees here are perfectly bilingual, and for the most part will speak English first. I can communicate in French to an extent, so I decided to respect them and ordered in French.

I was ready to order the Pete's Special, until my dad decided to interrupt me and demand me to order the smoke meat spaghetti special. I was a little hesitant at first, but decided to order the special as it was for two. The smoke meat spaghetti had an overpowering amount of meat sauce and a lot of spaghetti (hence it was for two)...however I found it so overpowering that I couldn't taste the smoked meat at all. The meat sauce and spaghetti was quite good though, so I'll give them that. 

After showing my disappointment to my dad, he finally agreed for me to order a smoked meat entree, and I did just that. There was definitely a stronger smoke meat taste this time around, however I really did notice a weaker taste overall compared to Schwartz's. In terms of healthiness though, Smoke Meat Pete definitely wins in that regard.

Service was great, and the lady who served our food knew perfectly whose food was who's, and if she didn't she will remember the name, if you speak English or French, and you will still receive it regardless.

I'll give Smoke Meat Pete one more try next time I'm around, as one huge benefit is that there's no one hour lineup unlike Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Hands down the best smoke meat in the city! And such a great vibe from the place! Especially when there's live music!"}

{"text":"Killer fries, killer bagels, good smoked meat but there are better in the west island.  Still an awesome dining experience!"}

{"text":"I have heard about this place from my \"west-of-the-city\" friends for a very long time and finally had the pleasure of checking it out for myself. 

First thing to know is that it's a busy place pretty much all the time, so don't be surprised if it takes a bit of time to get a table. Fortunately, the restaurant staff is super friendly and efficient so if you do have to wait, it shouldn't be for too long.

I ordered the standard smoked meat sandwich with fries, coleslaw and a black cherry soft drink. The fries and coleslaw were great and the piece de resistance, the smoked meat, was fantastic!

My only complaint would be for the size of the poutine that my friend ordered. For the price, it was really not worth it. But hey, when you go to a restaurant with the words \"smoked meat\" in its name, you best order the smoked meat.  :)"}
{"text":"I don't like smoked meat. Or at least I never did until now. 
Let me keep this super short & simple: GO! It's so good! 
A tad pricy if you ask me considering it's a smoked meat sandwich but totally worth it. 

Bring me back a smoked meat sandwich when you go please!!! Actually make that 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Their epic large gravy poutine with chopped smoked meat? Woo!!! Delicious! It was worth every penny. Nice that it's out of the city, so it was perfect for us to stop by on our way back to Toronto. I'm surprised that I didn't fall asleep on my drive... I would imagine their sandwiches are delicious as their poutine.

Pass on the bagels and latkes. Wifey didn't want to eat meat, but man, were they boring and plain. And expensive."}
{"text":"Very good, loud and pricey. If rock and roll and blues music is your thing then this place is right up your alley.
 
I recommend getting a standard meal which is a plate, comes with there famous smoked meat sandwich and there very famous french fries. This restaurant has high turn over and is busy quite often. This has been argued as best smoked meat in Montreal. Also best French fries in Montreal. I agree 100% with French fries, and smoke meat is usually pretty delicious. I order it Medium and ask for\" Speck\" its the spicy brind on outside of smoked meat,its delicious. They also have a club roll which is smoked meat,salami and turkey on a roll. Delicious! 

Smoked meat Poutine is intense and delicious, however depending on who cooks your food there poutine and even smoked meat plate can be stingy on portions! Also its quite pricey for what you get. 


They are open late Thursday,Friday,Saturday. Till 3am. 

I usually take it to go and have the special with a cherry cola. All around this restaurant is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat place in Montreal hands down! Definitely better than the oh so famous Schwartz downtown. The smoked meat is perfectly cooked and prepared- not too dry and not too fatty. Their fries are amazing as well! Relatively quick service and they have live music as well, which is always a plus, though it can get a little loud. Be sure to try them out if you're near the west end!"}
{"text":"There are few words to explain this. Smoke Meat Pete serves up the freakin' best Smoked Meat sammich you will ever have in Montreal and since Montreal is the world capital of smoked meat, you see there this is going..."}
{"text":"Good solid off-island smoke meat in an authentic BBQ joint. I enjoyed the vibe and the simple setup. You can tell they care in doing things simple and right. It must be a go to place in this area, I would go back. I ordered a Jumbo Pete's smoke meat and I have to say it didn't seem Jumbo at all. It was a typical size I would expect for a smoke meat plate. The coleslaw was salty but the fries were perfect. I didn't choose my type of smoke meat but it was good, but oily. Overall probably one of the best options in this area."}
{"text":"Avant d'aller plus loin avec la lecture de cette critique, vous devez comprendre une chose : je suis un fan de sandwich smoke meat. J'adore le goût de ces belles tranches de buf épicée et de leur enivrante odeur fumée sur charbon de bois.  Ceci étant dit, voici l'histoire de ma première visite dans cet endroit que certain amateur qualifie de mythique. 

Contrairement à bien d'autre, la réputation de SMP m'était inconnue. Shame on me ? J'ai découvert l'endroit par hasard en passant en voiture devant ce petit restaurant au toit rouge. Le titre a tout de suite attiré mon attention \" Smoke Meat Pete \". Ça sonne bien, non ? Ma bien-aimée, native de Dorion, m'a raconté que son patron quittait parfois le centre-ville pour y amener des collègues ou des amis. Faut le faire non ? Quitter le centre-ville de Montréal pour venir jusqu'ici représente 30 km.

Un jeudi soir, je me donc présenté ici avec des attentes élevées, et malheureusement, pour y vivre une expérience mitigée. Voici pourquoi... 

Oui, la viande fumée est DÉLICIEUSE. Les épices sont goûteuses, relevée juste à point et la viande possède vraiment ce goût de bois fumée que l'on retrouve juste ici. Elle est vraiment unique car fumée sur place. Et ça se sent dès que l'on passe la porte de SMP. On est accueillit par cette belle odeur de bois brulé qui flotte dans l'air. Merveilleux...

L'endroit commence à perdre des plumes à partir d'ici. D'abord, le service est assez ordinaire. Une fois à table, il faut se lever, faire la file et commander au petit comptoir. Une fois les assiettes livrée à notre table, la serveuse n'a pas daigné revenir pour s'informer de nous. 

Secundo, les prix sont exagérés. Un repas pour deux nous a couté plus d'une quarantaine de dollars, pourboire non inclus. Pour de la restauration rapide, c'est cher payé. Le plus ridicule : j'ai dû cracher 3.95 $ pour un extra de sauce brune pour accompagner nos frittes, ainsi que 2 $ pour un extra de viande maigre. Vous avez bien lu. Il faut débourser un extra pour une viande maigre ! C'est bien la première fois que je vois ça dans un resto à smoke meat.

Dernier point négatif, SMP accueil parfois des groupes de musique. Je suggère donc d'éviter les soirs de spectacle. L'endroit est petit et le son est vraiment trop fort. Nous occupions la table la plus éloignée de la scène et il nous était impossible de tenir une discussion tant la musique était forte. Ce qui nous a obligés de quitter l'endroit dès le repas terminé, afin de reprendre notre discussion. 
 
Ma critique décortiquée :
La viande : 5 *
Le service : 3 *
L'ambiance : 2 *
Les prix : 1 *

La bouffe est excellente, mais on oublie tout le reste. En passant Pete, sans rancune pour le 3.95 $ d'extra pour un petit plat de sauce..."}
{"text":"From what I've ate, Pete's meat is as good if not better than you know where...(wink wink).   Ample seating, live bands (see site for dates) and the waitress are very attentive.  The only grip is that you have to order first (only one cashier) and then sit down.  The lineups can be long but that's because the people in front of you don't know what to order and ask a zillion questons or from out of town.  The menu is on the wall people!  I'm starving here!  The cashier is too nice and takes her time and forgets that there's 15 or more hungry people waiting in line.  Luckily the line is indoors so rain or snow you are sheltered.  Other than that I would give it 5 stars!  FYI, you can bring a vacumed brisket into the US.  woo-yah!"}
{"text":"It pains me to dock this place 3 stars since the food, music and atmosphere were pretty decent. Those things matter, if you're visiting a friend's place for dinner. But in this case, I had paid almost $20 for a sausage on a bun that I had to go chase down 50 min after ordering. Which I had chosen because the menu on the wall indicated it would cost $9. (The menu is confusing. I'm on a budget. #FML) 
While waiting for the kitchen to find my lost order, I noted a small crowd of other patrons in the same boat: all having waited more than 30min for their food and starting to climb the walls. The staff seemed well-used to this routine (\"Folks, please keep this area clear...\")  
If I thought it was just a bad night I would never penalize them by docking so many stars. But their ordering and seating system (with no real table service) just isn't designed to handle the peak volume at this place. Servers run around shouting people's names looking for them. Orders get mixed up and lost. Judging by the complaints here and elsehwere, it's not a new situation, the management seems to have just decided to selectively ignore it.
TL;DR: If you're in a rush, trying to stick to a budget, or more than 30% hungry, go somewhere that's run by people who know how to run a restaurant, not just how to cook for a few people."}

         Where there is smoke there is meat with a lot of connective tissue that if cooked at a low temperature, over a long period of time, will create the most succulent thing known to man. The man that knows this art all too well, is Pete.

         What I love most about Pete's is the smell. You walk in and are hit with a Mike Tyson like blow of hickory/mesquite and god only knows what else. Be forewarned, the smell sticks with you. On one occasion, post Pete's, I was engaging in an activity that causes one to sweat profusely, if done right.  Whilst sweating, I began to emanate the smell of smoked brisket. Needles to say, it made the endeavour that much more carnivorous.,

      Pete can commonly be found behind the pass slinging to his hearts desire or making the rounds ensuring the custys are happy, always smiling and warm. You can tell he loves what he does. To Boot he usually has a kickass band playin

       Schwartz's, The Main, Quebec Smoked Meat...they're all good but I would trample a gang of cane carrying grandmothers to get to Pete's meat, combined with the atmosphere and the pleasant servers, it can't be beat.

{"text":"Great little place off hwy 20 on the way back from Quebec to Toronto.  No frills kind of place that focus in the food.  Servers are friendly, food is dependably delicious and menu has smoked meat, ribs , chicken and there take out is great.  Second time we've had a chance to stop and making it a regular part if the drive back routine.  Ribs were surprisingly teriyaki tasting but very tender.  Not fall of the bone, but the way they are supposed to be, tender but still with some pull back."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb. First of all, I have to tell you that they carry Cott Black Cherry soda, because I would never want anyone to miss out on this favoured beverage of Jewish summer campers everywhere. Next, you must have their latkes - they are the closest thing I've ever had to my Bubbi's perfect potato pancakes. 

The ribs are practically candied in the sauce and they fall off the bone. Just the right amount of spice in a sauce that is unique - not what you'd get anywhere else, and much better than what the chains are dishing up.

The vibe is rowdy and fun, the plates are copious, and the live music is a blast. Service is quick and super friendly. Everything we ate, from the smoked meat to the crispy fries to the coleslaw was fantastic, so I recommend going with a few friends so that you can order as many things as possible. You'll have leftovers, but they probably won't last the car ride home."}
{"text":"Après avoir entendu les annonces à la radio et en avoir entendu parler de mes amis à plusieurs reprises, on a profiter des routes fermées de la fin de semaine (Tour de vélo?) pour s'aventurer ailleurs que dans le centre de l'Île. Le Smoke Meat Pete est assez facile à trouver et dès que j'y suis entrée, j'ai été agréablement surprise de l'atmosphère de la place. Ça sent le bois dur fumé à plein nez! Les options sont assez variées et il devient évident que le plus simple est simplement de se prendre un spécial Smoke Meat Pete, ou bien le géant si vous avez une faim de loup! On a pris notre lunch pour emportez parce qu'il faisait beau, mais autrement, je serais restée à la place comme telle parce que c'est beaucoup plus joli que ce à quoi je m'attendais. J'ai bien aimé le sandwich, surtout parce que la viande était juteuse sans être graisseuse. Le pain était très bine aussi et le pickle et la salade de choix, juste assez vinaigrés pour bien accompagner la viande. La chose qui m'a déçu un peu c'est les frites. Je les ai trouvé bien ordinaires, semblables à celles de n'importe quel camion à patates. Ça vaut la peine de faire le détour au moins une fois pour l'essayer, ou en route vers l'ouest."}
{"text":"By now I've tried pretty much everything important on their menu, except the steak.

I've had their smoke meat sandwich, pasta, ribs, chicken and liver steak.

The smoke meat has a peppery crust and is much more tasty (more smokey and beefy) compared to the ones at Reuben's and Schwartz's. It probably is the best smoke meat in terms of flavour in Montreal, but I'm not a fan of pastrami, so I might be crowning the wrong guys like Steve Harvey.

The ribs (spare ribs) have been brushed with a thick and sweet molasses sauce. They've been cooked right but I'm not really a fan of that sauce.

The chicken is moist and tasty, different from the open fire grilled half chicken I get at Portuguese rotisseries. Note: it doesn't come with crispy skin like St-Hubert's.

The liver steak is... a big piece of liver and that's not something I particularly enjoy. No matter how it's cooked, I can't get my head to wrap around liking it.

As far as pricing goes, I'd say it's very standard, but considering its location, I think it could be a bit cheaper (heck, Montrealers already have to drive 30min to get there). 

Anyway, the environment is somewhat of a honky tonk and not a good place for a first date. The live music (usually blues) is very loud. In fact, it's better to enjoy the food and pray for good blues songs because there's no way you can get any meaningful conversation across the table.

But this is THE place to go with real close friends (or people you don't wanna talk to). Enjoying live blues has been the reason I find myself in the wild wild west -- Ile-Perrot xD"}
{"text":"Small, Cozy and Tasty. 
Live music adds a great touch to the experience of what is to eat at Smoke Meat Pete. 

Worth the trip, best smoke meat in town."}
{"text":"Wow what a place. Besides the great music. The ribs are just fantastic. I did try both smoke meat and ribs. I can't wait to go back when I do not have jet lag and see more music."}
{"text":"Bar none the best smoked meat in Montreal. Better than Schwartz's you ask? I would have to say yes.... unless you prefer to stand in line, sit in a cramped space and get served by a rude waiter only to get a sandwich with a body hair in it.  I live near Schwartz's but I go to Smoke Meat Pete a lot more often. This post is by no mean an anti-Schwartz's post... in fact, if you're a tourist, no visit to Montreal is complete without going to Schwartz's.  

I've been frequenting Smoke Meat Pete for at least 10 years. The meat is consistently moist and full of flavors, the fries and potato latkes are delicious and the coleslaw and pickles are awesome. The ribs are also one of  the best in Montreal. Whenever I go, I am always debating between the ribs or the sandwich but always end up with the smoked meat (I just cannot resist it). I wished they would offer a ribs and smoked meat sandwich combo. 

So grab a car and head out west!"}
{"text":"Smoke Meat Pete is really up there with Schwartz! But i must say i prefer even more SMP for its live blues performance and gosh, so much easier to get a sandwich without waiting for half an hour outside! The meat are packed with flavor without being too salty and the fat is distributed perfectly! The fries are crisp to perfection and its coleslaw salad rocks!  Even though it is cash only, this place is a definite must go for any smoked meat fan out there!"}
{"text":"If you feel like smoke meat go for it. I can say its good but the price is not that good. Very popular place. They have bands playing rock sometimes. Terrasse et parking available."}
{"text":"This is a little place that we got to off the highway.  It's a busy place but well worth it.  It is known for their smoked meat sandwiches but my favourite thing here is their BBQ RIBS.  They  are so tasty and the sauce on it is a dark dark sauce and I think there's coffee in it or something amazing as I have never had ribs like this before.  Tip:  Know what you want when you get in line as you have to order and go fast as it's a busy place."}
{"text":"So after thinking about this place for a while I finally decided to go last Friday for lunch. I ordered to go and there was no wait to order and my meal was ready in about five minutes.

I ordered the Special which is a smoked meat sandwich with your choice of potato side (fries, latka, potato salad) and a 12 oz fountain drink all for $14.

The smoked meat sandwich was to put it mildly, intense. It really does live up to the hype, if only because it's dripping with (amazingly delicious) fat. I've ordered the fatty cut at Schwartz's but I've never seen a cut like this before. Wow it was good. 

The latka was amazing too and I'm glad I ordered it instead of fries. It comes with a small container of sour cream. It actually was good enough to distract me from the smoked meat!

Overall I'd say this place is well worth the trip if you're coming from downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Ça fait plusieurs fois que je vais chez Pete jamais était déçus les smoked meat sont toujours très bon 
Et généreux en viande la Poutine très bonne surtout avec du smoked meat ;) pâte de foie numéro 1 

Belle place dans le restaurant y a beaucoup de place pour s'asseoir et ses presque toujours plein le soir 

Service numéro 1"}
{"text":"Tender, juicy, flavorful smoked meat with lightning fast service.  Every bit as good as Schwartz's without the wait, and great music to boot. 

If you've it a little kid, they've for high chairs and an outdoor area to relax and enjoy your meat in. It's a bit of a haul from the city, and well worth it. 

I'll be coming here again!"}
