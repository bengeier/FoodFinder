{"text":"Everything else around old Montreal is expensive. So if you are on a budget, this place is your best option"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for burgers and salads, but started off with an appetizer of nachos, after about 30 minutes of sitting with an empty plate and empty drinks, we decided that it wasn't worth staying, we actually never saw our waitress after she gave us the nachos.
Mediocre food, terrible service"}
{"text":"The best part of my breakfast/brunch here was the excellent service. After walking around for almost an hour trying to settle on a place for brunch, we finally chose this place because of the reasonable prices and great location. It was a good choice. The food was good and it was a nice surprise that coffee and orange juice came with the meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been back twice since my last review and all I have to say is that their beer is not cold enough. It's too warm. I'm a neighbor and I refuse to go back unless you lower the temperature of your beer, specially on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Hello there tourist (or just a Montrealer having fun in Old Port?)! Looking for a place to eat? Looking for a place to rest? Looking for a place to look at (the other) tourists and horses and luxurious cars and a view? This might be an option for you! Nothing too fancy here. Nachos? Sure why not! Burger? Yeah! They have burgers too! Drinks? You pay! Service was good, really kind! Food was not that special but tasted like a good homemade meal so that's good! Enjoy yourself while eating (outside if possible). I'm sure there are better places than this but it's an option!"}
