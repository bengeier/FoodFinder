{"text":"This place has been renamed Tostadas Grill but the place is still the same. I really wanted an empanada but there was nothing in the hot oven (and they don't have it listed on the menu board) so I ordered an arepa. Same as I remember, hard to chew and really greasy (i had the mix: Chicken and beef) but inexpensive"}
{"text":"Good food, the interior isn't the best although the good prices and even better deals  make up for it. Two empenadas for 5 dollars, tax. Included. I would definitely go again, my only complaint is how hidden they are. And the fact that the store name is now changed to Tostadas grill. And just to be fair this was my first empinada,"}

I tried to make the person that said \"pork fat rules\" proud.  I did try.

The Colombian Grilled Corn Arepa was not much easier to chow on.
By the second bite, it was no longer about casually enjoying a meal.
It became a Culinary Challenge!

I no longer cared how it would come out the other end.
I just knew this thing was going DOWN one way or another.
Dipping into the Hot Sauce to make it more malleable.
I needed every advantage possible short of pouring Soda on it.
In the end, 3 bites remain I threw dirty napkins to hide my shame.

Challenge Failed."}

My experience with Arepa is limited...  aside from having the Venezuelan style  Arepa at Arepa Cafe http://www.yelp.ca/biz/arepa-cafe-toronto#hrid:Pxplj67nbkQA-VCbm8_93w/src:self which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

When my Yelp Friend suggested Arepiando, I am IN!

Prices wise, Arepiando's Arepa is almost half of what Arepa Cafe is charging... but the location of course matters a lot!! Arepiando is located in a Latin American area up in North York, while Arepa Cafe is down in Queen St West. The set up of Arepiando is more like a takeout place where you can watch the cook/cashier/owner preparing your arepa through the glass window.

Arepiando might serves really authentic Colombia Arepa, but I didn't enjoy the white corn arepa as much, I found that it was just too crunchy and chewy.  Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!

My Yelp Friend decided on: 

Arepa con Chicharron ($5) - Fried Pork Skin with Cheese
- So chewy... so dried... I am glad I still have all my teeth if not I won't be able to eat the pork... but I might have problem digesting it though
- taste wise, it was pretty bland, the hot sauce on the side was pretty weak, I tried to dip it in the dressing.....

Arepa Ranchera ($4) - Eggs with Chorizo and Cheese
- definitely a breakfast sandwich.. the scrambled eggs were really fluffy but unfortunately the sausages were on the dry side

Lulo Juice Cocktail ($1.50) and Strawberry Soda ($1.50)
- My first experience with Lulo was good which has a citrus flavour
- My friend's Strawberry Soda tasted just like cough syrup!! But he like cough syrup!

The lady was so nice, even gave us a chicken empanada to try... but the empanada was meh too... bland and dry...

I really want to like Arepiando........ Maybe it is just me??"}
