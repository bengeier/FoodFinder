{"text":"It's only open until five. So, don't look at the listed hours, but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great. Clean , Friendly and very good food just like my Nana food. I highly recommend them the other Mexican business better watch out. The price is right. Took my whole family and feed them all for less than 40.00"}
{"text":"After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!"}
{"text":"The food was good.... service was ok (one poor girl doing it all). They refused to accept the Entertainment book coupon.  They claimed they didn't know how it had gotten there."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place in the area.  I've been here about 4-5 times now and food has been good every time.  I've had tacos, I've had the biryani which is a goat stew, I've had chilaquiles, I've had ceviche, and everything has been delicious so far.  The ladies who run the place are very nice and it's a real asset to the neighborhood to have them here. This is probably the closest little restaurant of any kind to where I live, which makes it very convenient, and the food is better quality then KFC, Church's Chicken or the other fast food places nearby.  Their condiments have been nice and fresh every time, too.  I'mma keep comin' back!

PS--bring cash, no cards here."}
{"text":"I worked in Chandler for a couple of years and never noticed this place, but came across it on yelp when I was staying out there one weekend.  Luckily I read ahead of time that they do not take cash.  That alone is the only reason to not give this place five stars.  In this day and age you can hook a device to your phone and process credit card payments, so not doing so is pretty unacceptable and unaccommodating.  Beyond that though I walked in and the lady behind the counter was extremely nice.  She took my order and gave me some chips and salsa while I waited for my to go order...nice touch!  The salsa was amazing as was the food.  Great place and I would stop more often, but I just don't carry cash like that."}
