{"text":"A little upset. This is the second time my boyfriend and I have attempted to come to this establishment during business hours and they were closed. This is just bad business."}
{"text":"The Jerk Hut is delicious! The jerk chicken, oxtail, patty, rice, and plantains were seriously good ... as good as the jerk we had in Negril. The folks that work here are lovely too."}
{"text":"AWESOME had it today for the first time the ox tails where so tender wish I had more and the jerk chicken had GREAT flavor REAL JAMAICAN'S cooking GREAT ISLAND FOOD."}
{"text":"It was hard to decide whether or not to give this place a 3 or 4 star, but I decided on 4 because I have only eaten here one time and plan to go back when the food is fresher. We (my mom, boyfriend and I) went to the Jerk Hut last night for dinner about an hr before they closed, and considering the food was buffet style and had been sitting for who knows how long, almost everything we ate was delicious. 

The workers were wonderful! They let us sample anything we wanted, and informed us about each dish and their specials. We all ordered and shared the Oxtail, curry chicken, and jerk chicken with plantains, cabbage, and rice. Each dish had its own unique and bold flavor that complimented our sides well. I loved the flavor of the oxtail the best, but for those who don't like fatty meats oxtail is not the way to go as most of it was pure fat. The curry chicken was wonderful, although was slightly lacking in white meat for my tastes (as you can tell I am a picky meat eater). Finally, the jerk chicken had great flavor, but obviously had been sitting WAY to long. It was extremely dry/hard. They really shouldn't have even been serving it like that. 

All in all, I liked it. They were out of the meat patties so I would like to go back and try them, along with a fresher batch of jerk chicken. My suggestion would be to go around lunch time instead of dinner- to avoid dry chicken and what not. Also try the \"ginger beer\" in the cooler. So delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I love Jamaican food.  I had the jerk chicken which is a whopping $10.95, with cabbage and rice n peas, chicken has ok flavor, rice and peas kind of dry with ok flavor, and cabbage meh, I ate only about 20% of my food the rest went to the garbage!!  Also tried a beef patty the filling was delicious, but the crust was so hard I pretty much only ate the middle, well that was a $15.00 lesson.

  I have been to Jamaica and ate traditional food made by friends and this is nothing like it, so I am sorry to say I will not be going back, maybe other things on the menu are better?  Area is not so great either."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken was fantastic! The oxtail was ok. Part of what makes oxtail great is the right gravy. This was too watery to be considered gravy . I will try them again because everyone has an off day and the jerk chicken alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"No one picks up phone. Not even sure if phone line still works now. If the location is shut down, can this please be listed and shown as closed to not waste consumers time. Worst thing u can do is have someone show up and u aren't in business anymore."}
{"text":"Place is legit and the owners are super nice. Will be returning in the near future......"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Oxtail was awesome. Plantains were just like I remembered them in the Carribbeans. The jerk chicken was okay... Needs a little more heat. Beef patty good (I'd eat it again). The workers were outstandingly nice."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went there on Friday night. We were greeted by friendly & helpful servers who explained to us newbies what everything was. The food was delicious. I had curry goat and a beef patty and Marie had fricassee chicken. Quite flavorful, nice intense spices, not too hot, just right kick. The steamed red cabbage was really good. The red beans and rice were perfect. And the portions were huge! They have a nice selection of Jamaican soda, make sure to try one or two. Too bad they don't carry Red Stripe, though. Hopefully they will in the future.  The place is kinda small, and I'm not one for eating while facing a wall. so we got our food to go. All in all we had a positive experience and we will be back for sure and would definitely recommend it to our friends. Jamaican food is irie, mon! Just make sure you come early if you want jerk chicken because I saw they were out of it by 7:30 pm."}
{"text":"We ordered Escovitch red snapper, rice& peas, cabbage and plantains. Fish was fresh, fried well, and good flavor. 

Service was amicable and accommodating. Small home cooked feel of a spot in Phoenix on 19th. Living in NYC, Atlanta and Miami the food is comparable. 

Only reason for not getting 5 stars is the rice tasted a bit stale, not too bad but not as good as I've had before. Also, no real music element to add to the cool and laid back vibe...But, I'll return."}
{"text":"I've been looking FOREVER for a place that serves Jamaican Beef Patties.  Every where I go in Arizona, nothing!

I found this place on yelp and read that they do serve them so I just had to feed my cravings and give it a try.

I'm not fond of Jamaican food so this review is pretty much on their store and beef patties.

It's a small store with few seating but the place is homey.  They had a few jamaican dishes and combos available for a decent price.  

I came for the Beef Patty and to my surprise they were fresh.  It wasn't as flaky as I'm used to eating it, however the taste was there and that was the most important thing.  The lady gave me a little warning that it had a bit of spice to it, however it was a spice I could handle.  Definitely better than a Golden Crust beef patty.  I just wish they had coco bread to go along with it.

I'm definitely going to make the trip back just for these awesome delicacies."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service. I've had the jerk chicken & curry shrimp. They haven't had the full menu available either time I went. They deserve a return trip I hope this place is around for awhile, I need to try the stew chicken! Oh and they give you a ton of food."}
{"text":"Great food. AMAZING tastes and EVERYTHING IS FRESH. The service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We finally found the Jerk Hut after being in Phoenxi for 4 years and not being able to find any Jamaician food at all. They had some big shoes to fill as we are from New England and from a prominent town where it is 80% Jamaician.  We could go to any corner and get some jerk chicken or jerk pork.  Anyways, we laughed when we pulled up because just like home, no parking.  We pulled around back and foud a spot.  Inside reminded me of home (just missing loud music). We didn't know what to order so we decided on the curry goat, jerk chicken and also some beef patties.  The Jerk was on point!  Loved the flavors of all the spices.  Curry goat was also delish!  Beef patty was also very good (the owner told me they order them).  As for the rice and beans and cabage, it was ok.  I think they use jasmine rice and I didn't care for it with the flavors.  And the cabage was undercooked (hard).  Other then that I am still very happy I found this place. They are a little pricey too, I think they should cut some of the prices as the beef patty was 2.95 each and no coco bread. (back home they are $1.25) 
I want to try the oxtail and jerk pork next time we go.

{"text":"Best jerk chicken I've had outside Brooklyn, the kind where after you take the first bite, you just sigh and get that feeling like you get after really good sex. My only suggestion would be a slightly larger portion. I had the dark meat with a leg and small thigh. Throw in a wing or make it a breast and a thigh or a leg and I'm in heaven. Worth the price. Now if they just had coco bread to go with the beef patties..."}
{"text":"I LOVE the brown stewed chicken.  I didn't care for much of anything else that came with the meal. The rice was hard, dry and tasted like it's been heated up in the microwave over and over again.  I didn't like the festivals - not much taste there.

It's a small restaurant.  Not much to look at besides the strange people that's standing on at the bus stop right outside.  Unfortunately, I went to Jerk Hut for a work lunch. We could barely hear each other speak because the cook was chopping chicken sooooooo loudly.   If I didn't know any better I would have assumed he done so on purpose.  I know he didn't but dern he was loud.

It turned me off from every dining inside again.  When I have the urge for Brown Stewed chicken and don't feel like making it myself I'll be sure to grab dinner from Jerk Hut to go!"}
{"text":"I've had jerk chicken many times and I have to say this is some of the best, if not the best, I've ever had! I got a door hanger from this spot today and decided to check it out (how's that for instant clientele eh?). It's a small spot right on the North East corner of Indian School and 19th Ave, right next to the Dominos. The menu is small, but the flavor and authenticity more than makes up for that. I ordered the jerk chicken and wifamus prime (yup, I just called her that) got the curry chicken. Both came with the traditional rice and peas (not actualy peas, but beans mixed in the rice) and a few soft grilled plantains. My Jerk Chicken was out of this world! The marinade was bold and flavorful and they even poured some more of the jerk glaze on after, which was awesome! It wasn't too terribly spicy, I'd say maybe a 4 out of 10 (which is perfect for me) The rice was perfectly moist and fluffy, just how it should be. the plantains were cooked perfectly how I like them, soft and super sweet. My wife's curry chicken was good too. They've got other Jamaican staples like curry goat, ox tails and curry fish. They also have the beef patties, but happened to be out today (booo, guess I'll just have to go back) Overall a great little spot with perfect service for a little takeout joint, excellent food and great island flavor in the heart of Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this establishment and as exicited that there was a new Jamaican restaurant in town.  Ever since Max & Myrls closed downtown (was located where Wild Thaiger is now), i have been searching in vain for great Caribbean food.  The Jerk Hut hits the mark.  It is by far some of the best Jerk Chicken I have tasted.  The spice is perfectly balanced between spicy and just a hint of citrus.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and not the least bit dry.  Side items were rice and peas (not actually peas but beans) and perfectly cooked sweet plantains.  Service was friendly and the food was more than plentiful.

I will definitely be back on a weekly basis.  Can't wait to try the Oxtails and Curry Goat.  

If you enjoy Jamacan food, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place. Food is amazing. Definitely fills the void after being to Jamaica."}
{"text":"I love Jamaican food.  Caribbean food in general is one of my favorite cuisines.  Some of the best meals I have had were home-cooked by Jamaicans, Puerto Ricans, Trinidadians, and Guayanans.  Unfortunately, Phoenix is nearly bereft of cuisine from this part of the world.  For Jamaican food, you really have the upscale, and barely authentic, breadfruit, the hole-in-the-wall at Mill and Baseline that may not even be open anymore, and now Jerk Hut.  Jerk Hut is easily the best yet.

To say this place is unassuming is an understatement.  Its dinghy facade is not the most inviting exterior you have seen, but don't worry, the people inside are really friendly.

The way this place works is you pick which main course you want (from a menu that changes regularly), and whether you want steamed cabbage and rice and peas on the side.  Sometimes if you're lucky, they'll also have plantains.

I have been here three times, and have had the curry goat, fricassee chicken, and jerk chicken.  All are delicious; you can't go wrong with any of these.  If you haven't had curry goat, try it.  If they have the fricassee chicken, try it.  Really, it's all delicious.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try their ox tail yet; they said they have had a difficult time getting a reliable supply.  It's OK, since they always have the curry goat, curry chicken, and jerk chicken, so the trip will never be a waste - but maybe one day I'll arrive and be pleasantly surprised with delicious ox tail.

For beverages, they have cola champagne and Jamaican ginger beer, which are a must to accompany a good island meal.  Unfortunately no sorrel.

Jerk Hut is great food, and a lovable hole-in-the-wall local ethnic restaurant.  Quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Fun place but pricey. We paid $15 each for a small amount of chicken and a bunch of rice in a styrofoam box. But the food was what we thought it would be and the owner was very nice."}
{"text":"When I first came here a couple of years ago I honestly had planned to eat here regularly (see my previous review ca. 2012), but that didn't happen. It's not that the food isn't tasty or fairly unique to the area, it's simply that it's too expensive. An oxtail meat lunch costs $18 - I LOVE oxtail but simply refuse to pay that much money for it. Things like goat meat etc are well over $10. For a simple jerk chicken lunch along with a meat patty and can of Coke (no diet drinks available) I was out just over $17. It's gotten more expensive since the last time I was here. I call this the \"Mrs White's Golden Rule\" effect. Sure as hell hope the food quality doesn't also decline inversely with the price hike, such as what happened at Golden Rule.

And honestly that's pretty much it. Great tasting food, and you get a decent amount of rice and peas, it just costs too much. I'd be here at least once a week if they had lunch specials for ten bucks and under (you know, like at Fired Pie - which allows you as many pizza toppings as you like for the same sub-ten-buck total price), but as it stands it's just not affordable. Oh, and good luck finding parking - there's basically five spots available behind the store.

Tiny place too, I'd say max ten people seated, and that's elbow to elbow."}
{"text":"Bomba! Wow.. I'm here eating while I draft this review. Don't sleep on this place!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Jamaican food, however somewhat pricey. I went there for lunch and got the Oxtail meal which was $19, that plus a drink I ended up paying $23 for a lunch.

The oxtail was good however I've had better for cheaper prices. The plantains were too greasy for me and not good, which was a disappointment since they are one of my favorites pieces of Jamaican cuisine. 

If it was cheaper I would probably be back sooner, however at the $23 price range for average food I probably won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambience of this place. The staff was very inviting and warming when I enter. Jamaican food has always been a big part of my life growing up. So I know what it suppose to taste like. So far so good the jerk
 chicken is a must have. With a great mix of spices it will leave your mouth watering. What a great job by jerk hut. Defiantly hard to find good Jamaican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great authentic Carib food. Loved the Ox-tail and Peas and Rice. You don't get a lot of Ox-tail for the price so beware. Friendly staff, and small space, but yummy food!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place shortly before closing to pick up some jerk chicken. Everyone was extremely friendly and tended to me promptly. 
It's a hole in the wall. But aren't those the places that usually have the best food? Yes! They hit it spot on with their authentic cuisine. I had the jerk chicken, steamed cabbage and rice. It was a bit pricey but the portions were huge! I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I had to join yelp to write a review about this place!!!
I drove from Scottsdale just to get some  jamaican food. . and it was well worth the drive..I ordered the oxtail on a bed of white rice and plantain. The food was spot on... from the flavor and tenderness. . it was Perfect... if your are looking for a fancy sit down restaurant this might not be the place as they have very limited seating..but if it's good jamaican food you want. . look no further"}
{"text":"There are very few places who can get me to eat chicken that is not boneless/skinless and this is one of them! Not only can they get me to eat it, the jerk chicken here can get me to drive across town on my lunch hour just to indulge. Generous portions of juicy, tender, flavorful chicken piled in one corner of a styrofoam take out tray partnered with loads of rice (flavors vary, for example: rice and beans or pumpkin rice) and your choice of plantains or (my choice) steamed cabbage for about $10 with a drink. The cabbage is still crisp and firm and a nice, mild crunch to go with the rest of the meal. The staff is incredibly friendly. Seating is very limited (stools facing a narrow counter that runs the perimeter of the small restaurant's space) -- but, in a way that makes it convenient to eat alone and be left to stuff your face! 

BYO wet wipes though, fair warning!"}
{"text":"they. have. Ting. regular AND pink. i think i just died and went to Jamaican food heaven!

my brother brought me here for lunch one day as we are jamaican food fanatics. the Oxtail? oh man. i think i just died a little, it was so good. SO GOOOOOOD. it may be the best oxtail i've ever had! i only wish that the portions were a wee bit larger, meat-wise. Yum. I literally scraped my dish clean. I would have licked it, but licking styrofoam makes you look desperate. 

brother had the goat curry, which was delicious as well. 

My only request - more side options, please! Rice and peas is considered a side.

we will be back!"}
{"text":"Jamaican food is not my favorite, but after reading reviews and driving by many times my wife and I made it a point to try the Jerk Hut out.  I am glad we did.

The food reminded me of our recent trip to Jamaica, as did the building, parking lot and staff, complete \"ya man no problem\" vibe.  I enjoyed the oxtail with plantains on the side (not a huge fan of plantains either, but enjoyed and will order again).  My wife had the Jerk Chicken and after tasting it we were both in agreement that we would order it again.  

The Jerk Hut is a nice change from the norm and should not be overlooked."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The food is fantastic; like a trip to the Blue Mountains & the staff, lead by the charming owner wonderful. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"I'm not close to Jamaican, nor am i an expert in their culture but i do know how much love i have for their \"items\". My boy Brian T (below) got a door hanger for this new Jerk Chicken spot close to home, and was telling me all about it as we were sipping some mojitos at RumBar with the owner of RB. Well, of course he chimed in, and the 2 of them decided to tell me that i needed to try it Stat. Next day, off i went for lunch. Walked in right as they opened, and was immediately greeted by (i assume) the owner. extremely nice man. he was filling the cooler up with water, and his young daughter was helping out. His mom (i know cause he said \"mah\") rung me up, and (i assume again) his wife made me my food. Is there anything better then supporting a local, family owned and operated business that ALSO has 5 star food and service??? nope!!! Jerk chicken wasn't dry, wasn't too spicy (the hotter the better, just like all things in life ;). The location looks dicey, but use the back door VIP style and your set up for the promise land. quick, convenient, tasty, and all under a polite roof. so good."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open up, and finally made our way over there.  We were immediately greeted by an aroma of spices, and were offered samples of everything on the  menu.  Everything is already made and ready to eat, which is great because everything tasted so good.  Nothing disappointed! My husband, brother-in-law and I each ordered different menu items (jerk chicken, curry chicken, and fricassee chicken) with the special rice, and had Jamaican sodas that were recommended by Marie (I think that was her name).  The menu is small, but really well done.  We were told that they will expand the menu when they can get more customers.  With such great food and service, I hope this place gets the chance to stick around! 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMM GIMMIE THAT!!

This place is good! i got the Jerk Chicken.. and i was thinkn as i was eating this, yeah it could be spicier, but then i took a bite of a part that was filled with the spices/marinade, and yes. I was happy.

let me take it back to the beginning for you....

I was driving up 19th with full intention of coming to the Jerk Hut to get my grub on. I started to drive a little bit slower so i could spot the place. (its on the North east side).. I slip into the back where it says \"parking entrance\" (it also is the exit too so watch out!). 

Well i look to my right and it looks kinda shady back there, but i think whatever i won't be in there too long. I park and start to walk around the front. I hear a voice come from one of the doors, you can just walk through the backs of the businesses. I notice it is coming from the far left side (the door for the jerk hut) and so i proceed to come over. The guy greets me with a thick accent and says, \"you are going to the jerk hut? this is the door for the jerk hut\"... I said yes with a big smile and proceed because i can definitely tell where the jerk hut is (follow your nose toucan sam).. I enter into a what i was expecting to be a little run down shop. Nope...super clean, everything is newly finished. I walk in and am greeted by the cashier/server...

I order my jerk chicken, she recommends different sides to go with my food...I obviously accept because who wouldn't take (who i think was a co-owner) advice. Well yes! i landed the Jerk chicken, fried plantains, the bean rice with gravy...MMMMMMMMM i want more and i just finished eating there. Needless to say, i should have asked for more gravy ontop of my rice cause that made it 100x's better... yes 100 times, i calculated it...

I get a jamaican soda to go with my meal...yes it all hit the spot. True story its a little pricey.  jerk chicken meal and soda ran me up to 13 dollars. (it was a specialty soda so that prolly helped out my total).  if you just get the meal (no drink) you will be around 10 dollars..but to be honest, just get the drink

Anyways if you don't like this place i have to say you must be a vegitarian....and to that i say...sucks for you cause this place's jerk chicken was bomb diggity no doubt...

Now here is the question people always want to know...Will you be back??


Yes i will be back...tomorrow actually so i can try the ox tail... that good twice in a week..maybe more if i got paid more .. #iwantaraise"}
{"text":"I love the food , but this place opens when they want to. i have driven there several times only to find them closed!!!!! seems like they make there own hours."}
{"text":"Feels like home. I love the jerk chicken here. They also have Jamaican drinks available for purchase. Pretty good overall!

The place is sort of small with limited parking. The bathroom still freaks me out because it's super dark but the food makes up for it. The owner is almost, always there and he's pretty awesome at suggesting you on what to try. The price is a little high but the food is delicious enough to remind me of home made food."}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about this place.  Definitely follow everyone's directions on how to find the place.  The parking is in the back and for those who are squeemish, it's not the best part of the neighborhood.  But for those who don't care - charge on.
The guys/owners were really nice when I came in. A meal is one meat with two sides. I was debating whether to get the jerk chicken or the goat curry so the guy suggested I get both - the second meat would be my side. Well when I went to pay, the bill came out to $21!!!  I had a feeling that it would be slightly more b/c I got two meats.  That's not what upset me.  It was the fact that he FAILED to mention that it was extra.  i figured a few dollars more but it was $7 more.  I thought that should have been significant enough to mention in the beginning.  Not right when I am paying.  That is my only gripe - not mentioning it.  Maybe it's b/c I am a girl they figured they didn't have to?  hmm...  I asked them what was the price difference and they explained it but didn't seem to notice my surprise. In looking at the receipt, they charged me for the goat curry (higher price) and then the extra for the chicken.

But overall everyone is right - the food was really good.  So much flavor in both meats.  A bit salty or lots of msg maybe b/c I was chugging water afterwards.   But it was definitely good.  

So yes, I'd love to go back - the food was great and I could care less about the ambiance, but I wasn't happy about the failing to mention the big difference in pricing..."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to order the Oxtail with a side of cabbage but they were out of both.  (I ordered late, like at 7:30 PM)  That's ok, I tried the Goat Curry.  It was awesome! 

The best part about the visit was the friendly customer service.  They were very welcoming!  It felt like friends and family, welcoming us in to their home and showed us where to park and what door to use.  Their credit card machine was down and I didn't have cash.... They gave the food to me anyway!  WOW!  With a handshake, they said \"we know you're good for it\" and sent us on our way with their delicious food.  I will definately be back and will make good on our transaction.  What WONDERFUL people who operate the Jerk Hut and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is one of my favorite meals. I noticed I had this place bookmarked, and it is close to my work. I decided to finally check it out. The parking was a little challenging as it shares a parking lot with a tattoo shop and there are only a few spots behind the store. Walking inside it was small - a couple of tables up front and a row of seats down the a bar against the wall. 

The man behind the counter was very friendly and when he asked if it was my first time there he walked me through it and made some recommendations. I had the jerk chicken, two styles of rice with \"gravy\", cabbage, and a couple plantains. I picked up a bottle of Ting as well. 

The chicken was flavorful, not too spicy, and the sides were excellent. While eating another gentleman came up and asked how I liked it. He was very polite and asked if I needed anything else. I saw a plaque stating they won 2013 Best Jerk award, and I can't disagree. It was one of the top that I have had. 

The food was great, the service even better. The one thing I would change is the music. They had a local radio station playing, but I would prefer to hear reggae while eat Jamaican food - make it a total experience. The club music just didn't fit. 
Being that close to work and a good experience, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These folks really love the food they cook. I like the attention to quality- fresh whole herbs, not from a bottle; Lazzari coal to grill their meat;good quality goat meat, not stringy. It's not cheap, it's a little slow, but it's all so delicious."}
{"text":"Three times I've visited Jerk Hut and from what I can tell, the taste of the food depends on who's cooking that particular day.  

Upon your entrance, you'll see most of the food already cooked and sitting in warmers but they always have newer batches of hot pots on the stove behind the counter in order to replenish the warmers.  They'll also make-to-order for your privilege.  

My first visit, I got to try the three meat dishes: jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail stew.
All were tasty, but I was partial to the chicken.  It's made mild and offered with much hotter jerk sauce if that's your pleasure.  The steamed veggies tasted good as well and the plantains were delicious.  

Unfortunately, the dessert wasn't like anything I've tasted before and struck out  unpleasantly.   Won't ever ask for dessert again.

Jerk chicken - 1
Dessert - 0

My second visit, I got to the fish: steamed snapper, fried tilapia.  Both were decent dishes.  The snapper was a whole fish made to order and cost \"market price,\" the tilapia was prix fixe and served as small lightly breaded filets.  

I also requested a veggie stew which the cook made fresh from carrots, cabbage, and coconut milk.  It was creamy, perfectly spicy (not burning), and tasted wonderful.  Home run.

Tilapia - 1
Veggie stew - 1

The price wasn't so wonderful though.  I asked to substitute stewed veggies for the prepared steamed veggie side.  Nope - apparently we were on different menus, I was later told that the stew is a separate dish.  So I gave up $20 for the tilapia and veggie stew.  It's all right though, I made two meals out that portion.  Leftovers were even more yummy the next day.

Lesson noted: get a price quote before making substitutions.  The guy behind the counter will say, \"I'll take care of it\" and by the time he's rung up your bill, you're like - HOW MUCH?!

Food on the third visit to Jerk Hut Jamaican Grille was not good at all.  I noticed a different cook and was hesitant, but I manned-up and ordered take out anyway.  Veggie stew and plantains please.  

I was given extra plantain wedges this time which would usually make me jump for joy, because the fruit is one of my fave foods.  But when I got home, one bite in and, yuck.  Those wedges were soggy, greasy, gelatinous things.  

It seems they had used sweet ripe plantains and overcooked them.  (In my opinion, sweet ripe plantains should be baked, leave the frying for the unripe starchy ones.)  Like any other food that's overcooked, the plantains grew less and less appealing every minute they sat in the warmer.  I did not eat them.

On to the stew.  First look - the carrots and cabbage were covered in clumps of butter and coconut milk and I couldn't even bite into it yet.  It took a couple of rinses under the tap to get the clumps out, but so went a lot of the flavor too.  

Plantains - 0   
Veggie Stew - 0"}
{"text":"Authentic Jamaican food and I can say it's one of the best in Phoenix. I just ordered the oxtail and the meat is so juicy but i also think that it is over priced. How can you charge someone $20 for a plate food and you're not a high class restaurant. I would recommend to come here at least once every couple months due the price. For some reason they never have beef patties when I come which is very disappointing."}
{"text":"Place wasn't even opened as it was posted on the website really disappointing and a extreme way to waste your gas can't rate the place an overview 1 star due to the failed operating times that were posted and us located in a harsh spot of Phoenix"}
{"text":"This place gave me the runs....literally...straight to the bathroom after I ate this slop. I should have known better...My spidey senses was telling me to leave..but no, I stayed just because I've been craving, jonesing for Caribbean food. So I placed my order, I had Curry chicken, rice and peas and cabbage. I declined the plantains, it seemed the flies enjoyed it better than me. They were having a blast swarming over the plantains. I paid something like $10.95...which in my opinion was too much considering the proportions don't match the price. The taste was just ok...not the worst..but not the best either. The cabbage was pretty good though. The food seemed old too..if I had to bet $20..that food probably was cooked yesterday cause the kitchen did not look cooked in. I feel like a sucka reading these damn reviews thinking I was gonna get a good meal...I don't know where the hell these folks who left reviews ate at..it sure as hell doesn't seems like its this place. Maybe I came at the wrong time. My 1st time sucked....and my bubbling stomach thinks so too. 2 thumbs down and a wtf."}
{"text":"Taste wise 4 star, as the food does taste good, service 4 star the guy working the counter was very nice. I would give an overall of a 4 star, but gave 3 due mainly 2 price, and as good as the food is, u really do not get very much meat with your food. They do give you plenty of rice/beans with your food, a decent amount of plantains, but very little chicken for what they charge. Overall if the price ever drops, I will absolutely go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am not that versed in Caribbean cuisine, but if this is a true representation of the that region then I am going to try and seek out all that I can experience. I have been to this place quite a few times but this is my first on Yelp with them. First of all the staff at the place is so friendly and nice. Always helpful and super courteous. I have only had three dishes from here, the Jerk Chicken, Chicken Fricasee, and Goat Curry. And I must say typing those words made my mouth water. The sweet and spicy herbs and spices they use on the Fricasee and the Jerk are so delicious and complex that as a former chef I am enthralled with how they come up with such flavors. When you oder a meal you get a choice of white rice or red beans and rice. Then you get your choice of gravy on the rice. I always get the Goat Curry gravy. Then there is a nice little surprise of a cabbage mix that is surprisingly hearty and plantains that are cooked perfectly.I will go back to this place over and over. I think the Oxtail soup is next for me to try."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Northern California and our Phoenix hosts, Americans were excited to treat me and their Michigan guest, both of us Jamaicans to Jamaican food in Phoenix.  Their first choice was Breafruit Rum.  After being insulted for bringing a 5 year old to an \"adult\" restaurant, our Phoenix hosts decided to take us to Jerk Hut.  What a difference! We were immediately greeted with a warm smile and hearty welcome by Trevor who was up front taking orders, serving and cashiering.  Behind him was Lloyd who did the cooking another bright smile and welcome.  We had clearly made the right decision to walk out of Breadfruit Rum.  We got delicious authentic Jamaican cuisine, bright Jamaican smile and down home hospitality.  I had the curry goat with rice N peas and steam mixed vegetables.   My Michigan friend had the jerk chicken.  Our Phoenix host, had the escoveitch fish and ox tail. I forgot to mention I started with a Royal Caribbean beef patty and topped off with sweet potato pudding. Not only was the food superb, but the warm Jamaican spirit and love was all over the food and the restaurant.  And did I mention the spirited discussion about our homeland vs where we live - USA?  These gents clearly wanted our business.  And the 5 year old that Breadfruit could not and would not accommodate!  He got plain white rice for his appetizer while Chef Lloyd did a special batch of friend chicken for him.  It was \"no problem\" for them to accommodate us. If you want a warm welcoming environment, superb authentic Jamaican food and the Jamaican hospitality, go to the Jerk Hut.  Great place!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!  Good Jamaican food in Phoenix!  Where I'm from (the boogie down Bronx), Jamaican food is a staple in our diets, and there's a Jamaican spot on every corner.  So I'm always skeptical when a Jamaican place pops up in Phoenix. Jerk Hut is the first place that actually serves authentic Jamaican food, in my opinion.  I'd been wanting to try this place for a while, but I bookmarked them on Yelp and liked their Facebook page in the meantime.  Today, they posted on Facebook that their special is escovitch, and seeing as how I love me some escovitch, I made my way over there for lunch.  

It's easy to miss (I did).  It's on the NE corner of 19th Avenue and Indian School, and depending on your angle, it's kind of hidden behind the bus stop shelter.  There's limited parking in the back (which looks a little sketchy), but I'll take that chance for good food.  The interior is very unexpected -- clean and updated with an island vibe, but it's very small.  Only a couple of tables, and a long bar with chairs.  The gentleman who helped me was very pleasant, with a big smile and a Jamaican accent. 

I ordered my escovitch, with red beans and rice and plantains on the side.  The escovitch was delicious and spicy (my mouth is still on fire as I type this)! The veggies on top set it off, absolutely terrific!  The red beans with curry gravy on top were perfectly cooked, as were the plantains, which were deliciously soft and sweet. I also ordered a beef patty (they didn't have any coco bread at the time) to test it out, and it's just okay -- the beef was a little mushy and the crust not as flakey as I like.  Definitely not as good as the ones back home, and I'd be surprised if they are actually made in house.  

I'll definitely be back for another visit!  I want to try the jerk chicken next."}
