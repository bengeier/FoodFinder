{"text":"Nice, friendly service. Tasty fried chicken similar to what we have in Korea. Fancy mugs and pitchers which are lit up with multi-coloured LEDs.  It is a small venue which feels very comfortable and relaxed. Four televisions display the latest K-pop videos, sports etc. Great collection of K-pop and Korean ballads to listen to. It's a fun place to book your birthday party."}
{"text":"FERG'S!  It's like Cheers, but in Toronto!

Outside, you see all of these advertisements for beer, nachos, wings, and you think to yourself \"OKAY!  This is going to be your typical bar.\"  Surprise surprise!  You go inside and it's Korean Cheers!

It's usually quiet enough that they are happy to change the channel for you to whatever sporting event you'd like.  People are friendly, though Korean bar food is different than what you might expect.

So many lonely holidays spent here with meow mix, such good memories!

Annyeonghi gaseyo!"}
{"text":"Located on the lower level of the building, Ferg's is a smaller bar that a friend and I dropped in on a late Monday evening. We noticed the menu stated that All You Can Eat Wings were the Monday speciality. The catch? It's served with fries and you must finish your fries as well as the wings. Also, the entire table must order the AYCE. I wasn't that hungry for AYCE but my buddy was, so for around $20 bucks it was not that bad. The wings are battered ala Chinese takeout which is crazy good!

Service was nice, friendly and consistent as well."}
{"text":"Korean Style Fried Chicken has become the only style fried chicken in my life!!! I love coming to this place. Buy a tower of beer for $25 that comes with light up mugs and a whole fried chicken for less then $20. Watching Korean Rap Video's, sometimes i feel like im on a vacation (I pretend im travelling...shhhh)...but yea... Beer will have you talking until the food arrives. They have some very interesting wing sauces that i definately want to try out. By the way, place used to be called Ferg's. Now its called Chicken N Beer."}
{"text":"This is located in the floor below cafe bene.
It's usually not too busy and the music isn't like a typical Korean bar that you can find in the area.
Beer/soju combos are available for around $23."}
{"text":"Chicken & beer... Such a wonderful combination!

We came here on Canada day after watching the fireworks at Mel lastman square. We ordered the Wednesday special ($19.99 whole chicken which includes a basket of fries).

Chicken comes in two flavours: crispy and saucy. I recommend that you go for saucy as long as you don't mind getting your hands messy. Or crispy if you prefer your chicken dry. Both were tasty and fresh.

Super cozy bar. Plenty of TVs for watching sports events. Wonderful friendly service. Complimentary popcorn & olives. This is a really nice bar in the area and I recommend that you check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"My first time went to this place and I wasn't really impressed with it.  This Korean bar is located in the basement level and doesn't really have a big space. They were pretty dark too. I went there with 6 other friends on Saturday night around 6 pm and there weren't many people yet. We ordered 1 whole half & half chicken that came with fries.  The half & half came half with just regular fried chicken without any sauce and the other half is with Korean sauce, which I thought would be spicy,  but apparently not at all for my taste. The portion was not big, unlike other Korean fried chicken place that give you huge portion for whole chicken.  

We also ordered 1 whole Boneless Chicken with Green Onion.  Again,  the amount of food is little and it tasted so-so.  Nothing really special about it.  But one good thing about this place is you can ask for steam rice substitution instead of fries.  Since my friends and I like to eat Korean fried chicken with steam rice,  we substituted the fries with steam rice. 

Some of my friends ordered beer and it came with some popcorn.  I think if you don't order beer,  you won't get popcorn.  Well,  not very sure about it, though.   This place also has some TVs that play sports channels.  Which is good if you're looking for sports bar with Korean food.  

Overall experience it was just so-so,  I don't think I'll be back again for Korean fried chicken.  I'd rather go to other places that taste better.  Although the service wasn't bad.  The lady working there (maybe she's the owner) was pretty nice, but it was only her working at the time I went there."}
{"text":"Small, good, not fancy please. Relaxing atmosphere, not too loud. They are offering nice bar food and tap beer.
Not overpriced. You won't be disappointed if you are just looking for simple small bar in the area."}
