{"text":"What a great new addition to the neighborhood, and in such an unlikely place. Montreal, especially at this time of the year is notorious for cold , damp and gloomy weather.  But the moment we walked into this surprisingly cozy little place below the stairs, the cheery warmth, clean set up and delicious smells  of good things cooking was enough to let us know we'd found another winter-time hide-away. The decor is austere and tasteful, with a single wall mural of a blossom which was beautiful.  The restaurant is kept clean, and there's a television hanging up in the corner for those perfect solo outings when one just has to find solace from a busy world. The two who served us were warm, helpful, and very friendly . The menu I was handed was well-written, printed and had informative pictures and terrific prices. There's a varied assortment of classic offerings from Sashimi to tartare with even an ambitious pizza on the menu.  Their Soya sauce is not overly salty and has a slightly sweet flavor I've come to love and which, to me, shows a good level of care. We ordered avocado rolls which were plump and fresh. The rolls rolls themselves were created skillfully and with care. Rice was fresh, adhered properly to the ingredients, with no ugly gaping spaces.  I'd only suggest that they be careful with ends, as the last bite, should be just as filled with delicious ingredients as the first :) So far we've had the California (fresh and generous with ingredients) the Ebi Folie (deeper flavors with shrimp and masago and a little spicier) and, because we were so happy with what we ate, ordered a third one after we finished, the Kamika, with spicy salmon which hit the spot. So many offerings calling out to us,  pizza and rolls which we are anxious to taste. We will indeed return. Recommended"}
