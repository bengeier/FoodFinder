{"text":"Overall my experience was nothing special. The food is good, but for the price, the portion size, service and overall value was sub-par. The restaurant setting itself is charming, like a small family owned diner/café. I really wanted to like this place. But for same price, I could enjoy a far better meal at Milagro."}
{"text":"It used to be good. A year ago, the service was good and the tacos were fresh. Today, the service is abysmal, the tacos are stale and food over priced. This place will close down soon and unfortunately will deserve it."}
{"text":"A good friend brought me here for dinner and birthday drinks. We sat at the bar and learned all about tequila from the friendliest, loveliest bartender. The menu had attitude: spice and authenticity. We settled on margaritas (with smoked horcata, sweetened with maple syrup) and some tacos. Both were delicious. Service was superb - the chef brought out our dishes and explained their intricacies himself. I'll be back, Fonda Lola!"}
{"text":"A super cute place that's stylish, but still has those authentic Mexican touches. Food is fresh and delicious. Love the cocktails and the owner is very attentive."}
{"text":"I went for dinner last night with my wife and teen children, so pleased with our choice. We ordered the Mexican Fiesta. $100 for every item on the menu. It was a great option for a group of 4 and terrific value. Everyone got to sample every dish and they even accommodated my daughter the pescetarian by splitting the tacos into pork and tofu portions. The guacamole ws so smooth and creamy. Candied bacon (no vegetarian substitute for this) was crisp but the fat still succulent, wickedly spicy but my favourite dish. The Churros in the goat's milk caramel cream was also a favourite."}
{"text":"This beautiful quaint little place has a lovely outdoor patio, and friendly staff. One of my favourite new places. Only caveat is it on pricier side but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"This place has little portions for big bills. There are many better tasting Mexican restaurants on the west side and you won't face over $100 for two people eating tacos !"}
{"text":"The setting was interesting, it has that Queen West hipster kind of feel with interesting decor and an even more interesting set of bath room stalls and copper hand washing basins downstairs. It could perhaps be a nice place for an intimate date but not a first date since the food took over an hour to get to our table (Thursday night, ordered at 720p food arrived at around 830p - a little frustrating)

I had the hand held Caesar salad, pork taco al pastor and the churros while my friend had the pescado al mojo

The hand held Caesar was actually quite delicious and something that I would recommend trying. It is quite garlic-eee and has a bit of kick to it as well. I think the biggest treat is the candied bacon which was quite delicious!

The pork tacos al pastor, while not terrible were very typical - nothing really interesting except for small chunks of pineapple. Definitely expected more. Portion size was also mediocre.

As for my friends pescado al mojo, he mentioned that it was also so-so and portion size was mediocre.

The churros were not bad, however typical and nothing special again.

Overall I was disappointed, primarily due to the long waiting time for food and the 'standard, typical' main dishes. Also, their tables and chairs were really not that comfortable - table legs are very short and my legs were always rammed up against the table.

Anyway, this is my 2 cents."}
{"text":"PARTIAL POST...
The drink menu at Fonda Lola is not surprisingly, Mexican themed, with 4 Margaritas ($10.50), 2 Sangrias ($10), 2 Mojitos ($10), one beer on draft ($6) and VQA wine available only by bottle (at least for now).  With the recent taco craze that has completely overtaken Toronto, there has been no shortage of tequila cocktails going down the hatch. But Fonda Lola's recipes and techniques are unique to say the least. First there's the fresh finger limes that decorate the glass rims and burst on the tongue in an orgasmic sour juice experience. Next, is Fonda Lola's in-house aging system, tequila is being stored in a large barrel for around 6 months, and tapped into right in the dining room. Third, is the addition of locally produced Kombucha (fermented black tea) in a range of fruity and aromatic flavours as a cocktail base. And finally, most intriguing to this dietitian-by-trade, is the substitution of agave (the typical Mexican sweetener) with maple water, a locally made product with significantly lower calorie and sugar stats to yield a healthier concoction. 
The food menu also deviates from the Toronto- taqueria restaurant recipe. While you will certainly find a few tacos (served family style with DIY condiments), there is also a nice range in alternative offerings- from the use of less familiar Mexican ingredients and techniques like Chayote, Aguachile and Epazote, to more playful Mexican approaches to Western favourites (see their take on the Caesar salad below). Health-nuts will also be happy to note the number of vegetarian options, and that 13 of the 14 menu items are naturally gluten free.
Dishes are divided into \"Frio\" (appetizers, snack foods and share plates priced between $5-8), \"Caliente\" (your more substantial offerings at $5-14) and of course there's a Dessert offered for $9. You can also order the entire menu for $100 (and be sure to hashtag #mexicanfiesta when you do!)

Here's a little sampling of what we tried transcribed verbatim to give you a sense of Fonda Lola's cheeky style:

Classic Margarita ($10.50)
Citrus & Tequila

Damn those finger limes know how to spank the ol' tastebuds.

Kombucha Margarita ($10.50)
Smoked Horchata & Tequila

With Ginger Kombucha

With Cherry Kombucha

Both cocktails were deliciously easy to drink, yet distinctly different depending on their kombucha profile. I love the idea of trying a seemingly completely different cocktail every time!

Picante ($10.50)
Honey Dew Melon, Tequila, Home Made Spicy Midori

My favourite. Just enough of a kick in the back of the throat and enough sweet fruit flavour to sooth it. 

Guacamole to Keep You Busy ($5)

Creamy and smooth guac (which is how I prefer it) with crazy addictive corn chips.

Hand Held Caesar ($8)
Legume, Cesar Avocado Mousse, Candied Jalapeno Bacon, Cheese!

Sounds gimmicky maybe to re-imagine such a standard simple people pleaser, but this dish made me question why it isn't always done this way. The creamy avocado, the spicy-sweet-salty bacon, the buttery lettuce cup... Yes, please.

Trout Aguachile ($8)
Rougher & Caliente Version of Ceviche

Wow! I like acid, and this provided a karate chop of bright lime flavour. So fresh, so good.

Candied Bacon ($5)
Pork OK?

Thick cut, good chew, perfectly rendered, and an addictive balance of sweet, salty and heat. Yup.

Panela Popper ($7)
Jalapeno Marinated Panela Cheese, Coated in Corn Meal

If you like cheese without too much distraction, then these are the poppers for you. Light and crispy on the outside and packed with semi-chewy- semi- gooey goodness, and a kick from the jalapeno marinade. 

Taco al Pastor ($10)
Pork, Beef & Veg Option

Served family style with warm tortillas, tomatillo salsa, and hibiscus-marinated jalapenos, the idea is to share and dress your tacos as you please. I tried all three fillings, and each was perfectly cooked, seasoned flawlessly and topped with the most impossibly sweet caramelized pineapple. Oh, and those hibiscus jalapenos? Pack me up a bottle of those and I will call it dinner. 

Spiced Churros con Cajeta ($9)

Some of the best churros I've ever had. Light and crispy exterior, pillowy soft centre, coated generously in an unconventional mixture of cinnamon, sugar, salt and three different peppers. The result is a pleasant juxtaposition with the sweet and satiny goats milk cajeta whipped cream base."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived early for our party of 10 and we enjoyed our time grabbing drinks at the bar while we waited. I ordered a kombucha sangria which tasted like a healthy glass of juice. My friend had a citrus margarita with this exotic finger lime. The bartender was patient and friendly when he explained the drinks and that made us all the more excited about our choices. 

When our party arrived, we were seated in the patio which looks like a funky backyard. Sadly, this was the last of my good experience at Fonda Lola.

I had mixed feelings about the food. I enjoyed the panela poppers, which were little cubes of breaded cheese in tomato sauce. However, the guacamole was bland and the churro was nothing special. 

What really stood out was the service (or lack thereof). Our server made us feel very unwelcome by quickly removing our plates before asking if we were finished and ignoring our flags that we wanted more food. What was unacceptable was her rude behaviour when settling the bill. From what I read of other reviews, our experience was not unique. 

I would not recommend this restaurant because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Was not too happy here recently.  Bar had no cold beer, 1 bottle of wine (when that was gone they had no more).  The food was okay, it really was okay and no better than okay.  Specifics:  

- Guacamole portion was very small (lots of home made chips though which was good).  
- Beef soft tacos were okay.  Exact same style meat as Chipotle which was surprising.
- Fried cheese squares were like pub food.  I like that, but it's not at their price.
- Churros were good, but they always are.  I'd suggest Panchos in Kensington instead.

But wait.... our unnoticed 33% tip!

We ended up tipping 33% by mistake ($110) because 18% was added to our party (which is fine), however we didn't notice this when we paid and added an additional 15% tip.  Asked the waitress to refund our additional 15% and she showed us the terminal and suggested that no extra tip was added.  If you've ever been a server you ALWAYS know exactly what you've been tipped (especially if it's this large), we are thankful that we dug deeper into their POS and double-checked the bill.  In my opinion our server should have pointed this abnormal tip out."}
{"text":"Great new little Mexican joint. It was so easy to make reservations. You can text message their number which makes it easy to communicate when there is a change to your party. The staff were really friendly and the food was great. Definitely unlike the typical dirty Mexican food that comes up to mind when you think Mexican cuisine. We were a party of 7 so we decided to get the Mexican fiesta (the whole menu for 100$). The waiter insisted we get 3 or 4 because a couple could share a Mexican fiesta on their own. We decided to only get 2 so we can try everything before we ordered more. Thank god we did because there was so much food between us, we insisted that they don't bring out an order of food they had missed. I suggest 1 Mexican fiesta for 4 people.  I would come back here again if just for their hand held Caesar wraps."}
{"text":"In the nicest way possible....

Pros

1. Cute decor
2. Intimate setting
3. Service was friendly
4. There really is only 3 pros

Cons

1. Bland food
2. $11 Caesar salad was nothing to get too excited about...it's chopped lettuce served in lettuce.
3. Drinks are pricey for what they are.
4. The carnitas were served alone with no toppings....dry
5. Tasteless fish tacos
6. $80 bill for 3 small plates.  Ended up going to the saint and had the winterlicious dinner to fill up. 
7. Not sure if this qualifies as a con but....a gratuity was suggested at 44%! Haha we laughed...a little comedic relief

Enjoy! (Or not)"}
{"text":"3/5! This is a cute and authentic place but given the new mexican places that have recently opened, I was rather disappointed in the food. we went for the $30 tasting menu and had the option to try everything on the menu. My favourites were the fried bacon, lettuce wraps trour ceviche and steak tartare. I disagree with a lot of the reviews as I thought tt was too much food (if you do the $30 option)."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant was great ! Delicious margarita, Huevo Rancheros and service was friendly.  However, my second visit was a big disappointment.  I guess the staff were recovering from a party the night before and could not hold it together for their customers.  Bad service - unprofessional.  Food was a real let down.  My 4 other guests which were trying this place for the first time may never go back.  I have been left with a troubling impression ..."}
{"text":"I tried to reach out to this restaurant via email, but no one wrote back. So, I am using Yelp. I really had one of the worst meals ever. 

My daughter was given the name of your restaurant by a friend who raved about it - clearly they had never had brunch there. We were looking forward to Mexican food when we went to Fonda Lola, but were told that there is only a brunch menu on Sunday. We thought we'd try it. 

My daughter now knows the word \"non-descript\" - which is what my sandwich tasted like. The \"chef\" was out of the pork for the sandwich and offered chicken. It was disgusting. The dark meat morsels were swimming in red oil, which clearly made the bread soggy. The lettuce leaves were lifeless.  My daughter's egg tacos were also less than desirable. Maybe Toronto just doesn't know Mexican. The whole meal was gross and I have never written an email like this. 

There were two tables of two on the patio (the only nice thing about our lunch) and yet the waitress was never around. 

I would not recommend this restaurant for brunch - HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I had the Taco de Pulpo al Ajillo and they were amazing. Really yummy and not something you can order every where. Drinks were also great. Over all a good spot, but prices a bit too high for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Love the healthy light Mexican and the fact that you can get Vans Kombucha....waitress is super friendly and patient.  Food came out super quick :)"}
{"text":"6 of us dined here on a Saturday night and did the 'mexican fiesta'. As it is normally for 4 people, we added 2 more people for $38 each. We were excited to try many different things. 

Food
-The food was okay, some things better then others. The guacamole had a nice spice to it, the poppers were yummy (how can deep fried cheese not be?), the Caesar salad tacos were very flavourful and the tofu tacos were unique and tasty. None of the meat was memorable. The drinks were good but the sangria was very syrupy and tasted somewhat artificial. 

Experience
-The restaurant was busy and 6 of us were crammed into a 4 person table and it was tight. Our waitress forgot some of the food which we had to remind her to bring. And when we asked about another dish that was not brought out to the table she said they ran out of it. I think if we didn't ask it would have not been mentioned. She did not offer to bring us something else which we thought was weird considering we were paying a price to taste the whole menu and expected a certain number of dishes. Someone in our party asked what we will be getting instead to which she said a cheese plate which from what we could tell was already included in our tasting menu so we felt like we were down a course. This would not have been a problem if the portions were satisfactory but they were not. Each of us left the restaurant hungry. We feel that maybe they did not actually increase the portion size based on 6 people but did it based on 4. There was simply not enough food.

I would not suggest the mexican fiesta, even though it was nice to try everything there was simply not enough food for all. I do think the restaurant is worth a try as some of the dishes were good but in my opinion not comparable to other mexican toronto go-tos. 

All in all, each person owed $68 which included a drink each and 20% included gratuity for a table of 6.

The night ended on a sweet note as the churros were yummy."}
{"text":"Preggo mamas be aware! 
Heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try; we get to the restaurant and wait to be seated. We let them know of our reservation only to be offered a table at the bar!! That made no sense to me as we had a reservation and were expected to be given a table for 2 and not bar seating. When we requested for table seating, since my wife was pregnant, the request was declined with no attempt to even find possible options for seating us instead 'a take it or leave it attitude!' 

We decided to take our dinner plans elsewhere. What a shame for a restaurant that does not know how to honor dinner reservations!"}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I arranged a dinner here for a birthday and unfortunately, it was a miserable experience. Something has happened - a change in ownership, or a staff revolt - that has rendered this place non-functional. It's too bad, because Fonda Lola has a ton of potential to be a more upscale spot for Mexican food in the city. 

Though the bright side of the place is their range of tasty cocktails, the food arrived on a strange schedule and was frugal and bland. We ordered about 5 plates of guacamole which though good enough, came out in tiny spoonfuls for $9. The mains we ordered came out incredibly slowly from the kitchen. One friend got her meal first, and then 10 minutes later a few others got theirs. Finally, the birthday girl's meal came out another 20 minutes afterward after reminding the server. The tacos were stale and cold, and meat dishes greasy and in tiny portions. 

When it came time to pay the bill, they were unable to separate us for it, and unwilling to compensate for what they admitted was poor service. I don't know how long they'll be around at this rate (the place was empty on a Thursday night) so it may be a lost cause at this point, but I'd love to see things turn around."}
{"text":"We went to Fonda Lola last night as a party of 10 guests and had the $40 tasting meal.

+ First off, the drink I had was a basil mojito and that very good!

I can't really have the same enthusiasm for the food.  The food quality was good, but the taste was just not there for me.  I've had better in the city.  The nachos were good, but more guacamole was needed on the plate to finish the nachos.  Each taco that I had (carnitas, fish, steak) was bland... even with the accoutrements.  Their version of Caesar salad was the opposite of bland and actually had WAY too much garlic.  And finally the Dulche do Leche cake was just okay.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to have their proper version of churro (we had some sort of event cake), which I understand is normally very good.

+  The jalapeño candied bacon is awesome and stands out from the entire meal for me.  It was the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and spicy.  Thumbs up here.

As for the service, the gentleman was very nice... I think it may have been Andreas Marquez.  He was very hospitable for us, but everything felt a bit rushed.  There were plates that we didn't finish and they were taken off our tables, including the steak, which had 1/4 plate meat left!  That is a HUGE no-no in my books.  It was rushed off to the kitchen before we could say anything; we should have been asked if we wanted to finish.

And finally, their machine wasn't working, and we needed to bring cash.  Not a big deal, but added on top of the rest of glitches, it didn't leave for the best dining experience.  Thankfully, our group was a good one and we were able to have fun anyways.  

Anyways, the experience wasn't bad... it was okay.  Perhaps a function of bringing in 10 people for a meal (?)."}
{"text":"Truly authentic, unpretentious, and very cool. Everything you'd expect from the ossington scene. The drinks are different in a great way, not full of sugar like most places. The fish tacos are the best yet I've had in the city, the quesadillas are fantastic and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I ate at Fonda Lola with a friend after hearing about it relentlessly. I really, truly like Mexican food of all stripes, and was super stoked to find out what made Fonda Lola stick out so vividly from all the other places in town, some of which are really damn good!

I was disappointed constantly. I'll start with the good: for tapas-style Mexican on West Queen West, Fonda Lola's prices are reasonable. 

Cool! Now, unfortunately, on with the bad.

Take all the things you would expect from Mexican food - fresh flavours, spice that isn't just there for heat, the boldness of drinks - and replace them with a muted shrug of a cuisine. That's Fonda Lola's recipe. For the life of me, I can't remember a single bite of anything I had.

The trout aguachile (ceviche, more or less) was a bunch of nothingness except for the lime it was marinated in, which landed, all at once, on an oppressively sour note without anything with which to balance it. The Carne Asada was flank steak served rare and cut incompetently; you were supposed to make tacos of it. For all the chewing I did on the undercooked meat, I expected to figure out where the advertised mole came into the dish. Maybe I read the menu wrong? Maybe I was tricked? There was only steak (rare), dry tortilla, equally forgettable toppings, and the faint memory that this should be something more.

The first dish we had was also the most indicative of how deeply messed up the cooking is at Fonda Lola: guacamole! An $8 order comes with tortilla chips. Don't quote me on this, but I think it was also topped off with salsa verde. So there you have it: what should be two of the most powerfully flavourful Mexican toppings, placed on a tortilla chip, and the tortilla chip won out as both (a) tastier and (b) actually tasting like anything at all.

\"Taste\" and \"flavour\" are often wiggle words that reviewers use to cover up their biases, and to hide their inexperience with a certain level of bullshit. That's fine. I'm no restaurant reviewer (alas, here I am reviewing Fonda Lola, but it's more as a PSA). What I think I know well is guacamole. And I'm biased towards the citrusy sort, I like that a lot! But I also know it can be awfully good as a savoury dish, too. Texturally it can be just as diverse and complex.

None of the things that a guacamole can do well were done by Fonda Lola's guacamole, and I can say that with confidence. It was a nothing of a dish - and everything else on the menu followed up on that. Actually, the only thing that stood out the whole night was the dab of sour cream in the rice and beans. It brought those few ingredients together in a way that reminded me that yes, Mexican food can be really damn tasty. 

Then the server took my plate away while I was in the washroom, as the next seating was a mere 25 minutes away, and so I was left to wonder if that dish, too, was but a dream.

In reading other people's reviews and Fonda Lola's self-description, maybe I should have had different expectations. Maybe I should have gone just for some margaritas, or prepared myself for \"lighter, healthier Mexican.\" Sure. But Chef Howard - is that who's still running the kitchen? - should know that Mexican food offers way more than that. You can leave fat out completely and deliver on flavour, with no compromises. You can serve a completely vegan Mexican meal and never leave anyone wondering if the chips were the tastiest part of their last hour and a half. You can do a lot, and they ought to do a lot more.

Don't go. Please, please give your money and attention to any other establishment. I've never been so thoroughly disappointed by a dining experience, and yet people still were showing up by the carload."}
{"text":"I spent my Cinco De Mayo birthday at Fonda Lola and what a night it was. Andres was an incredible host providing me with my very own piñata. The Caesar salad wraps are by far my fave and the drinks were a creative tasty concoction. That evening it was a prix fixe menu, but everything was delicious. I have been back since and the hospitality is always amazing."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Went earlier in the summer and had a great experience, went back the other night and it was awful. Tamarind margaritas were the only reason I'm giving a star and even then, the bartender played with  and twirled and her long hair the entire time she made my drinks so it was kind of gross. Husbands beer was frozen. They replaced with a slightly less frozen beer.

Caesar salad wraps were lemony and bland; they use green leaf lettuce for the wrap which is too big and floppy and the salad had almost no flavour.

Guacamole had to be sent back on account of the chips (which were cold, that's fine) dripping with grease. Guacamole was flavourless and watery and about a 1/8 cup serving. Awful.

Fish tacos previously served on a platter with cabbage, some kind of chipotle sauce and fish pieces + tortillas. Came out premade, tortillas so stale they were falling apart (tip to FL: No Frills tortillas need to be individually reheated in a pan order to be edible). Fish was so bland there wasn't even salt or pepper on it.

Really, really disappointing. The lack of interest from the staff, their attempts to clear while we were still eating, the whole process of calling to reserve (guy was indifferent, seemed surprised we were calling hung up without saying goodbye or confirming we had a table even through Open Table said they were full.)

Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Decided to check it out for dinner last night with a couple of friends.  It's a rather small restaurant with a nice patio in the back.  Decor is fun, sort of  rustic Mexican.  

We ordered the: panela poppers, hand held Cesar salad (to die for!) chips and guac, pork tacos al pastor, the cod and churros (mmm gimme some more!).  The menu is limited but I enjoyed everything we ate.  The tacos were ok but the real stars of the show were the hand held Cesar wraps and the churros. 

Cocktails are delish and made strong so totally worth every penny.  The smoked Cuba libre was amazing and an interesting twist on a classic.  The smoked coke is served in a fun beaker bottle with cork stop and delivered to you with smoke still in the bottle.

Service was awesome and they are so accommodating.  We sat on the back patio and it started to pour and were able to snag a table inside no problem.  I didn't really like one of the drinks I ordered and our server swapped it out for me easy.  We ordered a second round of the hand held Cesars (they're that good!) and because there was a little confusion between our move from outdoor to indoor our order was delayed and in the end they didn't bill us for it due to the wait.

Overall it was a wonderful evening and can't wait to come back.

Ps - did I mention they were playing 90's hip hop?! :)"}

Servings were the perfect size. Did I mention they refill your tortillas for no extra charge???? Love that! 

Came here for brunch. Had their freshly squeezed non-alcoholic  drinks. Started off with their guac. Ate their huevos rancheros as my main and finished off with churros. Did ya see my pictures from my meal??? Made me want to lick my screen remember how food everything tasted! Lol"}
{"text":"Great meal and the vibe was really chill. This place does 


The panella poppers were definitely my favorite thing, kind of a schmancy jalapeños  popper. Lobster taco things that were also amazing."}
{"text":"Meh.  Tapas sized dishes for $12.  Three tiny pork tacos with no garnish, just literally pork and some corn.  Only beer available when we were there was steamwhistle.  Dishes were tiny so if you go - you will have to order at least two $12 dishes to have a meal - which would be fine if he menu actually stated the portion sizes were tapas sized.  Nothing special, go to Tacos El Asador for the real deal.  Only serves wine by the bottle. 

Also, $6 for a tiny glass of juice - wtf?"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Average Mexican taking advantage of inflated Toronto Mexican food prices. The value just isn't there. 

Why: Been hearing a bit about Fonda Lola so though I'd try it out!

Who: Group of 4

What: Margaritas, Guac, Candied Jalapeno bacon, plenty of tacos

The Story:
Walked in and was a but thrown off by the rustic, Mexican back alley feel of the joint... Mostly because the storefront felt completely different. Got super excited about the back patio - which I would recommend if the weather is good!

The menu looked great with plenty of margarita options and a to the point food selection. 

Drinks were good - but not sure if we could really appreciate the subtle flavor differences between the multiple types we got.

Food was underwhelming. The quantity didnt match what we expected of the price and the quality didnt make up for it. I'm sure local ingredients were used, which is commendable, but the flavours just didnt stand out (nor did the somewhat dry tacos)

Service was average... Though it is frustrating when your server doesn't have a strong handle of English and cannot properly repeat back to you what you have ordered. 

WTF Moment: Love the attempt at making the bathrooms stand out as unique and differentiated .... Now if only it didn't feel like I had been kidnapped and locked in a basement constructed from spare parts. 

Next Time: I would recommend one of the many other taco joints in Toronto who are offering more bang for the $5/taco standard now in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised to read the not so amazing reviews of this place. I am so happy I didn't read any before trying out Fonda Lola.

Granted, upon arriving we didn't have a reservation so we were seated up by the window but to be honest, I loved that spot. I got to watch the world go by while enjoying some delicious eats. 

While snacking on chips and Guac (I do NOT think the portion was too small...), handheld cesars (amazing) and candied jalapeno bacon, I sipped on a Cocoloco margarita (delish!). 

We then moved on onto the deep fried cheese awesomeness and beef tacos (which were served with grilled pineapple.. probably the best decision they could have made), beans and rice. All of which were incredibly tasty.

I think the highlight though, had to of been the smoked cuba libre.. It was one of the best cocktails ever... I cannot say enough good things about the fun twist on a fairly straightforward drink.

The other thing worth noting was the service.. Everyone was so friendly and accommodating and everyone came to say hi and get to know us. It really had a family feel.

Lastly, the price.. I found it incredibly reasonable given how much we ate and drank and how much the bottom line was.

I will be back... often."}
{"text":"lovely place with cute and cozy settings. nice cocktail selection."}
{"text":"Went  last week and did the special - the whole menu for $100. There were 2 meat eaters and a vegetarian and by the end it was a struggle to finish the delicious churros.  

All the dishes were great - but the candied bacon was my fav ( I was glad it came on the salad AND as its own dish), service was very friendly too. 


I wasnt drinking but the cocktail menu looked interesting too."}
{"text":"Great service and the hand held caesar salad was amazing. Still thinking about it a day later."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

About 85-90% of their menu is gluten-free and they were also accommodating to my avocado allergy. I got their fish tacos since they use a cornmeal batter. It was delicious. 

The margaritas were good, but not great...when I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect great, so one less star there. 

The service was great and they took credit card."}
{"text":"I met Andres Marquez and Howard Dubrovsky long before they started making headlines for their new crowdfunding campaign.  Earlier this month, they got a call from the provincial securities commission about their \"IPO\" for a second location of their popular Mexican eatery - Fonda Lola, named in memory of a great grandmother and aunt.

Marquez, who started working in kitchens at the ripe age of 16 was formerly a partner at Milagro while Dubrovsky dished out molecular gastronomy at the now shuttered L.A.B on College Street.

The cozy Queen West joint is famed for their candied jalapeno-maple bacon and generous shots of tequila.  Marquez sure knows how to entertain, which is why he's in charge of front of house as Dubrovsky mans the kitchen.

Our group arrives for the Mexican fiesta, aka the whole menu* ($150) and we didn't leave hungry (or thirsty) for that matter.

I'm not one for hype, but upon biting into the perfectly caramelized jalapeno-bacon I comprehend the obsession and am instantly wanting seconds.  Luckily, the bacon makes an encore appearance in the handheld Caesar (think lettuce wrap or taco sans tortilla).  Eating with your hands is always more fun.

The cheese lover in me loved the Panela popper (think deep fried cheese); the cheese which is similar to paneer, is marinated in chipotle and then coated with cornmeal.

On the dairy note, the sour cream they use is life changing.  Maybe it's because this is the full fat stuff that you just can't get at the grocery store (like that 84 Stirling butter) that makes you wanted to ladle spoonfuls into your mouth, forgetting all about the calories until you wake up the next morning and step on a scale?  I don't care - I'll pedal the hell out of my bike at spin class the next day - it's worth it!

I learn from Marquez that the sour cream purveyor is Asti Products, owned by one Mr. Singh who after spotting the similarities in paneer and queso has now started peddling his dairy products for the Latin American market.  His operation is based out of Ingersol.

The fideo pasta dish reminds me that sometimes the simple things in life are the most satisfying.  Fideo is the Spanish word for noodle; but think noodle that's been snipped into shorter pieces.  It is tossed in a tomato-based sauce and topped with that heavenly sour cream.

While I normally don a sad face when forced to eat my vegetables or go the non-meat route, vegetarians will be happy to know that salad isn't the only boring option.  The Kale Tofu \"Taco\" is composed of a cornmeal crusted tofu and dressed with an avocado chile mayo and pickled onions.  You definitely won't miss the meat.

As delicious as everything is, make sure you save some room for churros!  These Mexican sweet treats are rolled in cinnamon sugar and served alongside with cajeta (caramel sauce).

Be sure to order a margarita or two like the kombucha margarita or the Smoked Cuba Libre, a modernist take on a rum and coke.  The coke is smoked in a bunsen burner-like glass.

Fonda Lola is a great place to go with a group of friends.  The drinks are generous and the food is simple, tasty and fun.  If you're having a birthday party; call ahead because Fonda Lola might just give you a piñata. Now that's a true Mexican fiesta!
 
*The dishes mentioned in the blog post were the highlights of my meal but we also had the trout aguachile, Jefe snack, kale salad, guacamole, quecas, carne asada skillet and arroz con frijol to round out the entire menu*"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes when we walked in - although the place was packed, everyone was very young and the place felt more like a bar rather than a foodie destination.  So, I really expected to sit, have a few Mexican beers, some basic tacos and be underwhelmed.  Well, the opposite happened, we got seated at the bar near the kitchen.  The menu was short.  We started with guac and light homemade chips (good so far), then the hand held caesar salad.  This is where the meal took a turn for the serious.  OMG.  I will be dreaming about this dish. sweet, spicy, salty and smokey in every bite.  Textures smooth and crisp.  Temperature warm and cold. wow! heaven! Then we had some cornmeal dredged fried cheese served on a delicious salsa (would have been better if the salsa was not so cold).  Good, but not dream worthy.  Then the flank steak which was served like a small portion fajita.  The steak was stellar - the stuff with it, standard - all in all - yummy.  The next big highlight - the churros.  Crispy outside, light and doughy inside.  Served with some sort of whipped (goat) cream? flavoured with bit of cinnamon and spice. Dreamy.  We were served by the friendly bartender and greeted by all the staff and owners.  The place has a nice, friendly vibe and lives up to the expression (which is used as the philosophy for the restaurant) \"mi casa es su casa\".  We will be back."}
{"text":"Dropped in here on a Sunday night.

Overall would say food was 4/5. Big hits were the 
Trout Aguachile - delicious ceviche with mini crisps on the side - definitely the fave of the night 
Hand held caesar - essentially a casear taco - yum!
Tacos al pasto - had the beef, great flavour and you can't go wrong with roasted pineapple - four tortillas - perfect size
Churros - always the must have and here is no exception 

The other dishes... the quesa and poppers were good, but didn't blow me away.

Drinks were also tasty - very good traditional margarita, and while only two beers to choose from, Steam Whistle and Spearhead Hawaiian, I like them both.

Great service - one of our dishes wasn't put in the system right away - which was no biggie by any means, but got an apology along with 2 tequila shots which was a fantastic gesture. 

Definitely will go back - patio wasn't open (damn you April cold weather) but I fully anticipate that will the place to be very shortly!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, wonderful food, great atmosphere. Highly recommended. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Went last night for a girl's night out. There was four of us and we opted to do the full menu for $100. They accommodated for some dietary restrictions and the preggo in the group who couldn't enjoy the bevies. The fingerling kaffir lime that sits on the edge of the Margarita class is to die for, once squeezed into your drink you're pleasantly surprised with little pieces of zest between your teeth floating their way through the straw - nom nom!

The highlight were the salads, bacon and pork/beef tacos that come with a bit of pineapple. While the churros sitting in some sort of creamy heaven was delish, I'd love to see other dessert options.  

The staff are friendly and enthusiastic and my only complaint was that the female server on staff was so eager to clear our table that she'd often take plates that still had a bit of food without consulting with us whether or not we were finished with that course - that was a tad annoying! 

Otherwise, awesome place and am happy to support them with another visit. 

PS: I like that you can get a reso by simply texting them cuz who really wants to talk to anyone ... online booking would be good too ... but text is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Good food and had a quaint nice romantic feel to the restaurant. The service was excellent and the owner even came out to give us a shot of really good tequila. I'm a vegetarian and found it easier to eat here than other restaurants. Best part of the meal was the churros."}
{"text":"Omgggggggg!!! Amazing Mexican food!
So I am Mexican, I am also vegetarian my hubby is Mexican and a carnivore so we have different perspectives regarding food, we both agree that the food here is amazing.
The tlacoyos, quecas and Guac were amazing (and vegetarian) the tacos al pastor \"felt like mexico\" (he said) so it was a win -win. The service and the dessert were also great. The chef (who is from Mexico) came to greet us and ask how was everything, that was a nice touch. 
We are for sure coming back and I highly recommend Fonda Lola to anyone who is a Mexican food lover 

Get the churros con cajeta for dessert"}
{"text":"Little cozy place on Queen West. Awesome Marguaritas and rally good and unique tacos, great churros.  The portions could be bigger but that's ok.  Their service is very professional and friendly.  I can't wait to go back.  

I've come back to Fonda Lola a few months after my initial review and was saddened to experience the food and service were not as good as before. Enough so that I don't have the desire to come back especially since the neighborhood has quite a few much better options."}
{"text":"This place is just okay imo. It's wildly expensive and the food portions are quite small, so it's hard to feel like you're really getting your money's worth or value. The ambiance is quite nice and it's a perfect date night environment with a candle lit dinner. I felt like you're partly paying for the ambiance rather than the food or service. Service was really good, our server Lisa was really nice and attentive.

The food is good, but small portions especially considering how expensive it is. I ordered the steak tacos and part of it was filled with french fries which just came across as filler to me. I've had much better tacos for cheaper elsewhere. 

TL;DR go here if you don't mind paying a lot for a date night candle lit dinner and you're not looking to be stuffed. Food is decent, but don't expect to be full or have it be cheap. Cold corona and okay mexican fare. I hear the vegetarian is good."}
{"text":"Not too busy on a Friday night. Maybe I'm too early. Tried to tweet @fondalola for a surprise (the menu said so), but only thing I was surprised about was no tweet back.

Onto the drinks, had what was described as a manhattan but with tequila. I wouldn't say it was a citrusy drink. The cucumber at the end was deeply infused. Only other thing on bar menu that looked interesting was the smoked rum and coke.

Onto the food, the hand held caesar salad was unique. The smoke bacon (which is also on the menu) on top was great! Also tried what was an purple empanada was a little bit of a let down. The green sauce that came on the plate made it look super cool, but the green sauce had minimal flavor.

Then the ceviche trout, wow, lots of lime! Tasted pretty good and fresh. I liked the potato chip coins to eat it with. And then lastly the special was a chorizo skillet taco. There was a generous amount of chorizo, enough for basically six tacos; they give you four tortillas but are nice enough to bring a few more when asked. The tortillas are nice and warm, but doesn't look freshly made to order. The chorizo was decent but again wasn't anything to write home about.

The service, they were nice enough the whole way. The thing is though I found the food menu to lack a bit of variety as well as the bar menu. The bar menu sounded all very citrusy so if I wanted something different, couldn't get it beyond beer."}
{"text":"The food here is super tasty! Fun music and summery casual vibe. The fish tacos are delicious.  Only reason for the four stars is that it's over priced for a casual Mexican place. The patio is the perfect spot for a lazy weekend brunch in the sun but the drinks and food are too expensive to make it a regular Sunday Funday booze brunch spot for me."}
{"text":"Fonda Lola has been one of my major summer disappointments.  This winter I visited it as part of a group celebratory dinner and had such a fun and thrilling experience.  I enthusiastically took my foodie friend along for a repeat on their quite nice summer patio.  Alas, 2 stars is hard to give right now.   The food was either terrible value or just terrible and the service wasn't much better...sorry!

The FOOD:
We started with the Candied Jalapeño Bacon ($10).  This was so good the first time I'd had, and was good this time as well, but were shocked to find that the serving size was two pieces of bacon cut in half.  For this price, I could have purchased 2 packages of bacon!

We followed up with the Quesadillas with huitlacoche ($12).  Basically one tortilla worth of cheese and muchroom...middling in quality.  The huitlacoche was not quite the Mexican truffle advertised.  

The real disaster came in the form of carne asada tacos ($18 or $22, I don't remember).  This meat was tough!  It's embarrassing when you can't actually separate the meat in a taco with your teeth and have to ask for a sharp knife.  Even the sharp knife required a table wobbling attack.  We eventually gave up and couldn't even finish it.  The worst part, the staff (including one of the owners) just didn't care.

Meanwhile, the table next to me, which has just ordered the expensive Mexican fiesta is being badgered by the owner to order a cocktail.  One of them was a non-drinker and the other didn't want to drink alone.  No means no.  It's not like they were trying to order some cheap appetizer and take a table..they had just ordered the most expensive thing they could.

In the end, we were shocked by the cost of the meal, the terrible value, and the low quality of the food.  Somehow after spending $75 on two cocktails and food, we had to go out for dinner afterward.  

Oh well, I had such high hopes for this place!

P.S. The basil mojitos can be very good, so that's one way I can end on a positive note."}
{"text":"I've been to Fonda Lola twice in the last couple of weeks. Hospitality wise, they hit it out of the park. The food is also delicious - but my one complaint is about portion sizes. The tacos are served in a mini skillet and the amount of filling does not match the 4 corn tortillas they supply. As well as the fish, super delicious but the portion size is so tiny for the price. Hopefully they will consider increasing the portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, ok tacos, way over priced. Two people with four drinks each = $165. I wouldn't come back here. There is better Mexican food for a reasonable price outside of W Queen St."}
{"text":"After my initial visit I thought they were A-OK with a few minor quibbles. 

Reflecting on my second visit. This Queen St boite drops with a discernible thud and are hanging on to a \"meh\" by the skin of their teeth. The food is not really the issue. Service, attitude and value for money (or lack thereof) definitely are. 

What remains outstanding are their unique, if pricey - $12, Kombucha Margaritas and superb churros. 

My ongoing frustration continues with the nachos... Great nacho chips, but the guacamole which should be a paste-like consistency is closer in texture to a thin smoothie, and a rather sparse portion at that. 

The Trout Aguachile, Mexican cousin to the South American ceviche, wonderfully presented, is once again miserly in terms of portions size. I still find it far too tart despite the chef explaining, on our initial visit, that this is an authentic rendition of the Mexican version. My co-diner, on the other hand, can't get enough of it! 

Discussion and more specifically insistence of culinary authenticity is a topic often fraught with factual letdowns. Case in point was the server looking after a party of ten at the table next to us. As soon as they were comfortably ensconced in their seats he proceeded to announce: Guys this is an authentic Mexican Restaurant so no burritos or fish tacos. Had he spent any time in or bothered to explore information about Mexico's Baja area, he would know that not only are burritos and tacos authentic to that region, but are culinary staples. 

On the subject of authenticity, I am compelled to mention their flank steak $15, with raw mole. The steak itself presented in a diminutive cast iron skillet and sided with warmed soft tortillas is beautifully cooked and quite flavourful. Their version of \"so called\" mole was a spectacular let down, admittedly only for me, as none of the other diners mentioned it. It was thin and lacked any discerning texture and flavour of what authentic mole should be. 

Let me put my assessment in perspective: I first ate chicken mole home cooked, in Los Angeles, by an extended family member who hailed from Mexico. It was then that I first fell in love with it (and another reason why I so wanted to come back to Fonda Lola, as it wasn't on the menu on my first visit--I think you can delete this part of the sentence). I have also ordered and enjoyed it at Rick Bayless' flagship resto Topolobampo in Chicago. Mr. Bayless is one of America's best known purveyor of authentic Mexican cuisine, having lived in Mexico for six years and was a student of Spanish and Latin American culture. Finally, two years ago at top rated Salpicon in Chicago, whose chef is Mexican born Priscilla Satkoff. She was anointed \"One of the Top Chefs of Mexico\" by Larousse Gastronomique. All three aforementioned renditions of mole were similar in satisfying flavour and texture. Sadly Fonda Lola's version had no relationship or failed to spark even a faint reminiscence to them. 

Another bit of frustration is their cavalier attitude with payment. When I made my reservation, via text, there was no mention that they are now or likely to be \"cash only\". It was only when we arrived that we saw paper signs by the window. When we inquired with our server we were informed that this is an ongoing issue due to haphazard internet service in the restaurant. We would have appreciated prior notice, saving me a walk in the rain to a convenience store based ATM, plus service charge. Some notice, at very least on their website, would have been appreciated, but unfortunately their homepage has had a promissory \"coming soon\" announcement since late last summer. 

Time between courses seemed to drag on and on. 

Finally consider that at almost $50/person for dinner the adults in our group left hungry!"}
{"text":"So the four stars was more about the service than anything else.  The personal attention from Andres def made our night.  The amuse busche and house tequila he shared just made the night so much more intimate.  The food was good but no dishes really stood out (I would pass on the fish tacos).  The decor is quaint but maybe a little too much so"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. Underwhelmed the first time, disappointed the second time.  We are done. 

The fish tacos are a bland rip-off. 

We would generally never complain about small portions or prices, but with so many better options in the area, the only reason to eat here is because you can get a table anywhere else and you are starving. 

There is a reason you can get a table, the food is super mediocre."}
{"text":"My family came to Fonda Lola for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was busy (but we got a table immediately which was great) with a very nice atmosphere. For 4 people, coffee and main dishes (no appetizers or cocktails) came to $90 including tip. We skipped on cocktails as they were very overpriced, for example a Caesar is $13. The food was average. We had huevos rancheros and the 3 egg entree. The service was slow (but friendly) as only 1 server was working. One complaint is that the coffee is made by French press which tastes very good, however was served extremely slowly as you can only make 2 cups at a time. They should really have multiple batches of coffee going to serve an entire restaurant.

Overall, I would not return here as I was not blown away and feel there are better brunch offerings in Toronto."}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant for their Winterlicious menu  and were blown away by the quality of food and service! I had the best tofu taco ever, and I'm also in love with their strawberry infused mojito.

The picture I took of their tofu tacos does not do them any justice. It was so light and flavorful but unfortunately cannot be captured in my pic.Their tortilla soup and churros were also pretty good. I look forward to trying their other regular menu items!"}
{"text":"When this place opened it was good.  Now the service is awful. The food is overpriced for what you get. Ordered the steak in lettuce and got two, that I could price out at 8 dollars each. I could go to any taco place and get a better deal. And my friends noted that their food tasted like nothing. The guac was even awful - how do you even screw that up.  The server dropped our forks, didn't understand that it is impolite to clear plates when other people are eating and took over 10 minutes to bring us drinks. 

 Fix your menu. Hire better servers. #neveragain"}
{"text":"Such a great spot on Queen West! Really sweet and lovely with an amazing ambiance. In the summer, the secret enclosed patio is amazing, too! 
The food is incredible - such a fresh and welcome twist on Mexican infused dishes. The dishes are refined and exquisitely designed without being pretentious. The cocktails are amazing and the tequila flows. 
Definitely try the hand held Caesar salads....honestly, I crave then constantly!!!"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend here for a quick night out and was very happy.  The service, the food, the drinks were very very good! Had a great time, will definitely be going back.  Very authentic, not like other Mexican restaurants I've been to before.

Good Job Fonda Lola!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
A really intimate, sexy place. It's small so it does get crowded quick and if you have to wait, they'll set you up at the back and get your drink order ASAP. Andres and Ernesto are some of the nicest guys in the business and work really hard at making sure they're customers are happy with their #MexicanFiesta! OLE (oh, that's someone else's catchphrase ;) ). 

I ATE/DRANK 
The Kombucha Maragrita is fantastic (read: it's strong and flavourful). Also note that you can store your tequila bottles here (cool idea guys). 

Guac - I'm a chunky guac fan myself but I liked the mousse version. You'll gobble this up. 
Quecas - yummy, yummy, yummy mini quesadillas but the portions are tiny. At least you don't feel ripped off by the price so I'd get two orders of this if you're starving or not buying the whole menu (which you can do if you order the \"Mexican Fiesta\"). 
Trout aguachile - the ceviche was a miss in my books. I didn't like the presentation (too chunky) and it was WAY too acidic. The guys know this so if you're not a fan of acidity I would opt for something else. 
Churros - ohhh yeah. A bit pricey for what it is but at least you get a good portion. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Fonda is a fantastic date place and really affordable for what the quality of food you're getting. I like that they're taking the Mexican theme beyond the tacos (but at least it's there if you want it). Disclosure: Andres is a friend of mine and I think I've been fair in this review. So proud of him and his team! Andres will make you feel like you're at casa. His saying is \"Mi casa est su casa.\" Truly, you'll feel at home here."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointing and without any redeeming virtues, probably the worst meal I've had in Toronto. Went there without reading too much about it last week with a friend since it's close by and seemed cute. We elected for the Mexican Fiesta which allows you to experience a wide assortment of slop from this place. The portions were laughably tiny - like that video of a hamster eating a teeny tiny burrito small. The appetizer for two people? Two strips of smoked bacon littered with aluminum foil. We sent it back so they could scrape it off and back it came with a bit less foil. The Caesar salad? Two pieces of iceberg lettuce with teeny tiny pieces of iceberg lettuce in it that's supposed to be handheld. An abomination.  Then we had a couple more courses of teeny tiny tacos. One was some sort of chicken that looked more like a tikka masala but not as flavourful. Then there was a cast iron skillet with a shrimp type of dish - it was the only good taco we had and was presented (as illustrated) with an accompanying container of teeny tiny tacos so we could make them ourselves - the visual appeal documented for your pleasure. Finally we had some sort of lettuce wrapped abomination that looked and tasted like the gristle from a Vietnamese pho.  Just unbelievable that they would consider this for for serving a paying audience. The sangria tasted like sour lemon water. We complained to the waitress who gaslighted about how generous the portions were and even gave some feedback about our disappointment to the owner who seemed utterly disinterested. Absolutely garbage. You'd have a far higher quality meal for a much lower price at a fast food Mexican restaurant. 

In summary, terrible flavourless food, overpriced, and a presentation worthy of a corrections facility cafeteria. It only scores well for ambiance and the cute patio."}
{"text":"Fonda Lola is a Mexican restaurant by Trinity Bellwoods that serves a variety of tacos and magaritas. I had the pleasure of trying some of their menu items while sitting at their back patio on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. The manager recommended a couple of their best-selling items, which were the Candied Jalapeno Bacon and the Baja Fish Taco. I ended up loving both of those items! The Candied Jalapeno Bacon has a spicy kick to it, but is still manageable for people who usually avoid spicy food. I thought the Baja Fish Taco was absolutely delicious. It has a great combination of flavours that melts into your mouth. The other taco I tried was the Tacos al Pastor. I say to pass on these. The pork was not very tender and the pineapple did not make for a great combination.

I ordered one of their margaritas, the Guadalupe. It was alright, I wasn't completely wowed by the drink as it was a bit more sour than sweet. I did try the Horchata for the first time and loved it. It's non-alcoholic as well! It's a light and naturally sweet drink. I learnt that people would drink horchatas to clean their palate while eating. I highly recommend drinking this if you order some spicy food!

Fonda Lola has a great array of food, which some are hits and others are misses. The downfall is probably their price point. The portions are smaller and best if you want to eat something light to share but don't mind spending a little bit more on."}
{"text":"A very nice meal. I loved the citrus margarita and the taco de tofu sofrito. The chicken soup was good but the broth lacked a bit of flavour. It's a nice but small space and it got busy on a Friday night--make a reservation."}
{"text":"So frickin good. Just go.  Don't ask questions.  Just go."}
{"text":"I visited Fonda Lola just a week or two after it opened.  It was kind of weird: the space is nice, as small Dundas West restaurants go.  But the food was a bit underwhelming and a bit overpriced, while the drinks blew away my expectations and were an absolute steal.  I went in looking for a great Mexican dining experience and came away with a new watering hole.  Not what I was aiming for, but I'll take it!

Guacamole - $5 - A very solid guac with house-made tortilla chips, my party enjoyed this, though it was nothing special.  If we return we'll likely order it again as it's good drinking food.

Hand Held Caesar - $8 - An interesting take on the traditional salad, this was two tender leaves of butter lettuce filled with a Caesar avocado mousse, candied jalapeno bacon, and a bit of parmigianno reggiano.  Good?  Yes.  The textures work together pretty well here, with everything but the bacon amalgamating smoothly which only serves to make the sweet heat and the chew of the bacon stand out more.  That said, two bites of salad for eight bucks is a bit of a tough sell.  Tasty and worth a try, but probably not a repeat.

Trout Aguachile - $8 - A fairly simple trout ceviche, the flavors here were citrusy and light, with some good textures.  But the actual method of serving was flawed.  The trout's diced up into tiny bits, and it's then served on equally tiny tortilla rounds each about the size of a quarter.  It was really difficult to scoop up the ceviche with those tiny little chips, and I had to chase individual pieces of trout around an oversized bowl through the citrus dressing.  The value here wasn't bad, but it was just a b*tch to try to eat.  The bowl needs to be smaller or the chips bigger; preferably both.

Tacos Al Pastor - $10 - Jesus am I ever tired of al pastor.  The go-to taco for nearly every Mexican place in the city, al pastor's wildly over done in Toronto.  We had it here, done with pork, and served in a little bowl with four small tortillas, some tomatillo salsa, and a bit of pineapple.  It's fine, it's just not great.  And it's not worth recommending or ordering again.

We had a few other dishes, including the perfectly passable but unexciting beans, and some mini-quesadillas flavored with huitlacoche, which our server explained as \"the truffle of Mexican cuisine,\" and that Wikipedia defined as \"corn smut - mold that grows on corn.\"  I think the truth of the thing was somewhere between the two extremes, but the flavors were so mild and unnoticeable that I don't think it mattered.

Drinks.  That's where this place shined!  I started with their Classic Margarita, which was one of the best I've ever had.  Loaded with tequila and a lovely blend of citruses, it's a refreshing and full-bodied take that stands out amongst the crowd.  The garnish was a very nice touch: rimmed with a lemon salt, and bolstered with a finger lime, the garnish added dimension to the flavors on offer.  At $10.50 it was well worth the price.  But the Basil Mojito was perhaps even better, and only cost seven bucks.  Minty, green with the aroma of basil and full of flavor, the mojito probably makes the strongest argument for a return trip.  I want to come back and try everything else on their drink menu, especially the kombucha cocktails.

But all food and drink aside, the staff at this place makes a return trip tough to justify.  Let me be specific: the server? Awesome.  The bartender?  Even better!  A great guy who was happy to help us with the menu and share his insights, without making us feel like we were being \"sold\" to.  They were outstanding.

The problem was the female front of house (who at least one other Yelper's posted about).  When we first arrived, our server immediately pitched us on the \"Mexican Fiesta\" tasting menu; a $100 fifteen course exercise in ridiculousness that I'd be shocked if anyone ever ordered.  I mean, come on guys; there's a difference between a \"tasting menu\" and \"we are blatantly trying to sell you everything all at once.\"  But there's no harm in trying, right?  And the server handled it appropriately.

However, a discussion between the server and the aforementioned front of house, who must have a considerable stake in the restaurant's success, was conducted right behind us as we ate.  In said discussion, she berated our server right in front of us at full volume, for \"not selling the Mexican Fiesta\" to a party of four at the other end of the restaurant.  \"Did you offer them the Mexican Fiesta?!\"  The server admitted he had not.  \"IT'S YOUR *JOB* TO SELL THEM THE MEXICAN FIESTA!\"  Shouted.  At our poor server.  Right in front of everyone.

Not cool, lady.  You don't treat your staff that way, especially in front of customers.

So yeah, if I can brave knowing my money's probably going to that unpleasant individual, and want some admittedly killer drinks backed by some middle-of-the-road food, I'll be back.  

But I think I just talked myself out of it."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out randomly. As soon as we walked in, it reminded me of a restaurant right out of Mexico, they even had the white and blue print plates. We scored a seat on their tiny but quaint patio. Andreas the owner sat down with us to go through the menu. He is quite the comedian and very personable. 

We ordered ordered ceasers and Huevos rancheros. The ceasers were topped with a slice of candied maple syrup and jalapeño bacon and it was the perfect touch, along with the finger Ling limes. The tequila was prominent which is never a bad thing. 

Overall i would go back."}
{"text":"Fonda Lola started their business as a pop-up in 2012, and was one of the popular vendors at the The Stop Night Market. Due to gaining a following, they quickly acquired a spot on Queen St W, and opened a restaurant by 2013. Fonda Lola's space was quite warm as it was designed with rustic materials, painted ceramics, and other Mexican mementos. To this day, Fonda Lola strives to remain an ambassador of the Mexican culture, and have brought the food, tequila and customs to the multiculturalism of Toronto.

Guacamole - A national Mexican dish. At Fonda Lola's, we don't add any tomatoes or onions to our recipe in order to give you a smoother, creamier, richer texture. Served with crunchy freshly-made tortilla chips. The chips were incredibly crispy, and tasted great with the creamy guacamole.

Shrimp Aguachile - A more piquant version of ceviche, lime and jalapeño concoction. This particular dish hailed from Sinaloa Mexico, and Vickie's take on it was very flavorful. The shrimp was marinated in lime and jalapeño juices giving it with a very zesty flavor. I also thought that the saltiness balanced quite nicely with the citrus making it a refreshing Mexican-style ceviche.

Tacos Gobernador - A creamy tender shrimp taco. We take onions, tomatoes, red and yellow bell peppers, mix them with chile ancho, and cook for three hours to bring out a full flavour. We add oaxaca cheese and melt it just a bit before serving. From Mazatlan, Mexico. I highly recommend this traditional creamy shrimp taco, as it was just a delightful concoction."}
{"text":"Today was hangover Mexican food day for myself. I decided to try Fonda Lola out after walking by numerous times. 

The Food: I had ordered the Lolas egg's benny. The presentation of the food was great with average sized portions. I did enjoy this plate however I found that the dish lacked taste which allowed the food to be bland. 

The Restaurant: I really enjoyed the decor of Fonda Lola. It had a certain feel that gave an authentic feel. I thought it was a pretty niffty idea to use old tequila bottles as water containers for each table.

The Service: I found the service to be nothing special and was just ok. They had two servers at the time. The one girl who we had waiting our table was friendly enough and helpful. When it came to pay our bill we dealt with the other server who made it feel as if we were kind of a burden and cutting into her time. 

Overall: I would go back again but it is not a favorite spot of mine with the numerous other restaurants along Queen Street."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Mexican food in Toronto (and also in Mexico.) Fonda Lola's food is among the very best I've had. They have a way of taking something traditional and adding a grace and twist to it that makes it very special. we had three appies. First was the guacamole, which was a puree with fresh tacitos and the only thing we weren't crazy about. But the Hand held Cesar salad, was astonishing. The salad was rolled in lettuce topped with a slice of crispy jajapeño and eaten like a taco. The ceviche which followed it was also terrific with a sharp lime marinade to die for. We all had the pork tacos served in a hot mini-fry pan with salsa and pineapple. These tacos pastor were first-rate, as were the churros we had for dessert.
Our service was excellent, and the atmosphere friendly and funky. One thing to know is that the menu is quite small. You won't find a huge range of typical things, but what you do find will please your palate"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Fonda Lola on a Sunday evening, the restaurant wasn't very busy with only four other tables occupied. The service was good, our waiter was kind and very friendly. Overall the atmosphere was nice, and the back patio was a great escape. 

The quality of the food was good, though for the price point I was not impressed at all. To do a simple comparison to other Mexican restaurants, it was a huge eye opener. The portion size and price of the guacamole and tortilla chips was about a quarter of the size that La Carnita would serve but cost 20% more. The amount of the churros were the same in comparison, though the amount of sauce that was given was way less than half than what you would have got at La Carnita, and the price increase was 50% more (which I was shocked to see because I've seen photos of a large amount of sauce on the plate, maybe they just ran out?). We tried the candied bacon and for $8 you get two slices of bacon. Taco prices are comparable at the the $5 mark. Lastly, we had a pitcher of tap water which I am completely fine with - but not when it's warm. Room temperature water would have been a appreciated, but not warm. 

Overall, the food was okay - but for the price point I will not be returning. I would expect a lot more in quality, or in portion size for the amount of money I'm spending."}
{"text":"Have been a fan of Andres Marquez (@andres_tequila) and Howard Dubrovsky (previously L.A.B post here), so I have no idea why I haven't been to Fonda Lola (@fondalola) sooner for a real meal that is since I was here for the media launch.

Oh yes maybe because it's so difficult to get a reservation, this time I made plans with friends and made the reservation a month in advance.

The 4 of us decided to go with the Mexican Fiesta which is a taste of the whole menu for $150. (we got a deal on Travelzoo for $99)

CocoLoco Margarita $14
~ Citrus Margarita base with coconut water & lime kefir
~ Andre's recommendation for this \"kinda healthy\" cocktail with the hydrating coconut water and the turmeric added.
~ It has all the component of a cocktail that I like, perfectly refreshing and tart while I wait for my friends.

Cesar $12
~ V8 juice, aguachile, aged tequila with candied bacon
~ It was my friend's drink, being a big Cesar fan this was too thick for my taste and I bet it's because of the V8 use instead of the Clamato.
~ But OMG, the salt/chili rim and the bacon was so good.

And the fiesta start with a plate of that perfect Candied Jalapeno Bacon, total my type of candy #obsessed

Smoked Cuba Libre $12
~ Smoked Coke, aged rum and lime
~ Smoked to order, it came smoking and not only does it look amazing when pour at the table, it was really delicious and you can actually taste the smokey flavor.

Clericot $12
~ aka Kombucha sangria. Beet Vodka, cherry kombucha & soda
~ My first cocktail was so good that I had to order a second one, I was totally curious as to what beet vodka would taste like and this was sweet and with barely any alcohol flavor, I know a lot of ladies who would love this.

Guacamole

Panela Popper
~ Chipotle marinated cheese coated in cornmeal
~ Who wouldn't love deep fried cheese?!
~ Similar to paneer, this was slightly chewy which was perfect with he sauce and pairs perfectly with their cocktail (or a shot of tequila or two).

Mexican Kale Salad
~ mixed greens, kale, chayote, jicama, carrots, cucumber and beets in a citrus agave dressing

Trout Aguachile
~ a more piquant version of ceviche with vegs
~ Thought it was slightly too tart which overpower the fish but the vegs does help balance it out with the chips.

Quecas
~ Fresh Corn tortilla, poblano pepper, shallot and cheese
~ This was so flaky good and I didn't even miss the meat in it.

Kale Tofu Taco
~ crispy cornmeal tofu, avocado chile mayo, pickled onion
~ We were a bit sad to see another meatless dish but I promise that you won't miss it here.
~ The tofu was crispy perfect with the pickled onions and love the softer kale instead of the taco shell with the cornmeal crust.
~ What a great vegetarian option apart from the usual salad.

Carnitas
~ This was so delicious, probably the more traditional dish on the menu. Love the simplicity of it, the simple flavor of the braised tender juicy pork.



Fish Taco
~ warm tortillas, battered sustainable white fish, lettuce, slaw with jalapeno tequila crema
~ Love the big piece of perfectly cook flaky fish with the thin batter.
~ Love how everything is separate and you make your own so that you can add more or less of everything to your liking.

Carne Asada Skillet
~ Flank steak, ancient raw mole, tortillas
~ The sauce was amazing, only wish there was more of it

Arroz con frijol
~ White rice w/ veg and beans, Mexican flava
~ This was delicious with a great rice and bean ratio.

Chocolate Churros & Spicy Salty Candied Bacon Chocolate
~ Make sure to save room for dessert, these churros (no hole centered, solid) are rolled in cinnamon sugar and served on top of the cajeta (caramel tasting sauce).
~ The chocolate is to die for, everything that I love in one bite. Can you please see these so I can buy a box?!

Mexican Flan
~ Another yummy dessert, especially love the brittle on top.

Verdict:
~ A great place to be, especially with a group of friends
~ Drinks are amazing and generous
~ The food can't be more delicious and fun
~ And Andre can't be a better host, thanks a bunch 
~ Would be back in a heartbeat and can't wait to come back when their patio opens up

P.S : The place is always packed, so best if you make a reservation way in advance."}
{"text":"I came to Fonda Lola with a couple of coworkers for a farewell dinner. Our guest of honour had met one of the owners while partying in Brazil during World Cup earlier this year. So, thanks to him, we got a free round of margaritas on the house (yay!) and had a great time on the lovely patio in the back. 

There were 3 types of margaritas on the menu, and between 7 of us, I was able to sample all 3. I had the Coco Loco personally, which was a coconut water based Margarita. I love coconut water, so this drink was right up my alley. The original one was delicious as well, but I wasn't a big fan of the variation with Komboucha.

We decided to try the entire menu. The highlights are as follows:

Candied bacon- yum! a good mix of spicy, sweet & savoury! 

Panela popper- jalapeño marinated panela cheese coated in corn meal. Piping hot deep fried cheese was delectable!

Steak tartare- I don't like all steak tartares, but this one was light and not over-seasoned! Thumbs up!

Hand held caesar- a hybrid of a lettuce wrap and a salad, and to make it even better, it had some of that delicious smoked bacon. Bonus points for creativity!

The ones I would skip next time:

We had the cod, and it was the only thing that I didn't like. The fish was a little bland and tough- not a good combination. 

Churros- normally I love churros, so i really wanted to love them. Unfortunately, I didn't. These were a little on the heavy side and for me, there were too much sugar coating. 

All in all, we really enjoyed dinner and margaritas."}
{"text":"1.5 actually.
I'm surprised at the other reviews. Maybe it was an off night or maybe they were once good before but have not kept it up. 
Dinner took an extremely long time because the service was soooo slow. It took us even a while before we even got our...water. 
I give the points to the friendly pleasant waitress and the intimate decor. 
I'm surprised that with competition around and high overhead that this place is around if it is always anything like what I experienced the one time I was here.
The waitress though friendly was slow to come to our table or even offer us water. She was generous in saying she would come back to give us more water and offer more hot sauce but those did not come. 

I had the chicken consume and was tremendously disappointed. A watery bland broth, tasteless chicken shavings and chunks of hard plain broccoli and cauliflower. Sure, some cilantro and pepper and onions on the side but adding them cold like that instead of even cooking it in the broth even adds to the blandness if this meal. Hey bonus this must be healthy, but healthy doesn't have to be this bland especially for 15$! 
The ever raved about candied bacon was pretty darn candied that it was only a hint of bacon... And the bacon was soft not crispy. Sooo that was a no for me and my friend. 
Another friend said her chicken taco was good but nothing to rave about. Another friend had the tofu taco and it tasted like plain tofu, no flavor at all. 
The Virginia margarita tasted too sour than I would've liked.
Another thing to note was that I couldn't hear my friends. It was soooooo difficult to have a conversation because the music was loud. When we kindly asked if they could lower it a bit, the waitress kindly said it was because people were talking to loud so the music had to be louder so that people can hear it. Huh?
We don't really go to a restaurant to focus on the music more than the company we are with. 
Anyways- I saw the low reviews but coming her I was hopeful. Unfortunately it disappointed me more than the lower ratings I saw. 
The people were friendly enough, maybe under staffed, maybe just an off night. But this is my rating for the one experience of it all. I would not go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and tried out Fonda Lola on a Thursday night. We got the last seats; sitting at the bar, which we thought was a good sign. 

Even though the place has been open for a few months now; there was a sledge hammer beside our seats and a bunch of screws. The bar also didn't look finished, they were using buckets for storage - it just seemed odd.

The bartender who served us was nice; we told him it was our first time and he helped to chose some items. He however then proceed to offer (and take) shots with all the groups of women in the bar/restaurant. Since we are a couple we were not offered this luxury. I found this kind of sleazy. 

The chef came out multiple times and stood beside us; rubbing his hands through his greasy hair and helping himself to beer from the taps. I found this a huge turn-off. 

Finally the food which was pretty boring. We had the guacamole and bean dip. The Guac was basically whipped avocados and I'm pretty sure they added mayo. Beans were whipped refried  beans with no added  flavour/spice. The \"quesadilla\" was basically a pizza pocket with VERY little cheese and no flavour. The cerviche was bad with no flavour. The only things half decent things were the chips and taco.
The chef should have been spending his time in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Came here to have brunch with my sister for her birthday just before going to our 2pm show. The food was exceptional! The brunch menu was very brief with little to choose from but those little options were packed with flavor!!! I had the eggs benny and it came with a side of homefries and a salad. We also started with their guac and refillable chips which also tasted very very fresh so yummmmm and washed it all down with their brunch drinks... My sister got some kind of flower drink and i just had passion fruit. Yumm!!! Finally we finished off our lunch with their house churros which u cannot miss!! One of the best churros i have had so far in Toronto!!! You just gotta eat here!!!"}
