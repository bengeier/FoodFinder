{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight and the food was amazing! I think we almost tried one of every taco and they were all so delicious. My personal fave was the Cuban & the green Chile. My daughter scarfed the chicken and carne tacos. Salsa and chips were great and so was the beer- we tried the sessions. Owners and staff were super friendly and made it a great dining experience. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First of all, the frijoles were delicious and nutritious--I don't want to mention the price but they were a steal. I should've been charged with theft; I'm telling you they were cheap and fire and everything I've ever looked for in this world. I'm a young professional and these tacos have genuinely helped me become great at what I do."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos....Chandler has been missing a \"go to\" place like this. GET YO tacos before Trump builds the wall."}
{"text":"Upon my first trip to this place, I was welcomed by 3 different people who had an affiliation to the business. They were extremely friendly and accommodating. First impression even prior to tasting the food was excellent. Then the food..... THE FOOD! The tacos were BOMB and the guac was so insanely delicious. The vibe and decor and atmosphere are exactly what downtown Chandler needed. I will return... and return... and tell all my friends."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Vibe is upbeat. People are nice and helpful. I'm from Tennessee and will probably never be in the area again but if I am I will make a point to come back. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The lunch special has my wallet and my stomach wanting to come back time after time. A welcomed addition to the Chandler food scene."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap. $10 for 3 tacos and rice beans drink was perfect portion size.  Meat quality was good, excellent ambiance.  This place deserves your business."}
{"text":"I agree with Drake T's review. This place is nothing special and just mediocre at best. The tacos are small and they only have two salsa's...both red, medium and hot (which really wasn't even hot). Where's the green? It was almost $7 for two tacos and tax and had to go home and eat more. The only reason this place is getting 3 stars instead of 2 is because the carnitas meat was really good. The carne asada, not so much. With all of the other options around I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Another day and another review of a taco place.   These places are popping up like weeds and I keep eating.  Good food here.  3 taco combo came with tacos, rice and beans, and a drink for about 10 bucks.  Tacos were a little small, was going to order a 4th after I ate but couldn't find the cashier.  Chips were good, crispy, warm.  Good salsas.  They were out of guacamole.  I had the carne asada, fish, and green chili chicken.  Fish was the best I ordered. The chicken was a little bland.   Carne asada was what I expected.   Tried the carnitas and that was my favorite.  When I'm in the area and in the mood for tacos I will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Ghett Yo Taco. I went on a weekday evening and there was not very many people there but we were promptly helped and the man at the counter was patient and helpful to two newbies that had not yet tried their unique tacos yet. For $12 you can get three tacos of your choice, rice, beans and a can of beer! I call that a decent deal! The patio is very cool and they have their own parking lot, though small, but nice for the downtown chandler area. I have recommended to friends already and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick and easy bite and we were blown away! We got 6 out of the 9 tacos available that day, all fantastic. Love the guac, and rice & beans too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Taco Shop....you will love this place.  The pickled jalapeño are freakin awesome! 3 Taco combo with rice and beans and a drink!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the amount of food you get for the price is way way off!!! I paid over 3 dollars  for a street taco...you don't get Mexican food expecting French cuisine portions...you just dont...but that was my experience...the bad part of it is the food had great flavor! Making it hard to give a 3 star rating..."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos! Very friendly service. Unique laidback relaxed place. Tacos were interesting and delicious...They are street tacos...so small...I was happy with two but I expect most people would like three. I like to be inspired by food and these tacos met my criteria."}
{"text":"The best tacos ever.  Three of us got the three taco meal. Yes, they're small, but so delicious and filling.  The chicken and the beef in mine were beautifully charred to give them wonderful flavor and texture. Great tortillas too. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Friendly, inviting, good food.  Don't expect to get a ginormous plate of typical large chain Mexican food, this place is all about the tacos!  Limited menu but everything I ate was delish!!! Sure, the tacos are small street size but do we really need 5 pounds of food on our plates???

Not all the staff was super knowledgeable about the taco \"types\" but the guy who took our order was.  Once this place become more established and the new restaurant bugs are worked out it will be a downtown Chandler keeper for sure."}
{"text":"First time here..we live in Chandler and this will now be our favorite taco shop!!..this place is the TRUTH!!..great tacos, really good Margaritas and the staff was awesome!!..Cheers Ghett Yo Taco!!"}
{"text":"The tacos: crazy fresh, with high quality meats, crisp shaved veggies, and perfectly seasoned meats.  

The service: always friendly, accurate, and very fast.

This place does everything right and is perfect for a casual lunch or dinner.  A hidden gem in downtown Chandler for sure. 

On a side note, I don't normally share my favorite \"secret\" lunch spots with anyone...but I did with my two little kids, and they claimed it was the best quesadilla they ever had.  
One day later, they are begging me to go back.

Ghett yo at yo own risk....it's addictive."}
{"text":"Fun old school style taco shop! Great food and service. Fun to try different types of meats. Always have to try the daily special taco too!"}
{"text":"Ghett Yo Taco is a small taco shop that's got a solid selection of tacos and they're all packed with flavor. Staff is always super friendly and helpful in explaining what type of flavor you're getting in each taco. Best deal to get is their 3 taco plate--3 tacos, side of rice and beans, and a small drink. My favorite tacos to get are the al pastor and the barbacoa! Another thing to get here are the chips and guac! The chips have always been fresh and just out of being made. The guacamole tastes awesome, it's got a hint of lime, and it adds a perfect amount of zest to it. 

They have plenty of space to fit a good amount of people inside and outside--even with covered outdoor seating in case it rains or is too hot in the sun. They've got a salsa bar inside as well. There's bar seating and a full bar inside, as well as some TVs for you to watch whatever sporting event is on! 

Something to realize though is that their tacos are pretty small because they're street tacos! And that honestly would be the only thing that is going against this place. 

Any time I'm in the area and am feeling tacos, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Ghett' Yo' Taco calls downtown Chandler home for good reason! This is an amazing local business with excellent taste for serving great food and great customer service! The bright and colorful Mexican style of decor in this casa (1920's era), is a happy place to share food and fun w/friends and family! Truly listening to their customers for suggestions on how to make something great even greater! There's a taco for everyone's liking, and the beans and rice are a must! Yo' Ghotta check it out and try Ghett' Yo' Taco, and Yo' Ghotta go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Drake's review. Way too little food for way too much money. Frankly, I've never seen the point of \"street\" tacos, the only kind they sell here. Each one is no larger than an hors d'oeuvre and three of them don't make a meal. You'll wind up ordering several more and/or filling up on rice and beans and tortilla chips. This is more of a cozy meeting place for people on dates who want to drink and talk and are not really interested in dining. Sort of like the Mexican equivalent of a wine bar, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. Sitting outside on a beautiful az day sipping a session lager. The tacos were small flavorless and dry. We had four different flavors, ehh. The tortilla chips were unevenly cooked. Crispy some and chewy some. Salsas were ok."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food and super cute spot. There's plenty of meat per taco, and a great bargain with the meal deals. The pollo verde was bland but it could have been in comparison with the fish and the special (tickle me tinga was amazing. I wasn't totally in love with the carne asada either but the Barbacoa was flavorful. Best guacamole I've had at a restaurant in years though and the churros were the perfect amount of sweet at the end. Definitely adding to our taco rotation!"}
{"text":"Best tacos! The carnitas and the pescado are my favorite. Rice and beans mixed is also excellent. Good deal for the amount of food! Also added on chips and guacamole!"}
{"text":"The tacos are a bit small, but the flavors are definitely there. I typically get anything but chicken when I go out to eat, but was in a particularly chicken-y mood the night we went - I'm glad I ordered a pollo asado taco because it was cooked and seasoned really well and was my favorite taco of the night. The other two (al pastor, wagyu special) were good, but not quite as good. My wife had a few other tacos, one of which was the pescado which had a nice crunch to it and a decently sized portion of fish. The 3 taco + rice/beans + beer special was good value when compared in the context of the individual prices, but is probably 1 or 2 dollars too expensive given how small the tacos are."}
{"text":"Love this addition to Downtown Chandler! Have been a few times now and have tried different things on their menu to say that you cannot go wrong with their street tacos. The meat is always delicious, whether asada, carnitas, grilled shrimp, etc, and the veggies in the tacos as always fresh, crispy and a delightfully complementary of the meats. The tacos do get a bit messy when you eat because the tortillas are street taco sized but I don't mind because that is how street tacos are supposed to be. Also, their housemade queso and chips are yummy and a generous portion. Their lunch specials for $10 with rice and beans are a good value. A casual and delicious experience, I am getting hungry thinking about it!"}
{"text":"My family loved visiting for Taco Tuesday.   The food was great.  The atmosphere was super chill. The service was great.  And i love the hot sauce bar.  
I highly recommend this place for a very tasty laid back place to eat."}
{"text":"Was studying across the street and got hungry for some lunch. My friend and I pulled out our yelp app and checked what's good in that area...we don't go to Downtown Chandler much. We decided to check out this place. The place was super cool! The restaurant itself has a lot of character with the colorful paint and murals. Perfect for instagram photoshoots! Lol. 

They sell street tacos for 2.95. The tacos were actually pretty tiny, but very good!!! For lunch they worker at the bar(owner?) told us they have a special for 3 tacos plus rice and beans and a soda for $10...(good deal!) We chose to skip out on the sugar and extra carbs and got three tacos a la carte. I got the al pastor, carnitas (sooo bomb!), and carne asada (also very good). I enjoyed all three tacos. My friend got the nopales(cactus) and egg taco and pescado(fish) tacos. She also enjoyed her tacos. They have a salsa bar with mild and hot/medium(not sure because I got mild lol)...the salsa was BOMB! 

I would totally go back here to check out the other tacos. They just opened about a week ago. Def a cool spot :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, awesome atmosphere! Enjoyed our tacos and beer on the patio!"}
{"text":"Real Mexican street food. The nopales and egg tacos were amazing. Funky decor which we all loved. And the price is great!"}
{"text":"I always hate to give places reviews that are well below their average. Is something wrong with me?

I got the $10 combo as instructed on Yelp and got the Pescado, Carnitas, and the Carne Asada. All pretty good, the chicken being my least favorite, the fish being my favorite. The wife got veggie.

The tacos were pretty decent. However, I felt for $17 I walked away pretty hungry... and I don't eat a lot. Wife found the veggie tacos to be \"meh.\"

Staff was nice. Food came quick. Place had charm. Just didn't care for the price point. I'd rather go to Fuzzy's which I think has better food and is a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Focused on authentic, fresh food in casual confines just off the Beaton' path in downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"Best tacos I had in a long time!!! The rice and beans are amazing!!! Friendly staff!!! Love the restaurant and the art work!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in awhile!! Loved the rice and beans too. Fuego! This will become a frequent favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's vibrant, welcoming, affordable and there's not a bad taco on the menu. Definitely a great place to hang out, eat good food, have a beer or margarita and relax.  An awesome creative urban addition to Downtown Chandler. I recommend everyone trade their money for tacos here"}
{"text":"Just read about it in San Tan Sun News. Wife had 2 tacos and I had the special of 3 tacos with rice, beans and drink for $10 good deal. Small bag of chips $1.50 fresh made and still warm and very good. Beef taco had one chunk of beef that was a bit tough. Al pastor and chicken were excellent. A little messy cause loaded with toppings. Marinated onions, jalapeños and carrots was as good as I have ever had. Young lady at counter very helpful and positive.WOULD GO BACK."}
{"text":"Best little tacos in town! Friendly staff and cute ambiance.  Big outdoor patio. Love it!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in downtown Chandler. Candy skull murals and a fire place outside if you want to sit outside and still stay warm on the cooler winter nights. 

Great deals for the amount of food you receive. $10 for three tacos of your choice, rice and beans, with a fountain drink. Very filling. 

There is a salsa bar next to the fountain drinks. You are not skimped our on meat in the tacos and the rice and beans were very tasty! Not too dry or runny, just right. If you want a sweet treat to end your meal with, there is a Paletta's Betty cart by the register."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on taco Tuesday. $10 lunch special with three tacos, cup of beans and rice, and a drink. Tacos are street sized tacos, but they were good. My favorite was the \"Bobby Bouche\". Service was friendly. Salsa bar could use more than 3-choices (maybe a Verde sauce/salsa?) Nice lunch place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pretty relaxing and enjoyable. The food was really good, the salsa bar was a touch warm and the tacos could have used more meat. But we had a great dinner and really enjoyed it! We'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"I have really been looking forward to trying this place and it ended up letting me down. 

While I did enjoy that the tacos had double corn tortillas, they were so so tiny for the price. Flavors were mediocre at best. I would say the al pastor was my favorite because of how the pineapple was mixed in with the meat.

They rave about a daily special of three of the tacos with a small side of rice and beans being $10. I really didn't think it was a good deal considijg you're barely getting any food and you most likely will be leaving still hungry. 

Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Love this well needed new taco shop in Downtown Chandler ! My girlfriend & I were just talking about how much we needed one of these in the area. Not only do that have cheap delicious with a modern spin on street tacos... they have a huge mural outside of their dog friendly wrap around patio with a fire place for chilly nights. Super Cool Concept. Can't wait for everyone to see this place. Canned wine and beer! Margaritas and Micheladas ! Even dessert from Paletas Betty ! We will for sure be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for a work function and returned the following afternoon for lunch with my wife. The tacos are amazing. The beans and rice that come with the combo are on point and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty good. I loved the guacamole and chips. I wish they had carne asada burrito on the menu. Nice area as well. I'm definitely a repeating customer."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review after just one visit but I fell in love with this place right away.  When I walked in I felt like I was at a friends house for dinner.  The staff is so friendly and you can tell that a lot of the customers are regulars by their interactions.

The art work in the place is amazing!  I would have taken a bunch of selfies if I wasn't exhausted from work that day.  

I had the special which was 3 tacos, rice and beans, and a fountain drink.  I also ordered a chips and guacamole.  Everything was delicious but I have to say that the guacamole was my favorite!  I did get caught licking the bowl, but I was not going to leave even the tiniest bit of that guacamole!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in AZ! Great $10 lunch special with 3 tacos any style with delicious rice and beans and a drink! Very nice and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"one of the best taco shops I've ever come across. anxious to come back and try some more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance and the food. There were a few mistakes, but they were handled graciously and in my favor. My husband tried the carne asada tacos, which he liked. I tried their specials of the day.. the gobbler (YUM!) and the prickly pear plus a chicken. They made an error and brought me a fish taco instead, but offered up a 4th prickly pear taco. I opted to just try a little PF the prickly pear as I wasn't hungry but was curious. All of the food was excellent, the service courteous and prompt. Loved the Day of the Dead mural too... gorgeous!  I'm sure we will be back when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Seriously my new favorite street taco shop. Great tacos is all you need to know. The $10 special is perfect, add 1.50 for a beer (still a great deal). We sat outside by the fire pit - good service for. Walk up counter. Salsa bar was running low but it was a good addition to the already flavorful tacos. I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"The Tacos here have been awesome and consistant on all 3 of my visits. You can really tell that everything here is made from scratch . The tortillas are warm and everything is popping wih flavor. Do yourself a favor and drive by all the greasy boring taco shops in town and give this place a try, the daily specials are fun and usually have a hilarious bobs burger-esque pun name . 5/5"}
{"text":"A new and fun place! This place just opened and has an awesome atmosphere and great outdoor seating area. The decor is fun and the menu is really simple. Loved the tacos! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Built up an appetite for tacos and this place did not disappoint! It is located in DT Chandler right next to the Perch. The back wall of the building has a colorful Dia De Los Muertos mural that is gorgeous. I noticed there was a smoking area and ashtrays on the outside patio away from the entrance. A few patrons sitting outside-one was a furry guy that liked laying on the ground. 

Menus are at the bar and you order then choose a seat, put your number up on the metal stand and they bring your food out to you. It was crowded and there was interesting mix of people, young, old, people having drinks at the bar, even some cops having a taco break. 

I ordered the meal-3 tacos, rice and beans, and a Devils Ale for $13ish. Carne asada, Pollo, and pastor were my choices and they were all delicious. They are Street taco size. Added salsa and lime from the salsa bar and it was perfect. Chips with guac, cheese dip were also yummy. Or small group enjoyed the entire experience, from the artistic, barrio style establishment, to the awesome food and service. In tacos we trust! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cool local taco place. Tacos are real small, but the guy did say that. They weren't amazing, but they were good. Good prices too, $10 for three tiny tacos with a side of beans and rice with a soft drink. The service was really friendly and quick. It really was the perfect ghetto atmosphere, a little shady looking from the outside, but clean and well managed on the inside. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My mom and I last night were trying to figure out what to eat last night rather than our usual spot for tacos. I came across my bookmarked and suggested we go to Ghett Yo Taco! 

We get there parking is great. We were greeted as soon as we walked into the restaurant. He explained the menu perfectly and made some suggestions as well since it was our first time. We ordered the guacamole and queso dip to share with a bag of homemade chips. Queso is my absolute favorite to order anywhere and this queso was soooo good! 

For my meal I ordered the 3 taco combo that comes with a side of rice over beans. The tacos I ordered were Al Pastor, shredded chicken with chili verde, and barbacoa. They were all phenomenal! I especially loved the rice over beans, they were so flavorful and made perfect. 

The ambience and vibe in this restaurant was great. I love the spots where you don't have to feel rushed. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Everything was so good and the staff was so nice and helpful ! We ate outside on their patio and it was simply perfect. Really cool artwork and stained glass. Super unique and super tasty."}
{"text":"On our way to go to The Perch we noticed this place next to it and decided to give it a try. We are SO happy we did. We got the 3 taco meal that comes with rice and beans.  We got all different kinds of tacos and each one was just as good as the one before it! The rice and beans were perfect as well.  The service was awesome and the people that work here are so friendly. We will be coming here again and will be spreading the word!"}
{"text":"There is very cool artwork on the outside of the restaurant. There is some seating inside and plenty more outside, which is perfect for the warm Arizona winter. You can tell that they put a ton of work in this place.

My problem is that the food is supremely overrated. I was very disappointed after reading all of the reviews. I had the carne asada and al pastor tacos. The carne asada just tasted burnt, and the pork had little flavor--the focus was all on the pineapple. Both salsas from the salsa bar were also underwhelming. I did not try the fish taco myself, but my family thought it was so-so. They did like the barbacoa taco, so that might be worth trying if you go here. The only thing that I thought was at all above-average was the cup of rice and beans that came with the combo. 

It also costs way too much for what it is at almost $3 per 4\" street taco. While I do love to support small businesses, I will probably look for another taco spot when I return to Chandler."}
{"text":"Walked in on Cinco de Mayo for a quick meal and sat down at one of the tables to order. Servers (there were several around) didn't even come over to check if I wanted to order. 

When I did order, servers did not come over to me to ask if the food was okay or if I wanted anything else. It was not super busy. Your young staff needs some work on customer service.

There were also flies all over the place. Some landed on my food."}
{"text":"This place is solid if you're looking for yummy little street tacos.  The menu is small and simple which I love.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I've added this place to my short list for Taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch.  They weren't too busy.  The guy behind the bar was the owner, apparently.  Friendly enough.  No problems there.  You walk up to the bar and order (and pay), then go sit down.  Or at least that's what we did.  As the name implies, they do tacos.  No enchiladas, no burritos, no mole.  Just tacos.

The best deal appears to be the \"combo\".  You get three tacos, plus rice/beans (they are in the same bowl), plus a drink.  Note that these are soft tacos.  Our table got three combos which allowed us to sample most of their choices.  The carne asada, the carnitas, the fish, the el pastor, the chicken, and I forget now the daily special taco we ordered.  They were all very simple, but very good.

When the trays were first brought to us I was thinking \"these are too small\" but they really stuffed the meat into them.  So the portion size was pretty reasonable.  I don't feel like they cheated me on quantity.  You could get more for less money at Taco Bell, but this ain't no Taco Bell.  The flavors were really good, and the ingredients all appeared to be very fresh.

The beans were not refried, but more like a pinto in a gravy.  Nothing extraordinary, but good.  The rice also was good.  We also got chips, salsa, and guacamole.  The chips were warm, and the salsa and guac were both really good.  For what this place is I don't think you can do much better.  Highly recommended for anyone wanting some great tacos.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the cutest taco joint in Chandler downtown.
Simple menu, taco, guacamole and chips, rice and beans, fountain drinks and beers. Fresh ingredients, made to order food are super tasty!
Just get the $10 combo, your pick of 3 tacos (beef, pork, chicken or fish), rice and beans, and a fountain drink. Great deal!
Small restaurant, nice patio around. Beautiful art works, laid back ambiance. It's a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"TL;DR: the food is great, the wait is not. 

FANTASTIC FOOD. I'm a vegetarian, there's only one option, but it's enough. I eat here way too much. Here's the catch: the service can be very spotty. I am often told on the phone that the wait for my food will be ten minutes, but it is often closer to 20 or 30 minutes. I've called and been put on hold for five minutes while the server forgets that I'm on hold (I can hear him chatting with the cook in the back). I'd just like to be given an accurate time estimate."}
{"text":"First time trying this place tonight, definitely going back. Wife and I both totally loved the tacos! And the michelada was a bonus, you have to try it here!!  Great food, great service, great people. Also great location if you want to walk around afterwards for some more night-life after dinner on a weekend. See you again soon Ghett Yo Taco!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great prices. Everything made fresh to order. I look forward to seeing what the next special is as they always bring something new to the table"}
{"text":"Tasty tacos to munch on: fish and carnitas.  Beans-n-rice were oh so nice. Had a unique, good flavor to them.  A couple of small tables indoors and outdoors.   These are small street tacos, around $3 each, but have good flavors to savor."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco place. The Barbacoa tacos are my personal favorite and my fiance and I love the guacamole and the chips. Very reasonable prices too especially when they have special combos with rice and beans. The tacos are small but they are very filling and three is plenty enough especially if you are adding rice and beans or guac and chips. I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for tacos and in downtown chandler, you should stop by and check out their tacos. It's right next to the Perch and has this giant mural on the side of the shop. They have seating inside and outside and I was surprised by the amount of seating this place had. When I was looking on yelp it didn't look like this place had a lot of seating and I was kinda worried that we would have to wait long since we came on a Saturday evening for dinner. However that wasn't the case and we were able to order and sit down right away. I ordered a carne asada and fish taco and my husband got the carne asada, green chili and fish tacos. They're street tacos so it's smaller then regular tacos . I would recommend getting the meal of 3 tacos because it comes with a drink and a side of beans & rice mixed. You can ask for the rice and bean to be separate but I feel like you usually end up mixing the two together anyways so we didn't mind. We also got an order of chips and guacamole and a small cheese quesadilla for our son. The tacos had good flavor and we enjoyed our meal. The rice and beans were a bit on the saltier side but still good. I do wish this place offered more variety in salsa. They only offered mild, hot and pico de gallo. It would have been better if they offered some green salsa and some jalapeños for those who like some extra spice. Overall we enjoyed our food and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"You need a taco AND you need to go to Ghett Yo Taco. First of all, NO where will you get this quality of food at this price unless you are getting it for free. The prices are small and the tacos are delish. You must come and enjoy. They have creative and well-matched flavors with a wide selection of beer. Come and enjoy. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Good food friendly faces,  love the ambience, very homey feeling at the dining area"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Excellent food, tacos, and beers.  Family owned and operated.  Always working hard and very good food.  I would recommend this place.   Christian will bend over backwards to make your experience excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean restaurant, and friendly staff.  You have to give it a try.

The location isn't great for drive-by traffic, but for me that's part of the allure; I like great little family owned shops tucked away like this, and I've been trying to go about once per week for lunch.  I think the tacos are similar to the style of Joy Ride in Gilbert, just as tasty but much more affordable.

In addition to the main menu tacos, there are usually 4 or so daily specials like barbacoa and green chili chicken.  One day they were doing this cubano style taco that was great, so I hope they bring that back.  Today they had the \"chile relleno-you-didn't\" taco (I appreciate the Bob's Burger's reference) which was fun.

Literally my ONLY complaint is that sometimes the Al Pastor can have more fat than I like.  

I really hope others give this place a try and support our local businesses."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Lunch with a girlfriend on the patio. Great experience. Attentive and very pleasant employees. Great first visit and I will be back."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are so bomb. I regret not getting 3 fish tacos for lunch. I had carne asada taco, chicken taco, and fish taco. That fish taco was deep fried and just AMAZING. The others were pretty flavorful too! Lunch combo includes 3 tacos of choice, rice and beans, and a drink. I opted for $3 churros as well because why not. Total meal came out to be $18ish.
I usually don't eat a lot, so all that food made me pretty full and satisfied, after finishing everything. But if you're someone with a regular appetite, you may still be hungry afterward. And $18 is a bit steep  for someone to be leaving still hungry.
The churros are made fresh in house. Unfortunately mine were kinda burnt and hollowed. I mean they were decent, slightly too crunchy so probs not gonna get it again next time."}
{"text":"Amazing Food. My husband and I will definitely be back for sure! The Tacos were great my ONLY complaint would be the dry tortillas I would suggest heating them with a little oil on the comal that's it! The rice & beans SO GOOD! Salsa was good too wish we would've ordered chips, next time! The music playing was perfect & the art around the place was even better! Just a great vibe! Oh yeah and the guy who took our order excellent customer service!! Icing on the cake! Or salsa on the taco?.... lol"}
{"text":"I went here twice this weekend! I fell in love with the guacamole and chips on the first trip! I'm sensitive to salt so I wasn't in love with the green chili tacos or the beans and rice. But that guac though... so I went again, had two carne asada and one chicken taco in the $10 deal=3 tacos, rice and beans and a drink. Today, it was delicious! Everything was great and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little taco joint and friendly staff and great service. Price is good for a positive experience"}
{"text":"El Pastor is amazing!! Whomever said the tacos were small it ridiculous. The muncher meal is amazing, and the best prices too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at an unbeatable price. Amanda was friendly, too! I'll certainly be a return customer.  Good luck,  Christian!"}
{"text":"I've lost all faith in online reviews and other people's recommendations. You've got a 4.9 on Google??? This has to be all your networking friends.

First off, I'd like to say I liked the remodel of the building and the employees were very nice. 

 I hate to be the first one to leave you a 1 star,  but your tacos were the most unauthentic tacos I've ever had. I sincerely mean that. I actually left after eating the tacos here and went to another taco stand afterwards. 

 You buy your meat pre prepared like we all can from Food City. Your salsa tasted like El Paso; probably bought from Restaurant Depot. The tortillas... you didn't even grill the tortillas?! You served them right out of the bag at room temperature. You're obviously here for the money like some of the other Chandler restaurant owners. You should raise your prices while you're at it. I bet these dumb people would still come and be thrilled with the imitation product. I'll have to give this Ghett' Yo Tacos some serious props for their choice of location, because the locals don't know what real street tacos are."}
{"text":"Tried here for lunch with my son yesterday. Tasty tacos. I had the green chili chicken. Had a real good flavor. Tacos are on the smaller side, which is good if you want to mix and match. The guac was very tasty. The kids quesadilla was small, but perfect size for my toddler. We sat outside on the covered patio which was nice except it sounded like deranged birds arounds us (from another restaurant). I was assured we were safe sitting there and we were in fact able to eat our lunch without being in an Alfred Hitchcock movie."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! I ordered the pescado tacos and my husband ordered the carne asada tacos. It was a little pricey considering the amount of food that came but I believe you are probably paying a little for the real estate. It's not cheap to be in the center of downtown.  The chips were hot and amazing and the salsa is delicious as well.  Definitely a step up from a regular old street taco for sure.  Love the art work too."}
{"text":"Super Hip place with some of the best food around. Every time I come into here I always get whatever their \"special taco\" is for that day. Super friendly people with great service."}
{"text":"Good remodel in the old yoli's cafe spot. 3 bite tacos and cold beer will make this popular spot. Don't be afraid to staff correctly and make customer service a priority."}
{"text":"Loved the food, mural and vibe here! Awesome price point for casual, delicious food. We loved the quesadilla, queso, chicken and carnitas tacos, and Paletas de Betty for dessert. Service at counter could be quicker, but I'm sure that will improve as restaurant gets in their groove."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and the tacos were authentic and delicious! My favorite were the carnitas tacos and beans. They mainly just serve tacos and the prices are higher then other taco shops but they are delicious. Staff is super nice and helpful. It is a small spot and may be hard to find but you can't miss the beautiful graffiti mural on the side of the building. They have a designated parking lot for costumers."}
{"text":"Just stopped into this new place, used to be a nice breakfast spot but we had to check out what it has become. You definitely need to come here and give this place a try. Just got 3 tacos, rice and beens and a beer for $12 and the tacos were very much on point. They also have a nice salsa bar if you need a little extra spice! 

Side note the people are super friendly and care what you think about the food!"}
{"text":"In the middle of a fuc@n getto wasteland...wasn't sure if we were in the right city. This place is for locals only and that's who's eating there because they know how incredible this place is. 10 bucks, 3 different delectable tacos, drinks and beans and rice mix. We had a really enjoyable meal so if I may suggest, pony up and be a local. It's very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Went today, we were excited about trying something new. 
We went in, the servers were not friendly, they acted as if we bothered them, sat down and maybe 10 minutes later acknowledged. We ordered chips and guacamole, with the 3 tacos and beans/rice meal. 
The chips were good, the beans and rice were amazing, but I was not to impressed with the tacos. The tortillas were cold and they were pretty small, tacos were okay, not something we would recommend. 
The servers did a poor job of explaining the menu, like I mentioned above we were not acknowledged, even though no customers were around."}
{"text":"I finally checked out this place with my boyfriend after seeing a good amount of hype on social media. Overall, I was pretty satisfied. Customer service was good- we were greeted and asked if we've eaten there before. The person taking our orders also explained what was in the tacos and gave some recommendations, which was helpful. My boyfriend and I each ordered the daily special, and the price was decent for what we ate. Their daily special, which consists of 3 tacos, a fountain drink, and a small side of rice and beans, was delicious and flavorful. I ordered the Cuban crisis, pescado, and pollo asada tacos, and my favorite was the pescado!  However, don't expect to be full from ordering just the daily special. Since the tacos alone aren't very filling, it would be nice if the portion size of rice and beans was larger. 
In terms of location, it is located on the edge of Downtown Chandler, which is nice because it seems to be less congested than other parts of Downtown Chandler. I initially parked in that public  parking lot and walked over,  but I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that they have their own parking lot! Small yet convenient. A place I would like to come back to again!

Also, on Groupon there is a 25% cash back deal on your first purchase for this place! Not certain of when it ends, but it is only available for a limited time."}
{"text":"The food is good but outrageously expensive. 3 tiny little street tacos, small bowl of rice and beans and a soda for over 10 bucks ? I will admit the food tasted good but definitely not worth the money. Also the food is not authentic in anyway so don't expect it to be actual Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, and great place to Ghett' Yo' Tacos!! We tried almost every taco on the menu and all were amazing! Chips were fresh and salsa was tasty! There are also a variety of beers to choose from! $1.00 off all Tacos on Tuesday's! We'll be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick meal when near downtown Chandler. Al Pastore and Carnitas tacos were awesome. The pickled veg was really good too. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has bomb real Mexican style tacos. It was clean and not crowded with a nice little patio space to sit. It was a bit pricey and the birds squawking next door from The Perch Bar was a little annoying, but also somewhat amusing (after a margarita). But the food was so good, I'd come back."}
{"text":"The best tacos around! The barbacoa is insane. The meat was super tender and delicious. The al pastor was our second favorite. Also don't pass up the nopales when they have it. We are so excited we found this place."}
{"text":"Great street tacos... We tried all 6 and loved them all. Carnitas was our favorite... also the special with their local beer is a great value. If you don't want the local beer you can get a bucket (5 beers) for $12 bucks... 3 tacos, rice and beans for $10... good little local spot. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious.  New restaurant in downtown Chandler.   The tacos are outstanding.  Carne Asada was top notch as was the nightly special of green chili chicken.  Beans and rice are very good.  Special menu item, just ask for it, the queso.  I could have eaten a gallon of it.  Plus the fresh, warm tortilla chips and homemade salsa.  Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Very good tacos and great service not to mention the atmosphere is awesome, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What can you really say about this place other than you have to see it for yourself.  Yes, the tacos were tasty (between everyone at the table I tried them all) but the mural on the back patio is worth a visit alone! Very chill atmosphere, kind and attentive staff.  We joked about wanting to come back again the next day for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once with some women from my Bible study.  I had 3 different street tacos - can't remember them but one was beef, the other pork, and the other fish.  All were good.  It was the special that came with rice and beans.

I'll be back, hopefully with my husband and/or kids.  Service was fast - for lunch around open.  Simple, delish food, reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great new taco spot!!! Food was good and simple. Tacos and Beans and Rice for Taco Tuesday!  Staff friendly and service was great. Fast.."}
{"text":"I was told about this place by a friend who had recently been there.  This place is very relaxed with really good tacos and a great beer selection.  I had a 3 taco combo: Cuban, al carbon and fried pescado.

The fish taco was fresh.  The batter and toppings were perfect and SoCal style. I recommend.
The al Carbon was good as well but the Cuban was really interesting with pork grilled on flat top, still moist but the edges were carmalized and slightly crispy.  They added toppings and pickled onion I think with a creamy topping that I really enjoyed.  I had to go back for a second Sessions Mexican lager and Cuban taco. 

The location is small and unassuming but you will know your there when you see the 2 big heads mural on the front.  It's behind the Perch.  Next time skip the Perch and swing in for some excellent tacos.  Ask to talk to Pete, he's the owner... he hung out with us and had a beer by the fire pit while we gorged ourselves on tacos."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the hubby today. It was delicious. We both got the meal deal which was 3 street tacos, rice mixed with beans, and a fountain drink.  I had the Al pastor, green chili chicken, and carnitas. My husband had pollo asada, carnitas, napales and eggs, and carna asada.  Taco flavors we're just right, the pastor had fresh pineapples on top and the others were just a well topped. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had this taco shop bookmarked for a while now & was excited to try it! It definitely lived up to my expectations. The restaurant was clean and well decorated. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful since it was my first time here. I always get nervous when I am ordering at a new place but they gave me recommendations and made me super comfortable! They have a lot of deals too to make sure you get the best bang for your buck. The tacos were incredible! I got carne asada and al pastor and I loved them both! They have a small salsa bar for your food which makes it easy to have them how you like. They accidentally gave us a wrong taco but fixed it quickly and remained super professional. We also got chips and queso which were a great side to split between the two of us and to eat while we waited for our food. Will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting AZ and had a Taco-Adventure that I was on! This was the 6th out of 6 stops that I had on my taco agenda week long adventure. It was taco Tuesday and I believe it is  I was almost skeptical since it would be my last stop, but it did not disappoint! Everything was delicious and very fresh and flavorful! I had carne asada, shredded beef and a shredded chicken that was on special and they were all sooo good! I also had a side of beans which would probably make it on my top five list! It had a great flavor with some bacon in it! I tried the chips and queso, which were good, but not the best. The salsa bar was good and all the sauces had good flavor! We also ordered the mini chimis and they were sweet and delicious as well! Will definitely be back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood taco joint! My husband and I love tacos and are excited for this new business. I love that it's near downtown Chandler but it's a little away from everything so you don't have to deal with the crowd. Its kinda like a hidden gem.
I had the carne asada and pollo asado tacos both were good. It came with rice mixed with beans which I wasn't excited about. 
I met the owner Christian and his father Peter. Both were very nice. The customer service and kindness was beyond what I expected! 
I will definitely come back and bring friends too!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are in town for a wedding and love a good taco. Checked yelp in our area and found this gem of a place. We are from NYC and if this place was in Williamsburg, they would be a hit. They serve a amazing carnitas street taco. I highly recommend the queso and of a course a house margarita! Coming back before we leave."}
{"text":"Great, great tacos! I went in for lunch and went with the \"meal deal\" (3 tacos w/ rice & beans). First off, I gotta tell you the rice and beans are delicious. They're not your traditional Spanish rice with a glob of refried beans; instead, it's a delicious mixture of both, in a cup, slow cooked w/ bacon and jalapeños...YUM! My taco choices were carne asada, a chicken and the special, which was chorizo. Again, really really tasty. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fun new casual street taco joint in the old yolis space. Great tacos fun place. Come check it out"}
{"text":"Ghett Yo Taco is good and a cute spot for some cheap food. The service was quick, the ambiance was cool, and the tacos were good. Not the best I have ever had, but good enough. I ordered the fish tacos and they were a bit bland. 

The beans and rice was very good - the rice comes on top of the beans in a little cup, and they taste great when mixed together."}
{"text":"Great spot for families and friends. The menu is simple but everything on it is delicious. We went with a group and tried one of every taco and nobody was disappointed. They have a set taco menu and then specials as well. The patio is perfect for this time of year and service was friendly and attentive. It's a winner!"}
{"text":"They have a nice 3-tacos + rice + beans + fountain drink for $10.x which is a good sampler.
The Muncher Special for the day was awesome, the Pescado was a little bit greasy, and the pollo was ok."}
{"text":"Ghett Yo is my favorite place for fish tacos, hot fresh chips and guacamole. Suggested to me by a fellow Yelp friend this locals joint is a great deal with the 3 tacos (you pick the flavors) with a drink and rice w/beans for $10. Add a dime bag of made to order chips and a side of guacamole and you can eat for less than $13.

They always have a special taco available which I have tried but I can't pass up the fish tacos. Everyone I have brought here has been equally impressed. Carna asada, carnitas and chicken tacos are also good. 

These are small soft street tacos, not your deep fried crispy variety and they are delicious! Go on a Tuesday and get $2 tacos!

The fish tacos and guacamole are very popular so don't be surprised if they run out, but don't let that discourage you. Try them the next time because they really are worth it!"}
{"text":"Cool design but the carne asada taco meat was dry and flavorless  I wish the woman who took our order asked what we wanted on them (which is common) because i dislike cabbage & radishes. So as i took those toppings off, the cheese came off too. 
But its a good thing we got 1 Cuban crisis taco each (or wtv its called) because those were pretty good. The mustard throws it off a bit but at least they had more flavor. 
Also, the rice and beans come together in a little bowl which again i wish we knew. If youre not a big bean eater then you cant really enjoy the rice because its all soaked with bean juice lol. Oh, and the beans are cooked with meat which added a weird flavor. Why cant they just simply be rice and beans? 


Probably wont come back. Spent $20 for 2 people and left hungry and dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Yum! 
Yum!
Yum!
This place is so good. Nestled in downtown Chandler with a super cool mural on their west side wall. The beans and rice come mixed together (or separate if you want). My favorite street taco is the fish taco. The Guac & the cheese dip have won my heart"}
{"text":"A few of us enjoyed the 3-taco meal deal, not too bad.  Tacos (carne asada and carnitas) were very good.  The place was nice and clean too, not too busy for a Friday night.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Went during lunch so it was pretty busy but service was fast and welcoming! Rice was kind of dry but still delicious when mixed in with the beans. Tacos are amazing! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Looks like it is mostly to catch overflow business from the nearby bars with no thought to comfort or amenities. Not the beat tacos for the price. Average all around."}
{"text":"A good place to grab decent tacos and a beer. The staff is always friendly. However the staff needs to spend less time entertaining their friends that are visiting. And could probably use more training on food handling."}
{"text":"Best tacos for he money in AZ!!!  Great hole in the wall place with an adequate beer selection. I didn't have any mixed drinks or their margarita and I did not see anyone else drinking mixed cocktails. Highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great taco joint close by. Good food, staff is nice and place is clean and accommodating. Family friendly. I went for a quick lunch date with hubby and it wS great. We got a chicken, al pastor and nopales tacos. I loved the cheese they used. Chips and salsa very tasty too. Good local joint. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good taco's for a great price. My favorite combination. Staff is very good as well."}
{"text":"Great taco place with a trendy environment. We had the three taco special. Your choice of any three tacos, rice & beans, and a drink for $10! I'd recommend the fish taco."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch and ordered tacos with rice & beans. They were all very good and had awesome flavor!"}
{"text":"Okay you have to go to this place if you want some legit street tacos! Don't judge a book by its cover! Inexpensive, full, and delicious tacos. I loved the hot chips and guacamole. Even the salsa was delicious. I was just sad the containers were almost empty so we were only able to try one of the salsas. Between the husband and I we had a variety of tacos. When they have a three taco special with rice and beans with a soda you can't say no. We had the carne asada, carnitas, pescado, Cuban, chicken, and al pastor. 
The only disappointment were the beans were salty for my taste. But will be back for sure and will try the quest next time"}
{"text":"Lol I wanted to take a photo of how great the food looks but we ate it so quickly because it's that tasty. You gotta try the cactus taco. Mind blowing. Great classic like pastor too!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, delicious tacos. Sit at the bar and chat with the staff. I had the carnitas taco and the huevos y nopales. Both are really good.  And any house beer for $1.50 is awesome when they have so many choices."}
{"text":"Took my family (3) to try this new Taco place. We each had the special of 3 walking tacos ea. chips and a side of guack. Wife and I each had a beer and daughter had a coke.  The Tacos were great!  My only complaint has to be the price and why I'm only giving 3 stars. For a total of 9 walking taco's, 2 beers, a soda and a side of Guack was $48! Not sure I will be back when I can go down the road and spend half that price."}
{"text":"This is an awesome hidden gem in downtown Chandler.  When pulling up to it at night just look for the building with the lights since its in a neighborhood of houses it can blend in.

From getting out of our car walking in you get a nice vibe to the place, with outdoor seating that had a fire pit type style to sit next to or around.  The staff was very friendly and helpful since it was our first time here.

The tacos are very good and they also have a special taco that they make and it doesn't disappoint.  Full of flavor and color and taste amazing that you want to keep ordering from here.  They do have a good beer selection since tacos do go well with beer.

The walls of the building are also decorative and give a nice pop to the place when coming to visit."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, we loved it! Nice variety of tacos, excellent guacamole! Nice sitting area outside."}
{"text":"Best taco I've ever have!!
Friendly service,nice chill environment and the most important is the great food here!
Weekly special menu and secret menu is amazing.  Oh and lots selected beer and fresh made margaritas!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this new addition to Downtown Chandler! An incredible value, top quality ingredients at a more than reasonable price.  Love the creativity with the Muncher Special and appreciate the house brews being something other than the big domestic brewers.  A definite must try if you haven't been there and we'll continue to frequent weekly!"}
{"text":"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly: 
The Good: We ordered 2 carnitas, 2 chicken, and 2 carne asada tacos, 2 orders of beans, a \"dime bag\" of chips, one soda, and one beer. The food was outstanding. The carnitas was our favorite. 
The Bad: These street tacos were $2.95 each! Yes, they are good, but not worth almost three bucks a piece. The entire order was almost $30. for lunch. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't over priced. 
The Ugly: I know why this is called \"Ghett Yo Taco\" because it is quite frankly in the ghetto. The neighborhood is severely run down."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to Yelp you!!! Ghett Yo Taco was absolutely wonderful. The tacos of the day - an uber flavorful green chile chicken and a nopales/egg combination won me over. Hubby had a few other tacos that made us fans for life. Please don't leave Ghett Yo!!! We Love You."}
