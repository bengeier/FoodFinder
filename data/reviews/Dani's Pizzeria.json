{"text":"Grew up (1994) with the same Greek man making Lasalle's (possibly Montreal's) best poutine and pizza. Left Canada and returned in 2009 to find Danis still there with the same man making great fast food!  Their pizza is layered with cut up pepperoni., the sauce and crust is like no other fast food place I've been to. They also must be the place that had (possible stil has) a tomato flavoured sauce for their poutine (Italian style). It tastes awsome."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, great atmosphere, it's one of the best places to go to in Lasalle. Doesn't matter if you're in the mood for pizza, sandwiches or even souvlaki, they do it all well. Dani's is by far one of my favourite places to go to!"}
{"text":"Been going there for over twenty five years. Awesome service and great people. You must try their pizza, best in lasalle and chef salad (choice of dressing : liquid). Delivery is quick and you cannot be diss appointed!"}
{"text":"Now, I don't know if this was just an off night for them. But it was definitely my first and last time eating their pizza.  Place has great reviews but to me, this was the worst restaurant pizza I've ever had.  The dough was identical in flavour and texture to that of a frozen bake at home pizza. Cardboardy and flavourless. Not soft, chewy and tasty like it should be. If they do in fact use frozen pre-made dough, shame on them.  Also there was this strange gravy smell and after taste. I was hungry and had paid for it so I ate it. But it's one of those times where, with each bite, you're thinking you hope you don't get sick! I will not be finishing the leftovers.  Extremely disappointing and puzzling given all the good reviews."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Lasalle / Verdun!!!  Punto."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant in Lasalle.  I rarely eat there. I mostly get delivery which is very fast, they have never made a mistake with my order, phone service is very friendly and the food is never disappointing!  You will have to go back a few times because the chicken pita, cheeseburger (boyfriends fav), chicken platter ( the potatoes are outstanding) and poutine are excellent!  And it is priced right."}
{"text":"This used to be a solid 5-star pizza. Quality of ingredients and pizza in general has slipped of late."}
{"text":"They make a pretty unique and filling meatball sub, (not full round meatballs - more like crumbled seasoned meat). The cooked fresh mushrooms were requested on the side. They were a nice addition to the tomato based sauce. I love mushrooms. Since there is only a $1 difference between the large 14\" and small 10\" sub - still sizable (the small comes with fries), make sure you specify the size. The delivery order arrived with the small size plus and extra fry which was a mistake as again the large comes with fries. Upon calling to the owner to let them know they were attentive to the error and seemed to care. Due to this, I have kept the 5 star rating, as this old school establishment deserves the benefit of the doubt. It turns out they opened in 1984, so it's not 30 yet."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Dani's for over 10 years. I love their gyros and rice with lemon sauce. It's a definite must try!!! Their poutine sauce and cheese is very delicious but unfortunately their fries aren't that great. They taste like their frozen French fries and only recently have I've been getting them slightly undercooked, which made them a lot less tolerable to eat. Regardless though, I always come back for their yummy gyros and rice ( with lemon sauce)!"}
