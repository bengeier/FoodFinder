{"text":"Been here for lunch on a Thursday, everything tasted so bland, and too much rice for the maki. The salad dressing tasted bad, and  the worse was that I found a piece of tinsel in my salad.   For the dynamite rolls, other restaurants they made them spicy, this restaurant I have to add $1.00 to make it spicy.  If I order a spicy mayo aside it is only 50 cent.  What a rip off.   They copy New Generation's menu, NG's lunch special cost $5.99, they charge $6.99 ($7.90 after tax).  I can have much better meals at that price."}
{"text":"It's a cheap, dingy, dirty chinese people run sushi restaurant. It's the cheapest sushi place on campus, so I used to go there often until I realized I was wasting my time and money. They got my order wrong too. I wouldn't recommend this place, save your time and a bad experience."}
{"text":"Top sushi is a weird kind of place. It seems to be somewhat confused as to where it falls in the classy scale.  It's not dirt-cheap, but it's not really all that nice either.  They're not all that busy either, but they seem to have some strict rules about seating. If you go at a non-busy time as a couple, they will seat you at a tiny table with two seats (which, let's face it, are really for individual diners), even if the rest of the larger tables go unoccupied. I don't understand why they would trade customer satisfaction for the remote chance that you'll be swamped. In fact, they had one of the staff sitting in a booth for 6 people alone with a laptop. I know, I know. Two diners, table for two, what's the big deal? Well, why not a table for 4? Especially since their meals usually come with a salad, a soup, little plates, soy sauce dishes, etc, etc.  Their portions are pretty huge, and I haven't gotten sick from eating here yet.  Verdict: good enough"}
{"text":"\"top sushi\".  More like \"top poopi\" because realistically the food here gets to me every time.   pros: Being a Uoft student, this place is really convenient in terms of getting a quick,  cheap lunch. Only come here for lunch. The lunch menu is what makes this place. For 6.99 you get a choice of at least like 9 entr√©es. In particular, the teriyaki chicken and pork katsu are good choices.   cons: The service is pretty shoddy if you get any at all. Also, despite the name, the sushi is exactly what you come here not to get."}
{"text":"Cheap but not Cheerful (nor Clean)  Like alot of other Reviewers have said it's cheap, but not that cheap, and yet it looks cheap (in a bad way I mean).... and ofcourse it's busy due to proximity to UofT for a quick kinda-cheap lunch.   Now if I'd just gone in, had my $7 lunch and left my review would rate a 3 - sushi kinda bland, nothing special but does the job (the $4 prepacked Sushi stuff I sometimes buy for lunch from NoFrills or Loblaws actually tastes slightly more fresh and flavourful).  But nooooo instead I made the fatal mistake of going in, ordering, then going to Washroom to wash my hands. I always say you can tell alot about a Restaurant by the state of it's Washrooms/back areas...the stairs to them were disgustingly gross and squalid, the Washroom equally gross and depressing. A $30 can of paint and abit of elbow grease and cleanup could solve this problem, but it's the lack of cleanliness that really worries me. By the time I got back to the table I thought \"oh maybe my hands were actually cleaner before I went down there\" .  So then I ate my lunch with great reluctance and quickly paid and left. I rate this place only a 2.0-2.5 at  best."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and had the all you can eat special. Not only was the food subpar, but they didn't even bring all of it.  Never stepping foot here again!"}
{"text":"Walking into Top Sushi I really didnt expect much considering it was right across the street from the University of Toronto campus. However, it was worse than i thought it would be. A friend and I went in there to have lunch. The bento boxes were horrible. Basically didnt eat anything. The place was basically empty however the service was slow and inattentive. I will not recommend this place to anyone, unless you are just looking to feed yourself for a cheap dollar. I give them the credit for offering good prices, but quality of food is unbelievably low.   I did drop in at Top Sushi, a couple times before to have their fresh fruit slush. This was really really good!!! I enjoyed those drinks a lot, and for the price that they are offered it, it is worth it for sure, since they use fresh fruit. The bubble tea was more disappointing as you can taste the powder that was used to make it. Went in again for fresh fruit slush, and most of the flavors I wanted weren't offered, and the same thing happened the next time i went in."}
{"text":"Top sushi this is not. While the lunch specials are pretty cheap, you get what you pay for. Low quality and poorly prepared, but it's at least quick, so it might be fine if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I came here with a group for a friend's birthday and I think we all agreed that our experience wasn't even decent at best. We went to the upstairs dining area because we came in a large party, but we came to find that it was a bit of a shabby environment. There were random birthday decorations strewn about along the walls, which we thought was because we came for a birthday gathering. However, that wasn't the case because you could clearly see that the balloons were droopy and deflated and the decor faded as if they put these things up ages ago and just never bothered to take them down.  As for the food, there were only a few things that were memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. One of our main complaints was that the seaweed salad because it was anything but that. One of the people in our group was vegan so when she received a salad with lettuce drenched in some kind of creamy dressing (assuming to be thousand island) with a sprinkling of dried seaweed on top, she was incredibly displeased. My friends and I decided to order bubble tea with our meal, which we immediately regretted after one sip. The best description I can give is that these drinks were basically powdered, colored water with undercooked tapioca. It was by far the worst bubble tea I had ever drank.   Overall, I'd say stay away from this place because the student discount and the convenient location near the UofT campus just doesn't make it worth coming here."}
{"text":"This review is for a Delivery Order.   I was drawn to try this Sushi place because it offered quite a variety and let's face it, why not try something new. The online order (via Just-Eat) was very user friendly and I loved that I was able to use Interac to pay for it (although I think this is more Just eat and less about the restaurant.)  The food arrived 1 hour 10 minutes after I ordered and I don't think the price was all that steep considering what I ordered. I got Spicy Tuna Roll, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Sushi Combo and Stir fried veggies (not all for me!). The total with delivery was around $30. I think it's a comparable rate to other Sushi joints in this city.  As for the food, it was fine. I found the Stir Fried veggies to be salty. The Spicy Tuna roll was good but not all that spicy. The side salad came with three SMALL leaves which seems like such a waste of Styrofoam! I wish they would have proved the other reviews wrong but they were just okay. I would only order it again if I didn't have any other option, but I would eat it again (that's saying something right?)"}
{"text":"Decent, cheap sushi if you're in a rush and they cater to students as its right across UofT campus. They have 7.99 lunch specials which are a steal. Usually include a roll or two, miso soup and salad. If you're not in the sushi mood, you can get teriyaki/tempura with miso soup and salad for 7.99 as well.   Haven't always felt the greatest after eating here though so tends to be low on my list when looking for lunch options."}
{"text":"The bad reviews for Top Sushi make me sad, since I think it delivers exactly what you would expect from a cheap sushi place. It probably deserves 3.5 stars, but I'm giving it 4 in solidarity.  I'm a big believer that we have to compare restaurants to others in their class and by that standard, Top Sushi is great.  It's made my lunchtime way better than it used to be when all I had on that strip was Subway.  If you are familiar with the family of sushi restaurants on Bloor Street (New Generation, Sushi on Bloor, etc.), Top Sushi is almost an exact replica and does a great job of copying.   I work right around the corner from these guys and have eaten lunch there frequently.  Sushi is consistently fresh.  I especially like their spicy tuna rolls (with tempura bits and not-very-spicy mayo) and their yam tempura maki (crispy tampura batter paired with melty yam and avocado).  Service is completely average, perhaps a bit better than average, and the food is cheap.    Today, I ordered a sushi platter for 7 people that I was hosting at work and they allowed me to make substitutions without additional cost and had it ready for us in 30 minutes.  Plus, there was lots of variety on the platter and the food was delicious.  What could I possibly complain about?    Yes, there is an elegant, higher-end sushi restaurant on Baldwin nearby, but that's a whole two blocks away!  Who can be bothered to go that far?  And they take a long time.  And they don't have yam rolls."}
{"text":"What can I say? Don't go to Top Sushi.   I've never been a fan of small, casual sushi restaurants around the block because I'd rather not eat sushi that's made sloppily. There's a standard to sushi, and that's fresh raw fish without a brick of rice under it.  Alas, I succumbed to ordering takeout from Top Sushi because I was nearby and I wanted sushi. I regret it. I ordered the Salmon Sushi Set for takeout and to be fair, the sushi was decent. It didn't look horrendous and tasted alright.   Howeverrrrrrrr, when I got home that night, I suffered a bad case of food poisoning. And now I remember why I pay more for good sushi.  Lesson of the day kids; pay more for good sushi."}
{"text":"No... not top sushi. You get what you pay for. I had the calamari, which was cooked to ruin, and the unagi roll, which was slathered in bbq sauce. The server was rude and inattentive and kept shouting to the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go for good sushi for sure!!! Only came out of convenience. It was close to work.   Ordered the sashimi lunch set. It was pretty fast I didn't wait long. It had 12 pieces including the fake crab and surf clam. It's not really big. I was not full from it. It comes with soup rice and salad. Soup and salad was okay pretty standard. The salad was sooooaked in the dressing and the iceberg lettuce was not fresh at all it was pretty gross. The sashimi didn't taste particularly fresh or not.   Overall service was meh, the lady wasn't particularly friendly. The food okay. Salad gross. I think I may have to walk a bit further to get decent sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not feeling this place.  I've been here a few times now.  I go mostly because it's right beside U of T where I study.  I think the fact that it's so close to campus means the resto can deliver a sub-par dining experience and still know broke students who want a cheap meal will return.  I think the last time I went will be my last.  Everything just tastes bland and cheap, from the tasteless tea and miso soup to the rolls that are mostly rice.  If you're willing to walk 5 minutes further, you're far better going to a place in the annex like Big Sushi (a personal fav)."}
{"text":"stopped here after a sudden urge for sushi.  we were a group of 3 on a sunday night. the place was basically empty.  it's hard to expect a superior quality food from a student location restaurant. but the prices very pretty cheap (+ additional 10% discount if paid by cash)  what delighted me - they have a very decent selection of vegetarian dishes. I think they had 8 or more variants of veg makis and rolls. also not only veg bento boxes but also veg rolls sets with veg sushis and all these come in combos for under $10! so I say this place wins in my books for veg selection. portions are also huge  the service was nothing to write home about but not rude or impolite.  the experience was a bit shattered after one of us went to a washroom and quickly returned with a disgusted face. one of the stalls was so dirty (someone obviously felt very sick there...) that it was impossible to get in.  we were worried that we will get sick... but seems like food was clean."}
{"text":"I would only come here for convenience and the price. Before going in, I didn't expect much based on the lunch prices and appearance. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki special and I ordered the dynamite roll.  Both were $6.99 i believe. However, they gave her the beef teriyaki instead. Since the beef was kind of covered by the lettuce and beansprouts and she was eating the \"appetizers\" in the bento box beforehand, she assumed it was chicken. Also, we weren't sure whether it was just extremely marinated chicken or something.  When we told the waiter that it was the wrong dish, the manager (I think) came over and instead gave us a lecture on how we had to let him know right away because then he can't give it to another customer. Is he really going to give a cold bento box and soggy tempura to another customer? Gross. Luckily, my friend didn't want to cause a large scene and just said it's fine and she'll eat it. Fortunately, they manager repeatedly apologized every time he came to our table. I guess it was the lunch rush.  My maki rolls were okay.  Don't have high expectations when you come here and come only if you're really really craving sushi in the area."}
{"text":"The only reason why I go to this place is because in between classes I have limited time for lunch. They are usually packed during lunch hour but this is probably because of the same reason I go ( no time) . I absolutely hate their service, they(the waitress) are really rude, balance that with the chef being nice. But anyway, their sushi is avg half the time and the other half of the time you end up with really nasty soggy rice. Yuck. But despite the soggy rice I don't say anything :( because I'm afraid when I go back next time they will poison me!"}
{"text":"This 2 star review is me not being too harsh with Top Sushi, I understand it caters to university students who just want very cheap sushi, and it does that sort of well? Yes it's cheaper than some of the other sushi places close by (and by that I mean the one's on Baldwin Village) but it's still not dirt cheap, their lunch specials are $6.99 and while they do have close to 20 or so options to choose from, none really seemed that great and 4 out of the 6 in our group chose to order from their regular menu instead.   Things it has going well for it: Great Location The staff are friendlier than average They have an upstairs section which is a lot roomier than the first floor. 10% off if you pay cash which is a big plus.   Some negatives Service was fluctuated from very quick to very slow for our dishes Not great food, my friend suggested the chicken teriyaki and I was not overly impressed my the sauce heavy dish that came my way.  The rice % I didn't find to be too high, but it was just your normal cheap sushi.   I would not visit Top Sushi again if I can help it as for $1 - $3 more I can get superior food just a short walk away in one of the many Baldwin sushi locations close by. But with some friends that work on campus and have only short lunch hours I'm afraid I've not seen the last of it."}
{"text":"Service is always extremely slow, and the food is mediocre at best. It's fantastically overpriced outside of their lunch hours and even then, it's doubtful."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is depressing.  Staff look like they're being held hostage and sweating profusely. Don't speak English.  Interior looks like someone was creating a movie scene and asked, \"Can you mix a truck stop restaurant with a Toronto sushi join?\"  Avocados were harder than my dick.   Sushi was poor quality.  Music was a 50/50 mix of obnoxious top 40 and radio advertisements.  Businesses like this should not be in business, but somehow they are. Probably due to a good location: near U of T."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for a second lunch lol. Really close to UofT - super convenient location for hungry and poor students! Had their $7.99 lunch special chicken teriyaki bento box. Meal came with miso soup, which had more oil spots than what I'm used to, 3 sad little salmon sushi, a good amount of white rice, chicken+onion teriyaki, and vegetable tempura. Couldn't really tell from the outside, but actually quite a large space inside for seating. Gets pretty loud since groups do tend to come here. You can save 10% if you pay with cash and have to pay a fee to use credit. Free wifi :)  Portion size - 5/5, I was full Taste - 3/5, nothing amazing, but not atrocious either Food presentation - 2/5, def not trying to impress with their lunch bentos Space - 3/5, big enough for groups Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch on a Wednesday when they opened at 11. I picked two specials off the lunch menu because they seemed to be very small. The sashimi combo had only 3 pieces of salmon sashimi and 3 pieces each of tai, crab and surf clam. The quality was okay. The bento  box I got was beef short rib with tempura and salmon maki roll. There were only 3 pieces of short rib, they really skimped on it. One of the pieces of sweet potato tempura was undercooked and hard. I asked for tea and the lady (who wasn't very pleasant) said it was still being made. I had to ask another guy later for the tea. The meal came to about $18 after the 10% discount for paying with cash. It was quite expensive for the little amount of food I got and the low quality of it. I wasn't near being full at all. Definitely a lower quality sushi restaurant but it's right next to the campus and close to my classes. I don't think I'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice, tried tge chiraso the first time and it was okay..very small cuts and of poor quality, prices are only a buck less than a regular restaurant.  Radio is too loud for the size of the place.  Second visit, same issue cant hear anything over the top 40 station blasting (ke$ha isn't really early afternoon brunch music) the Worst was the red dragon roll-soo skimpy and too much rice, the salmon is actually cut into small squares the size of a thimble lol. Thats not good, I understand cost controls on foods but this is just driving away customers :s"}
{"text":"Came for dinner recently and the quality has gone up a tad bit. A very small bit, it was around $11 after tax/tip for a dinner bento box with 6 pieces of sushi (salmon and cucumber), chicken terriyaki, a miso soup and salad, orange slices, rice, tempura vegetables and gyoza. A really good deal for the price, but their food was definitely on the salty side, and still very slow service. We went from 4 to 5pm, so there was at most 1-2 other tables there, and yet their service was still so slow, so if you're in a hurry, you might not want to come here!  Fun fact, there's a discount if you pay in cash!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go here. Prices were not cheap but not horrible either... I went with the \"short rib\" bento box ($10.95). The bento was overpowered mostly by cheap tempura vegetables & I found everything to be pretty average until trying the meat. It was rubbery, inedible, and to be honest vomit-inducing (I had my friend try it as well). Because the server did not come over to check on anyone during the meal--despite us being the only ones there--I eventually walked up to the front counter and informed the server that I would like to replace my short rib portion for chicken, or anything else.  She refused, saying that I had taken too long to inform her of the problem, although I hadn't had the opportunity given she stayed behind her counter during the entire meal. After talking to management, she told me that short ribs need to be eaten \"immediately\" and that was why they probably were unappetizing. I get annoyed with BS-excuses, especially when it's obvious that I'm not trying to con anyone--I left the majority of short rib uneaten on the plate.   So...to summarize: I paid $11 for a crappy meal featuring inedible meat. As long as I don't get sick I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"Always fresh. Soup, salad, and tea are complimentary. 10%off if you're paying cash. As a UofT student, i come often and i'm always pleased with the service and food."}
{"text":"Horrible overpriced sushi. Avoid at all cost if you can. If you cant avoid it, at least dont order the bubble tea"}
{"text":"Went to Top Sushi with a friend on a Friday (early evening, around 6:00PM).  Not that many people there, but we were accommodated fairly quickly.  The menu is fairly diverse and can be found on their website easily (http://www.topsushionline.com/2652.html).  We ordered the following: - Pizza Salmon Sushi - Matsu Combo 1 (1 pcs Each Of Tuna, Salmon, Hokkigai, Tai, Kani; 8 pcs Of California & Salmon Skin Handroll) - Sashimi Combo A (3 pcs Each Of Tuna, Salmon, Tai, Hokkigai)  The atmosphere is a bit cramped, but what can you do?  It's situated in a small house that used to be a photocopying centre, so it's not that bad.  I had asked my friends about whether Top Sushi was any good, but got mixed reviews about it.  I would say that it's good for its price.  The salmon sashimi was actually very good - a bit fatty, but it \"falls apart in your mouth\" (as food critics say).  I found the miso soup a bit too salty for my taste and the tea that they had seemed a bit sketchy (was really yellow in the cups), but overall, the food is good for the price.  In terms of service, the thing that annoyed me was that one of the waitresses came by several times to ask us if we were ready to order.  We spent a good amount of time flipping through the menu because there were so many options, so having the waitress stop by every 4 minutes did bother me, but she was just doing her job.  Apart from that, the 10% discount if you pay in cash is very appealing.  Especially since I'm a university student who's looking to save some money on food every now and then."}
{"text":"I went to high school next door here and would have the lunch special once a week. it's the most worthwhile thing on the menu - a seriously large portion of food for $6.99 and even more if you upgrade to the 8.99 ones (iirc). The teriyaki chicken was my favorite."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter of the prices or qualities. The mere fact I got sick from eating it should prevent me going there any more. Anyone else?"}
{"text":"More like BOTTOM Sushi.  The only good thing about this place is their tempura, but that isn't enough to make me come back.   1. The water tasted dusty.  2. The salad is gross. What is that, mayonnaise? 3. The sushi rice was hard and dry.  4. The chicken teriyaki was too sweet, in a sickening way. 5. Their fried tofu dish had huge fish flakes on it, which I have never seen in any agedashi tofu dish. Very unappetizing.   I can't give it a zero, since 1 is the lowest I am able to do.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The only reason Top Sushi really prospers is for the same reason many of the eating places around College and St. George prosper: students on a schedule and on a budget.  I admit I fully contribute to this and have been here several times. Just like other restaurants in the area, this isn't the kind of place you go to for a nice dinner with friends. Their food is standard mediocre Toronto sushi restaurant quality -- they've got your basic sushi and most of it is ... all right. Their soup udon dishes are comparable to what I make at home, except the udon noodles aren't chewy enough.  Service is similarly bland. I don't have high expectations of these kinds of sushi restaurants in the first place, but it always irks me when paying by debit or credit card REQUIRES you to go up to the front and pay. Especially around the lunch hour when there are a lot of students ordering take-out, it crowds the cash register area.  Good for an hour's lunch break for a busy student, not for much else."}
{"text":"This place is very convenient for UofT students especially when you're in a rush; however, I do advise to go elsewhere if you're looking for a nice sit down sushi restaurant. The lunch specials are $7.99 (as mentioned) and includes a miso soup. The specials use to have a salad that comes with it, but I guess not anymore? The rolls are OK, a bit tasteless and the tempura shrimp has a weird texture to it. The avocados are fresh and the service is quick for a take-out order."}
{"text":"I really really wish Top Sushi was just a better sushi place. There are so many gems in the city (or at least in the \"decent\" category) that I don't know why I continue to suffer with this place (mainly, because \"location, location, location\").   This is definitely the closest sushi place to the library area / my work at UofT - meaning it is PACKED with students on the lunch hour. They have $6.99 lunch specials - I always have trouble choosing, not because everything looks good, but because... nothing really does.   Their lunch specials all have a cucumber roll or a ton of California rolls in them, which really just aren't that appealing. They have no sashimi specials, and only one with sushi - it has only 7 pieces, and you don't even get a California roll to fill you! I have recently learned that you can make some substitutions for $2.50, which improves the selection slightly.    The service here is only okay - I find myself asking for water a few times, and when it's especially busy I've had experiences where some of the group has to wait 20 minutes for their food.   Really, I feel pretty confident that I'm done coming here - it may be the most convenient, but with Chinatown just down the street - I might as well pay and have better sushi delivered (or earn myself a longer lunch break!)"}
{"text":"Cheap and awful just like all the other joints on this street. Not much to say about it."}
{"text":"I love their salmon teriyaki, but they have the worst rice I've ever tasted. Dry with a weird, unpleasant taste. The fish is far from fresh, so don't order their sushi, sashimi, or poke.   But yea, with all that, this restaurant can still survive because UofT students can get a decent meal (which is almost impossible when you're on campus) for $10.  Oh yea, there is 10% discount if you pay cash for to-go, but you will be automatically charged for plastic bag (5 cents+tax). They are not upfront about this extra charge, so I feel uncomfortable having to pay it every time."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place and within 5 hours I had the worst bout of food poisoning I've had in my life.  3 days of stomach pain, diarrhea, sweats (both hot and cold), general malaise, body aches, and tiredness.  1- Phone ordering was easy, especially since we called 15 minutes before closing; 2- Customer service was ok, we paid and waited for them to get the order finished when we arrived.  They chatted amongst themselves but handed the food over with a smile; 3- Portion size was good; 4- The food seemed ok while I was eating it.  Not overly impressed with the taste but not the worst sushi I've tasted.  Sadly this experience has put a long-term halt to my sushi intake...and I've loved sushi for years.  The thought of reliving the pain just isn't worth it to me no matter the place serving the sushi.  They've scarred me that much.  The silver lining, my wife ate exactly the same thing and didn't get sick.  I'm glad she didn't have to live through what I did.  Interesting to note it was her 2nd time eating there.  For me, my last time."}
