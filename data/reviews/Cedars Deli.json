{"text":"I used to come here very often for the large jumbo shawarma and the good tasting meat. It's seems as though the quality of the meat flavor has gone down and is now very plain. I do not think the Jumbo size is now worth it because it tends to be just as big as the large..."}
{"text":"Nice and clean and everything in between.  The staff are quick and friendly and they get the job done to your liking.  I've never felt rushed even when I struggle with my toppings.  All their ingredients tasted fresh and the falafels (it's all I order) are really good!  The seasoning is nice and there's a good balance between the crunchy outside texture and the soft meatiness.  Since I'm building the wrap myself all the time, it's my fault that it doesn't taste good.  But I've never had that problem so far because I'm that good. Lol.  It's one of my favourite places around the corner."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 15 stars, I would. I had previously fallen in delicious tasty love with the Edmonton Trail location, so when I saw that Cedars opened in Panorama near where I live, I was ecstatic.  Every dish is excellent. The donairs are hot and flavorful and not greasy. I load mine up with all of the fixings and it is so tasty. I love biting into the different crunchy veggies and getting the different tastes and textures. I also regularly order chicken shawarma and falafel and I have never been anything but completely satisfied and impressed. We eat here at least once a week as it's so close to home, convenient, and not super heavy.  Not to mention, the staff is super friendly and a few of them even remember our orders. 15 stars!"}
{"text":"I am die hard fan of Cedar's in Panorama Hills, in my area. We eat there more than once a week, and every dish is excellent. So, because of this I did not hesitate to try Cedar's in Market Mall. The chicken shawarma wrap was greasy and hardly warm, and bland.  It was an utter disappointment. If you want the best shawarma and donairs in town - check out either the original Edmonton trail location, or the Panatella spot. There you can order anything on the menu and it will be piping hot, fresh and flavorful. Skip the mall food court rendition!"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at this place.   I had been to the cedars on edmonton trail multiple times and this one is just as awesome.  Reasonably priced, hot, fresh and delicious.   5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my quick donair fix place. When i need a donair quick i head here to the mall.  The food is always good.  The donair size is ok.  I never leave hungry anyway.   They do tons of other stuff but my thing is donairs.  The    I think the price is a little high for the size of donair.  I'd like to see a little larger donair for the price they charge.  But when you need a quick fix you pay what they charge.  I also think its because their in the mall and the rent is so high they need to charge a bit more."}
{"text":"this place is incredible. i m from montreal and spoiled with incredible Mediterranean foods but this is the place for me to get my fix!.. i had the chicken shawarma plate with the almond and date couscous, hummus, lentil salad and rice with a pita. needless to say all this food was enough for 3 meals (i m a small eater but still....) . the price was decent and their food is fresh. the fatayer is awesomeee. i have eaten at Aidas, Chickpea and even Babylon Qithara and this place rocks (even better!) for the price....check it out  ur tummy and wallet will be delighted."}
{"text":"I often get lunch here and I must say Calgary needs more places like cedars! They are always so kind and polite and make an effort to remember what I like. Also they load you up on veggies unlike Subway where two pickles seems to be their maximum quota. All in all food is excellent and customer service is the best you can get. I will always continue to support their buisness."}
{"text":"Just not what I expected. Got the donair,  service was very fast ,almost like they were in a rush. I was the only one in line at the time. The food was bland almost generic. Not the Cedars I remember."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise this place was. Exceptional customer service and really tasty options. Try the chicken shawarma & garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Cheap when it comes to chicken. Choose the beef choice instead.  Choose the sandwiches rather than the plates. The food quality is good."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food. This place is always busy especially at lunch time, and for good reason. I love the interesting options for your sandwich. I love the pickled turnip...who knew it would taste so good. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to have a Falafel or Chicken Shawarma.  I am always hesitant to order food that the kids haven't tried before....but they seemed to like it.  It's not my favorite Falafel but it's pretty good and fast service. The staff were super great and really patient with the kids trying to order for the first time. They recommended things on the menu they would probably eat and they were for the most part right.  Nice small eatery, fast and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Everything in my chicken plate was VERY SALTY. And all the vegetables were VERY DRY (not even exaggerating - they no longer have juice and should be tossed to the garbage). Will never come back and not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken shawarmas!  I like the fact that they have two different hot sauces to choose from.  There is a good portion of chicken in the shawarma and a wide selection of veggies.  I find that adding mozzarella cheese gives it a rich and creamy taste, a must have!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, some of the best donairs and shawarmas in town. There are others that are great but this is my \"go to\" place. The veggies are always fresh, the meats cooked to perfection and the sides are awesome. Great spinach philos and samosas too. The service is top notch. Literally have not had a bad experience here, ever."}
{"text":"For fast food,  cedars can't be beat.   The staff at this location are delightful and engaging with the customers.   The food itself is fantastic and reasonably priced.    When I need to grab a bite on the go I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My dinner at Cedars was great.  It is definitely a much needed new option at Market Mall.  I enjoy all the different options.  I had a mini mezza platter which was anything but mini!  My only real disappointment was that the three falafel balls were not warm at all.  I realize that most places pre-fry them but most at least microwave them before they plop them on your plate.    I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Best around. The baclava is spectacular. The mix donair with beef and chicken rocks. Can't go wrong at good old Cedars."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime fan of Cedars. Been going to them for many years so was very happy to know market mall had a location. The food and service is top notch. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I used to eat here religiously. Workers are well trained, fast as could be and really friendly. They are constantly cleaning which is good. Owner jumps in to help often. My only recommendation is to get there early in the day otherwise you are stuck with the meat from the end of the day which can be a bit dry which I learned. The baklava is really delicious here."}
{"text":"I enjoy the jumbo beef donair. My roommate loves the chicken donair. I don't understand why the charge more for the mixed meat donair when both beef and chicken individually are the same price.  The place is clean, the service staff very friendly. The donairs though not huge ( I like huge) are tastey and very clean.  You can eat a donair from there and not have a giant mess on your table.  The meat portions are the only thing not giving a 5 star in my opinion.  Definitely worth a visit if you want a donair in this area because the next closest place is ten mins away or more."}
{"text":"Love the food here and guys are always friendly :) great alternative to other fast food restaurants in the mall"}
{"text":"This is my go too place for a Donair. Lots of meet and a good flavour. I'm not an expert by any means but I always enjoy the meal here. Most places in malls give a wrap with teziki sauce but. I like that. I can get a Donair with sweet sauce here. The. People are always friendly and the quality of the food is always good. I eat there a couple times a week and never get a bad meal. If you want an alternative to the chain opa this is a good bet. Way more meat in my Donair here."}
{"text":"When ever I have a craving for good shawarma (which is frequent) I have tunnel vision heading straight to Cedars Deli. I always order the chicken shawarma and they never fail to satisfy. Not only the food is delicious but the service is incredible! The staff are super friendly and very welcoming as soon as you step through the door. The place is comfortable and always clean and same with the washroom.  I always have a pleasant experience when ordering and dinning. Highly recommend this place for shawarma lovers."}
{"text":"Man.. I love Cedars. I was at Market Mall trying to be a mall rat and was staaaaarving. I'm trying to eat \"healthy\" and there's really not many options there... Subway? *yawn\"  I swear.. this place has it's own glow, it's found in the corner of the Food Court.. just a few steps over from Marble Slab (don't ask what I was doing there).   They get the food right! The quality of food is great! It's always a very filling meal without the guilt. My favourite is a Chicken shawrma or the plate if I'm super hungry... fine and the hummus and pita to go (for a snack while I study)    The eats at the UofC campus are really limited, driving to the Mall, resisting temptation to buy anything, and trekking all the way to the food court is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Tried it for the first time yesterday. Amazed to find such a great place with such good quality in a mall food court. I had the beef shwarma wrap with garlic and sweet and tzatziki sauce, my husband had the falafel wrap, we shared a veggie samosa and small tabbouleh salad and wrapped up the meal with baklava. Everything was perfect. Nothing was too greasy or too dry, the spices were balanced and flavorful and the baklava was juicy, sweet (but not too much) with a fresh pistachio flavor. Definitely 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"For a food court, Cedars Deli is A-OK in my books. Price is very reasonable ($8.00) for a regular size chicken wrap. Lots of selection for toppings and the portion is very large. My only qualm is that the food isn't as flavourful as the Panorama Hills location. However, if your choices are greasy fried Asian food, greasy fried chicken, greasy fries and gravy, and Subway, I'd pick Cedars.  Kudos to the employee, who responded to my squeal of horror at his very generous squirt of garlic mayo sauce, \"What? It's good stuff! It tastes great.\" Also, he wrote \"His\" and \"Hers\" on our wraps, so we would know which one was which. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Everything In The Menu Is Halal. I've Had Their Wraps Before But Decided To Try Their Plate Special That Comes With Salad, Pita Bread, Rice, Sauce And Chicken Shwarma. Pretty Good. It's Not The Most Flavourful Shwarma I've Had But Its Decent."}
{"text":"I remember eating at Cedars on Stephen Avenue and later on tenth while growing up. Since then I've discovered I need to eat gluten-free. I hesitate to go back to old favorites because I worry about being disappointed by what I can't have or by a lack of knowledge about ingredients.  With Cedars I was very impressed. The man who took my order knew right away what I could and could not have. I was able to have a chicken shwarma platter with potatoes instead of rice and without pitas. Pitas obviously contain gluten, but Cedars' rice has small noodles in it as well which is important to be aware of.  All the optional extra vegetables were ok, so I had garlic sauce, hummus, pickled turnip, dill pickles and onions. Everything was delicious, much like I remember it from years passed. The chicken schwarma plate was a generous portion of fresh food for $9. A bottle of juice put it around $11 total.  If you're ever eating at the Market Mall food court Cedars is a good choice. And if you need to eat gluten-free I think it's the best choice there."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Way to go guys! Now open one in the south :D"}
{"text":"It's all about the condiments!  The pickled beet and cucumbers are crave-inducing.  The portions are liberal and can make for a substantial lunch the next day.  They have a mind-blowing array of baklava that can be just the thing to bring to a pot-luck or as a hostess gift.  The falafels don't knock my socks off.  The ones from Costco (in the ready-foods aisle to heat at home) are more tasty believe it or not.  But, the sauces are zippy, garlicky and full of yum.  I found the previous owners more friendly ('hands on') but the service has never lacked in quality!  The prices are a little higher than other joints but this place comes close in taste to the first shawarma that ever captured my heart...so my taste buds call Cedar's Deli by name."}
{"text":"Found this one dirty and the staff rude and abrupt. It's to bad as Cedars was one of the originals in this type of food in Calgary. Food was decent but my opinion was so poor with my interaction with the staff it's hard to put that aside to comment on the food. Unfortunately it appears franchising has hurt the quality and service they were known for."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and equally amazing service. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The quality and portions you get are awesome, especially for being in a mall. The staff is friendly and super accommodating. I find myself going to the mall just to eat there. If you are in Calgary this is definitely a place you need to stop."}
{"text":"Great food!!! So fresh... Best falafel ever! I absolutely love the stuffed vine leaves...  Very healthy and vegetarian options !"}
{"text":"I Loooooove the kibbi balls. And beef fatayre. Those are the items I always buy, and usually some baklava too.   But the last few months the portions has shrunken considerably. The kibbi balls used to be huge, now they're about the size of a small walnut. Charging a $1.25 for one seems outrageous.   I used to frequent this location as I work in the mall, but now i think I'll be going else where to get more value for my dollar. Sorry cedars, because I really love you."}
{"text":"Very tasty and healthy. Easily the best meal in market mall. I got the chicken shawarma, next time I go I'm going to get the platter as the person in front of me got that and it looked awesome."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cedars Deli many years and have never been disappointed except the one time they ran out of eggplant dip when I so desperately wanted some!  So, cornerstone plate is my fave with chicken n falafels. I love their bean salad and all their ingredients are fresh n crisp. No sad, soggy tomatoes or wilted lettuce. I love their hummus as its not overpowered by garlic and the consistency is less grainier than most store bought varieties. The pita is always warm and you can choose white or whole wheat.  I'm not a big beef shawarma person and always get chicken. I love the grape leaves with their tart lemony rice and chewy leaves. Tahini with falafels is tasty and service is friendly at this location. For fast food, this is age eat place for good eats. Their sandwiches also have 3 different sizes to suit your appetite.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love Cedars, and even more so now that I can get my fix even if the Edmonton Trail location is closed- this one has mall hours! While I hate entertaining the idea of a mall food court, I found it very efficient today on my way home to stop by Market Mall, spend five minutes inside getting my vegan Mediterranean plate to go, and then running away again.  This plate included three falafel balls, tahini, tabouleh, four vine leaves, hummus, and pita. All of this cost $9 which is fantastic to me. So much food. Another thing that I like getting is the mini mezza for $7.50, but I wanted grapevine leaves so this worked perfectly. Despite being busy, the service is friendly and efficient. The staff are great, and the menu even has little symbols for \"vegetarian\" \"vegan\" and \"dairy free\" which is the coolest. I am never nervous about my food choices when I eat at Cedars.  With the gross mall environment, I was even able to pack this up, take it home, and eat on a normal person plate without listening to the conversations of teenage girls or screaming children.  Keep being awesome, guys.  Review 34/30 of Yelp's 30 day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Gosh!  I miss my Cedars.  I used to eat at Cedars at 3 of the locations - at the U of C and there were 2 locations in downtown.  I'm so happy that Cedars has finally opened a deli in the NW and in Market Mall.  They just opened a week ago.    The food is just as good as I remembered.  I had the Falafel Wrap for only $5.50!!  The pitas come in either wholewheat or white.  You get to choose the sauce you want - of course, tahini for the falafel wrap - and choose the vegetables that you want.  I look at the vegetable bar and see that all vegetables are fresh and green and some are pickled.  I also asked to add banana peppers to my wrap to add a hint of spice!    There are also the different plates - chicken, beef, mini mezza - comes with the veges and the wrap.  There's also the vineleaf rolls, fatayers, different salads like the tabouli and chick pea salad.  I'll have to go back and have the Chicken wrap or they used to call it \"Shishtawouk Sandwich.\"    Cedars Deli accepts cash and credit cards."}
{"text":"Heard good things from friends and I was in the neighborhood so I had to stop.  Ordered the beef donair with all their veggies along with their garlic and sweet sauce.  Also ordered a small container of their tabouli salad.  Meat is well seasoned and paired with fresh veggies that includes what what I think is pickled radishes...combined with garlic and sweet sauce....delicious! Tabouli salad is fresh and dressing pairs really well with it. Will go back to try their chicken."}
{"text":"Gave the place a try today as it's close to me but it was lacking flavor not at all that good, for the same price and better tasting food with more to offer for sides and toppings and fresh meat I would rather drive the extra minutes to jerusalem shawarma. The meat cedars sits in a container in their salad bar after it's cooked for who knows how long I would much rather see my meat being cooked while I'm there.."}
{"text":"Ok, I had to try this place, being in such close proximity to my home, there was no excuse not to.  The deli is super clean, modern, plenty of seating and the staff are all super nice.  However, having a vast knowledge in Lebanese and Greek cuisine I have to say, this place missed the mark completely on taste.  Everything looked wonderfully appetizing so me and hubby opted for the cornerstone plate and a large chicken shawarma wrap.  We went in after lunch, at about two so it was dead.  The good: everything was fresh, clean and you can sub, or add to your order SOME items. The rice was done perfectly.  The bad: chicken was mostly burned, tough and lacked flavour.  Tabouli was not done right, missing fundamental ingredients such as a good olive oil, mint, onions, more tomatoes and tang, either lemon or pomegranate syrup was missing.  The entire cornerstone platter was a big pile of food in a huge mound.  When I mentioned that I wanted the food separate the lady said \"this is how we do it, next time let me know ahead of time!\"  Well with all do respect, thats not how its done! The Chick Pea, Pita Basket, and Desert Pita all separate the food so you can enjoy them individually.  The hummus was also lacking lemon and salt, and mixed in with tabouli was not very palatable.  The tatziki was not a traditional Lebanese or Greek tatziki either, severely lacking cucumbers, garlic, and mint. I passed completely on any of their bean type offerings because I am not a fan and they just looked blah...I asked for dolmades instead and the lady at the counter said they cannot sub a salad for dolmades- whatever, I asked for Greek salad instead of the beans, with my tabouli, tatziki, hummus and chicken I also got a bit of rice since I passed on the bean offerings.  The Greek salad was underwhelming too, my Greek bestie would have had a heyday with them!    They also give you a falafel ball with your meal but it too was wa-waaaaa, hard, lukewarm and the filling was too coarse for my liking, again not seasoned well at all.  Will I try this place again? Maybe, but I might go during a lunch rush so I can by-pass the burnt chicken.  Also, a traditional fattoush offering would be much better than the bean selections, I found their salad offering typical of North American fare.  I give them a pass, 2.5 for now- as Cedars offers much better options than what is in the area (ie, pho joints and Pizza in every plaza), but still no where near as good as I've had.  What a shame, I was really hoping this would have been the place to get my Lebanese fix. Hopefully the kinks get straightened out as they still are fairly new, and I'll become a regular.    A Lebanese mamma or a \"tata\" prepping the food would probably solve the problems I mentioned above, the mom palette just knows, no offence to the staff that were there that day."}
