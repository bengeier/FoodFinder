{"text":"Delicious and moist chicken. 
Potato wedges tasted like their chicken! The next time I come I will be sure to try their seafood menu.

Be sure to call ahead of time if you are in a rush. A lot of their food is made fresh to order.

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I came here as opposed to the big franchises! We ordered 2 spicy chicken combos, and they were great. Tasted like a home made sandwich and healthy! 

Owner was very nice and friendly as well! Will come again"}
{"text":"Great alternative to the chain fried chicken places. I had the lunch special of 3-piece chicken with a drink. The meat was juicy, and the special sauce was the great mix of sour and tangy. Best of all, the owner was friendly and very accommodating. Recommended if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The service was very friendly and helpful. I will be coming back to try their fish."}
{"text":"Not from the area and found this place on Yelp for a quick dinner.  The food is great, clean tasting fried chicken.  We ordered the fried chicken and a chicken sandwich.  My 3 year old ate 3 pieces of chicken, way more than he eats at home.  Everything was crispy and tasty.  Popeyes is in the same plaza and this place is exponentially better.

The owner is also super nice, he offered to put on cartoons for my son :-)

Definitely stop by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service is perfect .
The price is lower then KFC and Popeyes .
Chicken was a good size and fresh .
My wife loved it .
But I would rather have Popeyes .
It's just me .
This place is worth trying"}
{"text":"I went to check out this location as its been open for 4 months now. I went to try their burger combo, the owner was very friendly and and engaging. This is his forth location, he has 3 locations in Winnipeg. 

The combo was made fresh and hot. The Burger came with usual fries and a pop. The burger was fresh, crispy and enjoyable plus the fries was good too. 

Overall, a good option for a quick grab and go bite. 

For Muslim bro and Sis - They serve halal meat and the flyer I received at home stated they having zabihah by hand."}
{"text":"Delicious Fried chicken. The crispy skin was flavourful and the meat itself tender and juicy. Freshly made and quick to serve. Would recommend for a fast and tasty meal."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and ordered a spicy chicken burger and had some chicken pieces. Chicken had great flavour and was not greasy like other fried chicken places. Service was great and I would return."}
{"text":"The best item on the menu is the chicken wrap, flavourful, and spicy. 

The rest of the chicken could use some work, it was a bit bland. However, service was fast, the location was clean and airy, and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Try it once and it'll become your new favorite! We ordered a family meal for takeout and the first thing we noticed was that it smells amazing. The chicken is very crispy and flavorful. Each piece were consistently high quality unlike certain big name franchises. Owner and workers are super friendly as well, which is always a huge plus!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken sandwich combo, the chicken sandwich is pretty good however the fries were pretty bad. I really wanted to try their potato wedges but there wasn't any. I also tried a 2 piece chicken which was too greasy for my liking. If you're a fried chicken lover you'll love it but if you're a healthy eater like me you'll only eat here on cheat days"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Very tender, juicy and freshly cooked fried chicken. It was excellent with their home hot sauce and their coleslaw was great as well. Definitely recommend them to anyone. The service was excellent as well, the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to Roosters Edge regularly since they've opened, and I believe their fried chicken is some of the best in Mississauga. It's lighter than Popeyes or Quick Chick, and you can't beat their opening special offer. The spicy chicken sandwich is also excellent. They also offer some fish and chip dishes, but I wasn't overly impressed with the quantity of fish for the price."}
{"text":"Just checked out this place today. The owner is amazingly friendly, honest, and generous. Me and my wife had the 3 pc fried chicken as well as the chicken sandwich with side of wedges. All were fresh and tasted amazing. Thumbs up to this new discovery in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The lady behind the counter was very nice and provided great service. The chicken was tasty as well. Their grand opening special deal is probably the best in town right now for fried chicken @ 4 pieces for $5. 

The only gripe I have is the presentation, which was on a paper plate. Drop by and check it out."}
{"text":"Went there with the family this weekend. Tried their fried chicken pieces and spicy fried chicken sandwich. Both were on point. If you are a fried chicken fan this place is a must visit. 

To top it off the owner is very helpful and went out his way with respect to service."}
{"text":"This is the much needed alternative to Popeyes and KFC.  Chicken is to die for. The flavoring is their own unique one, and I can say that it's darn delicious. Food came out quickly. Best of all, the owner was a really decent and nice person.

Goodbye Popeyes from now on ."}
{"text":"I was in the area attending a car meet at the plaza over when I started to feel a little peckish. Having heard about this place from Yelp and a few other friends I thought I would give this place a check. 

I have to say, out of all the fried chicken places I have ever been to, this place has to be THE BEST! The quality of the chicken, and just the food in general was quite phenomenal. Sure it is a little expensive, but it was worth every penny and wouldn't hesitate to go back again. 

Good food only gets better with good service, and this is where the place really shines! I was served by the owner and he is a phenomenal operator. He is very engaging and hospitable. He was willing to answer any questions I had with a smile everytime. It isn't everyday you see an owner with such a passion for what he does. It may sound like a stretch but I would recommend someone to go just to experience his \"style\". 

Definitely a go to in my books."}
{"text":"Good chicken. Not oily. Halal. The bearded gentleman who served was very nice too."}
{"text":"You may be thinking - \"I want a Wendy's chicken burger!\"  You would be wrong. What you want is a Rooster's Edge chicken burger. Trust me. It is the chicken burger by which all other chicken burgers should be judged. It is the archetype of the chicken burger. It is the chicken burger origin story. Also lovely service."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly. He was very welcoming and added to the overall experience. Food was exceptional!  We had the spicy chicken burger and chicken pieces. We loved everything. Definitely coming here again"}
{"text":"I have had chicken strips, chicken, beef and fish burger. The beef burger is THE BEST! Mainly becoz it is grilled rather than fried. I also like all the salads. 

Everyone should try this place out. Its halal, not too expensive. Has friendly employees and the food tastes great. And, if you happen to be a cricket lover, you can watch that live too. Great place for small parties. Clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Such good customer service, and the chicken is comparable to popeyes or kfc without being over priced. No longer are the days waiting for Tuesdays just to be able to afford chicken. They got a dealz for dayz"}
{"text":"Yum! Ordered the spicy chicken burger, it's delicious. It's better than your big chain fast-food. Eating it now and I'm really enjoying the flavours ! An optimal amount of spicy for my tastebuds. Plus the service was super nice. Hoping to return with friends !"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the chicken here. It looks great but I didn't enjoy the taste of the seasonings. It was juicy but that's only because the chicken is extremely fatty. Fatty to the point of disgusting. Chicken fat just grosses me out. When ripping the chicken apart to eat there were globs of chicken fat under the skin and on the chicken itself. It was stuck under my nails and left my hands disgustingly greasy. I couldn't eat it anymore. I had to eat a couple of oranges to get rid of the taste. The other big turn off for me was the chicken feathers still on some of the pieces. 

Globs of chicken fat and chicken feathers are not my idea of a good chicken dinner. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken burgers ever!! So gooooooood...The chicken is not too greasy and has the perfect amount of crunch and spiciness. The staff is super friendly too. I am definitely going to be dropping by every time I am in the area. I believe it just opened since I have not come across it before. Highly recommend."}
