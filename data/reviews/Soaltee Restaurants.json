{"text":"Been there with my kids. Food is below average quality with lots of oil! and naan bread was dry and hard. It's not value for money place, and we decided never to go there again."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tikka masala and the shahi paneer. Both dishes were very good but one of the dishes has some sort of stringy plastic in it. The plain naan was a little dry and burnt but still tasted good. The garlic naan was perfect. The water jug tasted like warm melted ice. The owner was nice enough to not charge us for the one dish. The staff and owner were all very nice. I would come back if in the area but wouldn't go out of my way. PS. The hot and sour was really good too!"}
{"text":"We went here to try the momos.  We had been searching for a great Tibetan place in mississauga. We were not diappointed. We tried the meat and veggie momo. I perfered the veggie. We also got tandoori chicken, goat stuffed Naan,  garlic Naan and Tikka masla paneer. We enjoyed all of our food. The service was great and even the owner came over to talk to us. Wish they had more traditional Tibetan food like tingmo and chicken gizzard. We will go back."}
