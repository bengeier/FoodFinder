{"text":"Love this restaurant. It's one of the last inexpensive, truly homestyle dining options in Cleveland. You can get homefries, pancakes, sausage, bacon AND eggs for under $6. It's simple but always tasty. The last time I was in there, the owner was still working behind the counter and making the food. I've been coming here since I was a kid."}
{"text":"Food is decent, staff is okay place was better with Marks and Anna. Cheap breakfast if you are looking for a quick bite, breakfast lunch you will be okay.service is not restaurant quality, but you get what you pay for. Not open late afternoons or for dinner"}
{"text":"I miss Marko and Anna. They moved to Florida,now that place has really gone downhill. It's sad and a shame. It use to be the best breakfast place ever"}
