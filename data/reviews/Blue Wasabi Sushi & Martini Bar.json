{"text":"My husband and I have been going here since they opened. They have amazing sushi. The wait to get in isn't too bad even on a Friday or Saturday evening . The atmosphere is \"chill\" and the drinks are great. When we want sushi, blue wasabi is the only place we will go."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Atmosphere was neat... very hip. Our waitress was very good... we never had to ask for refills. I also like the fact that all the sushi doesn't come out at once - one roll at a time is perfect.

We ordered several rolls: 
-Me So Horny (eh... 2-1/2 stars)
-Red Hot Chili Pepper (delicious!! 5 stars!)
-Yellowfin nigiri (succulent, melt-in-your-mouth fish... 5 stars)
-Spicy Crab Roll (good... 3 stars)
-Tootsie Roll (delicious! 5 stars)

We also had the Spicy Garlic Edamame. Yummy. 

For drinks, we had the Plum Wine (4 stars - good stuff!) and three different kinds of martinis: Lemon Head, Lemon Raspberry Ice, Strawberry Blonde. The martinis seemed to be missing a key ingredient: Alcohol. How can someone drink two martinis and not even feel a teensy-bit buzzed? For $9.50/each, I think you should be able to taste the alcohol or feel it. Disappointing.

Other than the alcohol - or lack there of - we had a fabulous time. Great sushi, great service, great atmosphere. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The worst we ordered a classic California roll since we hadn't been there before along with some spicy edamame and it's so bland, worst than gas station sushi. We asked the manager who confirmed sushi was indeed bad since its \"made for people who aren't into sushi\" suggested a pricey roll we gave that a try and just as sad and bland, their saki is mediocre, but I rather go to Osaka for good sushi."}
{"text":"We Love this place!! The SPICY ROCKIN' SHRIMP TEMPURA by far the best thing Ive had in a long time!! Also the Marilyn roll is Amazing!!! Great service Great drinks Great Sushi!! One of our favorite sushi places in the valley!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my happy place :) 

I love the sushi, the cocktails, the cool wall that changes color, the happy hour, and that they have yummy non-sushi items so my husband doesn't starve when he takes me there."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. Their sushi use to be so-so, now it is terrible. I tried the Salmon Eggs, Fresh Water Eel, Miso Soup, and Crusty Crab roll. All of the food I ate was bad. It was just consistently bad, worst sushi I have had. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went there tonight to grab a quick drink after dinner. We were both very disappointed with the service. We waited for at least 10 minutes while waiters scurried past us at least 6 times before we even got a hello. My fiancé ordered a house margarita and was given Cabo Wabo tequila and an extra 2 dollar charge for adding some lime juice and sweet and sour without being warned. Her drink ended up being more expensive than any other drinks on the menu and she could barely drink it because it was so poorly made. We asked the waiter and he just said...yeah that's how we do a margarita. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have only had good experiences at B.W.  The staff is helpful, I have always enjoyed the food, and their happy hour is awesome, both food wise and drinks!"}
{"text":"Just left. They said it was \"industry night\" for people in health/fitness field. Planned my whole night on this, the manager told the waitress to refuse the discount before even asking for any of our info. Maybe we were just the dirty black and brown people in the restaurant and they didn't want us to turn into regulars. When we started laughing and told the waitress we haven't provided any of the proof yet, she asked for it and we provided digital copies of pay stubs showing we are members of a fitness club in Tempe Arizona, along with our AZ ID's. Unfortunately for the manager, digital copies weren't good enough. I guess blue wasabi still lives in the 1990's and we have to print everything out. Blue wasabi is racist and chose to not have us come again, I'm embarrassed for taking my friends there and I sure as hell wouldn't take their word to honor a special they have that night. Literally, the manager told the waitress to refuse our discount before we provided any documentation. I'm humiliated. Don't take their word if they had any specials, their objective is to bring you in, have you order everything with the impression of a discount, and then screw you. Food is great, just too damn unfortunate."}
{"text":"I wish this place was good, it's not. I've eaten there many times and the last time was my last. My miso soup was cold I had to send it back... All of the rolls are a different version of a California roll and don't taste fresh to me. I went with my husband and for 1 appetizer and 3 rolls it was about $80.... That's without any alcohol too! We've added to our list of restaurants we don't eat at. Hopefully something better will take over soon!"}
{"text":"Happy hour prices are fantastic and the sushi is good but not great. The service my last two visits was poor. It's the subtle things they dont do like introducing yourself when waiting a table. Perhaps a smile or hi my name is. Nothing.  Very stale with an attitude like I don't want to be here.. 2 stars just because the sushi is good."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is a martini bar that happens to serve sushi. The menu had mostly cooked sushi options. The sushi was okay, not great. 

We got a spider roll, tuna roll, and an eel roll. The rice seemed a little over-cooked and gummy. They were generous with the amount of tuna in the tuna roll. 

We also got squid salad and crab wontons. The squid salad was average. The crab wontons were petty good. They come with a plum sauce that had the texture of apple sauce. Tasty, but strange."}
{"text":"I think Phoenix reviewers inflate the ranking of restaurants here to make it seem like there are a lot more real good restaurants (and there are, but Blue Wasabi isn't one of them) or they are simply very generous, or they have no idea what good cuisine is, or they give an extra star for creativity by having \"blue\" wasabi. I've learned to avoid listening to reviewers who give high ratings for average, at best, restaurants. 

What I like about Blue Wasabi - good service, decent drinks, different decor and look. 

What I don't like - For what you pay, this is average sushi. The sushi isn't cheap, so I had been expecting real fresh sushi. But, I was let down by the quality of the sushi and sashimi. The sashimi was actually better (but not saying much). But, the food here  was not as good as Sushi on Shea or Kyoto, both of which are considerably cheaper than Blue Wasabi. It's more of a scene place, somewhat trendy. But, I am not paying my money for the scene. I want good  food. And, frankly, Blue Wasabi falls short of that."}
{"text":"I agree that the prices of the food is high. It is best to go during happy hour. I have been here several times and have always had a pleasant experience.

My only gripe is the last time we visited here, we requested to sit outside. It was at night and we were sat right by the window with the \"OPEN\" sign. It was attracting bugs. Even the people sitting behind us were making comments. After 15 minutes of no server coming to give us water, we left and when to Kona Grill down the way. I think this was just a bad night. It looked like a lot of young, new people manning the tables.

I will return, but I will make sure that I am not sat in front of the window with the \"OPEN\" sign...at least during summer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...service is great, food is great, good looking staff...good prices....definetly coming back..way better than RA"}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is not your traditional sushi bar. The decor, music and menu are trendy and modern. And if you are wondering, yes they do have blue colored wasabi. Now with all that said, if you are more of a traditionalist this place might not appeal to you. You can find some traditional rolls, but most of them are of the \"fusion\" variety. This restaurant is a decent place to hang out, but I would considerate a \"sushi bar\". When I cannot order fish using their Japanese names it sort of detracts from the ambience of the joint.  Also that blue wasabi takes getting used to. Overall I would have to say food is ok, nothing special although a little pricey."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. However, it is my understanding that they use MSG in all of their sushi. I won't be going back until they remove that very harmful ingredient."}
{"text":"Happy hour sushi and $5 martini's...need I say more?! Even if you're not into sushi do yourself a favor and get a midday buzz without emptying your pockets!! I don't know if I was just parched from all the shopping I had done or if I just needed to taste that fruity, delicious, savory liquor on my lips but I had about 4 martini's and they were all FANTASTIC! I would say my favorite was the grape one, it smelled like grape punch or kool-aid but tastes so much better. The sushi was decent and offered the regular type rolls but there were a few that were creative and unique. \"Eating Nemo\" roll was sooo good, they place thin slices of lemon on top and it totally sets it off and gives it a crisp and different flavor - very refreshing.  The appetizer selection on happy hour is so/so, I didn't care for the crab wonton's at all and the sauce looked and tastes just like apple sauce from a can - gross. The chili edamame was delicious and I would def recommend getting those but nothing else on the app menu was too thrilling.  The waiter was super friendly and gave legit recommendations.  We sat on the patio and the weather was great...I never actually made it inside so not sure how dining inside would be.  The wasabi is actually blue which is a nice touch and makes the place memorable.  All in all, I was impressed with happy hour and would go back again...I'm drooling just thinking about that grape martini and can't wait until we meet again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out for one of our date nights. Overall the experience was okay. 

Atmosphere - The place was pretty hopping for a Tuesday night, but we got seated almost right away. The atmosphere was very \"clubby,\" not intimate or cozy. Definitely resembled a place you'd go to pick up someone or go with a group of friends. 
Service - The hostess and server were friendly enough. Our primary server was nice, but not very attentive. She only checked on us once during our meal. The gal who brought out our food was not very friendly and seamed to be in a rush. She'd run food out, curtly announce what it was, and then shove it onto the table and huff off. It could be that she was short-handed and was really busy, but it was a little off-putting. 
Drinks - We ordered a beer and a Wango Mango martini (we were delighted to find out that Tuesdays were Ladies Night with 1/2 price martinis. My husband asked our server if she could believe that he was a lady so he could get in on the deal. She was not amused). While the martini was tasty, it was weak and I could not justify ordering one for regular price. ($9.50 for a martini!? Yikes!)
Food - I appreciated the variety of the menu, from appetizers, to signature rolls there was a lot to choose from. Here is what we ordered:
       Pork Eggrolls - Yum! Nice and crispy, not greasy, and a delicious dipping sauce        to boot!
       Salmon Nigiri - Good portion size, tasted very fresh
       Dam Jumper - A little on the small size, a nice change-up of having the roll wrapped in salmon, the least favorite of the three rolls we ordered
       Tropic Thunder - Very, very good. Sweet and spicy, the pineapple salsa was an interesting and delicious addition, nice large-sized roll 
       Philadelphia - Your typical Philly roll, good size, very fresh tasting
Price - As mentioned before, martini prices were very steep. As for food, there were many higher priced rolls on the menu and almost everything seemed to be priced a dollar or two more than what's typically at most sushi establishments. 

So, overall, the food was good. Only a few things stood out as winners. But definitely not worth the price. As numerous reviewers have mentioned, go for happy hour. Then it may be worth it."}
{"text":"We wanted to try Blue Wasabi since it's located near our home and I had heard about it from friends.  If you're a big fan of sushi, this is not the place for you.  The sushi was mediocre...while they cleverly name their sushi, they don't deliver the quality and prices were slightly higher than usual.  The atmosphere is very Scottsdale-esqe, and could be fun if you and your girlfriends were going out for drinks as their martinis were awesome.  

They should nix the Sushi and simply be a martini bar."}
{"text":"New manager, Matt, us making Blue Wasabi relevant again.  Great sushi, rolls & martinis.  The Tuna Poke is excellent...try the \"Chuck Norris\" roll, edemame and miso soup with any of their martinis...it doesn't disappoint.  Ashley, on your first night serving, nice job!"}
{"text":"Not sure I'd ever want to order the \"Dirty Sanchez\" sushi roll (yes, that's the name of one of their rolls), but the sushi I ordered was great and the classic martini was perfect."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Good service. Never have had to wait for a table. Plenty of sushi bar seating."}
{"text":"I was EXTREMELY disappointed with Blue Wasabi on my visit last week. My server CHRIS (huge sideburns)  was horrible not a smile once. I Asked questions about the menu and he seemed like it was a hassle(they weren't even busy). I always go with the Chuck Norris roll and the Marilyn Monroe but wanting to try something new he was no help. He ruined my whole experience and I will never go back! I ended up with a chuck Norris, California roll, wango mango and a Me Soy Horny it took forever to be served to us and didn't seem so fresh like it had on other occasions. I watched him just stand there and ignore bringing us our food when it was ready. He waited for someone else to bring it to us. I asked another server if I could speak with a manager and She told me CHRIS was the manager. I will never go back for that reason and I will never recommend it either. You don't let fresh fish just sit or am I wrong?"}
{"text":"A friend of my wife's recommend this place to us and we're so glad that we went. We're both sushi rookies and we sat at the right spot at the bar. Mike Smith helped us with picking out things we would like and we even tried a few things we probably wouldn't have ordered on our own. EVERYTHING was GREAT!!  My wife is going to take the Sushi Class they offer. Thanks Mike for your guidance. 

Chuck & Lesli"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I actually am not a huge sushi fan, but my wife is.  She loves the sushi and I can actually eat and enjoy anything on the menu.  I think the difference between this place and other sushi bars is the freshness of the product and I like the happy hour prices. I've been there numerous times and have never had a bad experience.  I recommend this place!

PS A little tip, ask for the chopped Wasabi, not the colored stuff they give you.  SOOOO good."}
{"text":"Love this place...great creative sushi dishes and wonderful martini list. Had my birthday there and we had a blast."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place you notice that it is a pretty trendy place.  The setup is cool with quite a bit of people.  I was pretty excited to eat here since it seemed a little different than the normal sushi bar.  Too bad this was the really only good thing about this place.  

The sushi was not good, but it wasn't bad. What I really didn't like about this place was their trademark, their blue wasabi.  IT HAD NO KICK TO IT.  I'll admit one of things I love about sushi is the wasabi, and this was horrible wasabi, I made a paste out of soy sauce and this blue crap and still there was no kick.  Plus once you dip your sushi into it, it looks like something you pull out of a port-o-potty.  In the end the final bill was like $32 for a California roll, another roll, and 2 peices of salmon sashimi . I will not be returning.  

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is expensive, but it is really good. It is better to sit outside, it can get quite noisy inside, if you don't mind then it's ok. It is quite busy on weekend evenings, so they must be doing something right. Go to happy hour if you can, really good deals. The sushi is very yummy (although I am not sure how authentic it is) and the martinis are OK if the bartender puts any liquor in it!! (it can be watered down, but I also had them when they were very good, so it is not consistent!!) Altogether, if you are in the shopping area you can try it. There are also non sushi items on the menu which are really good."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to try it out.   It looked cool from the outside.  On the inside you would not think it was a sushi bar except for the soy bottles and chopsticks.  The owner was a tall skinny guy who was not really nice.  He seemed to be watching his employees like a pit boss and never smiled.  Our server was really cool tho.  Jake was his name.  He talked me into a berry white martini.   I had to send it back because there was lipstick on the rim .  I ordered some sashimi tuna,  a Chuck Norris and a dragon roll.  I'll be honest. I was not impressed. The other girls at my table were pretty disappointed in there meals too.  
We should have gone to kona on the other side of the parking lot.  The sushi at frys is even better than this place.   Do yourself a favor and go some place else.  They didn't even offer us any military discount .   Are you ashamed of our military that keeps you safe?"}
{"text":"If you love sushi and martinis this is the place for you! DC Ranch is a great location. It is a bit pricey, but worth well worth it. The service is good and the food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, pricy but happy hour prices are good (50% off). Not really filling, but nice customer service."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the only time this place is worth the effort. The portions are small, and all of the drinks are made with Skyy vodka and not much else. The servers aren't very friendly either,  and they seem to spend more time gossiping than taking care of customers. I'd rather take a risk at a hole in the wall sushi place... Blue Wasabi is no longer relevant and the 'blue' wasabi they serve with the sushi is ridiculous. I don't recommend this place to anyone in gilbert or scottsdale. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The rolls are really fresh and if you go during happy hour it is a great deal.  The only downside is that it is pretty popular and not all that big inside, so get there early."}
{"text":"Nice place with a pretty good atmosphere.  The food was not bad, but left something to be desired.  Admittedly, I have a high standard for sushi, but nothing exciting here.  To be fair they had a great selection of martinis and a trendy atmosphere.  Good place especially for Chandler."}
{"text":"Big Fan of the Sushi Bar (see other reviews)...the thing I think I love most, however, is the martinis!  True statement...the martinis are top notch and the sushi is very good.  Definitely 4 out of 5 stars on the food...the dumplings and plum sauce are excellent as is the Wango Mango roll.  For a great martini, good atmosphere and good service this place is a must visit!!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Good, fun sushi and martini place.  They have traditional sushi rolls as well as as their own \"signature rolls.\"  Many of these feature ingredients like cream cheese, chicken, beef or mango.  It may sound odd but many of them are very good.  I recommend the big apple roll or the where's the beef roll.  

The martinis are the best part.  They are quite simply the best I have had in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Most of them are more on the sweet side (key lime pie, pineapple, mango, chocolate, etc.) and all the ones I have tried are great.  Wear blue on Sunday nights for 1/2 off drinks ($4.50 martinis...pretty good deal).

Cool atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Love the Marilyn Monroll.  Good Happy Hour, wish there was more Nigiri on the HH menu"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband on a Saturday evening, not during happy hour. Cons: The food is way over priced, the portions are extremely small, and the sushi tastes awful. I've had better sushi at an irish pub in New Mexico...that should just about explain it. If I ever go back it will be during happy hour for drinks and a snack that does not consist of sushi."}
{"text":"My wife and I are always looking for a good sushi place and a friend recommended that we try Blue Wasabi. Server was awesome, we were sat promptly however, a tall, sickly looking man with grey hair and a man bun (who we later found out was the owner) ruined the experience completely. On top of screaming at his staff like an angry child with turrets, he kept walking around the restaurant like someone who just came off of a week long coke binge. When he wasnt irrationally yelling at his staff he was at a table next to us talking to a couple who were obviously celebrating and obviously annoyed with his presence. He was blabbering about the 70s and showing them pictures of himself and talking about himself for over an hour. In one visit we concluded that the staff is great but the owner is an egotistical narcissist who desperately tries to be relevant while annoying his guests and disrespecting his own staff. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant to eat at in the gilbert/chandler area. The staff is friendly and attentive, food always amazing, and drinks are strong. The ambiance is great and I love the color changing lights behind the bar. They had no problem customizing me vegetarian rolls. Go here on Sunday for 1/2 off drinks! I recently moved out of the state and miss it so much."}
{"text":"The martinis are so sweet! To me the only one worth getting is the margarita martini, at least u can tell there is liquor in it the others I have tried are syrup and who knows what else The GIRLS that greet u at the door could look a bit happier. We got 4 rolls all were very good. Gordan gecko, eating nemo,shrimp bisket and chuck norris. Chuck noris had more kick than the wife likes but I enjoyed it. Want 2 go back soon.  The place could use a really GOOD cleaning though."}
{"text":"oh so Scottsdale, which is why i love it. Truly the place to take your cousins from the mid west to see their eyes pop out of their skull with the trendy decor, $100,000 cars in the lots, and more plastic surgery than Beverly Hills. Their food is so good it makes me wanna cry. Being a Northie, originally, I used to go to the one in DC Ranch. Now, it is gone. It was so small in there I didn't even care waiting an hour for a squished seat to rub elbows with the cougars. When it moved South, (and I moved to Flagstaff *shutter*) I have been there about 5 or 6 times. AMAZING martinis. Decent beer selection (I like kirin, so no biggie) and the signature sushi is awesome. WARNING: this is not \"authentic\" sushi, it is trendy, innovative, Scottsdale sushi, but hell is it good. The rock shrimp appetizer is so good my mom and I order 2. The best rolls are: the surf and turf, the mango wango, and the squid viscious. The BEST they ever had was the Spiccoli Roll. They rid of it like a year and a half ago. If I am ever on death row, I will request that as my last meal. It is pricey, but a good place to make your parents take you on your birthday or with your gal pals to share on a Saturday night. I honestly love this place and miss it like, everyday. Best trendy sushi ever. Best rock shrimp. Wait staff is young and trendy and pretty good. Go!!!"}
{"text":"Our weekly trip to Blue Wasabi. Always good. But today we tried a Trump Roll. Interesting flavors.
Happy hour sushi is always a great price along with the martini's good service and friendly faces"}
{"text":"Well, i'd only come here during happy hour. Good drink menu and a tasty mango martini (wango mango.) I just don't think the sushi is worth the high price when it's not happy hour, sorry my blue friend..."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the greatest with half price martinis on Sunday!  The sushi is good, but the martinis are what makes this place the best.  If you like spicy the surf and turf \"blaze\" style is the best (but Blaze has to be working to get it)."}
{"text":"It was okay. Overpriced for average quality food. Don't think I 
would ever go again.

The wasabi was blue."}
{"text":"This unique sushi/martini bar features a 50% off menu from Tuesday until Saturday during Happy Hour! While perusing the menu, the servers actually bring out blue wasabi for the sushi. So that's where the name comes from.

As much as I had wanted to order a drink called Nice Melons, it wasn't half off for Happy Hour. So I went with the Berry White instead. Good Lord that thing was dangerous and tasted like a Jolly Rancher.

While I would have loved to order the Dirty Sanchez or Me Soy Horny rolls just for the sheer comedic value of saying those in public, at a classy bar no less, I wasn't too thrilled with the ingredients. So instead my friend and I split the Eating Nemo and the Wango Mango rolls. Along with a slew of appetizers.

We had two 8-piece rolls, three appetizers and three drinks for under $40 (and enough leftovers for a third lunch/dinner)! It was really amazing sushi. And it led to waaay too many inappropriate jokes. Good times."}
{"text":"The Martinis are awesome! They have alot of alcohol in one, so it is well worth the money. And the fact that they are half priced on Sundays= SCORE. The sushi is fairly good. The drinks are primarily my go to there."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and I was not impressed.  The drinks were quite good, the food was ok, decor was fine...but the service was terrible.  A group of my friends met for happy hour.  We ordered our first round of drinks at 5:30 and filled out our sushi menus.  The menus sat on our table for close to 20 minutes.  Then the server came by to tell us that it was last call for happy hour and did we want another round of drinks.  We agreed to that.  When she came back with our drinks, she said she hadn't gotten to the computer on time, so nothing we ordered would be at the happy hour prices.  

I understand s**t happens, but what about taking responsibility for your mistakes?  No apology, no alternatives offered.  Didn't even ask us if we wanted to cancel the order since it was going to cost twice what we had expected it to.  In any decent restaurant, this is something the manager would have taken care of, but no manager acknowledged our existence.  They lost six customers."}
{"text":"Yuck. Slimy salmon. Warm fish. Server not too interested. $102 later we are still hungry and don't feel too good. Bummer."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Great food, drinks, atmosphere!  Nice cool place to relax! Would recommend to anyone! Go during happy hour, you'll save quite a bit on the specials at that time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Great quality sushi, and small plates. Recommend the chicken & waffle roll. I dont know why it works, but it is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wow- the number of stars this place has are way off.  Must be the competition down-rating or something.  If you take into account some of the low reviews...I think some of it could fall back upon the reviewer for maybe A) eating mac/cheese at a sushi joint, B) not asking the person on the phone to review your to-go order, C) Sorry, not sorry...

Seriously.  Stop doing whatever it is you are doing.  Change your dinner plans...stat!
This place is AMAZING.

I went about a week ago with a large group and we sat at the community table in the middle.  We tried a little bit of a lot of things and I was not disappointed in one single thing.  I think we tried the Philly Cheesesteak, Chicken and Waffles, Chuck Norris, Dam Jumper, Double D, Tail-er Swift, Tropic Thunder at a minimum for the rolls and some shrimp tempura along with a salmon plate that had a wasabi oil and a dab of wasabi on top.

I loved every single item but I think the Dam Jumper and the salmon plates were my favorite.  I have seriously told at least 10 people this week how amazing this place is because I can't stop thinking about it.  I don't even live that close but my husband and I agreed that we don't care to go anywhere else for sushi anymore and will make the drive to go to this place.

The salmon on the salmon plate melted in my mouth like butter because the fish was so incredibly perfect and fresh.  

I didn't try any of their martinis except for a small sip of the one my friend was having (I think it was strawberry or raspberry).  It was very tasty and would have gone down too easily several times.  Therefore, I stuck with beer, ha!

If you like good sushi, you have to try this place out.  It is seriously delicious.  I really, honestly don't understand how you could not give this place 5 stars unless you went to a sushi place for some reason and don't eat sushi.  Even then, they have some items without fish such as the chicken and waffle roll and Philly cheesesteak roll I mentioned above, which are delicious!

Ambiance was great and so was the service.  He automatically put us on our own tab rather than combining us all into one large group.  Super thoughtful and convenient.

We will be repeat customers and make the 25-minute trek or so to eat here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it will be my last also.   My wife and I ordered 3 small plates, one of the plates was the mac & cheese.  The server warned me that this item is just like Kraft macaroni & cheese from the box.   I could not believe a restaurant of this quality with a real chef would serve such a thing.   My mistake, I was served Kraft macaroni & cheese.   Any restaurant that does not pay much attention to the small details is making a mistake.   In the case of Blue Wasabi it would be a smart move to remove this item from the menu.   It certainly has given me a reason to not give them any more of my business.   On the plus side, our server was very good at her job, I should have listened to her."}
{"text":"We have been to Blue Wasabi before for sushi and drinks, but nothing stacked up to the sushi class experience.

I took my husband to the sushi class for his birthday.  This class FAR exceeded my expectations for great food and fun! Mike, our sushi chef/instructor was amazing and kept the class moving and having a good time.  We will be recommending it to everyone we know that loves great sushi and wants to learn from a pro.

If you are looking for a fun, creative and memorable experience for a date or special occasion, check out the class."}
{"text":"Awesome place great sushi and drinks. Happy hour is awesome. Can't beat 50% off. Happy hour is from 4 to 6. My wife and I come here at least three times a month or more. By far the best sushi in the area and the service is usually very good. Get clucked and kaboom are great rolls."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is sooo delicious and all of the staff are really friendly!"}
{"text":"During my visit to AZ for Thanksgiving of this year, my father, sister, husband and I went for sushi to Blue Wasabi during happy hour (one of the CONs to living in Massachusetts- No HH). After having over 100 dollars of 1/2 priced sushi, we were stuffed like the turkey the following day---- this is my review. The decor was ok and modern. The room isn't really warm or welcoming, I was expecting more than the wall  behind the bar changing colors. The sushi is ok at HH pricing, but I definitely would have felt cheated paying full price. The quality of the sushi seemed like everything everyone else uses, so ok (not the true off the boat quality that we get in Mass.- PRO). The martinis were thankfully half priced too bc they were really weak and tasted the juice. At first I thought that they were just maid correctly, yet were not strong...then I saw the bartender make my second and it was pretty much all juice. The service was again just ok... We had to ask our waitress for \"blue\" wasabi twice! I mean come on it is the name of the restaurant, something not to forget! Oh well, bc my dad likes it we will probably go back, but this time I will be ready for ok service, food, and decor. Damn I said OK a lot!!!!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour menu for food and drinks. The service was good even though it was very busy. The happy hour red wine was a good tasting wine."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour which is from 4-6pm. You get 1/2 off everything with a \"smiley\" face next to it. I ordered the Berry White martini. It is a blueberry martini, very similar to the Deja Blue at Pearl, pretty good. It had some disgusting bumpy berry in the bottom of the glass...eeww. 
We ordered the Salmon nigri (1/2 off). The flavor was OK but it was really soft, aka mushy. Then we ordered the Eating Nemo roll. My dining partner and I took a bite and almost lost it. Something was wrong. We sent it back. 
The crowd was a weird mix of ridiculous cougars and families. Weird scene... 

We asked for our check and left to find some place better. 

Go to one of the other many sushi bars in the area."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi has a similar atmosphere to RA: loud music, bar feel. It's hip and cool. The wasabi is (of course) blue, but this does not affect the taste. As far as the actual sushi goes, it is made with good quality, fresh fish. Blue Wasabi also has the traditional spread of rolls as well as new and innovative combinations. I have not eaten everything here, but I have been impressed with what I have eaten."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We have been many times and were so happy when they opened this location in Gilbert. The manager is great and always remembers us, even though we only come in about once a month or so. The sushi is always good and consistent. Love their happy hour menu. They have a nice variety on their menu to cater to sushi fans. The martinis are awesome. We love that we can come here and they have sports on the TV's. By and far some of the best sushi in the valley."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is trying to be trendy, but it doesn't have the snotty atmosphere (yet). Our server was awesome and the food was great, too. I love the funky names they give to their rolls - you can expect to see names like \"Marilyn Monroll,\" \"Squid Vicious,\" \"Big Apple\" and *gulp*... Eating Nemo\" on the menu. They also serve teppanyaki, which is refreshing. I wasn't too keen on the martinis there, but none the less, it was still a fun place to eat at. Plus. picking at the blue wasabi was interesting.

There is a huge tea-style table in the middle for big groups, and even if you're not in a big group, you might be seated there... kinda like Benihana's. So if you want some privacy, make sure you reserve a table ahead of time on weekends."}
{"text":"As much as I want to hate this trendy bastardized sushi restaurant I can't.  
The prices are a bit high, so I usually only go for happy hour.  Also I stay away from the silly rolls, but that's my plan at any sushi place.
I have found that if I stick to their signature sushi and small plates I actually have a good time.  Their standard sushi is mediocre though.
The service is great, but the crowd can be a little annoying at times.
So- go at happy hour, stick to the signature apps and sushi and it's a great place."}
{"text":"Well folks...it is a sad, sad day up in North Scottsdale.

Blue Wasabi in DC Ranch has served its last piece of sushi.  They were closed as of Saturday.  

FYI: it is rumored that Kevin, the owner, did not want to renew his lease.  Also closing will be San Felipe across the street."}
{"text":"Great if you are a contrived frat boy d-bag. If you know what a dirty sanchez is you don't want to eat a sushi roll named that. Wasabi is dyed electric blue, not appealing. Sushi not very good either."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a little food coloring in their wasabi?!

I'm not into getting gimmicky with my food. It's food.
I just want to first take a picture of it and then eat it, alright?

I was pleasantly surprised with this trendy, modern sushi bar...blue food coloring and all! Out of the three sushi rolls we had.. two were awesome...one not so much. Since my friends and I are adventurous with our sushi..this was a great outcome!

I would highly recommend this place for date night or a quick meet-up. 
The service is fast and professional. 

And not gimmicky at all."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The drinks are delicious, I recommend the Sake Bombs and the Milky Way Martini. The place had a classy setting, the food was delicious, and the menu has character. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The food, the decor, the happy hour.. \"sigh'. I will miss this place as much as I will miss my friends out in Arizona. I just came back from visiting & I am so glad we went to Blue Wasabi. 

I'm not going to sit here & list everything I ate. All i'm going to say is EVERYTHING I ate was good. My friends & I ordered most of the Happy Hour menu. 

To drink I had a cherry bomb. Words can not describe the happiness that was my lips & tongue. JOY JOY JOY! I have NEVER had a drink as good as that one & trust me, I've had ALOT of drinks. 

Don't be intimidated by the fact that the guys behind the bar are not Japanese. They are trained sushi chefs & have years of experience. 

If I could, I would move to Arizona just so I can be closer to the Blue Wasabi. Oh, & the customer service was on point. 

GO!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing that's all I got to say. The martinis are amazing the sushi is PERFECT. Not too overdone with crazy flavors. Just perfect amount of ingredients. I love the one with the mandarin oranges. The martinis are so great. I literally want to go back and try them all. I am looking forward to coming back and couldn't stop talking about it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great happy hour, friendly staff and great speciality rolls! Not to mention their martinis are amazing, actually beyond amazing! Chris at the bar is a huge asset to BW, great bar tender, made great drinks and such a cool person to chat with while having a few drinks and watching the game. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Blue Wasabi!! They have such a fun and creative Martini list. I have tried a bunch of them but my absolute favorites and I get them both every time include the bellinitini and the milky way. Giiiiiiiirl if you haven't had these martinis, you are missing out! Their food is amazing ad well. I love their get clucked sushi roll and the shrimp bizkit roll. I was a super big fan of the chicken and waffles sushi roll (a. I think it tastes great with a maple drizzle on top. And b. It is so ceeatuve. I have never seen that anywhere else). For non-sushi I normally share an order of edamame, drunken bbq shrimp (DIVINE!!), And the spicy mayo rock shrimp. Don't forget to save room for the chocolate rainbow roll at the end of the meal. I thought having dessert was kinda crazy and werid at a sushi joint. Which it is but it was also killer."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and really like the food. We dont tend to take too many risks when it comes to sushi so we typically order what we like. Anything with tuna, crab, salmon etc...Starters and sides are always good. Everything is always on point.

With the name comes a little hook. The wasabi they serve is dyed blue which is kind of odd. If you put some wasabi in your soy sauce, like I do...It turns your rice blue and eventually....your teeth. Just odd. You can ask for natural green wasabi and they'll bring you some.

Like others have said, the drinks are a little light. If they loosen the bar up a little and bring me green wasabi....its all good. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner. We had about 10 people in our group and Eric was our server. He was awesome! Learned all of our names, got orders correctly, made great recommendations and was very personable. Definitely helped make it a great night. Everyone got different things as far as food and all was delicious. I had a little bit of everything and it was great. I even got a dessert complimentary for my birthday! Some other reviews talked about it being expensive but I really didn't find it more expensive than other similar sushi places. The happy  hour menu looked really great and if you have a problem with the prices, happy hour seems ideal. 

The only thing that I was confused about was the reservation. I called the week before and asked if I was supposed to make a reservation for a large party and the girl told me yes. I called back the next week on Tuesday to make my reservation for Friday. The girl I talked to that time told me they don't take reservations. (?) She said they take \"call aheads\" which are oddly similar to a reservation. So I booked my \"call ahead\" and they called me Friday to confirm my \"call ahead\". So I'm not sure what that was about but I had an excellent time and definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that Blue Wasabi used to be my favorite restaurant. When they first opened they had amazing sushi that was far better than Ra. I felt that way for years, but recently things have been changing. The last few times I have eaten here, the sushi just hasn't been the same. The rolls have been loose and fall apart as soon as they are picked up. It makes for a messy meal. It also doesn't taste the same, the food just isn't as flavorful. I don't know what is going on, but they need to check themselves. I still appreciate their happy hour and their quick service, but I find myself looking around for better sushi now. If it weren't for years of happiness prior to the last year than I would have given them 2 stars instead of 3."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Blue Wasabi for their Happy Hour and we arrived promptly at 4pm when it began...which is a good thing because the place was full shortly after!

I'm slightly confused by their Happy Hour, as on their website it says one thing but in the restaurant its another.   I don't really care because either way you're getting cheap sushi.  To say that the sushi is nontraditional is an understatement!   If the Philadelphia rolls are listed under the \"\"Traditional Rolls\" then you know the signature rolls will be insane.   

And they were.  In addition to the Philly roll, we had the Me-So-Horny roll, a Dirty Sanchez and the Killer Bee.   The Killer Bee roll was phenomenal.   All the rolls we ordered were 50% off.  We also had a rock shrimp tempura appetizer that was really good and was the most expensive thing we ordered at $14!   My favorite part was the one dessert they have....tempura apples in caramel with cream and cinnamon.  Seriously they are SO good.   My husband wants to break out our deep fryer to try to make them ourselves.  They have a long martini menu too but I like to have champagne with sushi and non of the martinis had \"bubbles\".   Although it was very busy they didn't mind us lingering for a few drinks after our meal."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is the place to go for Sushi when you want to have a great dining experience for adults without screaming kids ( although the last time I went there was a family with well behaved children there).It's casual,the food is EXCELLENT and so is the service. Great atmosphere and I'd recommend it to everyone who likes this type of food."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere,food and martinis. My husband and I do not eat sushi but I love Martinis so we decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious their other food options were, we tried drunk shrimp, orange chicken and chicken skewers with yakatori sauce. For me the smaller plates are wonderful because I when get full easily when I am having a cocktail but the portions are definitely not meal sized portions. The size is perfect for those looking for a light bite with a cocktail. I love the Pom Pom martini and the Barry white, but the Wango Mango was too sweet for my taste, and I love sweets. I do wish they offered the same menu items in a larger portion as an option because I would love to take my Father here but he would not enjoy the portion size for the price, some people just don't do tapas I guess, and it would be nice to have a larger meal sized option."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, went for our anniversary got there at 4pm on Saturday the restaurant was not even 1/2 full we got placed in back room and I requested to be in the main room. The host then sat us at the table closest to the kitchen. Needless to say, we left disappointed. The host was not pleasant and the experience was again disappointing since it was a special occasion."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on a Friday night.

Crispy rice tuna w/Jalapeno  4/5

Taylor Swift roll 5/5 hamachi...

Anago nigiri 5/5

Salmon roll with asparagus (forgot the name) 5/5

Filet Mignon appetizer 5/5 (superb, steakhouse quality)

Chuck Norris 3/5 dry?

Setting 4/5.  Big screen with no sporting event, brings it down to a 3/5. The Patio on the busy street, so, so.

Nevertheless, the food is surprisingly good!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Just bad sushi. Bad attempt at sushi fusion. Bad attempt at wasabi. The martinis were nothing special either. Just yuck. Sushi is my favorite food and this was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place in the Valley. Creative sushi with the most friendly server team!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night. Service was awful. Food came out wrong 3 different times. The food itself was pretty terrible, made me sick later that night. You'd think they would Comp the meal, or at least take off 1 roll, instead they gave us desert, which was pretty subpar. 90$ bill with no alcoholic beverages is pretty insane. Especially when you can go 500 ft up the street to a different sushi restaurant, for about half the price. Also, saw the manager chew one of the waitresses out, which in my experience in the food industry (about 4 years) is unacceptable and should not be seen by patrons. All in all, this was in my top 10 for worst experiences in a restaurant. I am not the type of person to write a yelp review, or really complain. But, this felt completely necessary. How can you mess up 3 times? When the order is written down at the table on time menu, and on their fancy tablet order system?! I wouldn't of minded if the server or food runnner came back to check if the order was correct. Would like to speak to a manager if possible. But according to the rest of the reviews here(which sound like horror stories) that probably won't happen."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  I love the Spicy Rock'n Shrimp Tempura and the Orange Julius Cocktail w/Tito's Vodka. I usually order Shrimp Tempura Roll to go with it. Fun atmosphere, come as you are!  If you love sports they have Flat screens every where. Indoor outdoor eating.  This place never never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I've had sushi from all over and Blue Wasabi is my favorite spot. Wish I had one close to where I live now. Any of the rolls are great and service is always top notch. 

Small recommendation - sit outside. The lighting is a bit dark inside."}
{"text":"Mango wango is awesome. I have been here a dozen times it is fun, lively every time. Staff has always been good and nice."}
{"text":"The service was even better than the food, and that's saying a lot! The tuna was so fresh and everything was prepared quickly. The blue cheese medallions were out of this world. My future husband and I nearly died. They even offered complimentary dessert for my birthday!! Too bad we filled up on delicious sushi! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my birthday at Blue Wasabi and could not have been happier.  Our server was super nice and gave us great recommendations.  The BBQ Drunken Shrimp was really good.  I had never had anything like it, and wished I ordered two or three more orders.  The Rock Shrimp Tempura was outstanding as well.  I wish I ordered five or ten of them.  
I also had the seared tuna, which was good, but hard to stack up to our other shrimp-tacular meals. :)
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Called today to order take out. They answered the phone, laughed and hung up. Tried calling back and it went straight to vm. You're open...do you not do pick up orders?!"}
{"text":"Steven provided excellent service.  Not only did he pay special attention to my kids, he smiled and was happy to be working.  He never let our drinks go dry!  He had great suggestions and improvised so that the kids did not end up with spicy garlic etemame(sp?).  I ordered Gordan Gecko and loved it!  It had chunks if fresh jalapeño, the crunch and kick were amazing.  I also had a grape martini and it was delicious.  My family said they served the best miso soup they've ever had!  My youngest son loves the shrimp Bizcut(chipotle mayo on the side).  My oldest always gets the boring ol' California Roll.  He loves it, that's what matters.  My hubs had three different rolls and scarfed them all down.  In his language this signifies his high approval.  The Suns game was playing and they were winning!!!  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I used to like blue wasabi.

Admittedly, I liked other sushi places better.  Blue wasabi was more of a drinking place with decent sushi, and I don't mean decent like not indecent--I mean decent like eh, it was decent.

this place has the acoustics of a mess hall.  annoying. but what really annoyed me was this:

one time I was there with wife and in-laws, and because I have a ridiculously sensitive palate (at least when it comes to salt) I noticed right away that there was some foul shit happening with the soy sauce.  By foul shit, I mean that they were serving the low sodium version.  *pauses for ensuing outrage*

Now they serve their soy sauce in little innocuous looking devices that don't come with the courtesy of a green or red lid.  What this means is that innocent people were unwittingly eating low sodium soy sauce.  Which is punishable by law, or divine retribution when \"kingdom\" finally \"comes.\"  anyway....

So I ask for the manager, and say: \"is this low sodium soy sauce?\" And he says: \"Yes.\"  And I say: \"Can I please have some *real* soy sauce?\" And he says: \"we don't serve anything but low sodium soy sauce.\"

One fucking star, and be glad you got even that.  You should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to come grab a quick bite to eat while out for a relaxing shopping day. It's located at San Tan Mall. They have the best spicy edamame and wonderful drinks!! I would recommend the \"berry white\" martini! The service is on point and very fast! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Good Happy Hour prices on food and drinks!

This place is great!  I have no idea why everyone crowds to Kona down the way, when this place is less crowded, has good food and the services has always been good. Also it is cheaper and has a better offering of sushi.

I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Well, first things first.  Happy hour is WAY WAY too short.  It only lasts from 4-6.  After you get past that you find that on the menu there are only certain things that are available for happy hour and that none of the traditional rolls (caterpillar roll) are included.  Happy hour is tuesday through saturday instead of monday through friday.   If you get past that though the atmosphere is good and the food is pretty decent too.  Sushi rolls are a little small but other than that it is good sushi for half price.  There is no way i'm paying full price for this though."}
{"text":"Visited again for NYE and I couldn't believe on a Saturday and a holiday they still do happy hour- but they do! I thought the blue wasabi was a cool feature but now that I have had fresh chopped, I am even more amazed. Ask for the fresh chopped wasabi next time you go!"}
{"text":"Took my beautiful wife here for her seventh 29th birthday.  I have to start off by saying that I love the decor of this place.  It's just got a really cool feeling to it and its very casual and relaxing. 

We ordered a gang of food, more than is probably smart for two people to consume but whatever.  The first thing we had was some miso soup and a cucumber salad.  Both were good, but really, if your at a place that messes up miso soup and a cucumber salad you should just leave.

The next thing to come out was our spicy garlic edamame.  Ever since the first time I had garlic edamame at a place I have yet to write a review for I've made it my sole purpose in life to order it whenever I can.  Unfortunately this time it didn't stack up.  It had too much siracha (I'm probably butchering the spelling of that but you can figure it out) on it and not enough garlic.  It just wasn't anything special.

Next up was the BBQ drunken shrimp.  This was really good.  I'm not entirely sure what was in the sauce it's floating in but I was tempted to take the straw out of my tea and drink it up (I didn't, but yeah... It was good).

The birthday girl ordered seared tuna.  She said it was okay.  Since I'm not a tuna fan, I can't comment on it.  But I'll take her word for it.

Then they brought us some rock shrimp tempura something.  This was stupid good.  I mean, really really stupid good.  Borderline retarded.  It was the best thing we ordered.  In hindsight I could have ordered five of these things and eaten myself into a coma.  The doctor at the ER would know what I had because of the smile on my face and the massive bulge in my stomach.  You know, if I had the ability to do something like that.

Last was the Chernobyl beef.  Apparently this must be really hot by some people's standards but it really wasn't that bad.  It was pretty good, and perhaps if I had that before the shrimp instead of after I might have enjoyed it more.   Honestly, that damn shrimp ruined me for anything else on that menu.  Forever.

To sum it all up, I really enjoyed this place.  I liked how they brought things out as it was done and staggered it so you weren't overwhelmed.  The service was great from everyone we encountered.  And if you take nothing else from this review, remember, rock shrimp tempura thing = OMGWTFGOOD."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is a favorite of ours. While it is a bit overpriced normally, their happy hour is stellar. We typically get the Badda Bing and a couple of avocado rolls. Great service, fun atmosphere, good restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. .. good service,   tasty drinks and food  .. good place to chill with friends .."}
{"text":"Having worked at the San Tan Village mall for almost a year, I am a frequent visitor of Blue Wasabi. I always liked their different take on common sushi rolls and the unique rolls they offered that you can't get anywhere else.

Because of this, I asked a girlfriend of mine to meet me for drinks and sushi at Blue Wasabi last week. She had never been there before and I was talking up how awesome the place was. 

The minute we walked in, the manager (a gentleman I am familiar with, real Rico Suave looking kind of guy) asked us if we'd like to sit inside or outside. We said we'd take a spot outside. He turned to a hostess and said \"will you check if any tables are available outside?\" She walked to the door and looked through the glass to check. He practically shouted at her \"I meant you need to physically walk your body outside, look around and see if a table is open.\" Then he smiled at my friend and I as if this was a normal way to interact with your employees. 

It got worse from there. Our server, a guy whose name I didn't even bother to remember, looked dirty and unkempt. He referred to my friend and I as \"dude\" and \"bro\" from the very beginning. He also finished each sentence with \"yo\". For example, \"Bro, you want some water, dude, yo?\" (I swear, I can't make this up.) 

We decided to laugh about it. Anyway, we put in a sushi order. After an hour, we did not receive our sushi. We asked our server where the sushi was. He said \"Dude, I don't think it got made, yo.\" Well, no kidding. \"Yeah, bro. Yo, I'll put in that order now, dude.\" 

We eventually got our sushi. We were having girl time. It was not really that big of a deal. Eventually, another girl joined us and we ended up ordering more drinks. By the time we had been there for two hours, our server believed we were his friends and started to curse at us in addition to using \"bro\", \"dude\" and \"yo\" as his go to's. We started hearing, \"Yo, that f***ing sushi roll is dope, bro.\" 

The highlight of the night came at 11 pm when the restaurant closed. We had paid our tabs ($200 between the three of us, by the way) and were finishing our last rounds of Sake. At 11:03, they shut the lights outside off and the music. At 11:10, our server came out and handed us 3 styrofoam cups, poured our alcoholic drinks in the cups and said \"Here. Take your drinks to go, yo. No rush, bro. But you gotta go, dude.\" 

Most unprofessional, horrifying experience at any restaurant I've ever had. We were not valued, we were treated like an inconvenience and booted off the patio of the restaurant with alcohol in styrofoam cups. 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Like any other Sushi restaurant the prices are pretty high for the amount of sushi you get, meaning you would have to buy more sushi to fulfill your stomach.

The only difference with Blue Wasabi are that they have happy hour on a Saturday. Selected sushi and drinks are half off. Their happy hours are the only times I would go when I am craving for sushi. 

Their selection of sushi are excellent. I love the Wango Mango if you have not been to this place you should, and when you are there definitely try their wango mango. 

The only bad review I would have to say about this restaurant are that it is not at all that big during happy hour it gets pretty crowded and the music is a little loud. When you have a big group its hard to talk to everyone. You would have yell and even then some would not be able to hear you. 

Overall their sushi is great!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The food is delicious, the martinis are strong and tasty, and we always have a great experience. I love the Chuck Norris roll and the Agent Orange martini (that Tang on the rim!). This place is one of my faves!"}
{"text":"Every time we come into blue wasabi, the service is super quick, friendly and food also comes out quickly. Have never had any issues with service or food at Blue Wasabi! The food is fantastic and fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

First of all, I never really care what kind of chair I'm sitting in but I immediately noticed how amazingly comfy the bar seats are. I could relax here all day!
Anyway...
We tried this place out on a Sunday afternoon, they have 1/2 off drinks all day. During the week they have 1/2 off sushi and drinks but I did not mind paying regular price for how good it was! We ordered 3 rolls: Shrimp Bizkit - SO delish! My new favorite :) We also ordered the Marilyn Monroll (raw, huge sushi rolls!) and the Kaboom (california roll with, quite literally, a huge pile of shrimp and krab on top! Bring your appetite for this one.)
Our bartender was great, she was extremely friendly and fun to talk with. We tried out their sake bomber and were given a plethora of [generously sized] martini samples! Definitely did not walk in their with the intention to drink for a Sunday afternoon, but was happy about trying some samples for the next time we visit :) 
5+++ Stars!!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card for Blue Wasabi, which we may have never tried it if we hadn't had a gift card! But we are so glad we did! Everyone at our table loved every roll we ordered-we will definitely be back! They wouldn't let us make a same day reservation, but they will do call ahead seating so we didn't have to wait very long for a table!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, drinks and atmosphere. One of my wife's favorite places to go for \"date night\". Crab won tons are a great starter and we love the sushi. It can get a little loud during peak or happy hour on Friday/Saturday but it's not overbearing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff are super kind. There are a lot of martini options for sure which I personally enjoy. The glasses are full and very flavorful. The sushi was good, not a lot of pieces for the price. So if you're super hungry maybe go for the lower pricing rolls. Also, the restaurant interior is large with small chairs and not a lot of walking room. Be mindful if you even have a big bag, you may hit something. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Tombstone!!!!!
Enough said, better be able to take the heat!!!
Awesome Joint!!
Good atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"When I went there (Ive been multiple times) off the bat there is hardly anyroom. If you are in a wheel chair, you literaly wont be able to eat there. Which is fine for me but still uncomfortable.
I  poured the soy sauce out, it was black and old. 
When soy goes bad it turns black, taste bitter and like pure salt. They had obviously never changed out the soy in their bottles. It goes bad in a day w/o refridgeration.  For me this is a sign of poor food handling. 

The fish had a very fishy flavor and a terrible texture. Actually I have got minor food poisoning there 2 times. 

Go to Roka Akor if you are looking for fresh creative food. AMAZING, I will never go anywhere else.

They use no hydrogenated oils or preservatives. Freshest cleanest tasting food ever.!!!!"}
{"text":"Catching up with my girls in Gilbert over few of our favorite sushi rolls! I love that Blue Wasabi brings you pink ginger and \"blue\" wasabi to accompany your sushi rolls. 

Make sure to try the $5.00 martinis on Sundays"}
{"text":"I have been to sushi places all over California and Arizona. This is by far the best service hands down my wife and i have ever had. Absolutely amazing place with great food and diverse menu. I will be back every week to show my respect to how great of service we recieved. Our server was Brian and this guy is on point!!!! HE WAS SWEATING HE WAS WORKING SO HARD!!! Thats what i call good service. Again the BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"I HATE Blue Wasabi. I had the WORST experience here. You couldn't pay me to consume that repulsive crap they call \"Sushi\". 
Quick summary of my experience.... My boyfriend and I went on a date. We sat on the patio. It took FOREVER to get our food. Granted it was kinda busy, we only ordered 2 rolls & some edamame. It shouldn't take an hour & a half. The waiter offered no apologies or explanation. The rice was sooo stale & dry. Sushi looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. We couldn't even choke it down. It was horrible, no joke. 
Then some poor girls purse was stolen right from the patio. Some dickhead drove up to the patio, his friend jumped out & snatched this womans purse who was dining on the patio. 
It was a horrible experience. Blue Wasabi SUCKS!"}
{"text":"We go for happy hour a lot. They have happy hour 6 days a week from 4-6pm. They have a lot of flavored vodka martini drinks for $5.

The service is great & the happy hour prices even better. The only dish that is sub par is the macaroni & cheese. But that's what I get for ordering it at a sushi place!"}
{"text":"Really good options during their happy hour. We ordered five different plates and it only cost us $38. My favorite was the Chuck Norris Roll!"}
{"text":"Most likely last time I go to this place. Decided to go last minute to try something new and had a great martini selection but the waitress charged me $6 for tax!!! I should have looked twice before agreeing to it and even gave her a tip but I went home dumbfounded how my meal was supposed to be $11.25 but came out $17.25..... unless places started charging $6 for taxes now, I got scammed today! Yeah not again Blue"}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars for the happy hour menu and price.

If A Night at the Roxbury slept with Sushi, you would get Blue Wasabi. The music, the people, and the employees all seem like they have been unfortunately misplaced from Scottsdale. But it didn't really seem over the top - it just seemed trendy and didn't bother me.

I've been here twice and each time I've loved the food I ordered. And let me repeat, the happy hour prices (50% off) cannot be beat - especially for the portion sizes that are brought out.

My favorites are the Squid Salad, the Yo Adrian (Cream cheese, krab, green onion, smoked salmon and chopped dill on top), and the Crab Wontons - a fillng, delicious meal! 

The Eating Nemo is also worth a try...(Krab, cucumbers, salmon, sliced lemon and something called ponzu sauce)...next time i'm here I want to try the CHUCK NORRIS.

And this is actually one of the few places that I have found to have a Happy Hour on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"This use to be the best sushi in town. Not anymore. It's so disappointing that we drove from Sedona and this was our first stop to receive dry, bland and flavorless sushi. Should had looked at the reviews."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today, coincidentally during happy hour (between 4-6pm Mondays through Sundays). A huge chunk of the menu was 50% off so we ordered some nigiri and a ton of rolls. 

The rolls were above average, they're good if you want to get some unique rolls (not like the generic rolls that you usually get in sushi restaurants.) for a very decent price. I was a little put off by the blue-ness of their wasabi, but the nigiri made it worth it. It was BY FAR THE BEST nigiri I've ever had in AZ, and it's all I'll be ordering next time I go there."}
{"text":"As a first timer; Great place. Beautiful set up. Awesome food! Friendly employees and owners. Waiter was attentive but as soon as it got busy he didn't check on us as much. 

I get the \"blue wasabi\" they give you is suppose to be their \"signature\" thing for the restaurant but it's very unappealing. It looks like something you don't want to eat. 

Happy Hour prices for the drinks were not bad but the prices for food was $$$ for Happy Hour. Nothing happy about that. 

The \"Me Soy Horny\" roll is the best! Definitely my fav!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour!

If you like half priced sushi rolls and martinis, you cannot beat this happy hour.  They even have happy hour on Saturday.  The atmosphere is great, the service is good and prices are awesome."}
{"text":"On Saturdays my family always likes to get together to eat and hang out. Sometimes we make food, sometimes we go out. This time, my sister and brother in law suggested we take the fam to Blue Wasabi for happy hour. It was my first time in a sushi bar, and it did not disappoint. We ordered a whole bunch of rolls to share, and all were fabulous! The kids got pizza rolls, chicken skewers, and crab stuffed wontons, and they enjoyed playing with chopsticks. There was only one dish we tried that I wasn't quite a fan of. It was called Mongolian Beef, and had pieces of bamboo in it. It smelled terrible and tasted just as bad. My nephew even told me that it smelled like garbage. However, to each their own. The staff was very nice and patient with us sushi newbies and the mixed drinks were good too! I highly recommend going at Happy Hour when everything is cheaper!"}
{"text":"Showed up with no reservations on a Saturday night and still got seated.  A few of the people I was with were no sushi eaters, and they were very happy with the non sushi options they had.  As for me, I loved there house specialty rolls...try the Tropic Thunder!"}
{"text":"After eating here so many times, I thought I'd finally do a review on it.  The first thing you notice when you walk in Blue Wasabi is: this place is hip and cool.  With its contemporary design and chic atmosphere, you know this is the place to be on a Friday night.  And the blue chairs and other blue accessories keeps with the theme.  The best part about this place is that there's Happy Hour (HH) everyday and I would only come here when it's HH.  Half off on certain drinks, rolls and sushi, it's no wonder it'll get crowded during the HH time.  

What's this place know for is their blue wasabi just like the name of the restaurant.  It takes just like regular wasabi but colored blue which makes this different.  After trying pretty much all their HH menu, I would have to say my favorites are Killer Bee and the seared Ahi tuna salad dishes.  Killer Bee is great for those who love unagi.  The eels are so fresh and very tasty.  The subtle sweet taste of the sauce and the mango is sure to sting your taste buds.  This is a great twist from the traditional California roll.  What I love about the tuna salad is its many fresh tuna.  They are very generous on the tuna.  And the tangy vinaigrette adds a nice kick to the dish.   The salad is great for sharing, but it can be a pretty good meal by itself.

The desserts are a twist to the traditional main course.  They don't have your simple green tea ice cream or other Japanese desserts.  But they replace it w/ sweet chocolate rolls, banana spring rolls and tempera apples.  

On top of it all, they have creative names for their rolls that make this sushi place unlike the other sushi places you've ever been.  Its unique flavors and clever food twists make this place makes you want to eat and play with your food. Good eats + good fun = successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  During happy hour they have many martinis half price and great deals on both small plates and Sushi. The Milky Way Martini is awesome! Also, if you wear blue on Sunday alcohol is half price."}
{"text":"We went to Blue Wasabi for dinner on Saturday. The place was packed, but it didn't affect the friendliness and the service. They have a huge TV in the middle of the restaurant, which can be watched from either side. Great for peeps who want to check out a game or something. 

We tried TONS of sushi and a few drinks. The drinks were SO good and there were a couple GREAT sushi standouts. They're really creative with the sushi at Blue Wasabi, so I think it's best to try their different rolls, rather than sticking to the small amount of traditional sushi they offer. 

I don't remember all the funny names, but I'll describe what we got :) 

1. edamame - cooked well and decent amount of salt
2. beef sushi that was dipped in battered and fried - mildest/interesting (in a good way) flavor of all. 
3. soft shell crab sushi - 2nd favorite of the night
4. calamari sushi - good flavor and the calamari was cooked perfectly
5. special roll with seafood on top - favorite of the night
6. the standard california roll - fresh and good

Drinks:
Muai Wowie - fruity and tasty
Wango Mango - fruity and tasty
Milky Way - who doesn't want a chocolatey drink with a caramel rim? SO dangerously good

So, if you want a lively atmosphere with friendly waiters/hostesses and  really creative sushi and some drinks, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place service is always amazing and the sushi is the best! But if you're looking for a quiet place this isn't the place for you it is noisy but it's fun!"}
{"text":"This place has great food but horrible service! My martini was room temp! The waitress failed to tell me that it wasn't happy hour on Mondays! So after I ordered 65.00 worth of sushi, thinking it would be half off and then to find out nope! Not the case! Then when I called to complain to the manger all he said was sorry it's our policy not to tell it's not happy hour. Huh ? Oh well they lost my business! My family and I will never go back! Now time to find a new sushi place !"}
{"text":"I visited Blue Wasabi after a recommendation from a coworker. I have tried other sushi places, but after living in the Pacific Northwest for ten years I acquired a good taste for sushi. Yes, I gave it five stars and yes, it is that good. The best sushi I've had in Arizona and better than most places in the northwest. If course we had drinks and they were also excellent!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, average sushi but amazing cocktails.  No amount of alcohol could ever make me patronize this place again.  

Last Wednesday my son ordered some sushi to go, he ordered what he thought was single rolls.  They did not give him a total or review his order with him on the phone. Upon arriving to pick up he was shocked to find SIX boxes of sushi with his name on it.  He said he didn't order that and the cashier advised this was his order and showed him the ticket.  He explained what he wanted and asked them to amend the order, they refused.  A person who said they were the manager came to help at his request and he too refused to amend the order.  My son advised he would not be paying and tried to leave.  They told him they would call the police for 'theft' and that they made the order so he needed to pay for it.  He tried calling his parents but it was after ten and these old folks were fast asleep.  He again tried to leave and the manager and another employee were waiting for him on the patio and again told him they were going to call the police for 'theft'. He again tried to get them to take off some of the sushi (he was not trying to leave with this order, he was just trying to fix the amount or leave w/o any food) and they told him again, we made it so you have to pay full price.  That price? $177.00.  My twenty year old son who looks 16 and makes just a tad more than minimum wage and lives on his own paid this bill.  It was the night before thanksgiving, he did not want to spend any time in jail.  They played on his fear of the police arresting him for ordering too much food and bullied him into paying a bill that would pay for two months worth of groceries for him.  Not only am i disgusted with their complete lack of customer service but I am appalled they would bully a young adult into paying for something he did not order and for their mistake.  Had they told him his total over the phone it could have been cleared up then and there.  The restaurant and management have made no attempt to rectify this situation. Apparently they are pretty hard up for business if they had to strong arm and lie to someone for $177."}
{"text":"Great mixed drinks. Great small plates to share. The pork and shrimp small plates were really delicious and flavorful. Sushi was top quality and the rolls were innovative and tasty. Such a wide selection that we will be trying new stuff every time we go back. Hipster kind if vibe and actual blue wasabi, which seems kitchy, but everything was great."}
{"text":"Definitely go at happy hour between 4-6 you can get 5 rolls for the price of 3. They have a pretty good happy hour menu with these as a few of my favorites 
Gecko 
Chuck Norris 
Shrimp Biskit 
Yea their menu is pretty fun. I'd definitely make this one of your step out of your box and try."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars.  Some guy, (who a friend told me is the owner,) interrupted a conversation I was having with the manager, making excuses for poor customer service.  Then reacted like a sad excuse for Gordon Ramsey, when I automatically said,\"Bullshit.\" I was advised I'm \"Not welcome\" there again, and am shedding no tears for lackluster food, drinks, and yesterday's service."}
{"text":"The one thing I enjoy about the trendier sushi places is that they have a soy paper alternative to seaweed. I cannot handle the seaweed! That being said I admit I am NO sushi aficionado by any means. I like the fact they offer some \"chicken sushi rolls\" for those that don't do fish period. The fun names and colorful rolls add to the experience. Every time I have been I was pregnant so I was unable to sample the drinks but my friends all seem to thoroughly enjoy them. They have a great happy hour m-s 4-7 with several of their rolls half off and a fair amount of drinks priced at $5. If you are a definite sushi lover and looking for something truly authentic this is probably not the place for you. If you enjoy a funky/trendy atmosphere with a good happy hour and fun sushi give it a shot! I must say, I like this place better than Ra."}
{"text":"I am no means a Sushi expert, so those of you who are \"in the know\" may have keen senses to know what's really good or not so good. But for me, it has always been a good experience and Blue Wasabi warrants my return.
I have been here several times and the sushi has always been fresh when I ordered. The bartenders have always been tentative, and the service overall has always been decent.
I dock a star because of price; if you miss happy hour then the bill for two or more people can get rather high. When I want to get sushi, I opt for Blue Wasabi rather than RA Sushi."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time going to Blue Wasabi, although it's been 3 years since the last.  I actually went there with a group of business associates and when I had called to reserve a table for 10 I was told that I couldn't reserve one.  I showed up about an hour earlier than my coworkers in order to save a table and informed the hostesses that the rest of my party would be about an hour.  They did not have a problem with it and quickly sat me.  About an hour later the manager came up to me and told me, very rudely, that I'd been there for an hour and a half (actually, it was just one hour) and that my party would need to show up soon or he'd have to give my table away.  He acted like I had planned it this way and had not informed the hostesses, which is not what happened.  Five minutes later my party started arriving but the manager chose to seat part of my table anyway with another party.  He was beyond rude and condescending.  I'm with a medical practice, the group I was meeting with are all surgeons and doctors.  It's difficult for us to show up at a scheduled time because surgeries sometimes go longer than expected.  We had hoped to make it in time for happy hour and in fact, everybody did, but the waiter did not take their orders on time so they missed the happy hour prices.  I ordered two martinis, a small salad and one of the light entrees, everything but the salad was happy hour price or half price and my bill was $29.  The drinks were weak, but overpriced and the food was very small portions.  This place is way overpriced and not a place I'd ever go to to meet up with friends again.  They seem to care more about getting people in and out as quickly as possible and discourage you from enjoying a meal with friends.  Needless to say none of us will be back."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Martini was not very good. But i didn't complain. So, Why then the attitude from the bartender lady? Some people just look pissed to be serving you, and would rather talk with their bar-backs than interact. Whatever, that is why you are getting 2 stars. Sushi, not that great either. Next time, I'm going to Kona, for, if nothing else, less attitude."}
{"text":"I recently became a huge sushi fan with this place and Ra being my favorites. Blue Wasabi is so different from other sushi joints including Ra in that their rolls are very untraditional but very yummy. I go here quite often and always try to get something new. Here are my personal favs:

Rolls:
Get Clucked (or the clucker as my friends and I like to call it) - Fried chicken and avocado with a sweet chili sauce, does it get any better? Non sushi people will love this roll
Surf and Turf - Fried shrimp with pineapple salsa. Soooo good. Another non sushi persons roll
Dam Jumper - Wrapped in salmon, no rice at all in this roll. Kinda spicy. Different but very good. You might not likie if you are not into raw fish though.
Marco Rolo - Kinda has an italian flavor to it but it is a really nice combo in a roll. Another sushi haters roll
Rainbow roll
California Roll - How could you go wrong?

Side note: Although the PITA roll taste good, it is a difficult roll to pick up with chopstix without it falling apart. So if you are not good with stix, you might not wanna get this one.

Martini's:
Lemon Raspberry Ice - The best Martini I have had here
Grape Escape - Taste like Grape Coolaid with a kick!
Key West Martini - A good dessert drink. Creamy and taste like key lime pie. I love the graham cracker crumbs around the rim

Other food:
Fried Pizza rolls - These are surprisingly good. A good choice for kids (even though I really dont think you should bring kids to any restaurant). 
Pork Pot stickers
Buddha Burgers - The meat in these tastes like quality beef, almost as good as Kobe beef. Not sure what kind of meat it was. The sweet potato fries are awesome!

To sum it up, this place has alot of options for everyone. If you are not a sushi lover, you can still have sushi rolls that you will probably like. A little tip: if you hate seaweed which is in most rolls, you can substitute it with rice paper. The service has always been good every time I have gone here. The price is a little high though not any higher than I have seen at other sushi places included Ra. Try this place, you will love it!"}
{"text":"One kid, two girls, three rolls, four drinks...JK no drinks for us (we are more responsible drivers/parents than that) but not gonna lie those cocktails were calling my name.  While the vibe is more bar/date night than family dining, they do have half booths and a few kid safe menu options.

Roll one, the tropical thunder, a spicy panko breaded shrimp with spicy krab and avocado topped with shrimp and pineapple salsa.  The roll was definitely spicy, the salsa is the unexpected element that cools it down and sweetens it up, loved it. 

Roll two, red hot chili pepper, spicy tuna roll topped with sashimi sliced tuna and a spicy chili aioli.  It was not nearly as spicy as the name suggests, which was a little disappointing one the spicy meter.

We probably saved the best for last.  For our final roll, we did Chuck Norris, no pun intended.  If Chuck Norris were to eat sushi, he would poop out Pat Morita.  And if Chuck Norris where to be a sushi, he would be a spicy salmon and panko crusted shrimp inside, topped with sashimi salmon, avocado, fresh squeezed lemon juice and togarashi.  And he would be delectable."}
{"text":"Meh, I'm just not a fan unless a friend drags me here. The atmosphere is just a little too sterile for me, foods ok, beer choices are just ok. I'm not a fan of martinis but their martini menu looks great. Servers are usually awkward unless you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Another date night means saketini night.

My hubby and I did not even make the 3pm-6pm Happy Hours.  I hate when I get the full bill when it should've been 1/2 off!  

I ordered the Berry and Buttah Face saketini.  The Japanese tongue-like berry felt like you're french kissing it.  I can't explain what the taste is like, but the drink had a fresh fruity taste.  Hubby is DD, yet again.

We ordered spider, Philadelphia, rainbow and salmon rolls.  The wasabi is blue, thus the name of the restaurant.  I don't really like the synthetic blue dye...oh well.  Butterfish, scallops, and yellowtail sashimi were excellent.  Mind you it's fusion and not traditional.  Some had a lemon gingery sauce, while others were soy based.  

Great place to have a girl's night out, too!   Definitely a great place to have your sushi fix!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to go for sushi and drinks! The food is so good here and the rolls are unique and well put together flavor wise. The fish is ALWAYS fresh which I am extremely particular with. I have been a pretty big sushi eater for years and finally we have something in Arizona which happens to be close to home where everything is fresh and always great! 

Another perk is they have Happy Hour on Saturday even! The service is excellent and all of the staff are friendly and welcoming! The overall vibe of this place very cool. A great place for a date, dinner with friends and even family's! Absolutely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Has the best sashimi. Try the salmon carpaccio sashimi.  The Tomb Stone roll is another favorite."}
{"text":"The sushi doesn't seem as flavorful and fresh as expected. Inside is a little cramped with the center bar area being too large to yell to friends on the opposite side. The happy hour food was meh but they sure don't skimp on the sake! I'd say better places for sushi and atmosphere."}
{"text":"First visit here was a few months back and really enjoyed it - great food, drinks, service.  Last night's visit complete opposite.  I asked for a table outside - there were two tables right outside the door that were open.  The hostess didn't seat me there, she instructed her helper to take me to a table way down in the back, behind a brick wall (all other tables were behind a metal fence, with heaters nearby) to a table all by itself.  The area was the outside service area - extra chairs, propane tanks for heaters (though no heater by my table), garbage, you name it.  I should have asked for another table.  The next two couples into the restaurant were sat at the two open tables, so perhaps the hostess didn't want to give a single diner a prime table.  Strike one.  My server was pleasant, seemed fairly new.  I didn't want to punish her for the table I was given (I was the only table she had outside) so I ordered my drink.  I specified Chopin vodka for my drink.  Judging by the headache I have today, they didn't use Chopin in my drink. (It is the only vodka on the market that I do not suffer headaches from.)  The menu states Chopin vodka is an $8.00 premium, yet my drink cost me $10.00.   Strike two.  The sushi I ordered was great - kudos to the chef.  

Strike three would have to be the server presuming I was finished just because I asked for a box for my left over sushi.  It's a terrible trend I notice at restaurants as of late.  Good servers allows diners to finish their meal before asking if they are considering dessert. I can say this as I have worked as a server.   More often than not I am asked if I want dessert while still in the middle of my entree.  In this case, I was not asked if I wanted dessert, she brought the check with the box.  I would have ordered dessert (which is why I did not finish my entire entree) had been given the opportunity.  Instead, servers these days seem to be in a hurry to get rid of patrons when they, the server decides the meal is over.  It would have added to the bill and her tip.  

I don't know if I will give this place another visit as there are so many sushi restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"It seems the service keeps getting worse here. Sushi is decent but we won't be coming back. No refills on water, brought the wrong food, unorganized staff, half the heat lamps couldn't be used outside because they didn't have propane. Etc. Very poorly run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with my wife and kids. We ordered a little bit of everything. And all of it was on point. The fish was very fresh and the staff were on it. From the moment we sat down we were taken care of. I want to thank the manger and staff for their great service. Also bonus, they made my wife her favorite roll from our old sushi place. A custom chicken roll. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time visit, we happened to conveniently come during Happy Hour.   Sushi was very fresh and an excellent variety.  Some of our favorites were Shrimp Bizkit, Gordon Gecko, Chuck Norris and Go Adrian.  The martinis are a must.   Berry White, Mowie Wowie, and Magic Mike are all worth trying.   The toasted coconut sprinkled on the Magic Mike was awesome.  Service was top notched and very prompt.   Overall great experience and a great way to relax after shopping all day in SanTan Village."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is, hands down, the best sushi restaurant I've ever encountered. They have fresh, high quality ingredients and truly care about the work they produce. Everything from the eye-catching martinis to the innovative sushi rolls have been artistically thought out to deliver a unique taste that can't be found anywhere else (trust me, I've looked!).

The menu is big, but not overwhelming, and great for all types of eaters: gluten-free, vegetarian, non-sushi, new sushi, sushi snob (like myself). If you're not sure where to start, just ask your server. Everyone has been great and super eager to tell you their favorites!

**My must-try list is Rock Shrimp, Spicy Salmon Poke, and the Dam Jumper (not pictured)**"}
{"text":"Our first experience in Arizona for sushi and I was absolutely pleased.  My son and I had ordered the California Roll and Spider Roll and the blue wasabi was a different twist on the flavor as well as the color.  It was not like the green wasabi which can clear nasal passages.  We also had the fried apple desert and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The spicy tuna sushi was fishy 
Loved the look of the place big screens to watch sports. It's very loud inside. Nice heaters outside. 
Very clean . Great staff..."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour prices and menu.  Seth and Manager did a great job working with a cranky, nonsushi loving 5 year old!  We all left happy and full!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were excellent!! My favorite was the crab wontons, the apple dipping sauce was so good! They were quick to take our order and deliver. The only thing stoping me from giving a 5 star rating is we are still sitting here 25 mins after finishing eating and we still don't have the bill. I think they forgot about us :(

So it turns out they did indeed forget about us. However they were so apologetic and completely comped our meals, which was more then we ever expected. For that I change my review to 5 stars. If that is not customer service I don't know what is."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. Sit at the bar, enjoy a Berry White martini and spicy edamame.  This is a staple place for me and friends, never had a bad roll. Worth the price! Dam Jumper is my all time favorite!"}
{"text":"Such terrible service. We have come to Blue Wasabi for 3 girls' nights. On the first 2 nights, we have been treated well by the staff until it approaches closing time. Once it comes close to closing time, the staff becomes exceptionally hostile and rude in their unsubtle hints to tell us that it's time to go home. Tonight, the obnoxious hints started 1 1/2 hours before closing time: glares, staring, rude remarks. We asked to speak to the manager about it, and he laid into us about how they should go home early. How ridiculous! We will definitely be choosing other places for girls' night in the future. I'm guessing this is why they are dead at night."}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled with the sushi selection. We tried three rolls and would give all maybe a 4/10... We went to Rah Sushi last week and were treated to some of the best sushi I've ever had (for the same price as this place), so maybe my standards were set a little high... Also a little crowded with seating.. I love my ginger but theirs seemed like it was left over from a previous week... My favorite part of the experience was my wife asking the waitress to repeat the specialty roll named \"Me Soy Horny\".  Hahaha."}
{"text":"Went her for Ladies Night and loved it. Great drinks! The small plates were fabulous and our server was awesome and made some great suggestions."}
{"text":"We came over here as our second choice and now know it should have been our first choice. We enjoyed 2 delicious martinis,  yummy sushi, great orange chicken and attentive service. They seated us outside as we requested with nearly no wait time. Pleasant experience.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for a first date and it was really good sushi and the service was great. However it was really pricey since we both got drinks. While I was there I asked about their happy hour specials. I went back during happy hour and was very satisfied by the food, service and price. My martini was amazing and I suggest the Marilyn Monroll."}
{"text":"I will never go there again. The owner is a jerk and I've never been so disrespected by a business owner before. I won't be going back simply because I dont want to give him any more of my money. Just from sitting at the bar I've seen how poorly he treats his employees as well, as someone coming from the restaurant industry that is simply unacceptable."}
{"text":"Dined for the first time. I'd give the atmosphere and friendly staff 5 stars but the food is alright, its not that great. They put a modern twist to their sushi. The blue wasabi does not taste like wasabi at all. There is no spice to it..too much food coloring.
It could be a decent place for beginners. For authentic sushi lovers, it's not worth it. Not worth it for the price of their sushi and the quality."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the sushi itself is pretty decent.  Sitting outside on the side, not front, is nice.  The service tends to be a little slow and disorganized.  They brought the food out in a very strange order so half of us were always without, party of 6.  We had a good time nonetheless.  The rolls are ok, although I am more of a sashimi and nigiri guy.  The yellowtail sashimi was fresh, nigiris were what you would expect, miso soup could be better.  I had an unfiltered sake that was good.  Overall, not nearly the best sushi or ambiance around but not bad given the location and decent to good sushi."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place during happy hour.  The selection is more limited, of course, but it was a way to try it less expensively.

First, the wasabi really is blue.  I wonder how they did that.  Or, rather, what sort of chemical dyes they used.  Beyond that, it was very weak wasabi.  No heat at all.  The two of us used the entire ball between our bowls of soy sauce.  And then asked for more.  I don't know why it was so weak, but it was.

The sushi rolls we ordered both had cooked shrimp (tempura), which was unique.  The warmth was odd...I'm used to sushi being raw and cold.  They were tasty, but it was still \"different\".

We also ordered two beef dishes (I think they were called Ghengis and Lava).  They were both tasty.

I think I prefer more traditional sushi rolls.  These weren't bad, but I still can't quite get past the warm sushi pieces.  I am glad we came during happy hour, though, as I would not have been happy paying full price for the food we ordered.

Overall, not a bad place.  A bit pricey with several unique items.  I doubt I'll become a regular, but I would not be averse to returning for snacks or if I had some sort of coupon.  But probably not a full meal, and very probably not for full price.  It's not good enough for that."}
{"text":"We went in, a party of 4 on a Sunday... and they had a happy hour going on..  The hostess sat us at one booth.. only for me to see that it had food and sticky liquid all over it. So she tried to seat us elsewhere and same thing! I told her to bring me a rag and I'll clean it myself... and she actually let me! All the seats had food, crumbs, liquid all over them.

And the martinis were ok but they didn't even chill the martini glass!! WTH?! And they call themselves a martini bar?! Oh well...on to the sushi.. We ordered some rolls which were just all way to small to justify the $12 price tag... I won't go into details of what I didn't enjoy about the sushi.. but for this kindda fusion sushi, I think places like RA do it better.

So as we ate the rolls, the dynamite (eh..), salad.. baked shrimp app, martinis.. and waited for our check.. and waited and waited and waited.. we see the Manager just sitting around  the back of the restaurant and not checking tables (OR us) and completely ignoring the tables.. what on earth?! Why would you not check on a table that spends as much money as we just did??

And it's def NOT a place for sushi/sashimi afficionados!

Arg... feel like I wasted money :-("}
{"text":"It's the coolest place close to home.  Love the atmosphere and drinks.  Sushi in Arizona never seems that good to me, but overall I like this place and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"21 Dec 2013

This was my first time going there, and I took my girlfriend around 4:30pm on a Saturday. It was already packed, so I had a good feeling! We got seated immediately since it was just the two of us. We looked at the menu and was surprised to see that they had half off selected sushi for 1/3 of the menu--maybe more.

We ordered a salmon nigiri and seared white tuna nigiri. Hands down these were the best in the area. We also got the Gordon Gecko, Eating Nemo and Chuck Norris rolls. Eating Nemo was a glorified california roll--I wouldn't get it a second time. Gordon Gecko was okay. Chuck Norris tasted like a Doritos. Even though we didn't really like the rolls, all of the fish served was fresh!"}
{"text":"Love Blue Wasabi.  Blue Wasabi was voted best sushi in Gilbert.  They have a great happy hour and it is a great time if you just want to have some drinks and hangout with some friends after work.  If you like traditional sushi this place is not for you.  Blue Wasabi puts a unique twists on their rolls.  There Spicy Rockin' Shrimp Tempura is the best small plate they have.  You get the crunch from the tempura battered shrimp and then you get a hit of the spicy mayo on the back end.  Love it!
As far as rolls go you have to order the Chicken & Waffle Roll.  Yes, I said it Chicken & Waffle Roll.  You get the crunch of the chicken with the sweet maple syrup on the back end.  Mix that with rice and the juicy white meat chicken #mindblown!  Another one they have which is the best that is not on the menu is the Vegas Roll.  This is the best Vegas roll I have ever had...  The Vegas Roll contains smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, dynamite sauce, and is deep fried tempura style.  Anything fried I am sold!  If you have a craving for pounding down some sushi best time to head over is during happy hour and go to town!

{"text":"I've noticed a trend in my reviews. I'll go somewhere once, have an amazing experience then go a 2nd time only to be disappointed. After a stellar first experience, I came back again yesterday to have another stellar experience. The servers are all friendly and great at their jobs (yesterday, we had JJ who was super nice!). I should point out, I'm not a raw sushi gal. I stick to California rolls primarily and anything cooked. It's amazing to me that you can order a California roll at any sushi place but Blue Wasabi's was/is so much better! In theory, it's the same ingredients, right? Well, Blue's is so much better. I don't know how or why, but it is. My daughter got the orange chicken and said it was good but she'd prefer more sauce and maybe a side of rice. But overall, good. I love their crab wontons but don't care for the apple plum sauce. This is where the servers are great because I asked for Thai chili sauce instead and it was brought to me without question.  The flavor of the crab wonton filling is so yummy and I could eat my weight of these things. On my first visit, I also tried the Shrimp Tempura Roll which was fantastic and totally appeals to my soft-crunchy balance quirk in foods. My daughter at that visit, had Spicy Tuna Roll, seaweed salad, and tuna nigiri. Her favorite though was the Chuck Norris Signature roll. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and delicious. I love also that there are options for non-sushi people. Lastly, the Mello Jello martini is ridiculously good. It's like kool-aid and jello with booze but classier than a Jell-O shot. Love!!! I should get a frequent diner rewards because I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The atmosphere is really relaxing and the food is exceptional. The bar tenders and waiting staff are fun to be around. The sushi is great with some unique options. I highly recommend it for a good night out."}
{"text":"I was astounded that there were so many tables available at dinner time on a Saturday...today I think I am learning why. Only ate sushi. Partly my own fault for thinking sushi in the dessert was a good idea. Today I have enjoyed several bottles of pedialite for the 'common' effect associated with food poisoning. And Tylenol to ease the stabbing pains in my gut. Should have listened to my instincts... Called them to let them know what I ate, hoping that I could stop them from poisoning someone else. Manager said he would have another manager call me back.... Never happened. I guess this is a call they are accustomed to getting. 
Needless to say, I will not be going back.

UPDATE****** The owner had an incorrect number for me but was able to contact me through yelp and offered an apology. He also gathered information that could help him in finding out what happened."}
{"text":"Great selection of $5.00 martinis during happy hour.  On date, we had wango mango and lemon raspberry ice martinis.  Both had very good taste but little alcohol.

The krusty krab roll and drunken barbeque shrimp were decent.  A 3.5 stars each.  The spicy yellow tempura mushrooms were like a 2.5-3.0 star.

It's a very loud environment and very hard to hear her because she is not a loud person.  Waiter was very busy handling a lot of tables.  Understaffed.

We had fun here as it is a fun environment.  We might come back for the martinis but not the sushi.  lol.  sushi here is doable."}
{"text":"Ok... Half off alcohol on Sunday = big fat WIN!! I really dug this place for a minute, but tired of it easily. The drinks are good, and there are some inexpensive rolls and apps on HH, but it doesn't satisfy my sushi craving. I still haven't found that magical restaurant that ranks up with my multiple sushi joints in San Diego... Sigh. The search continues..."}
{"text":"I went to Blue Wasabi for the first time today. The martinis were amazing and the food on happy hour was awesome. Ashlee was a great server and made great suggestions for my table."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Their happy hour is unbeatable and the drinks are good. Such a good place to go with the girls for a night out. Also, they have a great sushi selection that includes a number of rolls with NO FISH. That may sound pointless to many of you, but since I am highly allergic, it's refreshing to find a place that I can enjoy with all of my sushi-loving friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, service is on point ! And the sushi is bomb.com. 
Surf and turf is my favorite! 
Also the big daddy as well yum!!!! 
They also have great deals, follow them and you'll see them too ;)"}
{"text":"We love this place. Although it only has 2 tables in the whole restaurant suited for families with small children, we always manage to get one of them. We love going there for happy hour when a lot of items on their menu are half off. Not just appetizers either, rolls and drinks are half off too! The service is always good and the food excellent. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Who knew there would be more sushi restaurants in Phoenix than there are Starbucks in Seattle!  
Plates of pasta and carbo loading for races are totally passe.   The perfect balance of protein and starch was what we were all craving before the PF Chang Rock N Roll Half Marathon.  
Blue Wasabi was solid - the decor was  a little outdated and the drinks kinda fruity and corny, but the service was very friendly and the sushi was very good.  They had several intersting rolls, and the unagi was delicious (a good measure of the quality of a sushi joint, in my opinion)  
We left pleasantly full, but not stuffed, and perfectly satisfied."}
{"text":"I recently visited and while I thought my food was good the service was seriously lacking.Maybe I got the wrong server.I don't know... The server was not very friendly, almost stuck up and snotty.If we were not having such a good time talking, there was a group of us, I am sure I would have been even more annoyed at how slow it was to get  our food out. I know that sushi is not supposed to be a rushed thing, but  over an hour to get 5 dishes out? they brought one about every 15 minutes even though we had ordered our own individual orders.  Sea weed salad and cucumber salad was good."}
{"text":"Got here right after happy hour on a Friday and we were seated immediately. Our server was great and we were able to order pretty quickly. We ordered miso soup that was brought to us and it was really good. When I was half-way done, though, I realized that I was eating from a dirty spoon. Like, dirty. It was in the soup when it arrived and I didn't think to check. I was super grossed out and notified our server, who just said some were stained and brought new spoons. It wasn't stained. I could wipe the food off with my finger. Nasty. But I did not die. I was able to continue eating the ton of other food we had ordered and it was honestly excellent. I'll be back, but I'll definitely be checking to make sure everything is clean prior to sticking it in my mouth omg"}
{"text":"Service was good. Was there at the beginning of happy hour. Food was ok. Had salmon sashimi(really thin and tasted smoky). Two martini's and a cucumber salad (cucumber salad is really simple but there was zero effort with this simple item)..
 I would go elsewhere if you are looking for thick cuts of fresh fish and good ginger. The ginger was really dried out and discolored. Food did come out fast, never waited long for anything, plenty of staff inside."}
{"text":"First time there, wont be back. Service was mediocre to poor, extremely noisy, sushi was good but nothing special. Overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went to  this place for happy hour . We ordered lots of sushi and some appetizers.  The quality was very low, I didn't even eat. The presentation and service was nice, it just seems to me they use cheap fish and sushi looked so dry .  And we spent almost $100 including drinks .I don't think we will ever go back ."}
{"text":"This place is garbage, just another hyped-up trendy Sushi joint that \"tries\" to make up for their lack of quality with a \"hip/modern atmosphere\".  Been there once, will NEVER eat there again. The sushi is not good, the rice in our dish was hard, and the food was way overpriced. Of course, they have the usual airheaded ditzes and douchebags serving you food as if it's hurting them to smile. Don't waste your time with this pathetic attempt of a Sushi bar."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour (get there early, it gets busy). Great selection of 1-of-a-kind Martini's and unique/signature sushi. Staff does a great job, 2nd time I've been here and look forward to coming back many times more."}
{"text":"Brian was truly an AMAZING server. Seriously. Clearly, I know what I'm talking about... I don't eat at home, just dust my appliances. They made me custom spicy scallops... was awesome :) thank you Chris!  Caitlyn was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Tried Blue Wasabi this evening. Arrived around 5pm. The place was half full. After being seated we waited for 10 minutes as the wait staff ignored us. We got up and left without ever having a waitress or the hostess say a word and went to The Keg. I feel that we owe a thanks to the poorly managed staff because we had a great meal at The Keg. This would have been our fourth time at Blue Wasabi. The first two were actually good, while the last two were disappointing. No need to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. Love the dirty marini with almond-stuffed olives, and the tuna toro. Fast, friendly service during a busy time too."}
{"text":"So after chips,salsa and beer by the pool to celebrate Cinco De Mayo we all found ourselves somehow craving sushi for dinner :) We were a party of 6 so it seemed like by the time we all ordered there was one of everything on the table, all verrry good. We were sat quickly,got awesome service and all of the food was absolutely delicious. The wife and I ordered mostly Nigiri which was spot on. You can't really go wrong with Sake bombers (in my opinion) and those were excellent too. Fun place for dinner on a Saturday night but after reading the other reviews I'll have to check out their happy hour even sooner :) Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The owner personally came to our table and chatted with me and three of my friends. We had awesome service, stellar food (Wango Mango Roll = Heaven) and even better drinks (get the Barry White martini - yum!).

Snag a table on the patio this time of year and enjoy the weather with friends!"}
{"text":"sushi was mediocre, but way expensive for what you get. a little too trendy/annoying. plenty of other sushi places with better food and less about image-conscious patrons."}
{"text":"Ok during non-rush times.  Way too loud during happy hour and evening!

Always enjoyed sushi and drinks with friends and family.  A variety of unusual kinds of sushi... not all the names are family friendly if you know what I mean. Also, be aware of days closed... have been disappointed coming on day closed. 

Be prepared to walk a bit when parking.  Servers are hit and miss.

Cost wise I'd put this at $$$"}
{"text":"Best fresh tasty sushi I've ever had!!!! Must try their salmon carpaccio!!!! Great and friendly service and a lots of fun you can have there again excellent food and atmosphere!!!!! Chicken wings to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay here's what happened...I walk into the restaurant around 3pm and the very friendly hostess, seeing that it's just two of us, asks if we wanted to just sit at the bar. My friend does all the talking and soon we are sitting at the bar. This is when my first experience went to the crapper. 

The bar tender was the worst server I've had in a while. When we first sat down she was so pushy about the drink menu kept pointedly asking what we would like to order - when we finally just asked for water she basically ignored us the rest of the time except to drop off our menus for our food. We didn't get our water until maybe 10 minutes after sitting there and we never got a refill. In fact after she took our orders - with the most disgusted look I'd ever seen - she didn't stop by after that to check up or to see if the food was good. When we were finally served our sushi (she didn't bring it to us) we were missing a whole order but she never stopped long enough for us to explain to her. 

What I don't understand is how she stayed so busy because let me tell you, there was NO ONE at the bar. We finally had to flag her down for our check and even asked to get more water after we got our check. I realize that we were sitting at the bar and so I'm sure she was bummed that our tab wasn't going to be as high since we only ordered water. But you get paid on service and I am still mad that she was tipped at all. She was a nasty doofis, with a muffin top and saggy boobs and if she ever wants to make enough off tips to buy support bras she's gonna need to attend a few more customer service oriented classes. 

Food wise I was not impressed with this place at all. Is the seaweed supposed to be slimy? I will definitely give sushi another try, but I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I'm no sushi connoisseur, but everything I've had here has always been really good!  Happy hour is great....select food and drink items for half price...and it's in the whole restaurant.  Great service, fun atmosphere!  We will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"So fantastic!! The Chernobyl beef is SUPER SPICY AND DELICIOUS!! Service was quick and very pleasant. The bartender recommended a wonderful martini for ladies night(1/2 off Martinis)...an Orange Julius :D all in all, a wonderful experience and great cuisine!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with a friend. Really attentive bar staff and no waiting for food. They did ignore our request for all the food to be served at the same time, but since I put myself through college being a server, that is definitely something my review will overlook.  The parking is a little sparse at happy hour time, and the older gentleman sitting next to me fell over backwards trying to release himself from the heavy and tall bar chairs.  Maybe I should give five stars but, maybe there is just a TINY percentage that could be improved upon at this place."}
{"text":"I loved blue wasabi and have been going for over a year... I recently went back after not going for a month or so and it was so different. The rolls did not taste as good and the miso soup was completely changed. It was a dull flavorless soup. Pretty disappointed since I loved that place for so long!"}
{"text":"Good Place. Cool seating arrangement (very family style). Happy Hour is a good value. Skyy Vodka drinks are like $4 each. Good value. Food was just above average. Not a Sushi guy, so I had the chicken, it was good, not great. Cool pre-spot maybe before the movies?"}
{"text":"Meh... Just really watery martinis and poorly constructed sushi. Having paid an astronomical amount for very little food I left feeling guilty & ashamed that I let the hip veneer and cool vibe draw me in.   I live nearby and am disappointed that I don't have a stellar sushi spot in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I love stopping by during the week for a quick bite.  The food is great and the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi and never really wanted to try it, but after I had eaten here I'm a huge fan. The sushi was amazing and everything tasted great. The price is a little much but it is totally worth it. The atmosphere is good and the place is totally clean. Everyone is super friendly. Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow, the wasabi really is BLUE!!  Enhance the name, however it didn't dawn on me until presented at the table.  What a rather interesting and fun experience.  

Their signature menu is filled with fun and ingenious names.  The happy hour is well priced and worth the ambiance.  We had a couple of yellowfin and salmon nigiris, in addition to the Me Soy Horny, Eating Nemo and Krusty Krab Rolls.   The nigiris were actually quite fresh tasting, however the rolls were mediocre.  I thought the usage of Jasmine rice didn't blend well and the texture was too rough to compliment the sushi.  I'd have to say I had better, but it was not bad at all (sorry, I've had great sushi before).  It was the first time I had \"soy\" wrappers instead of seaweed and I found it to be rather pleasant.  Almost like a tofu skin wrapper.

I liked the ambiance with cool and dark blues, low bar tables and hanging lamps.  Sleek, hip and modern.  The service was surprisingly courteous and the crowd varied from professionals to couples to groupies and families.  It all blended well somehow with the perfect amount of noise and light filtration.

Will definitely go back again if not for the food, then for the decent prices during happy hour and the atmosphere.  Maybe I'll get a martini this time around."}
{"text":"Quite easily the best sushi in town. Worth every dollar every time we go here. I'd highly recommend this place. Great first date and every other date night place too."}
{"text":"Pretty average place, nothing especial. First things first, sat down to 2 nasty glasses. 1 of them had lip stick still on the edge of the glass. Took a quick look around and there wasn't a water glass clean in the whole place. Then my daughter set her arm down on the table and found she put her arm down into something slimy. We were just about to get up and walk out but the waiter showed up and we decided to suck it up and see if they could redeem their selves. 
Our starters were the spicy edamame and squid salad. The waiter recommended putting the spicy edamame sauce on the side so we did. It was just a chili paste so no points for unique but the taste/heat was decent. I enjoyed the squid salad. 
Main dishes consisted of a California roll, Catapillar & their newest super ridiculously hot roll. The California was the basic traditionally, the Catapillar was as well and it really wasn't too special. There was hardly any eel in it. Now the super hot spicy roll that I can't remember the name of was actually pretty delicious. Had habanero and ghost chili aioli on it. 
For dessert we had that banana foster egg roll set up. It was good and it was needed to put out that little bit of heat on the back of the roof of your mouth.

All in all, this place could really work on its cleanliness. The rolls are average in size but not low in pricing so that would be nice if they stepped it up a bit. The new super spicy roll was a nice touch to the menu. The reason this place didn't get a fat 2 stars is because our waiter Jeremy was actually on point"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place and always try to go on Sunday's when we can...there's just no beating 1/2 priced drinks and specialty martinis mixed with great food. Love the food, love the service (Jim the owner is great!), the atmosphere, everything. And always sit at the bar! The bartenders are always friendly and willing to (if you make nice) send some martini samples your way ;) 
You can't go wrong with the Tropical Thunder roll (my favorite), the Gordon Gecko, the pizza rolls (seriously don't skip these, they are not your typical pizza apps, and the Milky Way martini is amazing!"}
{"text":"First of all, I thought it was pretty cool that this place actually did have blue wasabi. I went in a group of 6 for happy hour...the rolls and drinks were half off. The sushi was OK, but nothing special. They are also pre-made so you can't order the rolls to fit your liking which for me is important because I dont like crab, and many rolls contain that ingredient.  The service was not very good, but to give our waitress some credit it was crowded and she seemed pretty busy."}
{"text":"I went here with my brother's fiancé, and brought my dog to enjoy the beautiful weather. Skyler was our server. She was able to recommend the Badda Bing rolls, and I added avocado. They were delicious! Excellent recommendation! My friend got the Dam Jumper and was thoroughly impressed with her dinner as well. 
While we waited for the rolls, we shared a Buttaface. It was nice to enjoy a little dessert before dinner, occasionally. Britney brought us our meals and was an absolute pleasure. She got a laugh out of us asking why the Wasabi was blue!

All in all, it was a relaxing dinner with delicious food and great company. I'll definitely recommend this to my friends and ensure that Skyler takes care of us every time."}
{"text":"The food was decent. The drinks were good, but definitely juiced down(which is more flavorful than watered-down). I felt the price was a bit high for microwaved edamame and machine pressed rolls. I get the food colored blue wasabi, but it would be far better without the food coloring for taste- and where was the spice? Wasabi with no kick is like a broken pencil- no point! The atmosphere got loud quickly though not inappropriately. 
No tea?
Here's a quick rule of thumb- if a Japanese restaurant has no Japanese employees, expect American food. 
Overall, okay. I would return, but with far different expectations. As much as I love wasabi, I will be passing on it next time."}
{"text":"I went to Blue Wasabi yesterday for Happy Hour and had the Salmon salad, beef and brocoli and the tempura. 
 I got food poisoning and spent the evening throwing up. 
 When I called the restaurant to let them know, the hostess told me there is adisclaimer on their menu, and its ays raw food can cause food poisoning... Charming!!
 When I said she could continue the conversation with my lawyer, she called the manager who apologised, told me he was going to make a note, check the kitchen and keep an eye on it. He was bidding hios fareweels when I said I wanted my money refunded.
 - Ohhh... I can't do that. You need to talk to the owner.

WOW!! I am not asking to be compensated for the inconvenience. I am not asking them to pay for my meds. Or the time I wasted being sick after eating their food,

All I asked was not to be charged for the food that made me sick. And I could not get a straight answer... I am NOT IMPRESSED."}
{"text":"The \"happy hour\" portions on the sushi gets smaller and smaller everytime when come to this place.  The service sucks, had to call out for someone come to our table after being set for 15 minutes. The salmon on my and my wife's roll had salmon, and the edges was actually brown instead of pink.  The salmon was going bad.  DONE!  Will not come back to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is what got me hooked onto sushi. I was never a very big fan of sushi until I came here. The food was amazing and super fresh. Their happy hour menu is pretty awesome too. Although, their sushi is a little bit more expensive than other places (you do get what you paid for here). It's expensive but their sushi is amazing."}
{"text":"I went to the sushi making class held once a month. When I first arrived there wasn't a lot of people but that soon changed. It was fully packed when it started. It took about 2 to 3 hours to learn how to make the sushi. 

Some guy next to me kept harassing me that I was going to cut my finger. But that was funny.

The rolls they had us make were not fresh ingredients. It looked like they were just trying to pawn off on us yesterdays groove. Which makes for a good marketing campaign and gets rid of old food.

\"Hey how do we cut our costs of all the old food we have to throw away?\", says owner.

\"I gots an idear. Lets have a class and we can use all the ingredients we didn't sell and charge a lot for it.\", says despondent grunt.

Brilliant idea guys. For the price of the class we should have gotten any two rolls off the menu we wanted. The teacher was a mono tone, tell all, never show twice type of person. He sucked at teaching and should stay in the kitchen. Sorry I never used a knife before. I am an idiot so don't treat me like another top chef.

The bell hop, button down, Forrest Gump looking waiter was so lurpy. He never came out quickly and tried to tell stories to the other couples on the ends of the teaching tables, probably trying to get tip money. I never felt more ignored in my life.

Never go here or anywhere near here."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a friend and had a blast.    Its kind of a funky setting with outside seating, and they make good sushi.    The service was good as well.  

The Tombstone sushi roll is going to keep me coming back here.   It's hot, seriously delicious and awesome.  

Come give it a try!   These guys are doing things right."}
{"text":"This place was way to pricey for me, especially having a \"laid back\" atmosphere.  It is a trendy place and I feel like sucker for giving them my business.  You don't pay top dollar for that kind of atmosphere.  And paying 12 to 14 dollars for a little martini is outrageous.  The food is good, not great.  There are plenty of hole in the wall sushi places that give you great food for what you pay for."}
{"text":"I'll try to keep it short, sweet, and to the point. Went there for industry night and had a terrible experience. The restaurant closes at 10pm. At 9:15 they did a last call. We got there at 9. When they did a last call about 45 minutes early I asked our waitress what time they close tonight. She confirmed 10pm but that they wanted to close early because no one was in the restaurant except us. They turned off all the tv's, turned on the lights, and closed the restaurant all while we tried to scarf down our food. It's so uncomfortable to be in a restaurant with staff members who look at you like you are a huge inconvenience. First of all the restaurants hours are posted as 10pm. Second of all its just plain rude. The sushi was expensive for what you got and their signature rolls were nothing to brag about. The nigiri was not fresh and was smaller portioned then other sushi restaurants I have been to. There are much better options for sushi out there."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for date night! Happy hour is 4- 6 and the martinis are very tasty - it's easy to get carried away. The servers are great and super helpful. The Chuck Norris and Taylor Swift are our favorites!"}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi definitely gets a one thumb up  from the nice inside decor ( the blue chairs add a really nice touch and play within their name) to the staff and food great great great. Stephen was my waiter, he was a great waiter that paid attention, came when needed and never was a bother. There was not a wait although I did come during their 4 PM happy hour. As I was leaving around 6 PM the restaurant started to get crowded and over the hostess say there was a 45 min wait, mind you this was a Saturday. My wife and I ordered the crab wantons for an appetizer and later order 4 different sushi dishes l, which were all delightful. Overall everything was great besides the one little hiccup of when I order a glass of wine, the rim of my glass had dried up red lip stick, this is a big no no. Stephen was really nice about it quickly got me another drink. 4 stars and 1 thumb up is good enough for me definitely will go back when the wife and I want cheap happy hour drinks and great sushi."}
{"text":"Got there right before happy hour. Our waiter was awesome and he gave us explanations on all we asked for. Drinks were great, however the dishes lacked proper washing. The waiter was cool about it and replaced the wine glass with the lipstick stain with great empathy. Food was great and loved the decor."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is legit!! My friends and I got here on a Fri around 430 and it was packed already, we waited about 15 minutes for a table. The happy hour sushi specials are really good & everything we had was delicious. The only weird thing to me was that the regular sushi wasn't on HH- $6.50 for a California roll during HH is a bit steep in my opinion. Also, they have good drinks (pom pom!) and wines. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Poor management. We had a table of 6 and went specifically on Monday which is industry night because they give other people in the restaurant industry a 50% discount. The server told us we were good when we mentioned that 3 out of 6 were in the industry and he told us that we could have two people on each tab and still get the discount. So we get our bill and two of us showed very little proof to the manager that we were in the industry and got the discount. The 3rd person in the industry had more proof then anyone and the manager refused to give him the discount. The server should have told us what was required before we ordered. Had we known we wouldn't have gotten the discount we would have gone elsewhere. Even after we told the manager that the server didn't inform us of what was needed he still said we couldn't get the discount. Poor management over $40 bucks. He just lost 6 regular customers."}
{"text":"We went for a triple date night and it was a great choice. Their happy hour was fantastic (items are noted on the menu which have special, half off, happy hour prices). We stated with a round of saki bombers and edemame - delicious. 

I had the california rolls and macadamia crusted chicken - both were delicious. My boyfriend got 3 plates of rolls and an appetizer... what a champ (picture uploaded). 

Excited to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Update returned and waited 8 minutes and not one server came around to greet us! It was not busy as it was 8:45 at night and we finally left after I filled our water with the container sitting by our table. Very disappointing as this has been our go to sushi place and it seems like every 1/5 time we go we get crappy service or none in this instance.


Normally very good, one of our favorite spots to go on a late night date night. However tonight when we arrived the table was poorly bussed, the menu and napkins had food on them from the previous guests. The sushi was still amazing, but tonight we were disappointed with the lack of quality we are us"}
{"text":"Food is great, however, the portion sizes have been drastically reduced!  Making the food not that great of a deal anymore.  The owner, Jim, is a very rude person, he is cocky, arrogant, not concerned with customer service, and he treats his employees poorly!  I have witness Jim speak rudely to his staff, and he does so right in public. Great that he owns the place, but he needs to make Happy Hour longer, and more days of the week, a rush to go to a 2 hour Happy Hour is insane!  And he has decreased the quantity of food, and it is no longer a good deal.  The way he treats his employees is first and foremost, then the ever decreasing amount of food per order is the second reason we will never be back!"}
{"text":"If you're into restaurant/bars where 30-something women go to hang out after loudly announcing, \"OMG! Sushi and Martini Monday!\" after a rough day at the office, then this your place. Or perhaps if you're into trendy bullshit like trying to look sophisticated while you sip your appletini and eat over-seasoned edamame, then Blue Wasabi is your spot. If you're into a tasty, cool and refreshing glass of water to cure that parched palate, then by all means, check out Blue Wasabi.

But if you're into good sushi, go somewhere else. 

2 stars because my water was good."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour.  Sat at the bar, wonderful service from Skylar our bartender. Answered all our questions and even had the owner Jim stop by to make everything was beyond our expectations. Definitely worth the stop, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Woohoo, it is as good as it gets!  Happy Hour or should I say two happy hours (4-6 p.m.).  As a first time customer, I went with a friend on Thursday and was amazed at the happy hour pricing and the quality of the food.  We had the Dirty Sanchez and the Gordon Gecko and to paraphrase from the movie Wall Street, it was almost to beautiful to eat!  The Dirty Sanchez is melt in your mouth delicious....It was so good we ordered a second.  The Gordon Gecko has jalapeño but don't let that scare you.  It had just the right spice.  Paired with happy hour drinks prices and great service, I cannot wait to go back.  I was dreaming of my return before I even left the place."}
{"text":"Had the Crab wontons and a chuck norris roll. Crab wonton were ok. Skimpy on the fillings. Nothing special. Chuck Norris would be disapointed with his name on the roll. It wasn't Kick A$$. The food was OK. Nothing exciting. I have had better and I have had worse."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite happy hour in Gilbert. I've been here a million times over the past 10 years. I figured it's probably time to review the place on Yelp.

I really like their ambiance, décor and service. My only complaint regarding atmosphere is that sometimes it can get extremely loud inside, but that's dependent on how busy it is and people's voice level. So I don't fault the restaurant for that.

Food... I've tried so many things. I suppose I'll just make a list and give brief descriptions/thoughts.

Chuck Norris Roll- Absolutely love it but I order it without lemon juice. The lemon juice is so overpowering that it ruins the roll for me.

Dam Jumper Roll- So so good. However, not for the faint of heart. This would not be something I'd have a sushi rookie try since there is no rice or seaweed on the outside... It's all seafood. A piece of raw salmon rolled around crab, avocado and cucumber!

Wango Mango Roll- It's okay. Very basic. Reminds me of a California Roll with mango.

Shrimp Bizkit Roll- Not a fan. I don't like how the shrimp tastes on top (usually rubbery and not seasoned) and I don't like the asparagus either.

Me Soy Horny Roll- It's okay, but not one of my favorites. Something about the soy paper is a bit odd to me.

Krusty Krab Roll- I loveeee this one! Probably because it's fried lol! Love the combination of seafood and love the two sauces on the plate for dipping.

Gordon Gecko Roll- Not a huge fan as this always seems very plain/bland to me. There aren't any strong flavor profiles that make me want to eat more of it.

Yo Adrian! Roll- The dill is weird. I don't love it.

Orange Chicken- It's pretty good but not as good as Panda Express. :)

Lava Beef- This is pretty good and pretty spicy! Reminds me somewhat of a Panda Express dish though.

Drunken BBQ Shrimp- I love this shrimp and the sauce it comes in!!!!! My only complaint is that the bread they serve with it is always really hard/crunchy. That makes it hard to soup up the leftover sauce with the bread. :(

Crab Wontons- Our fave. We love these. The apple plum sauce they come with is amazing.

Cajun Seared Tuna Sashimi- My husband loves this and gets it every time we go. The flavor of the sauce is yummy, I'm just not a big fan of sashimi!

In terms of alcohol, my favorite signature drinks are the Agent Orange and the Wango Mango. I also love the Milky Way but it is definitely a drink for dessert! I don't like drinking it with sushi.

Overall, obviously I love some things and dislike others. They have so many items on their happy hour menu that if you go a couple times, you'll find your favorites! :)"}
{"text":"I used to like this place. When I first came here a couple of years ago it was amazing! Delicious drinks, top-notch service and great sushi rolls. The last two times I was here the service was unprofessional, the drinks only so-so, and the sushi mediocre. The prices here are way too high for what this place now offers. I do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"If you seek sushi alone, this place will only be \"ok.\" In my opinion, this place could appeal to a group seeking a light lunch, comprised of sushi lovers, those that don't know if they like sushi, or those that do not like it at all. The menu has a nice variety of rolls that stray from the traditional \"raw\" the sushi lover would typically seek.

But therein lies the appeal. Kids, sushi \"fearers,\" seniors, etc - can get a roll that will make them feel like they actually tried sushi - or they can opt for \"bar food\" of wings, pizza rolls, sliders, chicken strips, etc. 

Which brings me to the downside. Nothing here will be memorable. Only \"ok.\" But sometimes OK is good enough. When it is and you're nearby, this is an OK choice."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did...

The sushi was... not impressive. Only one (Yo Adrian) out of the four happy hour sushi rolls I ordered was decent.

Chuck Norris
Spicy salmon and panko crusted shrimp inside, topped with sashimi salmon, avocado, fresh squeezed lemon juice and togarashi.
My complaint: WAY too much togarashi. It overpowers everything else and it was the only thing I could taste. 1/5

Krusty Krab
Spicy tuna, avocado and krab, tempura'd and served over a spicy aioli drizzle. 
My complaint: This is all tuna with very little crab. I would have enjoyed this more if it was a more even mix. I also don't think they use sriracha mayo for their spicy mix which I think could improve this roll. 2/5

Gordon Gecko
Shrimp tempura, jalapeño, and cucumber topped with avocado, seared tuna and spicy mayo.
Complaint: This one was better than the last two (I find it hard for anyone to mess up shrimp tempura) but the avocado was NOT fresh. 3/5

Yo Adrian!
Cream cheese, krab and tempura green onion inside, topped with smoked salmon sashimi and chopped dill.
Complaint: I wish they used real crab but I liked this one. Wasn't the best sushi I ever had but it was pretty decent. 4/5

Milky Way Drink
Okay so on their online \"Happy Hour\" menu this drink is described as: Milky Way
Sobieski Vanilla Vodka, Dutch Chocolate Liqueur, Irish Cream, and vanilla cream with a caramel rim. 
On their \"Specialty Martini Menu\" the drink is described as: Pinnacle Chocolate Whipped Vodka, vanilla infused cream, and chocolate with caramel rim. 
Complaint: I ordered, expecting the first. Pretty sure I got the second. My fault for checking the online menu and not looking at the physical one but they should change their online menu to reflect the one they serve. 4/5

I also ordered the miso soup but we were sitting outside and in the Arizona heat that was a terrible idea on my part so I won't review this item. 

Service was a 5/5. Bathroom toilets don't flush or there is some trickery involved with it. Girl in the next stall also couldn't figure it out.

Overall: Come during happy hour and it's decent. If I had purchased this during normal hours I would have given this a 1/5 and complained to a manager."}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour is very IMPRESSIVE! Drinks are AMAZING! The Orange Dreamsicle one is what I get every time. It is only like $5 for happy hour and is very large. The Macademia Nut Crusted Chicken Strips with Sweet Chili Sauce is to die for and only like $4. Such good happy hour specials. Very hip atmosphere. The only small complaint that I would even have is that I wish it opened earlier. I went there two different times in the afternoon and it was not open until dinner, bummer. Now I know. Amazing Food, Drinks, Service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"...they served us Kraft (from a box) Mac and Cheese!!!!

I used to like this place but after I last visited with my wife who is pregnant I will never go back!!!
The sushi was always good...not great...but good. The prices have always sucked $$$$ way too high for what you get. They go down a bit for happy hour but there are much better places in the area with way lower prices. Blue Wasabi is a trendy place however!!

Getting back to the pregnant wife....She can't have sushi so...
She ordered a little of this and a little of that. One of her favorite things in the world is Mac and Cheese. Most restaurants these days have out of this world versions that are mouthwatering, not Blue Wasabi!!!
They served us Kraft (from a box) Mac and Cheese!!!! I was appalled but as a rule I never complain about food in a restaurant... that is what yelp is for!
There is no excuse for this!
With all my reviews I will give them another chance if the owner addresses this review on Yelp...until then...stay AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Blue Wasabi a couple times now and it's well.. just okay really. They put a lot of creativity into the names and ingredients in their signature rolls, I admit.... but not creative enough to try different types of fish. I can't begin to say how many I saw with shrimp tempura in them. Love shrimp.. love tempura.. but not usually in my sushi.

Last time I ended up getting the summer lovin, which was wrapped in pink soy paper (yes, sometimes I'm that shallow), the veggie specialty roll with salmon added to it, and the spicy scallop. Everything was okay, but not the greatest. The summer lovin was ginormous and hard to eat gracefully. I mean, aren't you supposed to magically turn into a hot manga babe when you eat sushi? If so, the summer lovin' definitely ruined my shot. I did, however, appreciate the willingness to add salmon to the veggie roll.

Another thing I appreciated... the banana dessert, though honestly, you'll want to share this with someone else after gorging on sushi.. I know I'm not the only one who does that. However, it's worth it... it's truly divine.

The service was kinda hit or miss. We waited a bit after we got our sushi due to not having any place settings. We also received more attention from a server that wasn't ours as opposed to our own.

Additionally, I don't deal well with places that don't give me a resting place for my chopsticks."}
{"text":"I am from California originally and was always skeptical about getting fresh seafood in the desert, but Blue Wasabi is always so fresh. I have always had really friendly and prompt service as well. Definitely a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"They had fresh uni today and it was amazing! Thanks to Bush for letting me know it was in. I always have a great time here."}
{"text":"I went here for late lunch/ happy hour on my break from work so I was eating alone at the bar. The initial experience was nice but a few things bothered me. I ordered the Gordon Gecko, it was supposed to have jalapeños in it but I didn't taste any heat at all and didn't see them. As I was eating my meal no one came to check one me,I DIDNT EVEN GET A REFILL ON MY WATER! And I had a manager (im assuming he was because he was wearing black) come by and SNATCHED the paper covering from my chopsticks without acknowledging me or saying excuse me or anything. Then when I was clearly done eating I sat there forever waiting for someone to take my dishes or bring my check. I had to ask the sushi chef to go get the bartender to bring me my bill. And it wasn't like they were busy, there were tons of employees hanging out and talking instead of doing their jobs."}
{"text":"I was meeting with a group of colleagues for drinks and dinner.   I arrived with 5 minutes to spare for happy hour so had my order ready for the server. .. Never saw him until 5 minutes after happy hour was over, so 10 minutes total.   The service continued to be slow throughout the evening and was not worth the 18% gratuity automatically added to the check.   The restaurant was busy but it's Friday night so perhaps adequate staffing would be good.  I can get over slow service if they are at least apologetic,  but that certainly wasn't the case.   The manager was clearly irritated by our request to keep some chairs open for late arriving guests, even though we had been told earlier it wouldn't be a problem.   The food was ok, a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. We avoided the inside due to the fact of its tight tables and nightlife appearance and opted for a high table outside. It was nice. As usual we ordered Miso soup, Edamame and four  rolls. I had the rainbow and the fish was pretty good with the exception of the shrimp, too chewy for my liking. My boyfriend had a mango roll and shrimp tempura and a orange chicken. He was pleased with all three. We might go again, as long as they have outside seating. Their happy hour kind of sucks but good for people who enjoy drinking."}
{"text":"9/3
Walked in ten minutes before 6p.  Just in time to order a few apps during happy hour!  However, half-priced happy hour apps and beverages were very limited in number and marked with smiley faces, and they were so hard to spot on the menu!  Perhaps having only ten minutes to hunt them down exacerbated my difficulty of spotting them, but I hope the managers consider having separate easy-to-read menus printed and used.  Liked that martini-drinkers have many martinis to select from.
Tried a couple of rolls, but I can't recall much to write about except that I would probably come back to try other apps and entrees not on the HH menu, but I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"We are here tonight for my daughters 15th birthday!!! The family can count on awesome service, great food, and a celebration for all!!  We love that Gilbert has such a great sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Great food and the service was really good! And the atmosphere is awesome! Go for happy hour, because the drinks are so fun and unique!! So very yummy!!"}
{"text":"Dinner with my family started out enjoyable enough. The food was rather mediocre, though I wasn't expecting much being far from any sources of fresh fish, or Japanese cooks. I also decided to steer clear of the blue wasabi that looks like it's been dipped in anti-freeze. It was obvious their focus was not on food, but on drinks and creating a fun atmosphere. Their decor is hip and contemporary, with a color changing wall above the bar, and abundant flashing lights and TV screens. They try to continue the theme by naming their signature sushi rolls with silly names like \"Eating Nemo\" or  \"Kiss My Bass\", though a few like  \"Me Soy Horny Roll\" or \"Dirty Sanchez\" hardly make you think of sushi. Despite the second rate food and the epilepsy inducing environment, hanging out with your 4 yr old nephew is always a good time...or so I thought.

Close to the resolution of dinner, I took a break to smoke a joint behind the restaurant. I'm from Cali, so...I was being a bit nonchalant and careless about it all, not realizing the laws here are a bit different. I was just chatting on the phone with my girlfriend while trying to mind my own business. A girl from Blue Wasabi who was also hanging out in back of the restaurant smelled it, and asked me to \"please move on\"...I replied \"Sorry! I didn't realize I was disturbing anyone, thanks for telling me nicely.\" And I put it out and returned to my table.

10 minutes later the cops are hauling me out in front of my parents and little nephew. 5 minutes later I'm in cuffs and they're charging me with a class 6 felony.

Wow...I couldnt believe it. This girl, even described me as \"nice\" to the cops, yet she called the cops on me as I peacefully patronize her restaurant with my family! Does she have no heart? What a cruel and unnecessary thing to do! Things like this make me lose faith in humanity. Why would someone wish such terrible treatment upon a fellow human for no good reason? It makes me deeply sad. 

I can't in good faith recommend a restaurant where they treat their customers like criminals, literally."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Blue Wasabi for a special time for us. Our waitress was nice and they were running a Sunday special that  gives 1/2 price off all alcohol drinks for the day. I ordered a raspberry lemonade for myself and Shirley Temple for my daughter. For sushi - a shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna, and tuna avocado. When I checked into the restaurant, a coupon came up for buy 3 rolls and get the 4th free. We ordered a spicy crab roll as well. The rolls were okay. Spicy seemed less Japanese spiciness and more American tabasco drenched. 

When I received the check, I was surprised when my martini was full priced and asked my waitress who asked the manager. He informed me that since I used the buy
3, get 4th free promo my alcohol would be full price. I explained to him that I was never told this and I wouldn't have gotten the 4th roll if I had known and he pretty much gave me the \"sol\" speech with no attempt to throw in a dose of customer service. I let it go because I didn't want to upset my daughter but when you're food is just okay then your customer service should really make up for it. Sure it was just $5 more to my bill but the fact that I won't be returning with my seven person foodie family will cost him a lot more."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi San Tan

I bellied up to the bar here and was immediately greeted by a smiling happy bartender. Very nice gal (From Tampa Florida) and she handed me a menu and explained about the happy hour special. I perused the menu and was shocked at the happy hour value. Kirin Light 'biggies' for 3 bucks and add a jumbo size Sake for a buck and a  1/2 - are you kidding me. I sat near the service well and the bartender would give me \"tasters\" from the excess in the shaker of all the colorful martinis she was making. Great stuff. 

I ordered 4 items to eat. BBQ Drunken Shrimp, Chicken Skewers, White Tuna Sashimi, and Cajun Tuna Sashimi. 

BBQ Drunken Shrimp - great looking item. A jumble of marinated shrimp cooked perfectly on a platter of thin tangy BBQ sauce. Served with some nice toast points to soak up the delicious sauce. 

Chicken Skewers - item was satisfactory. It had a nice presentation however it wasn't chicken breast but rather darker chicken that was cut and skewered on sections on to the stick. It had a nice sauce and was accompanied by a ramekin of dried chilis and powdered chili pepper and tasted fine. Only issue again was the non white meat. 

White Tuna Sashimi - my least favorite of the four. The meat was cut a bit to thin; however, was fresh. The orange and ginger sauce was near non-existent. Not terrible item but not real memorable either. 

Cajun Tuna Sashimi - Awesome item. Good quality cut of fished seared perfectly on the outside and sliced ruby red on the inside. Fanned out on the plate it looked great. Only issue was that the sauce was good but not enough of it. Real bargain for six bucks. 

My friendly neighbors at the bar ordered the appetizer mushrooms which looked fantastic and I will definitely try them next time. 

Great Service - Great Ambiance - Great Food"}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi has become my new favorite sushi joint in town! A very hip, trendy, sushi bar with young, fun servers. I was never a sushi fan, but always loved the idea of \"going out to sushi\". With that said, it's very important to me that a sushi restaurant offers a variety of non-seafood menu items. I had The Clucker and The Bada Bing both wrapped in soy paper and they were both amazing! We heard that Sundays were 1/2 alcoholic beverages if you wore a blue shirt, so after church we actually drove home and changed our shirts before going but when we got there, we heard the server offer the special to our neighboring table who weren't wearing blue? It was a great experience and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time here this evening. I came during happy hour and tried the California roll and Garden Gecko. I thought since it was tempura shrimp and seared tuna it would count as me being adventurous with sushi. I texted Andrea K. and she confirmed no, that doesn't count. Still - it was good and thet drink prices at happy hour were excellent. Just go with things that have a smiley face and they are half price until 6. 

The waitress, Heather took good care of us - and soon my attention turned to sake. A gecko roll, California roll, 2 Kiren Ichibans and 2 caraffes of sake - $23. Nice! Heather was very cool and had a most excellent tattoo. She was even friendly after we walked back to the car after being tossed from Gordon Biersch. What a cool waitress. She let us sit for a long time and continued to wait on us. I would come back here any time for happy hour."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! I have loved Blue Wasabi ever since it first started in DC Ranch over 10 years ago and expanded into central Scottsdale with its second location. Now the location in Gilbert is the only one left and it's obvious why! We went here a couple weeks ago and we're even more disappointed than the last time which we thought was a fluke. We always order a ton of different dishes but our surf and turfs were the biggest disappointment. They gave us raw steak on top of the roll when it's supposed to be seared. We asked her to please take the dish back and have it prepared medium rare to medium. We watched the waitress give it to the sushi cook and watched him make faces and jokes in front of staff and customers. He then took out a blowtorch and just tried cooking the steak that way. When it came to the table it smelled and tasted like gas. We informed the waitress once again and asked her to take the dish back. It was met with more attitude and not once did a manager come over and apologize or ask about it. The service and quality of food have gone way down hill. We drive from the north side of the valley, so we won't be returning anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this restaurant because I've heard great things about this restaurant from family living in the area. We ordered a couple of rolls ( I can't remember which ones though!) and the one I got was the spicy tuna. I thought it was good and the presentation was nice. The service was a bit slow, but it was a busy night. Our waiter was extremely nice and apologized for the delay, but it was a great first time experience at Blue Wasabi!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Loved everything except ironically the soda... My husband and I have had sprite and root beer from here and it had the weirdest aftertaste... Sushi is bomb though!"}
{"text":"Sushi is probably my favorite food.  And this is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix.  (Sorry, the very best is in San Francisco).  Great food, excellent drinks, and a lively atmosphere make this place one of my favorite hang outs.  The staff is also pretty chill and seems to deal pretty well with the rush.  Having waited tables at two busy bars, I truly appreciate this."}
{"text":"Good sushi fills me up. My husband and I left this place hungry. We walked across the street to Paradise Bakery for a sandwich afterwards. (wah wah) 

We got the fried crab wontons to start. They were served with applesauce...odd combination. We got the squid, spicy tuna and yellowtail rolls. The sushi was SO SMALL!!! Sushi is supposed to be bite-sized, but these were microscopic. Rip-off for the price we paid. 

The sushi rice was a little warm (gross) and the seaweed wrap was chewier than it should have been. 

I understand the restaurant is trying to be innovative with the dark blue wasabi, but I prefer the traditional green. I mix green wasabi with soy sauce to get the perfect shade of brown and gauge the intensity level. The soy sauce doesn't change with the blue wasabi, so good luck guessing!"}
{"text":"Super fun and creative restaurant! Fun items, and cool ambiance. Great for a weekend night with friends"}
{"text":"I love sushi I would say it's my favorite food. I think  this restaurant is trying to put a spin on sushi and it's just not my style. Also I think it's not worth the price of the rolls. Martini's were delicious."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if your in Gilbert.  While the prices can be on the higher side I've always had a pleasant experience here.  They have a good happy hour. Lots of different flavored Martinis. And the sushi isn't bad.  My favorites are the Wango Mango and the Topic Thunder.  You definitely need to try those if you haven't. 

If you looking for a cool place to have a few that has more of an adult feel then this is your place.  Not the best sushi in AZ, but for Gilbert your inky other choice is Ra or Kona.  Pick your poison.   

I choose Blue Wasabi."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! I love the Spicy Tuna Roll so good!! I get it every time, does have alittle kick to it so if you like spicy then this is for you! As far a the Martinis I love the Lemon Raspberry Ice and Milky Way! Great atmosphere and nice employees :)"}
{"text":"By far the best martinis on the planet!!! They had me at orange Julius martini. Took me back to my childhood when I used to get them at the mall but better because of vodka, LOL. The Milky Way martini is also delicious and I highly recommend it. I'm not a sushi person at all so I really appreciate they have appetizers on the menu like mini sliders w/ fries and southwest egg rolls that are also yummy. Love this place!! I hate I moved out of Phoenix. I haven't found a place like this anywhere else. I always make a point to come here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is much like other trendy sushi places with it's ambiance. But they have a good variety of specialty rolls and drinks. I love their blue-colored wasabi! If you're in the area, Blue Wasabi has something for everyone, whether it's with friends, family, or on a date. I think it's cool and my parents certainly like it. They have TVs for Sunday football (for the sports enthusiast, like my stepdad) and they're located in one of the prettier outdoor malls, Santan Village, in Gilbert (for people like me and my mom who love to shop). The prices aren't bad - seems like the norm for this type of \"hip\" restaurant. And you'll crack up when you read the names of their rolls. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say because the sushi is good and the staff are friendly, attentive and quick. Keep the sake coming and you'll have a good time!"}
{"text":"Great location and great sushi rolls.  Sundays are half off all drinks.  I will miss this place when I move out of Gilbert.  This is the last location in AZ.  Great atmosphere and great staff."}
{"text":"Wow! Did we enjoy ourselves! Nice atmosphere. Convenient location. Friendly staff. All great things, but nothing compares to the incredible variety and deliciousness of the menu! Their house specialty sushi rolls are unique combinations and everyone we tried was a winner! 3 of us finished off 6 rolls - including every smidge of the sauces!"}
{"text":"I'd love to give them 4-5 stars but the service lately had been horrible. The food and drinks are good and consistent, and good happy hour. Service gets worse every visit. We waited 25 minutes to order food and get water while our waitress stood in the corner flirting with another waiter-- and they were slammed."}
{"text":"The in-laws were in town and wanted to treat us to Sushi. Super busy Friday night and we didn't have a reservation. What were we thinking?!
The wait was a good hour. I could see why as we were seated. The service was great and the sushi was fantastic! Who would want to give up their table?! 
We went for several special rolls including the Marilyn Monroll and the Surf and Turf along with some of our favorite traditional rolls like Philly roll and tuna roll. Simply amazing! 
We plan to return. Heck, the In-laws were still raving about it days later!"}
{"text":"Well... we came here for their happy hour. Great deals between 4-6pm on Happy Hour days. A variety of martinis are $5. As you can see  they're a large size and tasted great. Sake combos were $6.75 and lasted 3 to 4 bombs. They even let you hit the table with chopsticks to drop it... but it was getting really messy so we stopped that.

The food was pretty good. I don't like sushi so we got some chicken which was tasty. The sushi all looked good and appeared to be made fresh when ordered. They deliver things as they finish, so food was just randomly arriving which was kind of weird but it all got there. 

After food we continued doing saki bombs... and let's just say I'm not really sure what happened after that. Haha 

Overall, we had a good time here. Their happy hour deal was well worth it giving large martinis and plenty of saki. The food was good, however the delivery timing was random so waiting for everyone to get their stuff would have been awful. Service was nice and the place was pretty busy the whole time we were there. I'd come for another happy hour once I recover from this one..."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend yesterday because of the reviews on Yelp and we were both really disappointed. 

The atmosphere is very club like- if you're into that sort of thing then it's something that won't bother you. But, it definitely wasn't my kind of ambiance. It seems like a place that should be on Mill Ave. Really you are paying for the atmosphere of a club-like environment, not the food. 

The food was terrible. It was really bland, hardly any taste to anything we ordered, even the sushi rolls that were supposed to be spicy were still tasteless. Even the avocado on our rolls tasted like nothing. 

I went expecting the same kind of food as RA, but RA is so much better. I would rather pay RA's full price menu than eat at Blue Wasabi for happy hour. This place is not even worth trying- it was a waste of 20 bucks."}
{"text":"It's a love hate thing -- I don't eat much sushi, but I can't help when everyone else does.  So I generally end up at a sushi joint.  I can say as a non-sushi eating person - I enjoyed Blue Wasabi.  I think it's the \"blue wasabi\" that makes it so special.  Drinks here are a tad bit pricey, but I've never been here for happy hour nor \"Special Blue Days\" -- I guess if you wear a blue shirt on certain days; you get a discount -- makes sense.  Service is okay, but shouldn't their uniforms be blue?  Maybe the Blue Sailor Moon!!?? Wow I got an idea! :) - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at your restaurant this week.  The restaurant environment was extremely enjoyable.  I would definitely revisit Blue Wasabi. Blue Wasabi is a place that anyone can go to, its not just for certain type of people. if you haven't tried sushi, or afraid to try it you should start here. 

I visited Blue Wasabi this week and enjoyed their different versions of the traditional rolls that you can find a lot of places, they also have different rolls you can't find anywhere else. The wait staff was friendly, and on top of their work at all times. The lighting was set at the perfect level, and I really enjoyed their decorations as well.  The wait wasn't long at all, even on a busy Friday night. Popular restaurant, in a popular place, full of an amazing food and people. 

If there was anything I could change it would be the prices, it was a little pricey and some would think that it's not worth it. Other than that it is a great restaurant and a lot of places should take notes."}
{"text":"I was expecting good sushi.... and I was not disappointed!  We had martini's, sushi and dessert.  I recommend the Magic Mike martini and the Kaboom and PITA roll.  Thanks to our server Cathy.  She was attentive and offered excellent suggestions. We'll definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"the only time to go there is for happy hour. otherwise, it's overpriced for average sushi fare..."}
{"text":"SanTan Village is quickly becoming 'Scottsdale East' as The Blue Wasabi Sushi and Martini Bar adds another trendy, upscale restaurant to its list of tenants. 

At first glance at the name, I didn't think Sushi and Martinis was a good mix but after taking my wife there on a 'date night', I'm a believer. We're both hooked on this place. We enjoyed everything we tried. My wife especially like their use of soy wrappers instead of seaweed in some of their signature rolls. Some of our favs are the MARILYN MONROLL, RED HOT CHILLI PEPPER ROLL, and the ME SO HORNEY ROLL.  We haven't tried them all yet - but we intend to. 

One thing to note, I would stress the 'BAR' in the name of this establishment, as, at least during the weekends, the Martinis flow and it can get loud in there - I would call it a 'Fun, Adult Atmosphere' - one we enjoyed without the kids. 

Another plus, as crowed and busy as it gets, we have always been pleased with the service. On our last visit, our server,  Tara, turned us on to some great new dishes and some incredible drinks. For me, when a server takes the time to help make your experience enjoyable, even when their 'bouncing off the walls' busy, that's exceptional - And I think this is the first time I've ever remembered my servers name so that's gotta say something. 

So, it's trendy, got good eats, good drinks, fun atmosphere, and super service, so why just 4 stars? Price, when a couple slices of raw fish can run as much as a prime rib dinner, that's a bit steep. Wash it down with a few $10 martinis and your looking at a pretty pricey evening. Nonetheless, were hooked."}
{"text":"The sashimi is not fresh, the filet minion skewers are not tasty, gamy. The service is good. But the food is terrible. Glasses aren't clean. Just terrible food"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good sushi, creative rolls. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. Always have a great time & enjoy the food, but it's always cost me. The bill ads up quickly!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Love the setting, and the service is great. Employees are very understanding. I had to send my order back because I forgot to tell him I was allergic to avocado and they had no problem, but other than that it's up there with the most tasteless rolls I've ever had :/ the blue wasabi tastes funky and ginger is way too pink. Too much food coloring if you ask me."}
{"text":"Overpriced, crowded, loud and sushi rolls are on the small side especially for the price. Food was ok but for the price, crowd, and noise not worth it."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now, and well, it just doesn't live up to its hype.   It is trendy, clean, decorated nicely, located strategically, and the service is good.   But for me, the food is just \"eh ok\", the special martinis are just \"eh ok\", and its pricey."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great in the play sitting outside with the heaters on however I must say that had to be the most Bland and tasteless Sushi I've ever had and I am not trying to be high maintenance. I probably will not be coming back there the prices weren't even that great either. Sadly because I really wanted to like a place despite the bad reviews"}
{"text":"ONLY go during Happy Hour. For 2 small apps, one traditional sushi roll, shrimp and crab dynamite, 2 half off martinis (Tues ladies night) and 2 beers, our total was $60, $72 with tip. YOU have to be kidding me. I think that's insane. We could have done a comedy club with 2 drink min for the same price or pretty much anything else that night. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. ONLY go here if you can make it for happy hour. The only positive is that happy hour starts pretty early...around 4 or 4:30pm."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Blue Wasabi. I love sushi; it is my absolute favorite food, and trust me, I've had a lot in my lifetime.

When we walked it, it was a nice-looking ambiance. I love black with blue lighting. It reminded me of another trendy sushi place, Ra Sushi, and my experience at Ra wasn't too bad. So we sat down, excited for some good food!

The menu was interesting. Lots of trendy names. However, it was a lot to take in at once. My friends and I agreed that it would have been less overwhelming if the menu had been perhaps organized better, perhaps into categories like soy wrapping, main types of fish, or some form of organization for the rolls. I got tired of reading everything pretty quickly. 

Warning: if you want iced green (matcha) tea, they don't have it. Our server didn't tell us anything in fact. Nothing about it being ladies night (50% martinis) or that they didn't have an iced green tea. She just simply brought over a pot of green tea and a glass with ice. I was a bit baffled. Had I said it wrong? Had she misheard me? So I looked at the menu - yes, I should have looked at the menu before ordering my drink, but it's such a staple in sushi and Japanese restaurants that I hadn't even thought to look. And she had not bothered to let me know that they do not have a separate iced green tea. She was nice about it though, and I ordered the dessert blossom black tea instead, which was delicious. 

Now, for the food... So, blue wasabi. I felt like I was looking at play-doh when they first brought it out. But I figured, I'll just eat it. It's cute. I took pictures. But then... The blue just muddled my sushi. I was confused looking at it, because I felt like I was supposed to be eating a blueberry juice or smoothie from the color it stained my food. But it was wasabi. It was just so odd. And when you dip your nigiri, you dip it on the fish side. When I lifted my sushi up after dipping, we all looked at it in horror. It looked pretty disgusting, and my friend joked that he had projectile vomited all over it while I wasn't looking. Very unpleasant. I had to eat the whole time, avoiding to look at it.

As for the food itself? Meh. Nothing spectacular. The nigiri was actually warm and not the best quality. For the price, I expected much better. We also go some rolls including the Tail-er Swift and the Marilyn after reading some comments on yelp.

The Tail-er Swift had this layer of wonton inside. It had this unpleasant bite.. Like someone had left some stale hard crackers and decided to put them in. The taste itself wasn't bad, but again, the fish was warm! The Marilyn had a soy wrapper, and actually it was the better of the options for me, both in terms of taste and texture. But again, not quite worth the price. 

Service - pretty abysmal as well. She had not told us about the specials, she had brought over the hot green tea with ice without telling us, never refilled our drinks, and to top it off - she spilled some soy sauce from a plate all over my friend. No apology. To be fair, I am not sure if she noticed, but she still was not careful. You just don't lift a pile of plates that high and put plates over them that roughly, while standing right over you customer. That was just the final straw. Horrible experience.

I wanted to like this place. I REALLY REALLY wanted to. But the only good thing about the experience was my dessert blossom iced tea. The food, the prices, the quality, and the service were pretty bad.

I looked to the table next to us during dinner and realized they had only gotten drinks. Maybe that's what this place is really for - some drinks with a few munchies if you get hungry. I just don't see myself coming back here for a full meal again. Maybe I'll try happy hour at some point. But I wouldn't go out of my way to go there, even for that. So sad to be disappointed. :("}
{"text":"my wife and I loved the food here!

We went just after happy hour on a Friday night. So it was pretty busy, but a perfect time of year for sitting outside. I would NOT want to sit inside though, it is a giant LOUD echo chamber in there - think 100 people in a bathroom with loud music and you get the idea....

Here is the food we had and review:

SPICY YELLOWTAIL TEMPURA MUSHROOMS: Outstanding!!!!!
CRAB WONTONS: Very good
WANGO MANGO: excellent!!
SUMMER LOVIN: very good

Service was average. Our waitress was not very friendly and seemed flustered and always hurried. But did not make any food mistakes at least...

Overall, we really enjoyed this place and found the sushi/food to be excellent."}
{"text":"Last night I went to Blue Wasabi for the second time in the week. I am a new fan. We went at 4pm when Happy Hour started and boy did we have fun. We sat outside on the patio and my group of 4 only ordered 'Happy Hour' items off both the food and martini menu, but we ordered alot. The martinis at Blue Wasabi are top notch, I ordered a Lemon Drop martini, the Mowie Wowie, and the \"Milky Way\" which tastes just like the candy bar and comes in a caramel dipped martini glass. Yum! The great thing about Blue Wasabi is they have more than just sushi on the menu, so if you're not in the mood for seafood, there are other items to try. For instance my companions ordered the Macadamia Chicken Strips which came with a sweet n sour sauce, and we ordered the 'Fowl Play\" which had Grilled and chilled chicken and wrapped like sushi. Both items were perfect to taste. We also ordered many seafood items such as the 'MARILYN MONROLL' one of our favorites and we love the presentation of it but our new favorite by far is the 'WANGO MANGO ROLL\" it tastes so different but is AMAZING! You must try it. We are still trying to figure out if the Blue Wasabi is made blue with food coloring or if it is actually a different kind of wasabi. It tastes a lil lighter than the traditional green wasabi. Our waiter Chris is one of the best waiters in Phoenix, he remembered us from last time and gave us top notch service, he is attentive without being intrusive. We were there for HOURS last night and some in our party got a lil tipsy off all the martini's but we had a great time without breaking the bank cause we left right after Happy Hour ended. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great sushi and even better martinis.  Located in DC Ranch, Blue Wasabi is a small but cute little place with a nice patio out front.  The sushi rolls are...uhm creative to say the least and have names like the dirty sanchez for one example, 
The martinis are fantastic- I tried one made with Pama and it was amazing. They have tons of specialty martinis on their menu for you to choose from and service is usually pretty fast. 
This is a great place to go out for happy hour because you can always hit one of the other bars in DC Ranch after if you feel like going out."}
{"text":"Loud over priced and not worth the hassle. Waiters were surly and service was slow. Drinks were cute but expensive. Don't bother."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever for some good old happy hour. I only come here for the happy hour though because it has spoiled me and I refuse to pay anything but half price for these delicious rolls. Don't worry, happy hour happens frequently. The best part? Happy hour is on Saturdays too!!! They have a ton of rolls, appetizers, meals, drinks for half off. Sometimes there is a wait, but this is definitely worth it. Every roll I had here was great. The best ones are eating nemo and dirty sanchez. The names of these rolls are pretty comical, but once you take a bite, you wont be laughing. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the climax of the \"wanna-be, uber-cool, all flash no substance sushi chair\".  Everything is overpriced. The food and drinks are standard at beat. Service is unimpressive. There are so many good authentic sushi returants that are owned by families that you should try before this corporate cafeteria. Oh and the tables are terrible also."}
{"text":"An upscale Japanese fusion restaurant in the San Tan Mall area. Great bar, especially for mixed cocktails. I've been there a couple of times during \"happy hour\", and was not disappointed. They have a wide assortment of sushi at \"happy hour\" prices."}
{"text":"We've been to Blue Wasabi several times, in groups big and small.  It's always a hit.  The sushi is not the best I've ever had but it's solid...no complaints here.  

For drinks I recommend their sparkling sake.  When I heard about it I was a bit skeptical but it's really good!  You can find it at Bevmo, by the way...just can't remember the name right now.

If you can get past the freaky blue wasabi that does look like playdough (as someone else here said) you have to try the following:

-Ahi Tuna Poke - so fresh and yummy
-Seared Yellowtail with jalapeno sauce - a bit of a kick

The special rolls are good too.  I'll never forget the Marilyn Monroll.  You have to try it just to say the name!

We never have a real problem finding a table here.  It does get crowded but it's not unbearable.  And they have heaters outside so it's actually a nice spot in the winter.  You know, the one month when it gets cold in Phoenix.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Big fan of sushi and sushimi. Quality fish, but you pay for the atmoshere. Catch them at happy hour and go to town!"}
{"text":"I have lived near Blue Wasabi for over two years and decided to pop in one day when I had a craving for sushi.
Lucky for my boyfriend and I, we happened to go during happy hour and the deals were great! We tried a variety of the sushi rolls and all around were pretty impressed. 
The sushi was fresh, but some of the flavors did not mesh well for my taste. 
The hot edamame was great! I couldn't stop eating the little pods, even after the sushi was served.
My only gripe was the waiter seemed to be on another land. For about fifteen minutes I went without a drink and finally walked up to another waiter and requested she help me find the waiter or water- whichever would be faster. Even after the waiter realized we were guzzling water, he seemed to be distracted by something else. As soon as the sushi was served we were handed our ticket as well, despite the place not being busy. That never sits well with me. . . but I suppose in retrospect it was good or we would have waited a while for that as well.
All-in-all if I am around the area and crave sushi  I will go. It seems like they have great alcoholic drinks, so I am curious to see about their happy hour solely focused on the drinks. 
Will try again and hope to not get the same waiter."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! The staff is the best there is  Stefan has the best recommendations !!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow (especially for a Saturday night around 10... It was pretty dead). The specialty rolls were awesome and had cutesy names. Also, the combinations were very unique! I highly recommend the Marco Rollo and Surf & Turf rolls. Cautionary advice: the wasabi at Blue Wasabi is actually blue (imagine that), but it stinks of dye and preservatives & tastes gross... AVOID!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had amazing sushi and martinis from here. I had a pineapple martini which was surprisingly so fresh and delicious. We definitely will be going back for date nights. Also, the customer service was great."}
{"text":"Well I think to some up our experience I will leave you with this one brief sentence:

My daughter poured out some soy sauce to dip her sushi in and a dead fly came out of the soy sauce jar.  Enough said....."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi spot ive found in the valley  (aside from higher end places).  The shrimp tempura inside the rolls are actually crispy and all the sushi is well balanced. My only complaint is That I live in Biltmore and can not go every week :/"}
{"text":"I have visited this location in two occasions and both times the rolls have been very good. Creative cuisine. Drinks are always great and the service is prompt and attentive.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've ever ate at other than a tropical island. Make sure to end the night with a berry white martini and the rainbow roll dessert."}
{"text":"Great place to chill with friends. Me and my husband always get the dam jumper and the kaboom! You will not be disappointed. It did however take us a couple of times to find what we like because there sushi is so unique."}
{"text":"Dry sushi and quite bland.

Edamame was undercooked by a long shot.

Orange Chicken had tons of Orange Peel and little chicken.

Not good!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place ever. I live in Scottsdale and I make the hour and fifteen minute drive at least 2 times a month. The wango mango roll is amazing! I also get the mi soy horny and Krusty krab. You must try this place. Places like RA don't even begin to compare to the atmosphere, customer service, and food at blue wasabi."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the diverse menu, freshness and well-prepared food that hits the table, quality table service, and variety of drinks. The price is a little spendy, but this isn't a place most go frequently anyway. I've had a pretty good experience with the service being very good at the table, though drink and food has been slow to arrive to the table. When the food starts coming, it often is well-paced. (I typically go here with 4-6 and we share a number of plates.)"}
{"text":"Food was solid here prices a bit on the high end but tuna was fresh . They need to add some beers on draft and they would of had my 5 star review"}
{"text":"Nestled between the pizza joint and the swanky seafood restaurant off Market St., Blue Wasabi rocks my world. Tiny, tiny, little place. More room on the patio than inside. The everchanging colored panels behind the bar may make your head spin, if like me, you indulge in their fabulous martinis. The rolls are inventive and dee lish. I like the surf and turf with filet mignon and lobster tempura...omg...I'm crying now just thinking of it. The calamari salad is also a must have. The crowd is oh-so North Scottsdale. Lots of white, blond people and a sea of silicon. And I'm talking about the guys! I was a regular here when I lived at DC Ranch, kinda far from my Central Phoenix digs. I think Sundays, if you wear blue, you get half off. If you don't wear blue, they charge you double. No, just kidding. It's worth the drive for the food and fab patio, views of McDowell Mountains. The crowd, however, kinda vacuous and pretentious. Yikes! Origato Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Yelpers didn't let me down!

When my girlfriend suggested we head to this place for a little sushi, I immediately did a little research and was pleased to see what great ratings were earned.  I also did a little research online.

Since it was Sunday, we wore blue and got 50% off our drinks.  Cute concept!

Blue wasabi...heheh...genius.  It looked like play-doh....

The plethora of unique martinis made me spin with confusion until I asked our nice waiter.  He recommended the Lemon Rasperry Ice.  A little sweet, a little sour, a lot of Mmmm!  It's mighty dangerous however, since you can't really taste the liquor....unfortunately, my genes make me turn a little crimson when I get a little alkihawl...so as a human alcohol beacon, I could tell it was definitely potent.  No watering down here!

The sushi menu has traditional items on one side (boring) and inventive fusionistic items on the other (why not?)....so of course we turned to the dark side.

Killer Bee made sense when I saw it plated.  And as an eel lover, I savored every sweet and succulent piece that tickled my tongue.  It's my new favorite.

I can't even remember the other rolls we tried, I keep thinking of that Bee.  But I do know they didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth.

Cool blue ambience
Neat bathroom sink fixtures (I notice those wierd things)
Cushy blue seats
Mondrian-esque blue background behind the bar
$9 Martinis that went to $4.50 for wearing blue

Definitely a must do again!"}
{"text":"Love the wango mango roll and butta face martini. Lots of great things on the menu! A little pricy but happy hour is good!! One of my favorite places.cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often. I like the sushi (a lot more than the Kona next door. At kona, it's always super fishy). This place is a modern, hip environment. The servers aren't super nice - they give you basic service and just leave you alone. Which some people like and some people don't. I personally like it, as long as my food is hot & out in a decent amount of time & my drink is full.. I'm happy. I don't need small talk from a waitress. 

The Martinis are good but expensive. Happy Hour is the best time to visit - but the staff moves slow on purpose to limit the stuff you can get. 

Overall I like this place - but it's for a certain type of customer. Get the crab wontons, and the mango wango."}
{"text":"10 people working behind the sushi bar, and three patrons at the sushi bar. We had to ask for a menu, the guy just kinda threw it at us and left. Got our tab and left. The service sucked. My first and last time here."}
{"text":"The sushi was not to bad, I got the \"yo adrian\" However the happy hour prices even on a Saturday  was a great deal. The pork dumplings were nice."}
{"text":"Blue Wasabi is amazing. They have the greatest service, they were all so friendly. They were so fast at taking our order and bringing the food out. The sushi tasted delightful, I love going to this place. It has a very nice atmosphere and you always leave feeling happy."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Awesome martinis!  I love that they have traditional sushi and cooked options. I LOVE the Get Clucked. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We drove over 50 miles one way to satisfy our sushi cravings.  We were not disappointed. The food is stellar & the service excellent.  The sushi is always fresh & melt in your mouth delish.  We ordered the other wasabi paste diced and prepare for some fire! The ice cold Kirin beers were appreciated!  
The owner Jim is always there, working along with his wonderfully trained staff, overseeing & making the patrons feel welcome & special.
We love this place and only wish it were closer!"}
{"text":"Well, their happy hour ends at 6:00 but it is a pretty good happy hour.  Half off some of their cocktails, wine and what not and half of some rolls and other apps.  What gets me is the wasabi is actually blue.  Yes, that's the name and all but do we really need to be so contrived as to actually load up the patrons with Blue No. 1 and 2 (maybe a touch of Green No. 3)?  That just grossed me out to no end.  The intensity of the color still disturbs me.  Their second strike is the name of their rolls.  Really, I want something presented to me as the \"Dirty Sanchez\" and the \"Me Soy Horney\"?  They all tasted fine but the names alone did them in.  We won't be back.  I had been to the location in North Scottsdale probably four years ago but it was after wine tasting and we were all wasted so maybe that's the key to a good meal here.  Complete obliteration."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and WOW it was awesome. Service was great and the sushi is top notch. Great drink menu with large vodka menu. We'll be back again for sure. Oh yeah, Happy Hour is a great deal too!  Half price drinks and rolls!"}
{"text":"i finally tried this place yesterday with a friend and I don't get the hype.I have had a lot of sushi in my life so forgive me if I might be too harsh. 

i got the \"get clucked\" roll and my friend got the \"dam jumper\" roll.  First off, the portions were tiny! When the dinky rolls came out, my friend and I both gave each other a knowing look. My poor friend is a big guy and he just looked downright sad. (We got burgers after thankfully). Second, the rice was soggy and mushy. Really unappetizing. The get clucked roll was doused in sweet and sour sauce which only made the mushy-ness of the rice worse.

I can't speak much about the dam jumper roll because I didn't try it other than to say it was depressingly small. 

On the up side, the service was great. Extremely attentive, helpful, friendly. Everything you could ask for. The ambiance is nice: clean, modern, with an ipad on the table to order and a huge projector screen. For these reasons, I couldn't give the place only 1 star (but come on... this is based on food right?)"}
{"text":"BEST MARTINIS. Some of their drinks are better than dessert; order a dessert drink like \"buttaface\" instead of dessert and you'll be happy. Well, I always am.

The food is really good - we always get the garlic edamame. It's spicy. I like spicy so it's good for me- don't order it if you aren't committed. Crab wontons with plum sauce are worth getting. We even had their street tacos - odd for a sushi place - but they were awesome! We are picky about our tacos so I didn't think they had a chance. I've had sushi here and I think I remember it being good. 

The experience is always good for me and whoever I go there with. The waiters are friendly and I've never had a problem. 

Overall, we like coming here. My husband and I save this place for a back-up place to go if we are trying somewhere new for their cocktails. At least we know we'll get something we like by the end of the night!"}
{"text":"Staff is excellent, beer and wine selection is ok. Roll selection is great, me soy horny, chuck Norris and tropic thunder are good!!"}
{"text":"\"Summer Love, Chuck Norris, Eating Nemo and Yo Adrian\" - These are some of the clever and fun sushi rolls offered at Blue Wasabi! 

If you're looking for clever, unique and creative sushi - this is the place to be! Blue Wasabi has a cool vibe, making you feel like your at a bar under the sea. On top of the chill atmosphere (which includes large flat screens and projectors for any sports game you may be interested in) it also provides a wide selection of sushi rolls and martinis. 

Everything my party had was delicious, we enjoyed all the different rolls and martinis we had. I would rate this location with 5 stars but 1, 2, 6 drinks and rolls later and you can be spending a pretty penny here. Blue Wasabi has an expensive price attached, if I could provide any advice, come during happy hour - you've been warned!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour. I got the \"oh me soy horny\" roll, it had Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper. This has been by far my favorite roll I have ever tried. I had my daughter with me this day so I also got some orange chicken. This was a lil dry on the inside and didnt have too much flavor. My sister had the chuck norris roll, it had Spicy salmon and panko crusted shrimp inside, topped with sashimi salmon, avocado,
fresh squeezed lemon juice and togarashi. She said hers was very tasty as well. We went here during happy hour. Our total bill was $30.00, this included 2 cocktails, 2 different rolls, orange chicken and another appetizer. I liked the happy hour alot, good prices and good vibe. This place is packed during happy hour but well worth the wait. I also been hearing that ther is an ipad at your table to order. I didnt see this anywhere so not sure if they no longer do or is this just at certain times?"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Los Angeles and my friend who lives in the area wanted to have a belated celebratory birthday dinner for us both at Blue Wasabi. Her & her husband love this place and she raved about their food. Good sushi & great company? I'm all about it... We arrived around 7pm and I was dropped off out front in hopes of securing a table for 6 on a busy Friday night. They only had room for 6 at the long communal table in the center of the main room but I wanted our party to have a table of our own. A manager stepped in and said they just had to clear out a table and we would be seated. Im pleased to say we were seated in less than 5 mins. Excellent.

Blue Wasabi has a very modern vibe from the not-so-typical heat lamps outside in the dining patio to the color changing backdrop behind the sushi bar and the high chairs & tables we were seated on. Very blue from the seat upholstery, staff shirts and even the plate our unagi was served on. Oh and I cant forget the wasabi was actually blue. I'm somewhat of a purist but I was game. I liked that they changed it up a bit. It's definitely unique. 

We started off with the spicy rockin shrimp tempura ($14.50). This was so good. It's served warm, crispy, sitting in a lettuce cup inside a martini glass. The shrimp was crispy on the outside, tasted fresh and lathered in a slightly spicy mayo. This dish is a star... And we subsequently asked our excellent waitress Kathy to bring 2 additional orders of this deliciousness. As soon as they brought one to the table, our party inhaled it. Order it. Dont even think twice.

Others things we ordered were: the unagi (fresh water eel) sashimi plate ($11.25). I love eel & this unagi order had generous slices of the goodness drizzled with the requisite eel sauce. I liked it... Next up was the crispy spicy tuna ($10). This was excellent. I even had to let the manager know that the way they served it up (still warm) was the key to enjoying this dish fully. The crispy rice makes it... with the spicy tuna, jalapeno slice, cilantro and drizzled in sauce. I also let the manager know that they executed this dish far better than the famed Katsuya restaurants in Los Angeles whose signature appetizer is the crispy spicy tuna. Those Philippe Starck designed restaurants can learn from how they do it at Blue Wasabi. Order it. Trust me... Next was the Marilyn Monroll ($14.75). It's tuna, yellowtail, spicy tuna & salmon alongside avocado, cucumber & crab wrapped in a big roll of pink soy paper. It was good. Dont try to scarf it in one bite unless you're ready for the heimlich. It's a biggie... Next up was the Yo Adrian! of Rocky Balboa fame. It's a roll with crab, cream cheese topped with smoked salmon. Good stuff... Next was the kaboom roll ($13.50). It's a plate of cut california rolls with a mound of baked shrimp dynamite topping it. Good stuff. It tasted great. It's a lot of food on one plate. Delicious... Next was the bad boy of the bunch. The dirty sanchez ($13.75)... it's a tempura battered roll with eel, crab, cream cheese topped with a teriyaki-like sauce. It was very good. And I do not normally mess with any rolls with cream cheese but I would order this again & again. It was quite tasty... Next on the menu was the wango mango ($8.25) roll which has spicy krab in a mango sauce encompassed in soy paper. It wasnt one of my favorites. It wasnt bad. Just not as good as the rest... Next up was the grammy award winning tail-er swift roll ($9.75). It was made up of spicy yellowtail wrapped in soy paper topped with yellowtail sashimi & avocado. It was very good. The flavors & texture went very well together. Good stuff... 

I have to say I was very impressed overall with Blue Wasabi. The staff was great. From Kathy our awesome waitress, to the manager who assured us of a table to our liking to Jim the owner who treated us like family. It was a great, memorable dinner of good times & good food and drinks. Jim the owner recognized my friend & her husband as ones (she) that asked why there werent any coconut flavors in any of their specialty martini drinks. Jim said he would have something to her liking when they returned and sure enough there was a drink named after them (her husband). The infamous MAGIC MIKE.... Hahaha... Awesome. Order it ladies! or gentlemen... Whoever you are, just order it! Jim also showed us some aloha by insisting we add to our order of the dessert banana nut spring roll (DELISH) to celebrate our birthdays, by adding the chocolate rainbow roll (YUM) and comping us both of them. What?!? How cool is that?? That was above & beyond... Oh and that Magic Mike drink was on him as well since my friends were the couple that inspired its creation.... Amazing.

All I know is our whole experience from Kathy to Jim and the stellar dishes that were served and thoroughly enjoyed by our party has given me no choice but to be a customer of this fine establishment every time I'm in town. Thank you Jim. And thank you Blue Wasabi."}
{"text":"I have to start off hb saying that our waitress, Paula, may have been one of the best waitresses I have ever had. If every waitress at this restaurant is like her, it is no wonder they are so busy. She was incredibly helpful with food and beverage recommendations and all the food was delicious! I highly recommend the spicy garlic edamame, Chuck Norris roll, and buttah face drink for dessert! I will definitely be returning as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Best martinis! Tuesday is ladies night $4.75 martinis!! Service was amazing, loved all the martinis we tried and we tried 3 each! Super quick service!yummy yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was hit and miss for me. Two of the rolls we had were excellent, the Marilyn Monroll and the Surf & Turf. The Marilyn was really fresh and clean tasting with a soft texture, due to the pink rice paper, and a great taste. The Surf & Turf was my favorite, and one of my favorites I've ever had. It's hard to find a roll with beef tenderloin on top and even harder to find a good one. The texture and flavor on this baby were outstanding and I loved every bite. The sake we had was really good... Kikui I think was it's name or something close. Now on to the let down. We ordered a Dirty Sanchez roll and it was very poorly executed. You would think a completely different person did it. It was completely falling apart and the tempura batter on the outside was almost nonexistent and very uneven. Each component had to practically be eaten separately because it was so sloppy. I also ordered the Key West martini because I love Key Lime martinis, and although it was good, it was more like a vanilla milkshake and I couldn't taste anything close to a lime at all. Pretty bad when your place advertises itself as a martini bar. Better get those right. All and all it was a good experience and the decor is modern and hip. The actual blue wasabi they give you is a nice touch too. It's not cheap though and if you can I recommend going during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great environment, staff was friendly and service was fast. Prices were higher but the food quality and choices made up for it. Between all of us we had about 8 rolls and each was very good and the blue wasabi was a nice added touch. The restaurant was very busy and the spaces are compact so you got to meet who you were around. It was loud and hard to carry on a conversation but overall we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"When it comes to reviewing a place where we dine occasionally it's hard to know if I should write about our general expierence or what will probably be our last visit there. 

I feel they are a bit overpriced so we usually go during happy hour where the half price drinks and sushi bring it down to normal price ranges. It is almost always crowded and you'll almost always have to wait to find a seat. It's not a very child friendly restaurant either with very high tables and chairs. 

Generally though the service is good and the food is good. We got the stuffed mushrooms last time which I believe are new and they were delicious. 

However after our last expierence I don't think we'll be coming back. We tried to bring the kids to this visit and were reminded why we never do. After 2 table changes we finally just tried to hold the baby on our lap at a booth. One thing to note is we are a mixed race family so we do occasionally get some weird questions when we are out together but we were asked 3 times if we were on seperate checks as if the waitress could not believe people of different races could be together. 

Her disbelief apparently only escalated from there. The baby was acting ridiculous so I took her outside while we waited for the food. The mushrooms I mentioned above were new so when they came out my wife didn't know we ordered them and said they had the wrong order (my mistake). The waitress came out and said \"that man\" ordered them. She said \"you mean my husband?\" the waitress said \"I guess that man outside with the baby\". At the end of the meal I took the baby outside again and said \"Just give her the check\" pointing to my wife. The waitress brought the check over to my wife and said \"that man said you were going to get the check? is that ok? are you ok to take the check?\"

Very uncomfortable meal. Not a good expierence. Maybe send the staff to some kinda diversity training or something."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, I'm a sushi newbie but what I had I enjoyed.  My particular favorite seems to be the Yo Adrian.  The red hot chilli pepper and Marilyn one are good as well.  I haven't tried any of the drinks or small plates yet but they look good."}
{"text":"Service at bar and drink was good. You'd be surprised how hard it is to get a filthy martini on the first try.  The rolls had cute names but for the price lacked any real pop in flavor. Overall, it's an ok spot. Doesn't know if it's a trendy spot or a sports bar though."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOOD!!  We really enjoyed the sushi, the California rolls with Shrimp dyamite  were awesome.  We also had one with mandarin and cream cheese that was so good.  They also offer a happy hours but we missed it by 30 minutes.  It was really loud on the inside.  So it might be better on the outside if you are trying to converse.  The rolls were large like sushi on steroids."}
{"text":"If you don't care about service then you won't have a problem here. The sushi was good. Very creative and fun menu. The spicy shrimp is delicious, but a little pricy. 
As far as a service, it was AWFUL and I won't return because of that. Our waiter was rude and pushy. We were waiting at our table for our friends and told him our party was on their way. He asked us about 3 times after we told him. He was not friendly at all and unprofessional. Didn't even say thank you when we all left as we walked pass him."}
{"text":"They kill in customer service, overall atmosphere is awesome. Great lighting and sushi chefs are very informative on what everything is! Will definitely be back during the week for happy hour. #HotSakiBombs!!!"}
{"text":"We've heard mixed reviews from our friends about this place. Mostly that it was more a bar than a sushi restaurant. We decided to try it anyway since it was open later than our 2 usual spots. We were pleasantly surprised. Our waiter was great, super helpful with explaining their menu and gave some great recommendations. 

The Surf and Turf roll would have been good if there hadn't been some sort of sauce on it that I just didn't like that much. Their salmon nigiri was good, the yellowtail was a little too fishy for me but I'm very picky when it comes to yellowtail. I forgot what else we ordered but it was pretty good iirc. Their prices are a bit on the high side if you miss happy hour. We might stop by here again, but it just wasn't good enough to topple our two favorite places."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and figured I go with an open mind. Sushi was horrible not fresh and lots of imitation crab and imitation fish used. Sushi smelled fishy never a good sign. Will not go again."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent but very spendy. I don't care for the loud music or bad lighting. We've been there approx. 4 different times, staff not so friendly. Of all the places to choose from in the E. Valley now, this would not be our first choice."}
{"text":"A Scottsdale favorite.  This is a great little sushi bar even though it is out in the boonies of northeast Scottsdale.  Small, breezy, casual but stylish, and fun.  They really did manage to blend a sushi and martini bar pretty seamlessly.  It can be a little bit of a scene and it is definitely an older well-heeled crowd due to its proximity to DC Ranch.  

The food is great.  Very creative sushi rolls.  If you are a purist, you will HATE IT.  I am a fan of good food, so I LOVE IT. One example:

Where's the Beef Tempura roll with seared beef tenderloin, asparagus, avocado and shrimp, lightly fried and drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. And the martinis are smashing.  

TIP:  I went on a Sunday last summer and they gave us a big discount because I was wearing blue.  It was 50% off, I think.  I hope they do this every summer..."}
