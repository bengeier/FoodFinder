{"text":"I went here for a friend's graduation dinner. The seating area was filled. We had reservations and they were right on time. The service and level of professionalism was great. The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Visiting town w work. Wanted a good meal. Food and atmosphere were excellent. I will visit again when back in town"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a salad and glass of port in the early evening, wanting to relax before an evening of paperwork and a late supper. The salad and port were good. The hostess was pleasant. But otherwise the service was unprofessional and dispiriting, hence the two stars.  The server was middle-aged but acted as sullen as a teenager. He didn't check in at all after bringing the food, not even to top up the water. When he collected the plate, I told him, \"It was wonderful\"--which it had been. \"Good,\" he chirped. When he brought the check, I thanked him and he actually responded \"Yeah.\"  I might go back, because it's generally a nice ambience and the food was good. But not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pros: friendly staff, good bread pudding  Cons:  - mushroom soup was watery - appetizer: tasteless calamari was dumped in slightly spicy tomato sauce - Caesar salad had ONE piece of anchovy in it.  - 4 pasta dishes were far too big and all bland.  Seafood seems to have all been blanched in water and mixed in with sauce.  Eggplant was dry.  Very disappointing meal. To make up for the high prices and mediocre food, the solution seems to be \"increase the portions\". What a mistake!"}
{"text":"I went to Vin Santo with some work colleagues while in Middleton for a conference, and it was terrific!  The restaurant is small, with dimmed lights, which makes for a cozy setting.  The hostess and waitress were very welcoming.  We arrived around 7:45 on a Tuesday, and we were the only people in the restaurant, which seemed unusual, but maybe it was because it was a weekday?  Anyway, I ordered the scampi carciofi, which consisted of shrimp, garlic, artichokes, olive oil, and cherry tomatoes served over spinach fettuccine.  The portion was HUGE, and the food was fresh and very tasty.  My colleagues had the eggplant parmigiana, which looked and smelled delicious, and a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but which also looked pretty good.    I'm not sure Vin Santo is the best place for a business dinner, but for a romantic date, it's perfect.  I will make sure to come back here whenever I am in the Madison area, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hearty, delicious Italian meal."}
{"text":"This was our second trip and I was honestly expecting it not to live up to my expectations, since I absolutely loved everything our first trip. Luckily I was not disappointed. You guys, the mussels! I don't know how they get so much flavor in there but they do. The lasagna. Salmon. Spicy Italian sausage. Everything we've had has been delicious, along with really great service and a homey atmosphere. Cheers to the cook!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and wine.  Mussels are great...actually everything is.  Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner with a group of six. Made reservations on open table and the table was ready early for us which was nice. It is a small, cozy place with a nice atmosphere. Our server was a very sweet younger gal. We had two bottle of the house chianti and it was very good and reasonably priced. One person had the Caesar salad, two people had the creamed spinach soup, and we shared the calamari and bruschetta. All were very good. They catered very well to a eight year old with a side of butter cappelletti pasta since they don't have a kids menu. I had the pollo Toscana, other had a sausage pasta, shrimp pasta dish and lasagna. Portions were huge and everyone took leftovers. We also shared the bread pudding and triple chocolate cheesecake. So stuffed and so happy! I would highly recommend it and will go back!"}
{"text":"A bustling, lively atmosphere couldn't save Vin Santo's food.  The decor is tacky, the waitstaff tired, and the food dreadful.  Seafood ravioli was CLEARLY of the frozen variety, slopped on a plate, and covered in canned tomato sauce.  My seafood fettucini wasn't any different as bland frozen seafood chunks swam in a thin sauce reminiscent of ragu.    I realized my after-dinner fare (coffee and dessert) was going to be as cr@p as the food when staring down the coffee pots steaming for over an hour.  YOU CAN'T CLAIM AUTHENTIC ITALIANA AND SERVE BURNT COFFEE.  It was only 7:15 and they had \"ran\" out of cannoli (forgot to thaw).  Luckily a gelato shop down the street (villa dolce) supplied me with the only thing delicious I got to eat this evening.    The prices are high.  Real high.  Higher than anything else in the area.  This is what earned Vin Santo it's sterling 2 star review.    Summary:  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can't believe people rate this four stars on average.  First, I believe many people in Middleton must be starved for good food, this in no way is a four star Italian restaurant.  It's okay and that is it.  I say this not as a snob, but as someone who knows food and is reasonable with expectations.  My wife and I both had the pasta, they use a fresh pasta - although I don't know if they make it on premise (could be store bought - like you see in refrigerated aisle).  The sauce is made from tomato paste as the base - which can be fine, but it is too concentrated and they way over sauce the pasta - it is overly aggressive and not appealing.  Overall this place is okay, but let's not make it out to be authentic or fantastic.  I've lived on the east coast, in Boston - gone to North End hundreds of times so I know my italian.  Average at best."}
{"text":"You NEED to go here. I was a little worried about going in wearing running shorts and tennis shoes with my hair looking a mess, but the staff there was more than accommodating even though I looked like a bum.   The owner came over to our table multiple times and even made a special wine drink for me because I didn't love the selection they had (which was delicious by the way). Our waitress was a literal angel - that woman was SO SWEET and so helpful. She even wrapped our pudding leftovers specially so it wouldn't leak on our way home.   The food is AMAZING. There really isn't much else to say. We got bruschetta and my boyfriend ordered the Scampi Gabriella and I ordered the special which was a lobster ravioli (the picture I've posted - beautiful, right?). Amazing. Then the bread pudding, which is enough to feed a small country, was the best I've ever had. Delicious.   Long story short, although the inside is a little quirky, the staff and the food are amazing - I will absolutely be frequenting Vin Santo!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.  I've never had a bad meal (or even a bad bite!) on a visit to Vin Santo.  The seafood fettucini is really heavy on the seafood (they're not trying to stiff their customers!) and they basically serve BRICKS of incredible tiramisu.  Everything tastes so fresh and home-made and they offer a much more interesting menu than most \"Italian\" restaurants in Madison.  I'm so happy that this locally-owned business has found great success - they have lots of regulars (like I used to be!) who keep coming back for the delicious food, big servings, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere.  Vin Santo is a MUST for me when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had an unbelievable experience yesterday. I went to Vin Santo hoping to order some food to go. Upon brief greeting the owner informed us that they \"don't do takeout on the weekend\". This is astonishing and something that has never happened to me before.  I am a foodie an have dined on 5 different continents, including Michelin rated restaurants. Shocked, we went to Villa Dolce where the owner was very accommodating to our take out request. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Your loss Vin Santo. We are never coming back."}
{"text":"Don't understand some of the negative reviews. Prices are very reasonable for Madison and I go for the food, not the decor. My husband and I had great meals. He had a chicken, sausage and shrimp dish. Spicy which our server informed us it would be. I had the ravioli with cheese and artichokes. Portions are large which allowed for leftovers for lunch the next day. Both meals I would order again, but there were so many items on the menu I would like to try. Would be a hard decision.  I would like to see them offer a single serving Caesar salad. Since they don't my husband opted not to have a salad as I was having the Caprese salad."}
{"text":"One of Middleton's hidden gems.  It's our favorite place to go for special occasions! Be sure to try the \"lasagna of the day\". It's always worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and it tastes pretty authentic, too. However, the service is slow, and the place is crowded and dark, which did not make for a good atmosphere when I was here."}
{"text":"Vin Santo rules!    This is a great casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local couple.  She can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen.  Their passion is reflected in the quality of their food and the high level of service provided to their guests.  Their food is some of the best in the area - they focus on Northern Italian cusine.  It's simple, fresh, and delicious!  They always offer a variety of specials.    The portions are huge!  You definitely feel like you are getting your money's worth.  I have never left without leftovers.    My favorite dish is the Scampi Gabriella (jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic, pancetta, and scallions finished with a white wine cream sauce served over linguini).  Awesome!!"}
{"text":"If you've never been to Vin Santo, you need to GO! Quaint, family owned and operated... and the food is FANTASTIC! Awesome wine list too, but solely Italian, as it should be. The Ravioli Vin Santo is one of my favs and be sure to save room to share the bread pudding with someone. It is INCREDIBLE! I would eat here every night, if I could."}
{"text":"Dined here on business with work colleague. He split the caprese, colleague had lasagna and I had ravioli vin Santo.  Caprese was fine, colleague said his lasagna was good. Ravioli was just ok, lacking sauce. The overall meal was fine but the waiter was curt to the point of being rude. I was uncomfortable interacting with him. Acted like we were an annoyance to him even though we ordered and never asked for anything else."}
{"text":"Best Italian food around Madison IMO.  Lasagna is made fresh at time of order.  Calamari is great - not deep fried.  Intimate  setting."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Mostly miss actually. Avoid the eggplant, the oil it was fried in tasted rancid and old. They also use poor quality cheeses that had little flavor. Also I don't know how an Italian restaurant can mess up a simple dish of spaghetti and marinara, but it was really awful, rubbery overcooked noodles and muddy tasting tomato sauce. We ordered a Caesar salad that was good. And my husband's goat cheese ravioli was good. All in all it was overpriced and for the money Lombardino's is a much better bet."}
{"text":"A locally owned Italian restaurant with topnotch food, service and, and atmosphere for a great price! The spicy Italian sauce is amazing along with the bread pudding dessert which can feed four. I will come here every time I visit Wisconsin.....cannot say enough about this place as it was a spectacular recommendation and did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to have dinner with a friend visiting from out of town. Excellent service and outstanding food. Everything was fresh and in generous proportions. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience and service.  We started with bruschetta and Caesar salad to start. - expected warm crostini (or maybe room temp) with our cold (ice cold) bruschetta topping. It was cold and SUPER hard, so hard it hurt my jaw and my husband was concerned he would break a tooth - They informed us they make it and slice day in advance, and the toppings are kept on ice (like not events bit of toasting just before severing?). I've never had crostini like this and to my knowledge that is not the traditional way of serving it.  - The Caesar salad was over dressed with limp lettuce.  They didn't take the bruschetta off the check and was blasé about the whole thing. Didn't even offer something else instead.   Our only good thing was our pastas (good not great). Cafe La bel'itallia, Bisggi's are better and Lombardino's is probably the best Italian in town."}
{"text":"Average food, good service, poor ambience. If you want something a lot better and don't mind the extra bucks, go around the corner to Louisianne's."}
{"text":"After looking around Madison for a good and authentic Italian place, Vin Santo has the potential.  The pasta is definitely fresh, and the tiramisu was very good.  Downsides - I felt that the dishes could have used more finesse in the seasoning and flavor and less in the overall amount, they were tasty but did not just pop out at me.  For instance, the ravioli was great - good pasta and sauce, but the spinach stuffing was just bland.  Nevertheless, I will go back - need to find out if some of those spicier dishes are truly spicy."}
{"text":"This place is great! Cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and wonderful staff. The portions are very generous. Plus some of the best tiramisu. We'll definitely be back again to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I would love to rate their food, but never got the opportunity.  Happened to stop there on a Saturday evening at about 5:45p and could not even get in the door because the hostess was blocking the area with a party of four.  Instead of taking the party aside so we could enter, and I should point out I was on crutches, she had us wait outside until she could seat them.  We entered AND STEPPED ASIDE so others could enter.  There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.  Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted."}
{"text":"Fresh Italian food with a emphasis on fish dishes and cream sauces."}
{"text":"My wife and I ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy to accommodate our dogs.  It had excellent service.  The food was fantastic.  The plates we had were simple fare with exceptional ingredients.  The chef did a wonderful job mixing and balancing flavors.  Even the bar tender nailed the Bellini's. It is very reasonable priced by which I mean a good, long dinner (2 hours+) for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about $100.  It is worth it!  If just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to $50-$60.  This is a great place to dine!"}
{"text":"Vin Santo has excellent Italian food. It is unfortunate that they do no have any beer on tap, although they have a nice wine list. If you are looking for an upscale atmosphere, this is not the place for you. If you are open to a more casual, yet enjoyable dining experience, Vin Santo will likely meet your needs. I would like to see their servers have more knowledge on Classic Italian fare, but otherwise it was fresh, delicious, and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we both enjoyed it.   I would preface that you go to Vin Santo keeping in mind a limited menu whose main courses, with exception to maybe 3 or 4 dishes, are pasta based. Delicious pasta is their thing. Period.  We were greeted by a courteous and knowledgeable wait staff that knew how to direct diners to a desired taste. The atmosphere was cozy and quiet to share a conversation on a date or a close friend.  I had pasta with a white wine cream sauce that had shrimp and prosciutto mixed in. Generous portion of pasta and meat. Everything tasted fresh and was seasoned perfectly. Enough to share with somebody else while getting an appetizer and desert (perfect for a date!) Keep in mind bread comes customary with olive oil.  The only thing that I feel should be mentioned is the interior seems dated, and  though restaurants do aim to look rustic, this is not the theme meant to be achieved here. Some new carpet, paint and tables would be nice."}
{"text":"I took my extended family of 7 here for a special dinner to Vin Santos and it was perfect. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and prompt with our drinks and food. We had mussels as an app., and the only complaint was that we should have ordered 2 of them. Yum. The best meal ordered at the table was a pasta with goat cheese over a tomato base sauce - Fresh campenelli with toamto basil sauce with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts. Lasagna was good, seafood was tasty, and the other pasta dish we ordered was terrific."}
{"text":"Another awesome experience. They updated their menu a little, but this is the most authentic Italian food you will get in the area."}
{"text":"The food was bland for Italian fare.  My wife and I had the calamari appetizer, for $16.  It was disappointing, especially for the price, and we were surprised it was neither fried nor cut.  It looked like stuffed ravioli without the stuffing.  The sauce was described as a spicy  marinara, but it was not marinara.  It was a dark sauce, that was more spicy then flavorful.  For an entree, my wife had the spicy Italian lasagna.  It was fine, nothing special, however it was $17 and extremely overpriced for the quality and ambiance.  I had the shrimp ravioli, which was tasteless and overpriced as well, at $24.  Additionally, we barely saw our waitress as she was very inattentive.  When asked by both our waitress and the manager about out meal, we replied \"it was okay.\"  Both of which treated the reply as if the meal was a positive experience.  For the price, the ambiance was less than to be desired. For example, we counted at least 6 different types of chairs.  We had the pleasure of sitting in uncomfortable \"fire hall\" banquet chairs and luckily we got along great with the table next to us- as we were on top of them and ended up chatting throughout the meal, due to the layout of the restaurant- not something you' expect for a $100 meal (with Tip, tax, and a bottle of wine).    Worst of all, when approaching the manager/owner upon departure, we were told \"it would be nice to know about this during your meal.\"  Rather than apologizing, the owner took the low road and was defensive.  We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, nor will we be returning."}
{"text":"We were not too impressed. We were staying in Madison and drove over 30 minutes to get here. I wish we wouldn't have wasted our time. The outside of this establishment is nothing to get excited about, and once inside, it is dark and dingy. It could use some matching chairs - the garage sale look doesn't really cut it for a place with such high prices. We were seated in the back by the kitchen, and it was so dark it was hard to see the menus. It seemed not well kept and our table was sticky. It appeared to look like the hostess was possibly the owner. Since it was such a small place it seemed that all she did was nitpick and hover over everything and anything the servers did. I felt like she was watching everything we did, as well. I asked our server for some grated Parmesan cheese for my oil - to dunk the too-hard bread in - and she had to get it approved by the owner. I asked to try a sample of the sauce that was on the menu as \"spicy\". It became a big deal. (The sauce they actually had me sample was not what was served with the meal, after all).  Another disappointment was that they advertised Moscato on the wine list and they were out of it. I was offered another wine for $10.00, which I didn't like, and left it on the table. My dish came with very bland spinach fettuccine and a sauce way too spicy for my taste. The fact that soup or salad does not come with the meal was also disappointing for what you pay. My husband actually enjoyed his chicken dish and the cannoli was very good. If it wasn't for these two positives, I would give it 0 stars. We won't waste our time going back."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal! My wife and I went here for our anniversary, everything was outstanding. I had the scampi diavalo, which was a little spicy and had a light sauce that was delectable when soaked up with the provided bread. My wife had a different scampi dish which was also delicious. We finished with some tiramisu, that was big enough to share with 4 people. Definitely give this place a try, it's my new favorite."}
{"text":"Meh. Definitely not 5 stars. All the seafood in my dish was well overcooked. The linguini was good and fresh. The waiter clearly didn't want to be there and the hostess (assuming the owner) was crass. Will not be going back. Also it's no where near business casual - sweatpants appear to be just fine. And the prices do not reflect quality."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad to say about Vin Santo! The prices are the same as Olive Garden but the food is 10x the quality and 5x as authentic!  I have eaten at Vin Santo five times now and I am never disappointed, everything I have had is delicious, and the dessert (bread pudding, tiramisu) is to die for.  The owner is very sweet and accommodating and she is there everytime I go, it's a local family owned business with world class cuisine!"}
{"text":"Balling in Middleton. Definitely a good place if you don't mind driving from Madtown."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in the Madison area.  Everything that crossed our table from the fresh pastas to the delicious sauces was a treat.  The portions were generous and the prices reasonable.  The calamari in the appetizer was tender and delicious in a rich and spicy tomato/fennel sauce.  The puttanesca sauce was dense with olives and the whole cloves of roasted garlic were a real treat.  The bread pudding was very good, but for me was a little heavy on the cinnamon.  I think I'll go with the Tiramisu next time.  Our water was pleasant and attentive.  The atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic...  but I would rather see real candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this little restaurant! Its tucked away and has a very intimate atmosphere. The Italian food tastes homemade and authentic.  This is a great place for a date but not for a family."}
{"text":"Oh my!  This place is so good!  I always get the lasagna, which is made fresh. It is served in its own dish, which is a huge portion size. It takes them about 30 minutes to cook it but it is worth the wait. This is not a fast food restaurant and has a homey feel to it. Great place to be!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Like others said not really that impressive on the inside, the tables are really jammed in there.  I guess that ok if you don't mind you waitresses butt in your face and food when she is at the table next to you.  I ordered pasta with scallops, shrimp, mussels, and calamari with a slightly spicy tomato sauce.  It was ok.  The pasta was cooked perfect.  And again like others said, it really lacked salt.  The seafood was good lots of mussels could have used more shrimp and scallops and a lot less squid!  My wife had the special of giant homemade ravioli with a caramelized onion and portabello mushrooms in a balsamic sauce.  This was really tasty.  The bread pudding is amazing!  Not pretty to look at but delicious!  The coffee is great too!  Would give more stars if they used a little more salt and a few less tables.  I would have also liked to see a few more meat choices.  The menu is really mostly seafood and chicken.  A few sausage offerings but no other choices of meat.  A nice steak would do wonders."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals we have ever had in a restaurant and that includes fast food and the ubiquitous chain restaurants.  Paid $120 for a chicken dinner, some raviolis, appetizer and a very average $30 dollar bottle of wine.  I had chicken piccata that was a pallid, poached, old chicken breast covered in a mucus-like lemon sauce.  It is advertised as a oven roasted chicken breast, which still would have given it some color.  Any cook knows that chicken piccata is supposed to be sautéd giving it rich golden brown color and buttery flavor. My husband had Ravioli al Vin Santo a ravioli filled with spinach and cheese and topped with a sun dried tomato cream sauce.  Most likely from Sam's Club.  It was at least edible, but definitely not worth the price.  You could have a better meal at ANY Denny's, Applebee's, Olive Garden etc. at 1/3 of the price and it would have been better.  I am a fan of family owned restaurants. What I cant't understand is how they have stayed in business.  The decor is something you would expect to find in the North Woods.  At our table there was a leatherette banquet style chair, a wooden captain style chair that looks like it is  from someone's basement and two rattan chairs.The rest of the decor is a strange mix of items including a weird pair of antlers on the 1970's paneled wall.  Would have to say if we had paid $60 for this meal, I probably wouldn't be writing such a review.  I think if you charge $$$ for a $ meal you deserve the truth.  I could have eaten at Papavero or Francesca's and paid less for a much more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I reserved the dinner there to celebrate my parents' 50-yr anniversary. Before making the reservation, I did quite extensive look on Yelp, to find somewhere that offers nice food and attentive service - I wanted to make sure the night is memorable to them.  After the visit, I felt overall it's a good experience but not excellent --  1. Nice little quiet restaurant with light opera background music, the waitress was attentive and helpful to pick the food for us. The furnitures are like from garage sale (agree with another reviewer) -- they don't match, they show their age with all the wear and tear. Minimal decorations in the restaurant -- I wish it could be a little more vivid.  2. HUGE portions, 3 out of the 4 entries we ordered tasted very good, except Pollo al' Tuscana which the chicken breast was quite jerky instead of juicy & tender.   Other dishes we ordered are --  Lasagna del Giorno -- sausage Lasagna which was awesome Lobster Ravioli -- very good, I loved it Shrimp pasta -- very good, although the shrimp is not that jumbo, but it's fresh  3. The bread they serve before entry comes was COLD. I was disappointed on that -- I missed the hot bread fresh out of oven from other Italian restaurants I've been to. And it was very chewy, kinda of hard for my parents.  4. They didn't do anything special for my parents' special day. Of course, they don't have to, but if they did, it'll be a very nice touch and we are more likely to go back again. Neither of the owners came out to say anything, or offer anything special, which made me feel a little disappointed especially it's family owned restaurant.  We are likely to try other popular area restaurant before we go back to this one again."}
{"text":"Wanted a early relaxing dinner with a glass of wine . This was it. The waitress was wonderful. She explained the specials & made recommendations. I enjoyed the ravioli harvest special, salad & red wine. Serving size was large with enough for take home. Will be back on my next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"Vin Santo is a good, but small Italian restaurant in Middleton.  There's a larger selection of pastas at this place than most other Italian restaurants in the area. But other than that, it seems like the standard Italian. The lasagna is okay, but small. But most of the pasta dishes are legit and are served with good portions. Service is kind of slow and I'd recommend getting a reservation on weekends.  Nonetheless, dessert is great. Though expensive, their Italian bread pudding and tiramisu are huge and tasty."}
{"text":"GET THE BREAD PUDDING!!! ...This is a nice restaurant that is cramped and casually decorated. The food is the stand out. The front is run by one of the owners and her service is very brief as she seats you and quickly moves on to the next task. The waitresses do a great job with the specials and describing the menu. Food is delivered in an acceptable amount of time. You can see the chef and the kitchen through the window, which is always fun. Their red sauce has a bit of spicy heat to it.  My wife and I really do like this place for its great food and for its character."}
{"text":"Wow, do I love this place! I wish I lived closer so I could eat it all the time!  My family came here when we were staying in Madison. At first, I was a little nervous because it was not located in the city. I thought it was going to be a little dinery Italian place but BOY was I wrong!   We had a reservation and we arrived with some time to spare. The hostess who was a very sweet British woman was very concerned about getting us seated on time. She ensured that we were seated immediately when the other party was finished which was nice.   It looks as though this restaurant is family owned. The chairs were mismatched and there are pictures of old celebrities on the walls but this just adds to the charm of this restaurant.   Our waitress was awesome and was very knowledgeable. We had a large party but she had no problem repeating the specials or being patient. It was nice to have someone so attentive and willing to wait.  She brought over some bread and oil which was delicious. I ordered the seafood ravioli (it was a special) with a creamy pesto sauce. OMG, this was to die for. The ravioli was stuffed perfectly and it was easy to tell the pasta was homemade. The sauce was delicious (even though I wish there was a little more) and I had freshly grated parmesan on top.   I was able to try my cousin's dish and she had the spinach ravioli. Again, delicious sauce and very easy to tell how much care was put in the pasta. I also tried my sister's who got a garlic spaghetti pasta, it was delicious, and my dad's who had a pasta with goat cheese and a type of marinara sauce. I sincerely believe that everything on the table was delicious and I know the owners took the time to make sure it was.   All in all, Vin Santo is delish! It is a must if you're in the Madison area and are craving some seriously good italian pasta!"}
{"text":"Everything was baked fresh, so expect a little bit of a longer wait, but well worth it. Very generous portions -- best plan would probably be to get salads and split an entree or plan to bring some home with you. I had the italian sausage lasagna, which was very very good."}
{"text":"This is the closest to homemade Italian food in all of Madison!! The pasta is fresh and totally  awesome!! My grandfather made homemade Italian  sausage that was very similar to what was in my dish tonight.  I was moaning out loud when I took my first bite.  Such an awesome experience from the bruschetta to the Canoli.  A MUST TRY FOR ANYONE IN A 30 mile radius!!! Will totally return on my next trip to Madison!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food! Our goal of the night was to have a nice Italian dinner and not feel rushed to eat. Vin Santo successfully met our goal and went beyond. Walking in to Vin Santo felt like walking into your Italian Grandmothers kitchen (in the best ways). Our server was fantastic and remained attentive to us throughout the meal. Most may find it expensive, however, for $99 two people were able to share a bottle of wine, share a desert, and we both had an entree that provided leftovers for the next day.   CON: Too many good options and I could only order one entree.  We will definitely be going back there soon to try their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"it was okay.....small place but the food was good....large portions...."}
{"text":"I have come to this place multiple times and eve time I come I am extremely pleased. I love the ambiance and the staff is A+. It may look small but the reward is huge. I give this place a rave review and I know once you come you will too!"}
{"text":"Great food, portions could be smaller. A little pricey for Middleton. Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"I always crave Vin Santo, even though I haven't been there for years, I still have family back in Middleton, and every time we visit, we have a feast! I truly believe it offers some of the best home made Italian food in the midwest. A real hidden Gem. And considering multiple family members have worked there in the past, we know what a tight ship is run, and how genuine the owners are in their hospitality and insistence for high quality in everything they do. Please give it a try, and DO NOT pass on the breadpudding/tiramisu for dessert : ) be warned that it may ruin you for life on anyone else's recipe!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The decor is wonderful and homey. The hostess was nice, and even though I was alone (which sometimes causes less than good service), I felt welcome. I started with s misto salad, which had a delicious mustard dresing. The bread that came with the salad was so-so. The waitress did a great job. I liked that she poured olive oil and asked if I'd like pepper.   The reason this is three stars- the eggplant dish looked absolutely incredible. Great presentation and I could ssee the nice crispy edges that I loved. But once I bit into it, I was perplexed. There was no flavor at all. I'm still not sure how you can make a red sauce that looks that savory and delicious and can be so... bland. I salted and salted and salted and it barely made it better. So very disappointing. The eggplant did have nice crispy edges but was almost too flour heavy. Texture was good, and that's the best I can say about the dish. I likely wouldn't go back again and went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but the waitress was excellent, so she alone gets the extra star."}
{"text":"try their appetizer of steamed mussels and their excellent bread pudding (huge portion).  Their bread was mediocre. I couldn't remember what seafood pasta I ordered; it was satisfactory but not a surprise.   The manager is very nice while the cook has a funny attitude. We went there craving for bread pudding at 5p right after they opened. As the waitress submitted our order to the chef, he said, \"we don't serve desert at 5.\" Anyway, we got our sweet tooth satisfied along with some tea for an hr.   I give 4 stars for the atmosphere and the menu selection."}
{"text":"I've now eaten twice at Vin Santo.  Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.  I have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.  Two of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.  The desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.  I can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future."}
{"text":"This place, man.  I don't even know how to fully articulate my feelings on it but I'll start with the fact that I have never thought it was worthwhile to pay for Italian food because \"it's just noodles and sauce\" ...this place totally changed my mind on that!   It is very rare that you don't see the proprietors working, so you know they love it as well.  10/10 would dine again!"}
{"text":"Party of 4 celebrating a birthday...Seated immediately. Intimate seating, some chairs a little close. Food was delivered piping hot and service was good. Food we had was the lasagne(huge portions) and salmon and one spaghettti, all outstanding. No salads, but they looked good. The only annoyance was the chef/owner? Numerous times during our dinner he was grumbling/shouting loud enough for us to hear from our table, kinda shouting at his sous chef or someone in the kitchen and on several occasions came out and sat and kinda watched people eating..(weird)and grumbled to the hostess about not doing her job.In appearance, she seemed to be very efficient at her job and had stopped at our table and asked how our food was, etc. Upon leaving, he was in the front of the house grumbling again....Not a good thing to do! I would go again, based on the food, but hope this man leaves his sour attitude out of the customers face..Tiramusu amazing. Fed all four of us with no problem."}
{"text":"We fell into Vin Santo on a busy Friday night before a recent marathon that the PIC was running in.  Despite the wait (45 minutes) the owner (a sweet and thoughtful English woman) made every effort to accommodate us and move us up the list, even asking other patrons if they minded waiting just a couple more minutes.    As for the food, none of us could complain about being short-changed...especially the PIC who was carb-loading.  The plates were absolutely delicious and huge (I thoroughly enjoyed the Salsiccia Rossa--pasta with so much homemade Italian sausage that I had to take it home without noodles!).  We all walked away thinking we couldn't have picked a better spot nor gotten a better deal.  The decor was very nice and clean and the staff as mentioned previously was very helpful.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian . Wonderful pastas & sauces. Small but excellent wine list (thank you!).  Being a snobby Chicago ( not suburban) foodie , I'd hit Vin Santo once a week to eat- Right next to Louisianne- now 2 of the best in Wisconsin!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably disappointed.  I'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly.  Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.   I did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service. I travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me."}
{"text":"We have gotten carry out twice from Vin Santo and the food is very good.  The pastas are fresh and delicious, the salads are good, and the tiramisu is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this restaurant with my husband of 37 yrs.  We couldn't have been more disappointed!  Bloody Mary's while we waited for a table (dining room was empty) were absolutely tasteless.  Water at the table without ice.  Bread served was cold, hard and the olive oil on the plate could have been accompanied by grated cheese.  Our \"homemade\" mushroom soup was Campbells soup with a can of rubbery mushrooms added that squeaked when you bit into them. For $8 I expect fresh mushrooms in my homemade mushroom soup not a can of mushrooms.  My \"special\" was jumbo lobster/shrimp/scallops ravioli  straight from Sams Club with a dollop of tasty sauce that had a bit of a kick (but not enough quantity for the dish).  My husbands \"special\" lasagna was so overcooked that the bottom was actually charred and the noodles a mushy mess.  Sauce was dried out from the over baking.  We travelled from out of state to try this restaurant on our special day and all we got was an overpriced worst meal ever ($70) and a laugh at the glass of wine served in a glass that seemed to have lost it's stem (reminded us of some old Packer glasses we used to own).  The mismatched chairs and secondhand look of all the tables were not \"quaint\" at all and the atmosphere was not Italian, romantic, or quaint."}
{"text":"\"Ummm Good. Yummy. Tasty. What is this delicious piece? Do you wanna try this? It's good.\"  Those are pretty much what my bf and I said to each other during our Valentine's day dinner. No footsies or romantic hand holding but just shuffling forks with an extreme eager to try each other's plate. Vin Santo is THAT good.   I got seafood Ravioli with pine nuts, which completely blew me away. It is by far the best Italian food I've ever had. They made their own bread: crisp and tender. Their Tiramisu will brighten up all of your taste bulbs. Appetizers and desserts are made for sharing, so be friendly to each other, less conservative and share. Go make a reservation now. You'll love this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. But the food was a disappointment. Ravioli, dry, we had two different, meh. Lemon chicken was better, but not thrilling."}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem and one of the finest Italian meals I've had anywhere.  Homemade pasta was perfect, meats were prepared just right, and the sauce was out of this world!  Staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Outstanding! This was our first time here and it was great. The server was very nice and responsive (he could have known a little more about the wine selection, but that wasn't a big deal). The food was great, light sauces and tons of flavor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner with friends. Three of the four of us loved our food. I had the Scampi Gabriella which was garlicky but not over done, the shrimp were delicious and the serving was quite large. Others in our party had the Scampi Diavalio and Pollo all a Marsala, both were very good too. The fourth person in our group had the Ravioli al Van Santo. Our friend didn't care much for this dish but we all tried it and thought is was good. The only thing I would say is there was not enough sauce on the ravioli. All of us had leftovers to take home. The service was very good and the atmosphere was quaint and cozy. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Small Italian Restaurant with big Italian taste in downtown Middleton, WI.  Blown away by this place. Fantastic food and very attentive staff. We got lucky and found this on Yelp and gave it a try. We also were fortunate that we called ahead for a reservation. This restaurant seats around 50 people (not an exact count), has a small quaint bar, and a tiny kitchen.  But don't let that fool you this place has awesome Italian food. Frutti di Mare was cooked perfectly and served over fresh Linguine. Salsicca Rosa has fresh made Italian sausage served over fresh spagettini. Both dishes were just beyond delicious  and you dont leave hungry.  Try the bread pudding with hot butter sauce for dessert. Incredible! We will come back to Middleton just to eat here."}
{"text":"Last night of a business trip and this was definitely a great way to end the trip. We opted for an early dinner. The restaurant seemed small, quaint, and not very busy. This made me a little hesitant considering the dinner fiasco last night. However I was quite surprised and impressed by the food quality.  We were given bread and olive oil. Our entrees came in 10-12\" plates/bowls which were FULL. You know when you're eating great Italian when you actually mentally challenge yourself to eat a ridiculously huge serving and try to soak up all the sauce with bread. We were so full we laughed when the server asked us if we wanted dessert.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about their specials. The place must be popular as the rest of the tables were full by the time we were finished. At $25 for a huge entree and a drink, I found it a bargain for such good food.  This is definitely a place I will recommend to coworkers when they find themselves out this way."}
{"text":"Has always been one of my favorites and last night was no exception.  Our server was professional and pleasant.  The food was fresh and prepared perfectly.  Portions continue to be so large that you can enjoy your meal the next day as a left over. The lasagne, which takes extra time to prepare was amazing.  Huge and full of homemade sausage.  It came bubbling and cheesy.  The eggplant parm was loaded with Vin Santo homemade red sauce and the eggplant was lightly dusted and sauteed - no heavy frying or oily mess....just delightful.  Salads are fresh and the dressing is tasty and not heavy.  If I could eat their nightly without gaining 1000 pounds, I would."}
{"text":"Cute, quaint atmosphere. Definitely in my top three pasta places, and my mama is Italian, so that's saying something. You can tell the family takes pride in their traditions and it shows through the kitchen. The homemade pasta was perfectly al dente. The sauce was exquisite. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable - he had their entire menu memorized. My only recommendation is to serve the bread warm!"}
{"text":"Vin Santo's tenure in the Middleton community is something to be applauded (29 years).  Obviously, they are doing something right with a model of \"If it's not broke, don't fix it\".  The food, while it may have slipped in the past few years, is solid and the portions are huge.  This may rate highly with other reviewers but I would rather opt for something smaller and have it taste better.  Don't get me wrong-the pasta is not bad but when compared to others in the Madison area, it is just ok.  What was not ok was their soup de jour-tuscan mushroom soup.  Limp mushrooms in a bland broth, I would pass on that in the future. The interior of the restaurant needs some love as well-very clean but just dated looking. In a pinch, I would not hesitate to come back (the service alone warrants it) but if I am looking for a nice romantic Italian meal, there are a few places that definitely rank higher."}
{"text":"Great Italian eatery. The atmosphere is homey and intimate. I had the spaghetti with pine nuts, olives, capers, and anchovies in homemade tomato sauce. This dish was alright. I liked the idea of adding pine nuts, but the olives AND capers made it too salty for my tastes. I had some leftovers and they were definitely better the next day even if they were still a little salty.   DEFINITELY get the Tirimasu cake while there. It was wonderful. Not too rich, but soaked in expresso and very flavorful. There is a mascarpone cheese based whip cream which is light and not too sweet that makes the cake amazing."}
{"text":"We came in at 5pm, immediately after the restaurant opened. We had my toddler in tow. They immediately sat us directly next to the only other table in the restaurant, which seemed odd to me.  The food was good, the calamari appetizer I would not order again, but the Caesar was excellent and we all enjoyed our various pasta dishes. The tiramisu was the best I've ever had. Our waitress was sweet as can be and very observant and responsive.  Near the end of our meal, the owner brought out a free dessert to the table next to us and not discreetly mentioned that it was because they were sat next to (she pointed her finger towards us) that baby. This alone made me so uncomfortable that I won't go back. My daughter had been very reasonably behaved the whole time.  Anyway, too bad about the unwelcoming environment because I truly enjoyed the food and our waitress was fantastic.   Maybe next time they should seat families away from the only other table in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, but Vin Santo made me alter that practice on this occasion simply so i could leave the 5 stars.  Visiting from out of town, I returned for the third time in as many trips to Madison to this cozy Italian place. In short-- unanimous five star opinion from me and my companions, along with huge thumbs up and big smiles from all.  Thank you Vin Santo.  We will all be back next time we are here."}
{"text":"I came here with expectations high, and I left satisfied, full, and happy. Vin Santo will be seeing me again soon.  I heard of Vin Santo from a friend who told me that if I love pasta, I should try this place out. Even with a reservation, we had to wait around 15 minutes, which was not fun. The wine list here (for the glass) is a tad too limited for my taste, but I did enjoy their house Bellini. The restaurant is very small, and it did feel smaller when we were seated by a large and loud party. However, the interior is very cozy with a warm home feel.  We ordered the mussels for appetizer; delicious, but not blown away. For dinner, we ordered the scampi and campanelli. Absolutely amazing, I was dying with ever bite. Scampi: creamy, savory, perfection. My campanelli was just amazing: the basil and the goat cheese paired too well with all the flavors.   DISCLAIMER: the bread pudding is the size of a small home. We ordered the pudding and cannolis, and we were shocked by how much pudding they gave us (for only $9). Definitely will order just the pudding next time.  Our experience here was just amazing. My only complaints were that the drinks list is disappointing and our service was spotty (but there was a large party present, and we were not surprised). I cannot wait to come back and try everything!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food! We loved it so much, we went back instead of finding a new place to try!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.  We had a caprese salad as an app - I'm sure they were made in advance and chilled.  This salad has to be served at or near room temperature or the tomato and cheese are too firm and flavorless.  My pasta was way overcooked - my biggest possible pet peeve in an Italian restaurant.  The noodles were just falling apart.  My wife said her dish was only as good as something at Olive Garden - yet these are not Olive Garden prices.   We also felt the décor out of line with the pricing - the dining room is very casual, yet the prices are on par with a much more elegant experience.  So we'll probably not ever go back.  We do also wish they had economical kids options - not dino-nuggets and corn dogs, but small portions of good food for under $10."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful family-owned Italian restaurant, probably the best Italian food I've ever had. Definitely the best in Dane County! Get the pasta almatriciana, it's to die for."}
{"text":"We use to love this place. Last night was disappointed meal. The special dish ( pasta fill with lobster) was maybe 3.... For sure not 5 as its needs to be.  Service: we order first dish to share. Why we cannot get extra plate? Why we cannot get water refill without asking again and again? Why cheese not offer for the main dishes and you need to ask? Why used plates taking off the table AFTER the new one arrives and not BEFORE as needed?  Ration between price and food/service quality doesn't allow giving you more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Huge portions of very authentic Italian dishes.  All entrees, salads, apps and desserts can easily be shared.  Very cozy and wonderful servers.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Adam was my server and did a great job of suggesting things as well as being a helpful opinion when I was choosing between one dish or another... -Calamari was heavenly and really hearty and heavy...this is not the kind of calamari that you get at Olive Garden or most Italian restaurants...this was heavenly...perfect bit of spiciness and the portion was enormous -Scampi Gabriela...was amazing...the pasta was perfectly al dente...and the shrimp were huge...a legitimate dinner portion that you had to take home -Bread Pudding for dessert...not at all the type that you get at other restaurants again...this was mushy and didn't resemble the bread pudding I'm use to...but it was actually the best bread pudding I've ever had...it was simply mouthwatering -I had a glass of pinot noir with my dinner and it was a great accompaniment to my meal One of the owners...Clarissa came by and personally asked how I liked the food and the service...we had a long chat...told her what I loved and a few pointers...she has the same name as my mom so I instantly felt a connection with her... This is a MUST when in town...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for my first time for a company dinner so I got to taste several pasta dishes in their menu. All of the dishes were delicious! Also, their tiramisu and bread pudding are to die for!! Best ones I've had yet. They don't get 5 stars because their interior seems dated, could use a little modern touch."}
{"text":"With all of the Italian restaurants in Madison It's hard for me to give this place more than 3 stars. We started out with Mussels that were served in a butter sauce. The mussels tasted a little bit fishy for my liking. For my main course I had veal tortellini. The better half had a shrimp pasta in a white cream sauce. Her dish was far btter than mine. For desert we had bread pudding and tiramisu. Both were excellent.  My Biggest gripes about this place were the kitchen is super small, so it can take quite a while to get your food. Also, they have very few options for kids."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I happened in and had a lovely meal! They offered complimentary bread and oil. I enjoyed the house Sangiovese. I ordered the Chef's appetizer special which did not disappoint. We finished our meal with the largest piece of tiramisu I've ever seen! It was too large for a to go box! It was really delicious. Our service was good, the server was attentive and polite. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Went for hubby birthday food was excellent top notch service in a warm cozy place had Pollo alla marsala very tasty hubby had scampi divi Olla said the shrimp were perfect fresh homemade pasta we will be back"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, friendly, helpful people, cozy place.  This is my favorite restaurant in the Madison area.  I always go there when I am visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the small atmosphere--the food was amazing! And the staff was knowledgeable and professional! Delicious free bread and olive oil, good wine selection, best chicken marsala I've ever had."}
{"text":"Does not live up to a recent review in Madison paper.   Cons: Too pricey & ala carte.  The pasta dishes in range $15- $20. The entrees: $20 - 30. The decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty. Server forgot to put in some of our order.  My ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor.  Need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread & oil. Plus: Nice people.  Good Tuscan mushroom soup. For the tiny storefront, family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations.  It would be fine for your corner Italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their $$."}
{"text":"First time we went it was a 5 of 5.  This time (table of two) was not good at all.  We walked in and were put at kitchen level with no one in the restaurant.  We both ordered seafood dinners, and both came out within 5 minutes (that should have warned us - they weren't cooked to order at all).  ALL, and I mean ALL seafood was well overcooked and rubbery.  I feel like all of it was under the heat leap for a while, which is why it was delivered so quickly.  Shrimp, scallops, muscles... all of it was way overcooked.  Oh, and the waiter checked on us once (as a opposed to the five times he checked on the table of 4 directly next to us, seated right after we ordered).  The first time we came was raviolis, and regular pasta dishes.  Those were fantastic.  I recommend sticking with the actual pasta dishes. Those are something worth coming back for.  The seafood shows that they are a truly landlocked restaurant. Undesirable.  3 stars this time and very poor and rubbery seafood, also the poor service with minimal clientele.  However, their straight-up pasta was quite delicious, and we may be back just for that.  Seafood dinners are between $21 and $28.  Portions are quite large though.  Bring room for leftovers and/or dessert!"}
{"text":"I would rate vin santo at 2.5 stars for food and 4 stars for service. I guess I'm used to great Italian fare in San francisco, but the food at Vin Santo didnt quite cut it for me both times I've eaten here. The portions are large, but taste doesnt cut it for me."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but overpriced.  My wife's favorite dessert is bread pudding and I was told this place has the best bread pudding around, and it did not disappoint, it was excellent. The food was also very good. My wife ordered mushroom and onion ravioli and her dish was better than mine. I ordered a pasta dish with sauteed shrimp, spicy italian sausage and chicken. It was also excellent, but I thought it could've done without the chicken. I started with a caesar salad and it tasted really fishy. Also, the portions are huge, if you're going with one other person, you could probably split everything.  The service was excellent, but the decor wasn't very appealing, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's a very small space. I'd check it out, especially to try the bread putting, but it's not a must."}
{"text":"We loved our meal here!  We will certainly be returning.  Although we were seated at the entrance to the kitchen -- the food and service certainly made up for it!    The portions are huge and delicious!  The seafood was absolutely cooked to perfection.  Next time we will split and entree and salad and splurge on desserts!   Wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Middleton. The hostess and servers are friendly, and the food is delicious. Entrees are large and flavorful. Salads are also large and fresh. Salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, I suggest splitting it. The salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks.   For an entree, I highly recommend the scampi diavalio. It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. There are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste.   Overall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for what they are offering. The food is okay, but far from authentic. The decor is dated and falling apart in places. There are many better bets for Italian food in Madison and Middleton. There is no reason to pay these prices for such mediocre product."}
{"text":"The meals were HUGE and homemade. Service was great. Small bar, but had the means to male what w wanted."}
{"text":"Gem of a small Italian restaurant in a business district.  Really good food, generous portions.   Dined here as part of a business trip, and definitely plan to return.  Best meal of the trip, easily."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me for Valentines day here, impressive I know :).  It was like we were back in Italy.  It's a tiny little place with very authentic italian dishes.  They make the lasagna fresh in individual servings when you order it.  It was amazing.  I had the seafood pasta (my standard order) which was HUGE.  I mean you should definitely split this.  We ended the night with the tiramisu .... and let me tell you, I am a tiramisu connoisseur (i pretty much order it every time it's on the menu) and this was the BEST tiramisu I have ever had.  It even beats the stuff I had in Italy.   All in all this a perfect romantic, date place and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"WOW this place has unbelievable Italian food!! We had a delicious mixed green salad, the Salsiccia Rossa (homemade sweet sausage and spaghetti) and the baby eggplant. Both were amazing!!  We overheard the tables next to us raving about the lasagna and salmon. Everyone was commenting to the Chef how wonderful their meal was. Wish we lived closer-I'd love to try everything on the menu! If you're in the area-this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Went to Vin Santo during a recent trip to Madison and was pleasantly surprised to find this gem of an Italian restaurant. This is NOT your typical red-sauce italian! We started with a Cesar Salad and Calamari in a spicy roasted tomato sauce. The Calamari was tender and the sauce rich and luxurious. Apps and Salads are sized to share. My meal was chicken Marsala - and was not your typical. The sauce was chunky with mushrooms and bacon pieces and a little sauce giving it sensational flavors. For dessert we shared a Tiramisu and it was the best I'd even had - and was big enough for a family! Ambiance was spare but comfortable, service was friendly and very attentive. If decor was fluffed a little I'd give 5 stars! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best pasta in town!! The ingredients and the pasta are fresh. Ordered the fruti de mare and there were a huge amount of seafood. Tiramisu was also amazing~"}
{"text":"BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!  We did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta!  Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. This was the most delicious app I have had--so flavorful and so FRESH!  On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense. We were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was average especially for the price. The bread I wish were warm. The lasagna and eggplant ravioli were the two dishes we had with soups, one appetizer and one desert.  the bread pudding desert was very good. The portions are big but I the quality of ingredients did not strike to me as above par.  Ambience and service were great.   Food was just OK. Not going back."}
{"text":"The food and service are terrific, worthy of a five star but the atmosphere is more two star. Loved the squash ravioli!"}
{"text":"PROS: Great food (if the pasta is not made in-house it is certainly made nearby daily! yum!). Very good service. Romantic setting. A few outside tables.  CONS: (1) The vin santo was served with pre-packaged biscotti (the individually wrapped sort from Costco)!! :( SHAMEFUL! Given that the name of the establishment is Vin Santo, the vin santo itself should have been served with the proper biscotti!! (cantucci). I  was SO disappointed with this. It is a very expensive restaurant - and they skimp on the drink they are named for, geez. (2) The owner has an attitude, she is somewhat snooty. (3) A bit overpriced. It is excellent food, but still, let's not be ridiculous. (4) Arrabiata sauce has cream in it! Not only is in not traditional, it does not taste as good as classic arrabiata. (5) The caprese salad was not made correctly.  -I think Italian restaurants which SAY they are traditional Italian should make at least the classic dishes correctly. Little tiny bar in the middle of the restaurant is...interesting. Great for dates, bad for kids or teens."}
{"text":"Really a wonderful Italian Food experience.  Everything was delicious.  Service was attentive, but not overly stuffy.  Bread pudding is unattractive, but super delicious.  Price is high, but worth it."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!!!!!!!!! Went here last night after trying and not being thrilled with another restaurant in the area. This was the greatest little find ever! The food was fantastic and service was amazing.   We had a huge bowl mussels which we slopped up with the homemade bread. I had a white cream garlic sauce pasta with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and tons of garlic (and I mean tons!) It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever eaten. Husband had a spicy red sauce that was very flavorful with tons on pancetta. Both dishes has really wonderful fresh spinach pasta. Portions were huge and had leftover which I had today which almost tasted even better after soaking up all that yummy sauce.   I'm telling you, you have to try this place. We will definitely be back for top notch Italian food!"}
{"text":"Traveling from California for Epic conference ... our buddy Alex said before we leave: Vin Santo Is a must!  Our party of 3 ... Alex plus my friend Suann and I loved every single item!! Suann and I are Italian heritage and were not disappointed! I checked out other diners as we walked in and I was sure the pasta looked fresh...it was!! I had Linguini a la Pecorino...literally brought tears to my eyes because it reminded me of my grandmother's cooking ... (she has been gone 14 years.) suann and Alex both had the Scampi diavolo which I was able to try. Fresh homemade sausage as tender and spiced just right. Scampi also perfectly cooked. Our server Adam was so helpful and kind. He guided us through dinner choices and the desserts... we ordered the Grappa Bread Pudding...which I literally said tasted like Christmas...plus cannoli. Portions generous and great value for the price. Service was fast but Adam never rushed us as lingered at the table. Go and eat here!!!! You will not be disappointed! Any time I journey back to Epic... a stop at Vin Santo Will be a must!!"}
{"text":"Was up in Madtown from Chicago to run the Crazylegs and used that as a nice excuse to carbo load.  Was absolutely blown away by the food here.  There is plenty of great Italian in Chicago and this was equal to better than anything I've had in Little Italy.  We split a couple caesar salads, Salsiccia Rossa, Pollo Tuscana, and Linquini Pecorino.  Everything was incredible fresh and tasty.  Pasta was cooked to a PERFECT al dente on all dishes.  Nothing was oversauced.  The homemade Italian sausage was awesome (wish it was spicier). Honestly some of the best homemade Italian I've ever had.  Ambiance is great, feels like you're in someone's home.  The tables and chairs look like a collection from a garage sale... mean that in a good way.  There'a a really tiny bar upfront that seats 4 people.  Do NOT miss the tiramisu-- simple sensational.  Canoli was good but was my least favorite part of the meal.  Shell was a little too overcooked for me and found the filling to be good but a little gritty.  All in all easy 4, if not 4.5 stars.  Will be back next time up in the area.,"}
{"text":"On rare occasions I am transported back to Italy--either by the ambiance, the hospitality, or the flavors of a restaurant. Tonight I have had that experience as a result of the hospitality and flavors of Vin Santo. I had the ravioli pasta special and it was wonderful. The decor is somewhat meh, but the food was great. The servers make the cocktails, which seemed odd. I will come back with each visit to Madison..."}
{"text":"Excellent!! This is our second visit and we were glad we went both times. There's very few times you walk away from a place and go 'WOW'. This is that place!  Family run.....and you can tell!"}
{"text":"This little gem is the closest thing we've found in town that reminds us of being back in Tuscany!  Authentic Italian menu was not huge but diverse.  The house lasagna was out of this world, and seafood pasta was delish.  Service was prompt and friendly...tiramisu not traditional not good.  Can't wait to come back!"}
