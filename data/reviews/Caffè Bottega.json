{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered a small coffee and the lady taking my order said that I should probably get the medium size because the small would be too strong. Ok, so they don't adjust the shots according to their sizes of coffee?!?!"}
{"text":"Cold brew Stumptown coffee on tap! Enjoyed with a charcuterie and cheese plate with pesto and olives. Perfect way to kick off my Vegas trip. The barista told me they flew the employees out for training from the Stumptown owner."}
{"text":"The coffee was nice in this cafe but a real shame about the service - or lack of it. We were dining in this cafe, We put our order in for a large cappachino and medium latte in a cup as we were dining in. We were told that they only do the tiny cups and would have to have a paper takeaway cup despite the fact that we were dining in. I requested a muffin to go with it and stayed up the counter to pay. I was totally ignored so went and sat down. Our coffee was brought to is in the takeaway cups but no muffin. When I went up to get sugar etc was asked by the girl if I had my muffin which I replied no. She proceeded to get it and brought it over to where we were sitting having out coffee  in a paper bag!!!!! I asked if I could have it on a plate as were dining in and warned up. This was begrudgingly done. While we were sitting eating the waitress came and told us we should have paid when we ordered. I replied I had been up there twice to pay and was ignored. Good coffee - bad experience !!!! Would not go back there"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there twice. Nothing to complain about. 4/5 because of missing opportunity to sit outside. :-)"}
{"text":"A cozy little getaway within a strip casino. Very comfortable, with a nice mix of intimate tables, couches and stuffed chairs. My server behind the counter could not have been more pleasant, attentive and professional.  I went for coffee, but I was intrigued by the fairly ambitious menu so I ordered the potabello mushroom sandwich, and I was very pleased. The mushrooms had been sauteed and marinated just right so that they had that almost-meat texture that I love about portobello mushrooms. The cheese, sauteed peppers and grilled bread all stepped up their supporting roles to make for a very good sandwich.  The noise and smoke that accompany most casinos wasn't an issue here, as it is just far enough away from the casino floor that I quickly forgot I was in a casino.  I'd say this place is about as good as it can be for a casino coffee shop."}
{"text":"Tuscany casino, nice place, and good coffee here, it does have an Italian feel here, which is nice."}
{"text":"I have to say I've lived here for 11 years and when I think of a cafe In a casino I get nauseous bc they usually are just a \" have to go \" bc it's open 24/7. I was really hungry and had a comp and decided to use it, needless to say I'm here again day 2. I had a omelette with bacon/cheese/onion. Absolutely delicious and the hash browns are perfect and taste amazing. I know it seems simple but I've had some really gross cafe food and this is more than cafe food. Very good!"}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend and ordered a couple panini's. For some reason the panini's took a full 25 minutes to make which was getting pretty frustrating. We could see that basically only ONE employee was making the panini's and he had to make all the customers' panini's basically one at a time as they only had 1 machine to do so and limited space.  To improve the experience, I think the cashier NEEDS to let people know before they pay that \"hey just FYI it's going to be approx an 20 minute wait\" or whatever because us customers do not want to wait that long for a sandwich!!!   Anyways...beyond that .... the paninis were actually very delicious. I enjoyed the bread they used and everything was very tasty.  Please just warn people if your sandwiches are going to take an abnormally long time."}
{"text":"The original source for Stumptown coffee in Vegas- located inside the Tuscany Resort, easiest to find when using the front entrance (it's in the right corner), located near the pool. Hot and cold coffees are available, but the cold brew and Midnight Brew (over ice) are the best choices. There's a limited pastry case and menu of fresh salads, flat bread pizzas, and sandwiches, with a refrigerator case of grab and go options. Service over several visits is not the best, frequently have to clarify and repeat basic orders and drinks have a tendency to be underfilled like an inch from the rim- annoying when a large is only 16oz to begin with."}
{"text":"This cafe was located inside of the hotel/casino so it was kinda nice to have that atmosphere so close. Me and my girlfriend came here just looking for a drink while we were out on the town.   We walked in and started chatting it up with the worker, seeing as there was nobody else in the cafe. He was incredibly nice and helpful. He knew the menu incredibly well. I was legitimately impressed with how well he knew everything and how he could spout all this juts off the top of his head. It takes dedication to get to that point so I admire his persistence.   The reason I am putting it as only a 3 star is because we both ordered a chai tea latte and both of our drinks had very little flavor and were not that great. Neither of us were incredibly impressed with the quality of our drink. I would be willing to try it again but I wouldn't be getting that drink.   Ultimately, don't go out of your way to go here but if you're around go ahead. There are many other places around where you can get a better drink."}
{"text":"Ordered two drinks, ladies were helpful and happy to assist with my 'no-dairy' drink. Love the coffee. Pastries were huge and fresh."}
{"text":"A little pricey but for what it is but quality and nice sized portions. Donuts were huge. I got a egg sausage and cheese sandwich on an English muffin. Very convenient and located right in the Tuscany hotel."}
{"text":"A fantastic little bakery in the Tuscany Resort.  Coffee was excellent, strong but not bitter with a smooth finish.  Bagels, muffins and doughnuts.  There was one chocolate covered doughnut which was about 6-7 inches across ... HUGE it was.  I think the coffee brand was Stumptown coffee.  Haven't had this brand before was liked it a lot.  Even if you are not staying at the Tuscany Resort this is a great place to visit,  about two blocks off the main strip."}
{"text":"My favorite off-strip hidden gem. The Caesar salad is always crisp and the fresh flatbread pizzas are delicious. The homemade potato chips are addictive! Service is friendly, too."}
{"text":"We ate here before a 10 hour trip home.  We stopped by at 6:00 AM and were greeted with very friendly staff.  For 6 AM, we were very appreciative for this happy interaction with the staff.  We ordered some VERY delicious egg and bacon breakfast muffins.  Highly recommended for the yum yum scale.  My son ordered three flat bread chicken pizzas (i know breakfast) but they were delicious and very plentiful.  By plentiful, I mean they did not skimp on the toppings.  I ate a slice and it was awesome!  I highly recommend this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  For our very long trip we ordered a few blue berry muffins and a old fashion doughnut.  They were eaten at the 230 mile marker.  They were also, as expected very delicious!  Excellent service topped with great food.  A must if you are staying here or even traveling out and want a great meal to end your Las Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I come here every weekend because I work at The Spa and I can honestly say that their chicken panini is the best sandwich I've ever had. I had to get on and tell people about it and I'm not even done eating it, it's that good. Their chai tea lattes are really good too! I got my drink before I came into work but when I need the extra caffeine, this cafe is the first place I go to!"}
{"text":"The Stumptown beans are totally decent but the barista hit and miss at best. When trying a place that I'm unsure of I usually order my cappuccino dry as poor baristas tend to kill 2 shots of espresso with too much, too hot, not enough foam steamed milk. Rather than a cappuccino you get a bad latte. So I ordered my cappuccino \"a little dry\" and got 2 shots of espresso with too much, too hot, no foam steamed milk.  20 minutes later I'm still waiting for it to cool to the point where it is at least drinkable, knowing the coffee has been killed by the hot milk. Is Sambalatte the only place in Las Vegas where they know how to make coffee drinks? I suggest just buying the beans to go at Bottega."}
{"text":"I wish i could do a follow up visit but i'm going to give the benefit of doubt to the cafe because three stars is too low but four is a bit high.   The service was good for a walk-up counter coffee shop and my pastry was nice but forgettable. I would like to revisit the coffee though. I had a small cappuccino which came in Italian style, foamy and without latte art. It was not overly foamy and the temperature was acceptable though i would call it on the hot side for a cappuccino. No complaints on the shot though, excellent pull of some Stumptown.  What is going to pull this place down is the sterile hotel lobby interior and elevator music, it feels geared towards conventioners and AARP members. It was very clean on a positive note, i would just advise inquiring about outside seating (also note that there is serious smoke smell wafting in from the casino floor). Also a big plus is the prices are awesome, like cheaper than most neighborhood cafes but with better beans.   I can't say this is worth a cross town trip but if you are staying here or hanging around the LINQ i would recommend a stop by."}
{"text":"Great coffee has finally arrived in Las Vegas.  Caffe Bottega is brewing Stumptown Coffee Roasters coffee, one of the country's finest artisanal coffees.  They do a great job with both the brewed coffee and espresso drinks here.  I love to start out the day here with a cappuccino, a croissant, and a fresh orange juice!  In addition to the great coffee & bakery items, there is a great food menu.  The food menu has paninis, pizzas, salads, charcuterie, etc.  My favorite part of all though is the craft beer selection.  They have an outstanding selection of local craft beers, like Joseph James and Tenaya Creek.  Moreover, they have an amazing selection of Belgians, including my favorite Rochefort.  You'll also find other Trappist beers, Rodenbach Grand Cru, Duvel, and more.  The atmosphere is very warm and inviting.  It's a comfortable atmosphere and there's a nice patio outside as well.  Also, the service is really friendly.  The staff really tries hard and even seem to know some of my preferences.  Best of all, prices are really reasonable.  Caffe Bottega is my new favorite coffee & beer spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing makes this Portland girl happier than finding Stumptown Coffee in Vegas! If you are going to do the late night Vegas adventure, having Stumptown to start is basically just setting yourself up for success! Just a quick detour from the strip, this new café is located in The Tuscany. They have a nice selection of craft beers, wine and even cider on the menu. A totally affordable little foodie nook off the strip, definitely worth the trip, you will save a small fortune by venturing  1/2  mile off the strip. They have a really nice charcuterie board with a great selection of cheese and meat but the duck sausage is the winner on this plate! We also split the veggie board which had my favorite SF Cowgirl Creamery cheese (Barely Buzzed)! If you haven't tried this cheese you must it's rubbed with espresso and lavender, okay it might sound a bit wild but it's delish! The flat bread pizza was also really tasty! And if you can, save room for dessert, giant chocolate chip cookies , lots of pastries and probably one of the best coconut macaroons I've ever had (so soft)! Staff was really friendly and helpful. This will likely be my new Vegas spot when I want some  good food without the strip chaos and price!"}
{"text":"I had a sausage egg & cheese sandwich here for breakfast - it wasn't very good and had a burnt flavor / scent to it. Tried again at lunch (grilled cheese) - same result. The other restaurants were at capacity due the event going on at the time. That said, I brought snacks the next day in self defense. The sandwich machine needs cleaning or replacing. Wouldn't have fed this garbage to my dog."}
{"text":"Cafe shop that serves you smooth coffee. They use stumptown coffee beans from pacific northwest. Pastries are huge and you might want to share. Overall, this is the place to cool off it you don't want to sit by the slots after walk from the strip"}
{"text":"This coffee shop and is located in the Tuscany Resort near the pool area. I stopped in to meet some fellow Yelpers that were staying at this particular hotel. I ordered the Stumptown Cold Brew for me beverage.   The cold brew was okay. It unfortunately had a sourness to it that was hard to avoid. It's funny, even the guy behind the counter warned me about it, but I was set on a cold brew and understood a bit of sour, but not like this. It took a few drinks to get use to, but after a while it grew on me enough to finish it off. I don't think they intended for it to be this sour, so I wonder if it was a bad batch.   Anyways, the service was very good and friendly. They also provide baked goods, craft beers, wine, and some light eats, perfect for enjoying pool side. The WiFi is free, but you have to ask for the password. The have a small amount of comfortable seating inside and an abundance outside near the pool."}
{"text":"Der Chaitea Latte ist sehr schlecht, hat mehr Schaum, als Tea. Das Ambiente und die Bedienung sind mangelhaft."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this spot for a morning cup of coffee. The atmosphere is very pleasant and cozy, and the coffee is very good. There is also a very nice outdoor area that looks right into the pool that has chairs and tables.   Gluten Free: They do not offer any gluten free baked goods, but they do have some gf granola bars and also offer small fruit cups!"}
{"text":"love the stumptown coffee! great croissants too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast and coffee are decent here. Ordered a egg and cheese on English muffin with sausage and a cappuccino. Both are very hot and yummy!! Started my day happy!"}
{"text":"Das kleine Café in Tuscany ist nicht mein Fall, es ist soweit zwar sauber und ordentlich, jedoch abgesehen von den recht teuren Panini (8$) die dann aber doch nur zwei Weizenbrotscheiben sind, war ich weder vom Cappuccino noch vom Chai Tee überzeugt. Die Preise dafür waren ebenfalls hoch, sodass am Ende nur bleibt, dass dieses Kaffee im Haus liegt. Der nächste SB ist jedoch nur einmal quer über die Straße, sodass dieses wohl mein einziger Versuch hier im Bottega bleiben wird. Sehr schade, da die sonstige Gastronomie im Tuscany bisher immer gut war."}
{"text":"Waking up and walking downstairs to this cafe is wonderful. Quaint, and cozy with tables just outsude the door with a perfect view of the pool."}
{"text":"They have a perfect little menu with tons of food for any occasion! I got the cinnamon coffee cake and a mocha. The mocha is delicious and creamy and the coffee cake is a giant piece full of cinnamon! The outdoor seating is in the shade and by the pool. There are lots of cute birds around too."}
{"text":"Stumptown funk you up Stumptown funk you up Say whaaa?!  Cold brew coffee, that's what. Not new news, but Caffé Bottega in the Tuscany Casino is serving Stumptown Coffee Roasters cold brew coffee. After recently visiting the Pacific Northwest, I didn't realize what a strong presence Stumptown coffee had there until I left. Strangely enough, I was on a tea binge at the time and subconsciously avoided coffee altogether (yes, I am looking at you S***bucks). My curiosity for Stumptown brought me on an adventure all the way to the Tuscany Casino.  From the main entrance of Tuscany Casino, go right to an almost hidden cafe. I was immediately enticed by the sweet goodies in the case, which had pastries and donuts. I went with a buttermilk bar (square shaped one) and wow, it was yummy. 5/5  The highly anticipated cold brew, was a bit disappointing. Compared to other places in town, I was not impressed. Cold brew is supposed to have a less acidic and bitter taste. This version was acidic. There were some fruity and floral tones present. I did not finish my drink. 3/5  The baristas were warm, friendly, and helpful.  They do sell Stumptown coffee by the bag for $16."}
{"text":"I stopped drinking starbucks since i found stumptown coffee! They have alot of pastries but i recommend you visit in the morning cause thats when the pastry shelf is fully stocked. I always go for their cold brew."}
{"text":"Stumptown coffee spot located inside the Tuscany Resort...go for the cold brew..."}
{"text":"The Grand Opening featured a beer, soda and coffee tasting, along with food samples. Joseph James brewery reps were on hand with goodies and samples of their chocolate stout and rye brews.  This is a nice little cafe with a selection of craft brews, coffee bevvies and paninis, pizza, salad, etc. A sign advertised homemade potato chips.  The food was very good, I especially liked the pastrami panini and Caesar salad. The Tuscany has a few restaurants to choose from, and without knowing if these also have local brews such as Joseph James, I'd choose the cafe. We had outdoor seating for the party, but that looked temporary as in just for the grand opening."}
