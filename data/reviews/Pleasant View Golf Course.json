{"text":"I'd highly recommend the burgers, can't go wrong as they're made from fresh local beef delivered daily by Knoche's.  

Also, the Friday fish fry is a great value.  For $12.95 you get 3 pieces of fish and fries with either potato salad or slaw.  Wash it down with a cold local craft brew on draft and then head out and play the par 3 course because it's included in the price of your fish fry!  

Great staff and you can't beat the location.  Excellent place to hold a party or other event."}
{"text":"Beautiful course. Much more flexibility than other area courses with 27 regulation holes (in addition to Par 3 Executive course). Great bar & restaurant, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's a nice course, but my review is more for customer service/policy. I've never had issues with rain checks at golf courses before, most places will provide them if the weather is bad without hesitation. We were about halfway through the fifth hole when it started to rain and then heard thunder when we were finishing it up the hole, so we returned to the clubhouse. 

We asked for a rain check and mentioned where we were when the thunder started, and they said that they considered that a \"completed game\". I didn't see anything on the website that indicated that was their policy, and they didn't mention anything beforehand. It certainly didn't feel like a completed game, it felt more like getting ripped off. 

If you go there and feel like you're owed a rain check, make sure you tell them you didn't finish the fifth hole."}
{"text":"27 holes and a nine hole par 3. Nice course, great price!"}
{"text":"By far the absolute worst customer service I have ever seen. Having worked in the golf business for 10 years as golf pro (before switching careers) at much nicer golf courses than this golf course, I cannot imagine ever treating someone the way the golf pro/gm treated us. For a guy stuck working at a mediocre golf course he sure likes to think he is a big deal. I can only imagine how awful he is as a golf instructor with his customer service abilities."}
{"text":"This is a very nice golf course and usually in terrific condition - lots of hills and well placed bunkers. Disregard the comments from the whiners who complained about the staff. Who cares about that - get out there and play golf and quit complaining, you wimps."}
{"text":"My son has been taking golf lessons at Pleasant View and we're very happy with how that's going.  For the money, it's a great deal.  He's found a passion for the sport, and they're doing a great job getting him going.  We're likely to sign up for the second session as the boy just can't get enough!

The 10 \"bonus rounds\" of golf at the par 3 are a nice perk, and the fact that he can share those rounds will get us on the course together and get him more practice.  I highly recommend Pleasant View for their kids' lessons - so far, so great!"}
