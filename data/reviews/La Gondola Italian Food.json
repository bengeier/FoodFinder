{"text":"Excellent pizza at an amazing price. 

We ordered a meat lovers pizza. We tried to get delivery but the lady on the phone told us that it would cost 8 dollars less (than our ten bucks for a large 3 topping!) so we totally drove down there. 

The store is perfectly located and the pizza is delicious, really outstanding. And fast! Our pizza was cooked in under 20 minutes."}
{"text":"LOVE the gondola! 
The owner is so nice, pizza is one of my fave's for a fast food joint. You can't beat the $5 medium special with 2 toppings and $10 large 3 toppings- including tax! 

In terms of actual store front, no frills but the food is great to pick up and take home."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the world. I usually don't go for pizza, but I am always down for La Gondola. Joe and Judy run a tight joint, and treat their customers like family. Pizza is handmade and always fresh. Joe makes his own amazing hot peppers in oil. Almost any toping is available, and the dough is nice and thin. The best part? $5 for a medium two topping. Take that Domino's."}
{"text":"At 2:30AM this is the best pizza you've ever had... Any other time it's generic pizza without much to talk about... it's OK... but with Lemar's just down the street why stop here?"}
