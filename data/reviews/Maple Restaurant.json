{"text":"Great family restaurant! Had the fish sandwhich, and it was huge!! Very tasty. Husband had a burger, and said it was also very good. Very accommodating to families with small children. A little pricy, but a nice place to go if you want to stay local."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since My wife introduced me to it in 1999.  I keep wanting to eat something other than the hot roast beef with fries but I can't. It is just too good. Ask if they have rice pudding if you want a special treat."}
{"text":"When we have friends in town who want local homemade cooking, like hot roast beef, mashed potatoes and a generous side salad; we take them to the Maple Restaurant. Great Food Service and Prices!"}
{"text":"The food is the same tried & true recipes they've been using since they opened in the 60s but its good. They do not deviate from what has worked for decades. Yes the place is very very outdated. There's a few waitresses that make you feel like its an inconvenience to attend to your requests, but most of them are very experienced and knowledgeable and have been working there for many many years. If you want a good meal at a decent price in the Ambridge area, than this is the place to go. Note, if you come on a Friday around 5ish, plan on waiting because the place gets really busy people coming for their Fish."}
{"text":"Any time I am visiting family, I always stop at Maple. While the location is a little sketchy, inside you will find friendly staff, and amazing, hearty food. While they are known for their Hot Roast Beef, my dish of choice is the Fried Haddock with Home Fries. The haddock is some of the best fish I have ever had, fresh and flaky, and perfectly moist. The home fries taste fresh cut, and are large circular cuts of fried potato. I have had some other menu items, like the chicken parm sandwich and mac and cheese, which were both great, but since I only make it to Maple two or three times a year at most, I've gotta get the Haddock when I am there. If you go on Friday though, you've gotta try the jumbo fried shrimp! An unlikely location for amazing seafood!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there's so much love for this place. Someone else described it as \"cafeteria-style food\", and that seems pretty accurate. If you think that school cafeteria food is fantastic, you'll love this place. 

It wasn't awful. The food was plentiful and hot, and the dishes were clean. The fries were hot and crisp, at least in the places that they'd not been left to soak in the gravy. The \"famous\" roast beef wasn't anything special, especially served on supermarket white bread with what tasted like very salty canned gravy. We also got a reuben (my partner and I split two sandwiches) which was ok, but nothing special--the corned beef was nothing more than deli-style corned beef; the swiss cheese was plastic-y tasting. 

We passed on dessert--the meal was both filling and underwhelming enough that we were ready to move on. 

The neighborhood isn't at all threatening, I don't think, but it does seem sketchy--I was panhandled in the parking lot, and that area of Ambridge has a lot of empty storefronts and boarded-up windows. It's not the most inviting area, and I'm certainly sympathetic to people who're left somewhat unsettled by it.

The Maple Restaurant is a local landmark, but I think that at this point, it's more due to nostalgia than it is great food."}
{"text":"I really like this small, local business. The interior is a bit dated but the food is great. The staff is friendly and we never have long for our food. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The gravy is amazing.  Combined with the fries also amazing.  It is an old style diner, they do what they do really well.  Should be more places like it.  Reuben is excellent too.  If you want homestyle cooking it's a lot more satisfying than most places in Pittsburgh in spite of what Pat G. suggests."}
{"text":"There food is sooooooooooooooo good!!!!!!!!! I love there beef and home fries!!!!! Their sevice is good!!"}
{"text":"We both got the signature hot roast beef sandwich.  Very good!  Rice pudding for dessert.  Truthfully we only needed one to share but the server said they were small.  Yes, they're served in a tiny glass bowl but it is stacked very high.  One order would have been enough.  
Need to update the interior."}
{"text":"Best place to get Hot Roast Beef, hands down. I always leave the restaurant super stuffed. They have a great selection of food...but I don't suggest the spaghetti. 

Favorite dishes: Hot Roast Beef with fries (gravy on all), Chicken Parm sandwich, and Chicken Delight Sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars because it's about as good as hometown goodness can get - a true 60's diner experience. 

A Maples roast beef sandwich is something that you have to experience if you live in Pittsburgh - that hot beef with crispy fries and gravy all over is a 'burgh must - so traditional and so damn good.

The servers move fast and get you your meal (and if you're smart a slice of delicious homemade pie and some good 'ol diner coffee) as quickly as possible - so if you want to stop in for a quick bite and some Pittsburgh history - visit Maples - and get a hot beef sandwich :-)"}
{"text":"This local family run business is a step back in time. Friendly service staff and a funky decor make it worth the visit. They specialize in hot beef sandwiches piled high with thinly sliced beef which are then smothered with homemade gravy. All are served with honest to goodness mashed potatoes. A real treat if you love beef! Otherwise there are other options."}
{"text":"Great stuffed pork chops thursday special, I always try but I'm usually too late for 'em.  I made it this time. My great grandkids usually go for the spaghetti which I'm not big on but I love the meatballs so I often  swipe them to take home makes a great lunch for next day. This place is lost in time, nothing changes except for some modernization in the kitchen every so often. The nostalgic  pictures around the cash register area are great, I always seem to find something or someone I haven't noticed before."}
{"text":"A real gem of a place in Ambridge.  The prices were very reasonable and the food was so good.  I had the Chicken Delight and it did not disappoint in any way.  This place has been around for 50+ years and you can see why.  I rather liked the atmosphere too.  Parking is directly across the street."}
{"text":"Loved the hot roast beef sandwich with home made fries. Love going there."}
{"text":"You walk in and its like you are transported back to 1956! Its exactly what  you would expect- you will NOT get farm to table,  ingredients I can not pronounce or spell   or flashy service. What you  will get is old school cafertia food, served by  mostly older grandma type waitresses who  will chat you up, make sure your drinks are refiilled and you leave with a box.

 I would not eat  here all the time but its a great place for ( of course) roast beef with ( gasp*) white bread. The  interior  is all decked  out  with black and white  photos and awards they  won.

 Try it.; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit (but not our last!) to The Maple...I read the reviews about the \"best hot beef sandwich around\" and decided to take a little drive to see if the reviews were right. (As we suspected--they WERE!!!) What a delicious, perfectly cooked and assembled roast beef sandwich! Soooo thinly sliced, tender and stacked high on two soft slices of bread...then smothered in a delicious gravy that closely rivals my dearly departed mom's Sunday roast beef. Seriously, if you are looking for a great hot roast beef sandwich--look no further--the best is here!!! Home made mashed potatoes accompany the flavorful sandwich and we also ordered a side of fresh, homemade coleslaw that was a perfect partner to this meal. As if our stomachs could even hold another morsel--we had to try the home made chocolate pie as well. Very good, smooth and chocolatey with a layer of whipped cream on top. The chocolate syrup drizzled on top wasn't needed, as this pie was flavorful without the addition. More whipped cream would be my choice. Our waitress, Diane, was one of the nicest, friendliest and most helpful waitresses we've encountered in a long time! She gave us great recommendations for our next trip to the Maple. The original owner was there celebrating his 95th(!!!) birthday--a dear man who stopped to say hello as he passed by. God bless him--as our waitress said--\"it must be the gravy that keeps him going\"!!! We'll surely be back soon to this quaint little spot."}
{"text":"I love the history here. I love the fact that the Ambridge community celebrates this place. And I love how it's been family-owned for decades. I just wish I liked the food more than I do. 

Many of the dishes are legitimately tasty (for sandwiches, I always go for the Rachel or Reuben, which are usually really good). But so many dishes are humongous servings of so-so food: giant blobs of overcooked meat, buckets of salt (er, I mean gravy), towers of mushy french fries. I stopped getting their salads when I realized they were an iceberg lettuce delivery system for 15 pounds of french fries and an ocean of dressing. If you like this kind of thing, great! You will LOVE this restaurant. If you don't love this kind of thing (like me), there are plenty of other places nearby that you'll probably like better.

(And yes, I am a local, and yes, I've eaten here much, much more than once.)"}
{"text":"I'm going 5 since I found no fault with our lunch here today. Boy is this place old school! On the back wall above the doors are numbers from 1-9 that light up and make a \"ding\" sound when a server's order is ready. Most of the servers are older and act like loving grandmothers. 

Speaking of LUV, my Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, one of my favorite comfort foods, was awesome. It was served up fast,with rich gravy, great fries, soft white bread, and a smile. YUMMAY! 

I had chocolate cream pie for dessert and it was the best ever. Darren wouldn't let me try his sundae. He said he would but \"forgot.\"  :( Meanie. I'm kidding Sexyman. 

Everyone was so, so friendly here. The dark-haired young girl who rang us out was adorable and complimented me on my purse. I would definitely come back and am glad I bookmarked it.  The neighborhood's just fine too."}
{"text":"Your basic diner food....smothered in delicious gravy and served by pleasant waitresses at a reasonable price.  Lots of homemade desserts too."}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned it's like going into a time warp, but in a nice way. Yes it's very dated but neat and tidy. I barely even looked at the menu because i knew I was getting that hot roast beef sandwich that I had heard so much about. It was everything that I dreamed it would be! a really good amount thin sliced beef on white bread with fries covered in tons of gravy...It was awesome. Others at our table had an alpine burger with Swiss and mushrooms, a Reuben burger with coleslaw, Swiss a and 1000 island dressing, and a ham sandwich with big thick sliced ham. one of the desserts on special was a baklava sundae. Omg are you kidding? I'll try to leave room for it next time. Great diner food and nice friendly waitresses. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in all of Beaver County!  If you go here you must get the roast beef!  It's famous around these parts. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"The 8.99 roast beef with mash potatoe was good, gravy on the side."}
{"text":"I love the Maple!  I have never once had a bad meal here, and I've been a patron for at least 15 years.  The Maple resides in a crotchety old building with gleaming wood all around, a written history of the place on the wall {AND the menus!}, and a bunch of awards all around.  One bad aspect for handicapped diners is that the bathroom in down a long flight of steps to the basement, so...go before you go!  They do not take reservations, and if you're bringing a group, they want everyone there before they seat you...but they've make exceptions for my swim class group a number of times.  I agree with one reviewer that a couple servers aren't very friendly, but I found if I'm friendly with them, they reciprocate a little.  Also, bear in mind that some of these women have been there since God was a child, so they're TIRED!  Serving is VERY hard work!  Ahh, but the food...for straightforward home-style cooking, you can't beat this place!!  From the Famous Roast Beef sandwich or dinner to the fish to the pasta, everything just plain tastes good.  And the pies??  Oh, the pies.  Even if you're too stuffed from your meal {and you likely will be because the portions are huge}, TAKE A PIECE HOME!!  I would crawl over broken glass to get to a piece of their coconut crème!  Seriously, do yourself a favor and try the Maple."}
{"text":"Just a quick update. Maple is still great but I have noticed this past year each time I order the amount of Roast Beef seems to decrease ever so slightly. Food is still great but I removed one star since prices stayed the same but the portion size seemed to decrease slightly.

Still stop by if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write this review for all of the simpletons who don't realize they are visiting a DINER and who believe that they should be offered mescaline greens and free range chicken here.  Spoiler Alert - they are not on the menu.  What is on the menu is great DINER food.  Hot roast beef, homemade pies, fresh cole slaw. outstanding rice pudding.  Not for folks with special diets or who have medical restrictions.  As an added bonus, a friend, who has been in the restaurant business for many years, worked there a few years back.  She said it is the cleanest kitchen she has ever seen in a restaurant!.  For the folks who are driven to critique ever aspect of every business that they visit - you should really temper your comments to the type of establishment you are visiting."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been to The Maple Restaurant and I've lived in Ambridge for about a year and a half now and I regret not coming here earlier, lol. I ordered the Tuesday special, The Baked Meatloaf Dinner and it was amazing and the mashed potatoes where on point! It also had a side of coleslaw   that was also amazing and I'm picky about my slaw, lol. The sweet tea was on point as well. Staff was kind and refills where always there when needed."}
{"text":"First time trying maples. My only regret is that I didn't come here on my first day arriving to Pittsburgh (might have eaten here every day) I didn't even look at the menu other than to read the history behind this amazing restaurant. Had the roast beef sandwich. Absolutely wonderful. Service was terrific. Going back today before we fly home."}
{"text":"Out of the way ... not the swankiest area or joint ... but the roast beef is super legit.  Highly recommend monthly ... and it will be hard for me to try other items on the menu the roast beef is so damn good"}
{"text":"Simple, unassuming, and affordable, but ultimately delicious. 

People come here for their famous hot roast beef sandwich. The dish is incredibly simple. Roast beef placed between to places of plain white bread, fries on the side, and gravy all over, in the traditional local style. Doesn't get more basic than good old meat and potatoes. Everything was very tasty, especially the gravy and the fries. For less than $10, it is very good values. Service was very friendly.

I'm definitely open to coming back. Some of their other dishes looked good too."}
{"text":"Fish is great.  Roast beef sandwich with fries and gravy is excellent.  A classic diner when you are near Ambridge."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the area and read the yelp reviews for this restaurant.  We all ordered their specialty roast beef and it was very good -- not great but good.  The problem with this diner is the service.  Our first server threw down our silver ware and completely ignored us when we said hello.  Luckily she was replaced by another server who was much nicer.  While the food stood up to the test, doubtful I'd come back for the experience."}
{"text":"Charming ambiance. Hearty food at reasonable prices. Get the hot beef sandwich, obviously."}
{"text":"This is a great little family restaurant. The menu contains standard diner fare and the prices are great and the food is delicious. Our server was wonderful and incredibly accommodating to my 2 year old. The decor is straight from the 70's and I loved it. I would've given 5 stars except there really aren't any healthy options on the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, based on the reviews posted and the fact that it has been around for so long.  First time there and I ordered  the Wednesday spaghetti special with meatballs and salad.  The salad was a very generous size with a tomato slice, olives and onions.  Ordered sweet and sour dressing, which was somewhat of a disappointment.  It was a thick, cold, hard to pour goopy mess.  Not the usual consistency I'm used to.  

The biggest disappointment, however, was the spaghetti. Although the meats sauce was tasty, it would have been nice for the spaghetti to have been drained first. Too much water in the bowl underneath the spaghetti which diluted the sauce. The other problem with this dish were the meatballs.  Two large softball sized meatballs that really tasted nasty.  I don't know what they did with them, but after two attempted bites, I couldn't eat any more.  Don't know if they were old or what, but they were definitely not edible.  

Might return to try the hot roast beef sandwich, which they are known for.  Maybe."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Maple Restaurant. I got the Hot Beef Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy all over...wow. I had heard how great this place was but after trying it for myself, I completely understand all of the rave reviews. The service was quick and my waitress was very pleasant. I look forward to eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"Note: Maple Restaurant's parking lot is directly across the street. Street parking is also available if the lot is full. 

Maple Restaurant celebrates its golden anniversary next year, and I certainly wish it enough longevity to earn a 10 carat diamond. 

When you first walk in, you get the impression that this diner has remained in a state of suspended animation since it opened in 1963. Aside from a few young employees, even the help was past middle-age and thus seemed to be profoundly loyal. I overheard one waitress proudly tell a customer that she had been with Maple Restaurant for 17 years. Even before we entered MR and waded through the heavy, thawing snow on quaint Maplewood Avenue (I didn't find it at all 'sketchy') early this bright afternoon, I could tell that WQED's Rick Sebak would have great fun filming a segment here.

Our waitress, who served up our food in mere minutes, fussed over us as if we were her grandchildren, watching happily as we gobbled up plates of comforting chuck wagon victuals. 

Burgundy MR t-shirts, which are worn by the staff and can be purchased by patrons, are emblazoned on the back with \"America's #1 Hot Beef Maker.\" Roast Beef is their staple and can be had in a number of variations. 

Kay loves hot roast beef sandwiches and ordered accordingly. She did let me try the mashed potatoes, and to me they only confirmed that the mashed potatoes  we had last night on a Dad's Pizza (of Beaver Falls)  pierogi pie were in fact instant. MR's mashed spuds were fluffy but not overly so, had just enough lumpiness, and did not have one hint of the aftertaste found with instant synthetic potato flakes; MR's are the real thing, and for that I was grateful. 

I almost ordered a Maple Burger, a burger that has their signature roast beef on it as well as a \"special sauce,\" but our server advised against it, telling me that she \"don't care for that one.\"

Man, I love an honest server.

When I put my finger on Big Charley, she nodded in approval.

\"You're gonna like that one,\" she said with a smile as huge as the clear, blue sky above. 

And like it I did. My only real complaint with the sandwich was that the roast beef got somewhat dry towards the end, but the nicely liquefied cheese, caramelized onions, fresh, beefy tomato, snappin' BBQ sauce, and toasty bun more than made up the difference. The fries that came with it were soft, crisped, bronzed, salted excellence. 

I got a taste of Kay's Chocolate Cream Pie, and found that whipped cream definitely works better than meringue (I'm lookin' at you Dick's Diner of Murrysville), with this sort of dessert. 

I yet again went with a hot fudge brownie sundae, one that MR calls the Maple Sundae (?), and it was up to the same level I have come to expect from such an unheralded treat. The chewy, igneous brownie was buried under vanilla ice cream and a lake of equally decalescent fudge. 

If you're ever hungry when traveling on Route 65, and it's not too late, give Sheetz or Eat 'N Park a pass; try Maple Restaurant instead for a home-cooked, mom/pop change of pace. Let's help keep them in the black and sustain a part of Americana along with it."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time ever a few days ago and what great food for a fair price!     The service was great, staff was friendly and service was good too!   The food came out quick and hot.    I had the hit roast beef, and all I can say about it is YUM!!!  Definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is not in touch with reality. I recall going here as a child for hot roast beef sandwiches so when I came  home recently my mom wanted to go to Maple. This very old and disgustingly nasty woman was our waitress. My mother ordered a hot roast beef and asked for gravy on her French fries. The waitress stood there and said noting so my mom, thinking the woman did not hear her she repeated herself. The waitress looked directly at my mother and
Said \"what makes you think we have to make a special menu for you\". I thought she was kidding but she was serious! Maybe she had dementia, maybe she was a nasty old woman I don't know. But what I can tell you is this actually occurs just as I stated. Its sad and abusive treatment. Shame on you !"}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... The hot roast beef with fries and lots of gravy is wonderful. I always try this dish at other restaurants around the country and none compare to the maple restaurant.  They have adequate parking just across the street and servers are nice with a diner type feel. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a regular place for us to eat. They have one of the best Ruben Sandwiches we've ever eaten! It's the best I've had in years. You should always get gravy with your fries! They breakfast menu is great too. They do get busy but you shouldn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"The Maple is not what it used to be. I know one thing: They never met a piece of meat that they didn't want to overcook. I cannot get a good hamburger there. It is always hard as a rock. I had chicken recently. It was so dry it was practically inedible. No one is teaching the staff how to cook meat. Its too bad really. The Maple was once an incredible place that did everything they did well."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and their famous roast beast sandwich, but was sadly disappointed.

Have you ever really hoped that you came on the wrong day?  That is how I felt...the first time.  The Maple has such a strong reputation that I thought I must have had really bad timing.

Tried twice since, once to get the real deal, and today because I was in the area.  Each time I tried their signature hot beef, each time disappointed.  It's not awful, but pedestrian,  and about equal to any run of the mill hot beef, though way more expensive. 

If you want a hot beef that blows them away, go to the South Side, to a little dump of a place a couple of blocks south of Carson St. Sorry, but the name escapes me."}
{"text":"Perhaps the Maple Restaurant has high reviews simply because it is the Best of What is Available in the area, I get that.  But it's not very good.  I didn't order the signature beef, I ordered another item on the menu, fried haddock.  Everything on the menu should be as good as the beef.  If it isn't, make it better or get it off the menu.  My fish was overcooked, my mashed potatoes were like paste and the gravy tasted like it came from McCormicks.  The cole slaw was tasty but all white and green, throw in some shredded carrots and it will be AOK.
One of the people at my table has Celiac's, gluten intolerant, the Chef worked well with her, that gave you an extra star.
Another at my table got the prestigious roast beef, it was fine but served between two slice of white bread and drenched in brown gravy.  Just looking at it made my cholesterol levels elevate.
\"Oh, the 'mixed greens\" on the salads are a mixture of different colors of iceberg.  Not my lettuce of choice, ever.
Again, the locals flock here, I get that.  Drive a few more miles toward Pittsburgh and taste some good food, for the same price."}
