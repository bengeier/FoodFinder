{"text":"Friendly service and amazing desserts! I had an ice cream sandwich and ginger tea. I got a double chocolate cookie with lemon meringue ice cream, it was delicious! The atmosphere was really cosy too!"}
{"text":"They use spaghetti as coffee stirrers which is insane - just buy spoons. Using food is incredibly wasteful and honestly bizarre. Also they don't have milk or cream out for tea/coffee so you have to ask for it every time which for a cafe seems ridiculous. The other day they had just straight up run out of milk - like you're on Bloor st close the shop for 5 minutes and go buy some milk you make COFFEE!!!! Some of the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced- owner doesn't seem to care at all about the experience for the patron. Unfortunately the cinnamon buns are very good. The butter tarts are funny though and too sweet."}
{"text":"my go to spot for a sweet snack! very friendly/unpretentious, great location (near Lansdowne Subway). My personal faves: carrot cake (the icing is a little bit too sweet for me, but other than that it's perfect), cookies (any kind...seriously, they're all too good) and butter tarts (melt in your mouth delicious)   My only one complaint is that it's cash/credit only."}
{"text":"Discovered it on a walk, the coffee is pretty good, decent but there machine looks like it could use a good cleaning. Had a chocolate ice cream with little chunks of chocolate that was amazing. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Their ice cream cookies are to die for. The coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We stopped in here twice while visiting some friends who live nearby. There isn't much of a sign out front so you could miss it. The first time we had unbelievably good homemade ice cream - the roasted marshmallow ice cream tasted exactly like a marshmallow just pulled off the campfire before you add it to the s'more - I feel qualified to say this because we had s'mores the night before. I had it in a cup with coconut ice cream and some kind of advanced chocolate ice cream. All three were really, really good. The vegans among us had chocolate and raspberry dairy-free ice creams that they said were delicious.  The next day we were having a dinner with a bunch of friends so we bought a bunch of their pastries - I can't remember them all but there were butter tarts, some kind of coconut balls, carrot cake, and several more. Every single one was outstanding (I didn't try them all myself so that information is partially second-hand). The selection of treats they had was impressive.  As you can tell, I really like this place. The treats are fantastic and the people who were working there were very nice to us. There isn't a sign on the storefront, just a chalkboard sandwichboard sign standing in the sidewalk in front and a small marker-on-glass \"sign\" in the alcove near the door. It's right near the corner of Margueretta St., across from RANSACK THE UNIVERSE."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great spot to hang with friends or come alone to relax.  The espresso is great and mocha's - AMAZING.  There's always a bunch of baked goods to choose from.  Love everything. Great prices and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill with a coffee and some great baked goods.  I was really pleased to discover that they're open later than most of the cafes in the neighborhood - a definite bonus."}
{"text":"This place is opened by one of the guys who co-owns Bakerbots. It felt Bakerbots-like the moment I walked in. Tried their burnt marshmellow and espresso ice cream on white chocolate macadamia nuts. Their ice cream was excellent. Deliciously creamy and flavour was accurate. Similar to Bakerbots and bang bang, their cookies are always harder than they look. I'm always disappointed when I bite into the cookie. It's not to say their cookies aren't good, they're just too hard for an ice cream sandwich. One star docked there. Where I dock another star is that all the delicious baked goods are all displayed on the counter with no sneeze guards. Seeing that people say their orders over the counter where all the food is displayed, I have no doubt that customers' spit droplets have probably inadvertently fallen on the goods. Not to mention with the door wide open, gusts of wind and debris have probably flown in and landed on the food. Not cool. I'm sure the food is delicious but please keep them protected!"}
{"text":"Delicious.. We need baked bread in this hood hopefully they start baking bread products!,,"}
{"text":"Forget bang bang - this is the best ice cream sandwich in the city. The vegan cookies are INSANELY GOOD.  Vegan ice cream is great too and I'm not even vegan.  Their other ice creams are so creamy and delicious too.  Go there. Now"}
{"text":"Home definitely has good shit. I would have given them a 4 star rating if my guard didn't have to go up every time I've been served. I feel a bit like a nuisance. That's the vibe I've gotten from more than one of the girls, unfortunately. I struggle with the decision to go back because of this."}
{"text":"I love hot summer days in Toronto when I can cool down with ice cream! Home bakery has delicious all-natural ingredient baked goods and ice cream sandwiches made with their own cookies.  The burnt marshmallow ice cream is super popular! There are different types of fresh-baked cookies, including vegan and gluten-free options.  I enjoyed my ice cream sammy, it was creamy, sweet, crunchy awesome. I couldn't help myself and bought a lemon tart as well!    Definitely, stop by this cute bakery if you are in the neighborhood.   Leave room for dessert - or a few! :)"}
{"text":"I wish Home was my home - really.   The first time I had an ice cream and cookie sandwich was back when Bakerbots just opened. I was hooked. So when Home opened, one of the few late night bakeries in the area, I was excited! One of the masterminds behind Bakerbots is the same owner of Home so I knew I would have no concerns of their baked goods. And the fact that it's open late means I can work and enjoy ice cream into the late evening which I am most focused.  At $4 a half sandwich, it's one of the cheapest in the city and tastes just as good if not better. My favourite ice cream sammie combination is the mint chocolate and dark chocolate cookie. They just compliment each other so well.   I have yet to try anything else, but I'm sure I will eventually.   Home is a very kid friendly place. It's typically quiet and there are never really lines. During the summers, there are a couple of chairs for outdoor seating."}
{"text":"A really cute dessert Cafe on bloor and Landsdown! The space is really pretty and cozy! We went in and ordered an ice cream sandwich! U can customize ur sandwich with the type of ice cream and cookies that u want! They have 5 different cookies and a good number of Ice cream flavours! We ordered the cookies and cream ice cream sandwich with a chocolate cookie on one side and a macadamia on the other! I personally would preferred the chocolate!   The cookies were freshly baked In house which i liked! Nothing special with the service!"}
{"text":"Well it's about time I write a review for home. I've been here at least a dozen times since I discovered them back in March (thanks to a quick yelp search for carrot cake!).   This place is super cute and cozy and is aptly named since it kinda feels like home. All baked goods are laid out on the counter (which I suppose some people don't like as they appreciate the items being kept behind a glass case) but I don't mind it at all. It makes it feel more like, well, home and it's very enticing to have it all right in front of you. There are about 4 or 5 small tables and it's the perfect place for people watching, both inside and outside the shop.  Now onto the most important part - the food. Everything I've tasted here is amazing! I've had the cookies (my favourite is the spicy ginger), many-a-slice of carrot cake (although i have to agree with my fellow yelper - i'd love more icing!), cinnamon buns, and several flavours of ice cream (lemon meringue, hello!). No matter what you choose, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I believe they also have a couple gluten-free and vegan treats, which isn't quite my jam, but it might be yours.  Service is always friendly. Cash or credit only.   Love it! There's no place like home."}
{"text":"A little birdie told me, the cookies are to salivate for. At $1.50 each, you get fresh made cookies the size of a women's size S palm. Which is still pretty decent size.  I tried 2 different cookies: Ginger snap and oatmeal raisin.  After I took a bite of the ginger, I quickly walked back in to get a few more.  Don't disappoint yourself by missing out. Buy those Ginger cookies."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some bomb coffee and delicious pastries, this is the place to come. My friends and I frequent this cafe weekly just before our Makeden sewing class next door. And it's become a favorite part of our routine. Their coffees are strong and pastries are decadent. We try something new and every time we visit. Their service does tend to be slow as there's always only one person working the till and making the coffees. Plus, no debit-just cash and credit which can be super annoying."}
{"text":"Seriously a hidden gem.   I can't believe I've lived across this beauty for the past year, and only discovering it now.   After trying out all the 'top' ice cream sammies joints last summer, I was convinced nothing could beat Baker's Bot. Alas, there's Home! Ironically, co-owned by the peeps of Baker's Bot. Not to mention, righttttt across the street. #Winning!  The given name 'Home' suits the establishment very well. It's a warm, cozy, 'home-y' joint. (how clever, I know)   The smell of their cakes and goodies baked from scratch, fills the entire room. You can't help but want to buy a bit of everything. Along with their unique teas, and espressos.  For the home made icecreams, flavours consisted of: lemon meringue, sweet cream, peanut butter & jelly, cinnamon, French mint, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, strawberry, burnt marshmallow, and diary-free raspberry. The ice cream sandwiches are priced at $4/half, $7/full.  Make note, their cakes are also available to order! Subject to 3 days advance notice.   Definitely worth a visit if you're in the Bloordale area."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new. They have a lot of desert croissant ... and it all look wonderful. I empty my plate to fast to take a picture lol !! You should stop by !"}
{"text":"They also take credit cards as well as cash. I've been to this place almost weekly since finding it. On the last visit I tried the lemon meringue pie ice cream and holy smokes. Great way to cool off on a warm day.   **one of the always friendly staff told me they have purchased their own ice cream maker and will soon be serving Home-made cold goodness**"}
{"text":"Purposely sought this place out and was not disappointed. I tried the dairy-free chocolate ice cream sandwich and was reluctant to even share it with my loved ones. Freshly baked cookies and mouth watering gelato taste. They were sold out of carrot cake but the 5 cookie flavours I got were enough to calm my sweet tooth for the week. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I am used to drooling over all the buttery, dairy-filled treats that I can't (well, shouldn't) have but... Wow, I am pleasantly surprised that the vegan cookie I had (one of limited vegan options present) was not a humdrum, oh-let's-throw-a-pity-bone-to-the-herbivores kind, but a real, gooey and flavourful treat that wasn't overly sweet. I sincerely hope there will be more vegan options down the road!"}
{"text":"This place has become a regular for me. As an avid coffee drinker, I can definitely vouch for the coffee quality here. Their macadamia cookies have definitely won the love of my stomach as well."}
{"text":"This is the new place opened by Chris Stopa, the co-owner of Bakerbots (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bakerbots-baking-toronto). Ice cream sandwiches are same deal as bakerbots (although I think a bit less expensive), but with different types of cookies and ice cream flavours. Chris is a super awesome guy - always great to chat with. For a great review and more info see http://www.blogto.com/bakery/home-toronto.  PS: try the buttertarts, they are amazing."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend as we were walking by and had to stop in at the site of ice cream.  It was such a great atmosphere with dim lights and seating for two's.  The place is owned by the owners of Bakerbots.  I was a bit hesitant to eat her as I have an allergy to peanuts and saw peanut butter cookies and ice cream.  The lady working there assured me that they wash the scooper each time (I just hope that each worker here is that diligent).  So I tried the Espresso and Burnt Marshmallow.  Love the ice cream flavours and the taste - so creamy, so tasty - tastes with full flavour and intensity!  The price was great too!  I didn't try their cookies though as I was too hesitant with the peanut allergy...not to mention the cookies were right where people ordered, exchanged money and the cookies were exposed - no covers!  I was definitely turned off by that.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"Great, laid-back vibe. Friendly staff, plus earl grey soft serve!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had a half ice cream sandwhich with a soft ginger cookie and their burnt marshmallow ice cream and a americano. It was on point!  The vibe inside is great and chill and the music is awesome.  These guys are not fucking around, their deserts are killer.   My only issue is I wish the seating was more comfortable. Save the front window bench (best seating in the house imo) Bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Very cold/bad customer service. You'd ask a question about an item on the menu and he'd reply with a semi brag and then tell you that it's sold out. No list for available coffee. and when you ask about the options he'd reply with \"choose whatever\".  Seems very disinterested in customers, and when we tipped him almost 25% (yeah, i know) he didn't even utter a simple thank you. Just a poker face a la \"why are you still here\". It seems like the positive reviews are from family and friends, cuz this was not a nice place.  The coffee we did get was good though.   If kind service isn't that much of an important factor to you, hit it up. Otherwise, there are plenty of decent and better places to go to."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service. They make you feel stupid and unwelcome. Cakes are good but not as good as so many other bakeries in Toronto and you get friendlier service. They are also pricey. It's alright, but spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I'm being completely honest, i was on my way to Brock Sandwich to get the pulled pork sandwich but I saw a HUGE rat corpse at Bloor and Emerson. Apparently the rat was going north on Emerson and the car made a bad turn.  The lower body was still fully  in tact and I decided that I didn't crave pulled pork anymore.-- I was instantly delivert after viewing that pulled rat mess..ew  So  I went to Home and I got a ginger cookie, carrot cake and a coffee--basically as much food as possible and pretended it was for me and my friend (I got two forks even).  Thanks to divine timing, a fresh carrot cake had just come out...praise be. I absolutely cannot wait to see some gingerbread treats and eggnog related items.  I'm gaining weight cuz of them ginger cookies but I wont fat shame myself by feeling bad and I'm not gonna stop eating either.  5 stars."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Great atmosphere, and for a big slice of carrot cake that was made the night previous, still delicious and moist. Must try."}
{"text":"New business in the bloordale area. I think the owner used to be at Bakerbots. Really great decor, friendly staff, and their baked goods is delicious. Had their pecan tart and london fog ice cream sandwich with ginger cookie - both amazing. First time i went, had their carrot cake and while good, was just a tad sweet for me. Will be a regular visitor for sure"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place to get some coffee. The staff are always nice and friendly. They have tons of baked goods like cookies, cake, pie -- all temptingly on display like a spread. They appear to have ice cream as well, so this place will likely be a go-to destination once summer comes back.  Americano is always delicious. I've not tried any of the other options, but I'm usually just a straight-up coffee guy and they make it well. Oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate chip cookies are always on point as well.  Welcoming atmosphere, chill vibes, and great coffee!"}
{"text":"After a comprehensive search throughout the GTA, I'm happy to announce that.... DRUMROLL please.... Home is HOME to the BEST CINNAMON BUN in Toronto. The best. Indisputable. It is the winner. I have tried cinnamon buns all over TO, I have walked/biked/driven wayyyy out of my way on just a rumour of there maybe being cinnamon buns, I have spent hours of my time and lots of my $$$ in pursuit of soft warm cinnamon-y goodness. And it's at Home Baking Co where I found it. It's perfect. The dough is amazing, perfectly matched with the buttery, cinnamon-y ooey gooey goodness. It's perfectly baked, not too hard, not too soft. There isn't too much icing, it's the perfect amount. It's perfectly balanced between sweet and cinnamon-y and buttery - not too sweet, not cloying, and perfectly home baked flavor - it doesn't taste manufactured or chemically in any way, it tastes likes someone baked it with love. It's big enough to split and be satisfying for two people, but it's not too big it you want to finish it yourself. One caveat: This type of goodness takes time. They don't make these before they open, so this cinnamon bun is not be available first thing when Home opens, and they open kind of late for a bakery as it is (11am). They maybe start making them when they open or later... and then they are made from scratch, so they make dough, the dough has to rise, this all takes time. On average, I think cinnamon buns are usually available starting at around 1:30pm, and they are often sold-out by 3pm. So check their website and their FB and their twitter or call ahead or do whatever you need to do to guarantee your claim to one of these awesome cinnamon buns. If you go there, there's a lovely girl named Lindsay behind the counter sometimes, and if the buns aren't ready yet she will put one aside for you when they are ready so you can pick up later. That, my friends, is real service, no doubt about it. Home also sometimes has day old buns that Lindsay will heat up for you - go ahead and do that, day old is ok with these bad boys. And enjoy. Because it's the BEST CINNAMON BUN IN THE WHOLE CITY FOR REAL.  PS. I've also had coffee, cookies, cake, ice cream sandwiches, and even gluten free junk here and it's all BOMB. Just buy everything they make, pronto. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is one of my favorite phatenning treatery but lately they hired this new twit gurl who sliced me the stingiest slice of carrot cake.  Also I've noticed that they started putting a lot less icing on the cake which is super dissappointing.  :^( hope they change back"}
{"text":"The baked goods were awesome.  I had pumpkin pie and the cinnamon bun.  However, their beverage selection is terrible.  No beer, no coke, no bottled water.  The latte was good."}
{"text":"If not for the occasionally terrible customer service, this place is a dream come true.   But why are people who work in dessert places always so miserable?"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this coffee shop!!! Despite closing in 25 minutes barista let my 5 friends and I stay for an extra 25 minutes as he was cleaning up.  Baked goods are to die for - we had the chocolate chip cookie and chocolate cupcake with cream cheese icing - delicious!! So fresh and honestly amazing.  Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is nice, there is always amazing treats (like ridiculous - earl grey soft serve, WHAT!) and the coffee is great. About 10 tables, room to work, free wifi. They have ice cream sandwiches too with scooped ice cream and there delicious cookies. Nothing but good things for home (sweet home)."}
{"text":"Passed by a few times not knowing this bakery exists, there was no storefront signage but only a minimalistic house-shaped white cutout on the window display. They sell a few cookies and pastries inside. Cookie ice cream sandwich is delicious here! I had a mint chocolate ice cream in a chocolate chip cookie. Get a full one to split with someone, it's a better deal and half an ice cream sandwich would fill you up. The serving size is good here."}
{"text":"In warmer weather, one would be branded a fool for not going with the obvious choice of Home's ice cream sandwiches made with freshly baked cookies. The toasted marshmallow flavoured ice cream is heavenly. There are usually at least six choices of cookies to choose from. Oh, sweet summer time.  Don't fret just yet just cause it's cold outside though. When the weather drops, see it as an opportunity to wild out on the rest of the delicious baked and steeped offerings on the menu.  Carrot cake is as good as apple pie, but truth be told, I am hooked on their banana cream pudding. When I'm not eating it, I am thinking or dreaming about it. Served in take away coffee cups, the regular ($4) is a lovely post meal dessert. The large ($6.50) is fit for sharing or one of those dessert for lunch days, which should happen about once a week if you know what's best for you."}
{"text":"Was walking along Bloor between Dufferin and Lansdowne a week ago. Decided to drop in as this place looked so cute from the outside. They make their baked goods from scratch.  I had the butter tart and an iced vanilla latte.   I opted for the butter tart with no raisins. I wouldn't say it was good. It was ok. I was craving something sweet and it hit the spot. The filling was a bit runny.  The iced vanilla latte was ok as well.  I may drop in if I am in the area. Apparently they are open till 8 pm everyday. They also make ice cream and gelato."}
{"text":"I really like the pastries at Home but I have to say the customer service is unimaginably rude. Out of the 6 or so times I have been here only once was I treated by someone that didn't hate their life.  A charming gentleman was more than engaging and helpful but that's where it ends.  On my first visit the lady behind the counter stood with her back to me for almost 3 solid minutes. When she turned around she just stared at me. I tried to ask about flavors of certain things etc and she could not have been more disinterested in her job. This was a consistent theme for every subsequent visit where the women behind the counter acted as those patrons were non existent and even a bother. I'm starting to think its the company culture here to hate the happiness of others. And it wasn't just me.  I noticed the effort in which our said counter attendant had to stifle a smile with the people ahead of me. On my last and final visit I tried to be honey comb sweet to no avail. Questions are answered with frustration or with the minimum amount of language possible. Blank stares and disgruntled overtones aren't worth the really good ice cream here, anymore."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is phenomenal. Worth the trek from wherever you are in the city. You can't go wrong with any of the baked goods. Always fresh and balanced. Never too sweet. Plan to have a treat while you're there AND bring a box of mixed treats home to share. Also, the baristas make a consistently good cup."}
{"text":"The ice cream sandwiches here have good soft cookies and the bread-pudding type of pastry is delicious, but I have been here a few times now and the customer service has been consistently bad."}
{"text":"Neat little cafe and everyone is happy and cheery! Hands down the best white chocolate hazelnut cookies and their burnt marshmallow ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream sandwich ever!!! Burnt Marshmallow ice cream is the BEST"}
{"text":"Just unexpectedly good. Everything looks amazing and tastes even better. Friendly service in a cozy environment."}
{"text":"My advice: only bring enough cash to cover what you came in to buy. Because if you don't, YOU WILL SPEND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE ON COOKIES.   I learned my lesson the hard way when I wandered into Home Baking Co. one rainy afternoon. It's a warm and inviting little shop, with tables, cushioned benches, and twinkle-lights across the white granite countertops. Countertops lined with beautifully-made, delicious treats.    Their baked good offerings change every day, so don't expect your favorites to be there on each visit. The cookies are there every day though, and for me, that's all that matters. HBC's cookies are the perfect amount of undercooked gooeyness, with crispy, chewy edges and....yeah, you get the picture. I tried the black pepper ginger and the chocolate chip sea salt, both of which were delicious. They have a pretty solid selection, including a few gluten-free options.  I also tried a slice of their pear frangipane tart, which was just okay. Not mediocre enough to deter me from coming back!"}
{"text":"I love how they bake right there before you. It adds to the experience. Ask about the photo hung by the window. It's sweet story too. Although it's a small space, it's a very cozy one. If you're lucky, you'll get the spot by the window! And you can stay as long as you want, even work on your laptop. But I like it best when it's just me against their sweet desserts and lovely tea. My favorite is simply their cookies! There is something about those cookies."}
