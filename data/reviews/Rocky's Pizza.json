{"text":"The wings with \"barbalo\" sauce were great. I tried a slice of pizza and it was just okay for me. I'm a Chicagoan so I'm hard to please in that department."}
{"text":"They have a decent looking menu but after ordering from here twice and having it be expensive and subpar, we will not be ordering again. Specifically: meatball appetizer was very bad. Meatballs were tough and sauce tasted like tomato paste- super tart, acidic- ugh. Ham sub was fine but too salty. Pizza did not have the right ingredients on it so that was disappointing. Garlic cheese bread tasted ok but was very very green under the cheese. Could be herb spread of some kind but it made us wonder what we were eating. Delivery was timely both times- they did well on that. Need to work on the food."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special slice of cheese pizza and soft drink.  It was good I was able to fold it in half and eat it. The cheese just melted in my mouth. It was a good serving size too.  Service was good too.  

Will have to try the pasta dish next time."}
{"text":"For some odd reason I haven't given this place a shot...until now. Wow - it's pretty darn good. We ordered a large pizza and some extra crispy wings. Everything was delicious!  This will be my new go-to pizza place in Huntersville. Oh, the sausage is killer!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Chef must be a genius. Everything is delicious and delightful. My favorite in the area food and service excellent. Kudos to G (chef)"}
{"text":"I've visited here a few times. The food is great but the guy behind the counter is rude and unhelpful. We Will think twice before spending money with this place again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The pricing for pizza is a little high, given that there is a large amount of pizza places in the area, but in general, it was a great experience. 

The staff was very kind, considerate, and helpful. They have great discounts, a great atmosphere, and good food!"}
{"text":"We are having a birthday party, and the guys from Bailey MIddle School claim this is the best pizza in town! So that is what we are doing!"}
{"text":"Average pizza for high prices. It satisfies a craving when I am wanting pizza for lunch, but unless you want just cheese pizza, be prepared to spend $10.00 +for two slices and a drink by the time they nickel and dime you on each little part. There are other pizza options in Huntersville that offer the same quality, in larger quantity and for lower money."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and the restaurant was nice on the inside. The only thing was we ordered garlic knots and what came out was cold Walmart dinner rolls with garlic and oil brushed on top. They were gross, I can't believe any place would pass those off for garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. ordered supreme, very few meat toppings. Would not recommend. Garlic knots were better but just ok."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last 6 weeks. BEST pizza in Charlotte hands down! Great customer service, great Quality ingredients. Would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Really nice old school Italian restaurant. Italian wedding soup was light with nice flavor. Gnocchi  ideal consistency. Marinara sauce was excellent & very unique. Great service."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!! This is great New York style pizza. All ingredients are fresh and everything is handmade! I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy pizza for the fresh toppings, tangy sauce, real cheese all on a great crust then you will enjoy pizza here. Have been here four times now and we can't get enough of the Supremo pizza. ;) .. Unless we ordered a large! Not packed on Friday or Saturday nights YET.. So it's a great place to go if you're in a hurry too. Hand tossed and made perfect. Now I am going to have to go tonight after thinking about it for this review!"}
{"text":"The place is new so I am cutting them some slack here.  Like other Yelpers I noticed there was a deer in the headlights look on some of the staff.  

I ordered a pizza over the phone for pick up and was told 20 minutes.  I got there in 25 minutes and waited another 10, so 35 total, 15 minutes late.  I can live with that for a brand new place.  The funny part was when it was ready one of the staff brought it to me on a pan like I was dinning in.  Eventually I got a box and my pizza 40 minutes later.

The good.  The pizza was very good.  I will try again.  I can't imagine opening a new place is easy."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best in Huntersville, the decor is cool inside.  I wish they had \"delivery\" I know they'd  do much more business that way.  The only complaint I have is last time we went in there the service was a little slow and it was empty.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, and my husband some sort of melted sandwich.  It hasn't been that long on other days so maybe they were just off that day.  Overall I love their pizza and will be a reoccurring customer.  I really especially liked the pizza crust, it was yummy."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenally good. Real, fresh, perfectly composed pizza. We passed by many times before giving it a try but this may now be the only place we go. So pleased!"}
{"text":"We were just passing through but if we lived here this would be our spot! Great customer service and delicious pizza. We will be back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavors and recipes! This pizza joint will leave you wanting more! Try the garlic knots. They are incredible. I love their marinara. So authentic and full of flavor. I asked for extra just to dip my pizza into it! We had the supreme pizza and it was delicious. I would recommend trying one of their gourmet recipes! Some even have cappicola and prosciutto. You can't go wrong! The pizza is hot, flavorful, and a slice of Little Italy! Manga!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but alas, I do not.  I went there on 2 different occasions and found the pizza to be just okay but very over priced.  I ordered the Margherita pizza and it was a huge disappointment.  It was small, mostly just crust and lacking in everything.  Not to mention that it was $12 for a personal sized pizza with no meat!  I often get the Margherita pizza from Brickhouse in Davidson for lunch since my office is nearby.  It is first rate, delicious and costs $7.95 at lunch for the same size that Rocky's charged me $12 for."}
{"text":"Terrible service, they missed my wife's meal, then 3 different people said they'd bring it to our table, but the bitchy little girl calling the orders didn't seem to care, the younger guy making pizza was nice and apologized but the airhead taking orders and the little girl calling the orders out are useless"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to stop and eat here. The food was okay. For a fellow pizza foodie, I have a love for some GREAT pizza but this just wasn't what I would expect it to be. I loved the mozzarella sticks and side salad, but the pizza was just okay. Great, friendly service!!!!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel next door and decided on pizza to go for the family. We ordered three different pizzas (sizes and toppings), cooked extra-well. All the pizzas were excellent and better than our favorite pizza joint back home! Great and friendly service, clean, and fast! We tried the jalape√±o poppers and fries, which were also good. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for NY style pizza with lots of topping options, and friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were anxiously awaiting Rockys pizza opening because we both love pizza and hadn't found a GREAT pizza place around huntersville.  We had stopped by a few weeks before to get a to-go menu and were greeting by a very friendly staff.  

The menu had many delicious sounding options but today we decided on pizza. We both have very different tastes, but all of the pizzas sounded awesome to both of us.  Today we decided to give a Rockys a try.  I decided on \"The Bianco\" and my boyfriend decided on the \"Rocky Reinto\".  We were happily surprised that they would spilt the pizza as get half Bianco and half Reinto.  We got the pizza to go and it was ready when we arrived.  On the way back to the house we noticed how great the pizza smelled, we could not wait to get back and try it!  We were elated that the pizza was soooo good.  The crust was thin & crispy,  not soggy at all.  The ingredients on the pizza were fresh and very flavorful.  We really liked the artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes and garlic infused olive oil.  Can't wait to return and try more things off the menu.  The paninis and calzones look great.  So happy this local place is around !"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Most unorganized staff I've ever dealt with. Rudest manager I've ever spoken to. Definitely do not recommend going here unless you have two hours to waste. Sad because I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"This was one of my \"go to\" pizza joints when the wife and I lived on Keystone. Pizza was always ready on time. I really liked the pepperoni they used."}
{"text":"I am a self-proclaimed 'pizza-snob' living/working in NYC for years.   I stopped in on a Sunday with my boys and we split a large pie.   Must say it was absolutely delicious.  Unquestionably some of the best pizza in the LKN/CLT area for sure.   Would put it up against some of the best.   Please support this place as we locals can ill-afford for this place to go out of business.   Go try a pie, you won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food was hot and tasted great. Definitely will be coming back. Buffalo chicken sub was a hit. It had such great flavor."}
{"text":"Sorry but the pizza is sub par.  It had that typical thick cakey Cleveland crust.  We ordered the garlic bread which sucked.  A him of garlic and a. Dried roll. Forget this place it just sucks add in the exit read thT is an old middle ashes lady on her last leg tjT can barely keep up.   I would definately go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Great place if you are looking for authentic New York style pizza. Being from NY I am very picky about my pizza and this is the only place I will ever get pizza from. Great atmosphere and the people are very welcoming and friendly.  Great prices very reasonable for fantastic food."}
{"text":"When I arrived my pizza was coming out of the oven and looked and smelled very good!  I was then informed that Rocky's forgot it is the 21st century and only takes CASH! (Of which I had none)  I was then informed that an ATM was available next door.  I politely let the older lady working know that I was not going to pay a 5 dollar service fee for a 10 dollar pizza.  She was unhappy, so was I.  Try joining the rest of the civilized world and take my card!!!! Perhaps then I will try again."}
{"text":"Had a coupon so I ordered for pick up.  The place was very dark inside and tiny.  The guy at the counter was nice and friendly.  The pizza I got was with pineapple and ham.  What I thought had been medium pizza's are actually their larges.  Their pizzas run on the small side.  I enjoyed the pizza, but my mom did not really like their red sauce.  The price was good with the coupon, but without one I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad! Not the best I've had. Huge slices!

The slices are almost two in one for how big they are. The place was clean. Decor was nice and simple red and black. Probably wouldn't come out of my way to go here again, but would eat it again if hungry and in the area. 

The lunch special was an awesome deal. Two slices and a fountain drink for somewhere around $6."}
{"text":"Returning to Rocky's is like going home, you get treated like old friends and the food is good. Try the seafood pizza, my kids love it and it's now their go-to order."}
{"text":"Rocky loves Emily and Elizabeth love Rocky's!  The pizza is fantastic, and I love that they cut it into 16ths.  My personal favorite is the caramelized onion, it's delicious.  It says a lot about the pizza at Rocky's that I'm giving them a 4 star review considering their meatball parm hero is a meal I may add to my '5 Worst Things I've Ever Eaten List'- just awful.  It says a lot about a meal when you're trying to be conservative with your money and you won't even save the leftovers.  Stick to the pizza and you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time and was very impressed. We had the Hawaiian pizza and teriyaki wings. They made the pizza right there and then and it was really good!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are nothing to write home about, but with a delicious pizza (we tried the pepperoni) and an interesting decor I'd say its worth a visit."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza crust is one of the best I've had. Light and crispy. The wings were also a nice size and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Ordered buffalo chicken sub, salad, and zeppoli for desert. Sandwich and salad were alright. Zeppoli was not good...they had so much cinnamon that they appeared to be burnt...they weren't...just smothered in cinnamon"}
{"text":"A step above all the chain pizza in the area.  Its nice to see something a little different.  Easy to access location, but the sign looks curiously quite like a Jimmy John's sign.

It seems like they're known for their specialty pies.  I've had the white pie(bianco) and the house.  The white pie is pretty straight forward.  Lots of ricotta though.  The house pie had sausage and eggplant with a balsamic glaze.  Loved the crust on both.

I've only taken it to go, so I have no comments on the service.  The guys working their looked like your average pizza guys.

I'll be back, I have to try that pulled pork pizza.  We'll see if that pie pumps this place up to a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"I brought my mother here since we had not been there in ages.   The first person to help us was very polite and attentive.   His shift ended and we were left with a younger man to help us.   Which he never did. he must have looked at our table about six or seven times but never offered assistance.   After about ten minutes I ended up having to get up and go to the counter to pay my check and get a box for the remainder of our food (a Styrofoam box to stuff half an XL pizza in).  Good service like I started off getting might have left a better impression of the food, but it was average pizza with barely any sauce"}
{"text":"1st timer... The crust was soft & limp. 1st impression was disappointing! Not too sure if I'll give them a 2nd chance!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Most authentic NY pizza in the area, owner is from Brooklyn! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We created a Barbello (buffalo chicken and BBQ) pizza by mixing two of their menu items. It was great!! We also tried the jalape√±o poppers, those were delicious as well. By far our favorite pizza place in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me to write because the food is great!

On a Friday evening I had a pizza delivered to my place of employment for me to take home. After well over an hour of waiting, I finally called, and was told my pizza would arrive any second. After another 15 minutes, the delivery driver came and since there was already a $3 delivery charge on a late/cold pizza I gave him a $2 tip. He then proceeded to berate me in my place of employment for not giving him a better tip, saying he was a third party vendor and had nothing to do with delivery times. I let him know that if he was going to curse at me he needed to leave the premises. So he leaves and comes back a minute or two later accusing me of stealing his pen and then ripped up my receipt in my face. 

I attempted to email Rockys from their contact email on their webpage and never heard back.

Smh. Never again!"}
{"text":"Solid italian joint in the middle of Parma. I'm looking for my baby because I have to have my car fixed at Kurak's. Where is my baby? I'm chomping this stromboli and my baby said I eat too much and now an aloof lover. Kurak's has Marco's Pizza for lunch yet I am eating Rocky's and I'm am tired of the pain and misery of my baby who has impressionable stupidity at every last turn lately. I wanted to take the old man's pair of shoes in bathroom and start whack-a-mole."}
{"text":"Fast service, and great pizza. I was pleasantly surprised how fresh the ingredients were. We ordered the Supremo, which I could tell had fresh mushrooms and peppers. They also serve beer which is a plus. I wish they had a better beer selection, but it's a start. Overall, a good experience. I would go back!"}
{"text":"The owner Paul is a super nice guy from Rochester NY and knows how to make NY style thin crust pizza. The garlic knots are delicious and the sauce is on point! Hey don't skimp on the toppings either! Great pizza and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Clean rstaurant with plenty of seating.  We ordered at the counter and had our food brought out. The dinner salad was good and served on a proper plate although we had to use plastic forks. The pasta chicken was franky terrible. Undercooked pasta and likely out of the jar alfredo sauce. The lasagna was good, but was served in a takeout tin. Not sure if it wasfrozen or not and of course plastic fork. Stick to thier pizza."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from Rocky's and the food is excellent! No complaints! Pretty large portions and great pricing. Sauce is delicious and everything always arrives hot upon delivery. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The key to an outstanding pizza is the crust....Rocky ' s has very fresh ingredients,  but the crust was soggy at the tip & too hard (not edible) at the end.

Disappointed"}
{"text":"I'm the only one in the restaurant. I hear employees in the back cursing. Throwing the F bomb does sit very well. Caesar salad served in China with plastics silver ware. Panini served without the side.
It has a decent taste. Side coming out last.
Not very impressed."}
{"text":"The facility and the staff are first rate; Customer facing, polite, knowledgeable, personable and \"on it\". However, I've eaten here two nights in a row as its next to my hotel and the food didn't blow me away. Not a negative review, just not screaming from the rooftops.

I would describe My pizza the first night as good but not great (for my particular tastes). Some enjoy a basic sauce that's not too distant from a tomato's natural flavor and acidity, and for those folks it's good. I prefer more of a \"cooked down\" sauce with more depth and less acidity, just a preference. 

I also want a 12\" pie to be topped to 11\". Having an inch and a half or more bare crust may look good to some, but I'm a substance guy. And I like a lot of cheese so would order and pay for extra next time.

2nd night's Lasagna was, honestly, just okay.
 It's Lasagna. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rocky's! Their pizza is the best that I've had! I always get a cheese pizza with meatballs and caramelized onions and it's delicious. The meatballs are sliced thin and seem like they're homemade. The garlic knots are also top notch. The owner takes pride in his restaurant and in everything that he makes, and it really shows!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is rated so high. The pizza is not very good and is super expensive. I've order take out twice and both times the food was cold and soggy when I got home (2 miles away). 

I think Harvey's, mama's and prosciuttos offer a much better pizza at a more reasonable price point. 

The man at the counter the first time I went is was not friendly and the second (and last) was downright rude. 

Additionally, I was totally put off when I saw a high school age girl on the absolute coldest day this past winter out front waving a sign."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Pulled pork BBQ and jalape√±os hit the spot! cashier seemed to hate her life working here but the gentlemen spinning the pies seemed to be enjoying himself. Overall okay stop on the road home."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, old world Italian style food..The owner and staff are great!!"}
{"text":"Tried to place first order online. App/website was cumbersome and did not give an order confirmation. Called to confirm and was on hold for 5 minutes before someone came on that could care less that I spent 10 minutes placing the order and another 5 minutes waiting to get handled on the phone. They did not get the order online - so am done. Won't try again. 

This food better be excellent or they will not make it. Service is bad!!!"}
{"text":"I was recently in town for a nice and I grabbed take out from here. The meat pizza was amazing. I got the thick crust and it wasn't overly doughy. It was perfect. The ingredients on the pizza were good quality as well. My bbq wings were crispy as I requested. 

Note: There aren't that many parking spots near the business. But I would definitely return if were in the area."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 2 stars ONLY because the pizza was pretty good compared to other options in the Huntersville area. Lots of problems with this place, however. I called and placed a delivery order over the phone..the employee takes all of my information and proceeds to \"place me on hold\" except she didn't press the mute button!! i hear her asking another employee if they have a delivery driver which is the first red flag. She then tells me it will be about 20-30 minutes until my order arrives. i wait 30, 45, an hour and i can only assume they forgot my order so as soon as i am about to call the delivery driver pulls up. doesn't apologize for the wait and hands me my food.  

The buffalo chicken pizza was luke warm AT BEST which is a shame because the flavor was great. the garlic bread was tasty as well. 

Pizza is way overpriced for the size, you might as well sit down at Brixx and receive waiter service and save a couple of dollars."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!  We have tried most everything and have yet to be disappointed.  The only feedback I have is to work with the girls taking orders and processing pickups.  Every time I call she confuses my order, puts me on hold, or gives someone else our order by mistake.  Other than the small employee training issues this place is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Family friendly atmosphere but have beer and wine for the parents! Wings are great too! Cesar salad is a must!"}
{"text":"Average at best.   Pricing is high but all pizza joints in the lake norman area are overpriced.   Drive a mile for better pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING. Not very many people inside so wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly shocked. They use fresh ingredients and you can really taste it. Cashier suggested the house pizza and it was easily one of the best pizzas we've ever had. Garlic knots were fresh and the perfect blend of garlic and cheese. Already been back twice!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not that good.   My wife and I are from NY and this was not NY pizza, very little flavor.  We ordered ziti for our daughter realized we meant to order the kids portion.   Called back to try and correct the order the girl told us it was already done but we could save the rest for later.   I don't know why we didn't think of that.   The wings were not crispy at all like they should be.  Might have been an off night but probably not going to order again.  Very over priced."}
{"text":"Nice local place, good choice for different pizza joint besides the mainstream.  New york style thin crust pizza.  Specials for different days of the week, kids eat free on tuesday, sunday funday special and a rewards club. Flour hour 4-5  tuesday-thursday $2 slices."}
{"text":"The pizza here is not great. Half of our group thought it was OK, half didn't like it at all. The wings were rather dry. We're from New York, so we requested blue cheese with our wings, but, of course, this being NC, we got ranch served to us, instead. The food was very expensive, as well. Pretty sure that we won't be returning to, nor recommending, Rocky's."}
{"text":"Quiet, family runned, local joint. No long wait times and chain food. Pasta Anitais fantastic. Putannesca on special was also amazing. Will be returning."}
{"text":"It's just ok pizza. Not tons of flavor in the pies. We are spoiled having great pizza from piazanos in Norcross Ga.  Haven't found anything to compare to it in NC so far.  If u are a pizza snob like me you will find Rocky's to be average."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza while in town visiting family. We stayed at the Hampton Inn which is right next to the restaurant. Very convenient! I have to say that the pizza was not very good at all. In fact it was barely more than edible. Pizza is my favorite food so it has to be really, really bad for me too to not want to even eat it. It's really hard to mess up since I love cheese and bread. Unfortunately, this was in fact the worst pizza I have ever had. It was bland, tasteless, and the crust had the texture of cardboard. I added Parmesan cheese for more flavor but it was a lost cause. My boyfriend and I would never return. We have never said that about a pizza place before. I don't believe these favorable reviews on here...they must be paid. Surely they didn't eat the same pizza I had. Terrible pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice. Huge pieces, fresh and hot for a reasonable price!  Very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Rocky' Pizza is the best in Cleveland. True Italian with fresh flavors. Service is always warm and friendly.If you like the local chains with their cardboard tasting crust and flavorless sauce, stop in and see what real pizza taste like."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place, but because of the many reviews claiming they're overpriced, I've been skipping it. Well today I decided I'd try it and I figured how expansive can a personal pizza be? Well if you're the owner of this place somehow you haven't done your homework as to what the surrounding competitors are charging for the very same pie (with unlimited toppings) 

$16.50 for a personal one topping pizza is high! That's the price of a Large, authentic, 3 topping NY City Pie! While I'd admit the pizza was good, it's not good enough to charge that much for a personal pizza! 

The service was ok, the males were a bit obnoxious in an arrogant way. I'm glad I tried it and now I know not to return, not for those prices."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this place! They gave me hope for chicken wings everywhere! Their wings are so good, I, not being a wing eater, was shocked to taste. I had the Teriyaki wings, crispy. Freakin delicious!

The veggie pizza was the bomb as well. The crust was just right! Thin, but not too thin, and crispy.

The fries were like no other I have tasted in Charlotte. Crispy, not your ordinary crispy, on the outside, and a softer texture on the inside. Absolutely LOVED them!

This was our first time going, and we will be going back!

They even have a 25% off deal on here when you check-in!

DON'T MISS OUT! GO TOMORROW!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place for lunch one day so I ended up here. Parking is odd but there's plenty available.  I arrived around 12:15 and they weren't busy at all.  They have a lunch special that says 2 slices and 20 oz drink for 5.99.  Then it's an additional if you want any toppings other than cheese. I feel like you should at least be able to get one topping at the 5.99 price but that's just me.  So my total was 7.70 for two pieces of pizza and a soda. I tried pineapple on one pizza and pepperoni on the other. Once the pizza came out I realized one slice would have been plenty of food.  They are enormous slices. Pizza crust was thin and crispy but overall it was just mediocre pizza.  Clean restaurant, quick service and nice staff but the pizza was nothing special."}
{"text":"Can't give this place anything but 5 stars. I'm a pizza fanatic. I mean hey it has all 4 food groups!  Rocky's pizza was quite frankly some of the best Pizza I've ever had. I grew up in New York so as you can probably imagine I know what good pizza is.  You can tell that this place uses quality ingredients.  It's easy to tell they didn't go cheap on the cheese either. Most pizza shoppes go cheap with the cheese they use.  This place uses high quality which I absolutely love. Unfortunately I was just passing through Charlotte so I won't have the ability to go back again any time soon but if you're in the area this place is a must try.  If you see the owner make sure you tell him the guy with the black Acura CL says hi."}
{"text":"I'll give this place a 3 star rating. Service is good and smells good inside from the yummy baking...or maybe I'm hungry...or hangry. I was told by the Honda service rep up the street that the owner is a jerk. Welp...I don't want to find out nor meet him. His pizza better be good bc so far the handle at the entrance to open the door was nasty--it felt sticky so I immediately washed my hands prior to ordering....I'm a germ-a-phob....major...like the Monk character on USA. 

They didn't have to Tangerine IPA (local brew) I was hoping to try. What I observed after that was not what should have happened which would be a sign on the beer offerings by the cashier to say \"currently out\". I suppose a simple post it note is too much trouble or just taping receipt paper over it with not available. *kanye shrugs* ?

The dining area was very warm considering it was over 90¬∞ outside and there's an open kitchen where you can see your pizza being made. A plus is that they have online ordering but I really think they should take advantage of Yelp order feature. 

The staff as they work together is entertaining--very family oriented....a plus. 

There's an extensive menu of offerings and place is pretty busy with phone in orders and local foot traffic. I'd be leery of delivery since there seems to be some \"hub-bub\" about driving the delivery car...looks to be in good condition, small but fairly new."}
{"text":"Tried Rockys for the first time.  We had the Hawaiian Pizza and Calzone.   Both were cooked well and the ingredients/sauce were tasty.   Been looking for a good pizza place in Huntersville and will return."}
{"text":"My sister just moved to Huntersville so unfortunately Tony's Pizza isn't around the corner from her house anymore.  SIGH.  So while I was babysitting her kiddos last weekend we decided (Yes... me, the 7 years old & the 2 year old decided) that we needed to find the \"new Tony's\" of the neighborhood.  So off I went yelping away to find a good rated pizza place in the neighborhood... and it brought me to Rocky's!

We got delivery and 60 minutes later it arrived.  We did a basic pizza, remember I was with the kiddos, so we didn't get too crazy with the toppings.  1/2 cheese and 1/2 sausage.  It was pleasantly delicious.  It wasn't too greasy, I mean it's pizza, it should probably be a little greasy!  The sausage was cut in shapes like pepperonis, interesting, but delicious and good flavor.  Their garlic knots were as big as dinner rolls and delicious!  The kids could take or leave \"extra bread\", I love my carbs so the knots were ordered and boy was everyone glad I did!  I was fighting the kids to get the last bites of them in!  

They have pizza by the slice at the restaurant and apparently they have a great happy hour... and when I say happy hour I'm referring to the SLICES!  I'm sure they have alcohol specials too, but here I'm concerned with the pizza!

The one thing that was annoying is that if you wanted delivery you had to go to a third-party website/app, like a GrubHub.  (I can't remember exactly what the name was)... but I mean COME ON, what happened to just picking up the old landline and ordering a pizza. Shesh!

Overall, not as good as Tony's, but heck I'll take it as the new Tony's in this neighborhood!  Rocky's we'll be coming back for ya!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to stop by Rocky's located at 10310 Wilmington Street in Huntersville.  We were on our  way back from a nice hot day in Cornelius and had pizza on our minds.  I hadn't heard of this particular pizza joint, but the mood was there so the short detour off the Highway 77 was a no brainer.

When we arrived, Renee immediately greated us and started running through all the great offerings they had.  There was a lot to choose from so we settled on drinking the Hakuna Matata #IPA Craft Brew from the local @D9Brewery and digesting the enormity of their offerings. That hit the spot.

Selecting a good Pizza is bit more challenging here than the chain stores. They have so many varieties that just when you think one sticks out, something else wrestles your taste buds in another direction.  

For us, the big debate was between the Buffalo Chicken pizza with shredded mozzarella, red onions, chicken, and Gorgonzola, and the Bianco which had mozzarella garlic sauce, paremsan, and ricotta. Decisions, decisions ... Renne offered to do a half and half, buy cooler heads prevailed and we went with the Bianco.  Yum.

Pizza wasn't the only item that caught our attention.  Their Chicken & Shrimp Linguini Pasta was a glimpse of heaven and made its way into our To Go order without a second thought:  Best decision ever!

Paul Reitano, the owner came out to visit after he baked our pizza and other items, and gave us some garlic knots to try:  More goodness to go.  

Paul's great-grandfather Rocky, whom this establishment is named after, had immigrated to the States from Italy by way of New York.  He too was a baker and maker of traditional old world pizzas: Reggio Di Calabria style. Paul picked up the baking bug and has spent his life mastering and fine tuning it.  Today he has a variety of traditional items coupled with some of his own creations.  

Paul moved to Charlotte in 2006 and is carrying on Rocky's legacy.  That family tradition is obvious in every bite you take.  The quality, care, and craftsmanship that resonates throughout Rocky's is second to none in Charlotte and beyond. 
Rocky would be proud.

Buon Apeitito!"}
{"text":"Ordered supreme pizza (added banana peppers but wasn't on it) thin crust. It had really great flavor but crust was floppy. I'll probably order again but get the thick crust."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Best pizza I've had  in a long time and FRESH ingredients!! Good for fast and on the go or after football games, etc."}
{"text":"Tried this place the night of my arrival in a place I've never been and Wow! A New York inspired pizza joint with both classic and \"elevated\" topping choices (soppressata and eggplant, yum)! And an owner who LOVES what he does! Have to love the passion of an owner who love comes through in his food!  I got the Stromboli- it's to die for! If anywhere near Lake Norman, NC you HAVE to try and be prepared to LOVE!"}
{"text":"Finally a great thin crust New York style pizza offered in Huntersville.  I love the crispy thin crust and fresh toppings on this pizza.  The calzones, subs, and garlic knots are awesome as well.  This is locally owned and not a chain restaurant.   That shows in a spotless facility staffed with customer friendly people.  This place is a 10!!!!"}
{"text":"Very average restaurant with minimal decor. This restaurant is designed for take out and lacks ambience. The pizza is really greasy and is better when reheated in an oven on day two. The crust was good."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a friend suggestion. I must say as a new person the staff was not helpful in asking questions about the menu...we even said multiple times this is our first time, which was met with blank stares....my Son made his own for the price of the base pie and $1.50 each ingredient, after we paid found out it is basically the same as a specialty for half the price!!! Wish they would have been more helpful other than just staring at us like we bothered then to order. 
On another note the pizza tasted amazing!! 
I will come back again, but more informed as to how to order so I don't get over charged."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fresh ingredients and service was awesome! Clean inside if you want to dine in.  They have some great specials as welll! Will def. makes this one of our go to pizza places!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Chicken Parm and Parm wings were awesome! My wife's Panini was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"WHY IS THIS PIZZA SOOOO GOOD??? AND WHY IS IT NOT IN VA???? :( 

We came across this wonder pizza spot while staying in the hotel next door, and I am sooooooo glad we decided to eat pizza that night! We had the THE BIANCO and it was by far one of the best combinations of flavor on a pizza I ever had! 

It was so good that we order the same thing and a pepperoni pizza the next day around 8:30pm so that we had it in the room when we got home from partying later that night!  While the Pizza is rocking, the owner and staff are equally as amazing. I L O V E  this spot, it is a must have for my trips to the Charlotte NC area!"}
{"text":"Just left and I had the garlic knots, they were huge, and I thought they were small cakes when they came out. DELICIOUS!!!!

I also ordered the 12 wings, I got six Barbolo and six teriayki. I wasn't to fond of the teriayki (I thought it would of have been a sweet tasting), but the overall wings were hugh and cooked to perfection. 

Also I would add the prices are somewhat cheap for what you get, which is a PLUS in anybody's book.

I WILL DEFINITELY BE GOING BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Garlic Knots were great! I had the Bianco pizza and it was one of the best white pizza's I've ever had! My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sub and he said it was super spicy but great! Quick and friendly service, you can watch them make the pizza's which is cool, super casual, only downside no delivery."}
{"text":"I have purchased food from here a total of 4 times now.  One time out of four has been ok.  The food is ok to good. The delivery time is lengthy.  Their website is difficult to maneuver at best.  Today I tried to order with door dash to avoid the aggravation of their website.  The order process was much easier how ever I paid 5 dollars extra for thick crust pizza and they made a thin crust pizza. So at this point I just give up."}
{"text":"Revised Review Below: 

I have eaten at Rocky's before, both in the store and home-delivered. I think they're a bit pricey, but when I want a pizza I am willing to pay a bit more for something good. This past Friday evening I ordered from them to have it delivered. An arrival time of 30 minutes was predicted in my confirmation email. The order was late and cold. 

Disappointed.

Updated and Revised Review

This is the kind of review I much prefer writing. Paul reached out to me and I called his store. He wasn't in, but they forwarded the fact that I'd responded to him and he called me from home. I understand this is his personal business and it was quite clear - he is very passionate about both his product and his relationship with the community. He offered me a free large Rocky's Reitano on my next order, noting from my customer history that that seems to be our favorite. (It is!)  He also pointed out to me that I have savings waiting for me for a free dessert with an order because of my birthday that had just passed, and I still have a half-off reward - a tribute to my recent anniversary.

I'm so glad to see such wonderful customer service and the personal touch that makes Huntersville all that we want it to be. 

Appreciatively,
A grateful patron"}
{"text":"Have been here with the wife a few times and have even order take out.  The food has always been good.  The owner and his staff have always been prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Very good New York style pizza. We got just a basic large pepperoni pizza and finished it off in one sitting. Looks like there's a lot of variety on the menu so next time we can try something different."}
{"text":"Cozy little place less than a mile from home...delicious Italian dishes--had the Italian Wedding soup and linguini in olive oil / chicken.   Good wine list, had an Italian pinot noir.  Bread was delicious. Recommended."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today. Young lady behind the counter was really good at her job. She was super friendly and professional. She tried to upsell me more food which I declined but hey, she's doing her job and management should be proud of that. The restaurant is super clean with a comfortable environment. My slice of pizza was phenomenal and wings were cooked perfectly, and plated nicely. I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken wings and garlic knots from Rocky's. I opted for delivery because it was Super Bowl weekend. I realize it was a super busy time so I had to factor in some patience, quite understandably. The food was good. I was highly disappointed in that all my order did not arrive. The delivery gentleman was not such a gentleman. He shouted at me that he does not work for them... Apparently they contract out their delivery people. I felt very uncomfortable with his response and demeanor. I think that was something notable for the company bc whether or not you're a direct employee, you're a reflection of them. I did call to notify the manager regarding all of the above and to no avail as far as understanding. He said the owner was on the pizza line and pretty much he was going to tell me the same exact thing. Basically, no help! I will definitely be evaluating whether or not to return here again."}
{"text":"I must say Rocky's Pizza hit it right on the nose with their cheesesteak sandwich! I am from New Jersey and since moving to charlotte I have tried several pizza establishments looking for a GOOD CHEESESTEAK! To no avail! Until last night I bravely went out and found Rocky's pizza and the craving was satisfied!
I mean the toasted roll alone was delicious! Many know it's all about the bread first! The steak was tender and the grilled onions,green peppers and the roasted red peppers drizzled through the sandwich was absolutely delightful! I was quite amazed and have finally had a cheesesteak like up North! Talk about HAPPINESS! Will be going back very soon!
All of this and the staff was friendly as well! Met the owner because I had to tell him I much I enjoyed my sandwich! He too was very polite and friendly"}
{"text":"The pizza here is absolutely delicious!  I decided to give this place a try after reading other reviews.  I'm glad that I did.  I purchased a large Carnivaro half Supremo and received 25 percent off my total bill for using the check in offer on Yelp.  I'm a pizza lover and this is definitely some of the best pizza in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner while in town. It was definitely fast, though we were the only ones eating in at the time. Lots of pick up orders while we were there, so that must be their forte. You order at the counter and then take a seat. SO many choices!  We didn't have time to actually read them all (they are written on the wall), so we went with the standard extra cheese and a couple of salads. 

Checking in on Yelp gets you 3 free garlic knots, and that was much appreciated. They are large and more like soft rolls with butter and Parmesan. You really can't taste any garlic. But they were free, so we didn't mind. I wouldn't pay extra for them, though. The Caesar and side salads we got were large and fresh. My blue cheese dressing was just \"meh,\" - no chunks of blue cheese. It tasted like it came out of a jug. 

The pizza was thin crust, but not really \"NY style\" as advertised. It seemed more store bought. The sauce was good - a little on the sweet side (which I like) and the cheese was adequate. 

This place is what it is - good if you are hungry and want something out fast. We'd probably stop in again if we're in the area and need to eat in a hurry. But if you are looking for a true NY Style pizza in a cozy sit down Italian restaurant, you should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"INSANELY DELICIOUS!  Not too often impressed, but this place was exceptional.  Started with garlic knots-hot, fluffy inside, crispy outside, and served with crazy good marinara. The marinara was SO good we asked for an extra side to have with our pizza. Service was friendly and fast. 

We got a 1/2 and 1/2 specialty pizza: pulled pork and bianco. Both were intense with flavor!  Pulled pork had a strong kick and the bianco was my idea of heaven. Perfect with the marinara on the side and looking forward to the leftovers. 

Can't believe we waited so long to go here...We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Huntersville and tried Rocky's for lunch while we were unpacking. The pizza was delivered within 30 minutes and may have been the hottest delivery pizza I've ever gotten! We just did a pepperoni pizza and really enjoyed it. We also got the garlic knots but found them a bit doughy for our liking. We ordered a second time a few days later (to lazy to cook and unpack ) this time got another pepperoni and a supreme. The pepperoni was just as good as the first but the supremes crust had fallen apart at the center of the pizza and did not hold up to the toppings, which were generous. Overall good experience both times I wouldn't order the supreme pizza or garlic knots again but will definitely try other menu items"}
{"text":"I had the lunch special shrimp and chicken Alfredo linguine it was actually pretty good and I had enough to take home the protein is cut into bite size prices but it worked. Simple and easy ceased salad was ok dressing lacked flavor. I will go her again my daughter enjoyed her slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Great Pizza Spot!  The toppings are super fresh.  The marinara sauce is Delish.  It is pretty quick service too.  My fianc√© has not liked any pizza in the Charlotte/Huntersville since we moved here until now (he is all about West Coast Cali Pizza)...and he LOVED this!  We usually get half & half on our pizza, and they were able to accommodate our request."}
{"text":"I'm being insanely generous here, which has everything to do with the friendly staff. I won't be back because I didn't like the pizza at all. Based on the other comments, I'll give Rocky's the benefit of the doubt that they had an off day. I'd recommend Brooklyn South, Mama's, Tony's, or DaVinci's."}
{"text":"We tried Rocky's today for the first time and will definitely be back. I had the garlic parmesan chicken wings, which were excellent... Not greasy like a lot of chicken wings are at other places. The flavor was amazing and they were very moist. My husband had the two pizza slice special. The slices weren't huge! We also shared 3 garlic knots - they were really big, almost like rolls - very good."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that you can envision a little ol' Italian Ma in the back room making fresh sauce. However, it's actually a great guy named Larry that has a true passion for creating gorgeously delicious Italian food. We've stopped in a few times and have gluttonously sampled a lot of the menu, and all of our experiences were hella' stella'. 

Upon entering Rocky's, the aroma of slow-cooked sauce and freshly baked bread taunt your senses. The smells are such a tease, yet the perfect introduction of what is to come. Once you've found your seat in this quaint joint, I highly advise you to put in an order for the homemade breadsticks. They are baked-to-order, and come out of the oven piping hot alongside a bowl of the best marinara I've ever tasted. We tend to pair that baked goodness with a small house salad. All of the salad dressings are made from scratch and are remarkably flavorful. I'm a total ranch queen, and their's is boss! 

For the main coarse, we've dabbled in the pizzas, pastas, and subs. All of them were on point, but I'll be really honest the Uncle Larry's Pizza has stolen a slice of my heart. This pizza is what ALL pizzas should try to be like. Add some of the Old World Pepperoni to it, and it's a total foodgasm. The crunchy crust and savory sauce pair beautifully with the zesty toppings. A better pie has never been made. Did I mention it's smothered in real cheese? Mmmmmmm.

The pasta specials have all been on fleek. This place knows how to serve up some seriously sexy pasta. Whatever the special is, if it lists sausage in it, get it. OMG the sausage at this place is what dreams are made of. I could go on for days, but trust my gut and treat yo'self to some pasta. It's worth the carbs.

Now I should mention that this is a mom and pop shop, so you might end up sneaking your own soda refill, but honestly that is what really makes this place so charming. So far, all of our dining experiences have included Larry or his fabulous wife dropping off little extra nibbles at our table for us (and other patrons) to sample, and each little bite has led us to fantasize about whatever could be coming up next. Rocky's reminds me of eating dinner at a good friend's house. You're basically family here except you wont be asked to help with the dishes. I love this place. 

P.S. Order the Casatta cake. It changed my life (and my thighs) forever, and it was soooo worth it."}
{"text":"Tried rockies looking for a pizza that was great, fresh ingredients and great crust.  This was it.  They have a super fresh salad andthe pizza waseven beyter. We found our new pizza place."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in town. And the garlic knots oh my word they were amazing. Will defiantly be going back there. Got to love NY pizza. Keep up the good work. Fir a new restaurant  you could not ask fir any better. I think they even put older restaurants to sham. Yum yum."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good and the best in the Huntersville area. We order a sausage pizza with green peppers and onions and a veggie pizza.  First time in my family, where both pizzas where gone at one seating by the family."}
{"text":"Searching for a new place to get lunch, I went along with 2 other co-workers in search of a new pizza place. Quick yelp search finds Rocky's, and it's not too far from the office. Score. Parking is a little wonky, but there's a ton of places to park on the street. Since it shares the same building with the Dunkin' Doughnuts that's there, you can take a seat outside, and that's exactly what we did. We decided to split a large Surpemo, and the girl at the counter was nice enough to split the bill for us right there instead of us having to do the whole Venmo thing (always makes things easier!).

The pizza came out fast and hot, and was absolutely delicious. Cripsy bottoms and great quality toppings with not too much grease. For the price, we were all stuffed at lunch, and would absolutely call this a great value. I'm excited to return and try some of their other offerings; Rocky's first impression was a great one!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good. I went there with a coupon but they would not let me use it but other than that it was a good pizza. I enjoyed it very much"}
{"text":"First time eating at Rocky's.  I was able to order the thick large carnivaro pizza with garlic knots.  When i checked in with Yelp, I was able to use a 25% off first order discount!  
The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant has a nice modern decor.  
Pizza was pretty tasty and the garlic knots were good.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I tried Rocky's last night on recommendation from my neighbor. We were standing around the front yard, talking about life, car odors, birds as neighbor John drank a 40. If you ever want to join the conversation, drive down W 10th St on a sunny day and chances are, some of us will be out there doing things like this. I kept getting flustered because a swallow kept swooping down and trying to pick at my skull. My neighbor thought it was the funniest thing ever. Running from this bird combined with partying built up a deep hunger. He advised that I try Rocky's in Parma. I did and once again, my weekend pizza advisor John was right! He is more than a neighbor, he is a father figure. The pizza was thick and filling. They use a decent pizza oven and it develops a nice crispy crust. The sauce, cheese and toppings were all great together. This is one of my new, most exciting discoveries in life."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is tiny and no-frills, but it's very good Italian food.  The pizza is meh but the dinners are great.  Both the ranch and house dressings are great."}
{"text":"The owner is a super cool dude whose extremely passionate about quality, good food! He won't settle for giving his customers nothing but the best.  There is plenty to choose from on the menu.

I love the fresh ingredients! I recently went and tried their calamari, supreme pizza, and garlic knots. I'm not really a fan of the garlic knots because they were a bit too greasy. 

Otherwise, the calamari was delicious with the Parmesan topping. I love supreme pizza so I was impressed! I probably would've wanted it toasted a little more; otherwise, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I rarely give any place 5-stars but Rocky's is so good it deserves it! The atmosphere is authentic Italian and very cozy! The wait staff is nice and the food is delicious. I dined with my niece and we got the Saturday special: an X-Large 2-topping pizza for $11.95. We were surprised when it came out. It was big and had thick crust. The pizza was cheesy and tasted like no other pizza I've ever had! I'd recommend getting meatballs on your pizza - Outstanding! You could taste every ingredient in the pizza! The prices are reasonable. Such a great hole-in-the-wall joint. I would recommend to anyone visiting the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal, Thanks
The Rocky's veg pie and Rocky's salad! All were great.
 Everything was fresh and cooked to order. which means it takes a few minutes. 
It is worth the extra 5 minutes. Real food Real people... Enjoy"}
{"text":"Pasta rustica:sausage peppers and sauce over penne, Italian dressing very good, bread awesome, pizza very good.  Mom and pop shop but food is great, and people who run the place are cool."}
{"text":"My first review was a 4 Star based on a couple slices and included the promise of an update once I ordered a whole pie.  Whole pie ordered, 5 Stars awarded!  We've gotten the same pizza as carryout twice now.  Meatball, pepperoni and onion, cooked well done and both times it was delicious.

I like to heat my slices up in the toaster oven once I get home and that alleviates the issue Ponyboy (Stay Golden Ponyboy) comments on in his 10/1 review.  My wife just gobbled it down straight from the box and she was quite pleased.  

I did experience the soggy crust with one of the slices on my first visit so, that is something they apparently need to work on but, all in all, I'm quite happy with Rocky's.  I just hope the word gets out quickly as it's kind of a weird location connected to a Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins chain and some may not think to give it a chance."}
