{"text":"Don't waste your time eating here. Sashimi was up there with some of the worst I have ever had. There are so many good options on 17th ave which is just a few blocks away for quality Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Best cheap sushi joint in Calgary. Great variety of dishes with quality fish. I've been here numerous times with zero complaints. It's no wonder they've been around for approximately 11 years."}
{"text":"Not bad. Try the curry pork tonkatsu or the sashimi, both were decent. Good portion sizes but nothing spectacular.  The decor is nothing to brag about and wont impress date. However it does make the meal extremely casual and relaxed as you feel like you are eating in someone's home.   The owner/waitress is a nice japanese/korean lady and the kitchen was 1 guy who handled everything.   Overall, a decent mom & pop shop that could use a new coat of paint.  10/30"}
{"text":"Service was quick and to the point Food was excellent Would recommend gyoza and rainbow rolls"}
{"text":"Given the poor reviews, I wasn't expecting much but some noodles would hit the spot and I was on foot and they were close by. I started with a Kirin and assorted Tempura. The shrimp were good but I prefer less batter. Not a big fan of broccoli Tempura but they were properly done in two bite pieces. The zucchini and yam were delicious, perfectly cooked with the right amount of batter. Next was the Spicy Pork Ramen, and it delivered, plenty spicy for me. The amount of meat was sufficient but not what I'd call generous. But still enough I didn't feel cheated. Just a little spendy for a rustic interior. I would come again if in the neighborhood, it's too far to walk to Shikiji."}
{"text":"Traditional Japan right here in Calgary! This is a Ramen review here--I've never tried their sushi yet--but I've tried just about all the hip Ramen places in Calgary, and I've even sampled the ramen from San Francisco Japan Town just to compare. This cozy restaurant \"Japanese Noodle House\" is just plain good, whereas those others were really nothing special despite all the hip young folks that go there. JNH has me coming back again and again, and savouring the subtleties, and welcoming flavours. Makes you feel like home somehow!!   Despite the cozy atmosphere tucked away in the west belt-line area, it's self-evident that this mom and pop duo brought the real goods from the land of the rising sun! And it's the little things that they understand like before serving, the temperature of the broth should be palatable; the meat should be in correct-sized portions (not like the ground beef I was served at another spot).  I've been there half-a-dozen times. I got the spicy pork ramen soy flavour and miso flavour. I preferred the soy. The lady was very nice as well. Some of these other reviewers are saying the same thing as me... that's no coincidence!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi and ramen, Japanese Noodle House is certainly not the pick of the litter. However, I've had occasion to stop and spend some time as this quaint little restaurant several times and have always enjoyed my experience. I read that, because of it's size, it gets quite congested and perhaps slow during the lunch rush. I've never been to Japanese Noodle House during lunch -- only on the occasional evening, but mostly late weekend afternoons -- and have found the atmosphere peaceful and inviting.  The decor, as mentioned, is very \"mom-and-pop\", which has it's own appeal to be sure. It hearkens back to something inside us that longs to sit at grandma's table and just enjoy the ambiance, the simplicity. The staff -- owners? -- are always polite and welcoming, and unlike most restaurants, really leave you to yourself. This might be to their detriment, but every now and then, when you simply want to sip your tea in silence, it's a pleasure not to be constantly pestered as to your level of enjoyment.   The food is tasty and prepared fresh, and while I've had better sushi at a few other places in the city, I've certainly had worse elsewhere as well. The quality of the fish is good, and every now and then the daily special is a true treat. When I was last in, I sampled the East Coast oysters, prepared fresh with a wedge of lemon and a homemade hot sauce - absolutely delicious!  The owners, as mentioned, are very hands off. If you ask for your bill, don't expect it to be delivered to your table. When you're ready, it will be waiting for you at the till. My favorite nail salon is right next door -- Fortune Nails -- and I know that there will be many future occasions when, following a relaxing manicure, I'll find myself drawn to Japanese Noodle House for a pot of tea and some sashimi."}
{"text":"Small and seems little sketchy, but their Spicy pork noodle was so good. Enough spicy, good portion with nicely cooked noodle. Also broth was so good that I drank it all after.   Also it was so cheap. Definitely would go back. And the lady's Korean-English accent was so cute!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for ramen and thought that this would be as good of a place as any to get some. Ramen, for those of you that don't know, is a Japanese noodle soup with a meat broth (usually pork).  I started my order by asking for some genmaicha. This is a standard brown rice tea that is widely available. I was told they didn't have any so I settled on just, \"green\" tea. When the tea arrived at my table I took a sip, BAM! Genmaicha in my cup. They had no idea what I had asked for.  I ordered the spicy pork ramen. I asked about the broth and was told it was miso broth. Miso broth is made from salt, soy and seaweed. See above about the broth.  The meal came, it was spicy and flavorful. There was maybe three small bites of thinly sliced pork. It cost me $10. I felt ripped off.  I might try the sushi here if anyone can tell whether or not it's good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as close to an original small kitchen type restaurant as you will find here in Calgary. Nothing fancy, just authentic decor and great food at a very reasonable price. Having lived in Japan for 9 years walking into this place took me right back there. If you want colourful sushi with fancy names here is not the place. But if your looking for what a true kinda \"hole in the wall\" escape from what you may be used to then I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"On a holiday Monday, we were debating where to go when I remembered it's been awhile since my original visit to Japanese Noodle House.  We dropped by around 2:15pm and were the only people there. Menu still the same but there's always a few specials up on their chalkboard.   - Gyoza ($7.00) - you get 7 pieces. Small but nicely pan fried and hot.  - Ebi suno mono ($5.99) - S thought it was pretty authentic. I'll take her word for it as she's a halfer and speaks fluent Japanese. Shrimps looked really fresh.  - Ramen spicy pork (soya base) ($10.99) - Litaly got the same thing he did last time he was here. Spicy broth and solid noodles.  - Nabeyaki ($17.99) - I decided to try something new and ordered the nobeyaki. Comes in those heavy speciality clay pots (called nabe which the dish is named after).  Dashi broth was light but flavourful. Noodles retained its great, chewy texture. Great portion too.  - Dynamite roll ($5.00) and sake roll ($4.00) - I only tried one sake roll. Decent. The others thought the rolls were pretty average.  Still a solid gem in my books. Stick with the traditional Japanese items on the menu and you'll be in for a treat."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service was mediocre. Their beef tataki is pretty good. Overall not a bad place if you just want udon or simple Japanese food."}
{"text":"Mom and pop hole in the wall but that's not a bad thing. I imagine that if I lived in Japan, this is what ramen would taste like. Get the Spicy Pork noodle, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Super simple and basic inside. Like going to someone's home kitchen. The food is fantastic and all homemade. I even think the sauces are made from scratch to order. The miso soup is my favourite at this place. Not too salty not too watery. Just right."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 purely for the homemade flavourful ramen broth . With all the trendy new ramen joints in this city I set out to discover a quality bowl of ramen in a less then trendy location and found it. It was like eating at a long lost relatives humble abode with ninja ramen making skills. I almost didn't want to share the secret but feel it's a worthy cause!"}
{"text":"Small family owned restaurant that serves homemade-like meals. I've been here a couple of times and have only had their ramen and curry dishes.   The decor and atmosphere is a little outdated, unfortunately, but fits in with their family style theme. The restaurant is also very tiny, which means it can get busy quick, though I've never had to wait, oddly enough.   Service is friendly and quick. Servers are so friendly and very helpful when picking food to try. Food itself has been flavorful and filling, for a decent price. The ramen for example, is only 10$ but is a hearty portion with flavorful broth. They don't offer a lot in their noodles; it's a very simple but flavorful dish. Also, the pork is not the typical char sui other restaurants provide, but thinly sliced \"hot pot\" style pork. Definitely worth the price though!  The curries are also quite tasty. I've had the chicken and pork Katsu, both very crispy, juicy and flavorful. The curry is a little on the mild side, not as spicy (flavorful?) as other Japanese curry dishes I've had, but still yummy. Very filling dishes!   Will be back for the ramen, which is the star of the menu. Unfortunately, have not tried the sushi yet."}
