{"text":"My first few trips to Seven Saints were excellent. The place had just opened. The service was excellent. This would have been a four star review had that not changed. Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.  The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.  Out first few trips, the staff was excellent.  We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy.   On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.  Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff. That said, I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars."}
{"text":"I called in a carry-out order since I need to eat at my desk for lunch.  I have had drinks there before, and had their sweet potato fries for a side.  They were good, so thought I'd give it another try.  I was really disappointed.  I got a BBQ slider and soup for the side.  When I got to work and opened up the container, I felt jipped.  What I had was a slider---yes, a teeny tiny burger.  The soup was in a container not much bigger than one you'd get salad dressing in.    I will say they both tasted good.  Not great.  Not special.  I could have gone to Merryann's and gotten twice as much at half the price.....and they can do greasy burgers, too.  You can also get sweet potato fries lots of places.  I just wasn't impressed.  Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Food was great! Atmosphere, superb! Service by Taylor (041) Fabulous! Travel all the time for work, wish we would come around these parts more often to try all their selections!!"}
{"text":"Went there last Wednesday.  Service was friendly and prompt even though they were very busy. My boyfriend is really into Whiskey and had heard that they had a great selection. According to him they have one of the best Whiskey selection he has ever seen. The staff also seemed to be very informed about the liquor they were serving. I order an assortment of sliders and my BF had the crab cakes and the chicken floutas. All the food was very good but the crab cakes were the star of the evening. Great date night, very reasonably priced, very warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife an I ate there 1-9-12, for lunch. Ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer. For lunch I ordered 2 cheeseburger sliders, my wife had soup and one slider. The food was delicious, the service was great. Food came out fast, but wasn't rushed. Nice decor inside, felt warm and inviting. When we visit our son again at Illinois we will bring him with us."}
{"text":"This is for the rude waitress who didn't take back the cup that had a suspicious hair on it or check on my table. And why is the silverware always dirty here? We would've stayed for more drinks, but she was taking too long to get back to us. Besides that, I love the dark, romantic setting of Seven Saints at night--probably the only reason I keep coming back. I recommend the Black Jack Slider. The others are either really bland or too salty."}
{"text":"This place couldn't be any better!! My boyfriend and I went today for lunch, I got the turkey slider and the Cajun bean and rice soup, while he also got the turkey slider and the 7 saints salad.  We sat outside and it was a gorgeous day, our waitress was really helpful and it was so hard to choose what to order! We both agreed that we could eat here everyday for a month and be happy. His salad was unbelievable- the sesame dressing was mouth watering.  I'm from Chicago just visiting here but I would come back just for the turkey sliders. If you eat you have to go here!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The buffalo sliders are great. The chili is amazing and the salads are fresh. The bar is well stocked and has a trendy feel. This place is not too expensive and a must try if you're in the Champaign area."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful.  Even though the bar is usually packed, the service and the wait staff are always friendly.  Andy, the GM, is always around and making sure everyone is happy and enjoying themselves.  If there ever was a problem, he'd do whatever it takes to make it right.  The food is excellent and the bartenders really know their stuff about drinks and they make wonderful recommendations.  I highly suggest visiting on Wednesday nights for their Whiskey Wednesdays.  I really recommended this bar because of its atmosphere, service, and quality drinks/food."}
{"text":"I really do not like tomatoes in salads but every time I go to seven saints I can't leave without having the BLT salad. It's that good.   This is my go to place to take out of town company. It showcases all of the great things Champaign has to offer without the undergrad chaos.   I only say four stars instead of five because service is at times slow, but the food is always worth it! There's no need to pass it up unless you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"After consultation, the three of us settled on 3.5 stars.  There is a good selection of sliders, and, while the flavors were good, we found the meat rather dry (that included my fried chicken slider). The drinks were solid -- a decent selection of beers on tap and a decent Cosmo. The stand out was the cheese curds, which were perfectly fried and pillowy with a delicious marinara."}
{"text":"We prolly should have come in a lot earlier.  First available table was right by the door.  It was pretty cold the whole time we ate.  Food was great but since it was so busy our wait service wasn't that great. I'd definitely still come here again but this time was so-so."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo. Really cheap and delicious! The salad is large amount!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries stole my heart. I have graduated from college now but I cannot wait to visit Champaign again, my college town, to have these fries again!"}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday evening, 12/10/11 for dinner with my girlfriend.  Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer, my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich.  We both had two drinks with our dinner...  Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good.  Nothing to rave about, but average.  At last, our meal was delivered.  The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast.  As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich, I was in for a huge let down!  This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich.  My biggest complaint, it was paper thin!  PAPER THIN!!!  Literately speaking, my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster.  The price tag on this steak sandwich was $10.  This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches...I don't mind paying upwards of $15 for a steak sandwich, but I expect good quality!   This was such a poor excuse for ribeye, I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off, just to taste the meat.  How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich!  My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review.  Once the check arrived, ($52) we asked to speak with the manager.  We both expressed our concerns with Andy, the manager.  We felt like after spending $50, we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied.  Instead, we were leaving hungry, miserable, and downright insulted!  Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side.  He apologized for the size of the steak, and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience.  REALLY???  We spent over $50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks?  No thanks!  We refused the free drinks, and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good.  I'm not looking for a handout!  I'm not looking for my money back...but the way he handled our situation was horrible!  If a customer spends $50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food, two drinks is not enough to make up for this!  I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance.  Now, I will never be back!  I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake!    Keep your two free drinks!  Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen!  I hope you handle future situations better."}
{"text":"The first few times I went it was great, which was maybe a year ago. Good service, drinks and appetizers. Went again with a group last weekend and was very unimpressed. The food was mediocre at best. I had a shitty ham sandwich that cost more than what it should have and a so-so chunky tomato bisque.   Probably will only go back for drinks without the intention of getting food."}
{"text":"Consistently good drinks and food; can't say I've ever had a bad experience here. Once I got the steak and portabella salad, however, I haven't been able to order anything else on the menu as an entree; it's the best salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this place came on the scene, but I sure would have enjoyed it when I was in college at the U of I.  Many different types of sliders to choose from. Great wait staff.  Stop in after a game. It's a little off the main campus, so you should find a seat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I recently visited Seven Saints in downtown champaign on a Monday. Monday?!?!? Exactly, what I was thinking it's not Tuesday Brewsday or their famous Whiskey Wednesday's but a Monday! I had no idea that they have Ribeye dinners on Mondays and 1/2 Price Wine by the bottle. If you are looking for a dinner cure to your manic Monday I would totally suggest Seven Saints! The steak was cooked a perfect medium per my request and was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think the 1/2 off wine bottle speaks for itself. Iggy was my server for the evening and he gave us the best service even though we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen closed which was 11pm. Thanks Iggy!! Hope you find this review useful!!"}
{"text":"Lack of selection of food and the sliders were small. The goat cheese salad was scrumptious and the tropical slider was tasty with the fresh pineapple on it. Big alcohol selection. The sweet potato fries were decent."}
{"text":"This place is the greatest. Just had my mother's 90th birthday party here.  Above and beyond what we could ask for.  The manager Anne Clark pulled everything together. Server Jenny and bartender Figgy went above and beyond. Love them. Perfect place. Our party ranged from 5 years old to 91 years old and everyone had a great time. Oh. By the way, the food was GREAT. Hot and delicious."}
{"text":"While traveling on business to the area, my boss and I went to Seven Saints on the recommendation of some of the local employees.  It was billed as a good place to get decent food and a good beer.  Being a fan of any and all microbrews I can get my hands on back home on the east coast I was hopeful that they would have at least some local flavor from which I could sample and some food that was palatable after a long day on a plane and in airports.  We got there around 9pm and the place was very quiet (not a bad thing in my mind).  We grabbed a seat at the bar and I was immediately pleased to see Southern Tier on tap.  As a large fan of this line of beer back east but only seeing it in bottle my hope grew.  Along with that some other wonderful names graced the bar taps; Dead guy (again only bottle option for me most times), Fat Tire (a beer that was raved about by my friends after a trip west but I am unable to acquire in my local establishments), and the usual Guiness etc.   Add to my excitement was the very well stocked liquor rail with such rarities as Hanger One Vodka (one of the best flavored vodka line) and Lafroaig 30yr (one of my all time favorite scotch brands).  The bartender was friendly and polite and took our initial beer order.  After scanning the menu i decided on what was recommended to me, the sliders.  Since I could not decide and was famished anyways i ordered 6 of the approximately 12 different varieties they offered.  While waiting for our food I struck up a conversation with our bartender asking for suggestions for good local beers.  He recommended a wonderful beer made by a small time brewery run by two brothers (the name eludes me at this point) and his recommendation was spot on.  By this time our food arrived and i dug into the various sliders.  They were a bit larger then I anticipated but not overly so.  Most came as described  and tasted good. No disappointment on the food front.  After downing my meal and finishing my second beer I asked for one more suggestion.  At this point the GM of the establishment joined us in the discussion over local breweries and suggested we try Foundry.  I choose a bourbon barrel aged brew called Backwoods Bastard.  Alliteration aside it was a wonderful way to end the meal.  We continued to talk and I was very impressed at the effort both the bartender and the GM himself put in for two random customers on a Monday night when they could have very easily just gone about closing up shop and leaving us to our devices.  I have no bad things to say about this place and being a former server/bartender/cook I am not shy about voicing my expectations concerning a locale.  I would definitely recommend to anyone either passing through the area or local to the area to stop by sometime and try for yourself.  If the beer list and quality food is not enough of a draw they do offer specials on liquors and beer knocking the price down significantly for that day.  To fully appreciate this locale I highly recommend going on an off day as I am unsure how a busy saturday night would translate into appreciation for a simple yet enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This is a bar-restaurant with a large beer list and a menu which consists of mostly bar-food items.  Though fried, the cheese curd appetizer was a nice opener.  A variety of sliders were available and, when combined with a shared appetizer and a soup (or salad), presented more than enough food to satisfy us."}
{"text":"As close to a nice night out as you can find in CU.  The food's always been solid, the drinks good and the service ok.  However, it does get VERY noisy during the dinner hour.  While it may not be a true 5 star, for CU it deserves it.  By the way, why does a city with such a strong mixed population have such a terrible restaurant scene??  Will there ever be any NICE restaurants?"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The portions were perfect, you got to try a little of everything without feeling like they need to roll you out when your done. Very good service. Definitely visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Good food with a great environment. Came here for lunch, ordered a sandwich, and left with a satisfied belly. However, the food can be really oily, especially the sandwiches and fries."}
{"text":"Things I like the most: 0. Fish tacos - surprisingly really good 1. Tomato bisque soup 2. Summer salmon salad 3. Onion rings w/ their honey mustard 4. Bratwurst slider  Other beef sliders are not consistent. I had it once and it was super dry, but I am very picky with burgers in general. Salmon slider wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"Decent selection of sliders however their chicken one leaves much to be desired. The beer selection is above average and they have a very large liquor selection. Our waiter was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Their food selection is the main downfall here for me. It's mainly just burgers and some other fried choices. You come here for booze n burgers and not much else."}
{"text":"Had the bratwurst slider with the tastiest waffle fries and spinach bisque. Such a great slider!! They have great combo options. My boyfriend had the Black Jack slider which was oh so tasty!! Best sweet potato fries that I have EVER had. Perfect balance of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. No complaints here!! Wait staff was very nice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in C-U. The staff has always been great, the drinks are always good (check out their nightly specials like Whiskey Wednesdays), and the atmosphere is great. I did once order a drink that I did not like at all at no fault of the bartender since he made it correctly, but he could tell I did not like it, admitted it was his least favorite drink on the menu, made me a new drink and took it off of my bill. No complaints there!. I will say that not all of their food is a home run, but it is good enough that we take people here often. You just have to know what to get. I recommend the fried cheese curds (amazing) and the fish tacos with avocado. I have friends who like their salads and sliders, and my kids like their chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Love this place! A great casual restaurant with truly good food. A lot of options and different combinations that can be done and that just makes the menu even better. The atmosphere is casual but still feels upscale. Would definitely recommend for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato fries. The sliders are really fun. I heard the whisky selection is great."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was amazing and the liquor selection was very impressive. Very friendly staff. Highly recommend this bar if in the champagne area. The menu had a ton of options wish I was in town longer so I could try more things."}
{"text":"even with me being extremely picky about my meat, my boy and i come back to this place time and time again, and it is the go-to place to take anyone from out of town.  i love the atmosphere of this place. i've gone on all nights of the week, and i have never been there when it was too crowded or too loud. the service has always been good, especially when you sit at the bar. i've always had great recommendations from the servers for both beer and food (their beer list is great...tons of options).  on to the food...i typically get the triple s deal (you choose from salad, soup, slider, and side) and i get: a salad (i like the aisan salad and the blt salad sans bacon), their waffle fries or sweet potato fries, and then i substitute in a boca burger for one of their sliders. the different sliders i've tried have been good, and the only complaint my boy had was with the brat slider (said it just didn't feel right having a brat patty). the flavors are always good, and the portions are perfect. the only thing i've tried that i haven't liked are the cheese curds. living in wisco for 4 years, i have had my fair share of cheese curds and these just don't do it for me. but, some of my out-of-towners have said they don't mind them. another perk is the prices. without alcohol, our bill was about $20 for 2 people with tax. with alcohol, for 2, our bill is between $30-$50 (depending on if we're having beer or hard alcohol). so, test it out and see what ya think, but i'm thinking you're gonna like it."}
{"text":"I think that Seven Saints is wonderful!  I have been there now a few times and everything is delicious.  I also find it to be reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I came to Seven Saints on a Wednesday night, having learned they would be offering scotch at half price. As I've always wanted to get into scotch, and thought I'd give it a try.  When I grabbed a seat at the bar, one of the bartenders cheerfully greeted me, went through the specials, and gave me some menus. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that half price offer wasn't limited to a few selections, but rather ALL scotch.   Food: While the food selections were nothing innovative within sandwiches, salads, soups, and gourmet sliders, but they offer a pretty wide variety of each. It seemed like the price of a meal ran from about $7.50-$10, which is a pretty fair price. I ordered a BBQ and Asian sliders with some sweet potato fries, and was also pleasantly surprised this was not your typical White Castle sliders. My meal arrived in good time, and was quite yummy and filling.   Drink: Not really knowing what to order, I took the suggestion of their featured scotch, being a Finalta Glenmorangie. It was pretty tasty, and for half price at $6, you can't go wrong. Per additional suggestion, I also tried a Springbank, a French Oaked scotch, and a Lagavulin, which I was told represented the different regions and styles of scotch. I was happy with the size of each pour, and the bar was generally pretty quick to refill my water.   Service: Although it seemed to be a busy, each of my bartenders Zack and Rick approached me as often as they could, kept my drinks filled, and happily took time to answer my questions about scotch. They were very informative, charismatic, and hilarious.   Ambiance: The place has a sort of an old gothic feel to it, which I found neat. Everyone seemed to be dressed in casual to business casual, and the entire atmosphere was pretty laid back with great music selection. The staff was friendly, everyone else sitting at the bar seemed nice and were happy to shoot some brief conversation.   Overall: I really enjoyed myself at Seven Saints. Flawless on my first try with drinks, food, and service, I'll definitely come back for another night of whiskey!"}
{"text":"WHAT A GREAT FIND.   The food at Seven Saints was really good and price point was very reasonable.   They had a unique selection of sliders - we tried the Asian, Tropical, Bbq, Blackjack, and bacon. Every one was delicious.   Because the restaurant was busy we ate at the bar. We received great service. Despite the crowd, food arrived quickly and the bartender was very attentive.   Our bill without tip was 49.00. We had 6 sliders, sweet potato fries, waffle fries, an appetizer platter and two beers. I will note: everything here is al a carte.   Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love Seven Saints. Easily my favorite bar in Champaign, and the food's pretty good too.  Let's start with the food. The sliders are fantastic. I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).  As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic).   My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab dinner and drinks with friends, but only when I have a lot of time on my hands.  The food is good and the prices are on the high side of fair.  The problem is the service.  Really slow and with an attitude, no matter when you go or who your server/bartender is.  They seem unable to handle a crowd of more than about 3 tables without the staff having a melt down.  I go because I like the food, they have a good beer list, and the place is quiet enough that you can actually talk to the people you're with.  It's a really nice place to kill a few hours and catch up with old friends."}
{"text":"Worth eating here but not exceptional. I am a poor person so restaurants that are *slightly* more expensive have to be worth the extra cash for the marginal improvement of food quality. I can't say spending more money was worth it to me. Ok bar to drink at."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing. Broccoli salad was awesome. Also had bratwurst slider and bbq slider. A lot of beers to choose from too!"}
{"text":"First off, the hummus is amazing! You can tell they make it themselves. The warm pita bread that comes with it left this appetizer a real treat. We've been twice and ordered different sliders every time, and everything has been delicious. It's great to be able to try several different things in one meal, and the prices are spot on too. The house cocktails are awesome, as well!   My boyfriend wasn't thrilled about the portion of dessert we received in proportion to the price, but one bite of the oatmeal cake and I was in absolute heaven.   We will definitely be back. A great spot for a drink, a group outing or a casual date!"}
{"text":"This bar is a specialized whisky joint. I don't drink whisky but their selection for cheap to high end whisky is substantial. I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there."}
{"text":"Thought it was a little pricey for average pub grub.  Not terrible, but not that great.  The deserts were good, but the sliders were unremarkable.  I wouldn't chase you away from the door, but not really a \"good\" restaraunt.  If you're gonna drop a C note for 4, you could do better."}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad at Seven Saints. Their sliders are a favorite, and their drink menu is extensive. Restaurant is always full and the ambiance is great. I love the curtain at the front door. Eating outside in the warm weather is nice too except for downwind cigarette smoke, ugh. The only bad thing I'd say is that the waitresses and waiters are never all that friendly."}
{"text":"Several of my colleagues and I love whiskey and bourbon.  One of our favorite things to do together outside of work is drive over to Seven Saints for Whiskey Wednesday and just start buying each other rounds of amazing, 1/2-off whiskey.    1/2-off whiskey alone is worth 5 stars to me, but what really puts Seven Saints over the top are their amazing sliders.  They have about 8 or so different kinds and since they're relatively small you can comfortably have 2-3 of them in one meal.  Top that off with some waffle fries and ranch dressing and I'm the happiest camper."}
{"text":"Seven Saints is one of those restaurants you desperately want to be good.  And I suspect it will be eventually.  It's high on concept and decor, but sort of mediocre when it comes to delivering the goods.  The menu is focused on their \"slider\" burgers-- about 10 different varieties-- that can be ordered individually, or with salads or soups or sides in multiple configurations.  They also feature a large range of salads that can be sampled in the \"Triple S\" combo.  Choose any three of half a salad, a slider, a side or a soup for $9.  Seemed a great way to sample the menu... and pretty affordable for the amount of food offered.  On this visit I had the Hawaiian slider with grilled pineapple and peanut sauce that Melissa mentioned in her review.  Mine was pretty awful, I must admit.  The meat was dry and terribly over-seasoned.  I'm not sure if this was an anomaly; the salad-- the Country Fried Chicken Salad-- was delicious, as were the fries-- waffle and sweet potato.    The service was on the amateurish side.  We were annoyed by our waitress repeatedly trying to get us to reorder an appetizer that we cancelled because they were out of the sauce... and then had made more.  But by the time our third refusal was issued, our food came, thereby proving our point about getting appetizers after entrees.  I know.  It was as confusing as it sounds.  Final complaint: fountain iced tea.  I can't abide by it.  Since Seven Saints is trying to go all high-concept with their food, I find it abhorrent that they can't go the distance and brew their tea.  It's the summer!  No one likes tea from concentrate... especially not people who will pay $3 for a teeny-tiny burger.    We definitely want to try this place again and hope it's a bit better next time.  It has a lot of promise.  For lunch including two drinks and two meals, tax and tip, about $25-30.  Very reasonably priced, I'd say."}
{"text":"Ugh, don't go here. The place looked nice, but the food was awful. Fatty gristle in one of my sliders, an overcooked, dried-out turkey burger in my other, and freezer-burned, tasteless sweet potato fries. All preceded by super fishy-tasting crab appetizers, served with the palest, most tasteless tomatoes ever.  Then there was the poor customer service. I had to ask to see a manager when none of the waitresses cared that my food was crappy. He asked if he could do anything for us, but we're from out of town, so not really. Could have given us the dinner for free, but he didn't. He explained that, yes, the fries were frozen, and that he instructs the kitchen to cook the turkey burgers really, really well. I get not wanting to make people sick, but if you can't cook something correctly, shouldn't you take it off the menu? I recommend people stay away from this place. I would have been a thousand times happier if I had gone next door to the Esquire and gotten a regular-tasting burger and hot fries. Seven Saints uses poor-quality ingredients and has a ways to go in training their staff."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends on a friday evening. The atmosphere was pretty casual; it had a pretty urban feel in the downtown Champaign area. As a college student, it was nice because it is also right off the bus station stop.   Their specialty is supposedly their 'sliders' and we all got the \"Triple S combo platter.\"  All in all, the sliders were pretty good with a pretty good price range. By the second slider though (I got the Smokey BBQ Slider and California Turkey Slider), my taste buds got pretty bored. Even though the sliders have different 'flavors,' the meat and bacon were pretty uniformly made (they did not ask us how we would like our meat cooked).   However, my friend strongly recommended the tomato bisque. I also like the medium cut sweet potato fries (if you're into that)!"}
{"text":"Well, second chance here.   I'll up it one star because they have upped the dress code, which is great!   However: this place it a sandwich shop dressed as a dinner place. I truly believe they need to decided which one they are. The menu is confusing and to extensive. They have a lot of options and the combinations are limiting.   I got a Black and Blue Salad and my husband tried the bratwurst slider and the fried chicken slider.   The fried chicken slider tastes exactly like a McChicken!!! Truly amazing.... Only the real thing is bigger. The bratwurst slider was ok. The meat was good, the bread was soggy and the sauerkraut was lacking in crunch.   My salad was ok in flavor. The meat was microwaved and had no crispy ends... Clearly reheated. The mushrooms were soggy and had the same look as large slugs.   The soup tasted great!!!! But after asking if it was homemade, our server said it was bagged.   We were offered the shrimp tacos, but the shrimp is previously frozen too.   I'm still disappointed in Seven Saints. They need to decide what they are. A fancy bar or an American lunch spot, they can't be both. It's not working.    I would love to see the mood lightened and the have a fantastic sandwich shop instead!! Or, simplify the menu, make it classy and keep the dark dinner atmosphere.   Sorry I can't do better, but I don't lie in my reviews."}
{"text":"Seven saints has a good atmosphere and decent food. Always order the cheese curds.  Their sliders are good, but maybe a tad pricey. I used to be a fan of the black and blue salad, but its been steadily getting worse over time.  They have a good selection of beer.  Anyway, it beats out all the campus town bars, but for down town champaign its ok. I come here for burgers and beer.  When I just want good beer, i go down the street."}
{"text":"Always enjoy an evening here. The \"Triple S\" combos are the crowd favorites. Mix and match to find your perfect combo."}
{"text":"Everything here is good and everyone I know agrees. Will eat here as long as I live here and they don't mess up."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I had the slider, soup, and side combo.  BBQ slider was great, very flavorful with very little spiciness, just how it should be.  The salad was good (fried chicken salad), all of the components were better than I expected (though I had high expectations).  The waffle fries were very crispy.  Not how I like them, but still good.  The noise level wasn't too bad for a busy lunch crowd.  It was loud enough to be noticeable, but not enough to interfere with our conversation, so it was bearable.  The prices are great.  For under $10, I had a large meal with great flavors.  I marked no on Good for Kids, because there is no kids menu.  But we are considering bringing our kids here sometime in the future."}
{"text":"My teammates and I tried doing as many different places for lunch while on assignment in town, and of all the places we did, we found ourselves here the most.   I can honestly say that we did not have a single bad meal here. The tomato pesto grilled cheese is amazing. Their lunch combos are just the perfect amount of food. All of the soups were tasty - my favorite was probably the Italian Wedding.   Nice atmosphere and consistently good service; would return if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I took the Amtrak down to U of I for a football game this past weekend vs. Michigan (Illinois won - SWEET). The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"  Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and  not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.  The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.  When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything. But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment."}
{"text":"Great range of sliders, amazing beer and liquor selection. Awesome pecan pie! Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me, and I enjoyed myself.  When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if I was underdressed, was it a dinner only place, the dark lighting, the fancy decorations, I couldn't tell.  But the maitre d' was totally welcoming, and when I asked \"Are you food only or can we get drinks?\" he laughed and said it was no problem, and asked where we wanted to sit.   We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast.  After we sat down, we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather, but didn't feel like moving.  I didn't look at the food menu, but a few people I was with ordered food.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 orders were wrong.  One friend doesn't red meat, and ordered chicken in her salad, only to bite into a piece of steak.  Another friend said her food was just okay.  They had some nice beer choices, and after several years in CA, the prices seemed reasonable.  And actually, I ordered a beer on tap that I didn't end up liking.  The bartender saw that I wasn't drinking it, and asked if I wanted something else.  No problems, no extra charges- it was very considerate.  Granted, I should have asked for a taste before I bought it, but I would have eventually drank it.  It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed.  Overall, a pleasant experience, and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my husband. We love the craft beer offerings pair with the different slider combo options.  I ordered a 1/2 salad and one slider ($7.99 is a great value for what you get!). So many options to choose from but I opted for the Country Fried Chicken Salad (with no egg) and the Bacon and Cheese slider.  I love the freshness of all of the salads I've had at Seven Saints. It's nice to eat fresh spring greens and veggies rather than the typical iceberg/romaine mix you see often. The cucumbers, tomatoes, and mushrooms were quite tasty!  The slider was fabulous. Juicy and served with thick-cut bacon.  Seven Saints always has a few Triptych beers on draft along with offerings from breweries such as Bell's and Great Lakes. I enjoyed a Chillwave IPA form Great Lakes this time."}
{"text":"The sliders here are great!  I've tried the hawaiian, the tuna, the bbq, black & blue, and I've really enjoyed all of them.  I usually order a slider with a small salad, and their salads are really filling.  Ordering a few different sliders is a great way to try different flavors in one sitting, you don't have to commit to one giant burger.  They have great service and good beer here to.  Great place to start a night at!"}
{"text":"If you're too lazy to read my novel (no judgment) here is a summary: Seven Saints = awesome.  I'm sure you've seen a lot of 5 star reviews on Yelp! and thought to yourself, \"this person's 5 star is probably a 3 in my book\" so I think you need a little back-story to understand just how hard it is to score the coveted 5 red stars in my book.  I'm high maintenance.   I'm also spoiled. I'm from California where there are actually more than six places to choose from for cocktails and late-night dining. It's not that I don't love quaint little Champaign-Urbana, but if a place doesn't  live up to your expectations, there are not many other options to choose from.  Ask any of my friends: they heard me complain about this for months when I first moved here over three years ago....   Then I found Seven Saints.   This place excels in everything I look for: customer service, quality product, and environment. As you can see from the pictures, the ambiance is warm, intimate and inviting. The seating and decor create an environment that is perfect for enjoying time with a date, group of friends, coworkers, and even people you don't really like but are forced to hang out with once in a while.   Their menu has what I like to think of as fancy versions of classic Midwestern treats. They are famous for their sliders--try the Black Jack Slider, come back here, and thank me. Or go for the hat trick and add on the Salmon Slider and California Turkey Slider and thank me three times. The lovely waitresses & waiters are always friendly and attentive. It's amazing how they stay on top of tables & orders when it gets busy. As for drinks, I'm just starting to learn about beer and they have a wide selection to choose from. Tuesdays they have beer specials, which is a great time to sample things I wouldn't normally order.   And now for my favorite part: Whiskey Wednesday. I've waited over two years to write this review because I treated Whiskey Wednesday like Fight Club... it's so awesome, you aren't supposed to talk about it. The guilt has pushed me and I feel it is now time to let those of you who don't know in on this marvelous secret: every Wednesday they feature 50% off their whiskey menu. That's right. This isn't a fake-out Miko's 50% off either. This is an unbelievable selection of quality whiskeys from around the world... for half the price. They rotate weeks from North American, Irish, Bourbon and Scotch in addition to weekly featured bottles.   I'm not cool enough to call myself a whiskey connoisseur, but I am very stuck up about my whiskey. The two Whiskey Wednesday bartenders are amazing and are always able to find new and exciting things for me behind the bar. They REALLY know their stuff. Try it. Go in and pick any whiskey off the menu. They can tell you about the grain, barrels, aging process, blend--everything. I can't even remember what I had for lunch yesterday. They are extremely helpful and know the full range of whiskey flavors. I've been in many times with friends who don't drink whiskey often, or are just starting out and want to go easy. It doesn't matter how experienced you are, the Whiskey Wednesday boys will take care of you.   Andy is the general manager and I can never say too many good things about him. At most other restaurants, you'll see the manager walking around to check things out, but that's about it. Andy introduces himself and actually talks to the customers. He is always around to make sure people have a good experience. It's a pleasure to listen to him tell you about the history behind a specific bottle or cocktail. If you've seen him on the CBS morning show, you can tell how passionate he is about what he does.   So yes, I just gushed about Seven Saints--but I mean every word of it. The quality products & excellent customer service are enough to satisfy this high-maintenance Californian. I'm also narcissistic enough to believe you'll actually come back on here to thank me. Seriously. Go check them out. I'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"the service has always been good when i've been there.  i even once walked there with my husband and our young son in a stroller.  they were awesome enough to accommodate our larger than life stroller in another room while we dined with our progeny.  no dirty looks about the baby stroller.  just awesomeness as they stowed it away in another room.  that gets a star all by itself.  the beer selection is top notch, so if you're into that.... you're covered.  if you like cheese products deep fried and dipped in crazy fattening ranch dressing... you're also in luck.  apparently it's great.  i've never eaten it, but i've heard tell.    the sliders are okay.  not great.  not bad.  just okay.  i get the vegetarian burger.  it's... meh.  i can heat up a griller patty in the microwave at home and put it on a tiny bun for all of about $1.25.  i understand that businesses have to make money, but at least make me feel like i'm getting something new and exciting for the price.  this place would get a solid two stars from me if not for the amazing.... decadent... brown sugar oatmeal cake.  i don't eat sugar often... but when i do... it's this place for THAT cake.  holy hell.  it's terrible for you, and it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Sorry, the cheese curds didn't do it for me. They had a thick, chewy breading and were over cooked. Fried curds should have a thin, crispy breading. Now the sliders were wonderful, especially the brat slider. And I had a can of the best cider I ever tasted... I think it was Vander Mill Totally Roasted. It's brewed with candied pecans, but it's very dry and the pecans add a delicious nutty edge. The service and atmosphere were terrific!"}
{"text":"The two things I love most about this pub are the sliders and the massive selection of alcohol. I love how you can substitute all the meat patties on their sliders with a boca patty and the quality is always excellent. If I'm ever fiending for sliders and beer, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Whiskey Wednesday is the best night for me, as the whiskeys are 1/2 off. Categories of whiskeys change over each week, so if you love bourbon... it's once every 4 weeks. Go to app is the cheese curds. Sometimes I fail in sharing them. There are some pretty cool off menu items, but if you're staying traditional, I go for a slider combo. Ultimately, there is nothing bad on the menu... so have at it."}
{"text":"The food here was ok.  The cheese curds were awesome.  The batter on them are light and the cheese itself is a big hunk.  I ordered the black and blue salad which was ok.  I was expecting a variety of greens but it was just lettuce.  The sweet potato fries were excellent.   Service was good, fast and friendly.  I'd go back for the fries and cheese curds."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and all the earlier ones were pretty good, but this last time was just horrible. I went here on a Saturday with a group of 12. We got there around 8pm. I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes.   The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it.   After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.  Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked."}
{"text":"First off.... they have a real deal drink selection. The beers are just like all the other taps around, (good quality independent brews) I have had a \"steak salad\" ( I forgot the official name of it) and the meat was a bit tough for me, I politely stacked it into a napkin and at the greens. I have rocked some sliders.. those are pretty great. There was a time when I was so very much in the mood for a Tuna Melt. I mean... a good tuna melt is so damn good. I got a tuna salad sandwich with cheese melted onto one of the pieces of bread. Not much tuna melt action. Eye of the beholder though, I get that. I appreciate that they are downtown, and quite busy often. That's good energy, not a bunch of drunko ass frats being all loud and pukey. The staff is absolutely awesome. bar, servers, everyone. My lack of a couple stars is due to the couple of times I didn't really dig the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Seven Saints a couple times and thought I'd go for my birthday on a Friday night on unofficial weekend. Out waitress was patient and recommend us a few drinks to start. We ordered the 7 Sinners Platter as an appetizer to share. I got a California turkey slider and half of the summer salmon salad. The half salad was larger than I expected and has a decent amount of salmon and avocado. The food and drinks were delicious and filling. I highly recommend the summer salmon salad along with any of the combos. We couldn't leave without dessert, so in the end we ordered the special creme brulee cheesecake (!!) and pecan pie. Everything was great! No complaints and I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my sister's birthday dinner and absolutely loved it! We actually weren't hungry at all coming in as we had just finished going through a food tasting with my wedding venue. But we drove two hours to take her to dinner so we weren't leaving without eating together lol BUT, I only shared that because normally, food tastes SO good when you're starving and not so good when you're full. But even on a full stomach, we all thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered.  The blackjack slider - loved it! So flavorful! It came with pepperjack cheese, grilled onions, and ancho-ailoli topped with fried jalapenos. YUM!  The Tomato and Pesto Gourmet Grilled Cheese w/ Tomato Soup - hands down the BEST grilled cheese and tomato soup I've ever had. I normally don't like to order things at a restaurant if it sounds like I can make it at home, but this i could never make at home. It was SO good. My sister also generally hates tomato soup but really liked this one - Highly recommended.  The Club Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries - I actually didn't love the sandwich and thought the bread was a little dry, but the fries were delicious!! I couldn't stop eating them.  For dessert we got the brown sugar oatmeal cake and drunken pecan pie with chocolate - both were delicious!"}
{"text":"After dropping our son off at U of I for the new school year, my husband and I needed lunch.  Most of downtown Urbana was packed with students, and had blocked off a ton of streets for their back-to-school celebrations.  This meant we couldn't go to any of the eateries we wanted to try.  This ended up being a plus because we found Seven Saints in Champaign instead!  Seven Saints in a nutshell:  Snazzy decorations, cozy, great service and good food.  APPETIZER:  I HIGHLY recommend the chicken flautas.  They're similar but a little different than your typical southwest eggroll.  It comes with a mango salsa on top, with 2 dipping sauces.  We got a sweet one and a chipotle ranch dressing.  Both super good.  The chicken was very fresh - not the rubbery stuff I've had at other restaurants.  SLIDERS:  They have a whole menu page dedicated just to sliders options.  Cool idea!  They have everything from salmon sliders to pork sliders, but I opted for a Chicago hot dog slider, and a BBQ bacon cheeseburger slider.  I liked the hot dog better.  The bacon on the other one was a little too chewy for my taste.  My husband got a buffalo chicken slider and a bacon cheeseburger slider and he loved them both.    Our waitress was laid back and friendly.  The place was pretty full, and I could see it being a college (and older) bar scene in the evening.    DESSERT:  They had a few great choices, blueberry cheesecake, a ding dong-type of chocolate cake, an oatmeal cake that sounded good (but my husband doesn't like oatmeal...)  and maybe one or two others.  We split the bourbon chocolate pecan pie (that's probably not the exact name, but it was a pecan pie with chocolate in it, so...  It was beautiful, warm and gooey (check out the pictures!).  The crust was buttery and delicious.  Next time we visit our son during the school year, we'll for sure stop in for a meal.  There's a pesto and tomato grilled cheese I must try!  P.S. Down the street there is a cute little bakery called Cream & Flutter.  Check it out too!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner upon recommendation from a friend. I agree with a previous reviewer, the ambiance of this place has a restaurant chain feel. The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.  Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds  for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S   There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.  I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).  All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the appitisers are excellent. But make sure you don't come too hungry.  Great things : 1) cheese curds 2) sweet chips 3) the look of the place   Not so great things : 1) drink menu is not intuitive  2) be prepared to wait a long time (30 min wait, 2.5hrs meal time for a large group)  Appropriate place to come with friends for a casual celebration, but grab a snack before you head out."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was just so-so.  I ordered half portobella mushroom sandwich and half black and blue salad.  I love salads but this one just wasn't right.  The steak in it was so chewy.  I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm.  It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd.  I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad.  Maybe it's me but it's just not right.  The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good.  Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me.  They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.  The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that.  I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat.  Some people love it and some people don't."}
{"text":"came here with 2 other friends and we were all super impressed by how decorated and expensive the interior looked! They have lots of space for seating so we were seated and served very quickly. The waiter was super nice to us since we all took quite a long time with their burger menu. They have a special where you're able to get a burger and salad and fries but under $10, which is great especially for us college students. I was impressed by their burger but I did think their salad could've used some more work, but overall I was impressed and would come again!"}
{"text":"Love it. The food is good, the service is GREAT. I just love this place!!!! SLIDERS ALL THE WAY!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service is usually very attentive and nice. Reasonable price and above par quality. Excellent sliders."}
{"text":"The cheese curds and plate is to die for! This is a really fun restaurant for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Some unique items on the menu.  Good service and the quality I would expect in a bigger city - with small town prices."}
{"text":"I honestly got all my friends to go here. I went here for a friends birthday and FELL IN LOVE with their food. I ALWAYS get the grilled chicken slider with their honey mustard for dipping and their asian salad, it is seriously to die for yummy!  We always get a plate of cheese curds for the table since we can't resist.  For the many times I've made a decision to go back to Champaign for a visit, I'll admit, dining at Seven Saints has always heavily swayed my decision towards making the trip!"}
{"text":"This place is way overrated and overpriced. The service sucked and food was subpar at best. I only gave it three stars because the drinks were decent although the bartender must have been a shut in."}
{"text":"Arguably one of my favorite bars near campus. What a beautiful bar, complete with bartenders who know their whiskey. Go on Whiskey Wednesday for half off all bourbon and whiskey. Their fried cheese curds are also surprisingly delicious. I can't wait to create some more memories in this friendly, inviting bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Try everything! The prices are right so you are able to try everything and then the wonderful unique desserts. Short and sweet. I mean that literally. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was good, but it didn't quite live up to expectations. The service took forever. From the time we sat down it took 20 minutes to get our order taken. The cheese curds were good but again, not amazing like I was expecting. I had the bbq slider which was great, and the sweet potato fries were awesome. Didn't care for the goat cheese salad but that's just my personal taste. I liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sliders are what this place is all about. Each one is between 3 to 4 dollars and tastes great for the price. It takes only about 3 to 4 sliders to fill you up, meaning this place has got some bang for its buck. The atmosphere here is great but the place is very noisy on a busy day. It's a place worth giving a shot, and even if you don't find yourself to be a fan at least it wouldn't be an expensive lesson."}
{"text":"Love the sliders 7 saints salad is to die for. Nice atmosphere and outside sidewalk seating when weather is warmer. Best food in a bar in town."}
{"text":"Always great, fresh food. Quick service.   This is my go to place when I'm in town. Been here a dozen times and always have had a great meal.   If you're drinking, they have a huge liquor selection and also a decent beer selection.   There's metered parking outside on the street."}
{"text":"Summer in Champaign is ALL about outdoor seating. This great new restaurant has got it right. With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare. However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond). In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west. All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall! Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people."}
{"text":"It was a very nice experience. The atmosphere and the music were pleasant.  The salmon slider was delicious, I ordered it with Asian salad and the waffles fries and it was so yummy, I recommend it. There is a variety in the menu and I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Very good food, sliders are a lot bigger than a person would think. The slider combo is a good pick. Staff was great polite and fast. We got cheese curds a couple sliders and there chili. All was really good for a decent price. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Pretzels were ok. Tomato bisque soup was delicious. Server was nice. Kept our sodas filled. Nice environment."}
{"text":"Great place in downtown Champaign. Food and service are great. Be sure to stop in on Tuesday's if you like draft beer, it's brews day and they are half price!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST cheese curds in champaign!! I love this place for the atmosphere and the food is amazing! Wish there was more seating available!"}
{"text":"Always had good food and service here. They have a wide variety of food choices and it's good quality food. The atmosphere is busy but it's nice."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've never had a bad meal or drink here. Employees are friendly, atmosphere is great, and all in all one of my favorite places to go downtown.   The California slider & buffalo chicken are two of my favorite sliders. The bruschetta is money....so are the salads. Honestly anything you get is going to be great."}
{"text":"Seven Saints has plenty of options of all kinds if you're looking for a place to get a drink, but you prefer something outside the normal bar fare. I also had the 7 Sinners apperizer plate, which contained fried mushroom, onion rings, and cheese curds. All of it was very good and fairly priced. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have had drinks and food here twice.  I was pleased both times, even if their prices make ordering food an occasional thing rather than a regular one.  The staff were friendly and knowledgeable both times, and they were eager to help suggest drinks to try.  The cocktails were tasty, although a little on the strong side for my tastes.  When we had a party too large for the tables in front, they gladly opened the back room for us to all sit at the same table. The sliders were good, the soup was hot and tasty, and I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the place.  I'm glad I'll be going back for my bf's after work outings."}
{"text":"The place is neat and the waitress was awesome. Came here for lunch and The food was delicious and for the price and the amount of food received was more than enough! I ordered the pick 3 and wow, the slider was good, the sweet potato fries and salad was great!  I will be coming back and highly recommend trying this place!   Also orders a alcohol drink and they are not selfish with their alcohol! Very strong!"}
{"text":"I really like coming to Seven Saints for the food. I also enjoy a beer or cocktail on occasion.   I love the cheese curds. The tomato bisque is my favorite soup of theirs and every now and then I'll have different sliders with my soup. I've also had some of the regular sized sandwiches and those were all good as well.   They have an extensive libations menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice and the food is awesome there. My friend and I order combos that fed us well but were low in price! I would highly recommend summer salmon salad!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch a couple weeks ago and the food was eh.   The decor is cool and the service is friendly, so I would recommend going here to drink and not necessarily to eat.  For my appetizer I ordered the pretzels.  The cheese dip they come with was a hit and the pretzels were good.  For my meal, I ordered the chicken tenders.  These were pretty disappointing.  Chicken tenders are normally a safe bet anywhere, but these were over cooked, tough and dry.  I would not recommend them at all.  Good thing I filled up on pretzels!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, it's on a whim and it becomes some accidental hetero man-date with my friend Nathan.  That said, the sliders are pretty good, the appetizers are good, but avoid the whole fried food platter.  You'll pray that your greasy oily body explode after a few too many fried cheese curds or mushrooms.  Damn.  Beer selection is pretty large, but look out for a slightly odd and random crowd on Friday nights.  One night: an entire party of cougars hitting on a waiter, a drunk guy wandering from table to table in an attempt to watch the game, a bunch of townie girls trying to be \"classy\" and failing miserably (drunk plus booty shorts plus heels = No).  That said, drinks are strong, beer selection is nice, and food is pretty decent.  Not a bad choice for eats."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while and have finally came to try it out. Unfortunately they ran out of their cheese curds when we came, so we ordered their onion rings instead. They were the best I've had in years - very crunchy, not soggy at all. I had the original slider, which was flavorful and juicy, and the buffalo chicken one, which was also delicious. I shared the onion rings with my boyfriend and the 2 sliders which had me slightly full. Though I didn't get anything to drink that day, their menu was very extensive, which had me impressed. Definitely gonna come back for the cheese curds and possibly a drink... some time in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here tonight.  The sliders were great.....the onion rings were greasy and tasteless.   Service was excellent (but we arrived at the off-time of 4:30).  We would definitely stop here again for a quick bite to eat after work!"}
{"text":"Half price whiskey Wednesday. Need I say more? Ok a strong bench of whiskeys from around the world with sections of the menu on sale weekly on Wednesday evenings. Keeps uber drivers busy."}
{"text":"Good local pub. Had the triple combo with the california chicken slider, southwest salad and fresh fruit and the food was awesome. Will definately be back again. Service was a bit slow but it sure beats the chain resturants on the  other side of town. Great selection of sliders, soup, and salads. Extensive beer and wine list"}
{"text":"Two words - whiskey Wednesday! 50 percent off whiskey will always make me a happy person.. And this place has a lot else to offer, including yummy sliders and a pretty good alcoholic beverage offering. Definitely one of my favorite spots in downtown Champaign!"}
{"text":"Having only consumed their alcohol at an outdoor table, I can't really comment on the interior or the food.  However, a girl we were with kept praising the waffle fries.    I thought our drinks were served quickly & were reasonably priced, and I liked the fact that no one was trying to move us inside even though it was midnight and 8 of us were still sitting there.    I was surprised, and actually though our waitress was joking if, when we asked for the check, she asked if we wanted on check or separate checks.  I almost expect to get attitude from a server if a two-top asks for separate checks.  It took her awhile to sort everything out, but hey, she asked for it.  Kudos to her for making my life a little easier."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place is nice, unfortunately the people is very rude for big groups."}
{"text":"There was a ~20 minute wait to be seated and ~15 minute wait for food around 8:30 PM on Saturday night. However, they have vibrating buzzers that notify you when they have an opening, allowing you to wander around while waiting to be seated. The staff was friendly and regularly checked in on us to make sure everything was OK.  The sliders are their specialty, with their menu boasting over a dozen different kinds. Each is about the size of a tennis ball, so for a college-aged male, I'd recommend getting 3-4.  I got six of the sliders (shared with another person), and my favorites were the Chicago Hot Dog Slider and the BBQ Slider. Typically any single one of the ingredients in the Chicago Hot Dog Slider (pickle, green relish, mustard, peppers) tingles the mouth with its powerful sourness, but taking a bite of all of these together is a delicious explosion in the mouth. The BBQ Slider was a savory delight with a slice of meaty gouda, fatty bacon, rich BBQ sauce, and crispy onion ring."}
{"text":"Came here after reading the great reviews - went with the triple combo with the salmon salad, Italian wedding soup, and sliders. Filling lunch for only $10! Would love to come back to try out the other options.  This place was packed on a Wednesday at lunch - obviously others have caught on too!"}
{"text":"I just cannot get into this place.   Food is ok. I've had the buffalo sliders which are spicy, the cheeseburger one, which is ok, and the brat which is good. Not impressed with beer list. I guess I feel like I always go there and want it to be a bar, but it's more like I get trapped in a booth.  Some of their other food is not good (hummus, BLT, club sandwich). Drinks are ok."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine when I am in Champaign. The cheese curds and soft pretzel appetizers are spot on. Huge portions and big enough to share. I usually get the summer salmon salad, but I have tried many of the sliders, as well. 7 Saints is a popular restaurant and can get crowded fast. The waffle fries are also amazing."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Friday night, and although the staff was incredibly busy the guys at the bar were friendly and engaging, which is a huge plus in my book.   The selection of beers is excellent. He food is excellent as well. Nothing in the way of haute cuisine, just great food prepared extremely well. I had the club sandwich with onion rings--both were extremely tasty.   I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Seven Saints has actually become one of the places that I like to hang out most in downtown Champaign.   The manager is incredibly knowledgeable about different hard liquors and cocktails, especially. I've been to a couple tastings there where he has gone through how things are made and why they taste the way they do. He's super cool.  The whiskey selection is top notch, the beer selection is respectable, and the ambiance is great.  I've also had some of their other food, some of the sliders are really delicious as well as the salads. There are still some items that don't belong on the menu but the majority of their food is great.  I would definitely recommend this place to others. Yum."}
{"text":"I love this place and their \"Black & Bleu\" Salad is one of my favorites.  My daughter loves this place also as the sliders are perfect size for her.  It's one of the places I MUST eat at when I'm back on campus!"}
{"text":"Seven Saints is a genuinely great restaurant nestled in downtown Champaign. I've been here a few times and have had great experiences each and every time.  Their staff are always knowledgable and attentive. Their beer selection is quite good, mixing local beers with a good selection of craft and typical domestics. They're known for their sliders and rightfully so. I've tried nearly every one of them on the menu, and they're all uniquely delicious.  However, the hidden gem (literally) are their shrimp tacos. They're not listed on the menu, but they're available if you ask for them and they're incredible. Hands down, one of my favorite dishes I've ever had in C-U. Love Seven Saints, and will keep it in my rotation of frequented spots in C-U. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I definitely love this place. The food is amazing, no matter if you get a salad or a slider, or both! The service is always friendly and food never takes to long. I plan on coming here a lot more often now that I'm 21 and can actually drink with my meal."}
{"text":"Back in the day, Seven Saints was all anyone could ever talk about.  I remember all the kids running in talking about heading to Seven Saints for Three Fingers Grape. ;D  It was like a thing!  I always found Seven Saints a semi-meh experience.  A fairly interesting building.  Some history there.  But if I wanted history, I'd go downtown Urbana, sit at Blind Pig, or the old newspaper.  Favorites!  Seven Saints, as far as I was always concerned, was god-awful expensive.  And for food you could find pretty much anywhere.  Burgers, fries.  Simple standard sandwiches.    Hit or miss, but I'd say, especially for the money, hit up the diner a few blocks away.  You're going to get a much tastier experience, and service with smile."}
{"text":"Great good, amazing service! Had Maddie as a waitress and she was soooo wonderful! My dad was in the hospital and she could tell I was struggling- compassion with great food. We will bring friends in from out of town- salmon sliders a must, great portions, reasonable price. Salads fresh!!!!!!  Went back again- close to hospital- tried a couple new items/ salmon salad was good! Great service \"111\" excellent"}
{"text":"First time visiting here and loved the unique menu of sandwiches, salads, and sliders. I love how you can mix and match with different parts of the menu. The cheese curds were fantastic. Almost a pancake batter, without being sweet totally enveloping the curd. I also got the Mediterranean salad with the black jack slider. The salad was fresh and the slider was just totally fantastic. I can believe how this place is a community favorite."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Seven Saints? Love the Asian slider and wide selection of beers. The turkey burger is great too. My favorite appetizer is the warm pretzels with cheese dip. Nice atmosphere and fast and friendly servers too."}
{"text":"Paid our first visit this past Sunday after taking my daughter down to U of I.  The atmosphere is terrific with a beautiful bar area.    We ordered the pretzel with spicy cheese dip.  It was sufficient for 4 people although 2 of the pretzel sticks were slightly burnt.    I had the blackened rib-eye steak sandwich.  It was a nice portion although a bit messy with the sauce over soaking the bread causing it to fall apart.  I reverted to eating it with a fork and knife.  Also, I did not care for the flavor of the sauce but that's a personal preference I suppose. I had the onion rings as a side with my sandwich and they were quite good.    The rest of the family had half sandwiches and soup and seemed to enjoy them with no issue.    Our waitress was friendly and attentive as well.   I look forward to going there again and trying their sliders which they are known for."}
{"text":"The food was good: I ordered a slider, half a salad, and a raspberry iced tea. First off, their servings are TINY compared to the price. Was tempted to get two sliders, but stuck with one, and now am very hungry. Good slider, though. Not greasy, lightly toasted bun, crunchy bacon, and tender burger. The salad I got - country fried chicken - was AMAZING. Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy. I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes! By far my favorite part of the meal. Now. The iced tea. Nuh-uh. Is NOT raspberry flavored. Very small cup for the price. I stole my sister's sweet potato fries and eh... Guido's has better. Seven Saint's fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped. My friend said the beer selection, though large, didn't have what he really wanted. Also, he said the Seven Saint's salad is a little...offputting. The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make. The actual restaurant was pretty nice. Clean tables. The barstools weren't uncomfortably high. The service was nice, but slow. The server forgot my friend's beer, and was late with the drinks, but was very cheerful and helpful. My sister said the bathrooms were passable. Probably will come back, but will remember to get at least two sliders and a dinner-sized salad."}
{"text":"I really wish I loved this place more. You have no idea. I WANT to like it here.   The name is really cool, so I was hopeful. I was even more hopeful when my friend and I walked in. The design of this place is awesome. It's really nice looking with good lighting. It looks trendy and cool. Unfortunately, it's an illusion to cover up the rest of the place.   It's a pretty boring menu. It's American cuisine that focuses on slider-sized sandwiches. I had the fried chicken slider, and it was okay. Pretty much just literally fried chicken on a bun. It's not any better than I could have gotten at a fast food place, and for much cheaper. I wish I could have tried more sliders, but we were stopping in before a concert, so it was what it was. It's the kind of restaurant that is made to look like it's trendy but it's really just a normal joint with a nice paint job and design to it, and the ambiance isn't worth the extra price in my opinion.   The food isn't bad, just average. What really brings this rating down for me is the staff. The service is absolutely terrible. First of all, it was so slow. We ordered one slider each, it shouldn't take that long, especially when the restaurant is packed. Not only was our waitress slow, but she was unbelievably rude. The friend that I went with is male. I, obviously, am female. I might as well have not existed. All of the questions, flirtations, \"are you okays?\" were directed at him, and when I said anything, I got an eye roll and a curt nod. I get it. Guys will probably tip you better. But that's no reason to just blatantly be a terrible server, because we obviously came in together, so you should probably be nice to us together. He was embarrassed for both of us, and made a point to try and ask me questions in front of her, but she just was not getting the hint. It was awkward for both of us, and helped to ruin an otherwise lovely evening out.   I'd try this place again maybe if I'm ever in the neighborhood again, but I'd definitely be careful about in whose section I was seated. The second star of this review is for atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I avoided going here for dinner because I thought the prices would super high compared to the lunch menu, but I was wrong. They have the same menu & same prices for dinner as they do for lunch. Once for lunch I had the salmon salad (amazing), then had the tilapia tacos last week for dinner which were so-o-o-o good. So fresh with a super tasty creamy sauce. My husband had the ribeye sandwich that he was very happy with. Atmosphere is a little dark in the evening for my tastes, but during the day the plentiful windows let in lots of light."}
{"text":"Seven Saints is one of my favorite restaurants in the Champaign area. It's great quality food, especially for the price. The menu is also very creative. I have never been to a restaurant with it's own slider menu. And there's SO many great slider options. Some of my favorites include the California Turkey and BBQ slider.   Additionally, the service is always on point. The waiters are so polite and fast. My water is always filled and my requests are met right away.   The atmosphere is nice as well. It's dark, cozy, and comfortable but still feels more upscale than most places in Champaign. I would highly recommend Seven Saints to anyone looking for great food in the area."}
{"text":"I give it a three stars because the food tasted just okay and the service was slow. What we ordered was a tonic water and a IPA beer, one appetizer, and four sliders and a salad. We had two different servers and we stated we were hungry. And, what we got came in the following order: (1) a fast tonic water, and then, (2) a slow and not so generous portion of sweet potato fries; and then, (3) an even slower set of four different sliders, and (4) salad and then (5) my IPA beer.  Regarding the food, the salmon slider had a significant kick to it - I recommend it. But, there was no kick to the bratwurst with sauerkraut; the sauerkraut was bland and Dijon?  Also, the turkey slider had flavorless red peppers and would have benefited from larger slice of avocado or mashed avocado given the portion size. The others were not so worth mentioning.   Waiting for my beer and food seemed silly given that it seemed like a slow Tuesday night. This place earned its three because the salmon slider and fries were good and the beer list looked great. Maybe we just ordered wrong and had the wrong servers?"}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place, but the last few times I have been here, the food has been awful.  The bar is decent... but with all of those bottles, one would think the drink menu would be more expansive.  Best time to go is when you can sit outside.  However, that is less than a 3 month window... and outside of it, the ambiance is as cold as the weather.   Great location.  Make better use of it."}
{"text":"Gone down hill. I used to love their sliders and salads, but the service here is atrocious. The latest time I tried to go, we sat down and proceeded to be ignored for 30 minutes even as the servers saw us. Finally someone said they would get to us, but 10 minutes later, we just left. Oh, and this was a Monday night. It's worse on weekends."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to go to get some well-priced and delicious food on a night out. It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area.   Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options available, although few. Just above-par bar food good enough for a stop-in now and then if you're out for adult beverages.  Vegetarians should ask if there is egg in the buns used for the portabella burger.  Vegans are limited to salads minus cheese. And watch out for the dressings. Make sure you ask which ones are dairy-free.  Gluten-free folks be wary of the fries. I tried the sweet potato fries and I was fine afterward, but every gluten-free tummy is different and this place does not guarantee g/f fried foods. Also, if you are gluten-free and vegetarian going for the Boca Burger, remember that Boca uses wheat gluten in their burgers. They are not gluten-free.  The hummus was great, but it's served with pita bread, so that is a no-go for gluten-free folks. Maybe if I try this dish again I will ask for vegetable slices instead of pita bread. I'm not sure if they'll do it, but it can't hurt to ask.  My husband ordered two beers. One was warm, and the other tasted like dirty armpit. He was not a fan.  I had two glasses of Pinot Noir and they were fine. But for $9 a glass I want a wine that surpasses \"fine.\"  My husband and I each ordered a different salad, and both of us were unimpressed but not quite disappointed.  Apparently if you love bourbon this is the place to be. They have a huge selection.  The ambience is cleanly dim and almost classy. The staff is friendly. I will probably end up here again, and that will be just fine."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in champaign to eat at. I love the theme/decor of the whole restaurant! It is pretty intimate and has low lighting with huge gothic drapes..and good music is always playing. The food is amazing too. No matter what you order, you will be pleasantly surprised! The menu is very diverse/unique (good for picky eaters). I love the crab cake, salmon, and black and blue salads! The sliders and waffle fries are always great too. Im never disappointed! And the prices is very reasonable as well. They have pick two/three deals. Comparable to an an a lot more upscale/trendy panera!  They are open until 2 am, kitchen closes at 12 I believe, so its great for late nights. Love this place"}
{"text":"The sliders here are good...just a bit on the pricey side.  I had the buffalo chicken and it was awesome!  Then i had 1/2 a goat cheese salad which was also very good.   I ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer and that was a big mistake... The portion is huge.... They're the size of donut holes (like those ones you get at dunkin donuts) and you get like 12 of them in an order.  I was full after two.... I'm used to cheese curds being the size of popcorn....not golf balls.  And the breading on them is very heavy.  Other than that, i enjoyed the slider/salad combo."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken slider is my go to, always love this one.  The soups can also be good.  The largest whisky selection in the downstate area by a mile."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was severely lacking. On their menu, they have combos that are more expensive than buying the components separately. When I asked the waitress to order them separately, she seemed repulsed and upset that I was trying to cheat the system. My friend that I was here with also tried doing the same thing. Later she stopped by and said that the combo prices included tax so while I saved money my friend spent more. It was great to find out the reason the combo prices appeared more expensive on the menu, but the next thing the waitress did was unprofessional: she made a snark remark that my friend's higher price was our punishment for trying to pay less. Don't get me wrong, I still tipped 20% because I'm not a selfish man but that doesn't mean I am willing to throw my money away when there's something cheaper. I don't think I will be coming here again unless someone insists."}
{"text":"Cheese Curd Heaven at \"Gourmet White Castle!\"  Slide on over to Seven Saints, a trendy, burger bar specializing in sliders in Champaign, IL. It offers house-made, hand-pattied beef sliders with a variety of gemlicious topping combos and complimentary lettuce, tomatoes, pickles & onions upon request. If beef isn't your baby, don't fret, there are plenty of other protein options or try em all: hand-made, seasoned turkey patty, salmon, bratwurst, hotdog, blt, grilled chicken, fried chicken patty, and boca burgers are also available as slider options.   Also, Seven Saints has a gemload of yummy salads, sides and apps. You can order things a la carte, or they offer mix & match combo platters (e.g. choose a slider, 1/2 salad & a side, the \"Triple S Combo\" for $9.79 or choose a slider & a 1/2 salad for $7.99, etc.). I got the original turkey slider with lettuce, tomato & pickle & a 1/2 order of the Greek salad. As an app, I ordered the cheese curds, and on a subsequent visit I got a side order of sweet potato fries.   For starters, the cheese curds here are the best ones I've ever had! They are made in-house, lightly beer-battered & are like giant marshmallows stuffed with gooey, white cheddar cheese. They will cost you $8.49 out of pocket & set you back about 2 weeks worth of calories & cholesterol, but they alone are worth the road trip to Champaign!  My turkey burger slider was a little larger than a silver dollar. It was nothing extraordinary but was fresh, not greasy & pretty tasty, a solid 4 stars. The mini bun was nice & soft too.   I also got the half order of the Greek salad which is field greens tossed in a traditional Greek vinaigrette with cucumbers, kalmata olives, red onions, pepperoncinis, fire-roasted artichokes & is topped with feta cheese. It was really flavorful, fresh & tasty, and I would re-order it!   I don't order sweet potato fries that often but ordered them here because they were crinkle-cut which I rarely see. I'm glad I did because they were some of the best SPF I've ever had. At some places, the customary straight ones are either limp/soggy with no crispiness or overly sweet with some unwelcome/unwanted surprise, sugary-coating basted all over them. These guys were soft on the inside with a perfect, crispiness on the outside (kind of like White Castle's regular fries), and they weren't doused in any surprise, sugary-coating. They had a nice, natural sweet potato taste, 5 gems for taste & texture!   Last thing, this bar is well-stocked for the most part. It has a gemload of liquor & craft beers. I tried Rain Organic Vodka on the rocks with regular olives for the first time. I didn't really care for it because it's a lil harsh with a sweet after taste. If I ever come back, I will just stick to Chopin Vodka, since they didn't have Ciroc Vodka, my fave (boo).   All in all, my experience at Seven Saints was pretty heavenly. The service here is decent but needs a slight tune up. The bartenders were friendly but service was a lil slow & scattered for my taste (however not Denny's-Champaign, IL slow, thank heavens!), almost a 4 though. The cheese curds & sweet potato fries were the saints of the show, and I do like all of the various slider & salad options on the menu. (Think gourmet White Castle with salads & booze too!)  It's dark & nice inside, and they are striving for a Wicker Park-like, Chicago bar feel. So if you ever find yourself in Champaign, IL, I recommend dining & drinking at this gemlicious, slider-burger bar as it was one of my fave places I visited in Champaign, a solid, high 4 gems!"}
{"text":"This place is \"known\" for their sliders and I was impressed with the fact that they offered a vegetarian boca burger patty as a substitute for all their burgers. I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it. Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though."}
{"text":"We waited 15 minutes for waitress to return to take our order. The sliders were greasy and bacon was undercooked. Was once our favorite, sadly no longer."}
{"text":"The interior is nice looking and dimly lit, and Whiskey Wednesday is a fun gimmick but the food...is meh. If you order sliders they just come out on a giant white plate and it sort of detracts from the food. I'm serious--it's a big plate without even so much as a green piece of garnish and the sliders are just okay anyway. The service is average though servers can seem scarce because it's always so dang busy."}
{"text":"Nice ambience ... Good food .. Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Seven Saints has consistently good food and good service.  It's not a gastropub or Michelin-star restaurant.  Rather it's a solid local hangout that always delivers.  We had crab cakes, the Salmon Salad and the BLT.  All three were very tasty and affordable.  Had not been here for a few years, glad to see they are not only still around but that they remain on top of their game.

{"text":"Went in tonight for a bite and drinks with two of my friends and were seated right away. After 15 minutes went by and we hadn't been greeted or acknowledged by serve staff yet the table behind us had been visited twice for drink refills, we decided to take off for another restaurant that would actually appreciate our business. On our way out, two servers setting in the front wrapping silverware made it obvious that side work and getting out at the end of their shift was their priority. Don't think I'll ever come back to give another shot, menu and beer selection were small and unimpressive anyway."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU. First of all, the atmosphere is really amazing. A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special. It has a slightly dark, gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting. I do wish the space was a bit bigger, however, as it can get busy very quickly and you'll run out of places to sit.  Service-wise I've almost always had great service. The wait-staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive. They have a nice selection of spirits. The best part has to be the food, though. They have a nice selection of salads. My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.  Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.  Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers."}
{"text":"Loved the style and ambiance of the place. Very laid back, but classy as well. The waiter was so nice and answered any and all questions I had about the very, very large liquor menu. My husband and I got the 1/2 salad 1/2 soup option which is a very nice price! The vegetable soup was very hardy and our salads were delicious. Would definitely go back if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"The ambiance probably beats the food. The steak salad. Warning, it might not be edible. Last time I tried it, it tasted like the sea. Salt city. Same could be said for the salmon sliders. Aside from this unpleasant surprise, everything else on the menu tasted pretty good. The alcohol selection, service, and vibe of the place were perfectly lovely, however. Food, less so..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Champaign. Cheese curds are a must when you eat here, and their tomato bisque soup is delicious as well. Sliders are great too! They always have a great selection of seasonal drafts as well.   Definitely a place to check out in the CU area.  Can get crowded on the weekends and it is a smaller restaurant, if it isn't nice outside you will be cramped with the others waiting for a table at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been back with friends twice after the server and manager argued that we were not waiting for the 20 minutes we had been. Both times we received unfriendly and inattentive service. I figured my first visit was an anomaly and found out from those that I visited with that the service is consistently bad.   The food: the cheese curds are okay. I'm not sure why everyone thinks they are so incredible? Maybe the massive size? The sliders are pretty good, but I don't think the quality warrants the price. I had the black and blue salad and it was a huge portion for a half size which was awesome! But the taste was not there. It was pretty awful. I couldn't eat it and just enjoyed my baby sized burger instead.   The best time to come would probably be Whiskey Wednesday. Come drunk and get drunker and the terrible food and service won't be an issue."}
{"text":"If the server wouldn't of been so snotty I would of loved it more. Food was great. Booze was top shelf.  Come on a night where they r putting on a talk!!"}
{"text":"My biggest disappointment probably stems from how much my friends talked this place up, and the service & food quality falling so very short of expectations.    Regardless of \"how\" or \"why\", the food was sub-par, especially for the price, and the service was what we've all come to expect from fast food employees.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places in town. Whenever going out to eat with friends, this is literally the first thing I suggest each time if that puts anything into perspective.   They are known for their awesome sliders. An entire page of their menu is dedicated to these little guys and they come in a huge variety of flavors/meats/etc. My personal favorite thing I eat there is the Seven Saints salad. I always substitute the sirloin for salmon and it's to die for. They are always so accommodating and will help you adjust your order however you need it to be.  Great service, ambiance, and cuisine. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday, March 15th, 2014.  Yow.  We ordered our drinks, and they came out quick.  We followed that with an order of cheese curds which were pretty good overall.  From there, it was sliders and salad or sides.  I ordered the Jack slider, and it was pretty darn good.  The food came out fairly fast, and the prices didn't break the bank.  One weird thing - employees wore numbers instead of names.  I had visions of \"The Prisoner\" flash through my head \"I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered - my life is my own.\"    The restrooms were clean.  All in all, a good visit."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was awesome and filling. I think we'll be making a trip back before we leave town"}
{"text":"came here for a friend's birthday recently.  the food was alright, just a bit too greasy and unoriginal.  as another dining companion put it, they have good ideas but the execution was off.  the drink i ordered, \"the maple leaf\" with canadian whiskey, lemon and maple syrup was a bit too sweet, i had to thin it out with water.  i'll most certainly be back...but seven saints was certainly nothing to \"write home about.\""}
{"text":"Amazing selection of whiskey which automatically earns it 5 stars in my book! They also carry a good selection of beers, they also have the left hand milk stout which is one of my favorite beers ever. Food is absolutely amazing as well, great place for late night drinks and snacks. Can't go wrong with the pretzels!"}
{"text":"Our U of I freshman son suggested coming here for a late lunch as we were returning from FL on our way home to the Chicago suburbs. What a fun surprise this place was! The decor was rich and inviting on a cold snowy April Fools Day. Each of us had different sliders (the salmon one was delicious) and assorted sides and salads. The Black & Bleu salad had big pieces of tender, flavorful steak sprinkled with blue cheese, meaty mushrooms and sautéed onions. It was beyond my expectations in size and taste. Service was attentive, but not intrusive. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The sliders are good, and they have decent selection of draft beers (including Rogue Dead Guy!).  The asian slider is average, because the wasabi mayo could have used a little more of the wasabi.  The smokey bacon cheese slider was awesome for a person who likes to be kicked in the teeth with flavor:  crispy bacon, smokey BBQ sauce, smoked cheddar.  My wife ordered the coup de grace: the tropical slider with grilled pineapple and thai peanut sauce.  Since you might order 2 or 3 sliders anyway, this one is well worth trying!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, Figgy was my bartender, very knowledgeable on his spirits and craft cocktails.  Made a mean old fashioned, which I can appreciate.  Service was great and food was pretty good.  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BLT salad is wonderful and the salmon sliders rock. The tomato bisque is really wonderful."}
{"text":"My favorite place for: Whiskey Wednesday,  giant cheese curds, and tomato bisque soup."}
{"text":"7 Saints has a pious name and heavenly grub.  I love their mixing and matching with their 3 S combos.  I typically get a slider, salad, and soup for slightly over 10 bucks.  I encourage you to trust your instincts on which ones to choose, as I have not met one that I did not like.  I usually eat all the food, b/c I'm American.  I leave sufficiently full, but don't hate myself so I'd say it's just right :)  This place does not take reservations and I've waited for up to an hour before.  Therefore, it may not be the best place to hit up during prime time hours if you have plans afterwards."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an amazing menu! There is something for everyone. The sliders are great, the salads are great, the soups are great! My favorite item on the menu is the cheese curds appetizer. They also have a diverse beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm from California here in Champaign on business and gave this place a try. The sliders were delicious and full of flavor (had the BBQ one and one with pineapple) and they had a great selection of beer. I'll give it try again tomorrow for some of the sliders."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and decor more than the food. The food is good, however it's a pretty straight forward menu: soups, salads, sandwiches/sliders. I only want that every so often. Great place to get drinks and a couple appetizers in the main room. It's dark and plush and lighting is great."}
{"text":"We always, always stop here when we are in town. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at Seven Saints.  Firstly, there's an expansive beer and whiskey list. In terms of appetizers--we are hardly ever people who order starters, but we usually do here. Fried mushrooms, cheese curds, onion rings--they're all good and don't make you feel gross afterwards like some other places do.  The salads are big and hearty. Sliders offer lots of options. And their menu allows you to mix and match things to meet your taste. Personally I like the red pepper gouda soup when they have it and the southwest chipotle chicken salad.   The wait staff is friendly, but not what I'd call amazing. The vibe inside feels warm and plush. Overall, if this place was in my neighborhood, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Good bar and restraint concept.  Lots of craft beer selections, specialty drinks and good wines by the glass.  The menu was perfect for me. Smaller portions - Seven Saints specializes in sliders and there must have been 20 choices - burgers, salmon, bacon, BBQ, vegetarian, etc.  I did a mix and match with sliders, soup of the day and a salad.  Our server, Grant, was informative and helpful, while being witty and funny. Sometimes a waiter makes the meal memorable and Grant certainly made our night seem special.  The place does not take reservations, and it can get busy.  Worth the wait.  Parking nearby can be problematic, but then again the bar and food overcome that minor detail."}
{"text":"Food and drinks here are amazing. Ambience is cool and romantic. People are nice what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed with this place. Last night, I ate here and ordered the Tomato and Pesto grilled cheese.  Huge mistake.  My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard, dried to the bread, cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast.  It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down.  So not worth it- flavorless and disgusting.  Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there.  OK for drinks, but avoid the food. Oh, and don't bother complaining to the GM, Andy.  He could care less. Way to keep customers."}
{"text":"When at U of I, we invariably end up at Seven Saints.  We might have wanted to go somewhere else, but some weekends are so hard to get a table at the local restaurants.  Seven Saints always seems to be able to accommodate, and although I never think the service is spectacular, I can overlook that for the great burgers, pub atmosphere and drink selection.  I'll be back......"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite bars, which is funny, because I've never had a drink here! I just come for the food (sliders and salads here are great) and atmosphere. I took my parents here for lunch, too. I'd say skip this place for lunch. Portions are kind of small for the price if you want an actual meal. Great light fare though. Plus, it's way prettier at night.  ---  Finally tried some cocktails here... they were not well made. No flavor, no bite, everything tasted like sugar water. I tried the portobello sandwich with fruit. Fruit was ... I didn't understand it. Everything, the food ... all of it... was so poor. Way too expensive for an awful and basic, bland meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Seven Saints when I'm in town. They've got a crazy selection of alcohol and at quite reasonable prices (at least the gin). The sliders are quite tasty. I had the salmon one which was definitely good and I also got the BBQ, which was as good as I had it on my previous visit. I believe on my first visit I also got the one with the pineapple and that was kinda wacky but still really tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm just so-so about the food, but I just saw someone else had fried cheese curds there.  I'll have to try those yet.  Hard liquor selection is just f-ing amazing!!!!   Sooooo worth the visit.  The liquor they carry alone is worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Seven Saints when other bars can be so crowded, especially on the weekends. The service is usually (but not always) friendly, with a good wine and beer selection. The food can be pretty \"meh.\" I've tried their appetizers, salads, sliders, and desserts and nothing has blown me away. What really wins me over is how chill it usually is in there, and the layout, furniture, atmosphere of the interior. I recommend it, especially if you're not interested in a crazy night on the town."}
{"text":"Great little place in Champaign.  I've eaten here twice when driving through the area.  Love the cheese curds, they are so huge.  I normally get the mix n match with a slider/salad and side.  More than enough food and good quality.  Nice atmosphere inside as well."}
{"text":"Had some sliders that were delicious as well as a couple drinks. Service wasn't too bad, and had a lot of workers hanging around the front and goofing off I guess. Server vanished for a bit at the end as well. The food was delicious though."}
{"text":"We were in town for a short event and went here for dinner. We all liked it so much we came back for lunch the next day.   The flavor combinations were interesting and delicious!  And the menu allows you to mix and match almost any assortment of salad, side, slider, sandwich and soup for VERY reasonable prices.  Between 6 people and 2 meals with almost everyone trying 2-3 items each time, no one was disappointed with their choices. If I lived in the area this would be a regular stop."}
{"text":"You know, I really wanted this to be a 5-star joint.  I love the ambiance of the corner bar, dark wood, and dimly lit interior and the extensive offerings of specialty vodkas, gins, and whiskeys.  The cheese curd appetizer was very good but not out of this world.  The beer batter was a little soft and I suspect the cheese had not been frozen prior to deep frying (or not completely), which resulted in most of the cheese over-melting and dripping out of the solidified batter shell.  Still tasty, but missing the mark a little bit.  The sliders were pretty good, but the BBQ had too much botte-tasting sauce on it.  The beef was cooked perfectly though.  Caesar salad was average at best.  On the plus side, they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it has been a good experience. The sliders are great and keeps people coming back. I really enjoy the chili and any salad with the marinated sirloin. The have an endless list of drinks. If you're looking for fun place to go out check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend who is currently in grad school at U of I and with another friend just passing through Chambana for few hours.  In short, we just needed a place to catch up and Seven Saints provided that and more!  On a Sunday evening, we were seated outside immediately and our waiter was accommodating and attentive without hovering.  We each ended up going with the slider and salad combo with sweet potato fries on the side.  I chose the salmon slider (complete with cucumber and dill sauce) and the salmon salad (a more Mexican take with a southwest ranch dressing) & I was extremely content with my choices; even having some leftovers for lunch the next day!  In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable.  The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato chips with goat cheese dip are phenomenal - perfect combo of sweet and salty.  Sliders are decent - left a little to be desired but overall good. Salads are fresh, tasty - really a lot of great options, nice atmosphere and extensive drink list."}
{"text":"a cool looking American pub with decent food but a small serving of fries with the meal. This is a classic college bar in this college town and pretty much the service was decent enough. The layout is great with outdoor seating in the warm months and there is plenty of cool seating and beers to choose form in a visit of this bar."}
{"text":"I love this place for one simple reason: its good drinks + good sliders + goos ambience all in one. Everything is just good enough, but it has all three! I would bring anyone from out of town here because palate wise, everyone is likely to find something here. Good date place too, and people are audible  despite the music playing in the background...which builds the ambience."}
{"text":"Love this place. We just moved back to Danville, IL and we can see ourselves traveling to Champaign just to partake in all the splendor of Seven Saints!  They specialize in sliders and oh my gosh they do them well. We ordered 3 to share. We shared the salmon slider, chicago style slider and a basic bacon cheeseburger. I'll start with the bacon cheeseburger. It was good.  I would describe it as very hardy and well seasoned. The salmon slider was awesome.  Very fresh. Loved the dill sauce and the cucumber was crispy and perfect. Ok so now my favorite...the Chicago style hotdog. The sliced the whole hotdog so it would fit on the bun. They added all of the usual suspects, bright green relish, pickles, hot pepper and tomato AND the nicest surprise...poppy seeds on the normal (yet tasty) slider bun. Not sure how much or for how long you can savor a slider, but I tried. Mmmm. We sat at the bar and conversed with the friendly bartender, figgy. He was so nice and great about making recommendations. They feature some great craft beers. We enjoyed two different ones by the local brewery (Savoy, IL) Triptych. Husband ordered the IPA and I had the red ale. Perfect combination with the sliders we chose. All in all this was a great find for us."}
{"text":"Cheese curds taste so good here. Many choices for sliders and they taste good too. Nice environment and the server was very nice and friendly. Great place!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Seven Saints got off to a slow start. We asked to be seated outdoors,the weather was nice and their curbside tables are nice. Well we sat for 20 min and no waitress. There were three outside but no one stopped at our table. I finally stopped the young man at the front door and he quickly found us someone to take our order. Hey everybody has an off night!  My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse. We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended! We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone. All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and our waitress( once we got one) was on the ball and friendly. We will be returning and I would recommend Seven Saints to our friends."}
{"text":"When I first tried this place out I was like, \"yea it's ok\" but then I went back three different times with 3 different friends who all love it. One. Cheese Curds, don't tell your weight watcher leader, but order them and thank me later. The black and blue salad was OUT OF THIS WORLD good! Yum! The speciality drinks of the night have never failed me. Good! I even like mine a little sweeter, so I told my waitress and she just had them add a little simple syrup to my liking. :) There's that excellent service for you! I'm now officially a big fan!"}
{"text":"Ribeye special tonight -- it's partially on me for ordering it at a pub -- the steak was more like a medium well sirloin (lean, tough) instead of a medium ribeye. Good flavor, just not the best cut of meat. Had a great stout on draft, Camp Waconda, but the Old Fashioned erred too much on the side of muddled orange and not enough on bourbon and bitters for my palate. Would give it another try but I'd certainly order a pint and a cheaper menu item."}
{"text":"Everyone knows this place is known for their sliders, and they are certainly worth a try.  I liked them enough to go back a few times while living in the area, and always had a good service and good food.  Never tried anything outside of the sliders."}
{"text":"This review is brought to you by the letter S.   S: liders galore offered here! There's a whole page of them on the menu. I tried the one with fried jalapeños on it and didn't have a problem polishing it off.  S: alads are another 's' that this place serves up. Must be atleast 12 different choices.  S: alty was my Seven Saints salad bc of the seasoning on the beef. It also came with cashews.  S: atisfied by my combo entree of a slider, 1/2 salad, and choice of side.  S: ervice was friendly on the outside patio."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, parking can be challenging but worth the walk.  Full bar with great service...Never had a bad meal here.  Nice place for a date or a night out with a few friends.  Strong Recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a quick lunch at Seven Saints with a lovely friend on a sunny afternoon. We opted to sit outside and were immediately given a table. We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer, and I had a grilled chicken slider with the goat cheese salad. I absolutely recommend the cheese curds - they were my favorite part of the meal. The slider was a little dry for me, but the salad was very good!   Our server was very friendly and quick, and the location is perfect if you work near downtown Champaign. From what I saw inside the restaurant, it looked like a pretty calm atmosphere. Outside seating is very good!   Overall, if you're looking for a lunch place, Seven Saints is a great choice. They offer a wide variety of options to fit almost anyone's palate!"}
{"text":"Whiskey Wednesday is a great time to come! Many people love their sliders but I think they are just OK. My favorite is the sweet chips. Sweet potato chips with a goat cheese dip. Great place to hang out, nice atmosphere, good drinks, and tasty food."}
{"text":"Love their sliders and soups. I always go for the soup of the day -always a good deal. Oh and did I mention their seven sinners platter?"}
{"text":"Almost everything here is a la carte but there are pick-2 and pick-3 combos. The Black Jack Slider is consistently good. The Classic Slider was nothing special. Even though I lurve a good tomato bisque, this one didn't stand out.The beer is good though there seem to be only a handful on tap. I feel the prices are a little high to pay for average food.  The atmosphere is dark and intimate because of the booth seating; but it is loud and often busy so the service is so-so. There is also outdoor seating but it is right on a downtown street so it can be busy. Bike parking is also right there in front so while it is convenient for cyclists, it can get in the way of the outdoor seating. For autos, there's metered street parking and a pay-to-park lot across the street."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a night cap before taking the train and our waitress Hannah was absolutely awesome!  She went above and beyond to accommodate us!  Thanks Hannah!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good location. Friendly atmosphere. Sliders to die for. Great drink selection. Drunk pecan pie with ice cream to die for again."}
{"text":"The Boy and I came here because we saw a Capital Brewery sign floating in the window like a neon beacon of hope and happiness.  We sat at the bar and perused the beer list.  Sadly, the only Capital beer they had came in the form of cans of the Island Wheat.  Ew, and oh no.  Fortunately, the rest of the beer list was fairly extensive and diverse.  But what's this?  Cheese curds?!  Oh, Seven Saints.  You have cut to the core of this simple Wisconsin girl.   So, we ordered the cheese curds, a Rogue Dead Guy Ale and an Anchor Steam (solid beer choices, if you're in the market). The cheese curds were not cheese curds.....they were palm-sized balls of mozzarella with a light, gooey breading on them.  And they came with a delicious marinara sauce.  Let me tell you something: These 'curds' are not f'n around.  They are formidable.  We couldn't finish them, they were so heavy.  How is it that Illinois managed to out-fat bastard Wisconsin?  Go figure.    Seven Saints is a very pretty bar, at least at night.  All espresso-dark wood and nice lighting.  And the jukebox was interesting.  When we first got in there, the crowd all seemed slightly older....so it was very odd that some new hip hop/hump dancey song was bumping over the stereo.  Swiftly and even more randomly, the jukebox changed over to super hits of my early adolescence: Blind Melon, Spin Doctors, and even some Van Halen.  I was okay with this, if not a little more than amused.  When it comes right down to it, we all know I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Consistently has pretty good service. Their wine selection is somewhat wanting, but the beer and spirit menus are great. Pretty good pub food, more so if you're a meat eater, but definitely doable for vegetarians. It's always super clean, too."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for my birthday! Wonderful food and drinks and great service in a beautiful atmosphere!! We loved it and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from Seven Saints, yet somehow I still left disappointed.  There doesn't appear to be a beer menu, perhaps because they're really proud of their Jameson and Red Bull cocktails (ick) and would rather advertise those on your table.  This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.  The food menu was more promising.  It's split into two parts:  half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \"sliders\".  Upscale White Castle.  Frankly, the food wasn't particularly bad.  My friend enjoyed his salad.  But it wasn't particularly good either:  his slider was only so-so and my sandwich was like a salt lick.  But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn't sucked.  When our waitress finally got around to us, I ordered a sandwich.  She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a \"permanent substitution\" with that item.  By substitution, she meant that it was nothing at all like the description - perhaps it still had the same kind of bread.  When I told her I didn't want this new sandwich, she made a big deal out of me being \"too picky,\" and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her.  \"Permanent substitution\"?  Seriously, print new menus and lose the attitude."}
{"text":"Seven Saints is a fantastic establishment to eat. Friendly..clean...fast service and the food is wonderful. Not expensive and the menu is not complicated. Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Really yummy! Hopped by before my Amtrak back to Chicago for a quick dinner (and I mean, quick, I only had an hour before the train left!)  Get the soup, salad, and slider combo. 3 meals in one for less than $10, and all the portions were extremely generous, you'd almost mistake this for diner and not pub/lounge prices!  The salad I chose was the salmon one, and the salmon piece was giant...much larger than I expected, and grilled to the perfect juiciness, not too dry and not too salty...pairing perfectly with the avocado (so so decadent). The slider was amazing...i thought it'd be too small but it's actually the same size as the Shake Shack chicken burgers (which is ridiculous imo), perfectly juicy, with cheese and bacon wedged in between a really large piece of beef O.o And of course the soup was great...not too creamy with bits of chicken...and I know this sounds bad, but it's like the cross of a panera bread and olive garden creamy corn and chicken soup (both of which I love).  Would love to try their other options, and I'll definitely have to see what those \"whisky wednesdays\" are that I've heard about!"}
{"text":"I've come here two nights in a row and my friend and I got the different wine from the  selection they have and we loved everything we had. Breaded Green Beans and Black Jack Sliders are the best!"}
{"text":"As usual great food, the downside of this visit was our server (#030). Through out our meal, she never stopped by to check-in. However we noticed she asked the table across from us as well as the tables on each side of us about their food and how things were going. We had to ask @ the soup options. I've counted at least 5 visits to the table across from us to the one where she took our order. Someone else brought us or food. It has seriously been 30 minutes since our waitress has stopped by. We had to stop another waitress for service. The roaming person with water provided better service than our server. I like Seven Saints and will be back, just hope I never have this server again. Not even a here you go and have a nice day when she brought us our checks. Seriously, not sure what went wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"Every friend I have in the area just RAVES about this restaurant and its sliders, but i just dont see it. I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.    The building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.    I had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.     As for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid?   The one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.  I want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option."}
{"text":"All around amazing food. Big menu with lots of choices for everyone. My favorite starter is the sweet chips and I highly recommend them if you like both sweet potatoes ad goat cheese. It is a big portion so I suggest sharing, that goes with all their appetizers.  As far as for my meal I love getting the 1 slider 1/2 salad combo platter. My favorite salad is the goat cheese salad. It comes with fresh strawberries, grapes and candied walnuts with an amazing raspberry vinaigrette on the side. For the slider, I like to get the tropical stack, being vegetarian I opt for the boca burger and it tastes great. It comes with a warm grilled pineapple and delicious peanut sauce.  I've also heard great things about the grilled cheese with tomato bisque soup. I will have to try it next time I am there!"}
{"text":"Came here last night about 8pm. The ambience is nice almost like a downtown Chicago feel and the food is good too. Notice I said good, cuz the $4 sliders I had were decent but not worth it. I tried a local Triptych Brewing beer called Blueberry Blonde that they had on tap & it was fairly warm but gud. All in all I had a mediocre experience but I will giv em another shot."}
{"text":"My wife and in went here about six months ago. The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something.  We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer. My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good, along with a nice Tomato Bisque. I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.  I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.  The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.  Service was friendly.  I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat."}
{"text":"I love Seven Saints!  Everything, the food, the beers (good selection of bottle beers and there is always some special on the draft), the fantastic whisky selection (probably the best in town), the bartenders (always helpful and friendly, definitely worth a big fat tip!).  Tuesday the draft beers are half-price and Wednesday one type of whisky is half-price (I mean or Bourbon, or Scotch, or American... ok, u get the point).  You definitely need to try the sliders, they are what make the bar famous. Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).  There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.  Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasant experience. So much so that we planned a visit based on our dining experience last year and stopped in twice over two days this time around.   The establishment is reasonably priced despite its swanky decor. My boyfriend say their Gibsons are some of the best he has tasted in a while and were equally as good even when prepared by two different bartenders. I wish there were more fruity cocktails but prefer to eat my calories over drinking them anyway.   We ordered:   Triple S combo (1/2 salad, slider and one side) - $9.79. I had the summer salmon salad, black jack slider and my beloved broccoli salad.  I absolutely loved all three and would order them again.  The salmon was marinated and very moist. Well done and accordingly to the server a better choice over the salmon slider.   Chili with cheese and onions - $4  Very hearty and perfect for a cool day paired well with a cold beer."}
{"text":"The staff is kind of rude and if you do not tell the staff not to burn the shit out of your hamburgers they will burn them to death"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today for the first time.  The ambience and atmosphere is GREAT.  Beer selection, ditto.  Food was pretty good but I had the salmon slider and as some others have noted, it was too salty.  I also ordered it with lettuce and tomato (the waiter specifically asked me if I wanted any extras) but then it arrived with only the toppings listed in the menu.  7 Saints Salad was good, my husband's burger slider and Caeser Salad were good.  We enjoyed the hummus appetizer.  So overall a positive experience but not perfect."}
{"text":"I am torn over what to do with Seven Saints.  When I first went there I thought the food was great and the drinks were wonderful.  Over time, it has lost its luster.  What follows is my progression.  My first visit was mostly about the drinks.  I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night).  I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it.  Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more.    My next visit included food and drinks.  I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable.  I had the salmon slider to eat.  I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich.  When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner.  Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food.  I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck.  After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.  I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup.  I recommend both options.  The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese.  This was also wonderful.  In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch.  Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich.  I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead.  When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich.  There should have been American cheese as well.  I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.  The last straw was yesterday.  I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup.  Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone.  When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese.  There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey.  It was toasted and crispy.  Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop.  I found the sandwich to be dry.   From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks.  Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town.  I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place.  I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great.  However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?"}
{"text":"Love the lively environment here and whiskey Wednesday makes me happy. The sliders are pretty good and the cheese curds really are great. But none of the food really stands out to me and some of the combos don't make any sense (sometimes cheaper to just buy each individually). Regardless, Seven Saints is definitely an enjoyable place downtown."}
{"text":"When you come here just order the salads, sliders, and soups. Really anything else isn't worth it. I ordered a steak sandwich medium and it was definitely well done. I don't mind well done, but the fact is it wasn't what I ordered. The best day to come is Whiskey Wednesday. Every Wednesday, their whiskey half off depending on the type of whiskey and it's by far their best selling point. The wait staff is great and attentive. Just stick to the whiskey, salads, and curds."}
{"text":"Like the ambience and the unique takes on basic bar food. The cheese curds are a great variation on fried mozzarella sticks. The sliders are fun and tasty with a nice selection for all palettes. Soups, salads and sandwiches are all good too. Not what you would expect in a college town. No pennants on the wall and pizza on the menu. Liked the decor and the service too. Street parking wasn't a problem on a Monday.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Definitely had a lot of slider choices.  I arrived late to a group, so I have to base my review just on the two sliders I ordered.  I got a classic with cheese and a California turkey slider.  Classic was very tasty - but then you shouldn't mess up what it a classic.  And other slider places have done as well as this one was.  California turkey was good for what it was, but turkey burger leaves a bit to be desired.  Not Seven Saints' fault, but don't put something on the menu that isn't going to be really good."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere , just a sandwich place. I guess they're known for their drinks. Not much variety but I loved my Ribeye Sandwich and platter !"}
{"text":"We had dinner here during my sons college trip. The food was excellent and a great value. Coming from Boston, we were blown away by the reasonable prices. Loved the selection of craft beers. Ambiance and decor was also beautiful."}
{"text":"I graduated from U of I 8 years ago and to this day I still think about how good Seven Saints is-so naturally when I came back for a visit this was first of my list to stop for lunch! The atmosphere is cozy with long, elegant curtains surrounding the entrance as you walk in and we didn't have to wait even though it was lunch time. Call me a child, but my favorite thing to order here is the grilled cheese-but it's honestly the best grilled cheese I've yet to come across. It's pretty large with cheddar and provolone on sourdough bread. So cheesy, so heavenly. It comes with a side and I got the waffle fries, which are perfectly crispy and so yummy too. I also got a cup of the tomato soup (when you order grilled cheese, you need tomato soup) - that was amazing as well.  There are tons of options to pick from on the menu and also lots of options to mix and match (1/2 sandwich + soup etc). Our food came out lightening fast and had friendly service. Next time I'm back in Champaign, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Lots of people love this place, but I've always left feeling underwhelmed. Their food doesn't taste much different than what one could get at a chain restaurant. I've been here twice. The first time I had a slider with waffle fries. The bread was a little too sweet for my taste and the burger was well cooked, but didn't seem to have been spiced well. The waffle fries tasted like something I could get at any greasy spoon.   The second time around, I had some of the famous cheese curds and a small salad. The cheese curds tasted like something I could get at applebees and I thought the crust was too sweet. The salad was fine, but   Also, the noise level is pretty high here. I'm not sure if it's less loud outside, but in the back dining room I had to nearly scream for my friend next to me to hear me.  I will say the service was excellent and they were clearly trying to keep their customers happy.  Overall, not worth the cost, I think."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, long velvet drapes, high backed wooden booths, staff that knows their stuff, great brew menu, well located near parking and transit."}
{"text":"Waitress was awesome! Joyful and talkative! She took care of our group of 9! Food was phenomenal and the crumb Burle Nutella cheesecake was mouth watering! Highly recommend the typical slider, goat cheese salad and sweet potato fries! Their hummus is homemade and was one of the best I've tasted!"}
{"text":"Man, every time I've gone to this place, the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I've found all the food to be incredibly bland. Disappointing because the atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken flautas here, absolutely delicious. I also had the flower power drink but it wasn't as good as I expected. Neat place!"}
{"text":"While traveling I often eat at pubs and Seven Saints is on the high end of the list for good pub grub. I was told they were famous for their sliders, so I chose the Chicago Dog slider, mainly because I love Chicago Dogs and also because it was out of the ordinary. The slider was very good, but a little overpriced. Not wanting to fill up on just sliders, I also got the Chipotle salad which was very well done and was tasty and surprisingly filling for a salad.   I enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing. The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I often judge a place by asking myself if I would go back again.  For Seven Saints, the answer would be yes, if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go way out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere of Seven Saints is great. They have great combo deals and the price you are paying for the quality of the food is cheap in my opinion!   Only complaint is that I once had a waitress that seemed unhappy to serving my table for no valid reason what so ever... We generously tipped her over 20% even though she wasn't very friendly or welcoming. Also had a young hostess seat us at a shabby table between the exit and kitchen once which was off putting considering there were other tables open... However overall a good place if you're looking for some good food!"}
{"text":"As many others have said the cheese curds are amazing here. The menu has a good variety of different sliders and I would have loved to try more but those cheese curds were just too filling. The sweet potato fries are also very good and crinkle cut which was a pleasant surprise.   The service was so so and is the reason it's only 3 stars instead of 4. Our waitress seemed like she always had something more important to take care of and was slow on some basic requests.   Overall a good experience and am looking forward to another visit"}
{"text":"Out of towners,.went downtown,found this place word of mouth..nice place,old,i had 2 sliders and potato soup fries,,awesome soup out of this world,my lady had steak sandwich also good,her bloddy mary awesome she said,my draft beer ice cold,waiter on the ball,we will go here again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in town. Now that I've moved out of town I know it will be one of my go to places when I visit friends.   The sliders are great. I always go for the California Turkey Slide because of the avocado, bacon and roasted red pepper. Add Sweet potato fries and you've got a winner.   Most people get the SSS which is a combination of 3 of the following: soup, salad, slider, side.  The cheese curds here are good according to friends. I think they have a good beer selection too. Great for groups and one-on-one time. Excellent service.  Tip: they always have tomato soup and chili. Ask for their soup of the day. There's always something different!"}
{"text":"Normally I am not one for ordering salads at restaurants but I really enjoy the salads here! My favorite is their salmon salad. I really enjoy their sliders and the pisco sour drinks here as well. The waiters and waitresses here are very friendly."}
{"text":"The note I left to myself after the first time I went here was: Sliders and weird salads- melted cheese.  To you all, that should mean \"They are known for sliders.  My salad was slathered in melted cheese, which I found odd.\"  I'm not a midwesterner, so pardon my ignorance, but is this a thing?  The good thing is that a slider and a salad is a reasonable lunch.  This is also a good place to take vegetarians because they will substitute a MorningStar veggie burger on any of their sliders.  It may not be a good place for a vegan.  People I would take here:  my BFs parents, who like simple, safe food that looks familiar and is served in an establishment that seems clean.  Road weary visitors who want to walk, eat, sleep, return to road.  Westward, ho!"}
{"text":"The selection of food here was fantastic. The drink menu was also enormous; I felt as if I could go there repeatedly and never tire of the options.   Also, the service was wonderful. We had a really large group with a set of complicated payment divisions and they handled it with remarkable patience!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for Whiskey Wednesdays. Every week they pick a category of whiskey to be half-off. They have a great selection and usually some off-menu specials. They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste. This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.  They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \"Brewsdays\" with some nice beer specials.  Seven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).  My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.  And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table."}
{"text":"I ate there once last week the lady said oh we have a speacial im like ok she came back with the recipt it said 50 dollars im like wtf...was the Speacial....it taste it good steack potatoes but shit....aint nothing speacial...."}
{"text":"I am from Champaign, raised there until the age of 20, when I escaped to Austin. I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends, and when I do, Seven Saints is a must-hit place for food. And I get the same thing every single time.  The Triple S Combo Platter. One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup.   This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess.   There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special.   I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place.  Salads are fantastic.  Mostly a slider/salad/sandwich place.    Excellent decor.  Staff is grand.  Always great!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato chips with goat cheese cream sauce are a-MAZ-ing. This appetizer is certainly big enough to share with 1-3 other people, depending on how much other food you order. Or you could eat half yourself and take the other half home for lunch the next day. Not that I know anyone who has ever done that..."}
{"text":"Recently went back to Champaign (where I went to grad school) for a wedding and got to hit all my old spots.  Seven Saints, per usual, did not disappoint.  Cheese curds aren't as good as they once were, but still a hit.  I always get the Triple S combo, with a salad, soup, and slider.  Black and blue salad remains one of my favorites.  Had a bad beer, but the waitress was awesome and took it off the bill, so no deductions on stars there.  If you're in town for any reason, make sure to swing by."}
{"text":"Service is ok to good. But the food is very good! I can't think of one bad thing here.  Sliders - Goood. Salads - Gooood.  Soups - Goooood.  (haven't had any of the sandwiches).  I recommend the combo so you get to try a few things. Favorite appetizer is the pretzels, then sweet chips, then cheese curds.  Hummus is pretty good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I came here for Whiskey Wednesday, which is 50% off select whiskey flavors. If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!  The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.  Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.  I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.  Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Soooo ordered a half salad half sandwich Meal for $10.00 and my sandwich \"club sandwich\" was literally two pieces of lunch meat (do not ever order! Sooooo not worth the money) And the salad was ok but the chicken was wayyy over cooked and cold and dried out. Yuck. On a better note the cheese curds are AWESOME! Just never order the club. Rip off."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite bars or food places in Champaign. It's super relaxed and welcoming, and the waiters are super nice (not to mention good looking.) Always very prompt service, clean interior and bathrooms and great food.  The friend cheese curds are something I crave far too often. They come with a great marinara sauce and are super hot and chewy. My mouth waters just thinking about them.  The fish tacos and crab cakes are also delicious. Fish tacos are my budget friendly go to. Super filling and delicious.   Their soups, especially the tomato bisque are to die for as well. So flavorful.   The sliders are great too, my favorite is the salmon, but I would definitely try all of them including the buffalo chicken slider.  Whisky selection as others have said is crazy good. Definitely a must visit."}
{"text":"Place was slammed when I first came by so I went to a couple other places first.  Then found my way back to Seven Saints. The beer was cold and the sliders awesome. I had the  brautwerst slider and it was way different than I expected. It was great. The bartender 055 (they only have a number. No name on their tag) was great and easy to engage conversation with.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Champaign. Great service, excellent food. Cheese curds!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place when I'm in the mood for half a sandwich and salad. I normally get their Portobello sandwich or grilled cheese with the goat cheese salad. Their white chili is great when they have it. Also, I love their specials. Their drink lists are pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar is conveniently located in downtown Champaign. We sat down around 6PM on a Sunday Night for dinner.  Appetizer: Get the half order of pretzels. I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.  Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.  Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.  Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.  I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++"}
{"text":"Been years since I have been here..  Finally headed back and wasn't impressed with the fact their entire menu is fried.  Well with the exception of the hummus and sliders.  They got rid of their cheese curds.  :(  Their Manhattans are good though...  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It seems like a Guido's wannabe meaning.. the decor is nice and could be posh.  Not so many people frequent there unfortunately.  So it's not a trendy place as of now.  It's an okay place.. I don't really like any of their specialty drinks.  I tried the Jamiebull (not enough Redbull or Jameson) and the Lemon Shakeup (too sweet).  I have tried their sliders (which is like a mini burger).. they are decent but they aren't terribly big and kind of pricey if you get three of them (which is equivalent to one burger).  I haven't had any outstanding salads here either unfortunately.  I would try it if you want a change in scenery from Guido's and Boltini's."}
{"text":"I think this place is great; the drink selection is substantial, the food is very unique and very good, the service is on point, the atmosphere is a bit noisy but easy to deal with and the prices are comparable to other pubs in the area. Overall, a great place to come to for good food and great beer, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, so it's kind of sad that they don't have better service....   My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something.   The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy.   I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance. There is also an extensive beer list, but none of that really matters if your service is that bad..."}
{"text":"Friends dragged me back here and I was hesitant but the service was a COMPLETE 180 from my horrible birthday dinner. Our server (Molly? short curly hair..) was probably one of the best server's I've ever had. Great menu suggestions, friendly personality, food came to the table hot, and she made sure to take care of all the little things (extra napkins, dessert being offered). Because of her I definitely will be back. Seems like the first bad experience was just the server, not the establishment."}
{"text":"Upscale bar experience. Food is more refined compared to places like their neighbor, Esquire. The sliders are tasty, and I have not been disappointed with anything I've ordered (soup, salad, appetizers). Its true that Seven Saints is more expensive than a dive bar, but its not a dive bar, so the prices make sense.   Service varies. Sometimes its great, other times not so much. However, it hasn't been bad enough to prevent me from returning.   Great downtown spot."}
{"text":"Great late not spot or really anytime of the day. The food is cheap and delicious, and the service is pretty good as well. Pretty busy on the weekends but the wait is not anything crazy. Overall one of the best restaurants in champaign."}
{"text":"Another solid choice for lunch and dinner casual dining. I'm usually here for business lunches but it's also served well to grab a late meal. It has a quintessential American pub menu. I like the California turkey and the little tacos. Food is moderately priced and done right. Just another great little place on the downtown Champaign scene."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their little slider, soup, and sweet potato fries meal. I had their cheddar broccoli soup and it was very tasty. Also had their Blackjack Jalepeno Slider. Very good! Not atmosphere and decor. Our visits were not very frequent so that was a struggle when we needed something but otherwise it was great. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunches with people from work, and generally we have had good experiences.  The food is pretty good quality, but the prices are just slightly above where they should be (in my opinion) since most of the items I've tried have been sliders.   My favorites are the Black Jack slider (pepperjack cheese, grilled onions and ancho aioli topped with fried jalapeños) and the Smokey BBQ slider (cheddar, bbq sauce, fried onion ring).  Good stuff.   The lunch combos are a pretty good deal, which offsets the price issue I mentioned earlier.  I usually get the slider + side + salad combo for lunch (which is about $10), and they have other combinations for that.  I've only had the Caesar salad, and it was fine.  Several of my co-workers have had the salmon slider and said it was good as well.  I have tried the crinkle-cut sweet potato fries, which were good but not my personal favorite.  The cheese curds are great (as many others have posted), but you do feel a bit of guilt for eating batter-covered balls of cheese.  It's nearly the epitome of gluttony, and you can feel your arteries harden mid-bite.  We did order the Bavarian Pretzels once also and those were good.  Service is usually average, at best, but not worth complaining about much.  If it's cold outside, avoid the table near the door!   We went once in February when it was still pretty cold out, and even with a large curtain around the entrance way, we were constantly blasted by cold air when people came in the door.  Even in warm weather it's rather distracting.  We've been seated there twice (maybe it's their only pre-setup table for 8).  I'd recommend asking to sit somewhere away from the door if possible.  We'll probably go back.  They have enough variety that it's a nice place to go occasionally."}
{"text":"(?^?)? Such a letdown. I'm not sure if I set expectations too high or I just went in on an off day, but this place was not as dazzlingly amazing as I thought it would be.  Waiting for a server was to come greet us took 15 minutes and getting the food had about a 30 minute wait. When it finally arrived, the food was missing about 1/4 of its supposed components listed on the menu, which sucked. I couldn't even attempt to take an appealing picture of the food (sliders) as it looked so bare and sad.  Seven Saints is quite overhyped and has mediocre food, but despite that I can't deny that they had good staff."}
{"text":"Amazing atmospheres casual dining and excellent food. If you come to Champaign stop here. Great food across the board and unbelievable liquor selection. Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best place downtown! Salmon slider is to do die for. Love the tuna salad platter as well. Never had an appetizer I didn't like from there. Best desserts in town! Love that drunken pie! Yum"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few co workers and we saw the Yelp reviews so we decided to check it out. Beer selection was pretty decent, the main attraction here are the sliders. I will say, I had the tomato bisque soup to start and it was VERY good. I also followed up with the California slider and the turkey bacon slider. Both were OK, next time I will just stick with the beef sliders."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here since I moved to Illinois since I have heard a lot of good things about it.  Finally my co-workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat, so I was more than happy to tag along.    We went around 12 noon, on a weekday.  The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated.  It's almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains.  We had a large group of 10, and fortunately we were able to get a table.  The place itself seems very large, as there were from what I could tell, 3 distinct areas to sit in, and an outside dining area as well.  All and all though, the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done.   Granted the restaurant was pretty busy, it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order, and another 15 to just get our drinks (and most of us just had water).  The food did not take too long to come out, but once again I wasn't impressed at all.  I got the club sandwich with waffle fries, and I can't say it was bad at all, but there was just not a thing special about it.  It's your typical greasy fare typee of place too... Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc.    I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is)  All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special.    I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally.  I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food.  Just a very average joint."}
{"text":"Been here once - its located in Downtown Champaign. The burgers are really good and my friend recommended me the tomato soup, which was good too!"}
{"text":"Seven Saints is, hands down, my favorite place to go in Champaign. It has the perfect atmosphere to enjoy a night, with great food (esp. the buffalo chicken sliders and cheese curds!), an amazing spirits list with tons of awesome and very very affordably priced, whiskies, and a relaxed, comfortable feel. Andy is an exceptional general manager who takes clear interest in creating a positive personal experience for the customers, and the service is exceptional. That's not even to mention the AMAZING 50% off whiskeys every Wednesday night :) I can't say enough about how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Ah, ye olde back-to-school move in day when the whole fam comes down to help me move in.  Saturday night, we waited about 30 minutes, which after walking around wasn't that bad.  We got seated in the far room, which I didn't even know existed until we ended up at a table/booth spot around the corner.  The décor of Seven Saints is really cool. It's dark: too dark for any food picture. Feels old/vintage on the inside and has a very cool atmosphere.  We started with the Bavarian pretzels and a black & blue salad. The pretzels were really warm and tasty, the salad was also wasn't bad, although kind of skimpy on the ribeye pieces.   We each got one of the \"pick X, Y, and Z\" combos. I got an Asian slider with the chicken enchilada soup, and sweet potato fries. It was pretty good, the slider was small, as expected, not quite White Castle size or anything though. I really enjoyed the wasabi flavor of the slaw, but felt it needed more toppings. I did order it with everything on a typical burger (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) since the top of the menu said those items were available at your request, but I didn't get any of those items when my food was brought out. I did try my Dad's California turkey slider and thought that was pretty good, too. The soup wasn't bad, although it more resembled a chili in my opinion. Crinkle-cut sweet potato fries were awesome!   Seven Saints has an extensive selection of alcohol. I really think they are a bar more so than a restaurant. Lots of exotic, small-batch, local, craft, etc. type liquors, cocktails and beers. I had something called a Dragon's Milk, which was an absolutely delicious stout but pricey at $7.50  I forgot our server's name but she did a good job!  Overall a little pricey for what it is, but I felt the food was definitely a step up from typical bar/pub food. In my opinion, they should diversify their menu by way of adding some non-sandwich options. I must note that they source most of their meet from Old Time Meat & Deli down the street, which is great, knowing things are a bit more local.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is another bar/restaurant in downtown Champaign. They are going for a more upscale look than say the Blind Pig or Mike 'n Molly's. Everything is very clean, and spotless. There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.  The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?  The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy.  The salad was a bit slimy as well.  The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.  Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited).  That rotates a bit, so the selection does change.  The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).  Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt."}
{"text":"I go here pretty frequently. This is my favorite birthday joint. There food is just amazing. Cheese curds, you'll never find them like here, anywhere else. Sweet chips. Omfggggg. Okay and the fruit and goat cheese salad. It's just off the charts.   I love everything about this place. Minus a few waiters. One in particular basically gave us flat soda, when we alerted him of it his response was \"I was hoping you guys wouldn't notice, they're in the middle of changing it. I guess I'll just bring you guys some fresh ones when they're actually done.\" SERIOUSLY?!?! I was appalled. Any ways, the host switched us immediately to a new servers section and understood completely when we asked to move.   Other than that interaction I haven't had a negative experience. Can't beat the quality!"}
{"text":"I've been a couple times, and on my most recent trip was pretty darn satisfied. Yes, there are finer restaurants in CU, yes there are cheaper bars, and yes there are better crowds, however I sure enjoyed the hell out of my last trip.   Here's why: they have an excellent liquor selection with a focus on Irish, Scotch, and Bourbon Whiskies. Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full.   If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy. Also, on Wednesdays, they have HALF price on all their whisky/ey!  The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling (some would even say intoxicating) beverage."}
{"text":"Tried out a slider and wasn't very impressed. However, I will say that the tomato bisque is simply delectable and should definitely be tried. What I found odd was that the waiters have numbers as name tags instead of their actual names... Are these waiters nothing but numbers to this establishment? Haha, I hope not."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. Nice staff, cool decor.  I ordered the goat cheese salad (spring greens, grapes, strawberries, goat cheese, sweet roasted walnuts, and fruity vinaigrette) and a salmon slider. The food was decent... Loved the salad, but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn't work for me. However, they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for $0.50 extra so I might try that next time.  What I really like about this place is the strong drinks! Two drinks and I had a nice buzz, and I'm normally not a two-drink lady. The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey, but I ordered a Tom Collins (not on the menu) and it was $3.50, which is pretty good in my book."}
{"text":"Sliders are served VERY well done (bordering on burnt) -- despite the fact that I ordered them medium rare.  This is the second time I've tried their sliders and they've come out this way.  With that said, they have a great beer selection,  but I won't be going back for the food."}
{"text":"In town for Memorial Day weekend. Went here on the first night we got in (Friday). We were looking for someplace low-key and casual after several hours in the car, and this place fit the bill very nicely. Service was excellent, (Mustafa!) and the food was very high quality and a good value. My wife had a couple of the Black Jack sliders, and I went with the 7 Saints salad. We both definitely enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Wonderful whiskey selection.  We go here pretty frequently for whiskey Wednesdays.  Looks nice and well kept.  The weird \"don't walk through the kitchen\" part when trying to get to the seating area is a major pain.  You'll see what I mean.  That area alone makes it incredibly hard to move around during busy times without slamming into a server."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars, not because of its products or service, but because of its prices. I live in the east coast and have been to plenty of nice places that are much better and charge about the same for drinks and food - but this is not NYC or Philly, so come on! I have also been to many places in the Savoy/Champaign/Urbana area and there are other installments, as nice as this one, that charge a more reasonable fee for drinks. Other than that, I like the staff and the food, specially the sliders and a steak salad they have. It would be nice if they had a live band once a week."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Simply good. I really love the Half salad and a slider deal."}
{"text":"I'm going with 4 stars because the Caesar salad needs some work and I feel the menu selection is a little light. Other than that, they have a great beer selection, the cheese plate is absolutely delicious (whatever they do to the bread to soften it up is a masterpiece of appetizer prep, plus each type of cheese on the plate is very tasty) and they play some damn good music. On a Saturday night on the outdoor patio I heard them play The Avalanches, Rob Dougan, Gorillaz, Lindsey Stirling and many more amazing artists that just happen to be in my favorite genre. I don't know if it was a streaming service or a custom playlist but they should continue with it. The wait staff are cute, and they do a good job. I really like Seven Saints."}
{"text":"Very nice option for nicer 'bar food' in the C-U area. Great place to go for lunch or a casual dinner. The food is solid and the service was great."}
{"text":"Most people come here for the sliders, but I'm going to tell you about a little known gem on their menu: the ribeye steak sandwich.  This. Sandwich.  Agh. It's just.. it's so good. I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.  I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.  Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. They even have ginger ale on tap, YES! Anytime I've been less than 100% satisfied, the staff has been completely accommodating and has removed any problem item from the bill, AFTER replacing it for me. I couldn't have better things to say about this establishment!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pretzel appetizer, bisque also good. I usually get the grilled cheese and the beer selection pretty decent, wish i would have asked what else they had on tap before i ordered off the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of seven Saints. It is hard to find a downtown bar that doesn't annoy the crap out of you or is a place for drunk parents to come visit during the weekend. But this place is a sanctuary for the rest of us who just like to drink whiskey and eat tiny burgers with our friends. I highly suggest the salmon sliders although at $4 a pop they are pretty costly. I pretty much only come on whiskey Wednesdays so I can sample the best that they have. The waiters are always really helpful and will suggest whiskey for you to try even if you're not used to drinking them. Seating can be limited depending on what time you come but if you can grab a table outside during the cooler nights of summer, you'll never find a better place. It is on university so it can be a bit noisy due to traffic."}
{"text":"I've only ever sat at the bar, so I can't speak about the dining room experience. But I'm always happy when I leave. They make good drinks, have some decent sandwiches (some are better than others) and very respectable fried cheese curds. Bartenders are always friendly."}
{"text":"The sliders options are insane, from turkey, salmon or beef patties with some killer combo condiments. Place is trendy, you can have the option to sit outside though I'm from FL so I get hot weather 365, service was quick and good beer selections. The cheese curls are a most, don't miss those..."}
{"text":"I came here on 3 separate occasions in a span of two days...of course I love it! Their main dishes are sliders, sandwiches, and salads. Sliders are about $3-4 for three of them. However, getting their combos are the most worth it! I always got the slider, salad, and side combo...and its just 10 bucks!!! Its so worth it considering a single salad is already around 7-10 bucks.  BBQ slider, Country fried chicken salad, sweet potato fries: I loved the BBQ slider!! It comes slathered in BBQ sauce and an onion ring inside! So delicious... The salad also had great texture with the crispiness of the chicken. Plus it comes with bacon so the flavor was all there! Their sweet potato fries are one of the best I've ever had.. It was crispy, seasoned perfectly, and you could still taste the sweetness of it all! Loved how its crinkled too.  Black Jack slider, Salmon salad: The black jack slider comes with my favorite pepperjack cheese and some fried jalapeños! Still liked the bbq slider more chuz of that bbq sauce. The salmon salad was alright. I found myself just picking out the salmon and eating only that. Still a solid salad though!  With the amount/variety of food you get, you seriously get band for your buck! Plus, Tuesdays is half off draft beers..meaning we only paid 2-3 bucks for a beer...seriously what?!?! (I recommend Dead Guy!) Wednesdays is also half off whiskey...man such deals! The service was great, always attentive and friendly! They play great music here so its a chill place to grab a drink. Also, they have awesome Halloween/Harry Potter decorations right now! My inner nerd squealed when I saw their Slytherin sign hanging hehe.  I wish I lived near here! Awesome food, awesome drinks, all at a reasonable price..what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Urbana has a lot of surprises for someone who enjoys nice drinks with great food. This was one of them. They have a great selection of spirits, wine, cocktails and great food.  Will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks back with some co-workers for a going away lunch. I decided to order a few sliders. I wish they had a \"slider flight\" option where you get a deal for 3 sliders or something. The service was prompt and friendly even with our large group. The sliders were.....okay......the bread was kind of mushy and not impressive. The garnishes were more like the quality you'd see at Subway and the beef reminded me of Wendy's or White Castle. Is it the shape, dense texture, or just general tastelessness? I can't quite put my finger on it but it's just not impressive considering its their \"specialty\". The prices are okay but considering that you could probably get better burgers at a fast food restaurant, I feel like they could be cheaper but I guess you're paying for the ambiance and service. Personally, I don't need ambiance, I go out to enjoy unique, high quality food. Ideally, rather than cheaper prices, I think just higher quality food would make more sense. On the plus side, I could see this place being good for picky eaters who are repelled by too many flavors in their food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Seven Saints has a very impressive whiskey and drink selection; though I was unfortunately at that point in the night where I couldn't enjoy another drink, I'd definitely come back to the bar. Food is on the slightly pricier end (especially sliders, they're about $4 each) but if you opt for a sandwich they're more reasonable and very tasty after a night out. My capicola ham sandwich was nicely toasted in butter which made it all the more warm and satisfying. I also dig the atmosphere of this place; it has a classier ambience which is harder to find in a college town."}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual lunch or dinner everything on the menu I have tried has been excellent wide variety for anybody vegetarian or not."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Seven Saints and I've come back a few times. It has a nice selection of beer, but not the best in town.  What draws me back are the sliders, the 7 Saints Salad and the waffle fries.   My first time here I had the 7 Sinners Crowd Pleaser and it was just as sinfully good as described. Especially the beer battered cheese curds that you've read many reviews praising. However, I cannot incorporate it in every meal as it is rather lot of food.  So my usual go to is the 7 saints salad which has a lemony-peanut dressing that I just cannot forget. It is especially good during lunch when they serve it half size.  I feel really good about myself after eating it, because I get my veggies and protein (yummy sirloin).  I would generally split this with someone and add a few sliders. You can always substitute the beef patty with chicken or turkey (or boca). The California is one that I enjoy. Personally don't like the Chicago Dog, which should remain a dog. Lastly I finish with the waffle fries! Oh just delicious. Well seasoned!"}
{"text":"If I lived close by I would eat here every week! The menu is unique with many options. The opportunity to try so many sliders at a decent price is ideal. We had the \"sweet chips appetizer\", get it, it's amazing! We also had the California turkey slider (the sauce really made this one)! And the Asian slider, which could be a tad bit more \"Asiany\", but still great. The Sweet Potato Fries are perfection, finally someone who does it right, crinkle cut and crispy!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not great. However, the tomato bisque soup is available daily, and it is absolutely fabulous."}
{"text":"Been here twice,  once on a date and once with friends. For the date we sat at the bar where we ordered drinks and split an appetizer. I was surprised with how late the kitchin since it must have been past 10pm. We ordered chicken fingers which were really filling and came with 2 sauces. Their drink menu is huge and they have lots of cocktail options.  The staff is friendly, attentive and on top of their game.  The bartender suggested drinks that he created which was really good! My boyfriend loved the ability to get aged Wiskey and has been excited about it since.   Today I went back with some friends for a late lunch and was surprised by the amount of menu items! They all looked really good and offer tons of customization.  Ended up settling on a ribeye steak sandwich.  Paired with the sweet potato fries it's perfection. Too much food for just me but I took it home to save for dinner.    The décoré is nice,  and the prices are good,  but the staff is excellent! I'm definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their food. Definitely give their sliders a try. The service can be a little slow at times, but I can deal with that. I always enjoy their themed days, especially Whiskey Wednesday. Also, if you're ever interested, give the absinthe a try. If the owner is there, he will give you the whole presentation and history, which is just as amazing as the drink!"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this joint 3.5 stars, but I'll make do with 4 since it was a great weekend.    Pros: 1.  Good beer list.  Left Hand Milk Stout for $4.50?  This Chicago girl says yes, please.   2.  Tasty food.  I had the slider/salad/sweet potato fries combo, and everything was really good.  They're known for their sliders, apparently. 3.  Great vibe.  We didn't feel rushed here.  Didn't feel pressured to drink more, and they didn't blink when our party size doubled and we moved to a different table.    Cons: 1.  Small-ish portions:  At $10 for the above-mentioned meal, I felt a little.....unsatisfied.  The sliders seem pricey at  $3+ a pop, too.   2.  Service:  A bit slow.  It picked up when we started strictly drinking, but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal.    All in all, I'd head back.  It's a nice joint in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Great salads.  I do wish they had more vegan prepared options, rather than having to ask to make a salad with a bunch of different vegetables or make up some sort of of vegan slider.  Otherwise, great food and ambiance.  Love their hummus platter."}
{"text":"They were fast, the food was delicious, and the service was great. What more could you ask for? There were 7 of us and we got a table immediately. There was no wait. Also, they're dog friendly. They even brought out a bowl for the dog. The appetizers are delicious! We got the 7 sinners appetizer platter. It was a delicious variety and only took about 10 minutes to come out. After that we had all bought different sliders. They were small, but that was expected because they're only sliders. I suggest getting the Hot Dog one it was something different to try, but delicious. Overall I would suggest anyone in the area to give it a try! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice selection of Bourbon.  Need more of a draft selection.  Tasty sliders, great atmosphere and solid service...makes for a great visit."}
{"text":"GREAT SLIDERS  Picked this place from all the great reviews at Yelp and that was a great choice.   The entire staff is very welcoming and friendly and are really trained on how to provide great customer service. The place looks great and elegant good for a quick lunch just as well for a nice romantic dinner.  They are known for their sliders and their salads and offer a variety of combos that allow you to mix and match their gear salads with delicious sliders.   We got things started with an order of sweet potato fries served with a goat cream cheese for dipping and it was delicious by combining sweet and salty tastes.  We ordered three different combos and all three were winners:  California Turkey & avocado slider Honey Dijon Chicken slider Tropical Stack slider Asian slider Black Jack slider (this one is spicy)  Asian salad (nice and sweet) Seven Saints salad (nice and spicy)  We had no room left for dessert even tough they appeared to have some neat offerings... Next time!"}
{"text":"I really hate being up-charged for things that aren't explicitly stated when ordered.  For instance, I ordered a side of sweet potato fries.  Fries come out.  We get asked if we want some goat cheese cream to go with it.  The bf says, \"sure.\"  It comes out when we have two fries left for an extra $1.50.  I don't even like goat cheese!  Same goes for their pretzel.  They give a tiny portion of jalapeño cheese and some mustard.  We didn't like the mustard, so we asked for a little more cheese...that was an extra $0.50.  The money isn't a big deal, but it is annoying to find these little charges on the final bill when we were gonna just tip more anyways.  After several dinners here, it just seems like a customer service isn't a huge priority."}
{"text":"Andy B: Do you know what we call women who like whiskey? Female Customer next to her man: No what? Andy: Keepers  Wednesday is Whiskey Wednesday. While Wednesday is the greatest night for drinking in downtown Champaign, what with half price drafts at Jupiter's, $1 off all 27 taps at Radio Maria, Blind Pig Brewery Mug Club, various specials at many other bars... one of the best deals is Whiskey Wednesday at Seven Saints IS one of the best reasons to go downtown. It's half price whiskey based on that weeks theme. Last night was Irish and International. You can remember the theme based on MIBS. M=micro American and Canadian. I = Irish and international. B=Bourbon. S=Scotch.  If you want to try something new, if you want to try something expensive that you won't get anywhere else... go to whiskey Wednesday.  Last night during I night, got a serving of the Jameson Rare. Normally $40, last night only $20. Shared with a friend, so my part was only $10. I can live with that.  Started out with the special international whiskey. I have no idea what it was, but it was something I'd never heard of. The amazing Figgy was our server. He explained it to us several times, but still, I have no idea what all he said. Something about sherry, something about oak, something about bourbon. It sounded good. We got it. It was a very interesting whiskey (if it was whiskey). There were many, many, many things going on in it. There was sherry, there was oak, there was bourbon-y flavors. There was, sadly, too many things going on for me to fully LIKE it. I can appreciate it, but LIKE it is something else.  It's actually Seven Saints fault that I even like whiskey at all! One night, a long time ago, kridz and I and several others (who pretty much all worked at saints) went up to The Stube in Gibson City. Kridz and I rode back with those crazy mooney boys, and we had them in to have a drink at the end. I busted out a bottle of Mikkeller Black, aged in bourbon barrels. I was pretty good with beer, but couldn't drink any whiskey. A couple of years before that, I was at a Crane Alley beer class (taught by the above Andy B) and he did bourbon one night. Skot, Paddy, and I were there. The first whiskey tasted like burning, the second tasted like fire, the third tasted like my mouth was numb... it's like that online story of the guy who had to do the Texas Chilli tasting thing... Paddy got all of Skot and my whiskey that night. Skot and I were sober, paddy was drunj. So, I'm drinking the Mikkeller Black with the Mooney's and I'm like what's that vanilla flavor in there, and the boys are like \"that's the bourbon\", and i'm like whaaaaaaa???? So the next week we went into Saints on bourbon Wednesday and I get something, and for the first time ever, It didn't taste like fire, it tasted like vanilla, with oak, with a little bit of syrup, and maybe some cotton candy. And that was a very expensive night.  I like the sliders, I once got 3 sliders but instead of being served on a bun, they were served on a tortilla.  I've never had a bad time here. I know people who say they have, and i'm not sure why they had a bad time. Sometimes it's busy. Sometimes the place is full. I'm friends with everyone (everywhere) so, I understand when I don't get the most attentive service. If the service may not be as personal as you might hope to get on a busy Friday or Saturday, don't go on a Friday or Saturday (Wednesday can be very busy as well). Go on a quiet evening (like sunday) sit at the bar, and ask questions. The staff here is some of the most educated on their products as you will find in a bar (period). They know what they are selling. If you have a question, they will answer it. If you ask them what they like (on a particular Wednesday) they will tell you what their favorite is, and they won't be mad about it (like I get when people ask me what my favorite is).  The Monday night steak special is darn good too.  The cheese curds are huge (yes, it's a lot of breading, but so what). Once, Andy put together a cheese curd/onion ring/chilli/cheese/diced onions/everything else fried plate that was super delicious. Like a deep fried casserole, with chilli. It's not on the menu, and don't try to get it when it's super busy."}
{"text":"I've come here a lot! It's great for whiskey Wednesdays (where they have half priced whiskeys on some selections) and they have delicious salmon sliders! Try themmmm. Along with their sweet potato fries and they're summer salmon salad and you got yourself a yummy meal. They have had great service the times I've gone and I've enjoyed almost all things I've ordered. I always just go for the salmon because the flavor is so tender and delicious! Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place with bartenders who can actually hold a conversation! They know their beer and are happy to introduce some local favorites as well. The menu isn't diverse but the quality is good and portions are not over sized. Recommend the sausage -kale soup to start and a nice selection of sliders to round out the meal"}
{"text":"Love their little burgers! So cute and tasty. I like the salmon one. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place for a number of reasons. First of all, the restaurant looks like a castle on the inside, it's very nicely decorated with a romantic \"regal\" feel in my opinion. Second, the food and drinks are fairly priced, we were surprised by our check since we had ordered drinks.. in a good way! Thirdly, and most importantly, the food is excellent! I always get the salmon slider without fail, the mixture of salmon, sauce ,and cucumber is perfect. Highly recommend it and the ribeye sandwich!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds.  I don't have to say anything more. The food is great!  Love the sliders The drinks are also great!  They have a HUGE menu and an even larger selection of booze to choose from.  Always happy to eat here."}
{"text":"Great find in bustling Champaign! Had a fantastic experience at Seven Saints and after reading many positives reviews, I walked in holding them to a high standard, which our awesome server, Otto, totally exceeded. You enter and immediately are welcomed into an atmosphere filled with dark wood accents and velvet patterned curtains that set the mood. It was fairly busy for being after the dinner rush, but still had a cozy vibe.   We were open to trying anything so Otto made some great suggestions that hit the spot. Our favorites were the cheese curds, which were gone in two minutes, and the sliders. Tons of different choices and with a mix-and-match option for doing soup/salad/slider, you've got plenty of options! For sauces, try the honey mustard. It was by far the best ever.   With a close location to the campus (about a ten-minute drive), we will definitely be back to Seven Saints!"}
{"text":"Spent some great times at Seven Saints over the years at U of I and then back and forth from   Chicago.   SS would fit in nicely in a Chicago neighborhood -- and that's a real compliment.  Great beers, nice wines, and terrific sandwiches, including the Portobello.  Knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff and a terrific bar.   Miss you!"}
{"text":"I go here almost every time I visit Champaign. Amazing drink selection, and the food is absolutely to die for. I always completely pig out because there is just so much good stuff on the menu. One of my favorite places in the area."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I was introduced to Tri Tip sirloin...  It had been a long day surfing when we stumbled upon a beach party in San Diego where some fellow beach bums were grilling some meat low and slow, it was perfectly peppery and delicious.  Next time I had it was in the Signature Salad at Seven Saints.  I had thought for some time that this was the best salad I had ever tasted, until I tried the Summer Salmon salad also from Seven Saints and now I stand at ends forever confused about which I like better."}
{"text":"I think I need to change it up because everytime I come here I order the summer salmon salad & crab cakes! Ask for extra avocado & dressing, so delicious! Crab cakes are very tasty as well! Service is excellent. Sometimes I'll get it to-go, no issues with that."}
{"text":"I have a couple friends that work here and they say they like it. I came into visit shortly after it opened and it's never been overly packed (except the outdoor seating is always full), which is nice. I'd say it's more for an older crowd or at least a more relaxed one. The variety of beer and wine is awesome. I thought the sliders there were delicious, same with the soups and salads. Of all of the bars downtown, this one definitely has the best food.  The actual atmosphere on the other hand is really nice. There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints. It's all pretty cute and makes a nice place to have an outside dinner. I'd recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Meh. Looking for fried food?  Go here. Get the pretzel, its good.  The drinks are okay. The salmon dill slider?  I ate the salmon and left the rest. Classic is on point though.  Staff was attentive which is refreshing. What can I say I like when people treat me well."}
{"text":"Went in late night for a beer on a weeknight. Heard it is a popular spot on the weekends."}
{"text":"We shared a variety of sliders:  Asian,  Smoky BBQ, Black Jack, Tropical Stack, and Buffalo Chicken.  My favorite was the Asian. My husband's was the Buffalo Chicken.  Bloody Mary was good too!  And our waitress, Katrina, was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I keep hearing raves about this place, but in all the years I've occasionally visited I've never been blown away. The sliders are essentially mini burgers that taste exactly like ingredients described on the menu, put together as a burger. The prices are not wallet friendly given the casual sound of sliders.  Perhaps the drinks here are what's being hyped, or the drinks are enhancing the taste of the food, but I've never been impressed. Lively atmosphere, many large groups of friends."}
