{"text":"When we walked in the place had a funny smell, but forgave and ordered food anyway.  The building is not very well kept, it had rained and they had buckets catching water where the roof was leaking.

I ordered the #15, which was a bean tostada taco and 2 rolled taco.  The price was great, just under $5 for all that food.  However, it was not even worth the $5 I paid.  The other people I was with got their food first and thought it smelled a little off (the got rolled tacos).  I got my food and it had the same weird smell to it.  I gave it a try and tasted a rolled taco.  It had no flavor except the bad after taste.  The food may have been going bad, at least it smelled that way. Ended up throwing it away!  I will not be returning.  Do yourself a favor, go to one of the many other Mexican food places and save yourself the disappointment."}

{"text":"Our favorite late weekend night munchies go to place. Service is great and menudo is the best! I wish the menu wasn't so crowded thigh as its overwhelming trying to order and they need to fix the drive thru speaker in the back."}
{"text":"Tasted like yesterday's meat. And the cheese tasted moldy. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The red and green chile sauce for the burrito were full of hair. I guess they are giving the white people a Trump special. And yes I know the difference between pubic hair and the strands from the chile's."}
{"text":"Good food, but they definitelyy over-charged me! They didn't even give me the exact order i wanted, but i was here to celebrate and meet with friends, so it wasn't that big of a deal. And good thing i don't live anywhere near this place, so it's safe to say i won't be coming here again. I gotta stick with my favorites: humbertos or filibertos. :)"}
{"text":"Que paso Homey?! I come for vacation frm Chicago and thought 'mannn the Mexican food is gona be gooood  being so close to the MothaLand!' But noOoO!  Wow- this was my first impression of Mexican food here- and it was HORRIBLE! I had asada tacos and one chicken taco- they had a literal dab of guacamole and they used cheddar cheese!! Who does that?? What happened to queso Ranceherito or queso fresco?! I will give Phoenix one more chance at Mexican food and then I'm RUNNINNNG back to La Villita where Lil Mexico does it legit!"}
