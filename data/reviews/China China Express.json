{"text":"Really cheap food and really nice family that owns the place. The food itself isn't the greatest Chinese food I've had; but it's far from bad and you won't regret picking it up. Honestly, you get a full container for around five bucks so if you're hungry and looking for take out to fill you quickly, try it out. The fried shrimp is always good to me. And I'd order the rice over the noodles. It's cheap, satisfying and won't turn your stomach."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood favorite. Kind of place where they know your name and favourite dish. Has slipped slightly over the years but still better than the others. Canadianized chinese food."}
{"text":"Very bad!it's not the real Chinese cuisine. just garbage food. i order a sweet sour shrimp it was like four fried flour ball with tiny shrimp. and the sauce was too much artificial red color and sugar. never never go and recommend it. Better to cook by myself."}
{"text":"Very good prices, fast and friendly service.   The family that owns this restaurant is extremely nice. Food could be better but it still is a bargain for the price. Would definitely recommend it if looking for something fast and cheap to eat."}
{"text":"My sister and I accidentally ordered from this place using the Just Eat app. We meant to order from China Gourmet on York Mills.    Either way, the food wasn't bad. Arrived earlier than expected, very fresh and hot. We ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, mushroom fried rice, General Tso's chicken, honey garlic chicken, and a side of extra honey garlic sauce.   Our only complaints were that we ordered plain Lo Mein, but were given fried rice. Also, the General Tso's chicken was a bit chewy. The honey garlic chicken was delicious though the sauce is VERY sweet.   If our order was correct and the chicken wasn't chewy, I definitely would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are so small that $77 didnt buy enough food to feed 8 people. Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"It's a take out/delivery Chinese place, you know what to expect. Good, but not great food and lot's for the money.  Fantastic value on their combos, I was full after finishing... for more than an hour. Server was super friendly to everyone who came in while I was waiting, and to me as well. Good place to go to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"worst chinese food i have ever had. i.e chili beef is paper thin sliced beef covered with a thick breading. fried rice has almost no eggs. dont waste your money.  had to throw out half the order"}
{"text":"I actually saw their menu while I was staying at the Delta Toronto East on Kennedy right off the 401 and ended up ordering food to the hotel. I decided to order. The service was definitely the best thing about them. Very friendly and informative. They offer some combination specials for about $7 that are really good deals. The food came in about 30 minutes or so and I met the delivery guys in the hotel lobby. He was very nice and efficient. The food was bad to fair. I was craving good Chinese food since I got to Canada (from NYC) and decided to try them out of convenience. Spring rolls were too flavorful and only had bean sprouts inside. It seemed like the chicken dishes, the chili chicken and  general tso chicken were really mushy and soggy. The chili sauce was bitter and the general tso chicken wasn't too flavorful and just loaded with raw chili flakes. The spare rib tips were excellent but a little overdone. The safest bet of the bunch was good old chicken wings and french fries which we good, not great but good. I hope this isn't a representation of the Chinese food in Canada. I really do hate trashing nice people, because they really were nice and helpful, but the food was not good. A few days later I had to fulfill my craving and the actually got some good old Chinese from up the block on my drive home."}
{"text":"Had shanghai noodles and wings, only giving it two stars because the wings and added egg roll were okay. The noodles however were so plain and bland not even soy sauce could fix it. Everything was just very poorly seasoned overall. Won't be returning."}
