{"text":"This is probably one of my worst restaurant experiences. I ordered the food at 8.50 PM for home delivery and they never turned up even after 10.00 PM. When I oridred, they told me that they would deliver the food in 45 mins to 1 hour. When i tried calling them at 10, they were closed. Never ever order food here. The worst thing I had paid for the food but never got it."}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Hana many times, despite being disappointed with the food each time. The thing is, I've always had great service here. The waiters are friendly and the food comes out quickly. So I always go back to try something different

The food here is not good.  But it's not terrible, and can treat your occasional Thai food craving.

I've tried their sashimi, sushi, maki rolls, unagi don, green curry, massaman curry, crab angels, pad thai, drunken noodles, exotic eggplant, and their steamed chicken and vegetables with peanut sauce. Of these, I actually really like the crab angels! But, the fish quality isn't great, and their sashimi is often sliced haphazardly. Their rolls have way too much rice on them, such that the rice overpowers the flavor of the fish. The unagi don has 10% eel and 90% rice. Their Thai entrees tend to be very salty, and they use red pepper flakes for spicyness (vs Thai chili peppers). If you like spicy food, I'd ask for a level 7 spicyness or higher (I can handle mild spices, and I was happy with my level 6).

Overall, I feel that they are a bit overpriced for the quality of food, but I love their location and their service."}
{"text":"This is really more of a 3.5 kind of place food wise but the service was excellent. I got the pad thai and my friend got the drunken noodle. They were about $12 each which is a bit expensive but the portions they gave were more than enough to last two or three meals. It wasn't the best pad thai I've had but it definitely wasn't the worse.  If you're a student you get 20% off so don't forget to tell your waiter!"}
{"text":"the food wasn't as bad as I expected it to be but it was a decent sized portion for the price ($7). I went to eat with friends and our server was really rude and it seemed like she wanted us to leave."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I ordered the garlic lovers main with shrimp. It was delish!"}
{"text":"I ordered the massaman curry and was dismayed to find that it included bell peppers, which were not in the menu description. The sauce was also overly sweet and thick. The staff were very nice, though disorganized. I may go back for sushi, but I'll steer clear of the curries from now on."}
{"text":"Do not get sushi here. It is 99% rice and 1% mediocre fish. The Thai food tastes alright though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Thai Noodle Soup, which I really enjoyed. It was not extremely flavorful but I really wasn't expecting that based on the description. I ordered through GrubHub and the soup came in two containers: one for the broth/chicken/shrimp (mainly broth, a little bit of chicken, and 2 pieces of shrimp) and another for the rice noodles. This was a lot of food for $8. I also ordered the Thai Iced Tea, which was not my favorite."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious thai food, you've come to the right place. If you are looking for CHEAP delicious thai food, come during the lunch special. The only reason I'm not going to give five stars is because in general the food is pricy, but the lunch special makes it one of the best deals in Oakland! Plus, they deliver and have online ordering. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Been here 3 times now. Had the Penang curry, green curry and most recently ordered take out of almond shrimp roll, spider roll and pad Thai. All were very good. Hands down, this place has the best pad Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. 

Staff is friendly but if you go during lunch they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off and it is really unorganized. The waiters and waitresses don't have specific tables to wait on so each one will try to take your order. It's small inside too.

The bad part is that it's a bit pricey for Oakland. Especially when you can go down the street to Sushi Fuku for cheaper (maybe not as good) and acceptable sushi. At least there isn't really competition for Thai food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch with a friend about three weeks ago. It was really hot outside & we probably should have left as soon as we realized that the AC wasn't on. The front doors were wide open and crap from the street had blown in all over the floor. However, Thai food sounded like a good idea regardless and we were looking forward to trying the new place near work.

We ordered the tempura vegetables to start. They were terrible! The batter was all wrong for tempura - had lots of texture and seemed like something you'd be more likely to find on a fried mushroom at a bar. 

I ordered the pad see ew with vegetables and my friend ordered the pad thai with chicken. Our server didn't ask about spice level and it slipped our minds as well. Both dishes came with zero spice. The pad see ew looked great when it arrived. Unfortunately, it was nearly tasteless. It had a slight sweetness, but otherwise it was mostly just oily noodles with some oily veggies. The veggies were fresh and crunchy, which was nice. My friend declared her pad thai 'sticky' with chicken that at least tasted as though it was cooked all the way. 

When we asked about getting something to spice up the dishes we were told that the server would have to find it. Turns out, the one rack of spicy condiments was two tables over from us. They must not have been told that it was the only spice rack in the restaurant because they didn't realize they'd have to give it up. The waitress had to promise to bring it back to them when we were done with it. The whole thing was just weird and a little uncomfortable.

Synopsis - poor choices on climate control, awful tempura, boring main dishes, and friendly service."}
{"text":"As many other yelpers have stated, the place has a horrible delivery service. When they say \"1 hour\" expect more like 1.5 to 2 hours. Don't plan your meetings around your lunch because you won't get to eat in time."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here the other night and it was so awful that we had to throw it away. Zero flavor or spice even though we asked for a spicy level of 5. Ordered pad that and Thai fried rice. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"terrible. ordered the teriyaki and tempura dinner box, which is described as salmon teriyaki and shrimp tempura, and i got dry chicken teriyaki and a styrofoam container with three shrimp and a bunch of inedible fried veggies with most of the breading falling off. called and explained and the person on the phone was dismissive and said all she could do was put in a complaint with the chef. ridiculous, waste of $20. delivery guy was cool though."}
{"text":"Ordered in from this location.  The food was pretty awesome.  To be specific, the summer rolls were AMAZING and the pad thai was pretty good.  I hope they maintain their standards because I definitely plan to order from here again.  

Prices and delivery were as expected."}
{"text":"I love the food! However, the process to place online orders is frustrating and very time consuming. It deters our future business.."}
{"text":"Very good food and recommended! Ordered volcano chicken and taste great!"}
{"text":"The food is good~~hang out with friends after finals!! Pad Thai is awesome! And love the appetizer combo!"}
{"text":"pad tai tastes good, the chicken is tender, the service is good too.  also it is a quiet place which is good for dating."}
{"text":"Have ordered several times, each time hoping for the last to have been a fluke, but nope! Terrible, always incorrect orders! And then they just say \"oh sorry\" with no money refunded, no rectification. Today, I ordered a bento box and tempura veggies, and asked for eel sauce (which is absolutely needed for me to enjoy my sushi), and even paid extra for the eel sauce. My order arrives, no longer hot, with soggy tempura (gross!), and NO eel sauce, and NO tempura sauce which is supposed to come automatically with tempura! Without sauce, my entire meal is inedible! Try eating plan spaghetti with no sauce, or a dry sandwich with no sauce/condiments. Gross. Completely ruined meal. And this is about the 3rd time they've done this. How difficult is it to send the correct sauce, which I PAID EXTRA for? Really unbelievable, and a massive waste of money. I'm a student with not much money, and was looking forward to treating myself to some tasty sushi and tempura, and instead I just threw money away, spent several frustrating minutes on the phone with the restaurant getting nowhere, and now still have no food to eat. Thanks a lot guys, I will never be ordering from Thai Hana again."}
{"text":"I had been planning on making my own food, but iga didn't have the ingredients so I had to settle for getting something delivered.

I ordered beef mee siam with a spice level of 7. The delivery arrived in 15-20 minutes, which I was very happy about! Portions were gigantic and could probably feed 3.

However, the noodles were bland. Not much flavor, so I put some soy sauce in. Also, I could barely taste any spice: a level of 3 at the most. The only thing that was seasoned was the noodles, so eating the beef or veggies plain tasted kind of gross. The vegetables also seemed like they were frozen (the mushrooms and baby carrots in particular). 

I like their beef noodle soup though so I'll probably stick to that or curry, as I see reviewers like the massaman curry.

2 stars for food, 5 for delivery/service."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery. The sushi arrived warm and the avocado was already turning brown. The see yew was the worst I have ever had and tasted nothing like sew yew. The noodles were even all stuck together. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Pad see eew is always amazing! (Have been to this restaurant way more times than I would like to admit haha!) 
Delivery takes a while but the food is great."}
{"text":"To be honest, I had low expectations for Thai Hana when I visited, but they totally proved me wrong. I got the mee siam, and although it wasn't the authentic version I pictured, it was still pretty good. Our server was extremely nice too. She forgot to exclude beansprouts from my dish as I requested, which ticked me off a little at first. But as soon as she realized she had forgotten, she immediately apologized and offered to give me a new plate (which I declined because it didn't matter that much anymore). 

My friend and I also used the Yelp offer and got a free Thai iced tea each. Super worth it! Because it's free, I thought it would be a smaller version but it came in a full-sized glass (: I'm usually picky about my Thai iced tea, but this one had just the right amount of sweetness and tea aroma to it. Way to go, Thai Hana! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We order here for lunch at least twice per week. Their sushi is some of the best that I have had. They keep me coming back. I also love that they use sweet potatoes in their massaman curry dish."}
{"text":"I really should have read the reviews before ordering but I was in the mood for Thai food and it was gross and rainy out. This was one of the few places that delivered (or so they said). I ordered food an hour and a half ago for delivery (Pad Thai and a Thai Iced Tea). Still no food. I called the restaurant and they are closed! Now I'm starved, have no food in the house and have to either walk outside in the rain searching for food or order delivery from somewhere else that hopefully will actually arrive."}
{"text":"$5 delivery fee when they screw up your order and come late. Anyone with a delivery fee that high isn't getting a tip. Guess it's so people don't order since apparently there are no drivers or anyone with common sense."}
{"text":"I just had food delivered. It's not only the worst Thai but possibly the worst food I've ever had in my life.  It's like eating salt straight out of the shaker. So gross I had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Love this Oakland restaurant! The food is great and the prices are decent - especially for lunch. The lemongrass chicken is my favorite - they are very generous with the lemongrass and always let me substitute noodles for rice. Would definitely recommend it if you are in Oakland for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Frayed rice +edamame + tom yum soup+ the crab of course ..  The service is fast , you have to come the minute your break is began"}
{"text":"Food was spot on, perfectly delicious! I got a little worried after reading the reviews on here but I loved it. I came after lunchtime around 230p for my food to go. It wasn't very busy, someone helped me right away. Service was nice and got me my food quickly, within 10 minutes. 

Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I only tried the red curry with rice so I can't vouch for everything. But the curry was perfectly spiced and creamy. I told them mild, spice level about a 2 and I've never been to a Thai place that has given me the exact spice level I've wanted. The portion size was good and I absolutely loved it. Willing to give this place another try!"}
{"text":"Good Asian food in Pittsburgh is hard to find. That being said, this place has average Asian food. I ordered the green garden plate and it was pretty decent, but nothing extraordinary. Although it was drenched in sauce, but that's most Asian restaurants. It does get busy for lunch, so be ready to wait a bit to get in. If you're not picky with you're Asian food come here."}
{"text":"Thai Hana is a pretty good Thai place =) I really like the Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle with basil) especially when they put a good amount of spice on. 

I LOVE their Thai Iced Tea!!! 

You should be careful with the spice level though, some days I say 7 level spice out of 10 and it tastes like there is 0 spice but others I'll say 5-6 and its inedible with too much spice, so just be careful! 

The takeout portions are pretty good, but remember to specify how much hot sauce on the side you want because they may give you a cup that isn't full. 

Overall, this is a pretty good place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken drunken noodles here, but the type of noodle they served was not the flat, chewy noodles. They serve the pad thai noodles with the drunken noodle dish, and the flavor just isn't the same. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the flavor would have been better, had the noodles been different. There was a special going on (free appetizer if you show proof of check-in on facebook), but it's not a place I would openly recommend at this time."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and had the duck soup. It was super yummy! The waitstaff are a little spacey (they forgot my tea), but were very polite and attentive otherwise. I'll definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch with my Thai friend. The meesiam with tofu and the green curry we ordered are tasty. Really love it!"}
{"text":"Good taste! Wonderful diner! Good time with girlfriend. Lunch special is awesome and cheap good amount of food ."}
{"text":"We've ordered in from Thai Hana several times for dinner. The food came quickly and was excellent. For dinner we have tried several do the dishes with red curry being a current favorite.

I've been to Thai Hana twice for lunch now. Service is excellent and fast. Both times I got one of the lunch bento boxes. The bento boxes are a great value for the amount of food. The sushi is excellent."}
{"text":"Good Thai Red Curry and the waitress was possibly the nicest and most helpful I have come across. However I was a little disappointed in Thai Fried rice, the one time I had that. Overall though will definitely go over again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the lunch service, mostly because I looked online and saw that they had sushi.  Unfortunately, for some reason today their sushi bar was not in service.  As such, I mildly panicked about not having prepared to look for other gluten free items.  However, when asked the waiter immediately had answers for me and didn't miss a beat.  He indicated that the curries and the pad thai were gluten free.  Cue epic battle of wills trying to decide between the Mango Curry and the Chicken Pad Thai.  This time, the Pad Thai won out and to be honest I was pretty happy with the results.  The food came out heinously fast and the portion size was enormous ( defs took 3/4 of it home).  If you like spicy food, like I do, you might want to over call your spice level.  I ordered a \"5\" hoping to get like an after taste of spice/ a tingle and the result was maybe an increase in flavor but no real spice.  Maybe I'll try a 7 next time, and there will be a next time.  Anyway the Pad Thai had a grilled taste to it like it was made in a well loved wok and the chicken was moist.  Most importantly though, no contamination issues.  In summation, great place to get a friendly/ well served, quick, gluten free lunch with a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I ordered mee siam and it's great! Huge serving size too! I'm taking half of it home. The service was great and the food come pretty fast"}
{"text":"I walked by this place so so many times and finally decided to stop in for dinner. I had no idea I was missing out! The dining room is so cute, comfy, and clean. The menu is more extensive that one would probably think. And my pad Thai was delicious! A lot of food for not that much money. I came back for a second time with friends for lunch, and the lunch portion was still pretty big. Depending on when you go, you can get sushi from the bar."}
{"text":"I used GrubHub to order from this place on quite a few occasions.  The food was always bland, pedestrian, but nothing to complain too much about and since they delivered to me, I let it slide. 
Last night 12/1/2014 my boyfriend and I were having rough days/nights from work and didn't feel like preparing a meal after all the holiday festivities.  So we ordered Thai Hana at around 7:00. I got a confirmation that the food would arrive around 8:00 (which seemed normal). 7:27 p.m. I get an update \"Your food is on it's way\".  Woah that was quick I think!  8:10 p.m. rolls around, no food. I call grubhub, they call the restaurant and advise me \"Food will be there around 8:28, driver is in route to you\".  The driver calls me at 8:32 and says \"oh man I hit traffic but I'm on my way to you should be there shortly I'll call when I arrive\". My bf and I are a little annoyed but honestly, we're understanding people so we let it slide.  Now it's 9:00 p.m. and we ordered our food 2 hours ago, and we are aggitated.  I call GrubHub again, they say they were advised by this location that my food was already delivered. I correct them.  It was not. They call the facility again, they tell grubhub again that they got a little backed up but the food should be there shortly.  9:27 p.m. the driver calls me AGAIN and says AGAIN \"Hey I'm on my way I got stuck in traffic I'll be there in 2 min.\" 9:35 driver shows up.  
Food was cold.
Food was terrible.

Midnight my bf wakes up to throw up for the next 5 hours, he ended up sleeping in the bathroom until he had to get up and shower and get ready to go to work.  Poor thing.
I did NOT get sick, but he looked like a green ghost. My stomach is still a little queasy feeling but atleast I managed to keep my terrible food down. 

When it comes down to it, their service sucks, their drivers suck, their food is sub-par, and somehow it took them 2 1/2 hours to deliver 1 order of Maki Rolls, Drunken Noodle, Curry. and a ginger salad.  On top of that the Maki & Curry made my bf violently ill and the Noodles and Salad made me feel nauseated. 

We're done with you Thai Hana and hopefully no one else has to suffer in the future when they order from you."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite place in Pittsburgh to get Pad Thai, but I also end up going here more often because it's cheaper. Huge portion, and you can get a free Thai iced tea for checking in. I want to try their sticky mango rice, but I'm always full and the one time I wasn't they were out of mango for the day. Must be delicious if they sell out. Someday I'll try it."}
{"text":"My visit here has been phenomenal!

The chicken teriyaki salad is both filling and healthy. A hefty lunch serving for just under $9.00.

I would visit again."}
{"text":"The food is great! I went there together with my friend tonight and ordered the curry there. The 3 degree spicy is suitable to me. I think is acceptable. The rice is good and makes me feeling That I have gone back to Asia. The shrimp is a little bit plain but it's tasty. The environment is cosy, relaxed and comfortable. A place that I will choose to come again..."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite in Oakland - they do have lunch specials! I love their ginger salad as it is made with fresh ginger. 

Negatives here:
- service is ALWAYS hit or miss. If your in for lunch and on a timeframe, tell them at the beginning because otherwise you're sitting there waiting for your drinks, then food, then bill, then credit card.
- I wouldn't recommend for dinner. Atmosphere is great and casual for lunch but I guess it all depends on what you look for in dinner locations."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. Go there! Their lunch special is one of the better deals in Oakland. You won't be disappointed with the Cashew Chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered Pineapple Fried Rice and a side salad with ginger dressing. I was a little irritated about the price (18.62), but the portion size immediately changed my mind. Fried rice had great flavors. Delivery was quick, driver was friendly. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Very very good  place - I ordered the Garlic Chicken bento box and it was delicious. The sushi that came with it was very tasty as well, and whenever I'm in Pittsburgh I have a hard time getting tasty sushi like you do on coastal cities. The wife ordered a pad thai chicken bento box and it was equally delicious. 

The only negatives were the staff needed an extra body during the lunch hours. But they were really trying to do everything at once so I didn't mind. And the miso soup needed work, it was very watery but not bad, just not good either. Not much flavor. But it's a Thai restaurant that serves Japanese as a secondary. No biggie."}
{"text":"If Yelp did half stars, I'd probably give 3.5 stars. Thai Hana isn't as good as other Thai places I've had in the area, but it's really convenient to work, so we go semi often for lunch.

They have great lunch specials. Under $9 for a lunch that I always get leftovers from. And it tastes good. I usually get a noodle dish since I feel like noodles reheat better than rice does, but all of their food is decent. I like the Mee Siam best. It's a thin rice noodle with curry powder. It's a really great deal.

Service is always quick too. It can get pretty crowded, but the food is always done quickly and to your spice specification. I feel like things are never as spicy as I expect them to be, but it seems a little inconsistent. Definitely not the best Thai place in the city, but it's good and I keep going back."}
{"text":"Thai Hana has started to grow on me since the first time I ate food from their restaurant. Full disclosure, I've only ever eaten take-out, so I can't judge their in-dining service, just their take-out service.

The first time I ordered from them was an interesting experience. I ordered it as I left work so I could pick it up before traveling out of town, and the food was actually listed as \"ready\" on my app within a couple minutes, no exaggeration. It was ridiculously speedy. When I finally got there and picked up my food I was able to enjoy my order of spicy tuna and their Bento Box A while on the road. On the plus side my order had LOTS of food - way more than I expected! - but admittedly it was not all what I expected it to be, i.e. a few extra ingredients and items showed up in the bento box that I didn't expect. A little clarification on their ordering menu could fix that, though. The food was of mixed quality as well - some rolls were absolutely delicious, others were pretty \"meh.\" I guess the ingredients just weren't evenly distributed when things were made that time around?

The second time I ordered from them months later was all around much better. I ordered their DELICIOUS aloha rolls and a cup of soup, and I devoured that meal before my evening meetings with gusto. Because mmmmm, was it good! No complaints this time around! Now after that I'm dying to try even more of their special sushi rolls.

Oh, and I got a better look at the inside of this place the last time I picked up dinner. The interior of Thai Hana is cute, bright, and colorful - I'd definitely consider eating here sometime. And yes, the other dishes I saw at peoples' tables here were as enormous as the first time I'd ordered a bento box. So hopefully one of these days I can enjoy a sit-down meal at Thai Hana, but hey, in the meantime it's nice to know they have super quick take-out and pretty good sushi!"}
{"text":"I am wary of reviewing restaurants from which I have only had delivery or takeout. I've never been to Thai Hana, so I can't comment on the in-restaurant service, but I've had the delivery enough times to know how I feel about the food.

The curry is good. It's thick and creamy and consistent in its spice level. It's full of vegetables and chicken and comes with an ample serving of fluffy rice. It's good. The pad see ew... less good. The allure of pad see ew, for me, is the giant chewy delightful noodles. I'd be fine doing away with the chicken and vegetables and just going at a huge pile of pad see ew noodles. The noodles from Thai Hana are thin, like pad Thai noodles, and the sauce was just too sweet for me to enjoy. I feel as though my dining life revolves around finding a Thai restaurant that has equally good curry and noodles... my search continues. But my boyfriend doesn't mind it, so I'm not docking multiple stars for the (in my opinion) lousy pad see ew.

I can comment on the delivery service. The delivery fellow is always earlier than expected and pleasant and the food comes hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I have ordered and picked up lunch for over 10 people at Thai Hana, and also have eaten in restaurant with a smaller group.  Both times I have been delighted with the food and service.

My most recent visit to Thai Hana was with a group of 3.  I ordered the 2 roll lunch, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon, and the sushi was really tasty, and big enough to be STUFFED after 2 rolls.  My friends got fried rice and an eggplant dish and both were very pleased with their meals.  The real star of this joint, though, is the service.  Our waiter was really what made Thai Hana stand out apart from all other lunch sites in Oakland.  He was friendly, even though he was busy, and really made us feel welcome and special.  He joked around with us, suggested items, and was very prompt with our order.  He recommended the Thai Iced Tea, one of my favorites, which I didn't even know they had. 

Next time you're in Oakland treat yourself to lunch or dinner at Thai Hanna!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent but they must only have one driver. 2/2 times the food has taken [way] over an hour. Very frustrating when you're told \"up to 45 mins\" and it ends up being 1:15-1:30. No explanation. No apology. If you're hungry now, or plan on being hungry and want delivery.... Consider faster option. Come on guys..."}
{"text":"We had the gyoza, crispy volcano chicken and  pad see eew, all were super delish! We came because I found the Thai tea on the menu and it is rare to find a place that knows how to make it right! You are able to choose your spice level, I'm pretty weak and chose a 1, which is about all I could handle."}
{"text":"We have ordered rice, ramen and some sushi. The sushi and ramen are fine, but the rice is a bit salty."}
{"text":"I have been very on the edge about trying this place after reading it's health reviews, but I threw caution to the wind and I'm glad I did. It is Oakland Restaurant Week and they offered yellow chicken curry for $6. I must say that this was some of the best curry I have had. It has peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, and chicken. I do not like my curry spicy and it was perfect. Amazingly sweet and creamy with the right amount of spice. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with a delivery order. Will not be eating here again. We ordered a pad thai and a pad see ew. The pad thai (spice level 5) was completely bland - no flavor. The pad see ew (spice level 4) was completely covered in pepper flakes and way too spicy. It also had thin noodles, not pad see ew noodles in it, and was not a full portion. We called, and were basically told that they ran out of pad see ew and instead of calling us back to tell us, they just decided to substitute whatever they felt like. 
Also - when did delivery people stop coming to your door? We pre-tipped (a really decent tip for a short delivery) and when the food arrived, instead of bringing it to the door, they called and had us walk out to the car where they leaned out the door. They couldnt even be bothered to get out of the car."}
{"text":"Lovely little place with excellent sushi and entrees.  My son and I split the Hana Bridge sushi combo, it was beautiful and delicious, my husband got the Yaki Udon, also amazing.  This will now be my go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers authentic Thai food. I ordered massaman curry and tom yum soup. They are yummy. The waitress was also from Thailand."}
{"text":"I'm mixed between a three and a 2.5. The food here is not authentic Thai at all. I got the tom kha, and panang curry on my latest meal there, and was disappointed in both :( The arent a lot of flavor in the tom kha, especially that coconutty goodness from coco milk, which is expected and differentiate this and its cousin tom yum. But i saw or tasted non of that. And the panang curry i got 8/10 but it wasnt even remotely spicy, and it was so bland yet greasy i got sick after a few bites. However the not so expensive cost does weighted things out a little bit."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and been pretty satisfied each time.  Yesterday, I got the Chicken Teryaki lunch special which was a massive amount for $8.50.  We also ordered California Rolls and, as it was my first time ever trying them, I was pretty impressed.  I stopped in around 1 and there were about two tables left.  I think that UPMC and Pitt employees frequent it mostly at this time, so I don't think it would be too hard to find a table if you just space it in between lunch breaks.  I had the Pad Thai in the spring and I wasn't super fond of it, but the Chicken Teryaki redeemed Thai Hana in my opinion.  Definitely worth a stop and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Hit or Miss! I work in the area so been to Thai Hana several times. Strictly ok. Some of the lunch specials like the cashew lunch and curries are alright. Pad thai - a signature dish is just bad. They give out a plate of noodles with some pieces of meat/veggies depending upon the order. Just tasteless. Most of their food is too salty and when told so they pretend like they dont understand English."}
{"text":"So inconsistent that I'm giving up.  Pad thai isn't that difficult - or shouldn't be.  5/10 was so spicy it was inedible the first time, 3/10 was perfect last time.  This time my 3/10 pad thai was delivered with no spice, little sauce (the noodles were all stuck together) and no peanuts to be seen.  It ended up in the trash and I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Mediocre. I got beef noodle soup and panang curry. I wasn't a fan of the texture of the beef - quite chewy."}
{"text":"I am going to go ahead an add a star for the service and relaxed atmosphere.  I had the Bento C  $12.95 and it was enough sushi to feed a family of 4.  The Bento C consisted of all cooked :
eel roll the sauce was magnificent I even tried to dip my other sushi pieces into it.
Shrip, krab and tomago,  before this meal I had never had tomago fish and I never want to again.
Fish Tempura - tasty but small
and 6 pieces of the super crunchy  I loved the idea of the roll it was coated in a tempura batter and fried. I did not care for the spicy mayo that was drizzled on the roll.  I would have liked if they included that in the dish description."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai and some spring rolls from here via Grubhub recently, and it was a good experience overall. Everything arrived as I'd ordered it and was packaged really neatly. I had an extra spring roll too, which was nice. The food didn't wow me since the Pad Thai noodles themselves were a bit dry, hence the reason for only 3 stars. It could have been an off day however, and the price and convenience of having food delivered was well worth it. I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"The pad Thai here is on the bland side, but I recommend the drunken noodles. Tasty and spicy!"}
{"text":"I read some good reviews about this place so I ordered two most popular items on their menu and the description is underneath..

1. Pad thai noodles:
    WORST Pad thai I have ever tasted in my entire life. I especially asked to make Pad thai extra spicy but when I got it, there was zero spice. Let alone the spice, the noodles had no shrimp (which I did order) and it had absolutely no peanut sauce. It was just a big bowl of plain noodles which I could have made in my house with some chicken.


2. Panang curry
    Again..Specially asked them to make it extra spicy but it came with no spice. 

Both the dishes were absolutely disappointing.."}
{"text":"Expensive, but the Gai Grappo is worth it."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to try Thai Hana. It's a great place for lunch in Oakland, especially with their lunch pricing. I had the Chicken Pad Thai and it was great! There is more seating in the place than I thought there would be, so it is nice for groups of 2 - 4. It may be more difficult for larger groups if you get there at noon, but at 11:15 I had my choice of tables.

The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive.

My only complaint is that spicy level 7 didn't have enough of a kick to it. I'll know next time to go higher -- but the chili paste addition made it just fine!

I'll be back soon (and probably a little too often!) :)"}
{"text":"I ordered from Thai Hana using GrubHub. The order came pretty quickly, around 20-25 minutes. I ordered the beef pad see ew. It is slightly on the more expensive side, being $11.95; however, the portion is very generous. It can probably last me 3 meals.
The noodles are delicious. They are very flavorful and slightly sweet. There are also baby corn, broccoli, and carrots, so you get a decent amount of vegetables. The beef is pretty tender; however, it is slightly on the dry side.
The dish reheats pretty well, but the noodles do get sticky, as expected. I would suggest sharing with a friend."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times now. Their location is prime for a lot of hospital employees and students. They get real busy during lunch time but customers can call in their order beforehand and pick up their food. As far as Thai places go, this place is pretty fair with a good selection on their menu. I have tried a variety of dishes here and have enjoyed all of them."}
{"text":"Four stars only because it's the best Thai option for when you're craving Thai in Oakland. Outside of Oakland, definitely 3 stars. Good panang curry and pad Thai!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place so much and it is a second home to me. The service is unmatchable and the food is impeccable. I literally need Thai hana at least once a week to survive. Amazing Thai amazing fried rice amazing sushi an all around amazing place. 10% off of you pay with cash as well. Highly recommend this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"We were waiting for delivery for about an hour and a half when we were promised 40-45 minutes. Apparently driver got into an accident and neither driver or anyone from the restaurant was trying to warn us. When we called 2nd time to find out what was the problem the person just hang up on us and did not pick up the phone when we were trying to call back. The most ridiculous delivery experience ever!"}
{"text":"I like that they have gluten free options and that they deliver."}
{"text":"I was craving Pad Thai for lunch the other day, and this was one of the first things that popped up on Yelp. Although we just missed lunch time with the $8.95 version, I ended up getting the dinner portion of chicken Pad Thai ($11.95).

First, this place is crazy fast. We were in and out in 40 minutes, which is really good in Oakland for sit down. Unfortunately, the food was only OK. The other reviewers are not over exaggerating on the spice levels being non-existent. I ordered my food at a 4, and there was 0 spice. My lips did not even tingle. Pad Thai is fairly bland so this was a big let down.

Service was very polite and obviously fast. If you need a quick lunch in Oakland, this is an OK option."}
{"text":"The eel and avocado sushi were good. I've got no complaint on that. I liked the almond slices they had on top of the sushi which added some crunchy texture to it. But the way they did the Pad Thai completely ruined the dish. It was WAY TOO SWEET and all other flavors (if any) were overpowered. I'd say even my college dining hall did a better job at this dish. The price was reasonable. I might come back for the sushi."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place because they're on GrubHub and it's freezing outside, so that's nice! The delivery was much faster than I thought. It was delivered in around 15 minutes, super fast! The food was good. I ordered the pad Thai and crispy rolls. The crispy rolls were good, not greasy and very crispy. The Pad Thai was ok. It wasn't as flavorful as I prefer it, but it was good. I will definitely order from them again, I'll probably just try something else."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed a place before after half a year  but I had to this time for Thai Hana.

I arrived right before the lunch rush hour, only two tables were occupied but we were not seated or even acknowledged for a good five minutes. What's worse is that three other groups were seated before us.

So we finally sat down after being directed to a tiny table in the corner by the waitress, took them another 10 minutes to acknowledge that we existed. We never were given water, and when we finally flagged someone down for our water it took them another 5 minutes for them to bring water to every other table before finally bringing ours. Our order ended up coming in after all the other tables. As of now (25 minutes in) I still have no utensils. 

I understand that they're in a busy college area, but they really need to improve their service especially for a higher price point.

I ordered the sashimi lunch special and the bf ordered Pad See Ew with chicken. He was given fried rice instead.. The waiter was nice enough to bring us the right food, but that took another 10 minutes.

Overall the food was OK, not bad but nothing to write home about either. We are not coming back unfortunately, but if anyone wants to try this place, I'd recommend avoiding rush hours."}
{"text":"An outstanding Thai restaurant in Oakland, PA! Excellent soup Pad Thai and hot basil! All with chicken!

Really great service.. will come here again and again!"}
{"text":"I am not really sure what took me so long to try Thai Hana. Came here during the week for dinner and it wasn't overly busy. We were quickly seated and handed the menu. I decided to go with the chicken red curry and that was absolutely amazing. Rich, little spicy, lots of chicken and some vegetables. I couldn't stop eating and definitely have found my place! I still need to try a couple of other dishes, but even if they would completely fail, I would go there only for the curry! :) The price was okay for the portion size, the staff nice and friendly and the service quick! Definitely a new go-to place for me."}
{"text":"Oakland is having their restaurant week right now and I decided to come check out Thai Hana. Thai is usually more expensive, so I was excited to see their Yellow Chicken Curry with rice for only $6!

It's located right on 5th where most of the other restaurants are. It's a small shop but they have enough tables for several guests to sit comfortably. 

I was greeted as soon as I entered the door. Ordering my take out was an easy process. It took a little over 5 minutes to get my curry. Not bad for lunch time. 

The curry itself was delicious. The chicken was still juicy. Sometimes, it can get dried out but that wasn't a problem here. The yellow curry had a sweet element to it, which I enjoyed. It has peas, carrots, and sweet potatoes in it. It came with Jasmine rice on the side. 

I believe lunch portions are typically $8.25, so this is definitely a great value."}
{"text":"I had takeout and wasn't expecting much since I'd never heard of it and it didn't seem like authentic Japanese. Wow, the sushi is super fresh and wonderful! What a nice surprise.  No idea on the service."}
{"text":"A very polite and considerate girl was attending to us.
Good food, great quantity and affordable prices.
Chicken satay and the basil fried rice were great!

Parking would be the only bummer! So, if you plan to go here, park your vehicle before you reach the place!"}
{"text":"Thai Hana is a small restaurant in Oakland.  I have been here a few times for lunch--I can't comment on the sushi or large plates, as I have always ordered a lunch special.  It's a pretty good deal at $7.95 for a healthy portion of stir fry or curry and your choice of white or brown rice.  Bonus points because they don't price gouge you for choosing whole grain!

Their vegetables are always fresh--you can tell they don't use the frozen stuff.  My go-to order is green curry tofu, and I vary the spice between 8 and 10.  They are WAAAAAY less hot here than at other Thai places in the city I've been too, so don't be afraid to go a little higher than you normally would...though I'm the last person you want to ask about that! ;)"}
{"text":"Delivery was an hour late and when I call the restaurant l, no one picks up the phone to explain. Super bad service."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the sashimi and sushi as I haven't tried anything else. However, for me, sticking to these items is for good reason. I honestly haven't had sashimi and sushi this fresh at this reasonable of a price in Pittsburgh. Lunch is even better at a cheaper rate than dinner. I made it a point to write a review because I was apprehensive about trying this place in the beginning because of the three and a half star rating. I am so glad I gave it the benefit of the doubt though. I will definitely be coming back here over and over again if the quality and prices stay like this!

Reading the other reviews, I would like to say that this place just opened earlier this year so perhaps they were just getting their bearings. Currently, I feel that the in-restaurant service has been great and I've been here both during the lunch rush hour and the less busy dinner time."}
{"text":"Not a bad little hole in the wall place amongst all the flashy restaurants in Oakland. Very chill atmosphere, nice for a date, softly lit but not too dark. This would be awesome for dinner, though I'm having lunch right now.  Got my appetizer in less than 5 min, food even sooner after that. I ordered the $6 special for restaurant week, and checking in gets me crispy rolls for free!

The crispy rolls are nice and crispy, but flavorless without the sauce. The garlic chicken $6 special looks decent, but QUITE oily. A little too oily. Since I'm not very well-versed in Thai food, the tangy nature of the garlic sauce was new, so I'm not sure if that's standard or simply Thai Hana's take on it. Not bad, but different. Ironically, when I went home and had the leftovers later, they were pretty delicious, and I was having them cold! 

Decent place, but kind of average Thai place. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. I have to try the drunken noodles, though, which I've heard are awesome! I'd have to give it 3.5 stars, for sure."}
{"text":"My cousin and I were suckered in to try this place because of the free thai tea promotion. We did street parking. It's super confusing if you're from out of town like us. There are a lot of one-way streets, so we passed the restaurant a couple times before we found parking. Free street parking after 6pm. The service here was below average. When we walked in, there was no one there and all the workers just stared at us for a hot second before offering us a table to sit at.  All was forgiven since we were able to redeem our free thai tea. I ordered the basil fried rice with pork. They cooked the basil perfectly! It really saved the dish. The rest of it was nothing special. I used a lot of their chili oil to add to the taste. My cousin got the pad thai which was super watery. It lacked color and taste. Either it was just a poor batch or their pad thai is NOT GOOD! Overall, my dish was okay and free thai tea was nice, but the 2/5 stars is for the pad thai and service."}
{"text":"Have been back to this place twice, and the quality remained the same. The sushi I had was phenomenal and really made with tons of attention to deal, even at lunch time. Staff was very friendly and helpful and the lunch specials are priced just right!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but the last few times I have been there they completely fell off. They served me a meal I always get that was missing 4 out of 5 veggies. They never notified me they were missing items, I had to figure it out on my own. I had to ask them to rectify the situation with some other items which they did but the dish did not taste the same. If they are out of things they should just tell people before they order it. Another situation I ordered an appetizer that never came, turns out they did not have anymore of it. Once again just notify the customer so they aren't expecting their food to come."}
{"text":"I found this place through GrubHub, an app for ordering delivery or pickup from real restaurants, as opposed to the mundane chained pizza places like Papa John's. I use GrubHub frequently while traveling because I am often too lazy to go out. Ordering from Thai Hana is a perfect example of how GrubHub should work.

GrubHub usually takes a while, so I placed an order while shopping at 6:50PM. The promised time for arrival was about 8PM. This was a little longer than I expected, but that's ok - better than nothing. In the comments, I wrote, \"Will not be at hotel until 7:45PM.\" 

GrubHub sent updates accordingly - when the order went to the kitchen, an updated time when the driver was supposed to arrive (between 7:50 and 8PM), etc. The driver arrived at my room precisely at 7:56PM. He even called beforehand to ensure I was at the hotel in my room, since he actually read my comment. I was impressed.

I ordered Tom Yum Shrimp soup ($3.95), Crispy Rolls ($4.95), and Pad Thai ($11.95). Add tax ($1.56), a delivery charge ($1.50), and tip ($3.58), and the total was $27.49. That's not bad, considering I'm ordering from a real restaurant!

The soup was ok. It had a lot of lemongrass and could've used more spice. The crispy rolls were good, and so was the Pad Thai. I can't complain about either of the latter two items, which is rare for me. They both had the right taste, and the portion size was appropriate (see picture).  

If I was ever in the area again, I would order from here. The food is good, and the service is as promised. You can't really ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Try this place for a first time  and really enjoy it .great sushi with a nice presentation.I prefer get it delivered"}
{"text":"Ordered through GrubHub.  Took forever to deliver.  Spicy tuna roll wasn't very spicy, but I believe it was indeed tuna.  Probably.  The steamed veggie dumplings were like tater tots with veggie filling.  The Pad Thai (which did not describe ANY protein in it on the menu) had chicken (?) and shrimp in it. It wasn't spicy at all and was rather clumpy and somehow bland.  How does that happen?  

Well...it was food.  I think."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and the food was master crafted, I ordered the pad Thai, and miso soup."}
{"text":"I had the Gia Granpo with a spicy tuna roll. The Gia was a fried shrimp stir fry in basil soy/syrup sauce (similar to general tso's). I order the dish at the maximum spicy level of 10 out of 10. In order to make the dish spicy, all the kitchen did was sprinkle some red chili flakes; thus, the Gia was not remotely spicy. In sum, it was flavorful but too sweet for me.

The spicy tuna roll came with ten small rolls each with a minuscule portion of tuna. As I expected, it wasn't spicy, but I was sure to use a generous amount of wasabi.

On a more positive note, Thai Hana does institue a BYOB policy."}
{"text":"Hard to explain how bad their Shrimp Pad Thai is. But I'll give it a shot. Imagine cooked rice noodles and cooked shrimp. That's it. No sauce, no flavor, no complexity, no effort, no passion, no purpose, no sustenance--need I say more? I have no clue how this passes as Thai much less a restaurant. I would ask for a refund but I'm going to pretend this experience never occurred."}
{"text":"This place gets one star because the sushi is passable, however, delivery takes about 3 hours and the other menu items were absolutely horrible. I ordered Tom kha soup and the \"coconut milk\" broth had completely separated. Milky on top and clear on the bottom. It tasted as if they mixed milk with key lime juice and added sugar to it. The chicken was rubbery and they added canned mushrooms. It was completely inedible. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery sushi from here through GrubHub and it was pretty ok (especially considering \"Thai\" and not \"Sushi\" is in the name of the restaurant. But you make compromises when there's nothing within walking distance of your hotel, right?

I ordered a Dragon Roll and a Fireworks roll - both were nicely rolled and were quite huge. One would satisfy a moderately hungry person. The fish was ok - fresh enough but the tuna was a little mushy, and though they were advertised as having \"spicy\" sauce, it was only spicy in comparison to Heinz 57. (Did you like that Pittsburgh reference?) 

That said, the delivery guy was super nice and my order arrived when promised. Not bad for delivery sushi."}
{"text":"I order here every other day and the food always comes hot and delicious. Delivery is usually quick (30 min).

I've had a lot of Thai food and this place is my favorite. Two dish recommendations: Basil Fried Rice and Drunken Noodles. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I given this restaurant a couple of tries, hoping that I'd like it better, but nope, no luck. 

The quality of the food is very low, especially compared to the myriad of great thai places in Pittsburgh. The price of the food and the portion size may be an attraction for customers, but the food is definitely not the best. 

I ordered the pad thai, a classic staple in thai cuisine, and it was a large portion of overcooked and over-sauced rice noodles. There was a pool of sauce at the bottom of the plate/container that didn't actually absorb into the noodles. 

If you want thai food, try other places for a more authentic experience."}
{"text":"Thai Hana is a nice little place to eat with friends. If you're looking for a completely authentic Southeast Asian meal, this may not be the place for you. However, the food is not bad at all and will likely suits most tastes. The yellow curry and Thai iced tea (free with a check in!) were quite sweet, but I personally still enjoyed it. I went with friends on a Saturday night, and there were only a couple other tables filled. The restaurant is slightly dim but comfortably lit, and was quiet so we could have a real conversation. Overall, I was not unhappy with the experience and it was a good restaurant to catch up with friends. Will I eat there again? Maybe. Will it become my go-to Thai restaurant? Probably not."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try this place out!! 

Service was fast and friendly. Our waitress was very sweet and continued to check in on us. 

I got the panang curry and a Thai iced tea. If you check in on yelp it's free! The panang was ~$12. It was well flavored and actually spicy!! It is rare for a lot of places around here for the food to come spicy without having to ask. The only thing is the quality of the chicken wasn't amazing and the fact that the dish was $12 made it less worth it, especially because they only give you a small bowl of rice and not that much curry. 

I'm definitely glad I got to try this place, but I wish they have more food since they're charging $12."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming in here, and will not be my last. I got off the 61D and was craving some noodles. Lo and behold right in front of me is Thai Hana! Great! I have never been there but it always seems busy so that to me signals either super cheap or good food. Either way, I was looking for both of those things. 

Now, they do have a lunch menu, it is on the back of the menu. BUT if I took a little bit more time I would have realized that they actually have TWO lunch menus. Kind of confusing since they are in different places on the menu but still it is good to know for my next trip here. 

I ordered the Chicken Mee Siam. I initially ordered it to be a spicy level 3, but at the waiter told me I had to bump that up. He said that their spicy levels are not as bad and a 3 is really a 5. I was apprehensive, but ordered the 5, and he was right, it was about the level that I wanted it to be. Thank you waiter man for that! Total price was around $8.50. The portions were large, I put half in the fridge for tomorrow, and there was a lot of chicken in the dish. Sometimes for lunch they skimp on the meat, not this time. I was impressed. 

I would have liked to get a drink for the price, not just the meal, but you can't win them all. 

The noodles were done to perfection, the veggies were crisp and tasted fresh, and it was enough to eat for two days. I think this place was a win!"}
{"text":"I have been here for the mee Siam last time and it was very good -- the portion is big and it taste delicious! I brought my friend here again for the mee Siam and she also loved it. The spice choice was very authentic too."}
{"text":"I placed an order and gave my address, they called me back an hour later telling me they could not find my address/location or parking. Can you say starved!!!! I'm located at the corner of Tech and Frew! 
There is parking everywhere. i also gave my cell number i could have went out to meet the driver. how do you serve food in Oakland and not know where CMU and Tepper is located."}
{"text":"A once a week lunch location for me. The fried rice is delicious. I have tried pad Thai and basil fried rice. A few times the beef is a bit rubbery, that's why 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered hot basil, but you barely can find basil in this dish, not spicy at all. The brown rice is good......."}
{"text":"This is 3.5. As expected in a college area the food was inexpensive, and surprisingly good with a decent number of choices.

Restaurant is a bit noisy and cramped, but this solid place to lunch."}
{"text":"First the positives......they are on GrubHub so it's super convenient to order food for delivery, they estimate an hour on GrubHub, but the food was here in less than 45 min. 

Now the negatives.....Hands down THE WORST Thai food I've ever had. I have eaten a lot of Thai food, and this sludge was the worst. I ordered Massaman Curry. Usually one of my favorite dishes because of the potatoes. WHY were the potatoes orange? Oh I know, probably from the inch and a half of oil sitting on top of the curry. Yes, I know you need oil to make curry, but an inch and a half?!?!?! Furthermore, the description didn't mention anything about tomatoes....but I had huge chunks of tomatoes......not a great addition. I will be calling for a refund...."}
{"text":"I get the red curry consistency to go. It is always delicious. Quick, friendly service. Excellent flavor and spice level. Will continue coming and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience. Here for work, and staying at a nearby hotel. The front desk gave me this menu for a delivery option. I ordered the pad thai. They asked for my name and said it'd be 45 minutes. After an hour I called the restaurant back. They said they had tried to deliver it to the front desk, but didn't have a name or number. It was an additional 20 minutes for them to re-deliver it. Now 1 hour and 20 minutes later - who knows how long the pad thai has been sitting, but it was THE worst I've ever had. I asked for it spicy, and not only was it NOT spicy but it was totally flavorless and bland. The noodles were all stuck together and it was basically inedible. To top it off, the delivery guy lectured me about not giving them a room number. Well, if you would have written my name down when I told you the first time, the front desk could have found me that way!!! Never again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. I've been coming here for years, but it's been awhile since I've been here and I must say I was very disappointed. The food use to be much better, and I don't think I'll be coming back. 
I thought I would be getting in Yelp to change my review from a 4 star review to a 2 star, but was surprised I hadn't done anything yet. One of my favorite things is their pad see ew. I love rice noodles. Unfortunately, this time around it tasted like it was made in dirty water, and without seasoning. I asked for it at a 6 and it was so bland. It really was some of the worst tasting Thai I've ever had.
Very disappointed. Sunny be lazy like me and take the time and energy to go to spice island tea House a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Massaman curry made a man out of me. The dishes are BIG and I always leave feeling full. Staff is friendly and attentive. Keep an eye out for coupons."}
{"text":"While it gets a lot of traffic because of it's convenient location,  the food itself is terrible. Their effort to balance Thai and Japanese cuisine has resulted in an epic failure of both.  I can judge the authenticity of a Thai restaurant by their tom yum goong, and their's was oddly too sweet and not enough sour. The pad thai noodles were overcooked and lacked flavor. For the quality, everything was too expensive."}
{"text":"I was going to order from here once more before I made a review, but that won't be happening. I ordered delivery through grub hub. The driver was late because he was stuck in traffic and called me while he was on his way to let me know. No big deal, I'm a pretty patient person. I ordered a soup/noodle bowl with chicken and rice noodles. It was packaged separately. I also ordered the spring rolls, which were great, just needed more sauce. 
When I reheated my soup the next day to finish it I found an entire shrimp at the bottom, tail on and everything. It was a big one!! If the chefs let this slide without even noticing, I can only wonder what else they let slide in that kitchen."}
{"text":"Have only ever eaten here via take away/delivery. Delivery time is prompt and food is always fresh and warm. Crispy rolls and chicken satay are amazing. Red curry and mango curry are impeccable. Big noodle bowls rock!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here today. 

We ordered:

Crispy Rolls - they were delicious and stayed crispy due to the restaurant taking the time to put some ventilation holes in the Styrofoam (a quick thing, but something that is appreciated when ordering something crispy)

Tom Kha Gai - delicious and spiced to the heat level we requested

Volcano Chicken - delicious! 

Pad Thai - probably the least favorite dish, but overall it was good. 

I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"service was pretty slow. there appeared to only be one waiter during dinner time. he was polite and took our order without a pad and got it all right. always an amazing skill, so props there. the food looked good but just didn't follow through. green curry just didn't have the heat you'd expect. the tofu was questionable and had an odd odor to it, some of the vegetables didn't seem cooked very well. the Thai tea was strong but wasnt to bad. the menu doesn't have much in the way of beverages... Thai tea, cans of pop, and water. the person I went with got sushi and masaman curry and wasn't really blown away either, the sweet potatoes in the curry were so uncooked that they couldn't be easily cut with a butter knife."}
{"text":"I must say I didn't have much hope for the food here the menu is so huge and that can mean disappointments. I was pleasantly suprised. The spring rolls were gently crunchy and delish but the chicken summer rolls are the best I've ever had. The combination of the cool noodles and veggies with the sweet hot chicken was just a win. I also had the tamarind duck which was awesome crispy duck in a sweet sauce. I recommend."}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai food I've had so far. My family and I ate there out of convenience since we were in Oakland. The food was very sweet, rather than spicy. I ordered the Pad Thai and they definitely did not get the dish right, even though it is a staple dish at Thai restaurants. This is not an authentic Thai place. 

Though, the price and portion size was good and might be Thai Hana's sole attraction."}
