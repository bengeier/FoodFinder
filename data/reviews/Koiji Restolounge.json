{"text":"(Just learned that it's now called Sushi Sushi)

The food is just okay. Sushi seems to be a bit watered down. Worst part however was the service. Ordered 4 dishes. Appetizer came quickly enough but the food came out spaced out too long in between. 10 mins after the ramen, the teriyaki rice bowl came out. And nearly ten after that, the sushi.

Ambience is alright."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't priced so high, I would've enjoyed myself more.
The actual quality of the food was just fine... I would suggest the salmon poke (even if it is Atlantic salmon.... boo!)
We sat in the lounge area, and the music was loud and seemed quite unsuitable. 
Not the greatest sushi experience, but not the worst."}
{"text":"Love, love, loved it....We came here on a cold winter's night and were warmed by the super friendly welcome by the server. This is some of the best service I have had in this city. The waiter took the time to explain the drinks and dishes and checked in with us often, but never too often. I was particularly impressed by how well timed our dishes were. I have never seen anything quite like this in a Japanese restaurant. Maybe I don't get out that much? 

The ambience was very trendy, yet laid back. The quality of the sushi was exquisite. All ingredients fresh and prepared perfectly, but without the bells and whistles you would find at a place like globefish. Pricey? Yes... But we have spent more for way lower quality. I can't really think of anything negative to say about this place and that says a lot."}
{"text":"The place is really nice.. Food is amazing.. My mom took me out for dinner and I ordered beef udon.. It was great not like the other udon I have tasted that's sour.. My mom got California rolls and tempura and I also got tempura yam I love tempura yam.. The serving sizes are a little bigger.. But the service is what didn't kind of like about this restaurant.. The employee didn't do much they were just standing their on their phones when there's costumers there.. And we asked for water cuz my brother was kinda choking but it took them like 5 minutes to take.. Like the other waiters were just standing there seating on their phone.. But other than that I really liked the restaurant"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was the most disappointing sushi experience I have had. There was ALOT of mayo in the sushi which really takes away from the real flavours, in my opinion. The seaweed was tough and the rice seemed dry while the filling was oozing because of the mayo. 

The decor in the place is nice, for the most part. However, it appears to have an identity crisis because they have modern \"east asian inspired\" decor, paired with sports splaying on tv screens...

I hope in the future they improve the food, because there aren't too many sushi options in the area. It would be nice to have a good one."}
{"text":"We went to this place out of chance. I had read some previously not-so-great reviews. We were kindly greeted and seated. The ambiance is nice - it's a nice restaurant. The waitress didn't come back for, I'm not sure, about 10 minutes? No water, no drink order, nothing... we just sat there and waited for what seemed like forever. So, we finally placed our order and got the Robata Skewer Platter
as an appy (bacon wrapped mochi, yakitori, quail egg, botan ebi (spot prawn), boneless beef ribs with daikon oroshi with ponzu) for $15. This was an interesting dish. I'd recommend trying it. We got a vareity of sushi rolls, but our favorite was the Mango and the Spicy Salmon - literally the best Spicy Salmon rolls I've ever had. The tempura crumbs inside just added a nice crunch kick. And the Mango was surprising - use the sauce on the plate, not soy sauce, as the sauce on the plate brings out all the yummy flavors. 

All in all, we will go back because we enjoyed the food.  People have said it's over priced, but for a nice sushi place, I think it's average price. We were stuffed when we left and our bill wasn't that huge - with tax and a $6 tip we paid $58.50 for 2 people.

I'm looking forward to trying more interesting things on the menu."}
{"text":"We were looking for some sushi but found so much more.  Hands down the best sushi/japanese restaurant in the northeast.  Get the dinner for two special (35$).  Loved the presentation. Endamame weren't too salty and the miso soup was the best soup i've had in Calgary.They also have different night specials, and they have more than sushi.  Everything was delicious. 
 Ok music was a little lame, but I like that big gold fish picture frame, is gold fish sushi any good? Loved it!"}
{"text":"expect to pay thru the teeth.  I ordered 1beer and 6 pieces of sashimi Salmon.  The bill? $21.00 ... WHAT THE...?  What is it with Calgary and its pretentious high prices?   In Vancouver, you can get a 12 pieces of sushi with miso soup for $6.95"}
{"text":"Took my mom to Koiji for her mother's day dinner because she wanted to try something new and I also purchased a groupon for this restaurant a couple months ago.  

I  made a reservation for Saturday night and I found that making reservation was unnecessary since the restaurant was not busy.  We sat down and momentarily the waiter came to serve us, provided menus and asked what we would like to drink.  So far the service was good.  (+1 point) 

And then......we sat there for about 30 minutes with our menus and just kind of waiting for our waiter to come back to take our order.  (-1 point) 

There were 3 waiters that night and all three of them were busy cleaning up and setting up for the table next to us.  It was for a table of 2.  They wiped down the table nicely and put the settings on the table and a reserved sign.  It took 2 people to do that and our waiter was busy with another table.  (0 point) 

Finally another waiter came to serve us, took our order and the groupon.  (+1 point) 
The food came out in a timely matter, which was nice.  (+1 point)  If and only if we can start eating right away, but we couldn't because we did not have any settings yet....(-1 point).  

It took another 30 minutes for us to get the waiter(s) attention to get us some more tea (-1 point).  The restaurant was not busy at all, all 3 waiters plus the cook/(also assuming the owner) were busy serving the table next to us.  Guessing it's their VIP, whereas the rest of the customers are just customers...... (-1 point).  

Food quality was not bad.  I actually quite enjoy the food (especially their Beef Tataki) even with the not-up-to-par service.  (+1) 

When we got our bill, they forgot the groupon.  Fine. Restaurant was NOT busy, so I guess it's bound to happen...... (-1 point)

Asked the waiter 3 times and he also acknowledged 3 times to pack our food to go, finally the 4th time, he realized that saying \"yes for sure I can pack that for you\" means ACTION: 'I should get that packed for you'  (-1 point).  

Interior: Overall the restaurant atmosphere is quite modern, beautiful d√©cor but it was really stuffy and hot inside.  (1 point) 
Food quality: Good.  They are not authentic Japanese food, but I do quite enjoy the food quality (ok fine, it really was the beef tataki that wins me over).  (2 points)  
Service: Well I hope you are their VIP, then you will get a very attentive top notch service, otherwise, there's a possibility that your dinning experience will be similar to mine.  (-1 point)"}
{"text":"I was invited to a birthday dinner but the food was gross and our shrimp was mushy and the server expected us to eat the tiramisu with our finger, also they said that the tiramisu was made from Ice cream but we found out it was tofu! there were extended periods of time between dishes, we waited up to 30 minutes between dishes! DO NOT DO TO THIS RESTOLOUNGE!"}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I immediately had to come here once I saw the new Koiji open. I was hoping it would offer something other Japanese restaurants in Calgary couldn't. Alas, that was not true. If you had been to Shibuya Izakaya on 16 ave, Koiji is similar in concept except Shibuya has better service and food.

Koiji is a moderately sized restaurant with a small dining area and a raised lounge-ish area. Once I walked it, the atmosphere oozed sophistication. The look was slick with dark brown/black hues for the tables and chairs, white banquette, and a tiled rock wall with a wicked fireplace. A beautiful stainless steel kitchen opens up to the customers, and a few flat screen tvs are hung up. Unfortunately, the addition of orange accents reminded me of Halloween and a multi-coloured lit food service area was a little out of place.

Besides the sushi/sashimi, most of the items on the menu wasn't 100% authentic Japanese- it was more like their interpretation and reworking of some classic Japanese dishes. For example my bf and I ordered their Chicken Karaage ($9) which was a marinated chicken deep fried and served with caper mayo. I was expecting chunks of deep fried chicken, but it turned out to be deep fried chicken wings instead. Plus, since they apparently only had two chicken wings left in the kitchen we ended up having a wing each for $6. I was really disappointed at not only the price, but that the chicken wing was bland and had some weird fish egg stuffing inside. 

We also ordered salmon and tuna rolls (nothing out of the ordinary), and one of their special rolls stuffed with cucumber and topped with a salmon-mayo mixture. There was nothing unique about it and it just left me feeling ripped off.

The service was pretty crappy. It took the waitress a long time to come over with tea, refill it when it was empty, and take our order. Since we sat right next to the open kitchen, it was terrible seeing our order sitting there and the chef looking around for the waitress to pick it up. It ended up with the manager serving us half the time.

Overall, Koiji is too expensive for what you're getting and there is nothing unique or exciting about the food. The sushi was only average and for being a lounge, they didn't have a big selection of alcohol. Will not come again and I suggest you save you money and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We first went to this restaurant shortly after it opened and today (a few months later) was our second visit.  Our impression of the restaurant on our first visit was good.  The waiting staff were friendly and accommodating.  The cooked food was good and sushi/sashimi fish were fresh.  This place really hasn't done a lot of advertising, at least not from what I can see.  The result is that this restaurant is not very busy.  I believe we were only one of three occupied tables during our second visit.  On our second visit, we ordered some sashimi and sushi.  Again, the raw fish were all very fresh.  The sushi rice on the nigiri was of the right size and have good consistency/texture and tasted okay (though not exceptional).  The waiting staff were again very friendly during our visit and checked on us regularly to make sure we were looked after."}
{"text":"Food was well prepared, my concern was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The walls were dirty and the men's room was quite unclean."}
{"text":"The spicy tuna rolls are on fire! Koiji never disappoints. It's a beautiful atmosphere, clean, and they add fruits to your water! Defintely some good strawberry water! If you're there though, try the spicy tuna rolls. I love them!"}
{"text":"Do the sushi roll, baby, roll. This is an a-ok spot for way up in northern Calgary. Met up with a couple of friends for a last minute dinner on a Wednesday eve. There was plenty of room to sit, the reso we had was unnecessary.

The food came out quickly, the sushi was pretty good. Two of us shared the sushi bar set for two. At just $35, it's an easy choice and keeps your sushi eating experience to an economical level. Sometimes it's hard to know how much you're ordering when you do it by the roll! It's also nice that it comes with miso soup. 

Bonus: Koiji has a separate gluten free menu.

If you're not a sushi freak, you'll likely enjoy it. Picky sushi connoisseur types, maybe find yourself another spot!"}
{"text":"Good Japanese food but very overpriced. I would keep this place in mind only for the rare special occasion."}
