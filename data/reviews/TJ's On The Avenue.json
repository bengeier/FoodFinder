{"text":"We stopped in to TJ's for lunch while visiting the area. Very friendly and fast service. Delicious food, from the garlic bread through the entrees and even dessert!  Wish we lived closer so we could enjoy more often!"}
{"text":"Slow service for for average Italian fare. Even when half the tables are empty on a Saturday night there was a 15-20 minute wait to be seated. It's clear the have certain pre-made favorites, because other selections can take 30 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"On Tuesday on this week my wife and I visited T J . We haven t been to T J for awhile but we missed them. With the meal we had we probably should have forgot them. I ordered my meal and could not wait for the mouth watering goodness. It WAS awful. Micro waved dinner. I could have done it better myself.  I am sorry to say TJ struck out with us. It will be a long time before we return.They also were vacuming the floor right near us while we were eating. They don't seem to know this is a no !no!. That is all  you need is have  vacuum dust flying in the air while your eating."}
{"text":"Great experience at this moderately priced Italian eatery. We had a big group there and the food was superb. Chicken Madison and veal parmigiana were as good as it gets. Fresh, home-made warm bread was terrific. The service was great, and the manager kept checking to see that all was well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just wonderful! Family friendly, reasonably priced, great service and terrific food!!! Pasta is handmade and wonderful."}
{"text":"TJ's is everything you can ask in a local Italian restaurant. Good service and food, including all the classics. My favorite is one of their few original items, Chicken Madison. It's a pounded thin chicken breast, breaded and fried, then covered with scallions, mushrooms, cheese and a white wine-based sauce."}
{"text":"Wow !!!!!!  Unbelievable!!! Am posting this while still at the restaurant. Hubby and I Started out with the stuffed mushrooms and the sausage and pepper appetizers.. EXCELLANT choices !!! Onto the salads and their little garlic breads ( oh my god heaven in a roll ). Dinner was chicken Madison for me and the TJ trio for hubby. The chicken and the lasagna in the trio were sooooo good we shared everything... And kudos to our waitress who never lost her patience with the table next to us .... 
2 women who should never have gone out to eat because they can make the food so much better at home themselves. Next time please do make it at home and let the other patrons enjoy themselves ...."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade pasta and the prices are very reasonable!! We stopped her while we were traveling and the pasta was so good. You very rarely get homemade pasta these days!! I got Alfredo and my husband got marinara and both were delicious. They had a great looking special too but I went with the Alfredo and very glad I did!"}
{"text":"We had TJ's cater our grad party and it was wonderful!!! Our guests were so happy and satisfied! We had chicken cutlets, green beans (outrageously good), rigatoni, meatballs, salad and garlic bread. I would recommend their cater services anytime."}
{"text":"This place has been a Sunday staple for many years. Here are a few suggestions: the Chicken Madison with a side of pasta & aglio olio, the Shrimp Santa Fe, and the Chicken Formaggio. Their spaghetti appears to be made in house, and sometimes it is a bit gummy, so I recommend going with the angel hair pasta. The bread is pretty much addictive if you get a fresh basketful. Be prepared to wait if you drop in on a Friday or Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I have to say I love one of their signature dishes called Chicken Madison! I've eaten here many times over the past 25 years. I always get the same thing so I can only say that what I get is very good. I would have to say one thing negative about them is their salad. It's just iceberg lettuce and a couple onions and olives and it's never changed over the years, but I don't go there for the salad. Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time off of the Uber Eats App. The delivery was within 30 minutes and the food hot considering that it's really cold outside. Generous size portions and food was on point."}
{"text":"Very good food, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to my pasta! 
I usually get the veal parm dinner, and it's always great! Tender veal, lightly breaded, fantastic home made pasta, and the sauce is excellent! 
The rolls and salads are good as well. 
As far as the rest of the dinners go, I've always been happy with them : the meatballs, sausage, chicken parm and even their pizza is top notch. 
The service is generally pretty quick, and the staff is very friendly. 
You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I grew up in this area and when we come back to visit we always make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner at TJ's. This place has been open for as long as I can remember. I even see who I think is the same owner working there forever. My favorite Italian dishes are chicken parmigiana and fettuccine alfredo. The chicken parmigiana is awesome and I get it every time I come here but the alfredo isn't anything special. The garlic rolls that come with the meal are good and all meals come with a salad. We are heading back to Mentor next month and I already told the family we are stopping in for lunch. We look forward to the visit and I can't wait to enjoy the chicken parmigiana!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owners are good people and stand by their food and will fix or replace any problems you have. The bread is amazing. Calzones and pizzas are good. Everything is homemade. The soup and salads are pretty good. My favorite is the Chick Madison. They have a big selection and very fair pricing. The portions are huge. I took half of mine home. Little family place. Not corporate."}
{"text":"This is the best pasta I've found in Northeast Ohio!  It's all homemade!  Friendly staff - we feel very welcomed at TJ's!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Italian food in the area! We love everything we have had here from pizza, to seafood, to chicken and of course pasta dishes! The home made garlic rolls are also served so warm and fresh! Highly recommend chicken Madison, chicken parm and the noodles they make right there. Family friendly, fast service and nice staff."}
{"text":"Such a great little family place. You walk in to happy   Hostess and they have all your Italian classics and then have homemade noodles. The chicken Madison is the best chicken dish I ever had!!! Lots of room for big parties. The salads are covered in cheese. Overall a great place for lunch and lots of specials and great Italian desserts. $-$$"}
{"text":"After a \"whatever you want - I don't care\" debate with my better half, we decide of TJ's and so glad we did! Walked in through a packed parking lot and thought-that's a good sign! Seated right away, we ordered drinks and the TJ's Sampler. It comes with 4 chicken tenders, 5 broccoli and cheddar poppers, 5 stuffed raviolis and maybe 4 provolone cheese sticks. Perfect for sharing with the table. We also were brought a basket of garlic bread - sooo good. I'm a sauce girl so ask for marinara if you don't get the sampler. For dinner, my better half ordered the Taste of TJ's - Chicken Parm, Lasagna and Fettuccine Alfredo. I always offer to share and am briskly turned away. After the apps, I wanted something lighter and ordered the Chicken Pecan Salad. Such a huge portion and a great salad all around. Everything was great! Service was attentive and we never had an empty drinking glass. Minus the crazy 3yr old on his ipad behind us (huge pet peve), we had a great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was very pleasant, attentive, eager to suggest menu items and did a great job. That's why I gave the place a 2, everything else was trash.

Place feels like the run down lovechild of an applebees and Olive garden. Goofy paint job, vendor product promotional posters on the walls, and the outside looks like it hasn't been touched in awhile. The place needs a renovation like no one's business.

That doesn't matter though, it is the food that counts and for a place that calls itself an \"Italian eatery\" it fails to even accomplish microwave dinner quality.

I got a wedding soup which tasted like it was out of the can, the eggplant pram appetizer and a meatball sub. The eggplant tasted like deep fried plastic- it may have even been Tyson frozen patties. The meatball sub was off the shelf hoagie bread, small tasteless meatballs and the same bland sauce that was on the eggplant. The whole thing was then form fitted with four circular slices of provolone that ended up looking like a raincoat. 

I wasn't able to get more then halfway through anything i ordered and brought the rest home for my dogs.  So, friendly service aside this place is a strait up one."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants! Better than Olive Garden! The breadsticks are fantastic and the Chicken Madison is absolutely delicious! I've always had great service and will continue to go here again and again. I've noticed some comments on the appearance of the restaurant. The restaurant has always appeared very clean and presentable. I'm personally not concerned for the decor, as I go here for food and not the decorations. If you haven't been here, it's worth trying!!"}
{"text":"Great food be sure to ensure that you do the call ahead seating before you go seafood is also good in addition to the Italian food. Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this place to have lunch on the suggestion of my boss. I gotta be honest here comma it looks like a Transit bus full of retirees pulled up at noon and proceeded to populate the place. However, I digress. It seems it was probably last decorated in early 2000 and not been touched since. Complete with plastic plants. What bothers me with some restaurants is their blatant disregard for following code and safety of their people. There are extension cords running along the floor boards 2 light up Dusty Christmas lights on a window Valance.  2 mirror some of the other reviews on here, a pasta sauce was Bland and tasteless. The chicken parmesan sandwich as well equally as bad. The chicken patty appeared to be one that you would get when you buy them by the hundreds from a food service company. To get through the bathroom if you must navigate your way through a Labyrinth of a darkened hallway which I have no idea how in the world this is a AdA complaint."}
{"text":"Pretty decent lunch menu.   I went with the lunch portion of the Seafood Alfredo, if it was a \"lunch\" portion, I hate to see the dinner portion.  It was really good home made Alfredo sauce and the chunks of seafood were pretty tasty.  No complaints.  But like I said, lunch portion was huge and probably to heavy for my poor tummy for lunch.   The staff is wonderful and very attentive.  The place had a good business lunch crowd, but the 80's music just killed me......."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way back to Chicago we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. Our waitress savanna was there and had our drink order and drinks in a matter of minutes.  Exceptional service and great food. The menu offered a huge variety and I had veal and my wife had chicken dishes that were very good. They had everything and the desert was exceptional to. All pasta is made there. Owners were great!! Thank you for a wonderful dinner and we will be back"}
{"text":"My husband suggested TJ's because he loves their Italian wedding soup and before his retirement this was a regular with the people at his work.  The parking lot was really crowded which is always a good sign.  We walked in and seated ourselves.  We were quickly greeted by the server (I  think he was also the owner) and our drinks appeared very quickly.  Took me forever to decide what I wanted but opted for the Italian wedding soup and it was as good as my husband had said.  Wonderful  home made rolls and they were so nice and warm.  The butter melted on them.  I ordered seafood alfredo but wanted to swap out the pasta since I really enjoy the thin pasta.  No problem at all.  My husband had a veal parmiagian (I can't spell it) and he loved it. Service was excellent, the food delicious and there was enough to take home for lunch for me the next day. I love this place and we'll be coming back often."}
{"text":"Got the eggplant Parmesan sandwich.  It was good. Not soggy and tasty.  Came with fries, salad, or soup for less than 8 bucks. Other dinners got chicken Parmesan cutlet with spaghetti and broccoli.  Both liked their lunches. Service was great during the busy lunch hour.  Very friendly staff. Smelled great as soon as you walk in of pizza cooking."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say I can only give this a 2 start for the food. If it was the atmosphere- the customer service I would go higher. We had Cindy as our server and there was 9 of us- She didn't miss a beat and was on top of everything in a very busy Saturday lunch. 
My reason for the 2 star. I read the reviews....I asked Cindy and most recommendations came for the shrimp, vegetables on  pasta with an oil garlic sauce. ....Cold pasta noodles- I make my own these were not homemade, vegetables  (right out of a frozen bag) carrots were wavy cut, broccoli was smashed from being over steamed (boiled) cauliflower was grilled (brown on sides) - shrimp was very bland- no garlic taste- I asked for Marinara sauce which came in a cup for tasting- I could of ate that with a spoon- very good and hot. Maybe I would go back - but I would asked for the red sauce. Garlic rolls were hot and buttery= very good."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and noticed that the parking lot was packed on a Friday night for TJ's so I decided to go in and find out for myself how good the Italian eatery was.  I love good Italian food so I was really looking forward to my meal. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauv. w/ veal parmigiana.  The wine was served in a thick very warm glass that must have just come out of the diswasher.  The wine was from Woodbridge, now I know not to buy that brand because it was not very good and I couldn't finish my small glass.  

The rolls were warm and served in the basket upside down.  The salad was ok but I found it very tacky for $15.00 meal to have a salad where the dressing was in a packet that I had to tear open and pour on the salad.  

The veal parmigiana was edible.  The pasta wasn't that great because the noodles were so thick and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can...not even a jar, LOL.  The cheese on the veal was pretty good.  

Overall I think the place is your average hometown, low budget, eatery, a nice gathering place but if you are looking for a decent meal scoot on down to the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, great food and service, have been coming here since I was a child. With that being said, I have noticed the restaurant could use a freshen up, maybe some new carpet and an update on the small booths they have."}
{"text":"Our first visit.  We had Seafood Alfredo & Capellini Supreme. The food was a 4, the staff was a 5. The salads and bread were great.  Kathy was our waitress, she was perfect. From the time you walk in until you leave, your treated like out of town family. Very well run! Reasonably priced, large portions.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"TJ's has been here a long time but its exterior never beckoned me inside, however my wife sons I decided to finally give it a  try and we were presently surprised by the good food. 
Service a little slow to start but it picked up once our waitress zoned it on us, and a sweet and pleasant waitress at that. The place was crowded (Black Friday and its near the mall.) but we got seated right away. Lights were very bright-too bright and ambiance was lacking for sure but the menu was extensive and special requests were happily accommodated. We all ordered something different and all of us agreed it was very good with ample portions."}
{"text":"Excellent as always! The bread is wonderful and never ending :)  The salads that come with your mean are just OK so I would recommend getting the soup instead. Their spaghetti sauce is very good! Plus I love their homemade pasta. Overall I recommend especially over chain places."}
{"text":"Meh. That's how I feel after dinner here tonight. To be fair, this is almost always how I feel about most Italian restaurants... like I could have made it at home myself. 

Went here tonight (Tuesday) at 6:30 pm with a party of 6. Had reservations, but they definitely weren't necessary. I think there were only 6 tables filled at any given time throughout our meal. A few people were coming in and out for take-out meals. 

I had the eggplant Parmesan. Not the best. Not the worst. It was served with a side salad. Iceburg lettuce with a few tomatoes, red onion, cheese, and black olives. Pretty standard. I had the Italian dressing, which is served on the side (lid and all!). The dressing was way to vinegary to me tonight. Left a tang on my tongue (for lack of a better way to describe it). Also served with endless garlic rolls on the table. These are tasty and buttery, but kind of seem like something I could make at home in the oven myself... like those texas toast garlic stick things, but smaller. 

Anyway, the main event, the eggplant, was OK. Just okay. The portion size was ENORMOUS. I think I got an entire eggplant. Came with a side of spaghetti and marinara. House made noodles, per the menu. I'm not sure I would have noticed if the menu didn't say it. The plating made it kind of weird to eat. I had a mound of spaghetti and a whole plate of eggplant. I probably should have asked for a 3rd plate, but really it would be nice if they were both on one bigger plate. Everything was just \"fine\". Again, kind of seemed like something I could have made at home. That being said, if you're looking for a meal with a \"home cooked\" feel to it - this might be your place. My rule is usually that I don't want to pay someone to cook something for me that I think i can easily make myself."}
{"text":"They had delicious and comforting Italian food. The breadsticks were disappointing, but the pasta was delicious! Consider this an alternative to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Yuck. I decided to give Tj's a try since it's close to home. Definitely was underwhelmed and left knowing I would never be back. The bread was ok, salads cheap and disgusting (there's a reason why they're unlimited), and my Eggplant Parmesan absolutely inedible. It was the worst Eggplant Parm that I've ever eaten,ever. Unless you enjoy tasteless and greasy discs that barely resemble eggplant, I would stay away. The homemade pasta that came with the meal was ok;the sauce wasn't very good and the noodles were too thick. I love freshly made pasta (Ohio City-yum!) but it wasn't what I expected. At least I was able to eat some of it after pushing away my eggplant. 

Service was ok. Our server seemed overwhelmed. Our table must have been out of her section,as we felt like an afterthought throughout the meal. I had to ask her about my iced tea while ordering dinner, and we had to ask the busser at a nearby table for cheese.

Decor was tacky and old-fashioned. This restaurant could definitely use a facelift.

Overall,stay away. I love independently owned restaurants, but I would definitely go to Olive Garden before coming back. That's saying a lot."}
{"text":"We usually get good service from this place, but this time we didn't. We ordered to go, so maybe that's why. They messed up the order and completely forgot an item and when we went back inside, we were told it just wasn't ready yet so they didn't give it to us. The manager gave us a free desert for it, but we still had to wait another twenty minutes for it. Food was good for the most part. We did have some burnt food and we found a bone in the chicken."}
{"text":"I needed something quick after work and one of my co-workers suggested this place. 
I was happy to find out that they offered carry-out. I called up there and the girl on the phone was very pleasant. She suggested the lasagna (it was her favorite). 

It was also a nice surprise to find out that all dinners came with a salad and breadsticks!

She said it would be 15 minutes; and it was 15 minutes. I showed up and my food was getting bagged up and it was ready to go. 

The lasagna was good. A really big portion. The breadsticks were soft and fresh baked. The only downside was the salad. A little disappointing. But for $12.99, I can't complain. 

I would definitely try it again, maybe next time for dine-in."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Worst food I have ever had at a restaurant. I got rigatoni with sausage and my husband got the chicken Madison. Neither of us could eat our entrees due to how awful they were. The chicken Madison was greasy and swimming in a buttery sauce and the rigatoni with sausage had the worst sausage I probably have ever tasted. The service was okay and the bread was good, but I have never not been able to finish my food at a restaurant. If you need to find somewhere to eat pick one of the many other places mentor has to offer."}
{"text":"Wow, what an impressive meal! We walked in an I was thinking \"oh great, one of those cheesy Italian restaurants that gets everything out of a can\" but no! Everything was homemade and super flavorful. It's definitely a little dated, but the food was fresh and delicious. We started with an order of calamari, which was served in strips and battered and fried. It was so tender and no at all chewy like calamari sometimes is. I ordered the special, which was sauteed chicken with spinach and garlic in a basil parmesan cream sauce served with homemade spaghetti. It was so good! Nice and creamy without feeling heavy like alfredo sauce. Other people at our table got the veal parmesan, which was thin and crispy fried. The lasagna was also really tasty and very homemade tasting. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a very cosy restaurant. Food is excellent. Fried Calamari is out of this world being so tender. Chicken Tosca and chicken madison are some of my favorite. Homemade pasta and the garlic breadsticks hit the spots. The tomato sauce is very mild and not too acidic.  Great place to go for nice Italian meal."}
{"text":"I always eat at least once a week at Tjs and dine in. Today I picked up food to go because the weather looked like it was going to get bad. I want to give thumbs up to Tjs because the  portion was the same as if I would have eaten at the restaurant and the food tasted just as amazing as it always does. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the garlic bread is one of my favorites! I will order take out again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was bland. Many other better Italian restaurants in the area. 

Went on a Sunday it was very busy and crowded (why I am not sure). Homemade noodles were very dense. Awful marinara sauce. 

The tables were sticky and the whole place looked like it could use a good dusting and scrub down. 

I would encourage you to pass."}
{"text":"We are here a few days ago and everything was excellent especially the calamari. Came back on Sunday afternoon and slow service, mediocre Calamari and wife's utensils had dried food on them. After I finished my meal I noticed dried lettuce on my knife. I'm sure the owners want to know. This was hopefully a one time thing. Will be back again but def check utensils."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess. Waitress was at our table almost immediately. Very friendly as well. Food arrived in a short amount of time and was quite good. I gave 4 stars only because it was a tad on the pricey side. Would go again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Better-than-average Italian food. Can get crowded on the weekends. Highly recommend the Chicken Madison (mushrooms, green onions, covered with cheddar and provolone) and Chicken Formaggio (mushrooms, artichokes, Swiss cheese)."}
