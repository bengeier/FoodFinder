{"text":"Aug 1st 2014 was my first time eating here, and it wont be the last lol. The service was wonderful, friendly and attentive. The food DELITIOUSE! I had a cheese steak, the meat was tender, the cheese melted, the french fries were seasoned and crispy. They have two pool tables and a bar sitting area to watch games. I would recommend this to all my friends who are looking for a good place to chill."}
{"text":"First time there today.  We will definetely go again.  Food was great and service was great.  Great menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place to have a drink and play a little bit of pool.  So we thought we would give this place a try the food is delicious the portion sizes are huge our waitress Felicia was outstanding and  very nice the."}
{"text":"This is blue collar a bar as you can get. Smoky with tasteless decor inadequate amount of TVs and beat up furnishings. The help is great though and accommodating. Hamburger was ok as were the fries. Quantity was plentiful"}
{"text":"I used to go here because it is so close BUT stopped. Well happy I decided to go back. FOOD  is so improved. Huge menu. Prices are very reasonable. The slot machines are loose. Monique and Amy the day time Bartender's are GREAT. Mikey is there at night to take care of the bar and he COOKS too?. This is a great local Bar and Grill."}
{"text":"Food was below average. But good environment & great service. Really cheap. Meal was comped without asking because it took a while to come out"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Bathroom smells like a sewer. Nice staff. Food wasn't great. Fries had the taste of the old grease that's been cooking everything. Burger, recommended by bartender, not great. Not even good. Pickles on the burger tasted weird"}
{"text":"Excellent food (for a bar) great friendly service. Love coming here when I feel like a beer and burger!"}
{"text":"I Love This Bar the people are friendly the food is delicious you need to try this place amazing you can play pool you can listen to music and you be around good customer service televisions Sports news  Lisa always in the house"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good.   My buddy and I stopped in after reading a couple reviews and aside from the smell of stale smoke this place was great.  I had the Hangover Burger with a nice over easy egg on top of a half pound burger. I'd be surprised if this place makes it's own burgers but at least they can cook them right. It was still juicy, warm and had a nice helping of fresh avocado on top. The burger was also bigger than I had expected, a full half pounder.  In my opinion a minor drawback is that they have only 3-4 drafts, all the typical Bud variety. Minor issue.   That being said, my total, including a large (22oz) draft came to just under nine and a half dollars.  I could see myself bringing friends here if I was back in town doing more training."}
{"text":"Great place! ALL the bartenders are fantabulous, machines are great, and the owner has been updating damn near everything! Food prices are good, and the food is great. The pizza is the best in north Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area forever and can recall when this little place opened.  It was exciting to have a restaurant in the area.  After all these years I can say I still feel that same enthusiasm.  Pros:  The food overall is tasty and the menu is much better from what it had been in the past in my opinion.  Prices are rather reasonable even off happy hour.  Service has always been good.  This is an area that can be tricky since it seems the bartender is also in charge of waiting on the tables in the restaurant.  Cons:  The only real con is that this is clearly a bar that has tables for customers who may want to eat,  Originally there was a separation between the bar and the restaurant.  I do not necessarily mind this, but I could see some turned off by it.    I definitely plan on hitting up this spot more often. especially when the NFL comes back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great. Bartenders at night ROCK! It isn't on the menu, but when you have the munchies, order the fresh potato chips with shredded cheese. They are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times before and have always liked the service. Emmy has been my bartender for years so recently I've been frequenting here more often. A great gaming bar with good drinks that are priced right! The food is dynamite too. They have 10 big screen TVs with every sport on. If you're debating on checking this bar out do yourself the favor and come down. It's a great bar with a good vibe and sweet gaming."}
{"text":"I came here for some day drinking never bad idea in life right? Really came too support my friend Heather at her new gig at Northstar Bar & Grill. It tradition for all the years known her always stopped by whatever bar she working at over the years. Service always five stars on Heather day shifts! Honestly she does great job not only because she friend but she makes you feel welcome, never have worry about empty glass in your hand, and she will always find way too brighten ones day.   Talk about all the way out there for me. I felt like drove too Utah and back. All for family. Once you get too Northstar Bar & Grill you would be surprise once you walk in the door. At the core just local dive bar that all about the poker machines or multi games and then little section for the restaurant. I been too lots of local dive bars in Vegas over the years. The thing that like about Nortstar Bar & Grill guess they recently renovated the interior. It feels new not old run down. They have couple pool tables, lots of widescreen all on the inside of the bar (bar rectangle, all widescreen up top, and bar in the middle), and they can change one of the widescreen too your game. Not much seating it comes too the restaurant. I just stopped by for day drinking so never looked at the menu. I would think its your basic bar food nothing exotic but simple everyday sandwiches what not find at most other sports bar/restaurant. The next time visit Heather make sure try some of the menu.    Overall if the place was not on the other side of town or in another state. I would hang out more often. It has nice lay back feeling too the bar. Again like the new feeling every place I look at and not beat the service or the best bartender I know in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thought I would get sliders...and a drink.  I have been here once before with a really nice guy friend...really brings back memories with HIM."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! Not only do they serve delicious breakfast food, but the price is insanely affordable. There is nowhere in town you will get food this delectable at these prices. I love stopping by on Saturday or Sunday mornings to see the bartender/server, Emmy. She is awesome. She is friendly, helpful and remembers your orders and preferences. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Their new menu is amazing, compliments to the chef! Great local spot for awesome food! So far have had lunch and dinner, next breakfast. Prices are so reasonable"}
{"text":"Been here 6 or 7 times in the last year.... food is typically good, great prices, service is hit-or-miss.  Sign out front says \"best wings, try today\", so thought I'd order the wings today... I only like flats, asked if I cud get just flats.....nope! Can't do it! Plus the lady that has been here forever is kinda rude, but that's to be expected from someone that has worked at a \"neighbourhood\" bar for a long time and we aren't \"regulars\" which she seems kinder too. My husband used the perfect word for her, abrasive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   The service...the menu...the prices...WOW!!! We now have a favorite local! Can't wait to come and try some of the draft beers and apps!"}
{"text":"Great place,Food is exceptional  Justin the bartender makes awesome drinks Everyone is very nice there great service they go out of there way to make sure you are happy with everything.  Has several in bar poker machines and 2 pool tables"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for breakfast! Excellent service and prices. Will definitely come back! Looking forward to trying their lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"Awesome!  I had the patty melt med rare. The best melt I have ever had. The wife had the philly and loved it. Great food, friendly staff. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great local no fuss bar! I was in the other night and Bernie was my bartender, really friendly and accommodating. We showed up around 10 on a Friday night and it was super busy! We luckily found 2 open machines on the bar. We didn't have anything to eat but I appreciated he atmosphere and service. A pretty nice place to head if you live on this side of town, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to go have a drink and/or an awesome meal.  Anytime I go to north star I always receive the best service!!!!! The workers there are very pleasant and always make me feel welcome anytime and any day.  They're food is great and their drink prices are very reasonable and they have my favorite games to play or if I'm not in the mood to gamble then I love to partake in a nice game of pool.  Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in and was greeted with a warm welcome from Emmy. She told me about the steak special, and it was great! Thank you, Emmy for giving me a good experience at the North star bar and grill."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of the very few times that I am going to 5 star a place that isn't a five star restaurant.  This is a cheers type of bar, they are great with their comps, the entire staff always has a great attitude.   The food, for bar food it is great, some things are frozen and just fried but over all it is great. Some highlights are.   The pizza and calzones, simple fresh and very good.   The burgers, for a burger you just can't really ask for more.   My favorite is the patty melt or the north star calzone. Depending on what kind of mood I am in."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast spot 5.99 classic breakfast and they always remember what I ordered and what I like"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning!  This bar is walking distance from home, their new menu includes a fabulous selection for inexpensive breakfasts!   My hubby and both had the \"brothers\" breakfast for $3.99!!!.....he ordered pancakes, sausage and eggs, I ordered French toast, bacon, and eggs!   I have to say......THIS FRENCH TOAST IS THE VERY BEST I HAVE EVER HAD IN A RESTAURANT!   wow, kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"Food is fabulous. My favorite is the Mushroom Express Chicken Sandwich. I rarely go because I can't stand the smoky atmosphere. Too bad they don't GrubHub or deliver."}
{"text":"Happened upon this gem for breakfast! Very much a country bar atmosphere with low lighting, a large bar in the middle and booths around the edges.  I had no idea what to expect when I ordered the breakfast burrito from our charming, sweet and wonderfully attentive waitress.   I was stunned at what arrived! A delicious, tightly packed burrito of egg, sausage, cheese etc. expertly cooked and served with fresh cooked, non greasy country potatoes and a sprinkling of dried parsley around the plate edge! This was gourmet fair and gourmet presentation! The most stunning thing...it was $4.99! This is a gem! I'm going back tomorrow!!!  Only thing is, of course there are smokers..which I'm not used to...coming from LA"}
{"text":"I'd give them more stars if they had a smoke free dining area. Other than that , the portions are fair for the price. We've only had breakfast from there. I just learned to call in my order and just pick it up. The girl who runs the front of the house is so nice and friendly. I like her personality she makes you feel like family, like one of those loving aunts. The bacon and sausage was slightly too salty but that comes with the nature of breakfast meat. For 4.99. I can't really complain."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good Calzone. Should have passed on this place! Ordered a ham and cheese calzone. One thin slice deli ham, maybe a half a slice. A little mozzarella and NO ricotta. Horrible! Very very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok I went on a whim this morning.... I woke up and saw an advertisement for North Star Bar & Grill which I have seen in my neighborhood several times and always wondered about. The advertisement said 12 breakfast plates under $5 *light bulb* I'm quickly up & out the door! Immediately after arriving I'm greeted by Monique. She was very friendly and personable. I ordered an iced tea and decided on the breakfast burrito. It was a large tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, onions, peppers, and cheddar cheese. It came with home fries which are like O'Brian style potatoes with peppers and onions. There is also a side of homemade salsa all that for $3.99... I added a side of sausage for $1.99 and everything was so delicious. This is honestly the best breakfast I've had in a long time and it's comprable to what you will pay at McDonald's for cold food.... I highly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC BURGERS!! I was getting my car worked on next door at AA auto.. wanted to kill time. stopped in to get a bite to eat. YAY IM A FAN!! I am going there right now to get food to go"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up from this place since it's close to where I work. The food was AWESOME! I ordered the fish & chips and they were amazing! Not too much batter and the fries were good too! They also have this house sauce, similar to Cane's sauce, and it was really yummy! My co worker got the Mediterranean salad that was really good too. She also ordered a soup but that was a downfall since the soup was literally half of the styrofoam cup- MAJOR BUMMER! But other than that the food tasted great and it was ready when my co worker arrived to pick it up. Will definiely try this place in person next time!"}
{"text":"Love the new menu -- and especially the new breakfast selections.  They have 12 breakfast dishes for under $5.  We had eggs, bacon (or sausage), breakfast potatoes and toast - $3.99!!!  The lunch, dinner and appetizer menus have also been updated -- will be going back very soon to try some of the other new additions to the menu.  The new menu takes the North Star to a whole new level!"}
{"text":"Our home away from home... Great atmosphere but very smoky. The food is great and the price is right. The staff is fantastic and they really make us feel at home. It's our neighborhood place..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new local bar to grab a drink and some food.   We are pleased. With our choice. The menu has the majority of typical bar food and the prices are very reasonable.   But they do offer healthier choices as well.  They advertise and claim to make their own sauces daily. Although we didn't try any I can say the onion rings were hand breaded and very good.  We plan on returning for breakfast soon. They offer several breakfast items under $5  The only complaint is that the bar has a smoky smell and a smell of something trying to cover up the smoke"}
{"text":"This is the epitome of the classic, neighborhood bar in Las Vegas.  And that's a good thing!  This place has great drinks, great food, and great bartenders!  The trifecta of awesomeness compressed into a corner, barely containing itself like a barrel of monkeys... on meth... on a rapid river... of liquid, hot, magma.  First, the food.  Their cook is freakin' awesome.  From thick, delicious pizzas to juicy stack burgers to saucy pot stickers to the most amazing wings... ever... in the history... of everything.  Second, the drinks.  They're good, I suppose... if you like full on, non-watered down liquor of the gods!  Seriously though, they are strong, and they do not skimp.  I love a Black Russian (simply vodka and Kahlua), but most places put about three shots of it (total) into a tiny tumbler that looks about 1/3 full.  Nope, not hear.  Now realistically, it's not like they pour that kinda drink in a carafe, or tall glass, but it's a hefty tumbler that is full.  And they know their stuff... and if they don't know, they'll look it up.  They being the awesome bartenders, which brings me to the last bit.  Third, the bartenders extraordinaire.  Now, I only know of the two we always see on Friday, Justin and Jason, but... they're freakin' awesome.  They're quick with a smile, a joke and greeting, and even quicker with the drinks.  What I really like to say though is they are A-#1 with customer service.  They take care of you if you're there to have a good time, and they don't tolerate people who are asses or bringing down everyone else with their piss poor attitudes.  They are some top notch, keep the vibe groovin' kinda guys.  All in all, despite all the jokes and overbearing peppiness from up above, this really is a great bar.  All walks of life, as you'll be listening to country, which will kick into R&B, which will kick into 80's, which will kick into alternative, rap, metal... and everyone always seems to get along (again, the bartenders don't mess around if you end up being a dick).  Even if you don't drink, I still highly recommend stopping in for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Stinks off smoke, bad waitress service, average to poor food.  This is a dive bar without any off the virtues of a dive bar."}
{"text":"North Star has been falling steadily. Some nights their kitchen isn't open...hello NBA finals night. Messed up orders, under cooked food, greasy old oily fries."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday breakfast with my dad and my wife. Wife and I both had the breakfast sandwich, which was a good size, and fairly tasty. It would have benefitted from some type of sauce, though. Dad had an omelette, which came with hash browns and marble rye; he said it was good. I also had a bloody mary which was decidedly tasty, and came in a pint glass; score!  Our waitress, Rebecca, was funny. When she brought the check and I grabbed it just before my dad could snatch it up, Rebecca told him that it was because he was old and had eaten too much. Oh, did we all get a good laugh out of that! Well, everyone except dad."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetarian calzone and it was huge! It was the size of small pizza pie! The bread texture sucked though. It was very doughy and dry. The stuffing should've been good with the amount of cheese I chose but it wasn't. It was so bland. The marina sauce on the side didn't help it either."}
{"text":"Been going to this place off and on for about 15 years and have been completely satisfied with the food,  drink and service.  Every time. Will continue to go here  off and on for the next 15 years."}
{"text":"One thing is GREAT here... the patty melt burger, should be voted best in Las Vegas.  The next best thing is their chicken quesadilla, this aint your average quesadilla, this baby is piled high with chicken & cheese, tomatoes and spices, on a crunchy tortilla , this sets a new standard for restaurants to follow.  Bar food, wings and things are pretty average, but the two items mentioned will be worth your time."}
{"text":"*** Review #600 ***  On my one outing here thus far I enjoyed excellent spongy Egg Rolls with a very fruity Sweet & Sour Sauce and Hot Mustard Sauce, followed by a very good bowl of silky Tomato Soup.  Potato Skins with Cheddar Cheese and bacon were also very good, and Fried Mozzarella Sticks excellent.  For my main course I enjoyed a moist North Star Club with avocado on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread and good Krinkle Cut Fries.  The only error of the night was the chef's.  The avocado on my club sandwich was forgotten and served instead to another diner as part of a Cobb Salad.  At least someone at my table got it!"}
{"text":"Cheap quality food. Don't expect much. Coffee sucks. Toast is hard as croutons and served dry."}
