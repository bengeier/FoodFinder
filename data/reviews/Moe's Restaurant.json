{"text":"Some of the more interesting food that you will get in the falls.  The chefs put a lot of care into their craft and it is evident in the quality of the food that you get."}
{"text":"I might not go on living if Moe ever takes the short rib sliders off her menu. Yes, they're that good....like Last Supper good. But every other dish is equally rockin'.  Moe's has been a favorite for years, and the kitchen never loses its love of cooking. Great martinis, too-- and best sipped while having a chat with the amiable owner, Moe."}
{"text":"I stop here occasionally for lunch while my car is being serviced at Lambert Buick/GMC The food here never disappoints. Today I had the Moe Betta Chicken sandwich with fresh cut chips. The sandwich was delightful and I was disappointed when I was finished, as I wanted to keep eating it!  The prices are very reasonable and the service is very good as well. A definite place to stop for a nice lunch or dinner!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great bread pudding ever!!!  Became familiar with the restaurant at the taste of Akron, returned to this event looking for Moe's.  Visited the restaurant with my son we had a grilled chicken sandwich, Caesar salad and of course the bread pudding.  Great food and atmosphere :-)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Moe's Restaurant. Everytime I am near the Kent area, I have to make a stop there. The food is phenomenal along with great service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just spent $60. For a very boring meal! Calamari was rubbery and the bowl was filled up with a large piece of bread in the bottom!  Boyfriend Caesar was mostly parmesan cheese and mine was a bland salad. Entering and leaving restaurant bombarded with many smokers at the door smoking. Used to love this place wont be back!!"}
{"text":"Fun place!  Sat on the bar side (at the bar) and had great conversations with regulars and non-regulars.  They have so many different bottled beers and after a long week, I wasn't capable of making any decisions so I asked for IPA of the bartender's choosing.  She didn't bat an eye at that and brought out one that they'd just gotten in and was a good choice.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and available without being intrusive.  The bartenders know what's going on, how long the wait for a bar seat might be, and know the regulars by name.  For dinner, shared homemade tator tots and chicken tacos for appetizers - tator tots were great, but the corn tortilla on the chicken taco was too undercooked to eat (filling was good, though).  Dinner was Moe betta burger with regular fries, both good.    The bar side, at least, isn't the place to bring the kids - it's loud, busy, too pricey, and generally doesn't have backup kid-friendly food as a safety valve.  Leave them with Grandma and enjoy a night out."}
{"text":"Overall, I love Moe's.  I'd like to give 4.5, but for some reason yelp is all about integers.  Moe is a smart business woman, the chefs are good at what they do,  the (evening) bartenders are friendly, intelligent, and very good at mixing most common drinks, and (with some exceptions) most of the wait staff are good.  When they get busy they get swamped and, yes, service can suffer a bit, but that's the result of the bar having a large and loyal group of patrons.  Drink prices are a bit above normal, but the, the service and atmosphere warrant it, so the value is still quite good.  Food is not as good.  Don't get me wrong, I mean it when I say the chefs are good, but the prices are much higher than normal so that value is just not as good on this side.  (Also the number of mouse traps and the \"slightly off\" smells in and around closed areas makes me wonder if mice are a problem... )  Service, atmosphere, and drinks are all 5s, but the food is 3.5 or 4. Accordingly, I think 4.5 or 4 stars is fair."}
{"text":"Nice little gem in C-Falls. The staff was extremely friendly. The menu is overhauled monthly, keeping it local and fresh. Great beers (bottles only)."}
{"text":"Moe's is expensive.  I'll say that right away.  Given that, it is a nice spot in the Falls.  The menu changes monthly and you can really see all the time and effort put into the dishes.  The foot was excellent.  My boyfriend's beef tenderloin literally fell off the bone.  The martinis are overpriced and very strong.  It's a small joint - so make a reservation.  I would definitely recommend this for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Moe's is trying to hard. This is Cuyahoga Falls not San Francisco. A simple steak with common sides would be appreciated. It's a simple bar with and eclectic menu. They don't fit. My \"Caesar Salad\" was no more than lettuce with mayo on top, bland and creamy. No hit of garlic, spice or anchovy (not even artificially flavored anchovie!). Good thing I had Grilled Salmon on the side, which was prepared superbly. Still hungry I ordered their signature burger, no bun to avoid the extra carbs. I really doubt it was angus a d advertised. But in any event at least it was bar food as you'd expect. Hey Moe, lets keep it simple and do it right, the fancy stuff simply points out that you can't do fancy."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. From the food to the waitress. The waitress was so helpful and excited about the food you would have that she was the one cooking it. I ordered the salmon and it was unbelievable . The stuffed banana peppers were perfect . This place is well worth the pricey menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Moe's at least the last two to three years or longer whenever I walk in Becca always  says hello she always has a great smile and she knows exactly what I want to order   The April menu will knock your shoes off"}
{"text":"Friday night no reservation full house... and service couldn't have been more accommodating!! Caesar so ubiquitous anymore but what a great spin. pancetta and hard boiled egg. dressing light perfect. want pork tenderloin where the cooks know a real medium and aren't afraid to under rather than over cook? check. confit? awesome. and... server couldnt have been 20 yrs old but had the swagger of a kid off the floor of Momofuku. in Akron. Really?? win!"}
{"text":"Pricey but well worth it. I had the lamb chops and they melted in my mouth. Nice bar to hang out in with friends."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had heard good things and decided to check it out. The lunch menu was mainly salads and sandwiches but was still pretty deep. We tried the stuffed mushroom and the oysters for apps and they were both amazing.  For lunch I got the Moe Betta Burger and it was really good (although over cooked from how I ordered it). My girlfriend had the beet salad and it was very good except rather small. Overall the food was good ut it was a bit expensive for what you got."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Moe's and will most certainly be my last.  We were seated promptly for our 7pm reservation and we were immediately greeted by our server who was completely obnoxious and overly confident. He set the tone for a horrible meal. He made bad jokes,  embarrassed my friend when she asked a question about the menu, and provided slow, terrible service.   We had to flag our server down 3 times to ask him if we could order appetizers, drinks and entrees. He made excuses each time as to why he hadn't taken better care of our table, blaming the kitchen for slow food preparation, but then forgot to bring beverages and bread several different times.   At 8:45, an hour and 45 minutes after we had sat down at our table, I got up and spoke to the manager. Our entrees (we all ordered sandwiches) had not yet arrived and I am fully convinced it was due to the incompetence of our server.   The food was decent---certainly no where near good enough for it to compensate for the terribly slow service. I will not ever return to this place, and I'll encourage my friends to never return either."}
{"text":"A local favorite.  Unpretentious, amazing food and friendly staff.  Definitely try the rack of lab!"}
{"text":"Before coming here  we read the reviews and were excited about the experience. That was the last time we were excited throughout our time dining here. Upon arrival not a single server was in the tavern. We waiting about ten minutes to be seated. Finally the bartender came out and seated us. We waited to order about another ten minutes. Our order was finally taken. The appetizer of the tater tots was good. However our burger was over cooked, our sweet potato fries were cold, and the side of ranch came after we were done eating. She also never came around to check on the meal.  Overall, we would not recommend this establishment. Food was disappointing as was the lack of service."}
{"text":"We've been here twice in the past year, both times dining on the \"bar\" side.  The menu is interesting, with an effort toward local/seasonal fare.  It is a bit pricey, but not outrageously so.  I wish I could remember exactly what we've ordered, but it was all delicious and well-prepared.  The portions are reasonable, not overly large or small.  The bar itself, however, is kind of a disappointment - a poor selection of beers, a limited wine list, and very standard liquor selection.  It's ok, but it's not special.  The bartender who served us the second time was friendly enough, but mildly insulted my husband (unintentionally, but still) for requesting a dark beer other than Guinness (Guinness is their only dark), told me that she couldn't think of a drink that would be both seasonal and fruity, and implied that she was only refilling my husband's coffee at the end of our meal because it was \"she was going that way anyway.\"  So... sometimes the service just doesn't match.  But overall it's a fine place that we've enjoyed, and I'm sure we'll be back"}
{"text":"I received a free gift card from Moe's for donating to WKSU a local NPR station, when I received it I immediately thought that I'd give it a try. Went to Moe's by myself for a quiet night to relax, the waitress arrived promptly with my menu, being unsure what to try I took a few minuets to look it over. When she returned I asked for her recommendations, after giving me them I choose the homemade tater-tots, wedge salad, and the chicken tortellini special. The tots were hot and delicious, the sauce that arrived  with it complimented them perfectly, although it arrives in excess. The salad was fragrant and fresh, with a glorious homemade dressing and I mean from scratch. I highly recommend it. The chicken special had me delighted, fresh ingredients and beautiful plating. I high recommend Moe's Restaurant to any one looking for a date night spot maybe you'll see me there because I know I'll be returning."}
{"text":"The beef tenderloin was cooked to medium rare, as  was my request.  The result was simply delicious.  The portion size was large and the price reasonable. The service was bar none.  My daughter was coloring  and noticed that she was missing a brown crayon. The maître d' heard this and found one for her. The staff was exceptional, made good recommendations for wine/food pairings, and left our family very happy we chose to come to Moe's."}
{"text":"Nice club like atmosphere, best meal in Cuyahoga Falls by far and excellent service."}
{"text":"We come to Moes whenever we can. No matter how long it has been between our visits, we are always greeted by friendly staff that make us feel right At home. Drinks are great, i do love a good martini! Prices are what you would expect for a good mArtini. Whether you eat on the sandwich side or the dinner side of the menu, we have always been satisfied with our meals. I for one, still love the great breads they serve, and the wonderful mixed green salad, all included in the price of the dinner. Service has always been personable and quick. We recommend Moes to people all of the time."}
{"text":"They have the best Italian sub I've ever had!  We just started going here for lunch a few weeks ago and we are definitely going to go back.  My only complaint is that there seems to be only one waitress/bartender working the bar side, so she is pulled in every direction which makes service kind of slow. This is no fault of the waitress but of management. The decor hasn't been changed in over 10 years, but its muted and very clean so it works for the place."}
{"text":"Moe's loaded Tater Tots are the best thing on the menu. The beer selection is by far the best in the county. Ted is the best bartender around and will guide you to the best beer and food the restaurant has to offer"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Moe's and we will definitely be back.  Great service and amazing food and atmosphere!!  We highly recommend the tater tot appetizer and the creme brulee!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting and freshest food I have ever eaten.  Moe is a phenomenal cook, the atmosphere is either casual or fine dining, and the wait staff are all awesome.  I highly recommend this place for a treat or a nice way to relax after a hard day."}
{"text":"We went here before graduation. We informed them that we were in a hurry and they took that into consideration! Our food came out very quick, hot and tasty! I got the scallops with risotto cake and crab meat coleslaw. It was excellent! There were 12 of us and everyone really enjoyed their food. It is a bit pricy but we thought it was all worth it. This was our first time here and we will definitely be back! It"}
{"text":"Moe's helped us out by catering our wedding...that was one of the best ideas I've had in a long time.  They don't have a catering menu because Moe actually takes the time to sit down with you and creates a custom one on the spot for you.  The food was fantastic, very reasonably priced, service was top notch, and now I have a freezer full of left overs!    I will say this, her pierogies rocked my world.  But now, I have had repeated dreams about the butternut squash ravioli."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner there Wednesday night. I have been there 3-4 times over the last couple years and everything was really good. I wish I could say the same for this trip. Service was not at all friendly. Both the hostess and server seemed uninterested. Not overly nasty or anything like that but they made it seem as though they really didn't care that we were there at all.   Food was ok. A couple apps were good but the main course was a bit over the top as if they just tried to do too much.   In the end we walked out about 2 hours after we had arrived. We basically had to beg for the bill to get out at that time. All of us had the same opinion: the food and experience were not worth the marathon dinner experience."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? The food is exceptional, the staff overly accommodating( ask for Ryan , he will get you sorted proper) this place makes the best pork loin I have ever tasted! Menu is seasonal to include local farms and the like, which is always appreciated by a foodie Their cocktails will get you where you need to be , so careful with ordering the spirits. Makes a great place for date night or a dinner with a somewhat well behaved six year old"}
{"text":"WOW.  Great food and awesome service.  My boyfriend made reservations and let them know ahead of time we would need to be in and out to make a concert at Blossom.  They were more than accommodating and helped steer us in the direction of what to order/ not order to be in and out within an hour.  The short ribs and mashed sheet potatoes were divine.  My boyfriend's beef tenderloin was delicious and you could have cut it with a spoon.  The beet carpaccio was good, not great.  His wedge salad was awesome.  Wine list is small but has good choices.  The interior decor is very simple, maybe a bit too austere.  But the food more than makes up for it.  Make a reservation.  This place gets busy.  Among all the car dealerships it can be a bit difficult to find so just look for a brick building.  We tipped our server 25%.  Yes, he was that good!"}
{"text":"We had Moe cater a wedding for us because we love her food so much. Unbelievable.  Off the Charts.  Home Run!!!    Appetizers were awesome: Sausage Meatballs, Huge Shrimp, Salmon Crostini and Mini Quiches.    For Dinner: Prime Rib that cut like butter.  Duck Confit - I'm still drooling....somebody please wipe off my chin!    People will be talking about this one for years....  BRAVO!  Same food at the restaurant, but you need to be patient. Good things take time to prepare."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate it higher because there is NOWHERE to go for good, non-chain food in the area... but I realized in the grand scheme of all restaurants... it's just OK. I think if the food were cheaper I would rate it a lot higher -- but small portions with a hefty price resulted in both my husband and I both saying \"eh... probably never again\". With the wait, the crowdedness (due to space, not the amount of people), the small amount of food, and the price it just didn't seem like anything special. Worth a try if you're bored? Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing or went on the wrong night, but I'm thinking probably not."}
{"text":"As a preface to this review - I rarely review restaurants when I have a poor experience.  So, where do I start?  My party reserved a table for 15 (+2 high chairs).  We arrived from our hotel after a short half mile walk.  We were greeted by the maitre d' and led to our table in the room adjacent to the bar.  The table was three square 4 seat dining tables conjugated.  As we sat at our seats, we had an issue fitting everyone at the table.  Approximately 1\" between elbows, and the corners of each end were utilized as eating space.  Understandable for a small room during a busy weekend, but still irritating.  We asked if they could accommodate us with additional surface area, but to our disappointment, we must've confused the staff and they brought out an additional chair, which we did not need.  We also notified the staff that one of our highchairs had a broken strap, and knew this would not be suitable for one of the toddlers.  This situation was not rectified, and we were left dealing with this.  Our waiter greeted us with a friendly smile and took our drink order.  Our large party was enjoying the evening, even though we were at the end of a long day and were trying to entertain two tired toddlers.  Our drinks came after a small wait, and we ordered our appetizers and main courses.  We continued the evening in our cramped space, making the best out of the night as we always do.  This is where the trouble started.  To make the issues more concise I'll just bullet point them.  - Took 45 minutes for bread to arrive - Our food arrived approximately 2 hours after we arrived - Mother had to ask for appetizer (1 hour after we ordered) - One of the kid's meals never arrived, we had to ask for them to bring it out.  We ended up telling the staff we didn't want it.  Ended up sharing one of the kid's meals - Pasta was undercooked, and not edible - One of the meals the staff brought out the wrong fries (regular rather than sweet potato) - Brought out half of the parties dinners, and 15 minutes later brought out the rest - Talked to the waiter about the poor staff.  The waiter let us know the manager wasn't there.  Gave mother the phone number letting us know the manager was expecting our call.  The manager never picked up.  Mother left a message and has yet to receive a phone call - To try to \"resolve\" the situation, another waiter named \"Stan\" told us, in a nutshell, that the poor service we received wasn't their problem, that it was our problem  Finally, to end our night, one of the locals (we assume) - under their breath - called us assholes because we weren't going to stand for such a sub-par experience.  My brother in law took exception and called them out.  The chefs and wait staff escorted us out of the restaurant like we weren't patrons and didn't matter.  It's unfortunate, because my mother, father, and sister had a great experience a few weeks ago when they visited, and decided it would be a good place to celebrate her graduation.  To anyone considering booking here for any reason, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"This place has adequately good food but from our weekend lunch perspective, they never have enough help available. Today we left after waiting more than an hour four lunch after we had ordered. They did comp our bar bill for the inconvenience but we were very hungry by the time we left and had to wait again at a nearby restaurant. Feel sorry always for the bartender who is flying around to take care of the entire room. Menu has not changed in ages. Have been coming here for lunch for a long time but probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Perfect service, perfect martini... great food as well!  They made us very welcome, the place is family friendly and the Maître d' was helpful from the phone call to the table, making sure that we were comfortable and welcome.  Warm bread, food cooked to order, hearty and flavorful. Everyone enjoyed their meal.Thank you for the excellent experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first dining experience at Moe's. The food was excellent and definitely upscale but not pretentious. They have a very well defined list wines and beers including many of your favorites and some unusual craft beers. The wait staff is attentive, polite and professional. The only negative item I can comment on is the acoustics. It's was a Friday night but unless you are proficient at lip reading I wouldn't count on having a conversation. I will however recommend EVERYTHING else. I'm looking forward to dining there again during the week. Perhaps I'll be able to hear my companion next time."}
{"text":"Moe's is very busy, make sure you get a reservation! Our food was delicious and the servers were very attentive and friendly. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I went here for my Birthday. There was nothing particulary exciting. The food was good to be honest, but, EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality and atmosphere. You almost pay like a chic restaurant in a big city, but it is technically a tiny little bar next to the highway and car dealers. The menu had grease splash on it. Anyway, ok for one time if you don't care paying almost 60 bucks per person."}
{"text":"5 Stars for:  1. Chocolate covered pretzel martini 2. Dollar shrimp on Thursdays and they are huge!  3. Rotating menu 4. Delicious food that is made from scratch   Missing 1 star for: service. It was slow for a pretty slow night. Took forever for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Moe's is a nice place with good wine selections !! Atmosphere is cosy and friendly. Food is great !! Everyone is very nice. Will most definitely recommend this place !!   Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"I adore this place! I always have the hardest time picking out something to eat because every single thing on the menu sounds like it's to die for. Never been disappointed. This is truly an amazing hidden gem."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on giving this place a 2 star, because the service deserves zero stars and sadly, the food should get 4 stars.    I was afraid to eat here after making reservations.  After multiple attempts at calling in the middle of the day and being hung up  (someone would just answer the phone and immediately hang it up), I finally got through and a young woman put me on hold to check the reservation book.  I sat on hold for almost 5 minutes.  Then a different woman picked up and made it clear to me that she was busy and had other things to do.  I was able to make the reservation, but was worried.  We sat on the dining room side on a Saturday night.  We were not escorted to our table like a normal restaurant.  Instead the hostess informed us, with a finger point, that our table was over there.  We sat for a good 10 minutes before someone came by to ask us for our drink order.  By the way, no menu, so we had no idea what there was.  My chardonnay tasted like barefoot that you can buy at Target for $7 for a bottle.  My glass was $9.  Then the check came, $82 for two meals and one drink each.  Wowzer.  The food - it was delicious.  I only ate half of mine and asked for it to go.  They never brought my take home bag out to me.  I saw several others get their take home bags.  bummer, but we were sick of waiting.    In our time sitting in the dining room, it was very apparent that the floor is mismanaged.  It seems to be a theme in other reviews as well.  Sadly, I won't be back until I hear that the service has improved.  I've had better service at Panera.  Maybe the tavern side is better, but I'm not interested in finding out.  Very disappointing since it was highly recommended to me by Summit county lifers."}
{"text":"After reading few reviews...we decided to hit up this little place called Moe's.   I have driven past this unassuming brick building over and over before ever realizing there was a restaurant inside! Ordered a few raw oysters and a tomato and spinach stuffed Portabella mushroom for appetizers. My lunch guest said it (the mushroom app)  was the \"best appetizer I've ordered anywhere ever'. The oysters were fresh and topped with chilis and lime. Sooo good.   For the heart of the lunch we ordered the \"Moe betta burger\" (for him) and the Beet salad (with goat cheese instead of bleu cheese) for myself. While the service was a tad on the slow side, the food was excellent!!! The server was very accommodating when I requested the goat in lieu of the bleu cheese that was preferred on the menu item and also when my date requested his burger sans bun.   Lunch has been conquered and I'm excited to give dinner a try some evening soon!  Certainly worthy of a recommendation to friends (and even enemies)"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, the meal was prepared perfectly. I ordered the beet salad (fantastic) and the tenderloin. Everything was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I brought my mother here for lunch on the recommendation of a colleague. We couldn't have been more impressed. The server was genuine and friendly, and her suggestions for dining were well-informed - it was obvious she had actually tried the items she was endorsing. Our meals were expertly prepared, and anything we couldn't finish was neatly packaged up by our server.   Excellent experience. I look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"Had a dinner with a business associate last week at Moe's it was AWESOME.  We came in through the bar and were promptly greeted by Ted the Bartender.  We had a reservations he walked us over to the restaurant side.  We chatted with Ted while we were walking and decided to eat our dinner at the bar and hang out with Ted (we renamed him Moe, until Moe came by).  The menu is fabulous and we had a hard time deciding.  We started with the Tater Tots  and Fresh Chips on the recommendation of Ted.  Moe brought out our appetizers and she is a delightful lady.  We talked about the menu and finally were able to order.  We had the Filet and the Walleye.  FABULOUS is the understatement of the day.  Then Moe recommended the Peanut Butter Pie, again off the charts.  I love my deserts and always eat up.  It was decadent and I could not eat the whole piece, which worked out good made for a great breakfast!  It was a great evening, loved sitting at the bar talking to Moe and Ted and the whole crew at Moe's.  Thanks for a great night, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and very accommodating. We never felt rushed. The restaurant is a little small but we went early and avoided the crowd. Would recommend this to anyone that wants a nice dining experience"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night to celebrate 2 family birthdays. The service was excellent and candles on the dessert was a nice touch. The lamb was fantastic, and so was the presentation, however the risotto (very creamy) was bland (on all the plates that had risotto as a side) and needed seasoning and salt. I think something had gotten left out of the risotto or the chef forgot to taste it before sending out of the kitchen. I have had it in the past and was delicious so not sure what happened. The scallops, steelhead trout, pork chops and short ribs were delicious, we would order any of those meals a second time. The lobster in the pierogi appetizer and in the scallops was rubbery and way over cooked. I would avoid ordering a dish that contains lobster here. The mushroom ravioli appetizer and the homemade chips are not to be missed! The ambience is nice but the room could use some sound diffusers to help keep the volume down. We will visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"There are truly great restaurants and then there is Moe's... Everything is made in house, and that includes the soup, which after 13 times dining in to in the past 2 years I have debated everytime asking for the recipe. The menu is monthly, and every month there is something new and amazing with a combination that you would never think of, yet somehow works, such as cranberry in your risotto. I went twice to get the hanger steak just this month as it was done perfectly both times over bacon mashed potatoes. If you are in the area, traveling to the area, or an hour nearby, you need to try Moe's, it's the best of the Akron/Falls/NE Ohio area by a mile"}
{"text":"Moe's has been a hidden treasure in Cuyahoga Falls for many years!  The historic building and soft interiors lull one into a state of bliss that can only be replicated by a good night's sleep.  My family and I have dined here numerous times over the last 20 years.  The restaurant occupies two side-by-side spaces.  One side is the bar area and the other is the restaurant area.  The bar area has lovely booths and stand-alone tables along with a long bar (seating for at least 15).  The restaurant side is beautiful and only seats tables.  If you want a booth you should reserve one of the three precious spots on the bar side.  Chalk-board wine and beer lists grace the walls of the restaurant.  The monthly menu is also showcased via chalkboard - replete with prices.  Moe's will satisfy every whim and will bend over backwards to accommodate patrons who have special dietary needs.  The restaurant prides itself on a varied selection of vegetarian and meat-lovers' meals.  Lamb, fish, shellfish, vegetable, chicken, duck, pork and pasta grace the monthly menus.  Sides incuding such delicacies as pommegranate, red pear, squash, risotto, brie, asparagus and pumpkin are sprinkled throughout the offerings.  I have always had good steaks and fish here!  I always order my steaks and lamb racks \"extra rare\" - they are perfect!  The risotto is to die for.  The desserts are killer!  The owner is present nearly everyday!  She oversees all of the catering, weddings and business meetings that are scheduled daily.  A day does not go by that you won't see her in the restaurant.   I love that Moe's has always been an edgy, fresh, new concept that I can impress my clients with.  I love that Moe's continues to hold the family tradition of my grandparents.  I love that Moe's is maintaining a special place in our community.  Please stop by Moe's if you are in the Cuyahoga Falls area, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Moe's has Incredible food, and great service as well. Also a great place to go and get a cocktail or glass of wine if you aren't hungry. The bar staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is extremely inviting. Also, if you are ever hosting an event or party, they cater and the food is phenominal as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but it took 15 minutes to get a cocktail that I had ordered before dinner.  Our waiter knew I was disappointed and treaded lightly the rest of the night.  Really, with how pricey and upscale the restaurant is, why wouldn't management train better?  My friend who I was with has eaten here countless times, and it was my first time.  I doubt I'll go back because of how he was."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in the area. Have been many times with family & friends, and have never been disappointed! Generous portions as always, and their seasonal entrees are always stunning. My mother always get their version of scallops and says they're the best she's ever had! I've had salmon and chicken entrees before also, and have been happy every single time. I will always return to Moe's for special occasions :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food , and service .   Will return it's a great place. But they like reservations"}
{"text":"We went to Moes for our 39th anniversary and had an awesome meal! Our waiter was Matt and he was excellent. Can't say enough about this restaurant. You have to go there and experience the food!"}
{"text":"Always good food, always great customer service! Been coming here for years with my friends and family, you can never go wrong with any choice dish! From burgers, to salads, to fine dining dishes like duck and rack of lamb I've never been disappointed. Do you like martinis? The martini choices age fantastic, try the starburst!! And for dessert, get the featured bread pudding!!"}
{"text":"Great service and fresh food..  salsa and drink bar needed some serious attention but they were quite busy.  Pleasantly surprised.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because my wife said so. To quote, \"there has rarely been a restaurant that can provide good food and good service. The \"not a monte cuban\" was delicious, the fries were cooked perfect, and that server has always had your glass filled.\" And, yes, i would have to agree. The calamari was cooked perfectly and my sliders were definitely worth coming back for. The lunch crowd was steady and the sole server (Rebecca) worked her butt off and everyone was happy. Probably only the second time i ever rated a restaurant a 5."}
{"text":"I Freaking love Moe's! We use them for corporate catering every chance we get. She is super friendly and easy to deal with. I literally call her and tell her what we need and how many people and have no worries after that! She is on time and reasonably priced. Not to mention the food is absolutely wonderfully delicious!!!!! Cant say enough good about Moes! Matt  Youngstown Ohio"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a long time but I have always passed it up since it is always so crowded. But this time, we put our name in, went up the street for a drink and came back for a later seating.  We were seated in the dining room side as the bar area was still packed.  The dining room is nothing special but comfortable.    They have an interesting cocktail list and we started with a round of drinks and appetizers.  We selected the hot peppers and the tater tots.  The hot peppers were delicious, not too spicy and the sauce was light and flavorful.  But those tater tots.  Homemade with chunkier bits of potato and well seasoned, these were devoured in an instant.  Our server Natalie explained the menu (which changes monthly) and recommended the Short Ribs.  They were served on Bleu cheese polenta with candied brussels sprouts.  It was a great combination and they were light with the Bleu cheese.    My wife had the Scallops and these were served on a bed a goat cheese risotto. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the goat cheese overpowered the risotto and gave it an unusual texture.    Our friends had the Pecan Crusted Lamb Rack with dried cherry and Brie risotto.  I had a taste and the lamb was wonderful.  The risotto was different and had a unique flavor, but I think this dish might be better paired with couscous or quinoa.  Overall, we had a wonderful meal and will definitely be back to try some other dishes.  Natalie provided great service and was really knowledgable about the menu.  We might visit on an off night so as to have a better chance of getting a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight food was amazing and the service from Ryan was fantastic go see him!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic menu that changes on a regular basis. The staff is both knowledgeable & very friendly.  The food is awesome & should be consumed earlier & often.  Pan seared scallops are worth a felony.  The More Betta burger worth getting cut. Excuse my references, I've been watching a lot of gangster movies."}
{"text":"S l o w Very loud in the larger side.   Been there many times & prefer it in the evening- lunch seems too slow.  It is lively inside and friendly."}
{"text":"Had short rib sliders and creme brulee.  Delicious as always.  One of my favs in cfo."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my parents and they suggested that Moe's was one of the best restaurants in town. They were wrong.  We went in for lunch and sat on the bar side. The food was so god damned boring and the service sucked as well. This is just another place that exists because there aren't any good restaurants in the area that would put it out of business.  Our bill was over $100 for three of us at lunch and everyone thought the whole experience was shitty. I would gladly pay another $100 just to have the time back that I wasted at this restaurant.  This place might be good if your other favorite restaurant is the cafeteria at some nursing home."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch, shared the tator tots, which were pleasantly not what we expected, way better than imagined. I got the fish taco's with the pineapple slaw which were good, but nothing to rave about. Service was great. My friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while, spent a lot of time chatting, server was attentive but not intrusive. Great place to meet friends or a date."}
{"text":"Moe's is such a Cuyahoga Falls gem. Really high quality, homemade foods. They rotate the fancy side menu, which always looks exceptional. The beef tenderloin and lamb rack were expertly prepared! The tavern side is really great too for a more casual setting! Love that Moe Betta burger! The wait staff is also super attentive and really knowledgable about the wines!"}
{"text":"I've been here with my parents, friends, etcetera several times, and normally it's a fantastic restaurant. It's a small, classy restaurant that also has a tavern that serves burgers and sandwiches in a more casual atmosphere. Nearly every time I've eaten there, it's been fantastic.   However, the last time I was there, everything was seriously off, causing me to reduce what should be a 4 or 5 star rating down to a 3 star. The calamari,while normally great, was tough, chewy, and cold--and not in the good way. My mother ordered steelhead trout---it was CLEARLY salmon. They tried to say they were \"cutting the trout like salmon\" but my family, being one that likes to fish, knows the difference. My dad's shortribs were tough and tasted old. I ordered the mussel appetizers as an entree. I have done this several times and they're normally good, but the other night, they cut the size nearly in half, they were cold, and some did not taste very good at all.   Most of the time I would highly recommend this restaurant. However, I would keep the recent negatives in mind."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service is slow. It took 45 minutes for us to get our dinner and we were there for about two hours. Some of the food was cold when it arrived too. We ended up just taking our food home to eat later because it was so late and some of the food was cold. The portions are good for the price, but it is expensive. My family has been here before and say it's usually a lot better, I guess it was just a bit busy tonight."}
{"text":"Came here for my 1st time for lunch.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and will be back.    Cons: #1- we were there just after opening and I thought it smelled funky upon walking in.  Not sure if it's something they clean with or what.   #2- service does seem slow and there was only 1 other table for the 1st hour.   Seemed to wait so long between the app and the main lunch.  #3- she gave us some bread and their special made flavored butter, both were very tasty, but some of the bread was stale and dried out.   Pros: #1- our server was friendly and knew the menu and the wines.  All recommendations were spot on.  #2-  all food was  extremely good!! # 3- The glass wines they offer r good, I had CC cab and really enjoyed it.  #3 - get the sausage stuffed peppers app!!! Omg was that delicious!  It's spicy too!  So if u don't like spicy, don't get it.  It was a large amount and can easily be shared by 4 people or eaten as main meal, there were only 2 of us and we took half of it home.   #4- I got the pesto chicken sandwich with a side of their potato salad.  The sandwich was tasty and good but their potato salad was probably the  BEST I ever had at a restaurant!  #5- my friend had one if their salads and I can't recall which one, however, I do recall it had walnuts in it, and she ate the whole thing and said it was very good.    I do recommend, and will be back again despite the few small cons....the food was fantastic"}
{"text":"I usually only write positive Yelp reviews as I am not one to bring someone/another business down based on my personal opinions. However, I can't ignore the blatant disregard/disrespect my mother and I experienced today at this glorified bar. We made reservations for 7:30 on the bar side of the restaurant on a Thursday because we were unsure of how crowded the place would be; it wasn't crowded at all, only a few people in the bar at all, 1 table in the dining area.  We arrived to no hostess/greeting whatsoever and stood around awkwardly until we went up to the bar and asked where we were supposed to check in. We were finally pointed to a booth across from the bar. We then waited 10-15 minutes before we were even brought our menus by a frazzled waitress who mumbled \"I didn't know I was sat\". No apology, nothing, not to mention the bartenders saw us sitting there FOREVER and did nothing. Another 5+ minutes goes on before our drink orders were taken. Finally we get our drinks and proceed to order, from an entirely different server or bartender or whoever they were. She was short and borderline rude. We wait even longer to have our drink orders brought over by yet another bartender. The rest of the meal preceded similarly. I had to beg the HOSTESS to bring our check over. Don't even get me started on the RIDICULOUS prices for the mediocre bar food we received. The food was not bad at all, but if you're charging $12 an app with bad service, your food better be STELLAR. I really wanted to like this local establishment but it seems like if the employees don't know you, you will be treated like garbage. Never again!"}
{"text":"Moe's is one of my favorite local restaurants. If I were taking someone I wanted to really treat out to dinner, this would be a number one pick. Their website states that everything served is made on the premises from scratch and I think the quality really attests to that practice.  It's definitely a bit of an indulgence but, oh man, do they have some excellent eats!  Their menu changes monthly and I have yet to be disappointed.  My most recent excursion to Moe's was with the fam.  Mom and sister ordered the herb grilled chicken with butternut squash ravioli and thyme cream; dad got the pan-seared scallops with smoked mozzarella and roasted yellow pepper pasta with pine nuts and verts; and I ordered the grilled beef tenderloin (medium) with fontina mushroom rissotto and asparagus.    We're a family of sharers which is fortunate because I got to try some of everything!  The grilled chicken was so moist and succulent and paired wonderfully with the ravioli.  The scallops were perfect, mild and sweet, and paired with the most wonderful pasta - it was like a mini explosion of flavor - and at that moment I almost wished I had ordered the scallop dish instead!    My tenderloin, not to be beat, was so tender and flavorful and the mushroom risotto was creamy and, well, mushroomy (YUM) paired well with grilled asparagus that was cooked thoroughly while maintaining its crunchy bite.  Entrees are served with delicious Italian style bread and a butter blend. I can't recall if it's included with the entree or priced separately, but their house side salad is a recommended starter with fresh greens, crostinis with blue cheese and roasted tomato spread, freshly ground black pepper and the homemade white french dressing. (Fabulous!)  We also shared their chocolate lava cake for dessert, divine chocolatey ooze and served with sliced strawberries.. Mmmm.  You don't have to dress up to go to Moe's (but you also won't feel out of place if you do) and they have both a dining room side I think of as being the more \"formal\" side and a tavern side with a full bar, a mix of booths and tables, and a television or two.    Dinner reservations are recommended and I would specify at that time if you have a preference for any given side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"On business travel always looking for a local restaurant with a unique menu. Tonight I selected Moe's Restaurant & I'm very pleased! I had the house salad with the pan seared steelhead trout. Excellent! The potato, bacon,carrot the trout is served over is a nice flavor compliment to this dish. I'm a fan of asparagus! Cooked just perfect! The meal was delicious! The servers work as a team so you are definitely taken care of. They were all very nice. This restaurant seems to host a lot of the locals on the tavern side, a lively upbeat crowd. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch on a Thursday.  I came because of the reviews on Yelp!  Let's start with the good.  We ordered the lobster pierogies, short rib sliders, and the mahi tacos.  No mahi!  They wanted to substitute shrimp.  So, we ordered the crab cakes.  After a 50 minute wait after ordering our food finally arrived! Ugh!  The food was above average but a 50 minute wait for lunch doesn't cut it.  There was really no regard for it either.  There was a large party in another room and this obviously had something to do with it but sorry, not acceptable.  There was not even an apology.  Unfortunate because the food quality was good but poor service is also a key part of a good experience."}
{"text":"Being from out of town we were looking for a good local place to eat and we found it at Moe's. The food was fantastic and all made fresh and that definitely showed. Service was fantastic as well. If you are in the area and need s really good place to eat, here it is."}
{"text":"So we came back, of course because the food was fantastic. We brought friends and I of course talked it up. I was a little more disappointed with this trip and here's why:  As far as the service, they didn't have our reservation for the correct night but luckily for them, they had and open seat for us so no problem there I guess. Our waitress was not terrible, but not terrific either.   So for the food, as an app we got the calamari and the tater tots. The first time we were here the calamari was great, the calamari we had last night was maybe the worst I have ever had. Whether it's a new chef or someone forgot about it, it was the chewiest, most bland app I have ever had. Needless to say I was awfully disappointed. Now, the tater tots were great. Crispy and flavorful and the sauce they served with it was wonderful. My husband got the mushroom ravioli app for dinner and he loved it. It was rich and creamy and really fantastic. I got the short rib sliders app for dinner, which I have got before, and again they were just great. They are fall apart tender with wonderful deep flavor and a great sauce. A friend got a chicken sandwich and although I didn't try that, it looked decent but nothing spectacular. Now, she got a bunch of fries with them and they were incredibly soggy! No crunch or flavor. Come on, fries are easy!  Unfortunately, I had to drop this a star which hurt me to do. The calamari was just too big of a mistake to keep it at that level for me. Don't get me wrong I will absolutely be back and I love how they change the menu monthly."}
{"text":"I'll always think fondly of Moe's because it's the first place where I ever ate crème brûlée, thus making the world a more delicious place to live. It's in a bit of a weird spot, nestled among car dealerships, but it's one of the Falls' best let's-get-fancy-tonight spots, with an ever-changing menu that ranges from elevated standard fare (grilled lamb with bacon jam, fig risotto, & heirloom carrots) to the regionally indulgent (potato pierogis with lobster & shiitake mushrooms). Leave room (& budget) for drinks, as their cocktail options are a thing of beauty."}
{"text":"I was there last night to celebrate my birthday with my Sis, who just arrived from Tampa. The service, the food, the atmosphere and the cocktails were wonderful! I would highly recommend you  experience this wonderful local restaurant. We started with cocktails - I would suggest that you try their lemon drop cocktail. We followed with their lobster with mushroom and potatoe perogie  appetizer in a wonderful sauce. (We both were impressed with the amount of lobster in this appetizer.) For my main entree I had the scampi with mozzarella grits and peas. For dessert we shared, the chocolate lava! The food presentation was beautiful and the portions were generous. This is one local restaurant that truly does five starts. Thanks Moe's for a wonderful dinning experience on my special day. (I wish I could attach the pictures that we took )"}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner as recommended by a client. Appetizers consisted of stuffed peppers and tater tots. Tater tots should've been called something else like big round balls of yummy goodness. Pepper app was super good too. Ordered the walleye for dinner and as I was expecting it was rock solid. Cool place cool atmosphere. I'd definitely hit it again and again. Oh yeah also had the broccoli cheese soup. Best ever with other veggies in it. Go here."}
{"text":"Gimme mo'   I'm not from the area but have been in town a couple of times on business. Luckily, a local friend brought me there and on a recent visit, I went there again.  They have a great and creative variety in their menu options. I had a really good spinach salad and the brisket sliders. Our table shared the home made chips and a dip - which was the low point: Chips were great, dip was a drippy mess - delicious flavor but too runny!   The alcoholic beverages were nicely done. The bill? Too high. Other than sandwich choices, the entrees were all hovering around the $30 mark - a bit much, for what you get.   Would I go again the next time I'm there? Maybe for drinks and apps. I'm not sure I'd recommend for dinner unless you feel like spending a lot."}
{"text":"We had a party of three, with three dinners, two drinks a piece, and dessert, we spent just over $250.00.  We made a reservation ahead of time.  The salads to start were okay, the bacon on them just seemed a little left over, and there was not much flavor to the salad dressings.  The Pomegranate martini was awesome and had a nice ice sheath over it.  My husbands Manhattan was watered down because they made it wrong initially then just poured it in a different glass.  The filet and crispy chicken were good, but the lobster was over cooked and tasted gamey.  The grape tart was delicious and not too heavy.  I still had not finished my last drink when we were asked to leave because the next reservation was waiting on our table.  We had been sitting for just over 2 hours when they asked us to leave.  Typically when you spend $250 in a restaurant for such a small reservation, it is not expected to be asked to leave when you have not finished your drink and it has been only 2 hours.  I do not expect to be returning again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Service was great.  The server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and make great recommendations. Had the bean and sausage soup and the Moe betta burger.  Fabulous.  It was a lot of food for the cost and probably the best burger I've had in years.  We stumbled in by accident and I wasn't expecting much, but the atmosphere was warm and friendly and the food was a taste bud explosion. Amazing.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Moe's represents all that is good about quality local dining.   This is probably considered a \"classy\" or \"fine dining\" restaurant, but it comes with a very casual, comfortable feel that is not pretentious AT ALL.  The ambiance is great...you can go here with a date, for your anniversary, or just a regular night out on the town.     The drink selection is fabulous, I was definitely impressed with the beer.  It would not seem a place like this would have such a good beer selection.   We had the homemade chips and calamari appetizer.   Both were memorable and well executed. Fortunately, I was with a six person group who was all family, so I was able to try several entrees.  All were exceptional, you can get the seafood, pork chops, chicken, or anything on the menu and be impressed.  My double cut pork chop came with bread pudding - which I generally do not like.  It was OUTSTANDING.  I don't even know how they did it.    They often change the menu based on season so its nice to check it out often to see what they have.  This truly is a rare place, it has it all.  I live 40 minutes away and I would gladly run there if I had to."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, casual grub, or a nice dinner. Great bar area and dinner side. Food is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"I alway forget Moe's exists, but I am pleasantly surprised once I remember.  As I finish the last bite of my gouda and vegetable risotto stuffed poblano peppers in a smoked tomato and charred corn cream, it is safe to say that I will be returning to Moe's.  Before the amazing risotto, we had the loaded tater tots which I am going to say were just okay. Not good, not bad-just okay. The loaded tater tots seem to be a favorite of restaurants that I go to (Burntwood Tavern & Red Steakhouse), so there is some room for comparison now and I can say I've had better.  But please let us give a moment of silence for how incredibly amazing the braised short rib sliders, white cheddar, horseradish cream and crispy fried onions were.  Each bite was so delicious I almost wished we had another order. The fried onions were lightly battered and not greasy at all, giving the perfect crunch. The horseradish wasn't that over powering taste either, I want to say it was accompanied by swiss cheese (don't quote me on that) and it was just...so. Good.  The service was on point too. Everyone promptly bussed out table, filled the waters and packed the dishes we weren't able to finish because we ordered about 10 things.  So hey Moe's! You rock! Keep doing what you do."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first time it was excellent.  Tonight... eh, two-point-five to three stars, max.  They have a great wine selection and bartenders/waitstaff which are very knowledgeable about the wine parings.  Their menu changes seasonally; and, the executive chef obviously takes great care in developing dishes which are creative and geographically appropriate.  This past winter I had a pork dish (I recall) which was quite delectable.  Tonight I shared a lobster/shitake mushroom pirogi appetizer in which the lobster was kinda gross (dry, very fishy tasting;) and, as an entree I had a duck comfit (pronounced: 'come feet',  NOT 'come fit' - thank you) which just wasn't that dazzling.  For the price which we were paying for the meal, I expect dazzling.  I initially gave Moe's three stars; but, then I reflected on the one dish which was truly inspiring...  Peaches seared in amaretto with fresh vanilla bean ice cream.  Very, very tasty.  They get an extra star just for that desert.  (And, I am normally not a person who cares much for sweets outside the occasional peanut butter cookie.)  Good service, eh prices, hit or miss menu... but, when it's good it's DAMN good."}
{"text":"Moe's Restaurant has the best burgers in town!  I was recently introduced to Moe's and visited for the first time on a Saturday for lunch. I entered in on the bar side and sat at a small table beside the wall. When they are busier, in the evening, they also open up their larger dining room area on the other side of the building. During their lunchtime hours they offer a selection of sandwiches, salads and appetizers. They only carry their full menu at dinner.   When I visited for lunch there was only one server for the 7 tables that were filled but she did an excellent job. I never felt that I was overlooked or not taken care of. I let her know it was my first time visiting and she told me a little bit about the menu and suggested their \"Moe Betta\" burger because a lot of people really like it. I took her up on her suggestion and ordered a side of their homemade chips and dip to go along with it.  And this burger was fantastic!   The beef was perfectly charred on the outside and cooked to perfection on the inside. The bacon was crispy. The vegetables were fresh and once combined together with their special sauce it was absolutely delicious. They use an 80/20 ground which made it juicy and flavorful!  Their chips were good too, but not phenomenal. In the couple weeks since my initial visit I have ordered this burger to go a couple times with a side of their giant loaded tater tots.   Their Loaded Tater Tots are really good!  They are thick chunks of potatoes with melty cheese quickly fried with a light breading. They do not have as heavy of a breading and are not near as greasy as the giant tots from Burntwood Tavern.  I have not yet had the chance to have one of the dinner meals from here though their ever-changing seasonal menu looks really good. I can say that this is probably the best burger I have found in the area. It is definitely more expensive than some of the fast-casual burger places around, but if that is not a big deal then you are definitely getting a fantastic tasting burger at Moe's!"}
{"text":"Well Done Cuyahoga Falls!  I am really impressed!  Due to my travel schedule I eat out 2-3 times A WEEK!  This is one of the better restaurants I have eaten in all year.   I sat in the bar booth and was immediately welcomed by the server and bartender.  Notable on a fairly busy night!  Drink menu was super!  Chunk lobster Pirogues in a Shitake mushroom/black olive/ diced root veggies Ragu were WONDERFUL. Entrée was a rich braised lamb shank and I just loved this fall off the bone treat.   This is run by a professional and it shows.  They offer new and interesting items that make you wish you had a bigger stomach ( and Liver )."}
{"text":"Second visit to Moes.  Excellent food, great atmosphere and knowledgable staff.  I had the pork shank and my coworkers both tried the duck breast.  All dishes prepared perfectly and great Side dishes complimented both entrees.    This will be my first recommendation to anyone visiting The Akron area ."}
{"text":"I went to Moes recently in a group of six. I am glad we had reservations because it was packed! The atmosphere was very social as tables are close to one another. I appreciate that the waitress did not rush us as we were there to enjoy the evening. We ordered two appetizers to share as a table. We all loved our food, especially the Cod and Lasagnette. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After 6 months of wanting to try Moe's, we finally went tonight. Holy cow, it was amazing. We had the braised short rib sliders (which were huge and delicious), then I had the duck breast, and boyfriend had the steak (which was delicious and he devoured). The duck breast was cooked exactly as requested, and it came with this phenomenal French toast inspired pear and Brie bread pudding, which was topped with a maple pomegranate syrup. It was so good I took little bites just to make it last. I literally could eat that every day. So good. The service was great as well. I can't wait to go back! I think we'll go for happy hour to get some appetizers and drinks (they had some great cocktails but I was too full for anything else). So glad to have this in The Falls."}
{"text":"I've been to Moe's a few times over the years, and the food is consistent and pretty good. Last time I was there I had the charcuterie board, a special drink for the month and the dirty bird martini. The charcuterie board contained way too many sweet items for me versus savory, but was still decently done. The dirty bird martini is very good with Tito's vodka instead of Grey Goose. This time I had the crab cakes which were just fair. I wouldn't recommend them. They were fishy and kind of dry and bland. I would have preferred a sauce and more seasoning versus the pico like salsa that came with them. The homemade chips and Parmesan dressing were good, and the tomato salad with balsamic and Mozzarella was very good. I wouldn't say I've ever described Moe's as excellent, but definitely very good. It's nice to see a place in the Akron area that's not a chain.   However, it's the service on the Tavern side can get pretty sketchy and ruin the experience. I went there later on a Friday a couple of weeks ago, sat at a table with three other people and the server had a serious attitude after my friend asked a simple question. She warmed up later, but the attitude lingered for a while. I was told she's related to the owners and gets away with a lot.   On my visit tonight I was appalled. I'm celebrating my birthday next week, and my friend took me out tonight because he'll be busy next week. We went at 5:30 and were there about an hour and a half. We had drinks, and appetizer and dinner. About ten minutes before we were getting ready to leave, a young lady that's a member of the staff who wasn't even our server informs us that someone is waiting for our table and if we'd like to continue talking she could find us a comfortable place somewhere else! First off, the place was full with nowhere else to sit and secondly, it wasn't like we'd been there 3 or 4 hours tying up a table just having drinks or something. They don't take reservations on that side, and I'm not sure why they would ask someone to move just because someone else wanted to sit there. They were so busy I couldn't even get someone to ask for a manager. I was very disappointed at how rude that was, and I'll think twice about returning. I may giving the restaurant side one more try, but I'm not sure after being treated rudely twice. Very disappointing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Alright so I initially had no idea that this place was even a restaurant. Everytime I drove by the Moe's sign, I assumed it was some dive bar (similar to that in The Simpsons). Then I finally heard a friend talk about how badly they wanted to have dinner at Moe's one night. I looked up Moe's here on yelp and to my surprise...it really IS a restaurant!  I decided to have a lunch date with my boyfriend here before going to see a movie. I had a cosmo which was slightly overpriced compared to other restaurants, mussels by the piece, and the wedge salad. My data had a bourbon and a burger. Overall the food was good, but not great. The atmosphere is classy and comfortable, but rather dark. The dinner menu, which rotates monthly, was overpriced in my opinion. I suggest you try this place out for yourself and be the judge."}
{"text":"My experience at Moe's last night perfectly illustrates why I'm just not eating out at fine dining restaurants as often these days. There are just too many middling hacks practicing \"upscale American bistro\" cuisine, and I'm tired of throwing my money at them.   As always, the menu looks so promising. Approximately seasonal. Trendy ingredients. Lots of cool French and Italian words. But unfortunately, reading the menu is the highlight of the night.   LESSON 1: Don't buy expensive wines from places that REALLY don't know their shit. My first tip off should have been a wine list that was extremely safe. Everything was from conspicuous, high profile California labels, which is a convenient way to earn a free pass if you don't know what you're doing. I asked them to recommend a cabernet (to me, all Napa cabs are crapshoots....I can't afford to drink them often enough to develop any particular loyalties), and I gave them a very generous price range to work with. What they sent us was still not very good. The fruit was too sharp, green and young...not ready for drinking yet. I really don't enjoy spend $80 on a bottle of wine not ready for drinking. Admittedly, this problem goes much deeper than Moe's has complete control over, but restaurants who know their wine will find a way to deliver something good.   LESSON 2: Seasonal does not equal local. I ordered the rack of venison. The server immediately killed my fantasy of eating a husky, wild-born white-tailed deer by informing me that it was, in fact, farm-raised in New Zealand. What???? You have to get deer imported from halfway around the world? Have you not seen the ZILLIONS of deer in the Cuyahoga Valley, prancing in and out of traffic, eating all the native flora? JUST GO SHOOT ONE! You will be doing everyone a huge favor (except perhaps for the deer itself). By god, I'll help you build the fucking tree-stand.   As it turns out, my foreign farm-raised deer got overcooked, and was pretty terrible, made worse by extremely bland accompaniments, including whole chickpeas....more on those next:   LESSON 3: Whole chickpeas suck. Unless they are pureed and deep fried into a falafel by some suspected terrorist and served at 4AM in a shady NYC neighborhood through bulletproof glass, and you believe this particular falafel has the ability to save your life, or at least delay the inevitable vomiting on yourself by a good half-hour....unless all these conditions are met, chickpeas are not worthy of human consumption. They taste like wet cardboard.   LESSON 4: Glacially slow service. Unforgivably slow service. We were seated there for over 3 hours. Longer than your average major league baseball game. Longer than it takes the Browns to lose 38-3.   And here's the key thing....you pay a severe physiological penalty by having to wait over an hour between appetizer and entree. Namely, YOU LOSE YOUR APPETiTE!!! The stomach says, \"Ok, my work here is apparently done,\" and proceeds to tell you brain not to feed it anymore. So, here I am faced with the prospect of suffering through a $33 dollar entree that's overcooked and that I'm not remotely hungry for, because my stomach clocked out about forty minutes ago.   What a regrettable time. The duck taco appetizers were good...that's the only thing nice I can say. Otherwise, I would have been better off staying at home with a bag of stale Cheetos."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Wonderful food! Great atmosphere! Highly recommend! Little hidden gem of Cuyahoga Falls!!!!! Entertaining 90's radio station playing during dinner was a conversation starter lol! Menu changes every month which is very cool!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Always enjoy our meals there. The owner is very pleasant and have know her for years. I love the fact she changes the specials every month. We can always find something we want on the menu and is always prepared the way we like it. The servers are always pleasant and very helpful and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Ive had the pleasure eating here a few times, very welcoming and friendly staff and the food has been very good on each occassion.  Love the Mussels w/Italian sausage and peppers, delish!  Great burgers too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Was not that great, the locals apparently thought it was the Bee's Knee's. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle tasted stale & bland, the chicken was kinda of crispy shaken bake type, which I doubt was deep fried and the breading was terrible. I did however liked the house salad and complementary bread. My friend got a Moe-rgarita, I tried it and that was awesome but the food was not, especially for what they charge! Maybe had I ordered something off the $30 some dollar dinner plate menu (in this case chalk board) things might have been better. They should of taken a big piece of chicken breast added hella breading and deep fried it with thinner fresh more sweeter waffle."}
{"text":"Stuffed peppers were the best I have ever had. Great selection. Plan on going back without having to order just take out. More Moe's"}
{"text":"Very pricey. Food was great . We sat at the bar. Two bartenders on duty , terrible service slow on everything from meal to drinks to me trying to pay my 114.00 bill.  Would try again but would sit at table to hopefully get service."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Moe's, we eat here quite often, but many times split a burger (which are fab btw) but last night we both ordered entrees. My tenderloin dish was just absolutely delicious! It was perfectly cooked, the lobster equally perfect, the duck fat fried potatoes had larger ground salt & were perfectly crunchy! & bernaise well that was just the icing on all the other deliciousness filling my plate. Love it when an old favorite never fails to still impress!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I looked for 20 minutes for a good place to eat while in Kent for business and glad I went here! Had the king trout and peanut butter pie and would recommend that you run here to get both now!!!  Everything else looks good in the menu also and the atmosphere is a little classy and upbeat! Great experience!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 3.5! Came to Moe's for dinner last night because the locals love it and I hadn't tried it out yet.  I must say I don't agree with them.  They have fine dining on one side and a bar and dining area on the other side.  We got there about 8 o'clock and had dinner at the bar.  They had loud 90's music playing from Crash Test Dummies to Mariah Carey...  Ha.  It was kind of odd. The bartenders were enjoyable and gave good service.  The food was just mediocre.  I had the braised short rib sliders, white cheddar, horseradish cream and crispy fried onions for my entree and a half wedge salad the Mister moe betta' burger topped with bacon, cheddar, pepper jack cheese and moe's secret sauce for his entree and homemade tots for an appetizer.  My sliders weren't very hot and slightly dry but they had nice flavor.  The tots were pretty good, loved the spicy sour cream aioli they were served with.  My fiancée enjoyed his burger with the house made chips.  I guess I went in expecting more because of the way people rave about Moe's. Next time I will just have to try out an entree!"}
