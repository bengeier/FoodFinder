{"text":"Vraiment déçue Très cher  - 85$ (avant taxes et service!!) pour :  1 homard, 1 crabe, des moules et un peu de crevettes. Ce package ne contient aucun accompagnement et 1 seul blé d'inde!!! Aucune salade ou panier de pain. Rien. Les poissons étaient ok, sans plus. Servis dans des plats recouverts de sacs de plastique!!!!!!! BEURK. Le maïs était pâteux, achété sous cellophane à l'épicerie alors que le resto est tout près du marché Jean Talon pour du bon maïs frais... les frites (achetées en surplus)  = pas bonnes, congelées, pas faites maison. Toutes les sauces = beaucoup beaucoup trop salées - et on avait pris intensité \"doux\" Service approximatif...  moi qui cherche du poisson et du crabe à Montréal, ça manque. Le concept de ce resto est sympa, mais la qualité n'y est pas."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Messy food. Served in plastic bags (why I do not know). Service while friendly was terrible with all plates coming out at different times. Food quality was disappointing. Mussels were terrible. Drinks served in those stupid maison jars.   Would never go back. A really bad experience."}
{"text":"They have been open only 10 days and I am upset I only found them on my last day in Montreal. Nano Dada, the chef and Co owner was such a gracious hostess. Food was incredible. We ordered the seafood bucket with a side of clams and each item came out alone, crab, shrimp, mussels and lobster which made everything piping hot and delicious.  We combined the lemon garlic with pecheur seasoning at a more than medium less than 911 spice level.  It was so good I did not use the gloves they provided just to be able to lick the sauce from my fingers. French fries, rice and biscuits were just as top shelf as the seafood. I come from a part of the USA where seafood is plentiful and I would be hard pressed to say I had anything better than what we had today. Nano is the type of hostess that makes you feel like you are visiting family."}
{"text":"Concept was good but the food wasn't. Way over priced for what you get and the alcoholic drinks were watered down. Appetizer portions were small and tasted bland. For $13.95, you'd expect more than 8 calamari rings with tasteless tartar sauce. As for the main, we ordered 2 seafood buckets and the mussels that came with it were tiiiiiny and every other shell was closed. The shrimp was tough and dry. I didn't get to try the crab and lobster due to my allergy but that may have been a good thing. You'd be better off boiling your own seafood at home and throw in some seasoning powder for flavoring cause that's basically all it was. The only good thing about our meal was the company. Needless to say, we will never go back."}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!!!!!!!! I had an amazing night and I recommend this place to everyone one. I was there tonight for the first time and believe me it won't be the last. If I could give them 10 stars I would.  1st and foremost the service is beyond amazing. Best I have ever had and I have tried many places in the past. Friendly and professional plus the staff is super funny and helpful. We went early so the place was still quiet and the owner came to chat with is and offered us a shooter on the house and even had one with us. It was so nice of her to do this and to take the time to explain to us how the menu works.  We started with a few drinks and you will be happy to know that they have a pretty well stocked bar with liquor, wine and beer. We had a few alcoholic lemonade and they are to die for.  Now time for the most important part...the food!!! Everything I mean EVERYTHING we tried was astonishing. We were 4 and we all had a different plate so we could try more stuff. We had 2 entrees to start and both did not disappoint. Everything is freshly made, well seasoned and hot. We had the fried calamari and the panko shrimps. Both very good but I preferred the calamari and also it came with homemade sauce. Main dishes we took both combos, seafood pasta and also lobster and shrimp mac & cheese. It was all so very tasty and the seasoning is on point. The fries and the corn on the cob are the best sides it just melts in your mouth.  Even if it is a bit pricey you have to remember that it is seafood and worth EVERY penny. I cannot way to go back to try more stuff!"}
{"text":"I wish I could add more stars! Had a wonderful experience dining here the first time! Warm and friendly staff, great happy hour specials- and the pecheur seasoning mix on fleek! Worth every dollar, nice to know Montreal has authentic one of kind businesses with great food, experience and staff! Will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Plates were completely emptied because the food was delicious! A bit on the expensive side but it's lobster so understandable I guess. Fish and chips is the best thing you can get after the lobster... it's a fulfilling dish! I'd also recommend the rice on the side, it's succulent!"}
{"text":"Belle endroit,  bon service  de la part de notre  serveuse . Bon repas et super désert ! J'y retourne  c'est sûr !"}
{"text":"Il n'y a pas beaucoup de restaurant de fruit de mer à Montréal, encore moins des choix abordables. C'est par le biais d'un groupe à rabais du genre de groupon que nous avons découvert la Table du pêcheur. Nous y avons donc réservé pour une quinzaine de personnes pour fêter deux anniversaires. Dès la reservation, la proprio était très sympathique et répondait à nos questions. Son but premier était de nous accommoder et nous satisfaire. Nous avons pris une table d'hôte de 4 services à 45$ qui comprenait une entrée de salade pour 2, une entrée de moules pour 2, une entrée de calamars pour 2 et le plats principales avec des choix de crevettes, saumon, pâtes aux fruits de mer, crevettes/poulet et queue de homard le tout servi avec riz, légumes et épi de maïs . Premièrement, après les entrées que nous n'avons pas terminé nous étions déjà rassasiés, il restait au moins la moitié des moules sur la table. Les plats principaux étaient délicieux et goûteux, plutôt que de servir les fruits de mer avec du citron ce l'était avec des agrumes. Original. Mon plat fut une poitrine de poulet coupé en lanière avec de grosses crevettes, le tout servi dans une petit sauce rouge. Clou de la soirée est la chanson de bonne fête avec un \"picture frame\" pour prendre des photos des fêtées avec un beau chapeau de pince de homard. Le décor est nautique/kitsch. Tout était très bon. Nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"This place was great! I found their spice mix very tasty and the prices we're not too bad. They offered us biscuits on the house and some lovely watermelon at the end of our meal. The owner was very friendly and they made sure we were satisfied with our meal. I would definately return!"}
