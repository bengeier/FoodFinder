{"text":"Just went there tonight. I tried the salt and pepper pork chop, chili ox tripe, brocoli with chicken, all of them are yummy :P I didn't try the butter chicken wings because of my cholesterol issue. My friends told me it's really delicious. Don't be fool by the name of the restaurant, there are lots of delicacies other than noodles. If you like spicy this is the right place to go.  If you don't want it to be too spicy you can just tell the waiter. Too bad my phone was out of battery by the time I was there I would have taken pictures of the food. Place is clean and service was amicable :) thumb up!"}
{"text":"This is officially the worst eatery on the island of Montreal. The place opens until 1 am on weekends, my friends and I arrived around 11:50pm and the waiter was already sleepy.  The service was extremely terrible and careless, the waiter ignored us when we came in and didn't even bring us the menu. We were three but they only gave us two glasses of water and no napkins. He was also pretty rude and never refilled our water.  I ordered the fried rice with pork chops and everything was so dry that you'd believe salted crackers have more water than their food. Nevertheless, I was very hungry so I decided to use some Sriracha sauce, and then I noticed the weird taste of it and realized that it was expired four months ago.  The place is not very clean, and the table was somehow sticky.  They accept cash as their sole method of payment, not very convenient.  Please don't go, for your own sake. Go eat McDonald's, yeah that's how horrible this place is."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you this is not a noodle house, it is a full-on Chinese restaurant with a complete menu. Over the last couple of months this place has become our go to spot for Chinese as it is close to our house and as good as any of the places that we frequent in Chinatown.   Like many Chinese places one suspects that the best stuff is on the special section of the menu written only in Chinese charters.  So to get the upper hand we had a friend translate it for us:  1.       Broccoli with spicy sauce  2.       Ox tripe (salad)  3.       Chicken with sauce  - not sure this is boiled or fried  4.       Ox tripe in chili sauce (salad)  5.       Sautéed  eggplant with Tofu  6.       Sautéed sliced pork with vegetable (boil the pork first and slice to pieces, and then fry it a bit, cooked with vegetable)  7.       Scrambled egg with tomato  8.       Pork ear in chili sauce(salad)  9.       Yu Shiang shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce  10.   Spicy fried chicken  11.   Pork with sweet and sour sauce (pork covered with flour and deep fried, and cook with sweet and sour sauce)  12.   Peanut mixed with pork tripe (salad)  13.   Chicken with BBQ sauce in a casserole  14.   Pork tongue in chili sauce (salad)  15.   Pork tripe in chili sauce (salad)  16.   Five species and spicy pork rib  17.   Boiled chicken in salt  18.   Yu shiang eggplant in a casserole with spicy garlic sauce  19.   Assorted mushroom in a casserole  20.   Braised beef brisket in a casserole  21.   Chef's choice - not sure what's it.  22.   Pork tripe in chili sauce  23.   Sizzling pork tripe with XO sauce (in a hot iron plate)  24.   Sautéed beef with two kinds of mushroom  25.   Sizzling beef ribs in black pepper sauce (in a hot iron plate)"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 star review. The food was decent, the chairs are comfortable, the place is totally clean, the service (a little bit abrupt, a little bit slow, but not out of the ordinary for Montreal where I expect service to be gruff) was acceptable in both English and French.  The menu is simple but it has all the favorites. Don't expect pages and pages of obscure items like you might find at a bigger Chinese restaurant.  Our bill was $27 incl tax and tip for three people and we definitely had enough to eat. Be aware that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"First of all, don't eat the noodles. Second of all, if you expect some sort of westernized chinese food you will hate this place. Third of all, if you in fact love authentic Chinese food and enjoy spicy food there is a speciality section in the menu with no translation (for the love of god don't report this to the government)... if you can't understand it order the stuffs with a thumbs up next to it and I guarantee you will like it!   O it is really cheap and they always play sportscenter which is a plus."}
