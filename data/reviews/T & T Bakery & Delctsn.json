{"text":"WOW!!  Best bread in all of Cleveland.  Make sure you bring cash though as they don't take credit/debit or checks."}
{"text":"Italian bread and sourdough bread are delicious.  Donuts are lighter and have more flavor that chains like Dunkin.  The custard filled chocolate iced is delish, the cinnamon rolls are yummy just need icing to go on the sides too, the apple filled cinnamon dusted will make you CRAVE them and the cream sticks - just grab a few. 

Quick polite service with only one downside - cash only!"}
