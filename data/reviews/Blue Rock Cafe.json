{"text":"I love reuben sandwiches, and this is the best one around!  I will definitely be back time and time again. Also, try the carrot cake. You won't be disappointed!  Add good music on top of the food, you'll have a good night out!"}
{"text":"Great food,  nice music venue.  Will go again now that i found it. Mushroom burger was yum yum."}
{"text":"You know...  I had low expectations when we walked into the joint. We were brought here meeting friends and I had no choice in food. I thought, \"this is going to be awful.\" The menu was seemingly optimistic and too cheery for what undoubtedly was disgusting bar food.   I ordered the Joan Jett Philly steak sandwich. How bad could they screw it up?  My sandwich came. It looked good... But looks can be deceiving. The nicest looking sandwich can be a mess of cheap meat and even worse cheese. Served with thin sliced fries that were obviously homemade. \"That's the best part of the meal,\" I thought.   I was wrong. The sandwich was divine. High quality steak grilled to perfection. Tender and flavorful. Grilled onions and peppers.... Not too many. Just enough. High quality melted cheese and a surprisingly flavorful fresh Italian bun. The fries were excellent - soft and crispy.   Four stars, you ask? The service was just so-so. I had to go up to the bar to get drinks and the bartender/server while friendly, didn't check back with us and I had to go to the bar to get mayo and refills."}
{"text":"Took my 2 little boys (6 & 8) there for lunch around June 2012.  There menu is kind of eclectic, but we ordered basically a bagel with melted cheese on it for them.  They put such a ridiculous amount of garlic on everything, that it was UN-edible.  I mean, who screws up a Grilled cheese!  We've never gone back.."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great happy hour specials. Good live music room.  Food is reasonably priced.  Good decor & vibes.  Convenient location."}
{"text":"Decent place. But the Blue Rock charges a 5 dollar \"Music fee\"  I was not made aware of this till I received my bill.  So be careful when drinks or food is ordered."}
{"text":"Great Reuben sandwich and chicken salad. Jazz band is great. Cover charge was asked for on entrance. Gotta love Santana and the live music talent."}
{"text":"Need to remove when a place closes down! We went arrived at this location only to find it's not there anymore!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!   Staff very nice and courteous!  Love that they give local musicians a venue.   Very laid back atmosphere....LOVE it here.   Food is really good as well!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service!   Went there for the first time to hear a friend's band.  Let me preface by saying that my boyfriend is the lead singer in a band, so I spend plenty of time in many different establishments.   This is a small venue-and yet 99% of the tables and seats at the bar had a bright pink card saying \"reserved\" with people's names on them.  It appeared that these \"reservations\" were the bar's doing-as they all had individual names, not \"reserved for the band\". A bar and/or band should never hold more than a couple tables--what about people who might have made the trip to hear that band for the first time and are angry that there is nowhere to sit, or the regular patrons who come in every week?! How about someone who just stumbled upon the establishment and wanted to check it out?  The woman at the door pointed us to a booth, but obviously she didn't seem to know or care that they were \"reserved\"-- We found one tiny table right next to the door-the server asked if we wanted menus, brought them over but didn't bother to take our drink order..the draft from the doors and ventilation  was so bad and we  wanted to move-the same woman who could not be bothered to take our drink orders just said to us \"oh well it'll be warm enough in here in in a little bit\".  We found the only 2 seats at the bar not reserved and moved there.    Usually service at a bar is pretty good. Not here!! Took forever for someone to take our food order, and then we waited over 30 minutes for burgers--did they have to go kill a cow?  The same woman never said a word, no apologies, no \"let me check on your orders\", etc  The food was decent, but woefully  overpriced for the small size of the burger itself.     My boyfriend asked if they could change the tv closest to us to the Cavs playoff game.  The same woman said \"no-he's watching this show\" and pointed to this guy next to me who had never even glanced at the screen the entire time.   20 minutes later the owner changed it, with about 30 seconds left in the game  I always tip at least 20%, even when the service is not the best.   Last night I barely left 10%, and that was a gift.  I have since talked to friends who said they have had the same bad experiences at the Blue Rock.  Loved the band by the way--we will just see them play at another bar."}
