{"text":"C'est drôle comment les hasards arrivent toujours à point... et nous font découvrir des merveilles ! 

Le menu de Saint-Valentin de chez Julien Traiteur ne m'a pas laissé sur ma faim, loin de la. En entrée, une délicieuse salade au canard fumé et grenade croquait sous la dent, remplie de saveur hivernale et réconfortante. Le poisson du jour fut excellent aussi, cuit à la perfection et léger, servi avec petits légumes de saison à la vapeur. De l'autre côté de la table, mon compagnon de lunch a pour sa part pris un burger, servi sur une ardoise avec frites et mayonnaise maison. (voir photos)

Le service était à la hauteur du repas, et quoi que nous n'avions pas réservé, nous avons pu avoir une belle petite place tout près de la fenêtre. 

C'est à réessayer :)"}
{"text":"Very Cute little bistro staff is very welcoming! Food is good a bit pricey. We ordered the foie gras 2 ways,it was very good! Although the little crackers they gave us to accompany the foie gras were VERY salty. I felt like I was eating just pure salt. For the main course we ordered fish and chips,it was average not worth the price of 26$. The cassoulet for 2 was delicious! It was a good portion of bacon,sausage, 1 duck leg and the bottom of the skillet was filled with beans. The bacon had a nice fix of sweetness and saltiness. While the duck meat easily fell off the bone. And the sausage with juicy with a hint of spiciness. Overall a good place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious dishes with fresh quality ingredients. Mains are mostly meat dishes, in addition to a duck and a fish dish. Bread is very good. Good variety in starters and deserts. We were 4, and we enjoyed every dish served. The location is great, too. The restaurant is in a quaint old town on the main street."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant tucked away in old La Prairie facing a historic church. Huge floor to ceiling windows that allow a unobstructed view of the neighbourhood. Weekdays there are table d'hôte specials at $20 & $25. I opted for this and took the steak tartare that came with a generous portion of fries and salad. There was so much tartare that I had enough for lunch the next day. You can't get a better deal than this. My partner took the filet mignon (not part of the specials) that is cooked sous vide. I've never tasted a more evenly cooked piece of meat like this. Wow. So juicy. Different because it wasn't cooked on the grill. We also shared a French onion soup which had a piece of duck on the top. It was very flavourful and could be a meal all on its own.  My entree was a salad that had pieces of sweet baked onion in it that gave a nice sweet pop. Desert was sugar pie that was also good but not rich. The sugar was very light and I tend to prefer it darker with caramel undertones.  Overall this is a great neighbourhood French bistro with an extensive wine list and reasonable prices. I highly recommend you support your local chefs! Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place, in the hidden quiet neighbourhood of busy Ave Tachereau in Brossard.  The surroundings remind me so much of Old Montreal. 

Food was very delicately prepared and presented. 

Hard to find a restaurant that scores high on these factors below, and Chez Julien got it all
1. Ambiance
2. Service
3. Food taste
4. Food presentation
5. Clean Washroom facilities

Not cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"Sympathique.  Ça vaut la peine avec le menu soirée spécial mardi, mercredi et jeudi $20-$25, choix de 3 plats."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful setting in the Old City of La Prairie. Delicious fares and very pleasant staff.
I'll add this one to my favourites."}
