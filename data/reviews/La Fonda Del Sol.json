{"text":"I will admit that this review is a little bias because 1. I grew eating the food and 2. I worked here. Oh and 3. I know the crew who are fantastic. The food here is my favorite Mexican food spot in Scottsdale. What makes it a great experience is the friendliness and cleanliness of the staff and restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming to La Fonda del sol since 1992. When I lived in the Valley a meal there was a minimum once a week.  Since moving away from the area I still come to visit annually and make my first meal at La Fonda. Have had a variety of dishes but nothing beats their enchiladas; red or green, shredded beef tacos and their special chimi with chicken or beef. Their chips are light and crispy and always  served hot and fresh. Their mild salsa rivals no other! A stop here for an authentic meal which will not disappoint... Hasn't me for almost 25 years!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! I order through Grubhub but the driver decided not to do his job. The restaurant manager was very sympathetic and ensured that muy dinner to be delivered by one of his employees. My food was delicious and the quality of the service made it even better. Thank you! I will definitely come for more and I will dine in"}
{"text":"\"Yummy, & big-plate Mexican food in Scottsdale!\" 4/5  La Fonda has been one of our favorite restaurants for the last 2 years. We love going there to get some house margaritas with one or two plates of soul, comfort Mexican food. My favorite is its Shrimp Fajitas hot plate. J always like their Combo dish. Remember to pour some spicy salsa sauce on your food if you like hot stuff! :) We love the place and would recommend all our friends to try it out!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food in scottsdale. la fonda has been at this location for as long as i can remember and with good reason. The food is amazing and the staff is great. They are always so fun with my kids and remember us everytime we are there."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp, and decided this to be my first because I feel I wasted a lot of money by reading the other reviews for this restaurant and going there for lunch with my family while vacationing in Scottsdale.  We were looking for good Mexican food and read the reviews on Yelp for La Fonda Del Sol. We went there for lunch yesterday.  My Chimichanga was doughy, and tamale was like cake - very airy masa.  Very unfriendly woman delivered chips and salsa to the table, waiter was very hurried - even though there were very few people in the restaurant - and bathroom was filthy.  You can get better food and service elsewhere.  Do not waste your time and money."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I like in a Mexican restaurant.  The menu has everything you would expect to find, executed well, in an unpretentious atmosphere.  It's also missing everything I don't want in a Mexican restaurant, namely a giant corporation/theme park vibe with sterilized Mexican dishes to suit bland American palates."}
{"text":"Great chips & salsa.  Great, inexpensive Mexican food.  If you've got the craving, the place will take care of it.  And don't miss the margaritas."}
{"text":"This place has been in Scottsdale forever. I ate there a few years ago then sort of lost track of it. Returned for dinner the other night and wished I had been eating there all along. Great fish tacos. Would recommend this place. Good food good prices great service."}
{"text":"May be I went on a bad day for the kitchen, but the dishes I had was well below the average touristy level.  - the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned - the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato, half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef - the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy (no, not in a good way) - the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be better  La Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot.  But it looks like I'll have to keep on passing on by."}
{"text":"My husband loves the food, however, I don't care for it.  Service is great but something is missing."}
{"text":"After a tiring 9-hour drive from CA to AZ, we decided to dine at La Fonda del Sol as it was convenient to our hotel.  We hoped for a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere but were unlucky.  The noise volume here is extremely loud.  Looking around the narrow, booth-lined, almost full dining room, we did not spot any rowdy teens nor partying adults so it was simply general conversation. My wife ordered a chili relleno and chicken taquito; I had a shredded beef taco and a bean tostada while we both went for cheese enchiladas.  The food was served on extremely hot plates (watch your fingers!) with beans and rice but it seemed everything ran together.  We agreed that the cheese enchiladas were good but the chicken was very dry as was  the beef. My wife said she's had much better tasting chilli rellenos.  Chips and salsa came before the entrees;  chips are thin and crispy but rather dry-tasting.  Our server was efficient and very pleasant so earned the third star."}
{"text":"Just good mexican food, salsa is excellent!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place !  Food is delish and every time we have visitors I bring them there and they love it too !"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican spot in all of Arizona. I was in town visiting from California and my mind was blown. All of the food is freshly cooked! The cheese crisp is to die and everything else on the menu is absolutely amazing. I went here 3 days in a row just to be able to try as many items off of the menu as possible. For those looking for some fantastic margaritas this is your place. A muGreat for families also!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. Wonderful food, great friendly staff and just a nice atmosphere for a mexican restaurant. I return here every time I am in Scottsdale and I am always greeted with a friendly hello from the owner herself. I am not sure there is another mexican restaurant in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area that I would go to if in the mood for a good margarita and some mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been going to La Fonda Del Sol ever since I was a kid! It is one of those tiny gems you only find if you stumble upon it. In my opinion, the best Mexican food is from the tiny, non-corporate style restaurants and this place does NOT disappoint! It is delicious and it is a GREAT value. So it's a WIN WIN. The building though, could definitely use a face-lift. But other than that, give it a go!"}
{"text":"I never write bad reviews because I feel I have better things to do with my time but this place was worth writing about.  Walked in and stood up front for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us.  And when they did some lady said they didn't have room right now to  wait.  When we waited another 10 minutes I went up to her and asked if we could be seated and she simply said no and walked away!!   I told her and another waitress standing next to her that they were very rude and we wanted to go somewhere else they said okay bye.  Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Love the simplicity of this restaurant , fresh good food and great service! Never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"When in Scottsdale AZ on the corner of Scottsdale road and Shea you will find this place and not be disappointed . I had the Grande Tostada loaded with Carne Asada, Warm beans and all that goes with a Tostada. The Margareta's are top notch and not watered down. Give it a try--it's well worth the trip. Ron G"}
{"text":"I ended up at this restaurant because of a recent livingsocial.com deal.  It turned out to be a great buy and allowed me to find some \"authentic\" mexican food in Phoenix.  I was really pleased with this restaurant, and will definitely return.  For starters, the chips and salsa were excellent.  And you can have as much as you want, without being charged for an extra basket of chips.  I ordered a combo plate with tamale, taco, and cheese enchilada.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything was great.  The enchilada was my favorite part of the dish, and I will definitely stick with this next time.  The tamale was very good for a restaurant tamale, and would hold up with any home made tamale out there.  The taco was not the best.  the meat was a little overcooked do to the deep frying of the shell, but it was still good.  Just not my personal favorite.  The enchilada was very good.  You could taste the home made tortillas and the red sauce was very tasty.  Definitely recommend.  The rice was very good and authentic.  The beans were ok, but not the best I have ever had.  All in all, this is the best mexican food I have had so far in Phoenix.  It only gets 4 stars though, because I have had much better in other cities.  But so far, I have not found better in Phoenix.    This will definitely be a frequently visited spot to satisfy my craving for authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever, and while I don't ever remember eating here before, my dad assured me that I had. The place is no frills on the outside, but has a quaint charm to it on the inside.  The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.  We got a cheese crisp to start, and it was definitely a good version.  Before we could even finish it our food started coming out of the kitchen.  My sister and I both ordered Combo #10 which included a shredded beef taco and a red or green cheese enchilada, we both chose red. Like a typical Mexican restaurant, our plates came out piping hot with the standard \"Don't touch, the plate is very hot\" warning from our waiter.  First things first, I took a forkful of beans and held it up, I could see the steam rising from them, I took the bite and was immediately in heaven! These are the beans that I have been searching for!!! They were so creamy and delicious, and had just enough cheddar cheese sprinkled on top....I could have seriously just had a plate of the beans and been happy!  I took a bite of the enchilada, I really liked the enchilada sauce, it had wonderful flavor and there was not too much cheese to where that was all you could taste, it was an excellent enchilada. I then tried the taco; the shell was crisp and filled with the shredded meat, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. It was really good, the meat was not the best shredded beef I have ever had, but all the components together made it a taco that I would order again.  My dad loved the chile relleno con carne, he said it was a good version, and one of the best that he had had recently.  I decided I definitely needed to add La Fonda into my rotation, if only for the beans alone!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food not the best Service is kind  Favorite is the chimichanga with sour cream mmm also love their chips"}
{"text":"Last night I reviewed Sol, hip place with lousy food.  La Fonda is not hip but a culinary delight.  Margaritas are tequila laden lime delights.  Dos Equis served in a frosty mug.  Chips and salsa are delightful and served in non hip bowls.  Topopo is a delectable Mex  version of the Italian chopped salad.  Food is great.  Our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale and the staff has not had any plastic surgery."}
{"text":"Well, after being a long-time customer who ate here regularly, I find that in the past 6-12 months, the food has gone downhill. It seems the cook is getting lazy and the food is simply below average most times. I am very disappointed and we have started going over to Habanero's instead. Sad to see a family restaurant go downhill, but that happens after time and as the owners get older."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Good food with pretty good prices. Salsa is great. I've eaten here a few times so I've tried a few things but my fav is the chimichanga. Yummy. The servers are friendly."}
{"text":"If you like chain restaurants that have ridiculous Mexican chilis dressed with a sombrero on their head then you'll hate this place.  If you like great service, authentic Mexican food, free chips and salsa that are homemade (plenty of cilantro and peppers), then it's tough to beat La Fonda del Sol.  It's not fancy, but the service was fantastic and food dynamite.    The service was fantastic, they were busy, but both our waiter and person serving water was around twice as much as you'd find in most Mexican restaurants that charge twice as much.  A previous poster said the salsa was good.  I agree.  It comes out with hot and mild, or mix it for a good combination of both.  The dishes were well proportioned and authentic - I didn't get the usual velveeta cheese taste like you will at chain Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the #1 combo which came out with great beans and rice.  Throw in some of that hot salsa on there and you can't miss!  The bonus for the night was listening to the staff cheer during the Mexico/US soccer game.  I take it Mexico won as there was a lot of cheering.  Order a margarita or tecate and enjoy yourself here!"}
{"text":"It's kinda nice having this Mexican joint in Sdale. Very good Sonoran Mexican and nice staff. I say joint because it looks like its been around for awhile; not a prettified corporate place."}
{"text":"My favorite local Mexican food!!!   Ask to sit at one of Bridget's tables. She is the best waitress in all of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Mixed the two salsas too and it made a great combination. Plenty to eat and service was prompt."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try this place with my family. The food was canned and barely warm. The tortillas are store bought and the salsa is not homemade. Plus, the service was slowly and blah. And the manager lady had her family come through and they got served with drinks and food on the spot. My family, paying customers had to wait 45 minutes for a kids meal, taco salad and burrito."}
{"text":"La Fonda Del Sol has been in Scottsdale for forever. Yes, the place is definitely run down, however, they have good food. They have a big menu, there's something for everyone. They have fresh warm chips and salsa which I always get filled on because they are so good! Their Chimichanga's are huge and delicious! The portions here are massive so you'll definitely have food to take home. And the staff here is always super nice. Definitely try this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Chicken Fundido.  It don't care for celerey that was in it, but other than that it was good.  I also liked the beans and rice that came with it.  My picky friend who never eats beans said he thought they were good.  The salsa was a little heavy on the onions for my taste and quite mild, but mixing it with the hotter sauce made it better.  The waiter took good care of us and I have nothing to complain about there. The chips were still hot when they got to our table.  I don't see that every day.   I will go back there again."}
{"text":"Place is usually great but not this last time, went in for breakfast which ends at 11, both of us wanted to order huevos rancheros. It was 10:55 & was told we could not get  breakfast the cook had already broken down the kitchen but we could order it off the dinner menu, you get one more egg and and can chili sauce instead I'd the Rancho sauce. it only costs $7.00 more each! Seriously I asked, it's not 11 yet and you can't make us the breakfast huevos. Your sign says breakfast until 11. We sucked it up and ordered since we drive all the way there and to top it off it still came out with the ranchero sauce.  Wanted to speak with owner as I have been going there for the past 12 years but she was not in. Unfortunately it will probably be another a while before I go back or ever recommend it as the best Mexican food in Scottsdale again.  Si much for customer service. This would have never happened had there been a manager on."}
{"text":"Skip the frozen margaritas!  This rating doesn't reflect the food b/c my Mom and I just went for a cool margarita and some chips and salsa.  Margs have a strange after taste and the salsa is very bland. Also, what's up with the flies? Seriously, the waitress was walking around with a fly swatter! (I'm not kidding) Their only redeeming quality during our visit was the waitress was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. My daughter loved the buffet. Lunch was huge and great value. Can't imagine what dinner is like. Sit in Bridgette's section"}
{"text":"Food is good, not great but what shocked me the most are their prices.  Almost double anyone else of similar or better quality in town.  Habanero's, across the street is much lower priced and better food."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at La Fonda del Sol for a while now and absolutely love the food here. The service is always great. love love love. (The margaritas are great too;)"}
{"text":"La Fonda Del Sol - LOVE it! For us the best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. It is authentic. I grew up in Calif enjoying the Calif /Mex food from local friends and this  has that flavor. The FISH TACOS here are AMAZING! Fresh and NONE of that stupid sauce or added fat...these are GRILLED..they are light & tasty. The HOT chips are fantastic, mix the salsas they bring to the table & ask for a small bowl to enjoy. Really a great place...over 25 years in the same location...that tells you something especially in the Restaurant industry. When we are in Scottsdale we eat Mexican here. Good food, good value and good waitstaff. We never thought it would be hard to find good mexican food in Scottsdale, but it is...this is a great place!"}
{"text":"If you look at the front, it doesn't look like a very appetizing place to eat, but my grandma dragged me in because she wanted Mexican food, and I guess I shouldn't judge books by their covers...to a certain point.  The inside was okay, just rows of booths. I have a thing about dirty places, so I think it should have been cleaner. I didn't dare go into the bathrooms.  We were two of about five people in there. Service was pretty good. I got the guacamole tostada lunch special with rice and beans. It was sooo good. My grandma got a chicken burrito which was good too. Their chips and salsa were BOMB."}
{"text":"I LOVE their food! The queso dip is amazing as are the chimichangas and green corn tamales. I look forward to going there."}
{"text":"I don't find myself posting online reviews about restaurants all that much however this place is the exception. First off, best Mexican food I have ever eaten--hands down. The service was top notch, the ambiance had a great non-commercialized feel to it and the prices were very reasonable. If you are on the fence about this place then cast aside your worries and give it a go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Every table was taken on a Tuesday night that speaks for it self! This place is truly authentic Mexican! The salsa is the true test and it passed! awesome lots of flavor and just the right amount of heat.  The tortillas are home made, any one that knows anything about Mexican food can tell a home made tortilla. The chimichanga had huge pieces of chicken not the typical shedded bla... hole in the wall local place that's worth going. Really really good food!'nn"}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation after doing extensive research to find an authentic Mexican restaurant near our hotel. Each of us had a different mixed plate to try as much as possible. All the foods were delicious and the tortillas before the meal were a bit addicting. Ended up taking half of our meals back to the hotel for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Definitely have had much better mexican food. Not real flavorful."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant! Easy to drive by, and not much to look at, but outstanding food, service, and value."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING FOOD, BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Manager was awesome, service was amazing, had to tip the cook for the fact that we'll it was just awesome, will definitely be back anytime I'm in the area again. TY for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"Authentic, very tasty, reasonably priced, you would think your in Mexico. I will be back..."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Prices are fair and the food is consistently amazing. This place is always packed, but seems to have just one more table for us to sit as soon as we walk in, and great, fast service."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food was surpassed only by our waitress Claudia! She was everything that a restaurant wants in heir help -- knowledgeable, friendly and so stinking funny! I had the beef & chicken flautas, my daughter had the #20 carne Assada & my husband had the burrito and taco platter. We left with empty plates and full bellies! We'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade Mexican this place is a must would I highly recommend the fajitas!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, will definitely be back my next time around to Arizona. I highly recommend this restaurant for drinks and great tasting authentic Mexican food, 5 stars all the way!!!!"}
{"text":"Service so slow that I had to get up with my empty bowl and find our waitress for more chips. In my 50 yrs on this planet I've never left an unfinished margarita until now...It was more like pink ice with a plasticy aftertaste...."}
{"text":"Terrible service at the host stand. Waited ten minutes before stopping someone to put in our name. We were told we would have the next table. Left after waiting 30 more minutes. Never got seated."}
{"text":"Awesome small family owned Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale! If your looking for amazing Mexican food with great service give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a quick and delicious lunch here today and 3:00 PM was a perfect time to eat here because the restaurant was quite and empty. From the outside it looks just like it does on the inside, nothing fancy, just an older looking building. When walking in it's dimly lit and again there's nothing fancy to the decor except the celebrity lined wall as you enter the restaurant. Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union photos are on the wall. Once you get through the entrance we discovered what was waiting inside was worth the quick drive from Fountain Hills.  After putting in our order of 2 beef and cheese enchilada combo plates, our server brought us a hot basket of chips and two choices of salsa, and in small glass containers, one was pico de Gallo style and the other one deemed hot was in puree form. Both were equally delicious and the one the waiter told us was hot, was hot and had a nice spicy kick to it and yes, the more dips of the chips into the salsa the hotter my tongue got.  Within 15 minutes our food order came up and the waiter said \"be careful the plate is super hot.\" Of course what do we do when a waiter says that? We touched the plates and it was truly hot, hot, hot. Lol. I looked at the plate and saw the beef taco was loaded with beef, sliced nicely, cheese and shredded lettuce and the cheese enchilada was gooey with cheese but still firm looking. And if that wasn't enough their was a healthy portion of Spanish rice and refried beans. It had to be at least 2 nice scoops of rice on this combo plate for $9.95. BTW, lunch special is daily, so make sure you ask for it as the lunch menu has a decent variety and nicely priced, even on a Sunday.  The one thing I knew for sure was that the food was gonna be amazing, it looked amazing, was served piping hot (I have a thing about getting served hot food) and once I had a little bite of everything I found that every mouthful was mouthwatering yummy and not so salty. Everything here was just right. If you want a homey, kick back and chill place where you can eat a good, reasonably priced meal try La Fonda, it's a hidden jewel in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since high school (almost 20 years). Yikes. Such good food. A local AZ Mexican food staple."}
{"text":"Wow - we seriously loved this place.  We were just in town for the day and stopped in here.  I had the veggie fajitas and they were loaded with delicious veggies and a full boat of sides (rice beans guac sour cream cilantro etc).  My colleague had the enchiladas and loved them.  The waitress was great.  Would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in AZ friendly staff and great prices! I have tried new items every time I have come in and have always enjoyed each one. My favorite is the carne asada."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite spot of mine for over two decades. I had the WORST experience that I've ever had at any restaurant at La Fonda Del Sol. The waiter completely messed up the order and brought all incorrect food and proceeded to hand us a bill for items that we never received.   The manager should have comped our $62 check and instead, had me go through every item that we ordered and received. Not my job...   We had family in from out of town who wanted great Mexican food. We could have gone anywhere and we chose this place unfortunately.   As we were waiting, a cockroach ran across the floor. Disgusting. Never ever EVER will I return to this place."}
{"text":"La Fonda has fantastic service and the drinks are as cool as the other side of the pillow. Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. We went in on a Friday afternoon at 130pm. We sat down right away. Ordered 2 ice teas and a beer. After about 7 minutes we ordered 3 tacos. That's it. 3 tables were sat, ordered and were given their food after we ordered. Servers passed us over and over without a word. After 20 minutes we got up and said we wanted to cancel our order and pay for our drinks. Miguel took our order and apparently completely forgot to put it in. No one apologized or even said anything, they printed our check and walked away. ATTENTION OWNERSHIP.... is this how you run your restaurant??? Both of us are in the industry and know good and bad service. Needless to say we won't be back. There are plenty of other places. It's too bad our family was coming in town in 2 days and we WERE going to bring them here. I will make sure to tell EVERYONE how we were treated at La Fonda Del Sole."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Yelp we decided to try this place. The iced tea was terrible, light brown and had a weird after taste. The salsa & chips were disappointing, all I could taste on the mild salsa was thei onion but my husband said the hot salsa was better. We had a quesadilla which was okay. My son had a bean burrito with rice, he loved the burrito but generally isn't a fan of Spanish rice. My husband has the chile rellano and was disappointed. I had the Machaca Chimi & beans. Both my husband & my plate were beyond hot! The refried beans were actually bubbling! I am not exaggerating when I tell you we had to wait about 20 minutes to eat our food because it was so hot! In all fairness the chimi & beans were actually good but overall not a pleasant experience.The service was okay but not great. Sad to say we were sorely disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was great (I had the mini platter or something close to that) and it was fantastic.  There was a lot of food so I didn't finish, but definitely delicious.  The staff was good...my only issue was with how loud it was.  There were several kids in the back room, which is only separated by a curtain, so it was so loud I actually couldn't hear my date talking much of the time.  Overall...good place to go!"}
{"text":"La Fonda Del Sol is the perfect Mexican restaurant. It has everything I have ever looked for in a Mexican restaurant. Absolutely amazing food and great service where the waiter is super helpful.  We started with the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips actually came out super warm and in a huge basket. They were nice and thick and crispy. They bring you two kinds of salsa, one hot and one medium. Both were great.  Cadillac Margarita ($11.95 large) - Once we heard they had a margarita made with Patron we decided we had to try it. We ordered one to share and the waiter mentioned we could get a large for only $2 more. Why not! This margarita was really nice and strong, not for those who like super sweet margaritas. 4/5  Supreme Nachos with Chicken ($8.95) - I was going to get the large nachos and the waiter suggested I go for the small, since the large apparently feeds 2-3 people. All I can say is THANK GOD he did because the small size was massive and I couldn't even finish that! These nachos were the nachos I dream about getting every time I order nachos when I eat out and am usually disappointed. They were absolutely covered in cheese and there was no chip without something on it. The beans were mixed in to the cheese to create an amazing gooey spread. It also came with chicken and scoops of guacamole and sour cream. Honestly, these were in the top 3 best nachos I've ever had. And if you know me, you know how much I love nachos. I would highly recommend. 5/5  Fajita Burrito Dinner ($15.95) - The husband ordered a chicken fajita burrito and the waiter mentioned that if he wanted rice and beans on the side, he could get the Shrimp Fajita Burrito Dinner and get chicken instead of shrimp. Does this waiter read minds?? That was exactly what my husband had wanted and he was so happy to get that. As soon as he bit into this burrito his eyes lit up and he said \"oh my god this is the best burrito I've ever had\". I was like yea yea let me eat my amazing nachos. But finally I got curious at his enthusiasm and asked for a bite of chicken. HOLY CRAP. This was the most flavorful, juiciest, grilled chicken I have ever had in my life. It was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. After that bite I was so jealous and wanted that dish for myself! 5/5  I am so sad we don't live in Arizona because I would literally eat here once a week. And if we ever come back, I am running to eat here again."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in Scottsdale! Food and Salsa amazing! Service phenomenal! Great prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here because I wanted authentic greasy stick to your ribs Mexican food. Unfortunately all I got was the greasy part.   I ordered a combo enchilada and taco platter. The shredded beef was dry and the whole plate was just too salty. It came with an ample helping of beans and rice, which were tasty but nothing special.  However I do have to agree that this place has great chips and salsa. And the wait staff is very generous with them.   I just wish the rest of the meal had lived up to the chips."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  My wife and I were happy to see they were open New Years Day for dinner.  We had flown in earlier in the day.  We were seated right away and got our drinks fast.  The place was busy but we were not ignored.  We got a sampler ala cart plate because we were ready to try some authentic Mexican food rather than Northwest Mexican food.  We had a tamale and chili relleno.  Both were good.  Good flavor and cheesey but not too much.  Of course the tamale doesn't compare to Bobby Flay's tamale at his restaurant but this was a good one.   I think next time we will have to get a margharita and try some other items."}
{"text":"Customer for 20 years.  Never will go near the place again.  On Saturday nite, Management allowed a drunken, roudy, over the top obnoxious, loud group of young men and women ruin everyone's dinner!! Manager laughed at me when I complained!!"}
{"text":"Well, it's not bad, but it's pretty darned pedestrian. The rice was flavorless, beans taste like they came out of a can. The much anticipated carnitas tamale was smothered in a run of the mill red enchilada sauce that totally masked any flavor it may have had.   I found it also be a little pricey for what it is. Not outrageous by any means, but barely one step up from Taco Bell, shouldn't cost three steps up.  On the plus side, the guacamole was excellent. garnishes of cheese and black olive slices were a very nice touch, and a perfect contrast against the tangy guac. The chips were great, very thin, crispy, and served scorching hot. I also like the chunky fresh tasting salsa. (There is a second mini carafe of a hotter version which you can blend to your desired level of heat). Overall though, our entrees reminded me more of the frozen mexican \"tv dinners\" that my Mom would heat up for us in the oven than anything I'd expect to be served in a restaurant. Satisfying, but lowest common denominator generic!"}
{"text":"To set the record straight, the service here was great.  The food...not so much.  Started off with some chips and salsa...pretty standard.  Had two different types of salsas...one hot and one mild.  Had two carnitas tacos, which came with rices and beans.  The rice and beans were good...beans were pretty rich.  The carnitas were pretty dry, but the worst part was the tacos were topped with this even more dry cabbage, onion, cilantro mixture.  I had to add a lot of salsa to make the tacos interesting.  I also tried the shrimp burro...aka a big shrimp burrito.  This actually wasnt that bad...pretty simple with some nice grilled shrimp and fajita-esque veggies.  The last thing I tried was the beef enchiladas.  The beef seemed to be machaca and it was tender.  The problem with the dish was that the enchilada sauce was extremely rich...it tasted like a mixture between velveeta cheese and hormel chili, which is one of my favorite tailgating foods...not my favorite enchilada topping.    With the number of mexican restaurants in scottsdale and phoenix...there is no need for me to come back here."}
{"text":"Ya know this place is ok in a pinch if you're in the area and want a quick lunch as in in their Buffett, which is one of the only Mexican Food restaurants in the valley that still offers one!  Beef Fajita meat has a good marinated flavor! Three stars because it's not the best I've ever had, far from the worst, just somewhere in the middle, definitely edible....I'm just a Mexican food fanatic, and certainly know the best places in the Valley to go.  This place doesn't make my top 10."}
{"text":"This place has terrific Mexican food and their salsa is fabulous! My only complaint is that on our most recent visit we were waiting in the tiny bar area for what felt like an eternity and the woman would not make us drinks! It was odd. Once we were seated our server was awesome and told us about some cool local bars."}
{"text":"If La Fonda Del Sol existed in New York City, there would be a line around the block waiting to get seats. The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blasé indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.  Well, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.  So, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what it's all about.  Yeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.  When it's all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza (HA! HAHAHA!) and Oregano's (BAHH! HAHA!) while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if you're a New Yorker like me, you're not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow; go get some Mexican."}
{"text":"just ok food I got the Burro is was stewed pork in gravy placed inside a cold flour not home made tortilla.  the chips and salsa were ok the salsa was not hot.  I drank my first beer no one asked me if i needed another.  I was dinning alone I guess I wasnt worth the trouble I felt like I was sort of an afterthought."}
{"text":"Just discovered this neighborhood treasure.  This family owned and operated business prides itself on knowing its clientle and every time my husband and I visit, they remember our usual drink order -- and have remembered almost from the first visit -- and have it ready for us the moment we sit down.  My favorite dish is the tamales, which are something I learned to love in my home state of Texas, and I love, love, love La Fonda Del Sol's version of home style tamales.    The food is reasonably priced, generous portioned; the wait staff is friendly, and service is prompt.   I judge a Mexican place by the quality of its salsa, and this place wins big on the salsa.  One is mild, but really flavorful, and the other has a great level of heat.  The chips are great.  In all the ways a Mexican restaurant should be good, this one is great."}
{"text":"Never been here. Just tried to get a menu to place an order for an office.  I was told there is no menu on the web.  And that they can't fax me one.  So.... they don't want take out business??  He said I should come in. Then what - call back to the office for the orders of everyone."}
{"text":"Great food & service. Bridget is the BEST waitress!  A group of us go here for lunch about once a month and she knew our orders by heart after our 2nd visit. Would highly recommend the topopo salad and the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, some of the best I've had. I'd recommend this as a casual place to eat, not a date night atmosphere. My husband & I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Chips and salsa best I've ever had.  Enchiladas were amazing and authentic.  Mole sauce was perfect.  Kids loved their bean burritos.  Hole in the wall place but just gave it an authentic look. Prices were about $15 for a huge plate of food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to La Fonda for decades. It was good in the beginning and has been consistently a good experience during that entire time.  The service is super friendly and efficient.  The food is good, starting with the fresh chips and salsa.  The margaritas seem especially tasty after a hard day at work.  I have had several of the entrees, and they are all good.  However, I have a confession to make:  I can't stop ordering the tapopo salad.  It is so good with the marinated chicken, fresh avocado, leafy greens, cheese, etc.  The topping is the simple but delicious oil and vinegar dressing."}
{"text":"First time we came to this place and have to say it was great! Green corn tamales were great and the pollo fundido is yummy. Check this place out if you have a chance."}
{"text":"This is one of our most favorite local Mexican restaurants. I don't think you will be disappointed in anything that you order! We have gone there with many family and friends and everyone is impressed with the food. My favorite is the Super Tostada, the fajitas and the guacamole. This will be a favorite place if you check it out!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is is top notch, always attentive. World's best fajitas, and huge portions. They never let your drinks or chips go empty. This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, and I will continue to come to."}
{"text":"Came here because Oregano's was packed on a Saturday night.  I wonder how many of their customers are in the same boat.  I was initially craving Mexican food anyway, so I didn't care.    The service is awesome, the beer was so cold it was almost icy (read: awesome) and the salsa is yummy yummy.  I ordered the specialty chimichanga and my mom got rolled tacos.  The plates were hu-hu-hu-huge.  And can I just say that cream cheese makes everything better, especially chimichangas.  YUM.    Not the best Mexican joint I have ever been to, but definitely decent enough to visit again (for the locals)."}
{"text":"Just because a place has been there awhile does not mean you will have a good dining experience. Yes, the chips are free and warm, but they are very thin and if you are dipping, most will break in half. Fonda uses that dumb salsa in a jar style which still makes no sense (Give us a bowl of salsa). My main course was a watery, messy disaster and the owner who I will call \"mama\" could barely defend her chile relleno after I called her out on the nasty food. The coating on the tiny pepper fell off and somehow it looked like my plate got flooded with pepper juice or an unknown liquid, possibly from the watery beans (see pics). Mama did shoot back a comment, but never full stood at our table and chatted after she got a negative response from me over the standard \"How is everything\" question. Keep serving up that slop mama and believing your Mexican food is good, but the smart diners will go elsewhere for a better experience. If I wanted soup, I would have ordered it mama!"}
{"text":"The food itself wasn't all that bad, however the staff was less than stellar. I actually ordered food to go there and the entire time I was waiting, I witnessed the staff having personal conversations that should have taken place outside of the work place. The staff wasn't rude, but they didn't seem to take many things seriously and I witnessed them not really paying much attention to many of their patrons.   So for the food, not bad at all. The service could use some help."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It looks like its been around for years, and the food is pretty good. Its hard to find good mexican food in Scottsdale. I am from Texas and let me tell you, thats where some good mexican food is at. However, La Fonda is pretty good too (not comparable) but good.   Our group ordered a bunch of stuff, among which was the machaca burro, bean and cheese (boring but good!), green corn tamale, and enchiladas. Everything was great, a little much on the cheese but all in all I would keep coming back!   Oh! best part! 2.75 for a pint of Shock Top? Whaaat? Its not even happy hour. We got a pitcher. The glasses were frozen as was the pitcher which was cool. They didn't have oranges for some of our party though, but the server was really nice and got some from the kitchen.  Prices range from about 10-15 per ontray and drinks are reasonably priced! Check this place out!! I've lived in Scottsdale for years and can't believe I just went now.   PS Regular salsa is not that good :/ Chips are!"}
{"text":"We are here weekly, favorites are tacos, tostadas, burros and flautas.  Red and green Chile are both good.  Give the soups a try too.  Like I said, we eat here weekly to get our mex fix."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are great here. But as I read the reviews before my meal arrived I noticed a common complaint. The food being cold. So, I normally judge a Mexican food place off the salsa and chips and since they were great, I figured the cold food must of been just  An off day. Well my food comes and it looks great. I ordered the green corn tamale, shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada with rice and beans. The rice and beans were good the taco was OK the beef really didn't have much flavor but it was deep-fried shell with lettuce tomato and cheese. My cheese enchilada was completely cold the inside the cheese was still cubed not even melted. And my green corn tamale which I could tell if it was cooked would've been probably good,but it was completely raw Massa. Super bummed. I was hoping this would be my new Mexican spot"}
{"text":"Looks dicey on the outside but the food is good and authentic.  Coming from an east coast guy."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time a few years ago and then I slowly forgot about it as I got into a new relationship. We decided to pick up takeout because I was craving Mexican. Oh boy, I'm so glad because it's so good! Yes, I'm eating as I'm writing this. I remembered how I always mixed the hot salsa with the mild to get the perfect salsa and they sell pitchers of margaritas! My boyfriend enjoyed his meal, so we're definitely coming back. He even said he'll bring his friends. It's one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall joints! Oh, by the way... I'm eating the chicken fundido! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorite little hole in the walls.  Staff is friendly and the salsa is amazing."}
{"text":"We tried this place while visiting AZ and the Scottsdale area. We were not disappointed.  As good as it gets. Big chicken quesadilla, could feed 2 people, my son enjoyed it very much. Wonderful enchiladas with bean and rice. Great friendly service, despite the fact that we were on the late side, they were not very busy. Thank you yelper for the great advise!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever. Hands down. BEST salsa I've ever had and everything I've had is so incredibly good. Chimichanga's, Fajita's, and Enchilada's! You cannot go wrong. I'd give 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for years and it's always been the same, authentic delicious Mexican food that you just don't get everywhere. Roman, the head waiter, is always prompt, courteous, and in a delightful mood like he has always been for the years he's worked there, and being a engineer I know the old cliche is true \"good help is hard to find\" thanks for the years of great food at a great price!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty darn good \"come as you are\"  Sonoran Mexican food joint. The food quality and portion size is good; chunky chicken in the enchilada, machaca was well seasoned and robust, tap dos Equis Amber was super cold in a frosty mug. Made us happy for $25."}
{"text":"Another fantastic dinner! Never disappointed here! Seriously, the best Mexican food! Awesome and quick service! My favorite is the green chicken enchilada...mmm! I'm stuffed!"}
{"text":"Had a green chili burrito enchilada style, beef taco, rice and beans.  Pretty authentic for the most part, could use a little more seasoning but flavor was pretty good.  The price IS a little high, in my opinion and the salsa is fresh but lacking in seasoning.  Staff friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The only place to go for Mexican food. I'll drive out of my way to come here. Cannot ever get enough of the salsa. The BEST in town."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were referred here by a local Scottsdale resident (since we are from California) we tried it. I actually did not like it at all... which is very rare considering I love Mexican food. I was really disappointed I got an enchilada, tostada, taco combo with rice and beans. The beans and rice had no flavor, and the mild salsa had too much onion. I asked for a shredded beef enchilada and for some reason it had celery in it, I dont like celery at all so I just picked them out. My boyfriend didnt care for it either. The best part of this place was the hot red sauce (not mild) with the chips. The waiters never came to our table and the bathroom was horrible."}
{"text":"Great service here food is decent but I've had better. ..complimentary salsa was really good. .happy with my visit"}
{"text":"Great experience my first time there. Prompt service and waiter was very friendly and attentive to our large crowd. I ordered the steak chimichanga and the meat was amazing, wasn't greasy surprisingly since it's deep fried! This is definitely my go to spot and worth my drive from chandler."}
{"text":"There menudo is the best of Scottsdal and north phoenix. Thier chorizo is wonderful! I grew up on the border and I am so glad they are close to me!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the lunch buffet on this re-visit. There were not too many choices but the food was good and the service was very efficient and friendly. A previous visit was  bit disappointing but this was probably because I came way after the lunch peak at that time. I met Rand H. and Robyn N. here at 11 am this time around, so the food was freshly prepared and plentiful. Three and a half stars, rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"Good food, not a fancy place but it is clean and had good food.   You will not be disappointed.  With so many options in the area they would not have survived for so many years without good food.  Give them a try.   Lots of regular customers."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Old school. Not pretentious at all except for the two middle age \"Scottsdale Ladies\" with their big hair, sunglasses and hats. Also, at least when we visited, loved that they had ALL MALE WAITORS. Not because they were pretty to look at ( they were) but because guys just kick ass at waiting tables, especially at Mexican restaurants.   And food served on HOT plates.   They nailed it.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"For the authentic taste of a good hearty Mexican meal, this is my go-to spot. They have an abundance of vegetarian options which are surprisingly hard to find at Mexican restaurants around the valley. I almost always opt for the nachos because their jalapenos are awesome.   The chips are amazing: crispy, not too greasy, and perfectly thin. But the salsa? Oh my god. SO good!   Another rad thing about this place: the margarita pitchers. Makes for a great time with friends. I'm a classic margarita kind of gal so I didn't venture too far out of my comfort zone, but they definitely gave me a good buzz.  The kicker here is the service. The family that owns this place is so nice they warm your heart!"}
{"text":"Passed by so many times and never tried it til just recently when the Mexican Craving kicked in!   Very tasty huge portions, can definitely share an entree with two people. I thought the refried beans were a little too salty. The service was slightly slow but that may be due to the fact that this place was busy. Our waitress, Claudia was very nice and funny. The busser refilled our chips without asking, that was nice.   Overall it's a great little place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a Phoenix native and I take Mexican food very seriously. I very rarely order red chili when I go out because I love it so much and am usually left sad and disappointed. I'm also an avid taco lover. I'm 7 months pregnant so I would like them every day. The red chili I had at La Fondas today almost brought a tear to my eye. The beef in the chili and the taco was tender and flavorful. Rice and beans yummy. Salsa was ah mazing. My hubby had the fundido and barely spoke as he was so engrossed in the deliciousness. Not close to our Anthem home but I'll go back any opportunity I get."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great! Some of the best chorizo con huevo I've had in the valley.   Salsa was good and spicy!"}
{"text":"Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking."}
{"text":"I hate to have to do this but the last several of our visits have been lackluster. The food quality seems to have declined and the service has too. Last time we were in they had one woman seating, taking orders, bringing the food, refilling drinks, cleaning the tables and checking people out - needless to say it was a slow go. A few years ago we loved this place and now we are on the fence....."}
{"text":"This place used to be great but not sure what happened in just the last year.. you're better off going to macayos"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp app.  It was awesome...literally like a hole in the wall joint, which usually means good food. I got the chicken chimi and my husband got the burrito.  All dinners come with rice and beans and I think most entrees in the $10-14 range.  Portions are huge, plates are extremely hot and the beers are cold.  Service was a little slow but no biggie, we weren't in a hurry.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service. Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'd like to write a review on the food, but I can't get by with the piss poor customer service. After sitting as a party of 6 for over an hour, the manager ignored us, our waiter was clueless, and we left. The manager chuckled it off as a lost table, but he lost many future tables and any recommendation. It wasn't busy enough to justify that sort of wait, and there's never an excuse to have a manager with that mistreatment of customers."}
{"text":"Enjoying lunch at this long established Mexican restaurant. Combo plate chicken chimy hot and mild salsas with fresh chips."}
{"text":"Growing up in the Southwest I can honestly say that I am to Mexican food what Casey Anthony is to scandalous whoring.  With that being said, La Fonda Del Sol can most aptly be described as better than average... more than adequate....above par...and a step above decent. The chips and salsa were very good but the pollo fundito had way too much cream cheese. The side of refried beans and rice was perfect. At many Mexican restaurants, beans and rice are a throwaway. An afterthought. Not here. These sides truly stole the show. One aspect of my visit that was very disappointing was the fact that they don't serve Tecate in a can.  The can is necessary for one to smear bit's of lime, lime juice and salt around the surface of said can to truly appreciate the wonders of a perfect beer on a hot summer evening, with the beading, condensation dripping down the side of the freezing cold can and chunks of acidic lime flesh washing down the smooth, light hoppiness that is indicative of a good Mexican cerveza."}
{"text":"This place is always packed & for good reason...from the fresh, tasty salsa to the outstanding sizzling fajitas to the tacos, burritos, to the chimis to the amazing margaritas to the friendly, homey service...this place has it all!!! I've lived in Scottsdale for over 40 years & have eaten in dozens of Mexican food places...La Fondas is, by far, the most delicious! You can taste & see the freshness at LaFondas...If you're in the mood for made-from-scratch delicious food where the owners appreciate your business, this is the place for you! Annamarie R."}
{"text":"Not much on atmosphere, but don't worry about that.  Some of the best Mexican food that I have ever had.  Portions are plentiful and the service was great.  You MUST go here!!!!!  I have the Chicken Fajita, my wife had a guacamole tostada and a chicken tamale, and our friend had a shrimp tostada.  Everyone was raving!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The four of us came for the Buffett Lunch today and the food was generally good. It was nice to finally meet, Rand H who organized and hosted the lunch, along with fellow Yelp'ers Robyn N and Arlin B.  We met around 11:00, as the place was just opening.  I've have taken several photos of the buffet area. Its on the left as you just come in, near the bar.  The selections were pretty wide, including two types of soup. Everything was hot, as you would imagine it should be.  Buffets can be a difficult business.  You have to constantly gauge which items are being consumed the most and prepare the kitchen accordingly. For the most part, I believe La Fonda got it right and stayed on top of things.  As for the food, it was somewhat basic. But as they say in Yelp-ese, it was A-OK.   The Chicken and Steak Fajitas, the cooked Ground Beef, the Shredded Pork, Cheese  Enchiladas and Chili Rellenos were all good, though not memorable. Our table agreed the cooked chicken breast was the weakest and brought down most of our ratings.  The tab, with a soft drink ran $11.93 before tip, but including taxes."}
{"text":"So the hubs and I moved here three weeks ago and on our first weekend here we wandered by La Fonda but the wait on a Friday night was just something we weren't in the mood for (45 minutes -1 hour)...we learned quickly this was the norm as it wasn't the first place we tried but the second with the same wait time....  Sooooo, we decided to give it a shot on a random Sunday around 5ish and hopefully find our go to Mexican joint in the neighborhood.   The chips are fresh and crisp and PERFECT, the salsa was on point as well. I appreciate they brought out a spicy and mild. I found the perfect combo to be 1 part spicy to 3 parts mild .  The queso dip isn't something we will order again. It tasted like straight velveeta but it came with what I think we're fried flour tortillas and those were the best part of the app.  My husband and I both ordered the la Fonda special chimichanga (chicken, cream cheese, jalapeño cheese) don't get me wrong, it was ok, just not something I'll order again. However, the defried beans ... Yes please! Wow wow wow.  All in all I'm not impressed but since it's less than 5 minutes away i know I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"This place puts the \"meh\" in Mexican. I guess I expected more because it looks like a small, authentic family-run restaurant, but everything we had was fairly bland, and the service fairly lackluster for a Sunday at 11:30. No one seemed to want to be there, and in retrospect neither did we."}
{"text":"We love this place, so much so that I kinda want to give it 1 star to deter you. Valley-raised, this is my 2nd favorite Mexican food restaurant here. Chips are steaming hot and cheese enchilada will have you wishing for another. Note: no brunch or lunch buffets on Sunday."}
{"text":"Delicious cheese enchiladas! Also great salsa and I enjoyed their chips and guacamole."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I get take out from here on a weekly basis.  If I have company that want to go to authentic local food (nothing fancy), then I head to La Fonda.  Easy to get in.  Nothing fancy, but good food and good service.  Their servers have been there a while and always remember me which is a nice touch.  Their tamales are made fresh and are DELICIOUS.  Their salsa is fresh and yummy.  The place is \"old Scottsdale\" for sure, but you will enjoy it.  There are always a lot of people eating, but I never seem to have to wait."}
{"text":"Pretty descent buffet. Good quality food. Chicken fajitas were bomb :) so were  the cheese enchiladas"}
{"text":"LOVE the food here!!!!  The queso comes with the most amazing crisps!!!!    Fantastic service and people. The food no matter what you order always comes out tasting outstanding. If you are in the mood for quality food, great people, and a fun local scottsdale spot this is your place."}
{"text":"I literally just called this restaurant to see if they had a truck. The lady that answered the phone proceeded, in a rude tone I might add, to say \"no,no,no\" before I could even finish my sentence. As I was formulating my follow up question, she hung up! I was looking to have them cater for an office event for over 300 people, but based on that first impression I would rather give money to an establishment that values GOOD customer service.   After the above review was posted the owner reached out to me directly and was apologetic. I truly appreciate him taking the time to reach out me. Andrew you're awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I have never left a review as quick as this. I ordered from here for the first time through GrubHub & couldn't be more disappointed. It was late. It was cold. It was missing items and 1 of the items I did receive was inedible. It was extremely overpriced as well. They charged me $3 for the smallest thing of guacamole and $4.50 for a fish taco that had nothing special about it and was plain. I will never order from here again and was so bummed because of other reviews which had me excited to try it"}
{"text":"What else is there to say but that LaFonda is the best in Mexican food! Each time we visit the Phoenix area LaFonda Del Sol is a must stop location. The service is friendly and punctual and you cannot go wrong regardless of the meal. If you're a snooty type, the ambiance may not be your speed. In the end, the line out the door waiting for a table tells the story."}
{"text":"It has been 3 days since we dined at LaFonda Del Sol and I can't remember much about the food except the chips and salsa (which were very good!).   The ambiance is hole in the wall-esque. The food and service were obviously not too bad because I would have remembered that but also not so awe-inspiring that I have vivid recall about what we ate.   The concierge did not lead us totally astray but it is safe to say that the restaurant is eminently forgettable."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Mexican restaurant been there forever the manager knows every customer by name. I give it 3 stars because it's nothing special but 5 stars for a place to go get a good Mexican meal. My bill was a little high for what I had and later I found that I was over charged just a mistake that I hope they will correct. No one was out to cheat me of 15 bucks. This place was packed and is always packed from what I hear"}
{"text":"I simply adore this place. At first glances, this place can get over looked. I didn't even realize there was a restaurant here until a friend recommended I check it out.  The outside has very charming decorations. The inside could use a facelift, but putting appearance aside, the food here is good. The chips and salsa are delicious and the chimichanga was delicious as well. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite \"authentic\" Mexican food!  I've  been going to La Fonda (original location on Scottsdale Road/Curry) for over 45+ years  The food is wonderful! I love the green corn tamales! My husband loves the MaryLou. My grown kids like  chicken enchiladas with green sauce!  And all of us LOVE the fresh, hot chips and fabulous salsa!"}
{"text":"This place is located near where a friend of mine worked and we started going at least once month for lunch.  We've continued that same pace for well over a decade.  Therefore, I've probably had more meals here than any other restaurant in the Phoenix area, besides it's close to where I live.  We like there food, service and atmosphere; although it is more of a dive than an upscale place, but I like it.  Lunch times can get very busy but the food arrives fast, the staff is friendly and the food consistently good.  This is just your regular Phoenix Mexican food, but good.  Whenever we go to another Mexican restaurant we always end up saying \"it's not as good as La Fonda Del Sol\" (with only one exception, but one in a completely different category - Los Reyes de la Torta).  As soon as you sit down they bring some of their wonderful homemade tortilla chips and two different homemade salsas; one hot (as in spicy) and one chunkier and not so hot.  Although I know I'm always going to \"suffer\" if I eat too much of their hot salsa, I simply can't resist and always ask for more chips and hot salsa; and then my intestines aren't happy with me because of all the \"hot.\"  I'd say that over 95% of our visits have been for lunch, so we always order from their lunch specials.  They do offer a wonderful, all you can eat; lunch buffet which I've tried and is very good, but since I don't eat large portions it is sort of lost on me.  Besides I simply love their lunch \"Cheese Relleno.\"  My friend almost always orders their lunch \"Taco Salad.\"  They have very good margaritas which we occasionally have.    Recently I've had several friends in from out-of-town that wanted Mexican food, so I've always spouted off several places we could go, but always include this \"little Mexican dive.\"  Every one of them has always selected this place claiming that the dives have the best food.  I tell them there are more upscale places we could go to but there response is \"we're buying and we don't want to spend much money on you (ha).\"  They've all loved it.  We are regulars in there.  Absolutely a 5-star \"dive\" wonderful Mexican restaurant.  Please, please, please - La Fonda Del Sol, never go out of business."}
{"text":"For that Mexican craving that no other  food type can satisfy, La Fonda reigns supreme. There is nothing upscale or arty about the plate they set in front of you, but it's solid, reliable and essential on occasion. My two favorites are the green corn tamale dinner and their cheese chile relleno. Cheese crisp or hot buttered flour tortilla also key players on sidelines. They've been around the Valley in a couple different locations since the '70's, geez just go."}
{"text":"Hi there,   I LOVE this place !!!!!!!!    The waiters have been there forever  and are always friendly and helpful and knowledgeable !   THE food is consistent and fresh and not out of a can.     My nephew 12 years old said,  \"this is the best Mexican food I ever tasted\".   He goes out with his parents all the time and thinks this tastes best. I go there at least 3 times a week and everyone I take makes it their favorite.  Peacock"}
{"text":"We just stopped for dessert...and the fried ice cream was excellent.  From reading reviews, and what I have heard from long timers, and the many people coming in for dinner, the food is excellent.  However, the dining area is definitely the \"dive\" that someone else described in their rating.  I think if the owner updated/refreshed the interior, they would have a gold mine."}
{"text":"Bridget was absolutely amazing! Outstanding service and amazing food. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite spots I've been to so far in scottsdale. Very good authentic food. Staff was great. The chips and salsa are fantastic and the food is soooo good."}
{"text":"This place is not far from our home yet we had never been. We were hungry for Mexican food and the yelp reviews weren't bad so we gave it a try.  They were busy on Friday night but we were seated quickly. Our server (failed to get her name) was terrific. She helped us navigate the menu in terms of what were big sellers and her personal favorites. She put warm chips and fresh salsa on the table. The salsas were fresh and good.  Portions were large and they were very accommodating for a special order from my son (hold the tomatoes, hold the onions). I ordered a guacamole tostada and a bean burrito served enchilada style. It was way too much food. Apparently they have a buffet at lunch time and I'd like to try it as I have three sons who scarf most meals these days.  We'll go back - sorry I hadn't tried it earlier."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular, but moved away which was why I was happy to come back a few days ago. I really wish i could give this place 4 stars, but the lack of good customer service won't allow me to. Not getting my order right is kind of expected as we see the wait staff rush around the place like crazy. If they could slow it down a bit, they'd be able to get things  right the first time so that everyone in the same party can eat at the same time. I ordered a chicken and spinach enchilada and only got spinach. Boo. Then they took it back and brought it out super fast with chicken on the side. Plus, the cheese dip came late and with the rest of the meal. I dont care to go back for a long time."}
{"text":"Excellent! The best \" old school\" Mexican food we've found since moving here. The chicken fajitas were delicious."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years. This past weekend we decided to try it. It was obvious that if you are a regular, you are treated quite well. The servers knew the names of the customers and treated them like they were part of the family. Our server acted like we were from outer space. In fairness I did not see him interact with any other customers, so perhaps he was the issue. The food was good, but there are definitely better Mexican food places in town. Perhaps if this was our normal spot, or we had one of the other servers I would be inclined to try it again. But, it's not and they weren't so we'll probably stick with our usual places."}
{"text":"Meh, very mediocre. Ordered a shrimp taco. Pieces of griiled shrimp ( fortunately was tasty) and a flour tortilla with a small mound of shaved lettuce. Need I say more. The chips are processed ones."}
{"text":"I've been searching a long time for amazing Mexican food in Scottsdale and finally found it!!! Wow, wow, wow!! Delicious and fabulous and a new craving! Even when I order it through uber eats it's delicious! Best Mexican food around!"}
{"text":"In love!  Cheese crisp is old school divine!  I did easy cheese and it was perfect. The 2 salsas at the table were a perfect blend of spicy and that great chunkier homemade salsa. I am in love with this place!  I like old school but need it to be good and not too sauce/cheese heavy handed. And, my waiter Andrew has obviously been here a while-which I like. Tells me he believes in this place. Finished my order with sour cream beef enchilada. There were chunks  of been in it. Seriously, love this place. Thank you Yelp for not steering me wrong."}
{"text":"We went there valentines night I guess they weren't expecting that many people and I also think they were short staffed. Our server was Andrew hope I'm getting the name right. Young guy with brown hair and glasses absolutely amazing. For how slammed that poor guy was customer service his attitude and his attention to detail was outstanding. The queso is amazing I would just say to serve it though with regular chips not a fan of the flour crisps. Their chips and salsa are probably the best in the valley except for maybe los dos molinos but that is very far from where we live. son got the Carne asada wow the meet is so tender and great flavor. Other son bean burrito  fine husband Carnitas very good. My only negative feedback is I ordered the chili relleno and it was definitely not the best I've had. The batter used to coat it is very odd it's like a crusty omelette s/b fluffy and soft and the chile itself inside was too crispy it should be cooked thoroughly & easy to cut w/ a fork. However the ranchero sauce is very good maybe they can work on the other 2 issues. But not everything can be perfect so I'm OK with it. Next time I think I'll order the beef hard taco that's my other go to. I love that they serve Coke products I mean who serves Pepsi products anymore? I will continue to go here with my family and each time I'll try something different until I figure out what my favorites are"}
{"text":"This place is a great little hole in the way - while the food was good (not the best), BUT the service is why it gets the three stars. The place got busy but so does every other restaurant on a Saturday night and their servers just couldn't hang. I would only come back if it's an off hour of the day."}
{"text":"A bit drizzly on Thurs. when we ended up here it was a bit before 3 the place was empty maybe 2 other customers while we were there. We were greeted by a nice lady who asked how many I replied 2 1/2 in Spanish she replied in to sit where we pleased. I wish it would have been nice out that day their patio looked like fun....maybe another day for happy hour yeah. My daughter loved the fish tank I just hope the catfish wasn't for eating later!! Yikes it was way too big for the tank and looked a bit out of place with the other goldfish.  Hot chips and 2 carafes of salsa came out w our waiter one hot and one not. YAY just how I like it!! I liked to mix them here to get the perfect amount of heat I like it was yummy the chips could have been a tad better some were a little too toasted. I had a chile relleno lunch their beans and rice were great no complaints the egg on the relleno was a little too peppery for me but I dont like pepper too much yet I still cleaned my plate. My mom had an enchilada she ate it up quick and the kid's plate was so cute w a mini taco my daughter liked that she could put the not hot salsa in the taco and eat it! =) Quick and very pleasant service. Could use a little dusting pics coming soon."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, has an enclosed patio, the buffet is good, reasonable prices. Will return. But some of the enchilada dishes are a bit runny but still good."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here for a work lunch and it was a huge hit! Everything we had was absolutely great! We ordered the queso dip & guac as appetizers (they forgot to give us the guac and I didn't realize until I got back to the office) but we weren't disappointed after we tried the queso :)  Our lunches ranged from shrimp salads, to enchiladas, to fajitas and we really enjoyed everything!  We also ordered the sopapillas and churros for dessert and they were enjoyed as well! The churros were a bigger hit though!  Portions are really big and prices are great. I'd highly recommend checking this place out!  Their salsa's are also really good!!"}
{"text":"You would think this place is actually in Mexico given how long I had been meaning to try it.  I can only say, I should have gone sooner.  Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version.  I tried the green chile and loved it.   Decor is nothing to write home about, but not a complete dive either.  Service was excellent.  I actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food, but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale.  Dinners run about $12 on average.  Lunch about $7.  They also have breakfast.  On the bad side, they apparently have a lunch buffet.  God only knows how big my ass will get knowing that tidbit of information.  Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing."}
{"text":"I liked our meal at La Fonda Del Sol.  Two kinds of salsa, fresh chips, and really good food.  For comparison, I got the Flamingo Dinner and my wife got the Shredded Beef Chimichanga.  The difference is rice and beans, and even though the rice and beans were good, I don't think it was worth the extra money.  Does this mean that the full plate should be cheaper or the chimi should be $1 more?  I don't know, I guess it depends what the competition is charging.  Although the food was good and the service was friendly, we got there around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night and the place needed a really good cleaning.  I was kicking plastic drink lids and other refuse that was under my table, so I think the place needs to be swept a bit more frequently.  I was also a little surprised at how quiet it was in there because some other businesses seemed to be busier.  But that's okay, we had a good meal and I would go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"We ended up in the neighborhood on a weekday (lunch time) and we stopped by La Fonda del Sol. We went for the buffet, and what a nice surprise!  They had me at 'menudo and cocido' : ) I must not be very picky for menudo anymore, I thought the menudo and the buffet itself were pretty decent. There are not many options for dishes but they had a very good selection, and options for many ways of eating. I think vegetarians can enjoy rice, beans, chile relleno and enchiladas. They had chicken and beef fajita (hubby liked the chicken better, said beef was a little tough, but you would not expect the best meat on a reasonably priced buffet...). They also had shredded meat and ground beef. Plus some chicken in red chile sauce that was very good too. I was not so fond of the chips this time, I remember them lighter and these ones were more like 'tostitos'... Service was nice and friendly, I did not get the name of the young lady that served us. Overall, great experience and hope to be back for my 'menudo fix'  Menudo - very good ratio of meat to hominy. Cocido, big chunks of meat, too lean for my taste, but at least good amount of meat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite kind of Mexican place: divey with character (if that's not a redundant term). To have a place like this in Scottsdale is a rarity.   Ditto to the previous reviews about excellent food and excellent salsa. The salsa is especially impressive, being the chunky flavor-packed kind that I love. Our entrees were both less than 8 bucks a pop."}
{"text":"This is a pretty traditional Mexican restaurant - big hot plates with orange rice, refried beans with cheese, and some standard entree - i.e. flautas, chimichangas or fajitas.  The margaritas are not special (taste like a mix or a pre-bottled version).  So why do I like it?  Because it's one of those little family run places with a great one-of-a-kind atmosphere.  Because the chips come warm and with two kinds of salsa.  Because the staff cares and makes you feel at home.   I go for the atmosphere and the perfectly adequate food.  Incidentally - the flautas were overcooked - crunchy, but the fajitas were quite good."}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale for Thanksgiving, the family opted to go out for Mexican Food one night. Not only was I excited to sample some of Arizona's notorious Mexican cuisine, but who am I to turn down a free meal?  Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?  While not overly packed on the Wednesday evening that my party of six visited, service seemed a bit on the rushed side. While our particular server (who appeared to possibly the the owner) was very nice, the she seemed to be ushering us along quite quickly. While not enough to warrant a star deduction, this should probably be noted. Star Granted.  Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?  As far as the selection goes, La Fonda is pretty much on par with any of the basic Mexican joints that I've encountered in Colorado or Los Angeles. However, while the menu had a decent selection, mostly combinations of Tacos, Enchiladas, Burritos and Platters, prices were very much on the high side. I opted to go for the Machaca Dinner, and for $13.50 pre-tax, this is what I received:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Vj-NbtXv5UrYBDUvqUuYqA&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg  Hm. Yes, that's a decent amount of meat, but I'd certainly say no more than $6 or $7 worth. That being the case, roughly $6 was spent on basic Spanish rice and beans? Yikes. Even for gourmet Mexican, that's too much. No Star Granted.  Stars 3/4 - How was the food?  While I wasn't disappointed with my meal, it was by no means the best Mexican I've ever had. The Machaca was very dry (overly crunchy at some points, and the rice and beans were nothing special. Especially paying $13.50? Quality needs to be bumped up a bit. Single Star Granted.  Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?  With the truly vast number of Mexican options in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, I can't say there's any way I could make La Fonda Del Sol a daily stop due to high prices and mediocre food and service. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet. Food is really good. Service is just as good. The chimichanga is gigantic. One of the best places in that area."}
{"text":"This is the place my friends and I go for Mexican food. Very tasty, affordable, and fairly quick service."}
{"text":"First time there and they have a cute little enclosed front porch which is great at all times of the year (except summer of course). It's kinda a divey little spot but divey for your grandma. Prices are right in line with every other mexican spot. The normal fare, chimis, burritoes, fajitas, tacos. I had the cheese enchiladas and they were amazing! La Fonda offers something a little different in a mexican food place in that they have an all you can eat buffet, lots of different types of meat and beans. Pretty cool, no valid complaints other than the service was kinda slow but they were still friendly. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix area.  Not fancy, just great traditional Mexican fare from friendly servers and management at very fair prices. You can tell the cooks have been there forever as the food is very consistent, always timely and served hot.  Nothing like the big chains steam table food. Just go"}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem. You would never know from the exterior what lies beneath. Definitely worth a stop, but don't take a seat at the bar. That poor thing is sad looking."}
{"text":"Met up with Rand H and Norm R for lunch here today.  We had been talking about going for Mexican food and Rand had been here before and liked it.  We got here right at 11am when they opened and all decided to do the buffet.  There weren't a lot of food choices - I had a cheese enchilada that was pretty good, a chile relleno that was just okay, some beef fajita meat that was fatty and tough, average rice and beans.  Nothing spectacular but not bad.  I think if I came here again I'd order off the regular menu and skip the buffet."}
{"text":"I love la fonda!  This is one of my fav mexican spots in town.  It's reasonably priced and the service is always pretty quick.  I highly recommend the taco salad with chicken, but I have ordered a little bit of everything on the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was very average, nothing to write home about. The first thing we noticed was how loud it was. The way the restaurant is set up makes it very loud if there are a lot of people there.  We went on a Friday night so it was busy. It was hard to have conversation with the person sitting across from me."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check out this local Mexican spot and we were overall pleased. The good: 1) the food was good and came out fast 2) the service was attentive 3) the margaritas were good and on happy hour... the bad: 1) the margaritas were small. That just means I had to order more :) we will definitely be back to this old and rustic Mexican eatery."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great prices, great atmosphere! It came up as the #1 Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Had the buffet...absolutely terrible.  Not sure where the get the beef from but really tough"}
{"text":"After eating here several times - finally, a review.  This place is good!  What do I like about La Fonda Del Sol, you ask?  Well, first, it definitely has an ol' family restaurant, cantina-dive vibe.  Second - chips are brought to the table with two carafes of salsa and the chips are always HOT.  I mean HOT.  And Fresh - if not needing just a little salt.  Salsas are both delicious, and fresh.  (One of my favorite new \"F\" words.). Queso is delicious, and tip/note - comes with freshly made flour tortilla chips, not corn as is served HOT and complimentary with salsa.  Obviously a crowd pleaser because every table around me ordered the queso.  Third - Food comes out quickly, and also HOT.  Can't touch the plate hot.  And how do they make it stay hot for so long?  I have ordered a number of dishes but still come back to the chicken chimi with cream cheese.  I love cream cheese, and it is a different and tasty addition.  Seriously, I think there are three shredded/chunked chicken breasts wrapped in a deep fried pillow of delicious, then smothered with green sauce and melted cheese.  I have noticed they don't call it green chili on the menu, and it really isn't traditional green chili.  It is delicious though, and obviously made fresh from fire roasted green chilis.  Not too pepper hot - just the right \"kick.\"  Tasty retried beans; and rice.  Some may complain about the price, but for me each dish is at least two meals - so worth it from my perspective.    What to watch out for?  It gets crowded, and L-O-U-D.  Service is typically good, but I am not sure how they \"assign\" tables.  We typically have to wait to be first greeted, but then it stays pretty consistently attentive.  I have never been in the bathrooms, so can't speak to them, but the place is clean-ish.  Not dirty; just not confidently clean.  There were a couple of used napkins on the floor under my table, and I had to brush crumbs off my chair.  Not a big deal though.  The entry is not inviting.  In fact, it's a bit scuzzy.    Lastly, my only and completely random complaint, that they can really do nothing about (and it isn't deterring me from going back) - when you leave, you and your clothes are going to smell like you've been immersed in onion-grease-Mexican-corn-salsa-dip.  Not sure why or what it is because it isn't a prevalent smell or Odor inside - but trust me, you're going to smell it until the clothes and hair are washed.  All in all a good spot for tasty Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Loved this small, intimate place. Great service.  Margaritas were prepared by the bartender and not pre-made. We ordered the green corn tamale, shrimp enchilada, beef tacos and chicken enchilada all with green chili. Generous portions. Hot sauce is hot and spicy as it should be. They offer a mild salsa as well. Only criticism is the hard taco shells seemed a little tough and were served in the enchilada sauce on the same plate so we're soft on the bottom. Definitely a place to keep on our list of favorites!"}
{"text":"Refried beans are awesome - best in the Valley!  Their hot sauce is terrific, but my husband wasn't a huge fan of the regular salsa.  The front entrance could definitely use some brightening up a bit, but don't let that deter you!  Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I got take out and it was overwhelming awesome! I got free chips and three salsas, guacamole, sour cream, and pick de gallo included with no charge and the shrimp and steak fajitas were just delicious! I'm definitely getting this again."}
{"text":"Wonderful service - Brittany even asked our names and used them the entire dinner.  Wow!  We loved the warm chips and great salsa, my chimichanga was yum!  Will be heading there again!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time this week while in Phoenix on business. From chips and salsa, to food and drink and service? EXCELLENTE!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place...really, I did!  After reading reviews and looking at pictures, I had to try it.  The chips and salsa--very good!  The carne asada--not good.  At all.  It was very salty and kind of gross.  Instead of serving it like a steak (like I'm used to), it was cut up for me...I felt like I was 5 years old and not allowed to touch a knife.  I feel bad because our server was so nice!  I wish I could give 5 stars for the server alone, but unfortunately I went there for carne asada, not the waitress!"}
{"text":"Fajitas with burnt vegetables and a chx quesadilla with 8# of cheese, zero vegetables. I'll pass."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times before and just realized ive never left a review for them.  This place is truly a diamond in the rough for Scottsdale hidden on Scottdale and Shea.   The salsa Is flavorful and fresh, sooo good. My favorite is the chicken fundido, highly recommend. I posted a pic too.  Staff is attentive and at 6:30 there are few booths available,  don't let that discourage you.... Just tells you its great.  I know another post commented on the ventilation,  no idea wth they are talking about. Place does not smell, it's old but it's clean. Try it... It's worth my 20 min drive!"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  We like the cheese enchiladas.  Service pleasant.  Atmosphere rather \"hole in the wall\".   Prices are too high for this type of place."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some Mexican food and stumbled across this joint.  It's a casual dining place with 15 or so tables and a small bar.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are included with your meal.  They give you 2 types of Salsa.....Mild and Spicy.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=7TDycarU8SKS1PQzilc2_w The Spicy Salsa is very good.....the Chips are very thin and break easily....so they got 1/2 of that right. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=9NUxLme4YMrPXxSrw5vkHw  For dinner we ordered:  Cheese Crisp Appetizer - $7.25 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=W6kOQlY8S8ke97Of4UQkFg #11 Cheese Enchilada Combo (Enchilada, Beans, Rice) - $11.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=UJEi2YPoYm73iJrXOdz1lA Carnitas Burrito - $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=1_A4f--rniKJFcd3UfGG5A Side of Sour Cream - $1.35 2 Glasses of House Cabernet - $6.75  The Cheese Crisp was very good.

The Better Half enjoyed her Carnitas Burrito, but she said it wasn't anything special.  She only ate 1/2 of it....took the other 1/2 home.

{"text":"Great food, great salsa and surprisingly good coffee at a very reasonable price (make that a low price if you are going for lunch between 11am-4pm).  La Fonda Del Sol is by no means elegant, but that doesn't seem to be the point of this place, i.e. it doesn't need to be.  It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for good non-corporate chain Mexican food.  P.S. Although I've not yet had a chance to try the margaritas (and I hate to post hearsay) they come highly recommended from what I would call a \"trusted source.\" I'll update when I have personal knowledge."}
{"text":"So good. Cheap, delicious, authentic, no frills. Very kind staff. Nice outdoor covered patio in the back. Best nachos of my life."}
{"text":"The service was excellent but the food was terrible! And overpriced!! Possibly the worst mexican food I have ever eaten. We ordered a beef taco, a beef flauta, a chimichanga meal and guacamole. The guac was decent but very tiny portion. All the meats tasted like they were just boiled in water, completely flavourless. Cannot recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was good and they were able to seat a larger group pretty easily. Chips and salsa are great, just try not to fill up on them. The food was good and the chimichanga I had was great. Carnitas are large chunks of well seasoned and cooked pork! I loved it. No one was raving about their dishes but all seemed to like them. I would go hear again if I were in that area."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food anywhere, not just in AZ! They have the best chips and salsa and their shredded beef enchiladas and shrimp enchiladas are unbeatable as well!  I'm sure other menu items are equally amazing, but those are so delicious that I can't bring myself to try other things. The service has always been extremely warm and friendly.  Truly a gem!!"}
{"text":"We had two chicken chimichangas.  They were huge and absolutely delicious!  The salsa and chips were fresh and delicious!  Great place!"}
{"text":"I got street tacos ordered from ubereats and they were good-fresh tortilla, good salsa, and meat was ok, but very small for the price. I was a bit disappointed with the size."}
{"text":"A great authentic and affordable, reasonably priced Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since I was my kids age and its still a family favorite.  The food is very good and has been consistent over the years.  We have never ordered anything that we didn't enjoy.   The only thing I noted yesterday was the cheese crisp was 'runny' and not spread or cut evenly...I think it came out too early.  Also they used to bring the hot salsa out in a full container and now only do half; that said, they gladly bring more.  (Chips and salsa are excellent.)  Most of the servers have been there 'forever' and the owners is always around and active.   When we arrived yesterday they weren't busy, so service started out good.   However, in the next half an hour they filled to capacity and they weren't staffed for it, so it was very difficult to get prompt or attentive service from that point forward.  The atmosphere is where they suffer a bit.  The restaurant hasn't been updated in years and their is quite a bit of wear and tear.   But the oddest part, that I noticed today, and then when I read other reviews, is that something about the ventilation system means your clothes end up smelling really strongly of the kitchen.   I don't know what they can do about that without closing down for a significant remodel and none of us locals want that."}
{"text":"I came to this place based on the reviews and the pictures that looked pretty good, however, that was not the case. This place is by far the worst Mexican food restaurant that I have ever tried, def. not authentic Mexican food. We ordered chicken and the chicken was so burnt that it was so hard. The fries were also burnt that they were just stiff. The carne asada burrito tasted like old meat and over used oil and the tortillas were terrible."}
{"text":"When I'm traveling to AZ I'm always on the hunt for good Mexican food. La Fonda Del Sol did not disappoint. We were there on a Monday nite, so it wasn't too busy. We were seated quickly. Almost as we sat down the chips ( warm and fresh) and salsa were served. 2 different salsa, one a little  more spicy than the other, mixed together, it was great.  I ordered the cheese enchilada and tamale combo. These are 2 of my Mexican favorites. My plate was hot, the food was hot and again we didn't wait long for the meals to arrive. My husband ordered the beef burrito and he said it was also very good. The Burrito was pretty big, and neither of us left hungry. We also ordered the Fried Ice Cream, once again it was very good..  We will definitely visit La Fonda Del Sol again."}
{"text":"Have to say how thoroughly impressed we all were with La Fonda!! And, when I say \"we\" I mean our party of 35 people ...teenagers and parents after a soccer league tournament with most guests here from other states. First off, they gladly took our reservation and our nice long table was set and easy to go when we arrived. Second, as the group filtered in they were quick to take our drink orders (BTW margaritas are perfectly mixed), and third, the owner, Roman, managed to effortlessly take everyone's order with having to keep track of managing about 10 different checks!!! The food (which was amazing!!!) came out fast, hot, and perfect!! With all the noise and chaos amidst our own group, there were 2 orders miscommunicated, but, they fixed everything quickly and were all too glad to make everything perfect. We had so many different items ordered, but everyone had nothing but smiles, compliments and empty plates at the end (even with the huge portions)...it was just that hard to stop eating. I personally had the spinach enchiladas and they were divine! Fresh chips, home made salsas and sauces, warm and gracious staff all added to an unforgettable group dinner! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Oreganos was full so we meandered over here. I ordered the large taco salad which came in a small bowl and was half water. It looked like bag salad covered in cafeteria junk. My kids pizzas were super mini Tostinos pizza pockets out of a box. Overall, the average age of customers was around 80 ... and mostly because they have probably all lost their taste buds."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The food is spot on and the service is always perfect!  I normally get the combo which has a beef enchilada, beef tamale and a beef taco!! I have three words to describe it: FAB-U-LOUS!!!!! The margaritas aren't bad either!!! Oh Yeah! The chips and salsa are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with 2 girlfriends for a celebratory occasion. We were seated in a booth and promptly served warm tortilla chips (homemade) with 2 little carafes of salsa (one was pico de gallo and the other was a spicier).  I ordered the 2 Tamale dinner and was a tad disappointed as there was so much melted cheese and grease, I couldn't even \"find\" the 2 alleged tamales?! I did sample my friend's dinner (2 beef tacos) and the beef was perfectly seasoned and not too dry - great job!!   The service was friendly and attentive - I may go back here but definitely would order something else. I came home smelling of Mexican restaurant, and the smell was still lingering in my car the following morning driving to work?"}
{"text":"Another great Mexican spot in Arizona.  Does it ever get bad here??  Love this place, read many great reviews and finally stopped by and had a wonderful, flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Night before we went to The Mission. Supposedly the groovy food for Mex. too weird for me After drinks at Maestros we needed food! La Fonda is the bomb!  Roach atmosphere but awesome chow! Green Chili Burrito and Chicken Enchiladas  Cadillac Margarita  and Negro Modelo Sleeping well tonight"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the time it took from ordering my dinner till it came to me was unacceptable.  Wasn't worth the 35 minute wait.  Yes the place was crowded, but how long does it take to build one taco and assemble a chicken enchilada in a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Got a chimmy from here for lunch it was really great I would recommend this place to anyone that's in the hood. Chips came out super hot which was great salsa they bring to your table was really good and the food was ready really fast what more do you want. If it was dinner I would have gotten a margarita but had to be back at work."}
{"text":"Consistently outstanding Sonoran Mexican Food. Always consistent and great service. Machaca is outstanding as is the grilled shrimp burrito"}
{"text":"Best Salsa in town , hands down. I could literally drink a vat of this stuff.  Not a gourmet meal, but I've never had a bad one here and I've been coming here 1x per month for the past 20 years.  Carnitas or carne asada  hard shell tacos are my suggestion."}
{"text":"Their chips and salsa are the best I've had! The chips come with a bottle of regular salsa and hot salsa, and they are generous to refill anything you need! The regular salsa is chock full of tomatoes, onions, cilantro...yum....mix in some of the hotter salsa on your plate and it's perfect!   I had their 2 chicken enchilada plate, no beans extra rice. It was really good, although it was cubes of chicken, rather than shredded chicken which I'm used to. Tasty, nonetheless, lol I'm just being overly picky :P Their rice was cooked well, and it came with a nice little side of lettuce and tomatoes.  All in all, a great plate of food! It was a tiny bit pricey...around $13.  But I really enjoyed my food! Service was great. My sister-in-law and I went on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm, and there were only a few other tables. They don't have horchata though :("}
{"text":"Large place and quite busy when we arrived, but ample staff provided fast and friendly service.  Great salsa (the fresh, chunky, non-spicy one of the two small carafes bright to the table).  Salsa and tortilla chips seemed infinitely refillable. Shrimp fajitas were delicious. \"Checking in\" on Yelp got me a free soft drink which was refilled for free as well.  Husband enjoyed large selection of beers to choose from.  Spanish rice was the best I've tasted (I usually have one bite and don't eat any more).  I appreciated the fact that salsa, rice, refried beans and guacamole were not at all spicy; other folks can always add hot sauce!  A great find on our unexpected one night in Scottsdale due to a cancelled flight."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food around! Their chicken quesadilla is TO DIE FOR. Service could be better, but the amazing food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I have not even eaten yet but the hospitality is 5 stars. Their salsas are great and everyone has a genuine smile for you !  Ok food is here and the tamales are yummy and comforting"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The staff treats everyone like family and I wouldn't go anywhere else in scottsdale for Mexican food. absolutely love it"}
{"text":"So I am very picky about my Mexican food & to be honest the ONLY reason we came to this place is because Oregano's was on their usual 50 hr wait. I was pretty scared when we walked up to it, and was just as scared when we were seated.  Before we got a chance to situate ourselves water & chips & salsa were in front of us.  The chips & salsa were good, not amazing but it was good & i had my fair share of them. I was VERY impressed with our servers speed & attention.  The entree prices are kinda pricey...meaning $11-$13 a plate but we ordered them anyway.  To my surprise the food was GREAT! I don't remember the name of the plate I ordered but it had an enchilada, a taco, & a tamale.  EVERYTHING was good! I mean, not blow your mind you'll never have anything better than this again, but it was very tasty.  If we ever have to long of a wait at Oregano's again, we will return.  However we live in Phoenix so the chances of us being in Scottsdale again just for Mexican food are slim.  But I would recommend it to anyone who wants good food & speedy service."}
{"text":"I went to La Fonda Del Sol with a group of 14.  We were put in a room that was acoustically challenging.  Voices just bounced off the walls so you could here anyone talk.  I ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada.  Boy have I tasted better.  The beef was greasy and tasted kind of foul.  The cheese enchilada was drowning in cheese that I couldn't find the enchilada.  Oh, the refried beans???  Canned.  Yuck.  Someone asked for another tortilla and they were charged $3.00.  They were not told by the waitress that there would be an extra charge.  And when the person asked about the charge the assistant manager came over and actually started arguing with the person.  Such poor customer service for a darn tortilla.  Expensive for the low quality of food.  I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"There is no better tasting Mexican food , this gem of a place will always have me bringing my friends"}
{"text":"The server Chris was so nice and helpful. He recommended the fajitas. They were absolutely fantastic. Excellent prices too."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker. Started with chips and 2 kinds of salsa. One was a traditional mild salsa, the other was blazing hot, which made me very happy. The beef enchilada was awesome. I ordered 1 a la carte, and it was plenty of food. My co-worker had beef flautas and loved them. We arrived just as they opened, and when we left, the place was packed. Obviously the locals know it's great authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Super food.  Always crowded, but the staff get you seated and fed.  Order the pitcher of beer to save a bundle."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night and was able to get a table with no wait. Service was good and fast. Salsa and chips were fresh and tasty. Went with the servers recommendation and got the Toppopo Salad. Chicken was seasoned well and the salad dressing was light and very good."}
{"text":"Met some friends last night for dinner.  Greeted promptly, great little outside seating area.  Cold beers, crisp chips, fresh and delicious salsa.   Ordered a simple Carne Asada burro with some pico inside.  My wife ordered the Miniature Combo. Both were excellent.  Great place for North Scottsdale.  Oh yeah, very reasonable prices!!!  Cheers"}
{"text":"Second visit here and food was just as good. Service was a little slow for Saturday at 3 but was with a larger group so it wasn't as big if a deal."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot as a late night eatery. They really aren't that many places in Phoenix they're open 24 /7 that you can get a decent meal.  The many tacos are delicious and the seafood quesadilla could feed an entire family. I'm never had a bad meal here and considering the options around the area it's always a reasonably priced and delicious choice."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11 am just as they were putting out the fresh hot buffet. The buffet is absolutely amazing and delish and as always the service is prompt and friendly"}
{"text":"We ended up here because it was almost 9PM on a week night.  First time and we had a bogo coupon from the entertainment guide as well.  We both loved everything.  Being the last customers for the night I totally expected the staff to be butthurt but they weren't.  Everyone we encountered smiled and was friendly.  Several other tables emptied and it was close to closing time, the mop never came out, they didn't start flipping the chairs upside down on the tables. I had the La Fonda Chimi which was wonderful.  He had the chicken fajitas and they came with the usual on a separate plate. I loved the guacamole and the salsa. The chips were hot and fresh. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had.  We had take out with tacos which were to die for and steak fajitas with lime.  The Salsa is excellent with medium mixed with hot.  We went there on recommendation by Luis Gonzalez. Rename the Fajitas to \"Gonzo Fajitas\"."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. I tend to judge authenticity and goodness of Mexican food by a) how much beans, rice, and cheese do they pile on, and b) if I ate nothing but beans and rice, would it be delicious? The answers here are a) plenty and b) yes! I bought a sampler with an enchilada and a taco. The taco was one of those homestyle kind, where they start with a soft tortilla and fry it into shape until it's crispy. The setting is only so-so, it's a narrow dining room with not a lot of variety of seating options. The price was quite reasonable, but not cheap, somewhere around less than $15 after drink and tip for the least expensive but filling sampler lunch on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little Mexican restaurant. I had a carne asada taco and a chicken enchilada. The carne asada was amazing! The enchilada was decent. I will definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 or 6 times over the last two years and the food is always great.  Service has always been good as well and I have never felt rushed to leave after the meal.  Decent prices as well.  We would definitely eat here more often if we lived closer."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend that told me they had great salsa. She was right, however I don't get the salsa in a jar thing. My margarita was good too. My taco and enchilada combo was OK, but nothing great. I had asked for a side of sour cream, which I later found out on my bill cost me $2.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream! The server should have told me that, and I would have declined because that's insane - I deducted it from her tip, not to mention she seemed to want nothing to do with us.  The place is old and run down. The ceiling fan light that was over us was flickering and clearly needed to be changed. I think I almost had a seizure from all the flickering.   I haven't been back since, not saying that I wouldn't try it again, but was not impressed enough to want to come back."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem! My boyfriend and I have seen this place on Yelp for awhile and we are so glad we finally tried it. The food was super fresh and delicious! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Always good.  Staff pleasant and attentive and the food portions are generous.  We are regulars.  Highly recommend the spinach enchiladas or taco salad.  Both are excellent"}
{"text":"Very good food. Not a fancy place but a great place to get good tasting food. The was oven hot. Very fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of the oldest still-running restaurants in the area. It shares a name with one of the newest restaurants on Park Avenue in New York, but is completely unrelated. In fact, I'm sure the experience you'll have here is just about the opposite.  It's in a location that the 70s Historical Preservation Society must be fighting to keep alive. I'd like to say it has character, but this old poorly designed strip should probably be nuked from space. However, you can't really complain too much when it's one of the few remaining old-school Mexican joints in town.   It's clean, everyone is nice, and the atmosphere inside is cozy. As my mother said... if you eat here, you can pretty much plan on going home smelling like Mexican food. Whether that's a good or bad thing can be up to you.   The food is just slightly above average for this type of place. Chips were okay. I put the salsa as below average. It was flavorless, but hot. The cheese crisp was good... not too oily. The guac was good. My entree was decent. It's the type of place that serves you standard old-school dishes - generally an ugly 70s plate full of grease with a sea of beans and slop and cheese and whatnot on the side. Same story as many other places. Too much to eat, and basically none of it is healthy, and basically all of it will either constipate you or clean you out.  The margaritas were pretty good. I would eat and drink here again I suppose if someone else was paying. This is your mom and dad's joint. Wish it was better."}
{"text":"Food is bomb.  Love the small town feel.  Great service.  Love the fajitas and chips and salsa.  Drinks are good too."}
{"text":"Great salsa.  Solid service.  Love the location and space.  The shredded beef tamale and taco were delicious."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, I always test the salsa and chips to see if it will be good. I was not disappointed. And then I found out they have a all you can eat Mexican food buffet that I heard was great, I am going to try that this week. I always have the cheese enchiladas which comes with rice and refried beans they were the best refried beans I ever had. A must place to go for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Servers were friendly.  The Del Sol Combination dinner I ordered was truly delicious. The tortilla chips were probably the best I have ever had!   The place is cozy and casual with wall paintings and mirrors. It looks like Mexico and it is very much an authentic Mexican restaurant independently owned.  Even though the price seems to be a little (by a couple of dollars) on the higher side, I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"La Fonda is located next to Oregano's on Shea.  It's a small little Mexican restaurant, but the food is really good.  The salsa is delish and the margaritas can always bring a smile to my face.  They're really strong, like a good margarita should be, and purchasing a pitcher of them mid-day when I should be working, makes them taste even better.  The waiters are friendly and fast, and I've never had a bad experience there.  It's a casual place, so you can come dressed however you want, and it's the perfect spot for a quick meal.  I've never had to wait for a table either- which is good for me, but probably not so great for the restaurant.   A couple of times, I've come here instead of going to Oregano's when they have their two hour wait going on, and I'm always glad I did.  Give it a try next time you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum! Great chips and salsa, phenomenal service. Soda is always nasty, no matter what I order. The food is great! Their green corn tamale takes the cake as best tamale, and with chicken over it it is delightful. Tostadas, taco salads, taquitoes, just about everything here has been delicious. Great enchiladas, etc. They have amazing refried beans, really some of the best. Very friendly atmosphere. We go here all the time. While their cheese crisps are by no means crispy, the cheese they use is amazing, and I often crave it. I have it with their salsa and its awesome. Even though Im normally fond of crispy cheese crisps, this is addictive! Love La Fonda Del Sol cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place has been in Scottsdale forever and I can tell why. I've been here a few times, each time the staff has been very friendly and accommodating, their salsa is bomb and I recommend the steak fajitas!"}
{"text":"Was in a bit of a rush so we tried their buffet. It really was 1 step below a happy hour taco bar. There were no tortillas, 15 min wait after alerting them they brought out 5. The selection of items makes it tough to find even 2 things you would want (I'm not being picky, I know it's a buffet). I really hate to sound this harsh, but it really was not good and had no value for money. If this is the level they can provide for the price they should just discontinue it. I probably won't return even though menu items might be better, the experience left me so dissapointed I can't find a reason to try again."}
{"text":"Salsa=5 star. Very good cheap mexican food.  If you're into beef taco's like I am you will love this place."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Scottsdale. Fresh chips and homemade salsa. Fajitas were wonderful period been coming here for years and always have consistency in the food service and atmosphere. Great price for quality food."}
{"text":"Hole in the Wall that has been in Scottsdale a long time. Not very large so go in on slow time. Great food, great salsa and just as good margaritas. Visiting in Scottsdale, must try- Inexpensive!"}
{"text":"This is really good Mexican food on a budget. The decor is standard, the service is wonderful, and the food is amazing. I have been to this location several times and have been pleased with everything I have ever ordered. The tostadas and the chimichingas really stand out in my memory.  Their chips and salsa are some of the best I have tasted."}
{"text":"My Son absolutely loves this place and he describes as his favorite Resteraunt. Enjoyed  for at least ten years and one year he insisted on having his birthday dinner at La Fonda. The staff use to tease him about getting a job when he turned sixteen. We moved away last year and it has been that long since we visited. Went for the buffet and as usual my Son gave it five stars. I love the soft tacos and he loves the buffet. The buffet is huge and for Approx $9.00 you get all you can eat. For a growing boy this is the bomb!  I love the Margaritas as well. Always clean and very polite. It's your neighborhood Resteraunt and the same people have worked in the establishment for years!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and they are consistent with a couple of things.  First off the chips and salsa rock!  The hot salsa is very tasty and the chips are usually hot and fresh.  The taco plate is always a winner.  And the service usual is usually iffy.  It's good 50% of the time.   For the food that you get the price is very reasonable.  I will def go back, even if it's just for the chips and salsa, since after all that's what good Mexican food is all about!! (stay away from the older woman/manager...she is RUDE!!  and don't even TRY to use a restaurant.com gift certificate..she will cut you!  lol)"}
{"text":"The food was not good. We ordered tacos to go. Though we ordered the same item some came with soft and some hard tortilla...weird. No good flavors or textures. Skip this place!"}
{"text":"The best Salsa, great margarita's, very friendly staff, I've only been in 3x over a 2 month period and the waitress remember my name each time I come in."}
{"text":"When they bring the chips and salsa, ask for a straw.  Stick it in the mild salsa container and suck until the container is empty.  This will be the culinary height of the meal.  I ordered the Armando Combination so that I could try different things.  Don't do that.  I heard a waitress suggest the Carne Burrito.  Too late for my order.  The food, simply said, was bland.  The mild salsa was a medley of fresh ingredients in just the right mix.  Awesome.   The interior was classic small Mexican restaurant.  The service was fine.  Honestly, another visit is necessary to make a final decision.  But until then, I have to agree with Kansas G.  So, if you came for the food review, you can move on.  If you are interested in a little social commentary, please read on.  [Steps up on soapbox]  1) I really wish someone had warned me that this was \"loud talker night\" at La Fonda.  I'd have gone tomorrow.  2) Memo to the F-bomb boys across the restaurant: This isn't a saloon or some spit on the floor, get piss drunk night out at the pool hall.  So could you please keep the F-bomb laced conversation for the ride home?  I realize you were here on \"loud talker night\" but that only intensified the offensiveness.  Don't get me wrong, I love a great profanity-laced conversation as much as the next guy, just not at dinner.  3) While I'm sure that you believe that the $3.95/month you're paying for that shitty and annoying ringtone is a great investment, Harley-wearin'-F-bomb dude, I don't want to hear it at dinner.  Put the F-er on F-ing vibrate, please.  Does that help?  4) And then, once you answer the shitty ringtone call, please realize that the dude on the other end of the line does not hear you any better if you YELLLLL.  Of course I do, complete with the F-bombs.  [Stands down from soapbox]  What the hell is happening to our manners?  Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere. The staff is so nice.  Love their pollo fundido.  Gotta love a good locally owned, small pace! Love it, I bring company to this restaurant whenever they're in town!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! All of it is home made and fresh. The enchiladas could be made corn or flour and the corn chicken enchiladas were very good. The amount of cheese and flavoring was perfect. The chips were freshly made and came out not warm but HOT. The La Fonda burrito was good and filling to the last bite. The  flan was delicious specially the whip cream. Of course the house margarita hit the spot for a Friday night. Great place, everyone there is very friendly... We will return."}
{"text":"We love this place and have been going there for twenty years. The food is authentic and reasonably priced. It has a family atmosphere. The chimichangas are incredible. La Fonda is a fantastic neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Great food and easy to get in and out of quickly."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  My boyfriend and I frequently visit Phoenix and usually try a new restaurant every time. After eating here on our last trip to PHX we decided we had to come ever single time now. I got the\"mini sampler plate\". It was a perfect amount of everything (tamale, tostada, taco and cheese enchilada). All of it was excellent. My boyfriend got the nachos,we could not believe the amount of food that it was!  Our server was very attentive, and the atmosphere is excellent.  Overall a very nice Mexican Restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is still great here but we've stopped going. I don't know if it is the ventilation but the way you smell afterwards is just too incredibly strong and yucky."}
{"text":"Gave this a lot of thought before posting . I've been here 3 times.   I like the food. Price to portion is good value. 4 stars. Nothing is a stand out. Good American-ized Mexican food. Good chips, salsa and hot sauce. They have Fanta!  Service is spotty. 3 to 5 stars.  Dining room is every bit the dive. But it's clean. 5 stars. See \"restrooms\" below.   Consistent with being a dive, the menu has mis-prints. \"Cream cheese.\" On Mexican food? Probably mean sour cream, I think. Either that or the cream cheese is super sour and soupy!  Restrooms are out of the 1970s. 0 stars. Just avoid them. Probably costs too much to remodel which would force ADA compliance and cut into their dining area.  I imagine this place does just fine without worrying about fixing anything.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Like many people, we ended up at La Fonda thanks to an hour+ wait at Oreganos. It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or a night to impress anyone by ambiance, but I have to admit that the food was fantastic. And if there's one thing my family knows about - it's Mexican Food.   I had a simple Bean & Cheese Burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. It was moist and filled with tons of beans and cheese and the enchilada sauce was great. My mother-in-law go the salad with fresh grilled pineapple, mango and chicken and it was delicious as well. The chips and salsa were pretty good (I still prefer Aunt Chiladas) but the service was quick, the vibe was mellow and the food was tasty.   I don't live in the area and won't be driving out of my way to come back, but I'd recommend it if you're in the area and looking for some good Mexican.  Note: the combination entrees seemed a little pricey to me. We each got al-a-cart items which came with sour cream, lettuce & tomato and were plenty big."}
{"text":"Service was horrible for my takeout order. The only person to help was the hostess and she was the only to even say a word to me. But the food was great!"}
{"text":"I live a few minutes from La Fonda and tried it for the first time last night and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. From the outside it doesn't really look like anything special, but the food was great and the service was good. I really enjoyed my topoppo salad and their salsas are delicious! I wasn't thrilled with my margarita, but that was my only qualm. I'm happy to have found good Mexican in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great food, great taste, great staff...no horchata or Jamaica though! Nonetheless, the reason for the 4 stars is I've had better not-too-far, though for the immediate area they are probably the best in the 1-1.5 mile radius though, including \"the one across the street\" (so far, my opinion)."}
{"text":"Very popular local restaurant. The food and chips were surprisingly warm and hot. This is a delightful small cafe in a very busy part of town. If you are in a hurry it is nice to have the buffet  as an option."}
{"text":"Been a customer since 1991. Totally crave this place and not many others compare. Shredded beef taco and Chimi special are superior. Chips served warm and are light and crispy. Yum!!! Accented by the best salsas. Great food and large portions."}
{"text":"Great nachos and everything is made fresh to order. highly recommend the Cadillac margarita on the rocks"}
{"text":"Walked in at 11am and ordered beef burro to go.  It had shredded beef and came with side of salsa and side of some red chilli sauce and a bag of fresh tortilla chips. The salsa/Pico and red sauce were good.  The beef was good but it was watery because it was stewed in onions, tomatoes, celery and ??? It was tasty but it got the burro soggy after awhile...eat it fast and get plenty of napkins. or ask for more foil to hold it together."}
{"text":"Decent food, not authentic Mexican food but it is filling, salsas are a little better than the Salsa Picante Pace, waiter was helpful but since they were closing, was a bit pushy to get us out, place closes at 9pm which is strange where I come from, all Mexican restaurants close at 1 or 2 AM, kind of disappointed at Mexican food in this town"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  It is like a diner inside, seating and such... the food is wonderful.  I love the salsa containers...cute.  The food was great, plenty of it too!  I had a full meal and my husband had only a taco.  We shared the rice and beans I got, and we were both stuffed!  Margarita was great and his beer was icy cold and great too!"}
{"text":"This was not enjoyable. The service was good and our server was attentive. We were not impressed with the food. The salsa had so much onion and cilantro that we could not taste the tomatoes. It was overwhelming with onion favor. The queso was very similar to nacho cheese dip from a can, it was not the traditional white Mexican cheese, it was bright yellow. My tacos were cold."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a very long time. They do a decent job but in the last couple years I have thought they have lost some of the quality of the food as well as the service. Many other Mexican places to choose from in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I used to babysit for the previous owner's kids when I was a teen and they'd bring home La Fonda food for their children, but never give me any and I'd be so jealous. I was always curious about this restaurant's food so I finally tried it. It was just okay. In fact, I'd give 2 stars but the rest of my family liked it so I'm giving 3.  My chicken taco was dry and bland. The red enchilada sauce had no flavor at all. The salsa was super yummy and fresh, though.   I won't ever go back - primarily because their ceiling fans cause the lights to flicker, which can trigger migraines, and which I'm prone to. If you get migraines, steer clear!"}
{"text":"If you want grease, come here.  If you want to feel like there is a giant ball of lard sitting at the bottom of your stomach, come here.  If you want diarrhea for the next 24 hours due to stomach lubrication, come here.  I went to La Fonda's because of the name. La Fonda reminded me of  the chick in Neapolitan Dynamite.  We set down and you can tell this place is family owned. There we're young teenagers waiting on the table, and their english wasn't even that great. After I received my enchiladas/beans/rice plate, I looked down to see a HUGE pile of grease.  Beans are what you'd expect from a can you buy at the store. No real flavor, nothing special. The rice was on the plain side too. Pretty authentic, but lacked flavor. Good sauce on the enchilada, but boy that pool of grease made me quiver.  Hot hot chips, decent salsa.  What can I say? I won't be back again. I like my Mexican food more fresh, but that's just me."}
{"text":"HAIR in my food.   My waitress apologized and said that she would comp my meal.  However, that didn't happen.  The woman who I assume is the owner told the waitress that she could take off a whopping 10%. Unreal!!'"}
{"text":"Well I've promised to put a few reviews on here to get past my joining Yelp just to vent my frustrations with one (now defunct) business.  So, I can think of no better restaurant to start with than La Fonda.  I've been coming here since I was kid; it was my father's favorite Mexican joint, and it is now mine and my son's as well!  My son and I have dinner alone together once a week and have made La Fonda our restaurant of choice!  The chips can be a bit greasy (hence not 5 stars), but they're always hot and fresh, and the salsa's hands down the best in town.  None of that cooked, tastes like it came from a jar stuff; just fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc.-- it's so good, I could inhale it.  Being the creatures of habit we are, Jacob and I always get the same things every week. (Nowadays, we just order \"the usual.\")  For Jacob, it's a cheese crisp with guacamole, for me, it's a machaca burro and a side of beans.  I've had other things in the past...  the tamales are wonderful too, but I absolutely LOVE the machaca.  It's tender, crispy and fried up with lots of onions and peppers.  It's delicious!!  The beans are good too, but beans are beans; it's the machaca I keep coming back for.   As for the atmosphere, it can definitely get a bit loud in there when it's busy.  The sound just seems to reverberate off the tile and concrete.  And...  pray that no one near you orders fajitas, or you will (guaranteed!) smell like them for the rest of the evening.   But, again, I am addicted to the machaca and therefore find the rest to be mere trifles.  What more can I say-- I love La Fonda."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food and fresh hot tortilla chips! It's been years since I've been here but was glad the food is still top notch. I ordered the chicken fundido with beans and rice and my spouse had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Both were delicious and filling. Will be back again for sure!"}
