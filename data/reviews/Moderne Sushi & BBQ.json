{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a zero I would, I have tried this place on three separate occasions and each time gets worse. The service is terrible, the sushi is NOT fresh and has made me sick and when you order something that is supposed to be cooked it comes out not cooked at all. This place is over priced and frankly really terrible, don't waste your money or health by going here."}
{"text":"Very good food and amazing service. The staff were so sweet and friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm so over this place. Sushi takes forever and always has some problem with the order.  Used to be our favorite restaurant and now after 3 or 4 bad visits we won't waste time or money on it."}
