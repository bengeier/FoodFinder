{"text":"Fantastic food and very attentive service. They also have a great wine tasting room downstairs you can rent."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal. My wife and I were looking to try somewhere new and we were not disappointed.

The grilled Octopus starter was very good. For the main course we ordered the Short Ribs and Ribeye Steak. The Short Ribs were good, the Ribeye was very good. Cooked to order, tender and flavourful. Both the Crepe and Chocolate Bread Pudding are decadent and very good. 

We will go back! Next time I won't be driving so I can enjoy something off the wine list which was comprehensive but not over the top snobby like some restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Must try them - you will not be disappointed! I wish I ate here a second time while visiting Toronto but we would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Not recommended for large groups.

Our experience was tainted by the restaurants long wait and haphazard food service as a result of our large group. The food is actually quite good and I suspect a nice experience for two people."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for four on Saturday night. When we arrived at 7:30 the place was quite empty but by 8pm it was packed. Pleasant ambiance. Not so loud so as to prevent conversation. Friendly staff. The empanadas were very good as was the octopus which we shared as an appetizer. The rib eye steaks were excellent...tender, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Deserts we shared - crepes and creme caramel - were delicious. Definitely worth a return visit"}
{"text":"I went on a busy Saturday night. 
Food 100%
Service 98%
Waiters very friendly and fast.
The only problem is that they kept mixing the orders or bringing the wrong food, but the good news is that the food was so good, that it didn't matter too much to get the wrong food, jajajaja. everything was soooo good. The best meat I ever tasted, cooked in the right and perfect way.
They gave me for free some Empanadas they brought by mistake to my table. Don't forget to taste the Empanadas (they were so good that I ordered more, so thanks for the mistake).

I recommend VOS 100%, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Where to begin..
After stumbling across this restaurant online, I switched my New Years reservations without any second thought and thank goodness I did.  I never feel the need to write a review (unless the restaurant is just horrendous) but this place scores a solid 10/10 in every aspect 

Food: having spent time in Argentina, I can say the quality of food was excellent. The chefs do an incredible job at preparing the meats without using an abundance of spices and marinades. Rather it's the quality of imported beef they fly in from Argentina. You can taste the quality of the beef from the first bite. Having tried sweetbreads in Argentina, I longed for them in Toronto, although all received was over cooked and tough meat. At Vos, it was tender and absolutely out of this world.  Appetizers were great, we had the grilled octopus which was very tender and had a beautiful charcoal taste. The Waldorf and remolada salads were both a perfect way to start the meal and both are highly recommended. We ended the meal with the chocolate pudding and flan which ended the meal on a sweet note. Both equally delicious without it being overloaded with sugar. 

Service: coming from over 10 years in the service industry, I can confidently say that the service on New Years was outstanding. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, attentive, accommodating and just an overall joy. The bartender was a book of knowledge, light in spirit and also very attentive. The owner accommodated our needs for the evening and we cannot thank him enough.  With an incredible selection of wines, we ended up picking an incredible Malbec. Their wine selection is vast and long but the staff are well trained to help select the right one for your palette. In Argentina, When you eat a meal - it's a feeling as if you are eating among family. We felt that this evening. 

We can't wait to come back in 2018 and try the wine tasting cellar

{"text":"I just went to Vos for the second time and meant to write a review last time as well. This restaurant was outstanding.  We originally found it on Yelp a month ago when I took a friend to the Caledonian (a scotch bar across the street) a few weeks ago. We were looking for steak and who better than the Argentinians to grill up a succulent one? The spot wasn't busy and service was fantastic.  The first time we ordered two (delicious) glasses of wine, a cheese plate to share, steak with Mushrooms for my friend, beef short ribs with sweet potatoes for me, and flan to share for dessert. With tax and tip it came out to about $190 for us. The second time we ordered a bottle of the same wine, two steaks with sweet potatoes (because, yum) and mashed potatoes. This time we skipped dessert and the cheese plate because it was too much food, but opted for the whole bottle of wine. It ended up coming up to be about the same price as last time.

If you're thinking about going to The Keg, skip it and come here instead. They import their meat from Argentina and it's all free range grass fed. It's also nice to support an independent company, especially when the quality is this good. 

My tip, when ordering steak, don't cook it more than medium-rare. I usually have mine about medium but medium-rare was perfect.

Another tip, definitely check out the Caledonian  before or after for a nice glass of scotch. We found the two establishments pair well together. 

This is our new favourite night out. The service is great, the ambiance is great, the food is fantastic, and costs no more than any other steakhouse in the city."}
{"text":"Best Argentinian restaurant in the city by far .
Everything was cook to perfection.
The service was impeccable, the atmosphere is very cozy and well designed.
I will totally recommend the Octopus as appetizer, their rib eye was so tender and juicy, is a-most have and you can go wrong with any of their desserts."}
{"text":"If you have any interest in Argentinian culture and food this is the place for you. It isn't that busy but it should be. The food is amazing. We had Empanadas: amazing light and fluffy pastry, Steak absolutely great imported from Argentina which makes it healthy and super high quality. 

We had amazing service and they also have an impressive Argentinian but also Spanish and Italian wine list. 

Go visit this restaurant immediately."}
