{"text":"Oh where do I start. My fianc√© and I were so excited to eat here from all the awesome reviews this place got. So not the case. We walked in and a pleasant woman greeted us and seated us. As we were seated we were able to see there is a couch in the back visible to the public. Well some guy was laying on it and I'm pretty sure she was too until we walked in.  We ordered and as we waited for the woman to cook everything, this guy finally gets off the couch and all you see is straight ass. His pants were falling off and there was just no hiding it. That's not what I want to see when I'm sitting down in a restaurant. We were the only people inside and it was just creepy. The woman waited on us and did everything. Thank goodness he stayed away. The food was subpar, nothing I would rave about.  This place earned itself a lifetime ban. That guy pretty much ruined it and we will never be going back. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! 

This is the best home made authentic Thai food that can be found in Cleveland. 

Stop what you are doing and run to Thai 130. I had the green curry and the fresh basil rolls. The hoison sauce is home made! 

Hey the green curry and the fresh rolls. Guaranteed delicious! Thank you Thai 130!"}
{"text":"Bumping it, because really, the Pad Thai is probably as good as you will find in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a whim. Delicious Thai and great vegetarian tofu dishes. Spring rolls were delicious. Very laid back, mom and pop operation as others mention. I had my reservations but the food was a+."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place that will constantly have you coming back for more! The Pad Thai is the best I've ever had. You can tell they make everything from scratch and it's fresh ingredients.  Friendly owners that are on top of it!"}
{"text":"very tasty! Pad Thai was very good, not too sweet. I had a dish with seafood, noodles, snap peas, peppers...I had it 'spicy' as opposed to Thai spicey and it was firey and delicious. humble decor, but very clean. friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my son because I had a craving for Yum Woon Sen. 

Right off the bat I loved the place, quiet, the music playing in the background, everything was very soothing. 

An older gentleman took our orders. He patiently explained items we were unfamiliar with and we opted for one of the curry dishes on a suggestion from him. 

We started off with a delicious soup and fried egg roll. The soup was spicy with a tang and bits of chicken. My son fell in love. We could have had that as a meal. 

Our order - basil egg rolls, seafood salad, silver noodle salad (the salads are meals by themselves), a fried rice and a curry. 

The seafood salad was very good, shrimp, small scallops and squid, they do not cut corners on this dish. When they mean hot it's HOT! Spicy goodness. Unfortunately this was my son's dish and I had to pick bits of heaven from across the table. 

The silver noodle salad was ordered with a hot level of spice and it was just as good. 

The curry was a mild heat that built as I ate. 

Alas, our eyes were bigger than out stomachs and we has to pack up our meals to go. The starter soup was so good we ordered a large to go. 

Do not pass on this place! It wasn't busy when we arrived, I'm sure as people find out about this Thai heaven it will be at the top of the list in the Cleveland area. 

Definitely will be returning."}
