{"text":"Casa Real recently opened in Monticello. The space previously held a different Mexican restaurant.

The space is huge. Perfect for family dinners and large groups. One con though is the booths are not comfortable. You can feel any time someone in the booth behind you moves. This is easily remedied by asking for a table instead. :)

Decent margarita specials throughout the week -- I had a frozen strawberry margarita that was delicious.

The chips and salsa are nothing special but the tacos are FABULOUS. I ordered the Three Amigos Tacos -- one grilled chicken, one grilled steak, and one shredded pork served with pico de gallo and rice and beans. The meat was all so tender and flavorful.  The pork had great smoke/char marks, too. The pico a refreshing topping and you have the choice of corn or flour tortillas (I chose flour).

I can see myself getting carry-out tacos here many times in the future. I hope that Casa Real can get consistent business despite being a bit off the beaten path."}

{"text":"Decent food, courteous staff, reasonable prices. I went for lunch and had #10. It was supposed to be hot and spicy. It didn't really give a lot of flavor. The taste was ok but not spicy. The waitress was pleasant. The decor was cliche Mexican but not over the top. Overall, an ok place to eat."}
