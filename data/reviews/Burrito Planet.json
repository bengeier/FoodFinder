{"text":"From California Burrito, to Burrito Planet, and now I have a new more accurate name to suggest to them: Bland Burrito. Ordered the steak and chicken burrito, and while the portion size was respectable, it was a runny mess of watery sauces streaming out of a near-flavourless stuffed pita. No compelling reason to return."}
{"text":"They key to this restaurant is to know what to order.  Despite the name, they are good at non-burrito things.  Their burrito bowl is excellent with good amounts of food at fast speed.  Similarly, their fries are excellent.  Planet fries are not just fries; planet fries are topped with tasty burrito ingredients.    WARNING: If you order burritos, be prepared to be shocked by poor practices.  Burritos are typically seared to seal in the juices.  This restaurant pokes holes in the burritos (to identify them) thus defeating the whole purpose of searing.  Also, they sear 4 sides individually taking an obscene amount of time.  If one follows this caveat (ie. do not order the burrito), then one can have a very enjoyable experience.  For this reason, I'm giving a high rating that is very different review from most of the reviewers here."}
{"text":"The worst burrito I've ever had. Not much meat, not much flavour, watery guac from a squeeze bottle.... Do yourself a favor and go to big fat burrito or burrito banditos! Actually I hope the owners go have one too, and fix their burritos..."}
{"text":"I had to buy lunch and didn't want subway for the third time in a week so I decided to give this place a try. I got a regular sized chicken and beef mixed, everything looked pretty standard except the rice with was just white rice (compared to other places which have a seasoned kind of rice they use).  It tasted OK, wasn't amazing. and near the end I realized the burrito was actually very soggy and a lot of liquid was leaking out. I guess it must have been the salsa but I've never had this issue before at other places.  I didn't hate this place but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was even better than I expected! I went to grab lunch here in between classes, and wasn't expecting the long line they had inside. I'm surprised that it has such low ratings on yelp actually.  The staff are beasts! Like well fuelled machines, they were extremely efficient and organized!  I got the regular vege burrito with everything and an iced tea! Absolutely delicious! It totally cost me around 9 dollars i think, and the regular burrito itself was 6.45$ if i remember correctly.  The burrito was filled with beans, rice, lettuce, corn, tomatoes, onions, cheese, cooked mushrooms, grilled eggplant, sour cream, guacamole, spicy salsa type thing, and some sauces that I can't remember as well!  Filling, delicious, and kind of messy at the end (its a burrito after all)  Im totally going back there! If you're vegetarian and have a craving for tex-mex, then look no further!  Bonus is that its on the UofT campus, so its a great place for a quick lunch in between classes"}
{"text":"Tamales, tacos, and quesedillas... I drool just thinking of all the great snacks and street foods you can get for cheap in California. But man, I love burritos. Rice, beans, meat, cheese, salsa, veggies, maybe a special house sauce if the place is upscale... a great burrito is simple, portable, self-contained, and just hits the spot.   Okay, this place is new, so they are clearly experiencing some growing pains. Eight of us went out for Friday lunch and waited 30+ minutes for burritos. The kitchen was quite disorganized so I hope they streamline the operation with time. For a bit under $12 with tax, I got 5 shrimp, some veggies, 2 tablespoons of rice, 2 tablespoons of black beans, and a tablespoon of shredded yellow cheese. I've never seen a burrito with practically no rice or beans before! Unfortunately, they also used pre-cooked cocktail shrimp and I didn't notice that they had left the shells on until 2 bites in and we were walking back to work.   There are better bets in Toronto to satisfy a burrito craving. Save your money."}
{"text":"Have been heading to Burrito planet after eating at Top Sushi and Subway for nearly two years. The price are acceptable, you get a very descent size burrito for only 7 bucks. For the same price, you may also ask for a burrito bowl that gives you (in my opinion) a lot bigger portion than the wrap itself. Very quick and healthy choice for students always in a rush and want to try something different!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian burrito is very, very bland. They essentially make it like a meat burrito and just omit the meat - no vegetarian substitutes or extra beans, resulting in some rice, vegetables and a thin swipe of refried beans. Not very appetizing.   I asked for medium and it was beyond mild. They also didn't put guacamole on it and when I asked for some on the side were going to charge me extra.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Despite being in a pretty convenient location on College Street, I would urge you to walk a little farther if you're seriously in need of a burrito fix. The food is decent at best, and it becomes worse when you look at that $8 price tag for any form of meat burrito.   The environment is pretty bland and unwelcoming. If you're in a rush, feel free to grab a burrito and sit at one of their plain, stiff tables. However, if you have some extra time to walk, there are plenty of better burrito places downtown."}
{"text":"Clean, nice atmosphere, fresh ingredients and reasonable price. Love this place."}
{"text":"Don't be expecting a burrito from mexico (or even expect mexicans working there) but more like a shawarma wrapped in a tortilla rather than a pita.    If I were you, go get a shawarma instead at half the price with the same size portions.    Obviously this place isn't out to attract customers, business is slow, the decor is horrendous and the food is subpar and overpriced.      Would I go there again?  Probably never!     Could this place do better!!  Of course but there's a long way to go.     Lastly, can't a Californian find a decent burrito place in Toronto!  Where's a Baja Fresh or Chevy's when you want some FRESH mexican."}
{"text":"Had a pretty poor experience here on Wednesday.   I asked if the did a burrito bowl. It wasn't clearly on the menu, but I figure it's just the same stuff in a bowl, so why not ask? The guy at the cash was really nice and said ok. One point for that! He said he would have to charge for for a large, but I was willing to give it a go. $10.12 later, someone started on my dish. Now, I started having misgivings right away, but having already paid on visa, I felt awkward retracting my order. The female staff put literally a tablespoon of sloppy bean liquid in a styrofoam take out container (Big Fat Burrito in Kensington uses a reusable/recyclable plastic container. Styrofoam is crappy.) She then sprinkled a tablespoon of rice on top. I'm looking at this huge container which will be my dinner, and which cost me over $10 and I'm seeing hunger. So I asked if I could have a little more (please sir/mam!) she denied me, but the guy who rang me in told her to put more in. She kept asking him, are you sure? Finished off the bowl with shredded iceberg lettuce, a smidge of tomatoes and red peppers (a tongs worthm maybe a tablespoon or two?). The portion of chicken was decent, but it was quite salty. Very salty. But the guac. Oh, dear, the guac. It was thin, and in a squeeze bottle. This was not guacamole. This was a thin, pale imitation. Literally. No flavour, it was a real let down.  So, in other words. Not going back."}
{"text":"Maybe their fish or meat burritos are good, but the vegetarian burrito I ordered was the worst of bland Canadian faux-Mexican.   The cook and other staff were really nice, though. So nice that I had to sneak 1/3rd of my remaining burrito in the trash when they weren't looking."}
{"text":"I think I've found the most nutritious meal around UofT. Make sure to always go bowl and ask for an extra serving of beans but less rice. This way you get the most fibre and protein out of your meal, keeping you full for a long time.  You're paying a bit more here than subway... However keep in mind that their chicken is real chicken, steak is real steak. No processed meats.  This place is bodybuilder heaven.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Judging from the other comments, this place used to be California Burritos and has since been changed to Burrito Planet. I am reviewing for the place as it is now (Burrito Planet). I believe it has been this way for ~1 year.  The burritos here are delicious! The chicken and steak are the most common, and go for 6.95 for a regular and 8.95 for a large. You get the choice of a whole wheat or white tortilla. Fillings include refried beans, rice, tomatoes, green peppers, guacamole, tahini sauce, mild/medium/hot salsa, cheese, and lettuce. A regular is definitely a good lunch and a large should fill you up for at least 4-5 hours.  The other burritos they have are vegetarian, shrimp, lamb, salmon, and beef bolognese. All are the same price as the chicken and steak except for the lamb and salmon which are $1-$2 more. I've never had these so I can't speak for the quality of them.   They also have the option of a quesidilla for $7.95 and fries for $4.95 (it's a very large portion, enough for sharing between 2-4 people). They also have a good variety of drinks.   Overall, this is a nice place to get a filling, decently healthy meal without spending a fortune or wasting a lot of time. They have enough tables and chairs to seat everyone who comes (never seen it be too full to not seat someone).  Servers are friendly and try to get to know people who come back a few times. Definitely worth a visit and probably one of the best places for university food within a kilometer radius."}
{"text":"The chicken and steak burrito was okay for around $8. Definitely not the best burrito I've had, but it was very filling and rather large for the regular size. But it was salty and even though they say that guacamole is included, there was very, very little of it actually in the burrito, which was very disappointing.   A decent food option if you're looking just for something quick to fill you up."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why theres so much hate for this restaurant but considering that utsg tends to lack many good restaurants (unlike ryerson) I was considerably impressed with this and I began coming here often.  They recently renovated and now they have better displays for the menu. I asked for a bowl of hybrid (steak and chicken) and it came with everything I ever wished for. Usually guac costs money but these guys give it to you for the meal. What really stood out with the meal was the sweet corn that they sprinkled. man its so good. They recently got new sauces for the bowls which include garlic and some other sweet sauce which gave the bowl tons of flavor.   I will be coming back soon and they are very nice and respectful to their customers. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is alright, a little pricey for the worth of food you are getting but it gets the job done by filling you up.  It is close to campus at UofT which is good for the go when you have classes."}
{"text":"2.5 stars So for all y'all who hear Cali burrito and immediately expect greatness, you should realize that this joint is not necessarily trying to deceive you! At least 5/10 times, your Cali Burrito experience (at least in the Bay Area) will not be much more inspired than what you will get on College St.; Re-fried beans look as they do here (in fact at times they will look like this in even some of the famous places such as el farolito http://www.yelp.ca/biz/el-farolito-san-francisco-2 ). Guacamole can also be found in squeeze bottles, but this will be a less frequent violation in a place of decent repute, and regardless of the vehicle of delivery, the guacamole will likely not be as runny as the one served here. In terms of the taste, my burrito somehow tasted more like a wrap at pita pit than a burrito but I've had much worse food around College/University! The portion was decent, and the major issue I had was holding the damn thing together (the watery sauces didn't make things very easy). Overall I would say Cali Burrito measures almost 3* for serving food that is relatively fresh and healthy with little wait time right across from University of Toronto. The options in the immediate vicinity of the university have seldom been known for those qualities, and in fact Cali Burrito is a very tiny step up from the shawarma shop it has recently replaced."}
{"text":"I don't know where these burritos come from, but it certainly isn't California. Time for the Burrito Whisperer to weigh in.  When I walked in here there were 5 people ahead of me. There was instant confusion when I walked in. I joined the line right inside the door. After standing for a minute or two a customer let me know that you have to go to the other end of the counter to order and pay first. This could easily be avoided with some \"order here\" and \"pick-up here\" signs or written on their chalkboard that spans the entire length of the counter. Really the issue here was that the line wasn't moving so you couldn't readily determine which was the start and which was the end. This should have been my first clue to not go any further with this place.  I ordered a regular steak burrito (well, at least what these guys call a burrito) and joined the line of 5 people ahead of me. After a few minutes two more people were in line behind me. The line was growing and still not moving.It quickly became evident what the issues were. First, they had skipped someone in line so there was confusion as to whose burrito was whose, which language barrier along with the big glass partition only seemed to help fuel. Second, they had run out of chicken. It was 12:20 and they had run out of chicken and had to cook more in the middle of their lunch rush. I use the term \"lunch rush\" lightly as the university is still on winter break so they're probably not as busy as they normally would be.  While waiting in line I witnessed when three customers had their burritos made wrong. Again, not sure if this is a language issue or the fact that the glass partition is 6' high and the workers can't actually hear what you're saying. Nevertheless, the customers didn't bother correcting the workers as the whole experience seemed to be an exercise in futility.  Lets walk through the burrito itself:  Re-fried beans - paste of some sort that probably came straight out of a can, maybe some spices mixed in, but you can't tell.  Rice - you get a very small portion. Not sure what the flavour was, but it wasn't good. Cheese - shredded miscellaneous blend which includes cheddar Tomatoes Onions - uncooked, raw Lettuce - They grill their burritos so probably best to skip the lettuce Salsa - choices of mild, medium, or hot. Hot is not hot at all. Sour Cream Guac - There is a green sauce in a squeeze bottle that they call guac. Clearly it is some sort of processed goop that probably comes in a bag. It's almost neon green, not a natural avocado green. It's also flavourless. Meat - I went with the steak. The steak was cut up into such tiny pieces that after it's cooked it's dry and flavourless. There's no real presence of spice.  Just when I thought Burrito Boyz/Banditos were brutal for grilling the crap out of a burrito, California Burrito comes in and steals the show. They don't grill the burrito on two sides, but THREE. And boy do they make sure they're grilled. Sorry people, but 20 minutes is too long to wait for a burrito.  This isn't the worst burrito I've had (See BarBurrito) but there's almost nothing good about this place. The only good thing I can comment on is the decor. I like the look and feel.  California Burrito should die a quick death, but I fear that their proximity to students looking for cheap food will keep them alive longer than they deserve.  Also, the state of California should sue these guys for slander for tarnishing their good name."}
