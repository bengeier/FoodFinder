{"text":"The service was great, the food was very fresh and filling. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"35/40 TVS, great live music on fri/sat.  Wonderful food."}
{"text":"Solid place....a TON of TV's for NFL Sundays.  My buddy has a band (Shout) and they play here at least twice a month.  Pretty big bar too.  Bartenders are always nice.  My gym is in the same plaza and damn it if I havent been tempted to grab a beer or three after a work out."}
{"text":"One night we wanted to play some NTN Trivia and have a meal.  We turned to the 2011 Entertainment book for a coupon.  It was either here or West Park Station.  We chose here...  And now I know why the Strongsville location closed.  The Southern Sizzler Burger burger was okay but had very little of their \"tremendously popular Southern Sizzler sauce\" on it.  Had it had a reasonable amount (more than a teaspoon) it most likely would have been good.  They did seem to have a produce problem - My tomato was soggy and my wifes lettuce on her salad was old.  The service was decent. Sat us immediately. Food arrived quickly. Refilled drinks timely.  Unfortunately, When we tried to use the coupon the server brought it back to us and said the manager stated it wasn't valid tonight. What's the deal? It didn't state that on the coupon. What are you trying to pull?  After complaining we were able to use the coupon - without an apology or explanation.  They do have 35-40 TV's but are only only comfortably visible if you sit at the bar.  All of the TV's at the bar appear to be from 1996 and are not of great quality.  If I were looking to watch sports this wouldn't be my choice.  Don't let the entertainment book be your guide.  Trust Yelp."}
{"text":"I use to go to this place all the time over the years,  but the last time I went here I felt like a stranger and felt totally disrespected the way the owner treated me.  If I can remember the owners name which is Ed(guy in the picture), I've been there enough times with some buddies of mine and for some reason he can remember them but not me.  It's sad when a bartender can remember you and treats you with more respect then the owner.   But now to why I lowered my rating.  The prices have gone up over the years and the only thing worth getting are the daily specials.  The quality of the food also isn't as good as it use to be.  I could just name one item but it ranges from the fries to the wings to the sandwiches.  They were all better years ago.  I don't mind the raised prices but cutting corners on the food quality I'd have to say that's a shame.  Oh and the service was also terrible the last time I was there as they got my order wrong as well and I didn't say anything about it because the food took forever to come out.  As for myself I won't be coming back unless my friends drag me back..."}
{"text":"I came here after leaving Front Row across the street, because Front Row seemed to only have cheap man beer.  Harpos was definitely more happening and exciting, and with a much better selection for beer.  It has two levels, lots of cool Cleveland sports stuff, and a lot of seating at the bar and throughout the rest of the place.  It was a great place to be for a Cavs playoff victory!"}
{"text":"Wow. Where to begin? How about I quote some wrestlers since i came here to watch the WWE Royal Rumble pay per view. Hulk Hogan would ask \"watcha gonna do, when Harpo's slathers their wing sauces all over you?!\" I don't know the first thing about contemporary wrestling, only watched it as a child. But a good friend of mine, who plays a mean kazoo, invited me to this mammoth event at an even more mammoth sports bar. Sports bar does not even do Harpo's justice. It is a multimedia menagerie of sports and food on par with some Roman spectacle. A wall of tv's behind the bar must have been a hundred feet long with about as many screens. It hurt my frickin eyeballs! Then there are screens behind you at every booth, on the way to the restroom, on your plate, in your napkin and probably behind the joint where they dump chicken grease. If you miss a moment of any event, you must be asleep. Rick Flair gives this setup a giant \"woooooooooo!!!!!\"  The place was packed more than i've ever seen a bar. Even for playoff games or presidential debates. Lots of kids(whose enthusiasm for the event was insanely infectious), grown up wrasslin fans and yes, even some ladies. I ordered the Harpo's golden sauce wings. Very generous helping(more so than some pizzerias i've been to lately) and tangy with a bit of bite. I also had a gin and tonics(dirt cheap, but didn't taste like it- i think they used the good stuff). My wife had giant onion rings and a chocolate bomb cake. Total tab came in just north of twenty. We were shocked. Very good bargain. The Iron Sheik was there(not really, my friend brought his action figure) and he said that Harpo's was the best bar outside of Iran.Yaahh!!  Service was very slow, but you had to cut these kids a break. Each server had close to fifty people to attend to from what i could tell. The kitchen might have been backed up as well. It was that packed in there! But they still hustled and accomodated every table around us. I don't think anyone was displeased. The place got louder and louder as the main event approached, and by the end of the night all you could hear was \"OHH!\" and \"BOO!\" as each steroid stuffed grappler delivered blow afer fake punishing blow. Enormous fun. Wrestlemania is there in two months. Totally going, or Macho Man will drop an elbow on me."}
