{"text":"I would spend my last $3.50 on a Frank's Bratwurst sandwich - hard roll, light 'kraut. It's the best $3.50 you'll spend in Cleveland. An institution for good reason. Long live Frank's."}
{"text":"i've realized i pretty much only give out 5 star ratings, but that's probably because i don't really like to review places i don't really enjoy.

frank's is a staple. everytime i go to the west side market i have to get a brat or sausage. it's cheap, you get to choose soft or hard roll, and they've got cheap small fountain sodas. the combination really hits the spot when you're hungover on a saturday and you said you'd go to the market with someone early in the morning. it's the right amount of food to put in your stomach and not be too full to try all the other great stuff that the area has to offer."}
{"text":"Frank's is the real deal ... the crispy skin almost \"pops\" when you bite into it.  Perfectly cooked.  Depending on the day, it's either a soft roll (Cleveland's favorite \"Diamond Jim\" from Nickles Bakery) or a hard roll.  Don't forget to ask for some horseradish too ..."}
{"text":"A Cleveland staple. 

I've been eating this since I was a child and I don't have any desire to eat a brat that isn't from Frank's. It's simple (soft or hard roll, kraut or no kraut) but that's what makes it so amazing and classic. 

Super nice family that owns it. 

Whenever my brother comes into town, a stop at Frank's is mandatory. i want to eat these forever."}
{"text":"Certainly the only way to eat lunch (or breakfast!) while perusing the Westside Market. In fact, even if you have no reason to go to the market, you should stop in for a CHEAP Cleveland experience. The sausages are fantastic.

To order at Frank's you better know the bratwurst language:

Hard or soft? (roll, that is)
Wit or witout? (kraut)
Brown or yellow? (mustard)

Or, order like a local: \"One hard, wit, brown.\" You'll be eating in seconds."}
{"text":"Authentic no nonsence sausage, served on hard or soft rolls.  What's not to love about a 8:00 AM grilled, spicy piece of processed meat.  Can't wait for a return visit."}
{"text":"Been going here my whole life.  For 42 years I have been eating these bratwurst.  They are awesome.  No trip to Cleveland is complete without them.  I now even get the frozen ones to bring home with me.  Love the bratwurst but love the family who has this stand. They know my order by heart even though I now live out of state and only go once a year.  Miss this and you have missed the eat of Cleveland."}
{"text":"When I'm at the Westside Market you will find me standing in line for one of Frank's Bratwurst. I like to keep it simple so I can enjoy the flavors of the bratwurst. You definitely want to enjoy this on the fresh hard roll it is the only way to go, don't worry about it being too hard or tough it's always fresh, tender with just enough chew to the roll add a little mustard and walk way so you won't be tempted to order another. Ordered plain its $3.50 you'd be hard pressed to find a better one at any price."}
{"text":"Great brat sandwich and a very reasonable price. Perfect for grabbing something on the go and shopping at Westside market."}
{"text":"There only a few places at the market that are serving hot food.  I would recommend this one.  You can get dogs, kraut and brats.  Make sure to get a hard roll.  There is no place to sit down and eat so get this first before you shop."}
{"text":"This stand is nestled in the heart of west side market. I made a bee line for this joint (esp after the owner kindly responded to me within a day about what type of meat they use. It's 100% pork btw). 
The hard roll with horseradish, spicy mustard and kraut is key. The brat is very juicy and actually mild flavored. You can eat the whole thing easily without your mouth feeling greasy or belly uncomfortably full. 
My only comment would be that the casing could be a tad crunchier but really that wouldn't stop me from devouring another one!"}
{"text":"This is what you'd expect from a cooked food vendor at the market - good, cheap, and fast. I'll take a $3 brat over a $7 gyro any day of the week (excluding Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, of course)."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this stand since I was a kid.  In short this place is an INSTITUTION.  Nothing frilly or fussy, just a great sandwich done old school style.  Whenever I make it out to the WSM my first stop is Franks for a Brat on a hard roll with Kraut, Horseradish, and Stadium Mustard...  

A+ 

I wish I had one now = \"}
{"text":"This place is an institution. When ever I visit Cleveland, I try to pay the WSM and specifically Frank's a visit.
Brat, a small amount of sauerkraut, stadium mustard and horseradish = perfection."}
{"text":"There's a song about these incredible brats inside the West Side Market (not to be confused with the Bratz inside any given shopping mall).

It's called \"Relax\", and it's by \"Frankie Goes To Cleveland.\"

Relax!
Get Bratwurst!
When you want eat sausage!
Relax!
Don't share it!
You'll be left with none!
Relax!
Don't drop it!
Then you're left with none!
But please save me some!

What to get: A Brat
What not to give birth to: A Brat
What my girlfriend is: A Brat

One of the most famous and yet unheralded, underrated places in Cleveland. Unheralded as in, how the f*** does this legend only have 25 reviews? Are you kidding me Yelp? That's what I mean when I say Yelp doesn't always \"get it.\" If this was the gourmet hipster grilled cheese place (cough Melt cough) it'd have 573 reviews by now. AT LEAST. But Frank's. Oh Frank's. My Frank's. So delicious. So unheralded.

And that's what you get from a place named after Frank E Muniz, Frank Ophile, and Frank Salott.

In the corner of the world famous and historic Old West Side Market, this little stand is serving up the most delicious bratwurst on rolls that you can imagine. The people giving this place 3 stars or less, I just can't with you. I just can't. 5 star price, 5 star service, and one of the best Brats I've ever had. Don't forget to add sexy spicy mustard to it. It's just soooo good.

Still, what do you expect from a place named after Frank Zappa, Frank A Sessment, and Frank N Stein.

Perhaps there might be one Brat seller hidden away somewhere in the state of Wisconsin that is superio,  but for the most part you will not find a bratwurst that tastes this good. Charcoal Inn South (Sheboygan, WI) is probably my fave, but that's because of the massive fresh dollops of butter they put on there. For the Brat itself, this one is as good as any, and better than the vast majority. If you are in the WSM and not vegetarian, you simply, unequivocally have to try one.

Anyway, what else do you expect from a place named after Frank Sinatra, Frank Ocean, and Frank O Phone.

They're also filling and dirt cheap, so as I say, if you are in Cleveland you simply must give it a try. I know you will be possibly more drawn to be same hipster stuff that you can find in Williamsburg and San Francisco, but bear with me and come to the West Side Market and try this - along with a lemon sugar crepe from du luxe, and some spicy jerky from czuchraj. And if you like those three life-changing items, hmu and I'll give you a nice list of other life-changing Cleveland eats... and there are many.

But what do you expect from a place named after Frank F Urter, Frank Sfornuttin, and Frank Leemadeer. 

I don't give a damn."}
{"text":"Hard roll and kraut with Stadium Mustard. Aw man, you have to have one! If only they served beer."}
{"text":"Hard roll with spicy mustard.  Add saurkraut if I'm feeling crazy.  Family owned...same people there since I was a baby.  I feel like I've grown up with the kids and now see them taking over.  This place is by far my favorite place in Westside market.  Everything is consistent and perfect everytime.  The price doesn't seem to have changed in over 25 years as well.  A perfect sandwich for 3 bucks?  Yep"}
{"text":"As a tourist visiting Cleveland, a trek through West Side Market is a must.   We found Frank's (and Frank's II) tucked in a corner spot of the building.  Franks does the bratwurst; Franks II does the sausage. This is a really great lunch spot!

I went with the Italian sausage (with peppers and onions) and it was fantastic.  It was served on a hard roll (recommended) and I added some spicy brown too.  The sandwich was pretty cheap ($4) and made for a great lunch while strolling through West Side Market."}
{"text":"I went to school in Cleveland and this is one of the great Cleveland memories I have. 

The taste. The snap of the casing. The mustard. The Roll. I'm not playing around, this is as good as bratwurst can get. A real west side market treasure. I'll be back there in the fall and I can't wait to get mines!!!!"}
{"text":"Hard roll with brown mustard - $3 and complete happiness. This is street-vendor styled food at its finest."}
{"text":"Holy moly this bratwurst is to die for! When he was making it for me, I thought this is going to be boring. A bratwurst cut in half on a roll but I was completely wrong! I should have ordered another one but my calorie counter said no!"}
{"text":"The next (third) generation of this family's stand is now cooking the wurst.  Another magnificent example of Clevelands humble ethnic eats.  Get one.  Or two.  Eat on the market's narrow but scenic \"balcony\" against the west wall. (W.25th side)
Entrance and stairs by the w25 main entrance.  Grab an extra napkin, especially if you get kraut with your brat."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best bratwurst ever.  The brats were cooked perfectly and were served on a hard roll that was baked to perfection! The bratwurst were so good we went back for a second round! The people behind the counter were so nice and friendly. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"If you're at the West side Market, you gotta stop here. I always buy 2, one to eat then and one to eat later. You won't be disappointed. You'll thank me later.... with a happy mouth."}
{"text":"This was bar-none the best bratwurst sandwich I have ever had either in the US or Germany. They got everything right - the hard roll (do not get the soft white roll) was perfect, not to tough, with exactly the right texture and chew. The bratwurst itself was perfectly seasoned, cooked and butterflied and had just the right snap. The condiments of horseradish and the delicious local favorite Bertman's ballpark mustard top it all off.. It's a must try - an A+ sandwich by any standard."}
{"text":"So we see a bunch of people in Cleveland's marketplace hovering around this little shop...we see bratwursts being handed out on bread...and some a little sour kraut.  We think to ourselves how good can that really be?!

WOW...that's how good.  It's a flavor explosion!  One of those moments you have to pull it away from your face and examine it closer then look around at other people with that head nod and noises of approval and amazement.  

Wowsky is what they should rename this place...loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating these brats since I will a little girl!  And it never fails to satisfy me regardless if I'm hungry or not!  Bratwurst, sauerkraut, hard roll, ketchup and stadium mustard. Heaven and best childhood memories!!"}
{"text":"$3 for a bratwurst sammie.
$4 for a bratwurst sammie and sauerkraut. 
I wasn't a huge fan of the bread it came on because it got pretty soggy halfway through. But the bratwurst itself was pretty good. And for $4, that's pretty cheap!

Tip - don't forget the mustard!"}
