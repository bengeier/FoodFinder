{"text":"Rude. Called with a question, and before I could even say 2 words of it, she interrupted me with \"I don't know.\" Funny thing is, I know what question she thought she was answering, and that wasn't my question at all. I chose not to clarify as there was no point, I wouldn't do business here after that encounter."}
{"text":"I go to Green Valley right next to here and there are some extremely busy students, myself included, who have a short amount of time to grab a bite to eat before we have to get back to school. This is the only \"affordable\" place thats less than five minutes away, walking. Yes, it gets extremely busy after school and its understandable as to why the people who work there get to stressed out. Yet, they have no reason whatsoever to be as rude as they are. If you start to order without their consent, they get mad at you. If you're being a teenager talking with friends over some ice cream, they get mad at you. They are extremely rude. The only reason why I keep going is because I dont have the stomach to go until eight, sometimes nine at night with nothing to eat since lunch. Also, students are not permitted to use the restroom with out a parents permission. Oops. I have to go to the bathroom but they do not trust me. Too bad. I do not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My receipt shows a time stamp of 5:07PM when my order was taken. I pulled off into the parking lot so that I could figure out how to contact someone, because it was now 5:23PM. I cannot believe the level of complete disregard for me as a customer who has made MANY trips to this location in the past with friends and family. The person I initially spoke to was a girl (no name tag, did not get her name on the receipt, unless it it Dean F which is what it states) She got irritated with me when I did not look up long enough to watch her flip a blizzard upside down. I understand this is something they have to do, so I let that slide.   TEN FULL minutes and a line of cars behind me, not a single person came back to give me the rest of my order. People looked at me as they walked by but no one ever questioned as to why I was still sitting there. Finally a very sweet girl (different from the first one) came and asked if I was still waiting for something. I said yes and requested to speak to a manager. He had a complete lack of interest in a customer requesting to speak to him (I watched him walk by three separate times). They were not busy beside the line that was accumulating behind me. Instead of even letting me tell him what my issue was, he said, \"Receipt?\" And waited with an open hand. I was flabbergasted. As someone in management for years, I worked my way through the toughest of guest situations with an empathetic and caring ear, regardless of how small it may have seemed to me.   I stopped him and told him I needed to understand what the delay was. He sighed and asked \"Can I just refund whatever your order is? We have a line.\" I couldn't help but laugh at him, thinking how if I had spoken to guest the way he spoke to me, my job would be on the line. You represent your team more so than anyone else there, and this is how you choose to speak/react? I recommended to him that he find himself a way to be re-trained because the customer always should come first, especially the one that has been waiting for upwards of TWENTY MINUTES when this was all said and done! He then CHOSE TO ROLL HIS EYES and said, \"Alright, uh-huh. Thanks for the feedback,\" and laughed as he closed the window.  FYI, I refused a refund and planned to just contact someone at the corporate level. Wether this location is a franchise or normal chain, it is absolutely ludicrous to me why he would have acted the way he did. This manager's name was Jeremy and if I had anything to say about it, he would be fired immediately. The entire rest of the staff would be better off with someone who understands the concept of real leadership. They could do with further training in how to properly handle any type of guest situation as well."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Ordered a chocolate strawberry blizzard, they tried to give me a chocolate strawberry shake. Fixed the mistake, should have stuck with the shake. They were in such a hurry to \"fix\" their mistake that I got one strawberry and a sorry amount of chocolate. My husband ordered a medium butterfinger blizzard and ended up with an small Oreo blizzard. We are ended up throwing everything out. At least they got the pup cups right???? What a waste."}
{"text":"They stuffed 4 meals in a small package and crushed everything an decided to substitute cheaper hamburgers in place of our Grill chickens. They also continue to bring out your soft serve ice cream in Arizona five minutes before they bring out the rest of the meal so that your Sundays are nice and melted kind of like milk. They also proceeded not to listen to me and feel my drinks instead of me doing it with a broken hand I called the manager on it then he proceeded to ask me if I wanted him to read back the food he already crushed stay away from this place."}
{"text":"We were asking the clerk Arriana if we could by a royalty blizzard at regular price and use are coupon for a free blizzard. Common sense they would make more money by doing that than us buying the small blizzard. Arriana was extremely rude and sarcastic. The manager came out Christina and apologized but at this point we no longer wanted to eat there. We are the customer and Christina did not try to make it right with the CUSTOMER! I asked for her card to make a complaint and was told there was none. They just lost a valued customer."}
{"text":"Love DQ. Blizzards are the best! Dipped cones were made to perfection and the service was friendly. The menu is a bit misleading about the \"guardian of the galaxy\" snack pack which shows pretzel stick and a mini blizzard in the same photo and all items weren't sent out at the same time."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse dq there is! We literally ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries. Burgers weren't even warm, cheese wasn't melted or anything. Ok cool they gave us new ones that were hot. Then it tasted gross. Like dirty meat! Idk what is up with this place but I couldn't even finish my food. Reminded me why I don't eat fast food!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. DQ is nothing if not consistent. However, it seemed like the poor girl at the cash register, who was extremely nice, had been completely abandoned by her coworkers during the afternoon rush.  The young man working the drive thru seemed to be only wandering around and could have helped out (although I don't think I would want him touching my food, judging from the filth on his shirt).  I heard people laughing and joking in the back of the kitchen, yet this young lady still got no help. And where exactly was the manager on duty? In my restaurant days it was part of my job to dig my crew out of the \"weeds.\"  Apparently they do not closely monitor their staff or volume of business throughout the day. I would suggest a technique known commonly as Management By Walking Around.   Also, my friend came out of the men's room (while I was STILL waiting to order due to the fact that there was insufficient staffing at the counter) and told me that there is a cheeseburger on top of the paper towel holder. I think the manager might want to take a stroll through the bathrooms a bit more often.   On the bright side, the fudge-filled cookie ala mode is amazing, and the dining room was very clean."}
{"text":"Filthy!! Disgusting!!  I recommend that this place be closed down, before someone gets sick. Walked out the door immediately! No pics."}
{"text":"I was craving for some ice cream and came upon this DQ, big mistake. As we walked in their were 3 employees chatting, no biggy. No friendly welcome, that's fine. As I was ordering the young man took my orders, but was totally not paying any attention because as I was ordering he was busy talking to the other employee making the ice creams. The other employee left to talk to some chick. Anyway, I ordered a chocolate covered strawberry sundae, ehhh where the heck is the strawberries? There were only 2 small pieces of strawberries.  I am never going back to this DQ, they are rude and can't even get an order right."}
{"text":"By far one of the cleanest Dairy Queen which is a plus for me.   My coworkers and I had lunch here since we were craving for some Blizzards, so Dairy Queen was what we all voted on. I ordered the chicken strips basket which came with fries, toast and 4 chicken strips. I also ordered a Butterfinger Blizzard, which was delicious and satisfied my craving for some ice cream and candy.   The staff was really friendly and asked if we wanted our blizzards after our meal so it wouldn't melt. I also order my coworker a blizzard since he couldn't come with us and the lady put in the freezer so when we were done we can just grab it."}
{"text":"boyfriend and I got the $5 lunch meals.. the girl made sure to ask what type of sauce I wanted, I said bbq and then drove away after we got our food. 10 minutes later I open my bag.. she forgot my bbq. and the fries are nasty."}
{"text":"I came here today an wasn't treated very well I waited in line an they let a family skip me. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Perfect for a cheat day. Love going there and love taking my kids there! Always a friendly staff. Been there a lot of times and always had a positive experience"}
{"text":"Great food and courteous service.  Despite a huge rush of people, the DQ delivered a great burger and Blizzard.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting and cold here. When we got home (we went through the drive thru) we were repulsed by the mediocre quality. When I called to complain about my order the manager said \"Well we don't advertise that our food is fresh.\" REALLY? I will never take my business here again especially with this stupid manager."}
{"text":"Clean, quick, friendly service. All three guys working the counter were fun to chat with while we waited for our blizzards. The store was very clean and they cleaned as they worked. I appreciate the speed we were served. Great experience! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The ice cream for our blizzards was served at a temperature that was warmer than normal.  The worker put kids on the blizzards before she brought them out and did not turn them upside down to demonstrate the thickness.  I'm positive this was done because she knew they were delivering a substandard product.  My dipped cone was oozing down the side as soon as it was handed over to me.  This was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We love Dairy Queen and the fact that this location is within walking distance of our home this should be a perfect summer shop.  They have forever lost our business.  Last night we encountered rude employees and a manager who doesn't understand the concept of customer service or manners.  I ordered the new \"royal blizzard.\"  With this there was the smallest squirt of fudge on it.  When I inquired about it the person working behind the window simply rolled her eyes and shrugged her shoulders like it wasn't her job to make a quality product.  My husband ordered a blizzard.  The treat was literally served to him dripping down the side of the cup.  Neither treat was served with the upside down guarantee.  When we inquired the manager simply pointed to their menu board where they had covered up the corporate policy.  When I shared our experience she simply did not think there was anything wrong with her employees demonstrating a lack of customer service.  It was not a problem that they were serving a sub-par product.  With this lack of management I can understand the employee behavior.  With new ice cream shops popping up down the street we will be visiting everywhere but Dairy Queen in the future."}
{"text":"another pretty good dq , the patrons were the ones who got me irritated the most standing over my shoulder while I wait in line, ha oh well, ice cream is good I picked up a box of em, service was cool too"}
{"text":"On 6/11/16 I bought a  groupon for the ice cream cake so I ordered the cookie dough blizarrd cake from dairy queen on S maryland pkwy Las vegas but when i picked up the cake it looked nothing like the picture they have on website. Looked like a child decorated it also no cookie dough inside the cake. I Asked for manager they said no one avail until 6/16. I called and left my phone number for a return call but of course that didnt happen. Called them on 6/14 I got a so called manager by the name of q he told me on the phone to return the cake and he will refund my money when i got there on 6/14 at 615pm i asked for q but no one answerd there was 2 guys and 1 girl behind the counter so 1 of them said since i bought groupon cant refund my money only the difference. I said that isnt what you told me on the phone. I want my money back he said he cant so I Asked for the owner the guy said he my dad. ok well get ur dad on the phone. He refused and walked to the back never came back up front the other guy was very rude said im your not getting your damn money back and to take the cake with me and just laughed. I said then i want the difference he asked for the debit card because he wasnt allowed to give me cash but then throws my debit card and cash on me and walked away saying I ain't dealing with this shit. How do you allow ur employees to treat ur customers like this. They wouldn't give me the owners name. I've never been treated this way. They lack customer service and no empathy. How do you allow your employees to curse at your customers? I'm still in shock from the way I was treated and just how the so called manager just walked to the back and didn't handle the situation. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I've been going to this DQ for 9 years. They continually show good service. Great blizzards and food. I would recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Service was OK (they weren't very busy though), ice cream treats were good.  The burger we got was skimpy and unappetizing.  The main turn-off for me though, was the SMELL!  The restaurant smelled like old grease - so much so that I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Then we went to the ladies' room to wash our hands, and it had such a strong smell of urine that I had to hold the door open while we used the sink.  Grossed out, and won't be back!"}
{"text":"Considering how much this location has gone through to get where it is now, I'd say they've made great improvements. New management took over a few months ago (or a year, I don't know--I've lost track of time. lol) and they've been fighting very hard to get to where they need to be. It's not easy working in Sun City--probably one of the worst when it comes to working with the people there--but the service takes it in stride! They're tough, and they do their job. I don't mind eating there."}
{"text":"Long time fan of the orange Julius!  I tried an ice cream cake from here recently and it was so good!!! yum!!  Clean & friendly store too!"}
{"text":"Good workers but Not enough. They need to hire at least three extra people for shift. More workers, more people through the drive through, more money."}
{"text":"I have only gotten the mini banana split blizzards here, but they are always on point!    Also want to point out that their menu actually has the calorie count listed on the drive through, which helps tremendously when you are counting calories.  At 300 calories, the mini blizzards are a great treat that you can have without feeling too guilty!"}
{"text":"Service is as slow as frozen molasses. There were 3 families in front of us in line and we waited aver 30 min just to get to the counter them another 10 min to place the order. The only saving grace is it at least didn't take that long to get the food. This is hands down the worst service I have ever had at a Dairy Queen. This will be the last time I visit this location."}
{"text":"If you order a banana split, make sure you don't want a choice of ice cream or toppings. You will be told how a banana split is made. No nuts and no cherry. Hummmm, wonder who instructs the employees on customer service. I am not a fussy person, but I know how I like my banana split. Home made is better anyways! Done with DQ!"}
{"text":"Got a flamethrower. Saw what looked like a hair hanging out the bottom. Needless to say I did not eat it."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Been meeting friends here for years. Havent noticed if service is slower or not, as it gives us all a chance to catch up! Service has always been friendly! Ice cream always good!"}
{"text":"They always get it right. Thanks DQ. Muahz!!!!!!  But you need to bring back s'mores blizzards.  I miss them."}
{"text":"As far as Dairy Queen franchises go, this one is sub-par. The servers are a mix of old ladies and what seem to be highschool children and they don't always bother to mix the blizzards adequately so you end up with big blobs of vanilla soft-serve in them. The counters and such always look pretty filthy, covered with dried spilled ice cream and so forth. Its strength is its the only fast food ice cream parlor in the area so it'll probably always get business."}
{"text":"The service was not even ok; the whole staff was rude and looked like they didn't want to be there. Then it took over 20 minutes to receive my food; and when I finally did receive it everything was cold & my bf order was wrong. The bbq sauce which wasn't requested was placed inside my chicken meal and had some white liquid on the label. The fries (probably contaminated by the white stuff) tasted cheesy and smelt sour. I was so completely dissatisfied by the service and the food that I did not stay to order my fudge cookie a la mode, which was the sole purpose of my trip. I will no longer be coming to this dairy queen until it smells proper and the staff is trained."}
{"text":"Ive been to this dairy queen a few times in a span of 3 years. Ice cream is originally dairy queen ice cream but the meals aren't so great. The meat is always chewy and they skimp on fries. I also don't like when they hand you the ice cream while you wait for your meal, it always seems to take a bit even when its not busy and your ice cream is half melted."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for ice cream after getting back from Wickenburg. We hadn't been here for awhile. Ordered 2 medium Blizzards and to our surprise the cost was over $8.  They were made well, making sure the candy was mixed well and not all on top or bottom. However, Sonic's is cheaper, and McDonald's is even cheaper. Sorry not gonna repeat-times are tough."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Had a Carmel peanut parfae and he had the new strawberry cheesecake royal blizzard."}
{"text":"I went in here yesterday afternoon, I was very disappointed with the customer service, 3 kids behind the counter who seemed more into them selves rather than attending customers.. Store was dirty,and not to mention, I waited  about 7 mins to finnaly get my order due to a mess up on making my drink. I would probably recommend this store to younger kids who have nothing better to do with their lives.. This is considered a fast food joint for a reason and that's to provide fast food!"}
{"text":"I've been getting chocolate dipped vanilla cones from Dairy Queens for over fifty years.  The one I got at this store was barely acceptable.  The coating was anemic and incomplete.  They need to get someone who knows how to make this product correctly.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? Just bought 2 cones & size was about 1/2 normal size! We've purchased this item at stores elsewhere & those were generous servings, but this is ridiculous. This is the worst excuse for portion control ever. Go to another store!"}
{"text":"Slow, incompetent workers. Frequently mess up orders. I love DQ, not this location though..."}
{"text":"We stopped by on Easter Sunday after church, about 11:15am. They were not busy as I believe they must have just opened. We went through the drive thru & brought the food home... big mistake!  The ice cream was excellent as always BUT the 2 burger combos were horrible! The burgers looked & tasted like they were made the day before...they went to the dog. Even the buns were cracked & dried out!!! I now wish we had eaten inside so that we could have returned the food! After paying nearly $30.00 for this meal & the only edible thing is the icecream, I will take our business elsewhere! DQ is usually know for really delicious quality food but NOT at this location!!!   I gave 1  1 star for the employee who was really nice & upbeat!"}
{"text":"We just left empty handed.  There was one person in the back working and nobody at the register taking orders.  It's around 1:30 so you would expect better service for lunch customers. Really disappointed because there are not too many Dairy Queen's around."}
{"text":"Such great customer service, I love coming to this Dairy Queen because I can always count on a clean environment with great ice cream! The manager and staff are so welcoming whenever I come in.  I love the blizzards, hot fudge sundaes, and the hot dogs are amazing as well! I give this Dairy Queen five stars, which I rarely do."}
{"text":"Food was hot. Employees were polite however working in fastfood they should be wearing a hat and be shaved. Also no Heinz ketchup was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The staff is slow,   The bacon on the burger I found hard to believe that it was real. Over all disappointing."}
{"text":"If you're hoping to grab a quick ice cream and then hit the road, this is the wrong place for you. The staff lacks supervision, this is obvious by all the screwing around and blatant disregard for customers. The entire team needs to get with the program. I get it mostly teenagers work here, but here's a tip-- don't leave these people alone for a second! Or be witness to a water fight, we were so lucky to see a waterfall that just spilled out all over the floor in front of the register. Ah-mazing!"}
{"text":"Customer service is usually decent, but they close the machines down early and claim it's getting cleaned. For weeks now they've had different excuses for why they can't give me chocolate soft serve."}
{"text":"Very slow !!! Also the blizzard was not serves upside down .. Pretty sure should have got it free be Nope sure didn't !"}
{"text":"I really like the Royal Oreo blizzard. 1/2 of the time order one they don't put the fudge core in. They always charge me for it though."}
{"text":"This location is ok. The tables were dirty and ice cream was runny."}
{"text":"Went to this DQ and there were 2 employees there. One was Nicole who had probably the worst customer service etiquette I have seen in my life...she was rude, loud and obnoxious and had a very sarcastic tone and she even snatched right out of my hand and yelled at me about taking a golden spoon that they had prominently displayed on the main counter with all the other spoons...The other was Briana and she was a delight and pleasure to deal with and she kept apologizing for her coworkers behavior ;)"}
{"text":"The owner of this place is rude. He talks to everyone like they are kids. Even though he is the owner of this business he acts like he is doing you a favor when you come there to buy something. I feel that his behavior reflects how the management treats the employees. You can feel the negativity in the service. The first time I have eaten ice cream and not been happy. Next I time I will get my ice cream from Frys."}
{"text":"Sorry Dairy Queen. I visited this location when I still lived with my parents in the late 1980s, and have been back several times in recent years, mostly when I worked at Southland Business Park and wanted to get out for a quick lunch for fast food.  Quality has degraded to the point of inedibility. Hamburgers, once cooked fresh, are now pre-cooked and microwaved, bun, condiments and all. Disgusting. I wrote the Dairy Queen to complain, and they wrote back to lie about it, calling their devices 'warming ovens' or some other corporate double-talk. So not only did they serve me bad food, but they also assumed I was so stupid, they could talk me out of realizing it was bad.  Ice cream sandwiches are often made up in advance and left in the freezers for days (maybe it is weeks), becoming hard, even to point of forming ice crystals.  Seems like nothing is served fresh anymore.  For a decent hamburger, cooked fresh, to order, you need to avoid these franchises like the plague. Go to Burger Inn, or Boogie's Burgers, or even a sit-down restaurant like Denny's. It's sad that DQ has declined so badly when it would be so easy just to cook the stuff fresh and maintain a reasonable standard - other restaurants are doing it, with very little effort."}
{"text":"Terrible service I strongly suggest hiring a new friendly staff that listens to orders!! I went through the drive thru and the employee on the window had a very rude tone \"is that it\" she kept saying after every thing I ordered got to the window no greet no you're welcome no have a good night nothing took about ten minutes to finally come back to tell me to pull to the front for my hot food I ordered meanwhile she gave me my ice cream to sit and melt not to mention I ordered an extra scoop of ice cream with my brownie and peanuts I got a huge pile of ice cream over filling the container instant mess every where and no peanuts then I ordered a peanut butter cup blizzard she gave me a butterfinger one not sure how they sound the same? Needless to say I got home and was disappointed by the entire order being wrong and melted"}
{"text":"NO BURGERS OR FRIES!  Walk-up stand   Pretty neat to see my second walk-up DQ in the Queen City, but not cool at all when I still cannot find a DQ that serves up those awesome flame-grilled burgers and really good fast food fries to complement the blizzard effect.  Sad that I had to resort to hitting McD's a mile down the road instead for the burger craving.    Still got the hubs a chocolate milkshake here. They've changed shake cups (and decreased them in size), and even with a clear plastic cup the staff still didn't manage to mix the bottom part of the shake up well enough."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous! Complete waste of money and a VERY disappointing birthday treat for the family.  Like other customers complained, the blizzards were already melting when they handed them to us. The price is also a bit on the high side (almost 4 bucks for a small... and I mean SMALL).  My wife had to eat more than halfway through hers to find any cookie dough.  I tried my son's Oreo and it was about as good as Breyer's ice cream-- except he got a mere 6 oz instead of 1.5 quart.  Avoiding this place from now on. It's a ripoff."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with a DQ Blizzard. Great location right across from South Park Mall.   Today they also did a fundraiser to help Children's Miracle Network (2 thumbs up)!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location since 2006!!!   I love DQ from a cone to buster bar. I recently learned that they sell vanilla and chocolate ice milk in cartons!  The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Just go here for their desserts. So many times, including tonight, have I eaten here and found my fries and chicken to be lukewarm to cold. They also have half their sodas out of order every time."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to this location the blizzards are completely melted. Most of the time they don't flip it upside down to show that it is frozen and thick like they're supposed to, and when they do, they tip it half way and the whole thing almost pours out of the cup. Each time i day something an excuse is made like, \"there's just a lot of liquidy stuff in it\" and I'm stuck with melted ice cream. Haven't been happy with the blizzards in a very long time."}
{"text":"The service here is disappointing. When I approached the counter, and asked about a blizzard that I didn't see on their menu, the two employees looked at me blankly, and then looked at the people behind me. Then one employee walked away. When I ordered, the employee that served me had to clarify a few times the size and flavour I requested. The whole staff seemed spaced out and seemed surprised to see customers on a hot summer afternoon. Also, this location doesn't offer most new menu items. In fact, they charge more for 'creating' items that are clearly advertised on the website."}
{"text":"On Saturday I paid cash for a dipped waffle cone and watched a kid with dark hair take my money, give me change and then make the cone while touching it.  Missing the hand washing step completely.    When he tried to hand it to me I asked him if he realized he handled dirty money before the food.  He shrugged and asked if I wanted a new one.  I said yes of course.  He walked away, dumped it in the trash, half heartedly washed his hands and made a new one.    I prefer my ice cream without the attitude and germs."}
{"text":"DQ should pull this franchisee from it's brand. Where to start,expect drive thru to take your order after the car in front of you receives their order so about 10 min. They can never get your order correct,employee Anna needs retraining after telling me before she makes my order I better be sure to like it because she wont remake it or give my money back SERIOUSLY !!! finally received my blizzard runny with ice cream all over outside of cup asked for napkins twice to even grab the cup.Obviously this owner is not active in his investment.  THE WORST DAIRY QUEEN  FOOD AND SERVICE !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst DQ in the area. My family and I have been here time and time again HOPING for some kind of improvement and we always leave disappointed. An order is always messed up, and forget ordering a sundae-They fill the cup half way and charge you full price.  The other local DQ's are much better and we will be driving the extra distance from here on out as we've officially had enough of this place."}
{"text":"omg. 6 people in the lobby and a clerk that only runs in first gear. no one comes from the back to help.. we are out of here!"}
{"text":"647pm on a Wed and the shut down the Chocolate ice cream machine for cleaning... Isn't this dinner time????"}
{"text":"I have never had Dairy Queen cake before, so I was extremely happy to order my husband a birthday cake from there.                                                                   Problem After Problems  1. Online it mentioned you can pay in the store 2. The young lady that called me could not comprehend simple directions, so I paid over the phone no big deal.  3. I placed directions for my cake online and I spoke with her over the phone to explain how I want the cake done. This was 2 days ago........  4. I picked up the cake 8/14/15 and the two guys couldn't find my cake. I waited for 15 minutes in the front and the guy finally asked me what was on the cake. I told him it had a Dallas Cowboys Star on it. My cake did not have a star, and it did not include what I wanted on the cake. It was very embarrassing that I had to show him that cake.  5. My husband cut the cake and it fell apart REALLY......... It was a disaster......... It had cookie crumbs as a cake......... I could have ordered from Smiths and it would have been better. Next time I'm going to have Fat Boys ice cream.  I will never visit this location again & I will not recommend it to my family or  coworkers."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Horrible!! Horrible!!! What a way to celebrate national ice cream day!!! Bad customer service!! Blizzards melted!!! Waited 15 mins at the window after paying to get out blizzards!! One didn't even have toppings inside!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst dq I've ever been to...I bought a birthday cake and the lady ringing me out didn't provide me with a bag or utensils. That's fine, maybe she forgot, so I asked for some but she said they don't sell bags or spoon/forks. Really?! If I just got a $3 blizzard I would get a spoon with my order, but if I get a $30+ cake they not only don't provide spoons but don't even sell me a few?!! I had to ask twice and she finally unwillingly provided me with a few spoons. So ridiculous. Will not be back here. EVER. She said we don't sell spoons to you! What????? Even I go to Panda and don't buy anything, they will still give me a spoon and chopsticks!"}
{"text":"Have not been here in such a long time. Went there got such great ice cream. But the service there was horrid. The all seam to hate working there..."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen: Queen of queens of dairy.   Coming here always takes me to my happy place. When I was a fat kid, I was often denied chocolate dipped cones from DQ by the parentals. Whatever, look at me now. I can get one whenever I want one. Pfft.  I don't like complications, so I typically order a small or medium cone.  If I wanna live a little, I'll get the dipped cones and sometimes an Oreo Blizzard. ALL. BOMB. One of the girls who works there always swirls the ice cream really high. I don't know how she does it. Talent and a lot of practice and spilled cones, I guess.  Staff's never been a pain in the ass, unlike some of their neighbors in food court row. Not naming names, but one of those places rhymes with HUBIOS.  Wouldn't recommend this establishment to the lactose intolerant."}
{"text":"Live very close to this DQ and frequent it, maybe too much. Nevertheless, everytime we go in, they are very helpful and are always smiling and friendly. Had a $5 lunch there today. I was quite impressed with the amount of food, it was hot and the sundae that came with it could have been a whole meal for me! Across the corner is a McDonalds and from now on, I will choose the DQ EVERY time! And love, love, love the Dilly Bars!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!! I came there to get ice cream for the family. When I walked in I said \"hey\" to everyone being very polite and cheerful. As soon as I walked in the guy who did my order did not have a smile on his face and than a woman named \"Jillian or Jillian\" made me a banana split instead of a blizzard. When I informed her very politely she slammed the banana split on the counter and walked away and had someone else make it. I than seen her taking others orders and she was not smiling or anything and I heard a customer tell his wife that she could have least smiled. After I got home we didn't have nuts in our blizzards like we asked for and PAID for. Than the blizzards had holes in them and the leaked all in my car through the bag. Once I seen that I was fed up because of what I went through there. I called the office 5 times and got no answer so I drove back over there to speak with a manager. When I got there I spoke to a manager named \"Vickey\" and I explained to her how horrible the customer service was and than she had the nerve to ask me for a receipt, I didn't mind but the fact that I told the young man I didn't want one. Than I pointed out the young woman who was rude , and the manager said \"well she's been here since 9:00am\" and I told her no matter what time you should always have a smile on your face. Because I work at a doctors office and start at 7am to 7:00pm. I use to work at Dairy Queen 4 years ago and I know how it is. But the fact that your manager was rude and didn't even apologize or have the young lady apologize was disrespectful. I go to diary once or twice a week and this was my first experience that was horrible. Wish I could give ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Was craving a Boston Cooler so we decided to stop in Monday night. I noticed that the soda selection did not include Vernors(key ingreadent) to what I came for, so I asked the man at the counter, who happened to also be the owner, if he had the means to make one. He was dissapointed to infprme me that he couldnt , however quickly told me all the thinkg he could make me and asked what else I would be in the mood for. As by bf joined me I was still uincertain of what I wanted at the point. Wemordered a cherry freeze, colcolate brownie blizzard and an orange julius. We sat down and when our order was ready the owner came to our table and deleivered the drinks!! We asked him a few questions about how business has been and so on, he was friendly and upbeat! We LOVED the pride and ownership that he showed, usually you find young kids running places like that but with him being there it gave the place an at hoime feel and we sat and ate our frozen treats and was nothing less then 100%b satisfied!! We will def be back ... most likely too often!!!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with warm smiles and hellos. The place is clean with lots of friendly staff. Perfect for our after dinner treat!"}
{"text":"I accompanied my sister today to purchase some blizzards for our family. It has been years since we've had DQ, with that being said we were unfamiliar with all of the new flavors. Asking the lady through the intercom, was futile. The lady was unprofessional, uninterested in helping, at one point she told my sister that underneath the big DQ sign is the menu. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and appalled that anyone would respond to any customer in that manner. My sister further informed the person at the window of the incident and recommended they take further action against the rude employee. The person at the window as well as the manager were laughing and did not take her complaint seriously. To make matters worse our blizzards and shake were done horribly wrong. I will not revisit nor recommend this Dairy Queen to anyone."}
{"text":"My major complaint with this franchised Dairy Queen is their stinginess. I've never encountered anything like it before. They thin down all of their shakes and blizzards (they don't participate in the upside down challenge because it would NEVER pass) as well as their gravy. This might also be why their sodas are always flat. They skimp on ingredients, as another reviewer pointed out with her blizzard. I've ordered a basket with onion rings substituted for fries and literally received 3 onion rings. I've ordered medium sundaes that are the size of dog dishes at other franchises. I've ordered 4 piece chicken strip baskets and only gotten 3 pieces.  Until today I hadn't eaten there since 2007, but I thought \"hey, why not.\" But they're still pulling the same crap. I would rather drive to the Gibson City DQ than give these people another dime.  As a franchise, they're entitled to make decisions about their business and its resources. At least, that's what Dairy Queen corporate customer service will auto-respond when you complain. But the owners of this franchise are not in any way representing the DQ brand, and I don't understand why the brand doesn't have any recourse."}
{"text":"Came thru drive thru. Told the girl 3 times I wanted gravy.  Even at the window I said are you sure it's in the bag?  Oh yes she said.  Well, no gravy in the bag as I drive away.  I had to pull around and park, go inside and there it was on the counter.  She saw me and said oops!  No apology.  I spent 32.00 there that night.  This place just can't get it right.  Must be poor managment.  Food is good.  Service is the worst."}
{"text":"1 star because this Dairy Queen supports and pays \"Wheel Blockers\" to monitor their lot. Biggest scam of all time. Went to Lunchbox Records then to Dairy Queen to find a boot on my car not after even 10 minutes. The man 'Jay' was so rude and inconsiderate. He gave me such a hard time about parking there and after I had to pay $50 to get him to take it off, I sat in my car in the lot and watched him go boot multiple other customers cars that were going into DQ. I will never EVER again patronize such a business that supports this scam of a company."}
{"text":"June 12 4:15pm,  went inside to order.  Was hit in the face with the smell of Urine,  stood alone at the counter for almost 10 minutes,  no one - not one single person said a word to us, they saw us but ignored us. The smell was so bad we went to the Drive thru,  the prices were high but we got our food.   The Wife got Chicken Strips and I got a Cheeseburger,  later that night we both were sick.    Then June 18 9:04pm, went to the Drive thru for 3 Blizzards and 2 cheeseburgers / fries.  The price was insane,  $35.00!  I asked the guy in the window if that was right and he said let me check.  Fair enough. While I was waiting I was looking inside their store,  and it was filthy to the point of being gross.  There was melted Ice Cream, little Candies and crushed nuts all over the Food Prep area, there was food on the floor,  and what seemed to be water spilled on other flat surfaces.  Not from anyone wiping the surfaces off.  There didn't appear to be anyone cleaning anything.   I got so grossed out, I just got the Blizzards and skipped the food.   I was in shock,  I have never seen a place that dirty."}
{"text":"this is the most terrible Dairy Queen I have ever been to. I found a small insect in my blizzard. I am astonished because my friend just recently got fired for not \"sanitizing\" the plates enough, even though she put every plate in the sanitizer. they're concern should be BUGS IN THE ICE CREAM. ew"}
{"text":"Ordered a double cheeseburger and got everything but the patties. -_- you wouldn't think that's something you would need to check."}
{"text":"The quality and organization of the DQ is disconcerting to say the least. I would not visit this DQ except for proximity. I have asked for an Oreo blizzard with extra Oreo every time. 70 % of the time the blizzard is partially melted and 50% of the time the extra Oreo is not added. In order to insure proper service, it is recommended to go in and order. Do not use the drive through. Every time that I have used the drive through, the order has always been wrong or under serviced, such as getting partially melted ice cream.  * Poor service * Partially melted ice cream * Incorrect orders are frequent  Do yourself a favor, do not visit this DQ if you have another close by."}
{"text":"Fast & Friendly service BUT the dinning area was a little cramped but it's like that in all ice cream shops so who cares.  It was A Very CLEAN store.  The chicken finger basket was good & hot, but the fingers were very small more like half of a finger.  The texas toast & gravy was forgotten and then when I did get it it was not even toasted more like texas bread.  The blizzards & cones were awesome as always.  So Management you need to go back to the chicken fingers you used to order because these were not worth it."}
{"text":"Need a quick fix for a soft serve chocolate dipped cone or a Blizzard... this is your location in the east end.  Located at the top of Pottery road this DQ has an amazing view of the city at night.  Just place your order and grab a seat on one of the many benches overlooking downtown.  This location is one of my fav \"rest stops\" after a night of riding mountain bikes in the Don Valley trail system.  Not much I can say about DQ since this place is pretty much standard all around, but service is generally quick and I've always left with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"A great product but the service aspect really needs some leadership at this branch.  I stood in line for nearly 20 minutes tonight.  Being only the second person in line I had to leave in frustration.  The teenagers working were only interested in talking amongst themselves.  The customer in front of me went around to the side and yelled to ask whether they were open.  That worked for them.  When the same thing happened to me, I had to give up."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had at a Dairy Queen. I was charged for another customer's order that was $5 more than mine. While the $5 difference is less than favorable, I became more frustrated when employees told me \"sorry bro, we can't get you your money back because we have to contact our supervisor and he isn't picking up his phone right now.\"  The employees were one of the worst I've ever seen or dealt with. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Ordered medium chocolate shake. Super watery and not much chocolate.  $4 down the drain. Done with a dq that can't even make a shake.  Drive thru smelled like sulfer."}
{"text":"Man I love this place....qhe. they say uve never sewn a DQ like this one before thwyre telling the truth...its gorgeous! Its one of the cleanest food joints around....I have been going here for a long time and the service and food are what brings me back. They have a GREAT handle on what customer service is and you'd think you were In a full service restaurant by the way they treat you.  The managers are always around and their kids are always rocking out orders. The drive thru is always packed but they keep it moving pretty well. I have found that if the drive thru is busy u can usually get served pretty quickly inside...so if its more than 6 cars I go inside and get out quicker than the guy that would have been in front of me. Just a great bunch of kids all around they have really done an awesome job when I'm there...don't get me wrong, they will have the occasional mistake and if u bring it to their attention it is ALWAYS fixed beyond my expectations...that's what I like, when you go to other places n say ur burger has ketchup on it when it shouldnt, they make a new one n send u on ur way whereas DQ takes it personally (they should) and will fix the issue and take it a step further to ensure you're happy...the one time I did take my burger back because of the ketchup, they brought me out a brand new burger and made it a combo for me for free and I got dessert on top of it. Keep up the great work DQ, you've got a customer for life!"}
{"text":"I just went there the other day for the first time in a long time.  Great staff! Outgoing,  friendly and efficient. Although, they forgot my soda it was fine with me, because the service was excellent. When I called to tell them I didn't get my soda they told me to stop in and i could get either a soda or a sundae. I'm happy. We all make mistakes."}
{"text":"Each time I have gone here the blonde girl always messes up my Heath Blizzard. It's a simple order and yet it tastes nothing like the Heath blizzard.  How could you mess this up?!?!!  She mixes vanilla and chocolate then pours in the Heath bars. But it's not supposed to taste like regular vanilla or chocolate ice cream. It's supposed to have a different composure. Idiot. Second time I been here and they have no idea how to make their own recipes. Come on it doesn't take a neuroscientist to do this job!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this dairy queen 0 stars I would.  Ever since the ownership changed hands it's been such a disappointment. They do not care about having satisfied customers at all. Their cake selection is a joke I had to get one for my daughter's birthday and it tasted freezer burnt and the decoration was poor quality."}
{"text":"The staff is nice which is the only reason I gave 2 stars. My husband found a hair in his blizzard and being the nice guy he is said it's no big deal it happens.  Until he found a second one... in the same blizzard! They also didn't give us all we ordered and charged us for something we didn't get! We have tried this place a few times to see if it gets better but it doesn't. Worst dairy queen ever.  I can't wait until the one on Greensburg road reopens!"}
{"text":"We bought a box of buster bars and paid 17.$ and some change @ shawnessy DQ.  Then we bought some at the DQ Deerfoot Meadows for 12.$.  So I called shawnessy location and was confirmed that YES, they in fact DO sell theirs for 17.$ as each location is owned separately and can charge whatever they deem fit!!!   We will never support them ever. That's outrageous!!!  5$ difference?  Tonight at silverado, the buster bars were 12$ there as well.  Cannot believe it!!!!    Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"shawnessy Dairy Queen charges 17.00 for a box of buster bars...silverado and the one by ikea charge 12.00.   ridicuous!!!!   apparently the are individually owned and can charge whatever they want...ridiculous.  Guess where ill never go back!"}
{"text":"Really Fast Service, clean and organized lobby. Staff was very friendly as well. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"0 STARS. This dairy queen is horrible. The employees do not know how to do their job. Completely disorganized and not clean. It took three employees to ring my order up. Corporate needs to review this shit hole of a store."}
{"text":"We waited in the drive through for about 15 minutes for 2 blizzards. We finally got them only to get home and realize that the Oreo blizzard tasted sour.  We called to tell them and they said we could come back for a new one but by that point we were grossed out and didn't want to wait in another 15 minute line."}
{"text":"If you've got that tickle for something sweet, this is where me and the hubs [drive-thru] to satiate the sweet tooth. I haven't tried any of the burgers or any non-dessert items - but their soft serve in any form is just what the doctor ordered.  The blizzards in the mini size is just the right amount, the small is certainly shareable, and the medium or large is if you feel like living on the edge or eating your daily calorie allotment all in one sitting. And don't forget the different types of candy in the blizzards you can choose from.  If you want to go the simple route - i go with a chocolate dipped vanilla cone - which also comes in varying sizes.  I think the greatest thing about dairy queen is it evokes memories of summer or hanging out with friends and/or family and is right around the corner from home."}
{"text":"Always sloppy service.... and you expect a tip...   For what?  Incorrect orders? Sloppy items?  Charging for an extra topping and putting the $ directly into the tip jar?  Id recommend management clean house and start over."}
{"text":"Drive thru line was crazy long for a Thursday night at almost 10 o'clock. So that maybe the reason my order was wrong. They were also out of the cotton candy blizzard, which was disappointing for my boyfriend. And to add to it all they discontinued the mint flavor!!! Which was my personal favorite. Oh and not like it's to important but our blizzards weren't severed upside down."}
{"text":"I agree. I was not allowed the restroom but they did take my money. Don't come here if you are a high schooler"}
{"text":"I was in line for more than 15 minutes waiting for my order. When I got my twist ice cream dipped cone while driving home the ice cream tasted biter/sour. Threw it out and called the store to notify them.  the clerk who answered the phone tasted the ice cream from the machine stated that the ice cream tasted okay and didn't even offer to refund me my money. Never going back again. I can still taste the bad milk in my mouth as I'm writing this.  Ps they don't even deserve this one star."}
{"text":"This DQ is the worst in town menu does not state all of the up charges that they ask for. A full bate and switch, will never come here again and might skip DQ al together from now on"}
{"text":"It shouldn't take ten minutes for two small blizzards, not even a \"your order will be out soon\" or\"sorry for the wait\" or \"thank you for your patience\" I understand it gets busy but that's just ridiculous, I didn't feel like being a asshole because that wouldn't have helped with anything, hope management or the owner whip the workers into shape but then again this is the fast food industry not exactly people who are serious about their craft lol I'm rambling now, anyway I really hope they take forever next time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Tried to use a buy one get one free coupon that dq had emailed me...and the manager couldn't figure out how to do it. And then wouldn't honor it, even though it was clearly valid."}
{"text":"Awful service. Never going back. I live nearby and stopped for a cup of water as I was out running and the trail leading to my usual fountain was closed. They said it would cost 25c. I said fine I would swing by later with the money as I am a neighbour and a regular customer. They said no. Fine. Then the \"boss\" came by and they suggested I ask him. I did. He said no. I told him that I am a regular customer and if that's how he wants to treat his customers that I wouldn't be returning with my family. He proceeded to raise his voice and get upset with me and proceeded to yell. I filmed the incident. I will never be back.  No shortage of good ice cream joints in the area for my kids.  I get that it costs money for cups, that's fine, but the yelling was unacceptable.   Based on other posts it seems like the service is an ongoing issue."}
{"text":"Very clean and well run. Food was cooked to perfection and very tasty. I recommend this DQ and the bathroom was clean as well. I take this as a sign as to some of the places I've eaten at up north in Neepawa."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant for blizzards for myself and my wife.  There was a fairly long line and only one cashier taking orders.  The line would get longer but no one came to open the 2nd register.  When we finished placing our order, my wife asked to speak to the manager about the long wait time.  His response was \"if we added a 2nd cashier, you would have to wait longer for your food\".  How about more help on a Saturday nite?  There is usually more staff at busy times.  Has their policy changed?  When the blizzards came, there was ice cream running down the sides of the cup--couldn't someone have used a napkin or cloth to wipe the sides of the cup?  Seems like service is going downhill at this location."}
{"text":"wow peanut buster parfait sooooo bad..more nuts then ice cream so salty rude staff..not one bite of ice cream without a nut so did not hit the spot"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and was not greeted.  I said \"hello?\" and finally was asked for my order. I asked for a chocolate cone with sprinkles and got no response again.  After about 45 seconds I stated \"that's all\" and was told to go to the next window.  I then sat at the window for about 10 minutes before I was greeted by an employee.  She opened the window and asked if I ordered food.  I told her my order again.  She closed the window and walked away with no response. After another 3 minutes, she returned with my cone, and took my money. I said thank you, and got no thank you in response.  The restaurant was not busy as there was only 1 other drive thru customer, and no patrons inside.  I will now be getting my chocolate cone at Rita's Italian Ice."}
{"text":"Ok. Wow. This place is so SLOW!! And got my order wrong!! I don't always rely on bad reviews just because everyone has their own perspective on things. But geeeeeez - I should've just trusted them this go around. ?"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this location has such low ratings. I have never had an issue when I  viait, which is pretty often since it's by work. For as long as I have been coming here the staff has always been great. Friendly and personable...always smiling. They are a little slow but I think that has to do with them not holding you chicken strips and fries under a light for hours a a time. Prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Awful service. Went through the drive through, sat and waited, then was asked to pull to the front of the store. About 10-15 min later, food finally comes out and once we get home, order is wrong, food was cold and blizzard was melted."}
{"text":"What is with the employees at this place?  We have been here a few times because.... well I'll be honest.... we're Blizzard addicts and it's the closest DQ to our house now that the one on Tropical closed down.  But if we weren't the hard core Blizzard fans we are... I would NEVER give this place my business.  Every time we walk through the door, the teenagers working behind the counter act like we are irritating them with our very existence.  One night we got there about 45 minutes before closing time and as we were sitting there trying to enjoy our ice cream, they put up all the chairs onto the tables around us and kept staring at us like we were keeping them late.   Seriously?  This place needs some kind of management to step in and whip the employees into shape...  Or I might have to start driving all the way down to the DQ on Tenaya and Alexander.  At least the employees are friendly there."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food  and always very clean....this is especially impressive since this DQ sits right across the street from a High School and a block from an Elementary School!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is the worst i have ever been to in all my Dairy Queen  visits and I have been to many all over the US.  It is absolutely the dirtiest establishment I have ever been to and  my last visit  resulted in being so disgusted by the condition of the  counter and restaurant I left without making a purchase. I don't think I have ever done that before. I would think twice before eating anything from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible.  I signed up for Yelp JUST to review this sad excuse for a Dairy Queen.    My wife, daughter and I ordered 2 regular Hamburgers, 2 small fries, a 1/4 bacon cheeseburger and an onion ring.  After a long wait, the manager gave me the three sandwiches and 1 fry and the onion ring.   I told the manager that I ordered 2 fries and she pointed at some monitor above the food and corrected me as if I was trying to steal fries.  I said, \"whatever\"...I didn't care about the fries if I didn't pay for them.  I was tired of waiting.  So, I get in the car and head down the road (now late from waiting) and BOTH small cheeseburgers were cold.  Not room temp.....they were COLD.   I opened the bacon cheeseburger and they forgot something.  THE BURGER PATTY!!!  It was a bun with bacon and lettuce.  I found the nearest turn-around and headed back to the DQ.  When I showed the manager the sandwich with no burger, she looked at me like I was trying to get over on her....like I ate the burger part and wanted another one.  I just shoved the burger at her and walked out.  I didn't want the shady staff spitting on anything she would have offered me, anyhow.  NEVER AGAIN.  If they don't like customers they should just put a sign outside that says, \"You'll get what we give you and you'll like it!!\""}
{"text":"This place is the definition of repugnant. I understand when a mistake happens once or twice when it is busy, but I have gone here multiple times and during those multiple times, my order and the service have been not at it's best. For example, I have ordered fries and they told me it was going to be a few minutes because they make everything fresh, but when I got the fries, they were cold and undercooked. Secondly, when I order a blizzard, the amount of toppings in very light. Thirdly, filthy filthy filthy. I am not surprised that I saw a C rating in their lobby. Overall, I will no longer go out of my way to this place is to eat."}
{"text":"Oh jeez I hate it when spring roles around and the drive through starts to smell... If you go to the drive through, be ready to keep your windows up because the grease box in the back STINKS... ugh - going through in a convertible to satisfy my oreo blizzard jones was enough to ruin my appetite.   Service is OK except in two cases, which unfortunately happen often: 1) a crowd of people inside; or 2) some in front at the drive through ordering multiple items.   To be fair, all the ice cream items (why order anything else at DQ?) are fine, as good as any other DQ. But the outside stench at the drive through and slow service limit me to only two stars."}
{"text":"My sister and I were going through Boulder City and decided to stop at the local Dairy Queen.  We were quite impressed by the cleanliness of the restaurant compared to a Dairy Queen we frequent in Las Vegas.  The employees were all very professional and extremely friendly.  And of course the ice cream was up to Dairy Queen' s standards......delicious!!  Miki K."}
{"text":"Dont go there if you want Blizzard. They barely put the flavours you opted for. Ive been to most of the Dairy Queen in Montreal, as a fan of Blizzard, avoid that location. For the rest, they are fine"}
{"text":"Has been awhile since I went to a Dairy Queen.  Used my birthday coupon for a free blizzard.  I am glad I had a coupon.  While the blizzard was good their prices are way too high.  I can get a sonic blast for a lot less."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen will always ask you if you would like extra toppings in your blizzards, you will always say yes, they will always charge you the extra price, and you will NEVER get the extra toppings."}
{"text":"We just got a couple cherry dipped ice cream cones and they were almost white we thought they just didn't dip them good enough because most of the employees don't, but this time it was like eating wax. This Dairy Queen is BAD and even the stuff the managers make are terrible.   Find a better location or place to go!!"}
{"text":"After my daughter's soccer practice the family and I decided to get some dinner.  Drive thru speaker wasn't working properly so a man came out to the car to take our order. Upon paying $35 for the three of us, drive thru cashier asked if we could park in the front of the restaurant because our order wasn't ready and there were cars behind us. After waiting 23 minutes, my wife went inside to see what was taking so long just to witness our food being handed to another drive thru customer that went inside to see why his food wasn't ready. The man gave the bag of food back to the worker and said he didn't order this food, my wife said that was our order. The angry customer demanded his money back and got a refund and left. Finally 26 minutes later we got our food. NEVER AGAIN, will I eat here!"}
{"text":"This is THE Dairy Queen in the Madison metro.  Notice how the Sun Prairie location has no reviews....because nobody goes there.  Anyway, they have a very strong selection of on hand ice cream cakes, if you are looking to pick up a surprise for your special lady on the way home from work.  They are generally pretty busy probably due to their south Fish Hatch location, so its not the FASTEST place on earth to get a cone if that's what you want.  They have all of the standard DQ delicacies.  The prices are standard.  I gave it four stars because I give a regular Brazier three, and this is the best one in the Madison area, as stated."}
{"text":"No matter what time you go in, it is always slow. 4 people in the drive thru and you spend 15 minutes waiting for your order. Go inside and it takes 20 minutes to be acknowledged. Tonight we ordered a sundae and a blizzard in the drive thru. The kid (quiet voice, corn rows) repeated both items and only handed us one, look at the receipt, he only charged for the sundae. Sat there for a few more minutes to get the blizzard, he refused to come near the window until we pulled forward."}
{"text":"Really bad service take them for ever to make something and the blonde girl who makes the blizzard f**ked up our order not just once but two time come on you only have ONE JOB"}
{"text":"Worst Dairy Queen! Not connected to the other parking lots. Both streets are divided. Had to make 2 uturns in order to get into the restaurant. Went through drive through. Was asked to pull up n park because our food would be a few minutes. Got home n all of our food was cold and one burger was so cold the cheese wasn't even melted. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Didn't even want to give a 1 star but you have to. Service was below average. No welcoming spirit,smiles, NOTHING! Older lady who works on Sunday is very bland and just looks at you like your crazy . Another family came n she was all smiles, when she noticed that I was noticing her rudeness with my family and I said something to my husband and daughter she tried to do better. And the other younger girl that works along side her doesnt have any life about herself either. This was our first visit at this Diary Queen and we were not impressed AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service at all. When we asked the cashier if there are any options we can get dairy free, she responded in a snarky voice, \"water?\" This was definitely something we weren't expecting, and we will not be returning. The Dairy Queen in the ghetto has better service!!!"}
{"text":"Did lunch here today. Ordered the grilled cheese iron sandwich kids meal, which came with fries, a soft drink and ice cream. The sandwich was fresh, hot and crunchy but tasted bland...the fries were decent and the cone was okay,  although I think McDonald's makes a creamier better-tasting vanilla cone. My daughter liked her chocolate dipped cone and thought the fries were good but not as good as Wendy's. I can't say the food was bad but I can't rave about it, either. The restaurant, however, was clean and I enjoyed the oldies playing on the radio."}
{"text":"Just left this DQ and horrible experience. Carlos working the window seemed to think it was ok to try and give me a melted ice cream. I ask him if the ice cream was melted as I watched him  wiping my ice cream from his hands and counter top he responded with giving me a thumbs up and told me it was ok  and tried to hand the mess of a melted ice cream."}
{"text":"The Cameron store clerk is very rude! The store entrance glass doors are very filthy .. I was commenting as a buying customer and was rudely spoken to by Cameron . I will report to the health Dept as well"}
{"text":"The service was horrible...cashier overcharged for ice cream in a cup instead of a cone (I was charged for a sundae). That was corrected but the order was wrong and the manager huffed when I said the order was wrong...ugh! Needless to say I will NOT be returning here!"}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in, for a quick meal, last Sunday night. We all ordered the $5.00 lunch that they serve all day. The lunch included a decent size burger, a good helping of fries, a medium size drink and small Sunday. Plenty of food for us. The service was good, the food was good...what more could I ask for?  Will be back."}
{"text":"I have given this place a chance on numerous occasions. Every time I have ordered a Blizzard it has been given to me melted. Not sure how that even happens. Food order has never been correct. I will not be frequenting this establishment anymore."}
{"text":"The owner makes great blizzards... unfortunately the second that he steps away his staff makes the \"lazy blizzard\"... stuff on top with vanilla ice cream for the bottom 2/3... I've watched him go through it step by step so it's unfortunate they choose not to listen"}
{"text":"This is Dairy Queen - and you get what you want here. I don't come here often, as I try to control my sweet tooth, but when I do come here with friends, it's a satisfying experience. Service is fast, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Everything from the start to finish of my order was wrong!  We walked into the store and stood by the register for 3 minutes before someone came over to take our order.  I simply ordered 2 chicken wraps, 2 cheeseburgers, and two large blizzards.  I had to repeat my order 3 times for the cashier.  I handed her my money and when I looked at the ticket, she rung it up wrong and forgot my cheeseburgers.  When I went to get it fixed, I had to wait again for the cashier to notice me.  Finally she got the manager to fix her mistake.  When they finally handed me my bag (I told them \"to stay\") they forgot my wraps and I had to wait another couple minutes for them.  By the time I got my food.  Our blizzards were half way melted.  Now...my blizzard was grainy.  It was like they mixed dirt or sand into it.  And it had about a cup of pecans in it!  One bite had 5 or 6 pecans in it!  And my cheeseburgers had hardly no ketchup on them and about a tablespoon of mustard!  I definitely won't be coming back. I would have been better off going to the McDondalds down the street!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, their ice cream is ok. On busy nights drive thru is insane and impossible to turn left out of here. Prices are high too. The employees are really nice and it is a clean store."}
{"text":"Worst hamburger ever! I was brought an old burger that had been microwaved. I couldn't even pick it up for at least 3-5 minutes. Tasted disgusting. I asked how its was cooked and they admitted microwaving it. Then stated they could make me a fresh one. I thought that's what I ordered. I did get my money back. Shift leader stated it's not his fault. This was the way he was trained. I would never step foot in this DQ. Garbage!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times & have had good and bad experiences. So, I wanted to hold on writing a review. But now, I've noticed I have a great experience when the male manager, I believe goes by the name of 'Josh' or 'Jerald' (I am for sure it starts with a J). He makes me feel welcome at DQ, he doesnt treat me as just another customer. He asks me how my day is, and treats his coworkers just as nicely as the customers which I love. Now, I've noticed all my bad experiences at this Dairy Queen occurs when the other manager is there. She's a short, oriental woman and she's just rude. I've seen her treat the employees poorly which makes me sad because they're really nice and caring kids. She also disgusted me because one day as I was waiting for my to go order inside, behind the counter, I believe I heard the manager say something along the lines of \"Come guys there's still some left, why would you throw it away\" and heard the trash bag rustling. I really do not want to believe that she dug out something from the trash and continued to use it, however that's what it seemed. If it wasn't for the male manager being there, I would rate this 1 star due to the female manager."}
{"text":"They prefer white people, everytime they get the white people's food quick and fast and point out where the condiments are, when a coloured person goes there they make sure they take extra long and get the order wrong, some long haired dude making the food along with the staff are friendly to every patron when leaving except the coloured people who are watched like they are going to steal, avoid if your not white"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen barely functions. The last three times I've stopped in to satisfy a blizzard craving, I've left without ice cream because they've had some sort of equipment malfunction preventing them from serving. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I've experienced some pretty terrible service but the DQ at Higley and the 60 really took it to a new level. When I drove up to order I was told that their credit card machine was down and they were only accepting cash. In the meantime people pulled in behind me so I had to wait for the four other cars in front of me to get their orders so I could get through since I rarely carry cash. I know that it didn't \"just\" go out because we had tried to get through about seven hours earlier. At that point I gave them the benefit of the doubt that their machine just stopped working.   Seven hours later and no sign or someone standing there to let customers know...At the very least they could have ushered the cars through and delivered their food to the parking lot so others would be at least somewhat less inconvenienced. To add yet another layer of horrible service...I was told that there was no sign because \"if the machine goes back up and they get busy they might not have time to take it down.' Are you kidding me? You are absolutely right, it is much too much to ask one person to take 30 seconds to run out and remove a sign rather than inconveniencing probably dozens of people. I drove 10 minutes each way, waited in line for no food whatsoever, had to drive to and wait in line at another restaurant and become incredibly annoyed after a 13 hour work day.   They have a sign out front touting \"new ownership\" I think you may want to consider investing in some business and customer service courses, clearly common sense, or basic common courtesy, evades you."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had...there were 3 employees behind and counter and only one actually working. One employee that was taking orders was obviously frustrated and just suddenly stopped taking orders and went to the bathroom for over 5 minutes. This whole time no one else stepped up to take orders so a line was created, once the cashier returned she was extremely unhappy and sat down in a chair behind the wall so orders were not being taken for a good 15 minutes. Also when we FINALLY did get to order they messed our order up and we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for almost a plain ice cream....all in all I spent a total of 30 minutes at this Dairy Queen and I won't be going there again..."}
{"text":"This is a very nice new Dairy Queen that the owners moved from its location across the street a year ago or so. They have a drive through that doesn't move especially fast and the lines can get long on summer nights.  Probably no different from any Dairy Queen in the country in that regard.  Normally we get ice cream or blizzards there and they are always fine and up to Dairy Queen standards.  One time I got a burger there and it was delicious - big, juicy and home made tasting.  Three stars for your standard DQ, +1 for this place because it is clean and new and that delicous burger."}
{"text":"Went here for an Orange Julius. It was $3.50 for a medium and it didn't have any ice in it. It wasn't cold at all and definitely wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"When it comes to ice cream DQ does it right with out the mark up. I frequent this place often for a blizzard or chocolate milk shake. I don't go there for a meal. They always make a great chocolate milk shake."}
{"text":"Oh for the love of Blizzards!  Saw this owner/proprietor on the local news recently during a major hankering for ice cream which doesn't come very often. to my surprise the owner took my order and took the time to chat while i waited for my sweet concoction.  I ordered chocolate chip, pecans and coconut *(i know, u either love coconut or you hate it).  he said business is good even in this flat economy (probably owing to the incessant heat) and he employs clean cut teenagers that actually want to earn a buck rather than have one handed to them for showing up (take that, Target).  The pretty teenager suggested a blizzard mix of strawberry, banana and coconut next time. i said, can you really do that? mgr must have trained her well and said we can prepare most anything you desire....whoa, have i got a list of things i desire.  Try them, after dinner, or after a workout at the gold's in the same parking lot. They aim to please!"}
{"text":"Oh boy! This DQ is BUSY on the weekends! Yet, good customer service, great speed of service and good ice cream! My wife and I love coming here! Excellent blizzards (we love it when they turn the blizzard upside down) the boy at the window is very polite to us. I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"horrible place!! ordered a chicken sandwich with some french fry drive thru. my french frys had a gum wrapper in it and somebody's nappy ass hair!! disgusting... couldn't even take a single bit threw everything in the bag and tossed it. didn't have time to go back and complain i had a fussy newborn in the back. beware!!  thet hire punk ass teenagers with no respect.."}
{"text":"OMG the first Dairy Queen that I've gone to that actually got my order right the world is ending I can't believe it I had to write this review because every single time they screw up my order so really happy with this Dairy Queen thanks for the service and the girl was really nice at the register."}
{"text":"Used drive thru and when trying to explain my order a very rude and snobby teenage girl wouldn't let me finish speaking. You sell a service at least put on a fake smile and be pleasant to talk to . A lot of people need a job be grateful you have one"}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot for a late night treat, or even breakfast- yes I said breakfast LOL I've seen it done countless times, and have even done it myself xD The staff is friendly, with a few exceptions, and the line does move quickly. What I find especially impressive is the way the owners help to prepare the products when things get busy. Overall a great DQ"}
{"text":"DQ is a great place to grab a dessert and the best place of any of the other fast food establishments hands down. You have several options to go with, shake, sundaes, cones or my favorite (and many others) the Blizzard!   For those that don't know, the blzzard is ice cream mixed with your favorite topping or candy bar (Oreos, Twix, Butterfinger, Nestle Cruch, M&M's etc). A real treat!  Each time I've gone, the dessert has always been ready within in a few minutes. The one time I went through the drive through, we were in and out within 3 minutes.  I typically don't go to DQ to eat a regular meal. Once in a while I will get the chicken finger basket, which is a few chicken strips, fries, a piece of toast and gravy. Very Good!  The burgers are ok, but if I was in the mood for a burger, I'd hit another establishment. Just my preference."}
{"text":"Of all the Dairy Queens I've been to in my life in CA, TX and now AZ, this is the nicest and cleanest location I've been to. I guess that's what happens in Awhatukee.  The staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru.  I could eat Chicken Finger Baskets and Blizzards all the time! I'm happy to live so close to this location and enjoy all the wonderful treats this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Food is edible.......they screwed up my order so badly that I had to call the manager and complain......forward 6 weeks.... Begrudgingly I go through again and am told by different manager the they would give me 2 free corn dogs......seriously.....I should have known better"}
{"text":"Dairy Queens are plentiful and I've been to hundreds of them, from state to state. Most of them have problems with cleanliness and staff, though occasionally you'll find an awesome one that is run with care. Despite their track record, there are some base expectations that need to be met when you go to a place like this. It's nothing major really. If you can grab some ice cream and not be disgusted or angry by the time you leave, you're usually alright.  This location couldn't even accomplish the basics. Five high school girls were working the place, could not care less about their menial jobs, with no management presence to speak of. While they talked, handled money, and used the phone, a 10 year old that didn't work there was making all the orders. She looked confused and overwhelmed as a line of customers were filing through. The actual employees? Not doing much.  22 minutes to get a blizzard. Twenty-two. I'd never waited so long for ice cream in my life. Wasn't made properly at all, so the taste was sullied as well. That's why I'm taking the time to write a review of a _Dairy Queen_. Boo this location."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow. Maybe 5 people in the restaurant and it took 25 minutes for a number 1"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the store itself is rundown.  In the afternoon the sun beats directly into the windows. Get some pull down shades you say??  Well, they did but all except 1 are broken or torn off.  Booths rock around like a Disney ride.  It just looks like they built it in 1998 and haven't put a penny into it since. And you will stink of fry oil when you walk out...guaranteed."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the  first two times me and my girlfriend ate there it was pretty good and the pricing was decent. On our third time eating there we got horrible service through the drive-thru. They got my girlfriend's order wrong and her burger was ice cold. So we drove back and told them what was wrong, they gave us a attitude for their mistakes. The manager examined the burger and just microwaved the same burger and gave it back to us. We was waiting at the drive-thru window and watch him microwave it.  Not sure if his hands where washed, he didn't have gloves on either."}
{"text":"Every here is so nice and helpful!  Especially Andrew smiling on a Friday night. (Someone get him a real name tag!)"}
{"text":"Dont bother going through this drive thru. I went through a bit before 9 tonight and asked for a banana split with no pineapple and extra chocolate. Molly at the window clarified my order. Even with all of the clarification, when I got home and dug into my treat I found ice cream, banana, loads of pineapple and a tiny drizzle of chocolate. When I called, Molly apologized and said that she would put me on a list for a free split the next time I come in. First, it's not free. I have already paid for it, and I have spent time and gas in order to obtain the faulty product. Second, why would I want to come back, after the prank that somebody pulled tonight?"}
{"text":"Fairly clean. Very busy and was definitely understaffed. The girl with large gauge ear piercings was keeping it moving pretty well though. Our ice cream and corn dog was good and came out quickly."}
{"text":"The old lady that works in the morning was super rude and it took her 20 minutes to make my blizzard. Plus she wouldn't stop talking to the people in front of me. So annoying!"}
{"text":"Employees are very friendly and in the fast food business that really matters!!!! Drive thru cashier was really nice !!!"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is the Best!  It really doesn't matter which location you go to the ice cream is the same.  I love it!  This location however is one in a million in my eyes.  I had a grooms cake mishap with Let Them Eat Cake and the cake designer at this Dairy Queen location made the BEST cake ever!!    She designed the best kickball ice cream cake in less than 48 hours.  Thank you so much for your awesome customer service!!  Everyone at my rehearsal dinner commented on how great the cake looked."}
{"text":"I've been going to this DQ for the last two years. I have always had the best service and the best food at this DQ. the staff is very friendly and the Manager has the habit of asking patrons how their service and food is. The restrooms are clean and the service is top notch, great job! i'll be back week after week."}
{"text":"Cookie dough blizzards & mint Dilly bars, 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"Stop by to get a sundae as walk in there wasn't anyone there until we said hello then the employee came out, the place isn't clean, they use to be better and been here for awhile, but I guess things change. But it's okay if you just want to grab something to eat really quick and leave."}
{"text":"Went here with a camp card for buy one get one free.. used once and they punched a hole in my card and told me the 2nd time i went its not valid. Apparently the cheap owner decided not to give more then 1 use on a multi use coupon. I will make sure to go to another dairy queen in the valley everytime i want dairy queen. They also have the worst customer service saying it is policy and to call the manager. It is a multi use coupon maybe the owner should learn what that means. Also good job wasting your product as i did not purchase the blizzards because i went to another dq that accepted the coupon. Your loss not mine. Hope the owner sees this message as i am also sending it to dq corporate."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this Dairy Queen since they served me a chocolate malt in a leaky cup and it spilled all over my clothes. I went through the drive-through and was a few miles down the road when it started to leak.   When I got home  I called the restaurant to complain, and when I got no response I complained on the Dairy Queen website, and got no response there, either.  I like the Dairy Queen in Mahomet better."}
{"text":"Terrible. Slow service. Placed my order and charged me for a smoothie only to come out 10 minutes later and tell me that the smoothie ingredients were too frozen to make my smoothie and offered me an ice cream cone instead. The dining room was dirty and full of flies. Only went here because we had a gift card and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Drive through line was long so I went inside. Inside it was very slow. Looks like I should have just stayed in the Drive-Thru line because they're not going to get served until everyone in the Drive-Thru line does. They should have somebody taking care (making orders) for counter customers and someone taking care of drive through customers separately."}
{"text":"Staff is unfriendly... Food is over cooked and the ice cream wasn't  fresh and frozen enough."}
{"text":"Horrid stay away.    I don't know why i went to this place after reading the terrible reviews.   Every bad review was spot on.   This place sucks beyond imagination.  Horrid food, and a staff that is totally out to lunch."}
{"text":"Was wifes bday last night, used her buy one get one and manager had everyone tell her HAPPY BIRTHDAY then gave us coupons for 2 more free blizzards!!! WILL BE BCK!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean Dq, the staff are great, They always sell chocolate soft serve witch I love. The cakes are great. I love this Dq!"}
{"text":"It was a stretch to have my husband stop for Dairy Queen.  It took 15 minutes for two sundaes and to top it off, they got the order wrong.  Three girls working behind the counter, very confused and did not know what they were doing.  Won't be going back to here."}
{"text":"Came in this afternoon (6/17). Tiny space; crammed and claustrophobic. Had to overhear the table closest to me's conversation the entire time.   The ice cream was good, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, but the blonde employee with glasses seriously needs some more training. She was about to get started on the customer before me's order, and right before she started making their ice creams, she looks over at me as if she was saying \"what do you want?\" I gave my simple order and she almost rolled her eyes, then put down the cone for the other customer and rung up my order. No \"thank you\", no smile, no customer service skills. She simply gave me my total, and I gave her my card.   After swiping my card, as she was giving me my card back, she knocked over a set of gift cards in the gift card display in front of her. I, being polite, picked up the gift cards that SHE knocked over and put them nicely back in the display. She didn't thank me for doing so or even acknowledge that I picked up her mess.  As I was sitting there eating my ice cream overhearing the obnoxious conversation at the table next to me, I was startled by a LOUD noise. I looked over and saw the same blonde employee (I wish she were wearing a name tag) dumping ice loudly into storage, she made eye contact with me, almost scowling. She gave me the vibe of an entitled millennial who doesn't want to be working. Not sure if she's new or just a bad worker, but it really makes me hesitant to come back."}
{"text":"1-9 opening hours and it was closed at 5. They would not let us in and told us go away. We called them before we went and they said they were open to 9 and they lied."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular Oreo blizzard and a royal oreo blizzard, the guy working repeated our order wrong so I corrected him and I still got the wrong blizzard"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, dropped my ice cream on my table and walked away.   I paid for it but don't act that way towards the customer.  Poor"}
{"text":"The lady hispanic worker was rude. She made my baby boy cry and he didn't want his ice  cream after that. How hard is it to hire some decent workers?"}
{"text":"2 nights in a row we went to this Dairy Queen and after waiting in line for over 20 minutes we're told the ice cream machines are broken. Seriously didn't think we would have the issue the second night since it's an ice cream establishment. Called the third night after seeing another post on FB about this happening to others so we called. Was told actually they are not broken just our machines can't handle the volume.. Not one single time were we offered a coupon or any other item. The girl at the window just laughed and then pretty much same thing on the phone. Where is the manager, what are they doing to keep customers happy??"}
{"text":"Poor service and communication skills. Waited over a damn hour for a cake, which should have really took 40 minutes tops. Needed to wait 30 minutes for it to be done and then 3-5 minutes for it to be written on. Waited over an hour. Not to mention a lady came in about 40 minutes after us, grabbed a cake from the freezer and even ordered food. She had then customize the cake and had it written on as well. She left before us. We should have gotten a free meal or something for that BS. Never coming back to this DQ location EVER again. The owner needs to talk to his employees about customer service. This particular time wasn't even busy too. This DQ also smells and looks so run down. Their rug in front of their counter covers up cracking floor and their walls are so disgusting. Please clean this place up. You would have gotten no stars, if that was at all possible. Hope this helps for anyone that thinks about stepping into this establishment!   I probably should have wrote this out better, but that's how mad I was about this particular DQ."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed, I paid way too much for way too little food. Canes chicken strips are bigger than these, sonic gives me a box full of fries for a fraction of the price. Extremely disappointed, maybe never coming here again."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Blizzards tonight got into car and opened up. They both were less then Blizzard like, more soup like I did not need a spoon and was able to drink from the cup. I will be trying a different DQ next time. One  note they do not turn the Blizzard up side down to show you how good they are done like corporate says they are supposed to do. Instead they have a sign saying they won't do it due to it taking to much time."}
{"text":"Slow service and my peanut buster parfait was not entirely made fresh. They pulled out a partially, pre-made one. They added one more layer of ice cream, hot fudge and peanuts and that was it. One of the blizzards we ordered tasted burned. They remade things but it was a long wait."}
{"text":"The menu items are good but the inside is in much need of renovation.  The owner seems to have saved every dime with cheap paneling and unfinished wooden doors and frames.  Needless to say they haven't held up well over time.  It's very much a let down.  If the blizzards, sundaes and banana splits were no good this place would surely close."}
{"text":"I ordered a blizzard cake here for my Son's 7th birthday party and no less than 3 of our guests found a hair in their slice of the cake. I had ordered the large sheet cake specifically so I would have left overs, which I did, but had to throw it all away after being grossed out about the hair; wasted over $37 on it."}
{"text":"They have messed up my order a couple of times, but other than that everything is up to normal Dairy Queen standards."}
{"text":"This place is different each time. I have gone when its been great and everything worked well. all the order was correct and i didn't have a problem. I have also gone when it was horrible and made the entire family sick except those who didn't eat a particular item. As the other reviewer has mentioned the place does need some remodeling. The ceiling looks like it will collapse. All in all its not the best dairy queen and its not the worst. The dessert items are good but i would recommend staying away from the meat *wink* *wink*"}
{"text":"I have been there twice and both times they have messed up my order. How can you mess up a couple of ice cream cones."}
{"text":"I been to this location several times; i always got excellence serviced. the foods  also always came out hot and fresh. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Tried to take my boys there twice around 9:30 and the crew told them they were closed, also drivethru was closed but hours say 10p.m? Not good."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I went back to Dairy Queen... And now I remember why. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries, and they microwaved a burger for me. Really. Apparently, they have lowered their standards over the years... Or maybe it's just this particular location. They really can't go wrong with getting a blizzard, thank god."}
{"text":"Well...its Dairy Queen. The ice cream is always great. There were four employees at the front counter and not one of them acknowledged us for several minutes. My girlfriend ordered a midnight truffle blizzard and after waiting 5 minutes we are told they don't think they have the midnight truffle ingredients. Don't think? So we order her something else. They are slow and have no real customer service interest. I'll be back because in the end it's still Dairy Queen. Just don't expect anything else besides good ice cream."}
{"text":"Actually deserves no stars. Takes an hour to make one bilzzard and fries. The staff is so rude and careless And they ALWAYS forget something!!!! I hate this DQ."}
{"text":"Sometimes I really wish I could give a negative star rating.. Maybe I just have bad luck? But every time I order through the drive thru, the 16 year old brat with dark hair happens to take my form of payment. She's a prissy little brat if you ask for a to go bag after she's put all her hard work into demonstrating your blizzard by dumping it upside down to ensure its quality.  News flash, kid. Learn some manners and customer service skills.   Needless to say I will be calling her management. I am so tired of being treated poorly by these kids working at every fast food joint on every corner in town.   You can't enjoy quality food/ice cream unless the customer service staff can treat you properly."}
{"text":"The counter person that took our order did not greet us, and her apron was dirty. We noticed a crate on the floor that had ice cream filler in it, the counter lady kicked it aside with her foot as she walked pass.  Next a gentlemen who has facial hair handed us our order, of course he did not have a facial net covering his beard.  If I could rate as a zero star I would. I bought a local coupon, that's the only reason that we ordered. I should've walked out ."}
{"text":"Consistently gyp you of toppings, so much so that I pay for extra toppings just to get the original amount I should be receiving. If you pay for extra toppings, you should be getting extra toppings right?"}
{"text":"This DQ is always clean and friendly.  We went to the drive through the other day, and they forgot a cone, so I went inside to get the forgotten cone.  I wasn't upset, it happens and I just showed my receipt and asked for the cone.  The employee went straight to the manager, who sent the drive through guy over with a card for a free Blizzard and an apology!  I really didn't need all that, just the cone would have been fine, but it was such a grand gesture in this day and age!  I was SO impressed with their customer service.  That is how things should be done!  Kudos!!"}
{"text":"Have been a couple times. Figured it would get better over time since it opened recently. It's only gotten worse. Orders are wrong and last night my blizzard tasted of burned plastic. I will not go back!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find a Dairy Queen close to home. But, that was short lived. I ordered a blizzard and it was below the rim and very short on additives. When I asked about it, i was told \"it's within Dairy Queen guidelines\". I'm not a Dairy Queen expert, but this was sub-par to the other Dairy Queens I've visited. :("}
{"text":"Ecasketch bad service. Wrong order. Poor chris ..super hereo sosa to rescue! Dipped chocalate cone check. Lol!"}
{"text":"THIS DQ is over-the -top, with their pricing. I will never return to this location.  Hey, if you're craving a soft serve ..... go to the McDonalds, accross the street. McD is a bargain, compared to this DQ."}
{"text":"This is a clean and efficient DQ. You can't say that about them all... We love this DQ, they are always kind, courteous, friendly & efficient... Never a complaint here. The staff seem to all be interested in doing a great job. Food is always hot and or cold where applicable... They all seem genuine in wanting to work here..."}
{"text":"Thurs 3/10 I had left my PCP on Bethany Home Road and 21st Ave and was headed to my insurance provider to pick up meds and have X-rays taken.  I just exited I17 on Dunlap and my car was over heating so I pulled in to the DQ there thinking I would let the car cool off and continue on my way to 59th and Eugie Ave.  At first I just went in to let the car cool down and the manager Frank Faria came up to me and asked if I had a problem.  I told him the situation and unbelievably he offered to not only take a look at my car but offered to take me to my insurance provider to make sure I got there and had my X-rays and meds.  Not only did he take me there he stayed there with me through the entire ordeal and returned me to my car.  Needless to say, the odds on this happening are one in a million.  BTW, the cheese burger, fries and Strawberry Cheesecake shake were delicious.  Talk about wonderful service and a manger that has a heart of gold.  I would definitely recommend this DQ to everyone I know and I have also made it a point to tell everyone I know about the DQ manger  Frank Faria with a heart of gold.  The people in this place are also helpful, friendly and very professional.  Thank you Frank and helpers.  I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"The kids were excited that we were getting a Dairy Queen so close by, so I decided to stop in with them for lunch. I quickly found out that lunch wouldn't be possible because, other than ice cream, they only have hot dogs, chips and I think maybe wraps? No burgers, sandwiches, chicken tenders, fries, etc. Blah. The place is as big as any other Dairy Queen, so I have no idea why they would limit their sales like that when there's definitely space to accommodate the necessary equipment. I took two stars away for the crappy menu, but the employees were friendly/fast and my kids liked the ice cream so they got two stars for that. The happy hour deals are pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"I was CRAVING a triple Thick Chocolate Shake yesterday evening. My search began at McD's where a McCafe Shake left me wanting. What is up with this watered, or shall I say milked down version with whipped cream and a cherry... Next stop- DQ where Chanel took care of my Triple Thick Chocolate Obsession with some DQ Mastery I tell ya! Straight Up Ice-Cream, no milk and PLEASE hold the effin whipped cream and cherry, wtf? Thank-You Chanel! Uh, I hope you are there now cuz I just activated the Obsession Again!!! DQ, ready or not, here I come!"}
{"text":"This place provided the worst service I've had in a long time. My three-year-old son and I arrived at approximately 11:15 on a Monday morning and couldn't get in because the door was locked, even though the \"open\" sign was lit. When someone finally opened the door for us and another customer, they were completely unprepared for business. We were there for an ice cream cake, of which they had ZERO prepared, so we had to wait several minutes for them to locate and decorate one. The gentleman who had entered with us simply wanted an order of French fries and had to wait at least ten minutes for them. While we were waiting, another guy walked in and wanted a blizzard, but they had to dig out the ingredients for it from some side freezer because they just were not prepared. To top it off, they were unfriendly to my kid because he started getting restless after being required to stand around for fifteen minutes. Two stars because the cake turned out nice. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! If I could give zero stars I would. 5 people working & what a cluster. Overcharged by $10 for 6 blizzards, had to repeat the order to the workers approximately 8 times throughout the course of the time they were making them. Owner was on site and did nothing to correct all the errors. After 25+ minutes we finally left and STILL did not have the blizzards we ordered. The Blizzards we did leave with were completely melted due to all the drama. In the meantime of all this, the man who placed his order behind ours was told \"we just ran out of turkey for your turkey BLT - can we put chicken instead?\" To which the man just shook his head & laughed. Several parties walked in & saw the mess we were enduring & promptly left.   Look I can forgive a few errors but this was beyond forgiving, especially with the owner on site, who did not even apologize or even attempt to make things right. Not OK!!!"}
{"text":"As someone that grew-up with a weekly trip to our only fast-food joint in my little town, Dairy Queen/Brazier Burger,  this location brings back many of those memories. For starters, this is one of the few Dairy Queen locations in Toronto that actually serves hamburgers! That's why I go here. I thought the service was fine, and IMHO, clean. I eat here about once a month, and more frequently during the summer months. Great view of the Don Vally  from the patio seating.   I'm sure it's fine for the ice cream, but I come here for the burgers."}
{"text":"Busy little dq. Always a fun hangout with friends. Great ice-cream too !!!"}
{"text":"I visited Dairy Queen off of 27th Avenue and Carefree Hwy and ordered a \"Brownie Sundae\" I also ordered a \"Peanut Buster\" parfait at the drive thru.  Once at home, I opened the bag and there was only vanilla ice cream with brownies on top. I returned to the DQ and indicated that my order is incorrect, and I explained what I received and they said well this is what you ordered.  I stated it should have hot fudge.  The young person so called \"apologized\" then replied, \"Well you have to be specific when ordering as we have a peanut sundaes, marshmallow, and so on.  I then said, \"I guess I will know for next time\".     Now I wonder if I ordered their promotional \"Oreo Brownie Earthquake Sundae\" are you telling me that it will only have Oreo cookies and brownies on the sundae?  When people are trained proper customer service you do not make the customer be wrong and pretend you are doing them a favor.  That is one way to not have a returning customer."}
{"text":"Ordered One of my favorite Oreo cookie blizzard. Delicious and relaxing. But while writing this review I found a special surprise in the middle, a big empty void (hole) umm should be some more ice cream in this yeah?? Minus one store for you!!!"}
{"text":"The place appears clean and I didn't witness anything gross.  My order was taken quickly, we were the only people there. My only issue was the blizzard was messy as in messy dripping all over the cup which brings me to the fact that it's a blizzard. Everywhere I've ever been they've tipped the cup upside down to show how thick it is. If they had the entire contents would have plopped out, since it was melty.  It still tasted like banana split. My little girl said they should have 4 stars because she loved her chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!  Walked at 7:58 into a dining room full of people and people at the counter and were turned away because they say they close at 8. Their website says they are open until 8:30!!!!  Wont be visiting this DQ again if they don't want my business. If I could give zero stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is what you expect at a Dairy Queen, but the smell inside this location is the worst raw sewage type of stench I have ever smelled, except for a gas station restroom at a truck stop. It's bad. As soon as you walk in the restaurant, you are hit with a TERRIBLE ODOR. Employees told us it's been a problem for some time because of a pipe break or something. Wow, this can't be healthy for anyone to inhale! Choose a different location until they address this problem or be prepared to vomit."}
{"text":"Overall pleased with the experience.  Customer service not great but the employees were not rude. Chocolate ice cream tasted a little funky tonight. Can't place it, but seemed almost tangy. Hope it was a fluke. Been there several times before and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible decision to come here tonight. I ordered a medium oreo mint blizzard. I got a medium regular Oreo blizzard so we went inside and told them it was wrong, and the supposed manager proceeded to argue with us telling us that it isn't wrong, that you could clearly see the green mint (my blizzard was white as snow) and that they just didn't put enough. ??? So then she goes to \"remake\" my blizzard, putting green mint flavor on the top of the blizzard and no where else. So not only did we wait for the same exact f**king thing, but she gave us a small. Remember how i said I ordered a medium? We asked why she gave us a smaller size and she has the nerve to validate that and says, \"that's all I'm giving you\" so if you want an ice cream joint that charges you for a larger, incorrect order and treats you terribly for being upset about this, DQ is the place!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to. The toppings are always significantly less than other locations, the employees don't seem to know what's going on, seeming disinterested or incapable . Dealing with this location is always frustrating from payment issues to not being able to provide menu items (ie: toppings, chili cheese dog, hamburger).  They even refused to make a cake even though I gave them the appropriate days notice. They said they couldn't, however I could try another DQ. So I asked to speak to the manager because it didn't make sense that their store policy would be different than another's. When the well dressed manager came out to speak to me she was even less helpful than the confused employee.  She couldn't even provide me with the number of another location to save me the drive.  Overall, incredibly disappointing.  It's sad because as a family we love their products, and this location is very convenient for us, unfortunately it's always a hassle and makes us feel unvalued as a customer."}
{"text":"I must say they took care of me there .  There about to close and there made my ice cream so fast and hook it up on the price because they F up lol so I got 2 free ice cream and I must say that's winning for me ."}
{"text":"This location has very fast service and a quiet environment. Recommended."}
{"text":"Yeah, I have this DQ 4 stars...don't judge me.   Sometimes you just need that white artificial softserve and cake cone, or Blizzard.  Sometimes you *don't want* all-natural, super premium ice cream costing a hoity-toity $8.  Sometimes, you just want to be taken back to childhood, when the Dilly bar was the most important thing you look forward to all week.   This DQ is clean and bright, and the employees do their job well.  DQ has certainly evolved since my day...not featuring a mini Blizzard which is exactly what I needed.  (Since I could never finish even the smallest size.)   Get your sprinkles on."}
{"text":"I came in to take advantage of my Bogo blizzard coupon. When I entered, there was no one in the front, so I peeked around saw someone just sitting down in the back. I said \"Excuse me\" and she came to the front and told me to wait a second because she doesn't speak English. WTF? I came to get a snack before work, and this simple trip ended up taking way too much time. I'm pretty sure this is a franchised DQ, and I won't be coming back to this one. Having one employee and a supervisor that cannot communicate with customers is ridiculous. They will not get any more of my money."}
{"text":"Too much sauce on the mushroom burger, i guess its good for the ones that likes lotsa sauce but otherwise was tasty. The fries was good, it comes with a yummy frysauce. The salted caramel ice coffee tasted like 90% sugar"}
{"text":"I grew up on DQ ice cream and I am sad to say that the quality of the ice cream has gotten worse over the last few years. The ice cream used to be so creamy and had excellent taste! Now it seems like DQ has lowered their standards and have begun to use low quality ingredients, which has caused the product to taste like ice milk. I would have went to McDonald's if I wanted low quality. DQ please bring back the better tasting ice cream, Please!!!!"}
{"text":"Trust me after coming in here once. Will not come in here again. The cashier who took our order was to say the least friendly. No name badge cause I'm sure he's gotten more than one complaint by his negative attitude. He not once greeted us and or made any suggestions. We ordered and I think he was more interested in using the mouse to control the screen on the register. He blatantly states $8.16. I hand him $9.00 and he hands me the receipt and $.84 cents back. Not once did he say thank you or it'll be right out. He just stood there. I hope this review is read so that no one has to be treated the way we were and what's a shame is that we live 5 blocks from this DQ but now will travel a few miles to go to Coldstone Creamery to satisfy my craving. A hello even a smile goes along way and the owners and or managers of this establishment need to hire people who care and not to just fill a position."}
{"text":"I ordered cheese curds, afterwards they informed me they ran out and asked if I would like something else. I asked for the popcorn shrimp totally ready to pay the difference but the guy said it's ok and gave me fries on top of that! Way to make a customer happy!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen location is headed in the right direction.  I had an issue with some store personnel and Jason was fast to resolve.  He is making a positive impact and this crew shows improvement.  I will eat here again since the store is dedicated to quality and customer service."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Dairy Queens I have ever been to. As soon as I walked in the front doors I felt this welcoming and joyful aura. The aroma of waffle cones being made and to see this handsome young boy with long curly hair had the friendliest smile and asked me how my day was going. I'm very pleased with the staff and the products!!!"}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen treats (especially the Peanut Buster Parfait and Blizzards), but holy smokes has it ever gotten expensive!  I like their shrimp and onion rings, but am not a big fan of their other food (especially their fries).  Great place for an occasional treat!"}
{"text":"I was in this store Thursday afternoon with my son. I'm not one to ever write reviews, but this one kid (I think his name was Andrew) was really cool with my 7 year old son. He noticed his little league shirt on and started talking baseball with him for a while. He really made my son feel great."}
{"text":"Very upset at this location. I work across the street and went on my lunch break. I spent 45 minutes in the drive thru and they really didn't even have a line. once I finally got to the window, I paid, then sat for 15 minutes. I actually watched them put my food together 3 minutes after I arrived at the window. The girl at the window disappeared , and I finally found her dancing in the back of the store. There must have been at least 10 crew members inside the kitchen and it took 5 minutes just to wave someone down. When I finally got someone to speak to me I told them the situation and all I got was an attitude. Not even a sorry for the wait. Then practically got my food thrown at me. When I asked the girls name that was supposed to be at the window the guy shut the window. And said bye. it's ridiculous how rude these kids were. I've been in fast food, I know it sucks but they should have at least some sort of customer service or shit.. Common sense.!!!!"}
{"text":"Once again, disappointed with this location. I only come back here because my kids like the blizzards but everything I ever order either takes 20 minutes to make or it's made wrong...tonight I asked for chocolate ice cream, they bring me vanilla and when I send it back stating I ordered chocolate, the girl comes back 5 minutes later saying they are out of chocolate...Dairy Queen has two flavors, how the hell do you run out of one of them? The drive thru wait is always 20+ minutes whether there is 1 car or 10...super poor management here, if they are ever even here. Can't recall ever seeing one. Ok, rant is over, I'd rather spend 3 times the money down the street at Gelatology..."}
{"text":"Kids love it here. Always a good experience. We usually have a good size order and they always get it right. Never a long wait time. We will defiantly keep coming in for our treats !!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Gilbert DQ tonight for an after dinner ice cream treat w/ my husband and son.  We all wanted a peanut buster parfait.  My hubbie and son both like peanut butter so they decided to try the Peanut Butter Blast.   It looked just like the peanut buster parfait but w/ PB added and the price was the same so we ordered two of those and one p-buster for me.  Imagine our surprise when the Peanut Butter Blast sundaes showed up as half the size of my p-buster parfait.  We really felt ripped off by the deceptive picture shown on the menu and won't be going back ever again.  DQ....you've made my list of companies I won't visit ever again.  Sonic has a better deal and they won't rip me off."}
{"text":"I always get pretty good service here but once I changed my mind about going in and I left- the cashier flipped out and looked at us crazily while making all these unnecessary hand motions"}
{"text":"I just want to thank the manager of this Dairy Queen.  She has gone out of her way to help make the best blizzards a person can make for my husband.  Always greets everyone in a cheerful manner and makes me feel right at home.  I come in every other day or so to get two large butter finger blizzards and two large chocolate cookie dough blizzards.  I take them home and split them into smaller cups and freeze them. This is the only thing that appeals to my husband and is easy enough to swallow.  He has end stage colon cancer and each morning looks forward to that first cool smooth taste of blizzard.  Along with a few bottles of ensure  each day that give him protein and vitamins, the blizzards also offer some tasty nutrition. So when the doctors say \"give him anything he wants to eat or drink\" my car drives itself to Dairy Queen.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"Tall kid with black hair and Tats on his arm very very rude. Not one smile I had to ask for my receipt and he threw it at me."}
{"text":"Poor service extremely slow and they will serve others before you I will never come here again.  Will definitely keep going to ColdStone."}
{"text":"Fucking awful service they were extremely rude it too us about 40 mins to get our smoothies it smelt terrible in there the whole place was just filthy from tables to where u order the whole back area where they prepare the food was just gross I don't even want to get my food there ice cream was on the floor everywhere cups cones it's like they don't clean up we had to keep asking at one point they forgot our order take my advice and never come here u will regret it the lines were so fucking long it's like they were all in back hanging out they were getting everyone's order wrong just please don't come here they need to be evaluated shut down they need new management and everything"}
{"text":"Not the fastest service, but the staff was friendly and my food is piping hot. I also feel like I'm short a couple fries in my chicken strip basket..."}
{"text":"Who can resist the taste from childhood which sometimes calls to you at 9pm on a random week night?   I like it simple: a chocolate or caramel dipped cone.  Yup, That's it.  Nothing fancy.  And how can you resist like 1 of the last horsey rides for 25 cents left on earth?  (Yes, it play High-Ho-Silver)  (I'm not sure who gets more joy, me or the child I put on it - or maybe i sorta try to sneak on it)"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday afternoon for a quick sweet treat, there were two employees and a crazy line. The employees did not really seem to have any system in place for helping guests and it took forever! Ice cream was as expected from Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever encountered in a fast food restaurant setting. I frequent Dairy Queen locations probably twice or three times a month and get the same thing every time. They gave me the wrong item in the drive thru and then when I asked for the correct item and gave the other one back, they were making me pay for a completely new item even though they messed it up. They then offered to only make me pay 1/2 of the item, which I asked why because it was not my fault they gave me the wrong order. Then, when I requested to call customer service and ask his name he tells me \"well now you have to pay full price of the item since you wanna call customer service now\". Not even giving me the wrong item, or the right item and already ran my credit card for $4.00, they refused to give me the right item or my money back for something they messed up! So they basically just stole $4.00 from me and wanted me to pay for a completely new one! Not to mention how rude they were to me about the situation. When all they had to do was give me what I asked for. I don't think I will be back at this location until they get an attitude adjustment and learn to make a customer's order correct and learn customer service. Completely awful. When I asked the guy his name he told me \"Mike\" which I'm sure was a lie.. He was indian and had no sense of customer service."}
{"text":"I went to this Dairy Queen a couple weeks ago and the employee working at the drive through window noticed I had dogs in the back seat of  the car so he made them each a doggie sundae with vanilla soft serve and two dog biscuits. What a nice gesture! I left very impressed with their customer service. I recommend this place!."}
{"text":"There was trash EVERYWHERE There were 6 people standing around in the back and not working and the cashier asked a girl standing around to make y desert and se said \"well are you helping anyone\" and then the cashier had to make my desert! DONT GET ICE CREAM HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a mini strawberry cheese quake blizzard and only got two peices of cheesecake in it. I'm used to seeing strawberry in it and more cheesecake. I ended up throwing it away. They also served people who ordered after me first. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"dirty behind the counter!  yuk.  instead of sitting in the DQ, we preferred sitting out back by the garbage dump.  But, hey, on the plus side, we found a good spot to drop off spare recycles."}
{"text":"Ice cream is one of the greatest food items in the world, and brings joy to so many. The staff at this location have figured out how to take the fun and joy out of ice cream, ruining it for everyone.   If I could rate this location less than one star, I would."}
{"text":"I just left the Dairy Queen on Warm Springs in Henderson and lo and behold once again they messed up my order when you order something you should get it how hard is your job people oh I forgot the kid at the window looks like he's so young he's going through puberty I just got through reading reviews for the past few years complaints are in abundance about behavior from this Dairy Queen why would an owner or manager not let the high school kids use the restroom that is ridiculous and discrimination also the reviews said the exact thing I always get your order in to the drive thru and totally get cut off speaking the owner needs to get a clue and stop hiring kids I know they work cheap but so do retired people get a clue I also called they're very angry just now and guess what an answering machine gee I wonder why I will be back in tomorrow for my money back and I just hope I don't go off on somebody that's how mad I am it's ridiculous it's a simple job and now since I'm itching all over I won't sleep and I need to call in sick tomorrow maybe I should sue these assholes"}
{"text":"I normally love Dairy Queen but these last 2 time that I've gone there's been long hairs in are bananas split including today I'm not sure If we want to come back."}
{"text":"I had ordered a blizzard (banana cream pie) and every single time I've went there it always sucks. My blizzard is basically melted by the time they hand it to me. They are meant to be thick wiped?! Am I right?? Well obviously that's not the case here. Very disappointed :/"}
{"text":"Went the first time and they gave me the wrong order.. No chocolate EVER.. Moved down here almost a year ago and after the South Durango store closed I went to this store.. And they still get orders wrong and again... NO CHOCOLATE STILL.. Travel the extra time to a better DQ cause you won't get soft served chocolate.."}
{"text":"We ordered a medium cone and a small dipped cone and 2 other items. They accidentally gave us a small cone instead of medium. I complained before they completed order. They remade a medium cone but because they were mad over this they gave me dipped cone that was much smaller than the kid size  about 1/2 inches tall and snickered while doing it. This was so unprofessional. I have frequently gone to Dairy Queen and have never had this type of customer service."}
{"text":"I clean a house in the area once or twice a month and always take my lunch break here. The $5 dollar lunch is a great deal! Usually I get tons of fry's and 3 chicken tenders. This time the chicken was tiny and I got a child sized handful of COLD AND STALE fry's. Needless to say that prompted me to review the whole place.  Every time I come here they can't understand me through the intercom. Than they get fed up with ME! And start to get rude. I don't know if they know it's not my problem OR MAYBE they think I'm being annoying, so they spit in my stuff. Either way, I don't appreciate the attitude. $5 lunch deals aren't even worth it!"}
{"text":"Went threw the drive thru at this location and had the worst experience ever, I sat at the window for at least 15min. after I place my order    then they closed the window in my face \"VERY RUDE\" so I pulled off and called the manger and he was rude also telling me a story about the car behind me had a $30 order and he short staff and I don't know anything about being short staff. Excuse me !!!!! U talking to a manger now and I know how to treat my customers when I'm short staff. Customers come first, u apologize for there wait and also let them know that u know there waiting and there order will be up shortly. Now I had to call corporation after this so called manger rudely hung up on me. Corporation was nice when I talk to them but I want stop there next will be the better business bureau. This store will learn one way or another how to treat customers the right way when I get done."}
{"text":"Never again.  $10 + for 2 medium sundaes.  They charge extra for nuts and whipped cream.  McDonald's sundaes are better.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my boyfriend for some ice cream. He got a banana split and I got a Georgia mud fudge blizzard.  Dairy Queen is consistent and they were both what you would expect. Very good ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Great ice cream.  Always a good alternative to the restaurant across the parking lot.  DQ rocks..."}
{"text":"I like this Dairy Queen, ususally we come here to get some after sushi dessert.  It's really clean (in comparsion to other Dairy Queens), the Blizzards are made perfectly awesome and there's a lot of seating!"}
{"text":"I remember visiting this DQ 40 years ago as a child and its basically the same.  I love the vanilla cones with cherry dip.  Here's to another 40 years of success for this location."}
{"text":"Love DQ, especially when it's a hop, skip and a jump from my front door. Always busy, but never a super long wait. Have had my order messed up a few times, but it is always fixed in a friendly and timely fashion. It's a great family treat on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times, service is the same each time. Bad. End of the day I know it's just ice cream and we go there once every couple months but the staff seems like characters out of a movie who hate their job. Their attitude clearly seems like we are bothering them and we shouldn't have gone somewhere else. I also think it's a reflection of the manager and the owner. This location on bell today I think had the heat on, it was easily 90 degrees in there and the employee gave us the ice cream as if we would sit there and sweat while we ate it. We opted to take it home, but you just get the feeling that the owner of this franchise doesn't care, it's dirty sort of run down and the staff is lazy. I also recall a time I was here at the drive thru and I forgot my glasses so it was rather tough reading the menu, so it took a little longer to order than the kid working wanted, there was no one in front of me and the order was completely incorrect. Some things were right but the specific things I asked for were ignored intentionally. He did however remember to tip the stupid blizzard upside down, which I can't believe Dairy Queen advertises. It's ice cream and you just mixed it up, who cares if it doesn't fall out. I feel bad that the staff has to do this dumb gimmick, but it's the closest DQ to my house and I don't go a lot, so dealing with a dumpy store with employees that are pissed they have to work is bearable since I don't go often"}
{"text":"This is the first DQ i can remember going to. Although the area is a little rough, the location is clean. The workers are friendly and have decent customer service. Ordered two or 3times from this location and haven't been dissatisfied yet!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight at 9:35 PM one car in front of me in the drive thru, Left at 10:02 and they got our order wrong. Decent food but very poor service.."}
{"text":"Okay So I ate here this afternoon with my husband and first off he was really upset about how the deluxe burger he got had no lettuce or onion just an old patty and pickles! When we ordered our fries we asked for it to be well done and no sir it was still soggy when we got them!Then they told me there were no tortillas for the order I wanted and at first did not want to substitute anything on the menu for that! Then the bathroom there for women are out of order(they just opened up!) my man told me they did not even mop the floors with clean water and that they didn't even have fishnets or gloves on making the food.i wasn't sure if they washed their hands!ugh I noticed that too and that they don't give a fuck about customer service just want their weekly or biweekly check..will I come back and eat here or order here?.. Oh hell no..not after my experience today."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised by the 1.5 Star this location has. My mom and I stopped by tonight at this location. I will never make that mistake again. I order a Banana Split it was the smallest Banana Split I had ever seen. It almost got lost in the dish they serviced it in. When they brought it to the table I asked them if this was a child's size, they just looked at me. A man walked by and said \"yikes\" I'm never ordering that. My mom's Med-size Hot Fudge Sundae was a normal size but we were charged for the whipped cream 0.35, Cherry 0.10, Nuts 70 cents because she wanted 1/2 peanuts and 1/2 pecans. When did Sundae's stop coming with whipped cream, cherry and nuts? I just looked at my receipt and I can also take an on-line survey. My receipt shows - Check# 601, Check# 377601, time: 7:41pm."}
{"text":"The staff are incompetent, and have no common sense. Go to The Boulder City location or another this Store is the worst. Unreal 1 Star on a good day."}
{"text":"Now I'm a fan or Dairy Queen, don't get me wrong. I would slam out a DQ vanilla cone dipped in chocolate AND sprinkles everyday if I could.  But the staff at this particular location seem to be unqualified. You are probably wondering, how could they be unqualified? It's Dairy Queen? Guess again! Every time I go to this location they have given me the wrong amount of change or none at all. That doesn't bother me, it's the quality of the ice cream. I'm not asking for a Marble Slab masterpiece but I would like my ice cream to maybe resemble.... ice cream?  My horrific experience happened when I ordered a banana split; instead of a simple banana split I received some pig slop. It was all mush and no banana.  But the worst is that every single time I order a blizzard they do the whole fruit on the top nothing on the bottom thing(instead of mixing it up, hence the name \"blizzard\"). I'm still a slave to DQ but won't be returning to this location for a while.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Their food is good. I came here for a flame flower burger and we sat in the drive thru for TWENTY MINUTES with 6 other cars. What a joke! Do your work and stop leaving people waiting for so damn long."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst service. Very unprofessional.  sent an order for the birthday cake online on Monday. Have not heard back. Called and left a message on Tuesday-never got a call or email back. Finally on Wednesday called again and got someone on a phone, some young lady who said she will \"call me if anything\". I reiterated that it is my son's 10th birthday, and it is important that the cake is done. What does it mean \"she will call me if anything??\"  The woman called me on Friday to finalize some details on the cake.  Saturday 11:30 AM, few hours before I had to pick up the cake for tomorrow's birthday party she calls and tells me they cannot print the picture the printer is not working.  I understand issues came up. What did you do to fix it? NOTHING! Instead, she 1. does not apologize once. 2. tells me I have to find another printer, I have to print the picture and bring it to them. I said I am willing to find another printer and arrange, but they will pay for it and will go and pick it up-thats' how customer service should be when you screw up the order at the last moment. For that she said she wont do it she has not time. Seriously, I am surprised how these places stay in business??"}
{"text":"There is an older woman that works days that has been there for years. She is not pleasant. She says the screwiest things. Our order was 3 items. One of the items was a large cone with half the ice cream. I explained to her several times, I want the large cone with half of the ice cream you normally make it with. Her response was: we can not do that. I told her that is what I want  and I will pay for a large cone. The second thing she said: why don't you just order a small cone. REALLY!!! It's really none of her business. Just fill the order. Hopefully, she is not the owner or a relative and someone will talk to her."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the staff was nice but they were out of whip cream! Really there is a grocery store across the street! The owner is a  really a** , he is rude and I believe that's where the issue start with this place. We ordered a waffle cone and with chocolate on it the chocolate was running all over it so they just made it and handed it over."}
{"text":"This location hurts my brain. It is close to home so when we want an ice cream treat we sometimes come here.  And then we remember why we said we won't come back to this location.  The drive thru headsets never work well so you have to repeat your order about 16 times or drive up to the front to clarify. When you do get the order, they are sloppily put together and they don't provide napkins. Ever. We've opted to go into the store to place our order but the service isnt much better (although you only have to say your order once and can take as many napkins as your hands can hold).  Not the best location at all...you are much better off going a little east to Deerfoot Meadows."}
{"text":"We have been in many times to this location at different times of the days and on different days. Every single time the Blizzards are watery. One time for the heck of it we asked how come they don't turn it upside down? If they did, it would be thicker and taste better. We got our first response of \"when going through the drive-through you must request for them not to put it in a bag and then they will honor the Blizzard being free next time.\" So the next time we go in and the response was they don't flip over at this location. I asked if it was a Franchise location and they responded with \"yeah.\" Another watery, runny blizzard with rushes service. This last time we saw they had a cotton candy blizzard and my daughter who is 7 wanted to try it. Apparently,we took too long to decide because the lady asked if we we were ready to order multiple times and hadn't even been there, but two minutes. Calm down. So when we get to the window we don't get greeted instead we get a bitchy look from a teenager that looks like she doesn't want to be there. I get handed a blizzard with a bag that says \"upside down or it's free\" as well as just ordering from a sign that says \"it's upside down or its free next time.\" Open the bag to find runny blizzards with their lids squeezed on and runny ice cream down the sides. Really? It's hot. I do not want to drink my damn blizzard that we paid $5 for. You can go down the street to a real ice cream shop, get amazing service and pay the same price for wonderful ice cream. I don't know WHY I gave this place another try. So my husband gets out and goes in to be greeted by the same rude teenager who points to a sign & says because of their drive-through times they do not have to honor the upside down blizzard. It's always a different story, but it's always the same crappy teenagers with poor attitudes, and it's always runny ass ice cream. Doesn't matter if you get the peanut buster parfait or the blizzard or the brownie ice cream, it all just doesn't taste like other dairy queens we have been too. My husband calls later cause our ice cream was melted and the phone is answered by the same rude worker who says she's the manager (yeah right) & says her general manager is in the back, then says he won't be in until 4pm the next day. When I ask for a number she says \"what I'm sorry I can't hear you you're breaking up\" literally pretended like she couldn't hear me. Unbelievable. Whoever runs this location needs to get it together. I will be writing corporate because I know franchise does NOT make their own rules they must follow corporate policy. The point isn't a free blizzard. The point is: when I got into a ice cream shop on a hot ass day I DO NOT want to drink my ice cream. THAT IS WHY IT NEEDS TO BE SERVED UPSIDE DOWN. It proves the ice cream is thick and cold."}
{"text":"Great, fast service and delicious ice cream! I came in the morning and employees were happy. The music was great and loved my experience! Always satisfied when I go to this Dq."}
{"text":"Kids meal drink cup is the size of the gravy cups. they didn't include a toy  the fries were half raw & hard.  only thing they got right was the chicken strips. I'm from Texas so I asked the girl taking my drive Thur order if they had a taco salad she had NO ideal what I was talking about so when I pulled up to the window the manager came to window to ask my what DQ u could get a taco salad at? So sad do u all not realize DQ started off in Texas not Ohio anywhere in the south u can get a DQ taco salad or tacos which both are great in the south. I suggest u all read up on the company u work for. So disappointing won't go back to here I feel like they made fun of us or thought I was lying or crazy. Sad service"}
{"text":"I usually don't go to Dairy Queen often but when we do it's only because I'm really craving it. After ordering the chicken strip basket we had asked for gravy as the dip. We got our food and headed home, the basket was good but the gravy straight up tasted like sink water. DONT get the gravy! Had to make my own freakin gravy."}
{"text":"Paid $30 for a cookie dough ice cream cake for boyfriend's birthday. Ordered it online which was awesome and convenient. I specified that I need it to say Happy Birthday etc etc but upon picking it up it looked like a standard cake, beige, drab, ugly and boring. No writing, no happy birthday, no nothing, zero color.  Thankfully I had an assortment of sprinkles at home and FIXED IT but that'll be the last time I order a birthday cake from them. Had their birthday cakes years ago and they were awesome! Maybe it's just this location. (?) I just totally was not happy and for that price you'd think they make it at least look good."}
{"text":"The worst experience. Set in drive thru for 35 minutes, only 6 cars in front of us.Then after waiting that long, we get 3 chicken fingers instead of 4, and drink that was half full, gray that we asked for extra cup, got just one cup instead that wasnt even half full. Called the store, rang and rang and nobody answered. Very poor experience for my first time there and we live right next door. Will not be recommeding this location. Crew apparently dont check the orders, nor does management no how to answer the phone."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience after I was handed over a sad, half-melted plop of ice cream inside a meduim cone. I brought it to the cashier's attention that the serving was rather small, but she only asked her co-worker to look at the bottom of the cone to which he said \"The cone is meduim.\" They said nothing else, shut the window and walked away. I didn't ask the obvious if the actual cone was a size medium, I was inquiring about the abnormally small amount of ice cream in the cone. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is the closest location for us, so we make a few trips a month to get ice cream. This location is very small, and can get crowded pretty quick during the summer months, but service is usually pretty quick. Staff is nice and friendly. I love the taste of their ice cream (blizzards to be exact), but it is not cheap.  We usually wait until we get a coupon before we go. If we didn't use coupons (be part of the email club), we wouldn't go as frequent and I wouldn't be giving it four stars."}
{"text":"Wow I am shocked that this DQ has such bad reviews!  Every single time I've been to this location the kids that work there have been great! I mean not just nice but above and beyond.  Also, I don't know why or how but they have better ice cream than the one up on Bell Rd."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen!!  We go through the drive thru mainly at this location.   The soft serve is fabulous, I love it dipped in chocolate!  The blizzards always have a lot of toppings- no skimping at this location.  The hunny and I like the Reese peanut butter cup blizzard or the Oreo blizzard.  One time we accidentally got the wrong order and tried the fudge brownie cheesecake blizzard with extra fudge on the side and we thought it was a little too rich.  We still ate the whole thing, as usual of course!"}
{"text":"This place has made me hate Dairy Queen. The customer service is terrible. Go somewhere else, at least a different Dairy Queen. I got food poisoning when I went here one time also. And my chicken tenders were cold and disgusting."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening I went thru the Drive Up window and experienced the most rude behavior from a female employee...I will not frequent that place ever again"}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again! And let me preface this by saying, I'm a person that NEVER complains at establishments because I'm afraid they will spit in my food. But this was unacceptable. Over the years when I've ordered blizzards, they come with the ice cream above the cup and then turned over to show it's thick. So I'm aware how it should be served. On 12/9/17 @ 8:06pm I ordered two small blizzards, when I got to the window the girl asked if I wanted lids on them. I said yes. The first lid went on fine. The second she had trouble with, she walked out of my sight, when she came back she had scraped off the top part of the blizzard down below the cup line. I stated that now a lot of it's gone. She said oh well that happens when you put a lid on it. I indicated that was unacceptable and she said it's store policy NOT to remake it because of the lid. I asked if I can pay to have another remade, she said NO and turned her back towards me. I called her the B word. Which was wrong, but I was upset at this point. I drove around front and all the teenagers working in there started saying \"here she comes\" and \"are you allright?\" to the girl at the window. She said \"I'm fine\" in a loud voice and laughed. I stood there for about a minute before I asked to be acknowledged. A young man came up to me and I explained that I will pay to have this remade because most of it was gone (not my blizzard taking it to a sick friend). He handed the blizzard to a guy in back. I stood there and they all were snickering and looking at me. He came back and handed me a blizzard made PURPOSELY below the cup line just to be a jerk. Probably was the same blizzard. And who knows what they did to it back there. He started to give me some b.s. story and I said I didn't want to hear it and left. I get that it's only about 1/2 an inch of ice cream but they're not cheap and apparently this location's franchise owner does not care about return business."}
{"text":"When someone goes above and beyond in giving amazing customer service, it really stands out. My 6 year old son had his heart set on having the cotton candy blizzard ice cream cake for his upcoming birthday party, so I placed the order online, only to get a call that the cotton candy was a seasonal item and they were all out. In calling surrounding stores, they were out as well. The manager Robert took it upon himself to call around until he found a store that still had some of the cotton candy so that my son could have the birthday cake he really wanted. Thank you Robert for going above and beyond the call of duty - you rock!"}
{"text":"There blizzards are great!!! I love getting the large and I enjoy every bite of it. There is always a wait everytime I have been there.. But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome experience...food and ice cream was so yummy!  I highly recommend this place for a family dinner and dessert!"}
{"text":"My blizzard request, m&m and Reese's with just a small amount of chocolate syrup ratios were perfect. It did seem like the workers were a little confused on my total order for a second but ultimately it all came out correct. I can handle an extra second in the drive thru, especially when it is made how I like it!"}
{"text":"At 10:45 both their drive through and front doors were locked. Could see employees inside, but the ignored me. They open at 10:00. When I called them, they answered the phone at least. They had all kinds of excuses as to why both the drive in and front doors were locked. Got my meal right away (I was the only one in there), so at least there's that."}
{"text":"This location has the worst service. Not friendly and EXTREMELY slow. I live in the area and would recommend the extra drive to Luv It's Custard or anywhere else. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"We just left your location at 8889 w Peoria peoria az 85345 ... we purchased 4 blizzards and she handed us each blizzard with lids and did not flip not one of them and when asked about the policy regarding the flip or free ... the cashier acted as tho she did not hear my husband ... when he repeated himself the \"manager\" claimed she did and said that  the passanger (me) saw her ... first I did not even look up until I was handed my blizzard second she (refused to give name) \"manager\" was not at the drive thru when we handed our blizzards third she was very rude and gave us a \"free\" blizzard coupon $5 & $6 buck lunch with free sunday n upgrade to small blizzard for $1 w/$1 cross off ... finaly all 4 blizzard taste like sour milk with no flavoring"}
{"text":"Excellent service as always. Best swirl cones in town."}
{"text":"So-so experience. Have not been in awhile and place wasn't busy at all. Service was qyite slow as only one person was working right after school which is probably a busy time for them.  Kids had a strawberry sundae with a bannanna smoothie. The sundae was perfect but the smoothie was not very good. Are not alot of places for ice cream so might give it another try."}
{"text":"I had the turkey BLT.   Wish they were more generous with the turkey.    They took a long time to bring us ketchup back to the table.   Other than that, the  French frys were tasty and small sundae was great."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the wife for a blizzard.  Very small, but clean little place with very friendly young staff.  The Oreo blizzard was great!"}
{"text":"It's just Ice Cream... 4 bucks for a 12 oz blizzard is crazy.. For that money I should have gone to a creamery and had something higher quality..."}
{"text":"Since when is asking for a single side of barbecue sauce or honey mustard at the window something baffling? The girl looked at me like I was asking for a unicorn. And something they charge for? \"Uhhh, I mean it's 27 cents for sauce but I can give you a pack of ketchup\"  They seemed to be weird about basic stuff. Girl had to go ask the manager if I could order a single grilled chicken breast on the side. It took 3 explanations \"grilled chicken, cut up\". \"Okay we can do fried chicken strips\"...No, I said grilled, dude. I know you gave it- I also ordered a grilled chicken sandwich.   We go onto the Dairy Queen on Stephanie enough- they never have these problems.  What the heck?  Never mind. Taking off one of the two stars I originally put:  Turns out my chicken sandwich had no sauce whatsoever! Comical, if it weren't inedible.  Also, apparently even after three explanations and the cost of a full sandwich (which is fine), they still couldn't manage \"grilled chicken, cut up.\"  This is minimum wage robot shit, not rocket surgery. Get it together people.   Seriously, just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars! This place smelled awful as soon as you walked in the door. We should've just left right away. My kids got the vanilla ice cream cone and banana split. I went to the store after to go shopping and my oldest daughter got so sick and vomited in the aisle and it lasted all night. When I got home my middle daughter was also vomiting which lasted all night. My husband and I got a smoothie and Julius so we didn't get sick. I felt so bad for my girls! I'm not sure if it was because this place is unsanitary or if they are just not clean! We will never ever go to this location again!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Dairy Queen I have ever gone to. The manager was sour and really disrespectful when taking my order. He seemed annoyed by me even placing an order. I ordered a blizzard and it didn't for at least 10 mins. And when I got it he didn't flip it! I didn't even want to tell him because I knew he wouldn't honor the DQ code. Never go here."}
{"text":"Awful service! They were serving people who came after my party! We only ordered blizzards and cones. When I asked about it, I was given attitude! If you want to be treated fairly do not come here!!!  I would also like to add that the floor was extremely dirty!"}
{"text":"I went into Dairy Queen one morning around 9 and was greeted (or not really because he said nothing but gave me an evil look) a very mean-looking man in a baseball cap at the counter. He gave this WTF look as I was approaching. I was going to order a drink and he rudely said we're not open. I said well your door was open. He then said didn't you read the sign, and I said no. With an annoying tone he said that they needed the door open for their employees. I asked him if he was the owner and he ignored me. I take it that he was. I will never return that place again with jerks that work there like that man."}
{"text":"It's a small Dairy Queen and the menu is limited. Stopped there last week with my grandson and they didn't have any meals or food really. We got a hot pretzel which wasn't the best tasting. We also bought a cookie dough blizzard and strawberry Sunday. They were just ok. I love Dairy Queen food and ice cream. This one  definitely needs improvement."}
{"text":"Arrived at about 9:15pm (they close at 10pm) after looking forward to a blizzard treat all evening. We were told that they had run out of ice cream. How does a f***ing dairy queen run out of ice cream!?!"}
{"text":"Went to this location once. The incompetent morons charged me twice, on two different days, for one visit. Called to talk to a manager, told he wasn't even there. Clearly, the incompetence starts at the top and goes down at this place."}
{"text":"Dr Mr. Manager.   Why are you such a jerk? I didn't want a cheeseburger. I wanted a hamburger. So when I ordered a cheeseburger with the cheese on the side (as it was part of the deal) you refused. You said it was because of the liners / bags were all accounted for.   I get it. Fast food economically efficient because of these systems.   But really man. Put it on a napkin. Throw it in the garbage. I don't care what you do with the darn cheese just don't put it on my burger.   He insisted that I peel it off myself. This proved impossible as he microwaved my burger with the cheese on it.   I've decided to eat these burgers. And to throw up at your doorstep when my allergy to your cheese kicks in.   Your fault. Not mine. You see sir... You have your policies and I have mine; namely that I insist on throwing up food on the persons property that served it to me.   I might even make this a weekly thing!"}
{"text":"*imagining what my dog must have thought, in his words*  Vanilla cone was sooo good! Wish I could eat it dipped in chocolate but that will not be good. PSA friends, don't eat any chocolate or raisins, it can kill you!  My favorite part was when my hooman bought it for me, then gave it to me and we ate it outside. The ice cream as soft and creamy, and I ate all the way down to the cone.  Until our next adventure!  Woof woof!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this DQ 4 stars because fast food chains top out at 4 stars.    This location is far superior to the one near my house (http://www.yelp.com/biz/dairy-queen-chandler-3?hrid=y2Q2uNjOUzquKVlrPTdGyQ).  First impressions: the lot the building is sitting on is welcoming.  Well lit.  No pawn shop next door.  If you go inside,  the store is clean, bright, and has smiling faces behind the counter (within reason).  I almost always get a Butterfinger blizzard.  They pack the cup full of candy, giving me my money's worth.  Speaking of money... in the drive-thru, they always tell me my total at the speaker (no \"I'll have your total at the window\").  It's a small touch, but it proves that they either can add, or have invested in a register with a computer.  That instills a certain level of confidence.  The customer service is great.  I always get basic manners like \"please\" and \"thank you\", maybe even \"how's your evening?\".  The service is quick, and they can move a long line along with ease.    If you are closer to Arizona Ave and Ray Rd, make the drive to this location instead. Trust me."}
{"text":"So I asked the kid who took my money and gave me change to wash his hands as he started to make our ice cream. He said sure. I watch him in the mirror up top and he washes his hands and then adjusts his hat and hair again. Lol. I know this happens I just don't want to see it! Ice cream was good and that's all I have except for wash your hands and don't have food code violations and make my food. Thanks"}
{"text":"The drive through order taker was very rude, and interrupted me several times to ask questions she would have had answers to had she not interrupted me! Also, she asked me if there was \"anything else\" EVERY TIME I spoke.  The experience at the window wasn't much better. I ordered ice cream as well as hot food, so my order took a little longer to process (which is to be expected). Instead of greeting me, taking my payment and giving me my drink I was left to sit for 5 minutes wondering if I should just drive away. In my past experiences this DQ has always been horrible, but today's interactions prompted me to post here as well as on their website."}
{"text":"Went here at 2:50 ish to go through the drive thru and pickup lunch. Ordered and paid for our food at 2:59 pm with a female employee who was very friendly. Sat waiting for about 9 mins at the window when a man walks up to the window and opens it and says \"hi I'm ___ can I help you\" I say, yes I'm waiting for my food I already paid for. He looks confused and closes the window and walks away. Comes back and asks me to please pull to the front to wait because the customers behind me have ice cream. I do and I wait another 4 mins before going inside. Inside there's a guy waiting in line who I spoke to briefly and had been standing there for about 5 mins without anyone taking his order. We both wait and another customer comes from the dining room and stands off to the side obviously waiting for her food as well. Finally the guy from the drive thru comes to the front and the male in line tells him help me first.  I say \"hi, I've been waiting about 15 mins for my food can I either have it or my money back\" he says \" I just asked you to park not long ago\" I say \"and I waited at the window nearly 10 mins, look at the time on my receipt\" he takes the receipt and disappears, comes back with my food and gives it to me. The customers waiting were super friendly, that's the only positive thing I have to say about this Dairy Queen. Go to the one on Decatur and Cactus, much friendlier and faster."}
{"text":"I went to this location on a busy Saturday. They were not accepting credit cards. I came back on Monday following for an apple pie blizzard. Guess what: STILL not accepting credit cards. Give me a break. Do you pay the lease at your establishment to turn away at least 60% of your business? Get out of here. I used to visit this location bc of how nice it was finished and great service, however there are at least 5 DQ's in Monroeville I can choose from. Bye-bye!"}
{"text":"I typically only comment about restaurants that I like but I have to make an exception here.  I was walking through the food court at Chandler Mall and could not help but gravitate to the Big banner at DQ that said \"Hot Dogs $1.99\".    When I ordered the dog the cashier asked me what I wanted on it.  Coming from Chicago, I asked for mustard, relish and onions.  He then proceeded to tell me that my total was $2.69.  I asked him what happened to the $1.99 dog.  He said that only comes with mustard or ketchup and that you have to pay extra for relish and onions.  I said ok.  Then, when I got the dog there were onions on it and they gave me a package of relish and a package of mustard.  This is what I paid extra for!  Crazy... stick to the Sunday's here....  I know this is petty, but it rubbed me the wrong way.  A classic case of bait and switch!"}
{"text":"Almost consistently poor quality and service at the Bell rd DQ  The blizzards are always melted, getting order wrong is not unusual and there is typically no form of apology either. I love DQ but this location disappoints. Hope they step up their game and stay in business"}
{"text":"Sticky cups, wrong change, training day??? Heaven help them! I saw five  customers walk in as I left! Hope they count their own change!"}
{"text":"The peanut buster parfait I had had such a measly amount of hot fudge. For $6.79 - big disappointment."}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers, Do not go here. The ice cream taste funny and if you want a refund they cannot issue you one since they use a credit machine. To save all the hassle just avoid it unless you want to take a chance. I went and asked for a blizzard and all I was ice cream with crumbs literally all crumbs no solid pieces and the lady charged me a little more. I asked for a oreo cheesecake blizzard and she started adding things up that almost equal 5$ I didn't question her then after I got my blizzard I started digging through and there was nothing in it. I asked if she added anything and she just nodded. But then as I ate the ice cream it wasn't good so I asked can I get a refund she told me no right away and said to pick something else. I asked if she could void the transaction and again I got a no. She just told me to pick something else. So I did but still not satisfied."}
{"text":"Gentlemen here are always wonderful and nice and I am glad the location is conventional"}
{"text":"Orange Julius drinks used to be one of my favorite places to stop at the mall. But the last 2 times I have gone have proven to be a waste of time and money.  Typically, a Julius is like a smoothie w some sort of malt mix in it or something that makes it slightly different from your average smoothie. Also, it's super delicious. But the last 2 times employees have tried to fool me with garbage. I end up paying 5 dollars for a cup of watery drink mix. Smoothies aren't supposed to be watery! And just because there's a 2 inch thick layer of foam on top does NOT mean that whatever is underneath will resemble a smoothie in any way.  I guess the people here just don't know how to read how to make it... Or they don't have the recipe written down! Will not be coming here again unless I feel like informing the employee I'm not paying for liquid garbage.  Goodbye prized drink of my childhood :/"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Both times I've asked for a Blizzard with Reese's PB Cups. Both times I've been given a Blizzard with cookie dough. Seriously? If you don't know the mix ins, don't make the Blizzard. Let someone make it who knows the difference."}
{"text":"This is the worst DQ.  The worst.  How I lament that it is so close to my house, for it is so tempting to take the risk and go to this location rather than drive to a decent one.  What risk, you ask?  Estimated 50% chance your order will be wrong in some way.  That's pretty good odds for Vegas, not so good in a food service establishment.  I have gotten the wrong size, the wrong flavors, and charged the wrong amount.  Once, when there were 4 of us ordering 3 mini butterfingers blizzards and 1 small heath blizzard, we got charged for 4 minis and received 2 small butterfingers, 1 mini butterfingers, and one mini heath.  When we complained (mostly about the mini heath that was supposed to be small) they said we were getting a good deal since we paid for minis.  Basically it wasn't what we ordered or what we wanted, but it was a good value, so don't complain.  Approximately 65% chance the service will leave something to be desired.  There's one employee who has potential to be professional, but who has included some inappropriate humor with the order.  One girl said two words to us during our encounter.... \"hey\" and \"lids?\".  We've had rude explanations as to why coupons or Groupons couldn't be redeemed.    On the occasions where nothing went wrong, the product just wasn't up to bar.  Other locations put a lot more \"stuff\" in the blizzards, for example.  The only reason I go here is because it's so close to home, but it really is worth it to drive the extra couple of miles to Alma School and Guadalupe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/dairy-queen-mesa-6?hrid=OQgseDedrt8siQmewj_xRQ)."}
{"text":"Usually this place is great, and the owner is sweet.. But after having my food shoved at me and sarcastically told to have a great night while the lady slammed the window.. I think I'm good, and I hope she heard how pleased I was with her service!"}
{"text":"This is a smaller DQ and I believe the menu is smaller as well. I can recall the last DQ I went to had a variety of food as well. This one only had hot dogs. But we were there for the ice cream so it didn't bother us.   I've never been super impressed with DQ. They only have soft serve and only have chocolate and vanilla. They will make other flavors for you but they have to mix it in so you can only get it in a cup."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a banana split. Ended up waiting for 30 minutes in the drive thru. Lady at the drive thru wasn't very friendly either."}
{"text":"I went around 5pm tonight. People waiting for their order before me. My order was for 2 medium blizzards. Time on my order 5:19pm. 30 minutes later I received my order! The blizzards were soft and runny.  Was very disappointed! There were about 10 employees in back and they didn't seem to have anyone to lead them. No organization at all. Most didn't seem to know how or what to do. Where was a manager or supervisor???"}
{"text":"DUMMY! What a mean crabby lady serving crappy poorly dipped cherry dip cones. I say poop on you!"}
{"text":"The staff and owner here are always very friendly and helpful. All the ice cream, drinks, and food is made fresh upon ordering!   My personal favourite is the strawberry cheesecake blizzard. I love strawberry flavoured ice cream and the cheesecake chunks blend in perfectly with it. The cheesecake chunks taste just like New York cheesecake! I'm drooling already just by thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"Very slow and they didn't follow instructions with no whip cream. The ice cream was to go and they overfilled to so getting lids was extremely difficult. The food was ok though."}
{"text":"Now, I am not much to write about chain fast food restaurants, but I felt that I should give a shout out to the Saturday night crew. I pulled up and they were busy in the drive through. The girl taking orders was fast, very courteous, and offered extra fixings on something I didn't actually know you could get extras on. When I pulled up to the window I was greeted by 2 different people which is rare, sometimes at fast food joints you can barely get a total out of the person at the window. I watched how they were operating as a team and having worked in fast food before, I found it to be a well oiled machine. When you're scored on every second of a transaction, that counts. Props to the girls working on the floor that night. And my ice cream was good too :)"}
{"text":"I love coming to this Dairy Queen it's all there are always friendly Great customer service ice cream and lunch is always fresh and fast they have many deserts to choose from even ice cream cakes"}
{"text":"Simple Dairy Queen. Nothing to brag about. Service was decent, but not too friendly. If you just want a simple Blizzard or soft-serve, this place is perfect, but like I said, just a simple Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen - the terrible treats I grew up on and was given as a reward for getting good grades and such.  Nowadays, Dairy Queen, or more specifically, a Dairy Queen Blizzard, is my regular self-reward for a job well done, a job done poorly, supreme happiness, a bad day, etc etc.  I honestly don't understand how a blizzard (Snickers, to be exact) tastes so much better from Dairy Queen than a similar packaged grocery store ice cream or some of the copy-cats out there.  But it does!    This location typically has a drive-through line almost to the street, and parking in the tiny lot/drive-through area is a mess at best (if you park and go inside, the drive-through line snaking around the building will unfortunately completely block you in).  But my order has always been correct and the drive-through moves reasonably fast (unless you're behind someone who got a hot food order, in which case, get comfy!)  Staff are friendly, as well, even though it seems like they are always slammed.  Budget tip: sign up for the DQ email list and you will get I believe 6 buy one, get one free coupons via email."}
{"text":"Good ole DQ. Still has the Mr Misty Freeze.  Try one. I guess it is now on the secret menu."}
{"text":"One of the best treats on a warm day. We frequent this location a few times a week and the lines are always out the door and the drive thru spans the parking lot. I appreciate how they tend to hire high school kids but there is a need for an adult manager. These kids freak out under pressure and someone needs to help them. Take a deep breath and focus on consistency. Aside from bad service when busy the product is usually less than desirable. The product shouldn't lack quality just because they are busy.   My recommendation to management is to focus on a \"Team Lead\" or \"Shift Leader\" to work with these kids to train them properly. It's total chaos also a number system for your orders would help immensely orders come out and you don't know if it is your order or someone else.   Aside from the management the location is good!   Horrible Service.  So Slow. Zero Urgency.   Always a line and too many frustrated kids. Ugh. There are at least 6 people working with no process. Please implement a process where people work more efficiently."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen. Growing up in Michigan, their treats could only be enjoyed in the summer months. I was certain I would gain twenty pounds when I moved into Plaza Midwood and this location was a short two block walk from my house.   I had no need to worry though because this DQ is consistently subpar. It's not the lack of seating. It's not the long lines. The problem is that the ice cream is soupy. It's almost as if they melt the ice cream prior to creating blizzards.   Blizzards are supposed to be served upside down to show off their thickness. If a blizzard from this DQ was served upside down, you'd have to change your shoes after it splattered out of the cup.   This is a consistent problem in fall and summer. The owners need to fix their machines because they have lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Hours must be incorrect because I was there 5minutes before closing and it was already locked up.  I went out of my way to go there so I was really annoyed.  I will never patronize them."}
{"text":"I've currently been sitting here for ten minutes waiting for a single strawberry blizzard.  There are three people in here with me, one woman who has been here way longer than I have. Not a single order has been given to anyone inside yet.  In total I have been here for 20 min and I got back some totally melted blizzards and ice cream that I sent it back and now I have been waiting for my large blizzard.  My strawberry blizzard was only half mixed. The last two inches were vanilla ice cream. Also there were Oreo chunks in it and surprising the family before me got Oreo blizzards.. clean your machines.   I asked for a manager and I got a regular employee.  Manager please step up and resolve the issues."}
{"text":"Awful place. I would not recommend coming here. Drive the extra couple of miles to find another. It's dirty inside, the people are assholes and they never have any products. A veritable dump."}
{"text":"Detroit Ave Dairy Queen FTW!  I celebrate my 200th review by celebrating something I enjoy almost as much as pizza: ice cream.  Specifically, blizzards. And let me tell you, there was nothing I wanted more at 9:30 last night than a chocolate blizzard with Heath bar.   And I got it!! Oh, Dairy Queen. You always come through when I need you. It had been a full year since my last blizzard.  I was almost greedy and got a medium, but the small was more than enough. A weird surprise: they now have a \"mini\" size. Not that I would ever order a mini.  No matter how much time goes by between visits to a DQ, I never forget how frickin' delicious it is!!! Once a summer just about does it, though, and now I can go on living my life without this obsession hanging over my head."}
{"text":"I went to redeem  my free small blizzard for my birthday and was told that they don't use the app. So why is there an app then I like going to this Dairy Queen because it's close and convenient and I don't need to go to aliante casino. Forgot today was free frappe day so it was really crowded. I wanted to try the small apple pie blizzard since it was suppose to be free. But instead I got my usual large Reese peanut butter blizzard. I'm a little disappointed and when I asked why they don't use the app I was told that's the rules."}
{"text":"Delicious treats and friendly counter help. Drive-through was closed. We are glad we drove from the interstate"}
{"text":"Super fast service and our order was accurate when we pulled through the drive-thru for a late-night blizzard snack!"}
{"text":"I'll be surprised if this place lasts a year. I paid $5 for drink, hot pocket, bag of chips, and the saddest sundae you've ever seen. It was so small I actually thought they built it in the lid, upside down. I came through the drive through. The menu board is already broken being held with electrical tape. Very hard to understand the csr through the speaker but he was very friendly at the window. They don't have burgers or fries and was told it was because the place too small. Actually went again that evening inside and it was pretty big inside. Hmmm"}
{"text":"And if I could give zero stars I would. 25 minutes to get a bottle of water. Issues taking an order for 3 blizzards. Had to be rung up twice. Seating on the street outside was cleaner than the booths. Staff was a mess and all over the place. DQ Corp please shut this place down it's ruining your brand."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this DQ for my frozen milky sugar for years, and I have also been insisting that my children and their friends order their treats with an accent or they don't get any.  Literally 10+ years, I've been subjecting the workers of this fine establishment to mine and my youngsters' rendition of Southern, Irish, Australian, etc.  It is a rule, in my family.  You don't get DQ unless you order it with an accent. These DQ employee troopers always play along, even when they think we're making a joke on them.  I assure you, DQ family, we are not joking on YOU, we love you, and we adore that you let us do our weird thing.  THANK YOU!   P.S. If you want to throw an accent of your own back at us, we'd probably really love it!"}
{"text":"Left me and my step daughter standing there for five minutes without saying a word. It looked like the manager and three employees were so engrossed making blizzards they couldn't sell two more... It's official Dairy Queen on Fort Apache and Sunset sucks..."}
{"text":"It took 41mins to get our food and we were the only people in line waiting, it was a big order but it shouldn't take that long!!"}
{"text":"I smile just thinking about Dairy Queen's ice cream cake. Mmmmmm....  I ordered a cake from here and they couldn't put Speedracer on the cake so I got plain balloons instead. It still tasted good.   This is a smaller store, but it's never been packed when I've been there. It's conveniently close to 17th Ave.  Their peanut buster parfaits are yummy as is pretty much any flavour of Blizzard."}
{"text":"Delicious sundaes. I especially enjoyed my time there with the manager getting involved to do a refund for me. The service was spectacular while the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I always come here when I have an ice cream craving and never had a issue when I was there. The service is nice and so is the people but I don't know how it is inside considering I use the drive through. I've been here multiple times and always get what I want. The new lava cake has me wanting to come back again!"}
{"text":"Have lunch with my family. We came in to eat which is not like us. The staff was very fast and friendly. The place was very clean. We put in order and was give a pager. The food was brought to the table hot and fresh. Very polite staff. Everything was clean and stocked at the drink tower. Ice cream is always great."}
{"text":"The employees are ALWAYS friendly and prompt. They make a delicious Banana shake! The area is a bit questionable but it's worth it if you are in the mood for something sweet and cold."}
{"text":"Had a delicious cheesequake oreo blizzard! My friend got a reese bizzard. What so special about this time, we got one and got another one for only $0.99 .. I believe that it is limited time offer!   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this: I LOVE ICE CREAM!!!!  Really though, who doesn't?  I no longer get excited for b-days to get presents but rather push them aside like a maniac and just slam my fork on the table until a piece of DQ ice cream cake is in front of me.  MMMMMM Ice cream AND cake, all in 1?!?!  This has to be one of the best creations ever.  Too bad my birthday isn't for another 341 days :-( I cursed this location the first few months it opened since I drive by it almost every day and it seems to whisper my name.    \"pssst, Mike, pssst, blizzard, pssst, ice cream cake\"  Anyways, this DQ is brand new in McKenzie Towne and pretty standard inside.  There seems to be a good amount of staff so the long lines go quick as does the wait for the heavenly goodness.  The prices are standard for DQ (can get kinda pricey given that most ice cream items are around $5, but usually worth it).  Even though the large blizzard is a few cents more than the smaller sizes you probably dont need to get it unless you want to explode like an over-inflated balloon or share with 5 of your closest friends.  I can't really comment on the grill side and to be honest only realized they had something other than ice cream when I pass other locations with the \"1 day only 99 cent burger\" signs which seem to be out year round.  Guess it is one day only, everyday yaaaaaaay.  That is actually the reason I rated 4 instead of 3 as this location does not have the 99 cent 1 day only sign.  April underdog challenge 2/30"}
{"text":"Melt Me NOT!! How is this place still in business?? I have been here 3 times and this was the last! I was here last night, ordered a small sundae and a large Blizzard. The sundae was on the counter when I pulled up to the window, as it sat melting the woman was making the Blizzard, which she dropped all over the counter. She evidently yelled for help because there were 3 other employees that made an appearance, a large guy took over for her while she probably went to wash up as it was all over her hand. He made it, handed them both to me- no FLIP OR FREE and it was fairly runny, the sundae was half melted and when I said \"Yes I want whipped cream and cherry\" she said \"It is Black Cherry\",  I said \"That is Fine\". I did not know until I got my receipt for a charge of $10.55 that there was a 49 cent charge for the cherry- seriously, this is the worst Dairy Queen I have ever been to and DQ should pull their name from this location! For $10.55 I could have bought 2 gallons of GOOD ice cream!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever! My wife and 2 boys went there on 5-5-18 to get a snack and Ice Cream. Wife got a burger that landed her in the emergency room. She had the burger at 7:30 pm and woke up at 1am with her stomach not happy. And after 2 hours of sitting and kneeling on the throne we decided to go to the hospital. We were told she has food poisoning. She was the only one to have a burger. While we were there I noticed that a guy was there from an A/C repair place. Maybe they were having issues with their coolers. Stay away from the burgers here."}
{"text":"Honestly I drive 20 minutes here instead of the Dairy Queen that is down the block from my neighborhood because the service is actually friendly and fast. They never are \"all out\" of a certain item and bonus: they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"This is an old-school DQ store, with a classic drive up / lounge out front patio setup. Loads of parking for the lazy ass you never walk even a few blocks, as I admit I never have walked here (it's north of the tracks, so I'm really slumming it.)  Staff are usually helpful with describing what desserts are like, and listen to specific requests (I like less chocolate sauce for example, for a less drowned in sugar and HFCS flavor.)  Needless to say this is not high-quality food you are expecting, but highly-processed ice cream and to me most of the toppings taste like sugar on top of sugar. It's not great. It's kind of expensive for what you get, being a one-trick pony operation. But it's IS a classic, and what it should be, every time. Enjoy this DQ location!"}
{"text":"After a less than desirable experience during and after ordering ice cream items, the attitudes of the employees was less than to be desired.  What happened to customer service and a positive attitude?  My intention was to ask them with a phone call after our departure rather than this review however they didn't answer the phone after multiple attempts.  Any questions??"}
{"text":"customer service is absolutely horrible.. ordered a #1 combo & was give the wrong order TWICE!!..  went back to fix it after it took 45 mins to get my order wrong again. I so happened to take the time to download the \"MyDQ\" app  for the free blizzard and was denied by the manager who seamed so worked up cause of his sorry staff & lack of management, i walked out without ever getting the right meal..  I decided to try DQ out again, and unfortunately nothing changed. Staff is still unaware of the menu, and took 7 mins to get my order down, they gave me my food cold and falling apart. My fries are refried and still cold.. My burger was burned and tasted like the grill. DQ corp needs to fix this DQ!!"}
{"text":"Blizzard machine was broken, so I settled for a Dilly bar.  Very disappointing.  Just like this review."}
{"text":"Food comes out really fast and tastes great. The place is clean and the guy on the register is ALWAYS really nice"}
{"text":"I come here for the Blizzards - particularly the Brownie Blizzard or the Peanut Butter Smash.  I've only had their hot lunch  food once it was decent nothing special."}
{"text":"Owner was very rude and mean when I asked if they can make ice cream sodas.  Customer service was very poor.  Will not stop at this dairy queen again."}
{"text":"Went to this Dairy Queen got a \"chocolate sundae\" what I was served was a scoop of  sweet ice drowning in Hersheys syrup. I don't think I'll go back to another Dairy Queen - too disappointing!"}
{"text":"My son got a milkshake from this location. There was a fingernail in it! He took something out of his mouth and when we shined a light on it I was disgusted."}
{"text":"Ice cream was prepared properly, however the service is so slow. Only 2 people working at prime time!"}
{"text":"If you're going to go to Dairy Queen I need to go to this one the lady who owns it she trains her people very well they're always nice unlike other Dairy Queens boa so excited that they brought back their smore blizzard it's the best this time I added the hot fudge in the center it was just ok"}
{"text":"Its the neighborhood Dairy Queen. They have a drive through. And it sits right in front of a Jewish Cemetary and across the street from an Auto Zone. It was Monday afternoon and we had just gotten a chance to let supper settle. Even though my daughter didn't finish her dinner, she still wanted ice cream and I have a hard time resisting this two year old.  Unfortunately for the little trooper, its a 10 minute drive to this Dairy Queen (I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror if I called it DQ). She was out by the time we ordered. Well I guess her Mom and I would just have to indulge while she dreamt about it.  I ordered a chocolate and pineapple sundae. Her Mom got the Peanut Buster Parfet. It was just under $8.00 for the both of us. My sundae was just right and there was plenty left over from the Parfet for my little girl.  I like that they have a drivethrough. And while we didn't get any this visit, I also really like their burgers because  they're flame broiled.   The Jewish Cemetery is pretty cool, by the way. I recommend getting an ice cream cone in nice weather and cruising through."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed with this location. If I could give less than 1 star I would. I was ordering blizzards through the drive-thru, and the person on the other end spoke with a stereotypical heavy Indian accent. At the end of my order he even said, \"Thank you. Come again.\"  I think he was trying to pull off an Apu from the Simpsons. It seemed suspicious, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking they might actually be Indian. After pulling up  to the drive thru window, there were two employees working, neither of which was Indian. I even clarified to make sure they were the only two people working that night. I called the kid out at the drive thru and mention that it was very insensitive the way he was behaving, but he didn't seem to give a s***. His ambivalence actually upset me to the point that I called him an f'ing racist and drove off. I love Dairy Queen, but I won't go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"We been going to Dairy Queen for about 10 years and today was the worst service I've ever had  just got out of church and decide to get ice cream on the way home  terrible service I doubt if I go there again"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an after doctor treat with my daughters. I don't always review fast food but in this case I am because the servers there were SO nice. My daughter was asking question after question trying to decide what she wanted and the lady working couldn't have been nicer.  The only uncomfortable moment was when a clearly drugged-out man came running and skipping through. I was nervous as he was definitely on something STRONG. But he skipped out as fast as he came. Still, I might go through the drive-thru next time!"}
{"text":"Had to wait over 10 minutes for our drive through order. Fries were cold and my order was wrong.  Typical fast food restaurant run by teenagers so what can you really expect..."}
{"text":"Horrible...waiting in a drive thru for an ice cream treat shouldn't take 20 minutes. Horrible customer service too. Thank God it's fan food because it sure isn't fast-food!!!"}
{"text":"Pull up to drive thru & order a blizzard. Hand the girl my debit card & it seems like it is taking a long time. She comes to window & says that the machine says \"connecting \", then times out with an error. I told her it's not my card, I have plenty of money. I hear her talking to other person working & saying they have been having problems all day. She asked if I had another way to pay, and I didn't have cash. They try the other machine & same thing. She comes back to the window & tells me sorry the machine keeps saying error & hands me my card back. My blizzard is made...are they going to throw it away?? What kind of customer service is that? I guess this will help me with my weight loss...not going back there!"}
{"text":"Only reason this place gets 2 Stars is because the Blizzard is not deserving of a 0.  Short recap: Ordered a 1/2 lb Flamethrower, drink, fries and an Oreo cookie blizzard with fudge in the middle.     The burger was nasty, and I don't mean that lightly.  For all my old school peeps it was a hamburger a-la-Mondo-Burger from Good Burger type deal.  The burger was a big, had over cooked and dry patties, wilted lettuce, old tomatoes. Completely unappealing and unsavory.  0 Stars.     The fries did not fare much better.  Old & stale, flimsy not crispy, after a few threw them away fries.  Sad showing.  0 Stars.     The only bright spot of the whole meal?  The Blizzard.  Always satisfying, cool, sweet but not ridiculously sweet like say an Oreo cookie shake from Burger King which tastes like you're sucking diabetes through a straw.  The blizzard hit the spot in this \"cool\" 95 degree weather here in Vegas.  It had a great mix of Oreo cookies, fudge was really good tasting.  The Blizzard is a winner.  5 Stars.     About the service.  I've never come across an unhappy worker here, and although the food could be better prepared I believe it's more of people working with products that they're given to work with than them actually having a good product to put out to the public.  That's just my opinion hence 3 Stars.  Add that up divide by 4 and you get 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Arrived at 4:59:41 to grab a quick happy hour drink that ended at 5pm but the man at counter would not ring me in. I left the restaurant and got my beverage elsewhere."}
{"text":"They lag it here. Been in line for 15 min now. Line has gone out the door. They haven't attended anyone yet."}
{"text":"Filthy and all the employees (kids) were goofing off, laughing and having a grand time not working. The second attempt at our ice cream, the order arrived correctly.  Ice cream tasted ok but filthy, unclean restaurant. Manager was the only person up front trying to work. Crazy!"}
{"text":"This place needs new blood. I'm for hiring enthusiastic older staff but not unfriendly, slow staff that make a rather poor quality sundae or shake. I prefer the Kennedy location."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. It is disgusting and the owner is one of the rudest, apathetic people I've ever met. Dirty and gross, and not worth the money ."}
{"text":"My experience was very good. I received my purchase in a timely manner and received great ice cream. The store was clean and the associates were friendly."}
{"text":"totally unprofessional!!! rude crass kids working here refusing to make food claiming they do not sell food at this location when i bought the damn hot dog meal last tuesday!!! immature male manager being sexually provocative with the 2 female employees in front of my 7 year old kid! will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here with our dog on a hot summer day...they give him a dog treat!  We have gone thru other DQ's but when we ask for a dog treat they say no.  :(  The staff is always vibrant, energetic and friendly...they make you happy just driving thru!!!  We now make sure whenever we go for a ride with our pup we make sure we stop in here for a treat for the WHOLE fam!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Dairy Queen, I've been eating there for most of my life. The only thing I don't like is the slow service at the drive thru.sometimes I would like to stop and get something but just don't have time to wait that long. ThAts the only thing I would change. Such delicious food and great tea. Love u , love u , love u"}
{"text":"Stopped here because I had been craving a cookie dough blizzard and an order of fries.  Well the fries were good, hot, and fresh but I don't think I got the cookie dough blizzard.  I've had 1 before and this was not it.  Not happy and disappointed with what I received."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and although we were happy to finally have a DQ closer to home, this one is a major disappointment. They have yet to get an order correct. During one trip, we ordered a cheeseburger with only ketchup. (I know, I know, picky eaters!) Seems easy enough. Opened the burger to find they had put mustard on it and tried to correct it by scraping it off. What?!?!? The manager came out to argue with us that it was made correctly. Good times! I will drive the extra few miles to go to a different location."}
{"text":"I've come here 3 times now, and received blatanly unenthusiastic service, messed up orders, and a blizzard ordered extra cheesecake, with less than the normal amount. I'm not going to waste my money somewhere I won't at least receive a little service, let alone consistent food practices."}
{"text":"If you were born on the 90s, you probably remember the days when simple fast food was cheap. Where a full combo didn't cost over $6. well, price inflation is scary. These days are long gone, and a quick meal at a food court will cost you $10. The only exception seems to be the DQ $6 meal deal. Which includes a full combo plus ice cream for way less than what's typical these days. The meal includes a simple hot light meal, by simple I mean 2 chicken wraps, cheeseburger, or  3 chicken strips, seems like a larger sized kids meal, but it's so much fun with all the choices. And the best part, chose your dessert! the $6 includes a sundae, your choice of flavour. Or for a dollar extra you can get a mini blizzard, which has so many different kinds! After your meal, burn off the extra calories by jumping into the wave pool at the leisure centre across from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"So, today is my birthday!! We have always loved DQ, and eat here often, mostly for the $6 meal deals and the sundaes. But for the first time in 6 years, I got another DQ cake today! Last time was in 2010, when I said i wanted an ice cream cake, and she got me one. There was only one problem.. she told the cashier lady to put \" World's best mom\" on it. Not on purpose but she only paid attention to the teddy bear design, and not the words on the design. Ok, I get it, my mom is the best. But I swear that I did  NOT have a baby at 16, and currently only have a 7 year old brother and not a 6 year old child. So this time, my mom drove us to DQ, and I picked the cake. I picked a vanilla one with pink icing and four roses on it.  I've just turned 22, and do not judge on the fact I will always be 5 years old on the inside.  that We thought about getting a strawberry cheesecake one, but the cashier girls, who were very nice, said that these were blizzard cakes. Ok, Do not judge once again, but I don't like blizzards. Also, I've had a strawberry cheesequake blizzard for my 11th birthday and didn't like it very much. Plus the blizzard cakes are smaller and more expensive( like $1 more than the regular ice cream cakes) The regular cakes, I tried to order one last night, but if you want a custom made cake be sure to  order at least 2 days in advanced. Online, all designed are available in the medium sized round ones and the large rectangle ones for huge parties. If you haven't ordered one, don't worry as they have plenty in store and plenty of design variety. There are ones covered with chocolate icing and ones with vanilla icing, and each cake has an extra whipped cream decorated border around it. The pink roses one i got was also available in yellow. If you want them to write\" Happy birthday\" on it, they can do so for free. They will ask if you want a specific colour icing or just whatever colour matches, and i said do whatever colour to match, and got pink icing.  The girl wrote in all CAPS but her writing is neat and pretty, I was satisfied. Feel free to put the cake back in the fridge if you want to eat something else there( cause if you leave it outside it will melt). Don't worry about someone else buying your cake because that's not likely. Well, unless someone with the exact same name as you wants the exact same cake, which..what are the chances of that? If someone wanted the same cake as you, they made 3 pink cakes, two of which with roses, so they can just take another one. There are also some themed ones( with food colouring at the top, and hockey figures on it etc). When you get home..wait 20 min before you cut it..of course you can cut it before 20 min.. if you have a chainsaw. The reason it's so hard is that first of all it's frozen..duh..and secondly there's a layer of cookie in the middle of the cake. After 20 min you can through without any problems. These cakes are $34 for the round ones and $40  for the large rectangle ones, so a bit pricey..but no one will make you pay for your own cake on your birthday.. and it's worth the price. Better than the ones at grocery stores..which are half the price, but have too much cream.. and I'm sure that's not real whipped cream, and you can taste the artificial sugars in it."}
{"text":"I recently, like around 8 p.m. on Sunday, January 7th, 2018. A BOGO coupon for blizzards. When I presented the coupon to the cashier, it would only show a tab to press for driving directions to the nearest DQ, which in my case, is at 43rd ave and Dunlap. When I went in to order my blizzards and redeem the coupon, the app, said my coupon had already been redeemed. Anyone else have this experience with the dairy queen app?"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen clearly relies on its primo real estate in burgeoning downtown Gilbert.  I've been to this location twice and I will not go there again.  The service is average, but the soft serve both times was unacceptably soft and the portions were so extremely chintzy I wondered if I were on some sort of candid camera show.  The last time I was there, the girl at the register gave me my receipt and made sure to ask me to rate their service.  I forgot and tossed my receipt in disgust after I finished my overpriced kiddy-size serving of melty soft serve.  Do yourself a favor and drive to the Higley/Baseline location.  Their portions are generous, the soft serve isn't already melting when they hand it to you, and they don't require you to go to the counter for a key to use the restroom."}
{"text":"WOW!!! What an attitude and what a DISAPPOINTMENT this place was tonight!  First off, I pulled into the drive thru with my son and right away someone tried to take my order.  I said \"one moment please\", no response.  Next the Drive thru operator (female) says - \"well tell me when you're ready\" very rude.  I then said \"I'm sorry\" and gave my order.  When I pulled up to the window I noticed an attitude right away.  No smile, no thank you.  Then I asked for a lid to my blizzard and was given a lid for a soft drink!  I also asked for napkins and she shoved three out the window at me.  What's the problem here??"}
{"text":"Normally come in here and get banana splits we tried something different tonight we got the thing called the waffle bowl sundaes ( Turtle) actually this pretty good."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They have no manners. My husband and I went through the drive up, had not finish ordering and the girl asked us to pull to the window didn't even ask if we wanted anything else then when we told her we weren't done she got upset"}
{"text":"Extremely SLOW!!! And then after waiting for 15 minutes in the drive through they handed me my food not in a bag. I haven't had a good experience at this location EVER!"}
{"text":"The worst! Just sat in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes. There was ONE car in front of me. After finally getting up to the window not a word was said to me, nothing...no sorry for the wait or acknowledgement that I was even there. He finally flips my blizzard and then says how much I owe for the food and blizzard, that's it nothing else other than the price. He then gives me my card back with no receipt and my food and then leaves without a word. Absolutely the worst customer service ever! Then to top it off I take a fry from my bag as I pull out and it's COLD, I hadn't even driven out of the parking lot yet. I wait for one other car for over 15 minutes to get atrocious customer service and cold food. Awesome."}
{"text":"I haven't had a Strawberry Julius in years and stopped by the Aliante Station Casino today because they mailed me a bunch of free $15 bet coupons.   The Orange Julius is also a Dairy Queen and is located in the food court of the Aliante Station Casino. I looked over the menu and noticed that they had a hot dog/chips/drink combo. I asked if I could have a Strawberry Julius as my drink. The girl behind the counter said that was only a Dairy Queen Combo and I couldn't sub the drink. I guess I'm not getting a hot dog then...Next I looked at the prices and notice it was $4.79 for a medium julius. I remember it was only $2 in California. I won the $15 free bet so I bought it anyways. It was just how I remembered....except the price."}
{"text":"Not sure why they are so mad here. Got a blizzard and when they gave to me they had a look of death when the handed it to me. Could act like you want to me here."}
{"text":"I've been intrigued by this Dairy Queen ever since I moved to Charlotte. It is the ultimate old school joint with the Eskimo kid holding an ice cream sign on top. Plus who doesn't love ice cream or a blizzard every now and then? Being the history buff I am, I had to research and turns out this is the oldest location left in NC and the third oldest in the Southeast--cool info!  I stopped here the other day to order a Mr. Misty but I guess that name has now changed to something more hardcore, like the Artic Rush (which personally, I think sounds like a Vin Diesel movie) but when I got my cherry Artic Rush, everything was right in the world and I felt like a piece of childhood was in my hands."}
{"text":"Worst Dairy Queen experience ever. I am a huge fan of DQ, don't get me wrong! This location was terrible.  I have always been a lover of the s'mores blizzard, and ever summer I frequent DQ's around AZ. However, this one was a MISTAKE.  The staff was nice. But, when I received my \"s'mores\" blizzard it was MELTED vanilla ice-cream and graham crackers. thats it. There was no chocolate in the ice-cream and it was SOUP when i received it. Something tells me it was sitting there for a while. Would've complained but only stopped in for a quick second.  Other locations get it right, this one gave me melted graham cracker ice-cream.  If I could, I'd give it zero stars"}
{"text":"This is the worst dairy Queen I have ever been too. I asked for a water cup and was given a bathroom disposable cup. I am handicap and had to make several trips to get water to get through my meal. I asked to speak to manager and got the owner who raised his voice at me he was rude. I ordered chicken strips and only had half a container of gravy. They don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"The food is pretty consistent with what you'll get at other DQ locations. The manager/owner guys are really friendly and awesome here, though. I come here often enough that they know what I'm going to order before I order it."}
{"text":"Went to redeem a birthday coupon. Associates went to make it and the manager came in and stopped them and said they don't honor the birthday recognition. They said the owner won't approve that and that he is rude to his employees. Don't give this DQ your business."}
{"text":"Once again this Dairy Queen location is at its finest no ice for drinks. Ice machine down since yesterday. The really sad part talk to the residents through 7hills and Anthem or any surrounding area.  They where so happy to see a new Dairy Queen going in on St. Rose untill we are all finding out same owners.  It's a sad day for Dairy Queens everywhere well maybe they will take more pride in a new building."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen, isn't like most. First off they don't have hamburgers at this location. That to me is like KFC not having chicken.  Oh well if you just like hotdogs, and ice cream then this place will be good for you.  Oh yeah they also sell Julius' here. My son had a grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese wasn't fully melted. That could be a one off thing. Oh, and my hotdog bun was dry.  I will come back. Just not if I'm in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"They get my order wrong literally every single time. Owner needs to step up and fix this terrible DQ. Service is too slow and the ice cream is always melted."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, the workers are disrespectful, the employees don't let you use the restroom, and the food doesn't taste that good. They sometimes give colored people a dirty look which makes me feel highly uncomfortable and just overall a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Lately...crap!! Third strike: got a triple truffle blizzard, counted 9 candy pieces. Oh wait, 10 (final count) pieces. If I wanted a tub of vanilla ice cream I would have ordered it!!  The second strike: food was ice cold. Complained, but no remake of food. Figured I would allow for time to mend their issues.  DQ you are now dead to me!!!"}
{"text":"In the land of Dairy queen, they haven't done anything to really change it since you were a kid. Not bad burgers. Ok everything else. Good ice cream, but not great. Go here for a cone, but don't expect too much!"}
{"text":"Very nice and new. Staff is always friendly but the drive thru is ridiculous. Two burgers and a diet soda and Im still sitting here 10 minutes after the fact? People have stuff to do. I could cook a meal at home in this time."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I work in the same shopping plaza and man every time I've been here it's just bad customer service. The only time I had decent customer service was from a kid who looked like he was 12!! The elders were horrible! I even ordered a blizzard once and you know how they do the flip the cup over thing to show it's \"that good\" well....they had to make me a new one so that was entertaining to watch haha the only good reason to come here is for the $5 lunch, sometimes it's worth to sit through the bad customer service especially when you only have a short amount of time for lunch like me!"}
{"text":"This is the  worst dairy queen in the valley. Service is slow and the place is dirty. Dont waste your money. Spend it  elsewhere."}
{"text":"My rating is not based on quality of food/dessert, this rating/review is solely based on the emotionally, verbally abusive terrorist manager that was running the shift tonight. There were about a dozen of us that came in at around 645pm and a few more small families and individuals who trickled in after in the 1 hour duration we were there. It seemed the manager Joseph got somehow overwhelmed and was stomping around talking crap. At first I thought he was just a regular team member as his professionalism was non-existent as he demeaned another employee in front of my party. (I promise this is an understatement). For the whole hour we were there, he was just ripping everyone a new one, dropping things on the floor, yelling at every single team member...and when I say at every single one, I really mean literally and very audibly where the whole store can hear. As we got up to leave, I parked myself near the register as there's a little side counter next to the registers. At that point, Joseph was on a rampage telling all of his employees \"I'll write all of your a*s' up! I'm the manager!!!\" Now as a manager myself of a corporate level business, I was absolutely appalled at his behavior. All of the team members were head down trying to get through their orders and Joseph verbally bashing the entire team, putting on public display his disgusting power trip. I feel SO bad for that team and if Joseph was my employee, he would be fired on the spot for inciting work place hostility. I hope the owner of this establishment is reading this because something NEEDS to be done with that guy. He is a disaster and he is bad for business and work place morale. This has been, by far, the worst manager I've ever seen. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Got the wrong order here , how was chicken strips confused with chicken sandwich ? Ruined my day , that day happened to be Sunday. Life is too short to be displeased on a Sunday. The blizzards are the 10x better than sonic blasts, mcflurrys, and any nearby soft serve."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Dairy Queen. If your in a hurry and thinking of using the drive thru I would HIGHLY recommend you don't. I'm writing this while waiting in line right now. I've been waiting for 10 minutes and no signs of moving any time soon."}
{"text":"This is probably the slowest fast food restaurant I have ever been too.   If your coming here and need to be in a hurry I would suggest you call in about 15 minutes in advance.    I ordered a sandwich and onion rings and fries and waited 12 minutes in the drive thru and I was the only person in line!"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen/Orange Julius has been a welcomed addition to the Fort Mill area.  They can be very busy at times - afternoons for that sweet treat!  It has been several years since I have been to DQ and they do not have blizzard flavors like they used to, really limited compared to the past.  My favorite used to be the mint oreo, but that now is one of the monthly specials rather than year round.  I had the monthly special in April - which was the Reeses Extreme - it was awesome!  Wish they kept that year round.  At any rate, as much as I would like to have a blizzard every time, we usually stop in for an Orange Julius smoothie.  They only have 3 flavors (right now 4 since they have a monthly special).  We have tried the strawberry banana (good), mango pineapple (our favorite) and the monthly special of the strawberry watermelon (disappointment, only taste the strawberry).    Even though the drive through is long, it usually goes very quickly.  We go through the drive through since we have our pup with us and they offer a small free pup cup!  Rocky loves it and has it finished before we even get our single smoothie that my husband and I share."}
{"text":"Its your normal DQ...the kids work their butts of for fast service But what makes this DQ stand out are the people u met in line ... Always smiling and laughing...great area.  Great people !!!"}
{"text":"Great location! Fast and very very friendly service! The atmosphere is very nice. Family oriented! And delicious all the way around!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I even realized this was here before tonight.  Thank goodness it is!  From time to time you just gotta have some DQ.  The kids behind the counter were pleasant, respectful, and pour a hearty cup."}
{"text":"I am very very disappointed in this DQ!  I ordered a birthday cake for my daughter's 8th birthday this past Wednesday for a pick up on Saturday.  I asked for a cute girlie design and spelled my daughters name, Savannah, to the guy at least 5 times.  When I came to pick it up they had spelled her name wrong and there was not ANY design on it!  The cake was the generic Oreo cake they have in the freezers with \"Happy Birthday Savanna\" in Pink.  There is NOTHING girlie about that! I was pretty upset because I had asked the guy taking the order to have the decorated call me when she got in if she felt the need to or to make a cute design for a 8 year old girl!  What 8 year old wants a bday cake w/ out a fun decoration???? The girl at the counter didn't know what to tell me... She said no one was there to even fix the mistake.  I ended up buying another cake out of the freezer, with a cute design, going to the grocery store and getting the icing to write her name and Happy Birthday on it! We didn't get to have the Oreo flavor we originally ordered.  I would NOT recommend EVER ordering a cake from here if you want it a special way... My poor little girl was almost in tears!!! NOT COOL DQ!!!!"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is by far my favorite soft served ice cream parlors. My family has been going here either every week for a treat or every other week. Prices have been the same and service hasn't really changed. Only downside is long wait times if you are drive thru. Chicken Basket and Blizzards are my favorites here. Never disappointed me thus far"}
{"text":"Disappointed that they don't have footling coneys. The blizzards are good, but I had to go to Sonic to get my coney fix."}
{"text":"This is the second local DQ that I visited and was disappointed in not being able to get a footlong coney. I had to go to Sonic to get my fix."}
{"text":"Just called this DQ for a birthday cake that I need by tomorrow and the girl (Bre) I talked to over the phone was amazing and so helpful! Hoping the cake turns out as wonderful as the service!"}
{"text":"Burgers, shakes, and soft serve ice cream. What's not to like. This isn't a 5 Star Wolfgang Puck restaurant, it's Dairy Queen. Good food at cheap prices. Restaurant could use some updating, but when it's hot, this is the place to take the Kids for some good soft serve ice cream and grab a bacon cheeseburger for dad. What more can we say."}
{"text":"Every time I stop by this location, I hope for better service but that rarely happens unless I decide to come inside the store. The workers in drive thru always cut me off as I'm ordering and are rude most of the time. Usually when I come inside the service is great!"}
{"text":"No chocolate ice cream. It has been down for DAYS. WTF is Dairy Queen without chocolate ice cream. The only reason I gave it to stars was because the guy working the drive-through was very polite."}
{"text":"The ice cream is fabulous but the customer service here is horrible. They are basically trying to push you out the door the whole time you're ordering."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and they move at the speed of a snail and they never have anything available. I'm starting to think they just don't wanna make it or get it for me. Your twist ice cream machine shouldn't be out for multiple months. Come on."}
{"text":"Came here to get a cake for a birthday. We waited thirty minutes to get somebody to write \"happy birthday\" on it. The girl came back out and said the staff messed up our cake. And that they did a terrible job and it looked like a two year olds handwriting. She then looked in the freezer and there was no more of the cake we wanted. She said she was going to go and try to fix the bad writing. She was laughing about it the whole time and I didn't find that funny. If she couldn't get the writing on it in the first place, then don't mess up the entire cake and try to give me a cake that has fingerprints in it and messy writing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have never been a huge fan of this Dairy Queen location but it is the closest one so we just deal with the little problems. Tonight was a last straw though. We showed up at 9:35 and the doors were locked. The hours of operation on the door said open till 10 pm. Closing 25 minutes early are you kidding me?  We decided to try the drive thru since It looked open and to our surprise it was. We both ordered blizzards and took about two minutes to make. That wasn't the problem. The problem was when we got them they were half melted. How can a blizzard melt that fast. I wish I was exaggerating when I say this, but honestly it was like ice cream soup. My boyfriend got the New York strawberry cheese cake and only managed to find one strawberry in it. We used to have issues with just the service but now I can officially say I'm done using this location. It's a shame since they just redid the whole thing but the problem seems to lie in management and staff. That's what really needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"The girls working here are very young. I blame management for not properly supervising them. Watching one of them holding my sundae with one hand and lick the fingers of her other hand was more than I could handle. This was done within sight of another employee who was working on my husband's sundae. They obviously have no clue."}
{"text":"just discovered this DQ today....spotless dining area and other areas in customer view...greated by and order taken by a bearded gentleman who was welcoming and took my order quickly..in between orders, he was training a new employee....he was very patient and thorough with her...my order was ready quickly, fresh and correct...couldnt ask for more. thanks!"}
{"text":"I think I am finally done with Dairy Queen! I couldn't wait to have a waffle dipped ice cream cone. Dairy Queen has totally ruined the experience for me.  Let me ask my Yelp family what they think:   1.  When you order soft served ice-cream in a waffle dipped cone, do you expect to hold it so you can lick the tasty ice-cream while gently nibbling away at the cone? (or something like that :)  Or...    2.  When you order your soft served ice-cream in a waffle dipped cone, do you expect to have it handed to you in a cone shaped cup with a long spoon?   I know strange question right? Well, apparently the latter is the way they serve their waffle ice-cream cones at this Dairy Queen location. I literally took my cone out of it's protective casing and handed it back to the staff member.   I figured out why they have the casing though. The ice cream melts before you get out the door and the waffle cone doesn't hold the melted milk from dripping out of the bottom. In fact the entire cone disintegrates before you can get half way done with the cone.   Check out my friend's cone and casing - he ordered the same thing I did (pictured).  When I buy an ice-cream cone, I expect to hold the cone free of a protective casing. Additionally, when I buy ice-cream, I don't expect to get milk."}
{"text":"I been asked by number of different people to support local area business that impacted by the construction. Today I decided to take my business to Dairy queen which normally the burgers are good but not what I experienced.   The Bread was so soggy that when you bit into it would break apart. Who would wanna eat a burger with a fork.   The onion rings were so burnt and I have had better onion rings from them then this.   I was never thanked for the business or stopping by a lot of local area business are struggling because they have been impacted by the construction... Dairy queen management does not care about the customers feedback or customer visit. Personally if they wanna sell me food that I have to eat with a fork I wont return..."}
{"text":"So I was craving an sundae earlier, I decided to pop by this DQ and got the medium size sundae with strawberry. After paying for the sundae, I was shocked by the size of the sundae, the server said he had weighed out the sundae too, it was as big as the vanilla cone. If you want every want a sundae, don't come here. Its no way as good as the Costco very berry sundae! Hands down!"}
{"text":"We have given this location so many chances and they ALWAYS let us down.  We love dairy queen, but this location just can't do anything right.  Our bad service had been bribed away with free blizzards and such, but it's time for a review on Yelp this time.   My wife just got home with our DQ and I hear what had become the DQ expletive as she opened the box.  Her favorite is the chicken basket with gravy (only with gravy) so she was sure to verify with the over paid drive through person \"the gravy is in there?\"  \"yes it is\"  \"are you sure?\"  \"yes, it's in the box.\"   Nope, not in the box, but at least our dog has a chicken dinner.  He'd give five stars, but he doesn't get to vote."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is the best and the busiest Dairy Queen that I have ever seen. It is even busy in winter. It brings back fond memories of the Dairy Queen's that I visited as a kid many years ago, although this one is better.  Can't give it more than three stars as it is a Dairy Queen after all and I reserve higher rankings for full service sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"Joined their email club and right away got a coupon for $3 off on an ice cream cake.   I've been to this location many times, but not recently. We stopped in and found a log cake that looked really good. They have a freezer with a variety of flavors, sizes and prices. It was hard to choose. They all looked delicious!   The log cake was $14.99, and the manager was nice enough to honor our coupon even though it was for a round cake.  Will be back for ice cream when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"I would've given no stars if I had the choice.  It was my kid's birthday and just so happens we received a coupon for $3 off their ice cream cakes over $35.  I opened up the coupon from the email from my phone to see what the coupon was about but then after I opened it once it gave a message to tell me that it's no longer available because I've printed it.  I went to the store to explain the situation but they would not care at all.  They inquired with the manager at the back and the manager, Linda, did not even bother to come out to speak to me.  It's not about the $3, I couldn't care less.  It is the principle.  If your system is set up to allow customers to only be able to open the coupon once then first of all give a warning.  Secondly, the email did not even mention what the coupon was about so one has to open the coupon to see what it is.  Will go baskin robins for my ice cream cake instead."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm a DQ regular and I gotta tell you..this one is spotless! Even the bathrooms sparkle. The workers are real pros too. real fast service"}
{"text":"Not every Dairy Queen is created equal.  Many Dairy Queen's no longer have cherries which makes getting a chocolate covered cherry blizzard impossible to get.  This Dairy Queen not only has cherries, but the staff goes out of their way to make it correctly.  I highly recommend this DQ."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite things about Dairy Queen is the Chocolate Covered Cherry Blizzard.  I was traveling through Phoenix looking for a place to have dinner, so I stopped and came in. I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo and then decide to treat myself with a chocolate covered cherry blizzard.  However, I was told they no longer do anything cherry.  I was extremely disappointed, since they also have Coke products.  Blizzards without cherries are just not the same."}
{"text":"Love this dairy queen location they always get my orders right and I love there blizzards and they always are top notch when it comes to service and customer service."}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest DQ I have ever seen. With that being said the appearance of the store also matched the quality of the food and the service. Even late on Sunday nights this place is busy yet still executes each order perfectly with a smile on their face. So weather you want something sweet or a real meal to eat this place will not disappoint.  I really like that they offer smaller sizes for the Blizzards now because although they are good it can get a bit rich. The drive through seems chaotic and is constantly long, I would reccomend going inside to order or realxing and eating in like I do."}
{"text":"We love this Dairy Queen. The staff is friendly and the food is great and affordable."}
{"text":"Came here to eat lunch. It's your standard hot dog stand. Lol! They only have hot dogs, Pepsi products to drink, smoothies & desserts. Food is okay. Chili cheese dogs were so good. So much cheese on my chili dog!  This is located on the first floor of the Excalibur hotel. There's also a game room in front of Dairy Queen. It's a great place for kids to play at.  There are about 5 tables on the side of Dairy Queen. There's plenty of room to move around. Not too many people here which is great.  The lady was handing out free samples of a berry smoothie. It consisted of blackberries, strawberries, blueberries and yogurt. Tasted delicious. Very berry! Very smooth consistency.  My daughter loves the Excalibur because to her it looks like a princess castle. We will be back. Descent place."}
{"text":"One of the best Dairy Queens I've been to.  Very clean,   friendly staff. ... We had Pumpkin pie blizzards.  Yum!"}
{"text":"After seeing a commercial profiling what appeared to be a glorious waffle cone containing the blizzard confetti cake , DQ weighed heavy on our mind.  Finding an appropriate window after to dinner, we were off to experience what the television had shown up.  While waiting in line...I started reading reviews..no way it could be that bad???? Then it came time to place our order.  If I want teenage attitude, I can stay at home and get it along sub-mediocre service FOR FREE!  We hung in there and I feel won over our server because eventually he at least smiled.  With that it bumps the review up a star.  But other than than that, my little dollop of ice-cream left me wanting  so much more."}
{"text":"Amazing oreo s'more blizzard according to my husband. I went with the basic as always Reese's blizzard bomb.com. Oh & they have a drive thru big plus."}
{"text":"Worst DQ I've ever been to. Dirty, horribly slow service...and say WHAT?!?!...they only have vanilla?!?!?! Somebody needs to rescue this DQ. Very runned down."}
{"text":"Ah, my old diabetes-giving food coma inducing friend. We meet again ;)  Solid service, solid prices, solid taste, literally NO place to sit down though. Typical Dairy Queen with a lot of staff for a surprisingly quick service."}
{"text":"Extremely unfriendly cashier at the drive through.  Messed up my order after repeating it correctly.  Got annoyed when I asked to have it fixed.  \"Fixed\" order was completely wrong as well.  Only go here if you want to be treated rudely by the staff and get whatever random items they decide to give you instead of your actual order."}
{"text":"Blizzard of the month is usually really good.  Try the Pumpkin Pie this month.  Service at the drive thru is usually very slow."}
{"text":"Sierra made my experience here feel special. She offered amazing customer service and smiled the whole time. I hope you go far in life Sierra, with your kind spirit I have a feeling you will. Good job DQ for hiring and training an amazing person."}
{"text":"Love this old school Dairy Queen! They always hook my dogs up with milk bones in the drive thru. Just be patient with the drive thru speaker. It's old; speak slowly and clearly. :-)"}
{"text":"my very first visit here, just a few days ago, was great. a very pleasant woman took my order, and worked the window, she was wonderful. and the small cookie dough blizzard i ordered was so good!  some good chunks of dough. not skimpy at all.   **triggered my desire for another.**  unfortunately my second visit wasn't as great, which just took place earlier this evening.  the gentleman who took my order was pleasant also. i was super excited...til i wasn't   the quality of my cookie dough blizzard (ordered with extra dough this time) was lacking...extremely...i was so dissatisfied and disappointed after only getting 5 (at best) very small little bits of cookie dough out of a whole MEDIUM cup of ice cream. melty ice cream at that.  **coaching moment for employees** just take the time to read the order.  the whole order. not just the first part.  i order extra for a reason. k thanks!  might try again in a couple months."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dairy Queen I've been to. They won't honor mobile coupons or offers and I've even had problems with actual copies. Tonight is my last visit to this location for sure. Burgers sloppily put together so much mustard and ketchup it was gross! Stale fries and my peanut buster parfait barely had any fudge. I'll drive to the one off baseline and higley from now on. Waste of $30."}
{"text":"Great place to get ice cream on a hot summer evening!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place where you can NOT have soft serve chocolate ice cream then this is the place for you. Especially if you want to get out of your car to not get chocolate ice cream due to its non existent drive through. However, because I don't even like chocolate and it is open later than most dairy queens i will be generous with my rating. I give this establishment a solid three stars. Check please."}
{"text":"I love this Dairy Queen location. It is located very conveniently on central and you can pull in right off the road and grab whatever ails the old sweet tooth. As far as frozen treats go they are also have excellent prices. Service is always spot on and since there is almost always people waiting in line here the staff is good about getting your order and payment done quickly so you can get to your tasty treat asap. The only critique I would have is that over the past couple years it seems like a few of their portion sizes have gone down with prices remaining about the same. All in all, that's maybe not such a bad thing haha"}
{"text":"If i could give 1 star i would. What kind of a place closes there kitchen 10 minutes early ??  Especially when there was still 15 minutes till they close. Sorry but the ones in Texas we're NOT like this. I hope your management gets it together and realize there loosing $$ out here doing that. Just ridiculous."}
{"text":"We have been to this location frequently and for the most part the service has been good. Typical Dairy Queen. Great place for a treat. The problem I have had is two of the last three times we have been here for blizzards they have tasted like chemicals. The first time I thought it was me. The second time my wife called and was told a) the ice cream had gone bad or b) the blizzard machines hadn't been cleaned all the way. They were wiling to replace our order, which is fine but that means another trip out. I'll give them another shot, but there are other options in the area. I like the convenience of the drive thru, but If the quality is going to be like this it may not be worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times now.  The first 2 times we waited in a long line to be told their ice cream machines were down.  I guess the third time was the charm.  We finally got a Blizzard.  We almost didn't come here for fear of wasting our time again.   Hope the problem has been solved."}
{"text":"Stopped by to order a banana split, since they're having a discount on them. Great service, very friendly, but a tad bit on the slow side. Having one person doing everything is not a good strategy."}
{"text":"Black girl working the drive-through is a F-ing moron. Is she high??? It took three times for her to get my order. After I would tell her what I wanted she would repeat back to me something completely different. The fourth time other girl came on and took my order. They still got it wrong. The girl working the drive-through gave me french fries which I did not order. I ordered three blizzards. Two Oreo blizzards and one tropical blizzard. Not that difficult of an order. Where they got fries from I do not know! I asked for a refund after I paid cash and the girl told me no she couldn't refund me. Ummmm yes you can I just paid you cash! So my blizzards arrive and I drive away and take a bite of mine. WRONG! She gave me bananas and pecans??? I ordered a tropical which has bananas and pineapple-no more coconut. There seriously something wrong with the black girl working the drive-through. She didn't even smile just looked at me with this blank stare completely out of it. Was watching her through the window as she was getting the order ready and she was moving so slowly as if in another world. I would drug test her. Yup, her career is not gonna go further than Dairy Queen drive-through. This DQ customer service sucks."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Dairy Queen for eight years now for all our family birthday cakes. That's four cakes a year, it works out to 32 cake from this place. So that makes me an expert on reviewing this store. First off when you walk in, I alway notice how clean it is. Second the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Third the cakes are very good. I like how light tasting the ice cream is and the price is reasonable. It's a five star rating for me"}
{"text":"Glad to have a DQ in the area so I can get a Chocolate Dip Cone once in awhile. Drive through line was quick and accurate for being brand new."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went for a sundae, nothing shocking. On the menu they had $3 sundaes or 2 for $4 sundaes.. and of course i'm taking the deal. I order, pull up to the window, and the kid goes \"we don't have that deal anymore\" and of course i say \"its on the board?\" Turns out it ended and it should've been taken down. I'm irritated, but I only wanted one to begin with so whatever. Then my total comes out to $5.70! I'm like \"Wait it said it was $3?\" And the guy goes \"Well yeah..but you wanted whipped cream and nuts...\" $2 for whipped cream and nuts. I didn't expect strip prices. A can of whipped cream costs that much. And I thought that was pretty standard on a sundae. I wouldn't have been so irritated if it wasn't for the previous debacle with the special. This place isn't the worst but there are far better ice cream shops in Vegas that know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Beware: the incompetence at this DQ is high. They were unable to hear my order in the mic and when we were talking to them face to face. I'm not sure if they could comprehend English because each of our orders were wrong. My blizzard was disgusting. I asked for a regular small Oreo blizzard and they gave me a sloppy, melted gross fudge Oreo blizzard. I'd take a photo, but it would gross you out."}
{"text":"We had our end-of-the-year flag football party with kids and parents here at Dairy Queen. The staff was awesome ice cream was great as usual and we ended up getting  free ice cream cake and free kids meals which was incredible and super awesome. I would highly recommend this DQ. It's definitely one of the best ones I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This is the slowest service EVER! Not impressed one bit. We have been in line for 20 min and we were the 3rd car."}
{"text":"Young kids working and they are not the brightest tools in the shed. June 7th was National Chocolate Ice Cream Day and kids cones were $.48. I ordered 3 cones and the cashier couldn't figure total. After he asked another employee, neither one could figure the total. Here is my receipt after me saying \"forget it, I'll just pay what you can figure out\"."}
{"text":"Been going to this particular DQ for many years. Could use a face lift, every table and door handle in the place is sticky...but it IS an ice cream place frequented by lots of the younger crowd. LOVE those shakes, malts and Blizzards!"}
{"text":"Excepting a mess I was treated to a Devine intervention of cleanliness friendly smiles and solitude. Food is good. Paves is clean. No sidewalks connecting the business to other locals."}
{"text":"Driving to Flagstaff and my kids wanted Dairy Queen. We stopped here and as we walked in I was impressed how how clean the establishment was, and yes even the bathrooms. Customer service was great. Sade was friendly and attentive. Food was hot and fresh. Totally recommended this place to anyone who loves DQ."}
{"text":"Yikes...absolutely horrifying. Aside from whomever \"Server 122\" is, the rest of the staff was r-u-d-e. Couldn't believe how slow the orders were taking to fill. Customers asking for ketchup or sauce were treated like they were asking for a million dollars. The attitude, (lack of) cleanliness, and general awful atmosphere needs a hard check, and STAT."}
{"text":"Best DQ ever!  Always clean, the staff is super friendly, and the owners actually take pride in their business.  Plus, the ice cream cakes are BOMB."}
{"text":"The ice cream here is awesome, seriously it is a must try!! Also Great service, very nice and polite employees. And last but not least the best Oreo blizzards around!! Or if you want to try something outside the box, their personalized cakes are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Gentleman who was working today 5-15-18 was extremely kind and helpful! My son ordered a dipped cone but the chocolate was too hot. He tried three times, but couldn't get the chocolate to stick. He ended up giving my son a different dessert! He was very helpful, and I appreciate his hard work!"}
{"text":"Drive thru packed inside dead for third time . Kept giving chances before writing review .  Sat and watched them do multiple orders at drive thru and just ignore us in line . Finally I said do we need to go in the drive thru to get served and lady just will be with you in a minute . Complete attitude . Never coming here again everyone always in a bad mood ."}
{"text":"Just stood in line for nearly 10 minuets, while three employees worked in the drive through order. Not one person acknowledged us. Then then one girl had her hair down and not pulled back. The other one had a long pony tail with hair flying everywhere. The last one just stood there taking directions from the other two. I really wanted ice cream, but not with hair flying around and not being acknowledged. I wouldn't even give this place one star if I didn't have to rate it."}
{"text":"Best DQ there is in town. The employes are always nice, and the food comes out fast! Will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Been a DQ Blizzard fan for a number of years now - still love it when they would just turn the cup upside down and the ice cream will neither melt nor fall ! Perfect every time !  I love the sizes - I always have ice cream after a big meal so the Mini suits me just fine ! The heath blizzard is one of my favs and so is the soft serve - no vanilla is better than the DQ vanilla !"}
{"text":"4.85/5 -0.15 pt. : difficult drive thru navigation  Orange Julius... Heck any Julius... And the blizzard test... Never a bad time for either... That is all"}
{"text":"I paid $7.39 for a small dipped cone and a bottled water. I understand that a \"treat-only\" DQ has to make ends meet in winter, but this is far too expensive."}
{"text":"Out in the area for ice cream- we are loyal yelpers and saw these reviews and thought \"it's Dairy Queen, could it really be that bad?\" It 100% was. The inside of this establishment is DISGUSTING! We ordered a milkshake and a dipped cone- couldn't imagine that was difficult to mess up. The cone came from behind the counter covered in napkins because it was a sloppy, melted mess. Didn't look anything like what they look like from any other DQ we've been to. We will not be back. We agree with fellow yelp users- close this place. Totally surprised they have even achieved 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Loving their $5 Buck lunch which includes the entrée of your choice: chillicheese dog or chicken straps or grilled burger with cheese  Drink and a sundae Can't go wrong with that! :)"}
{"text":"Went here last week and the guy working the drive through was awesome! We always have liked going to this location since its close to the Mesa Temple (a nice spot to walk that ice cream off) but now we love it even more!   Only draw back is that it is in the middle of construction so it's really hard to get to."}
{"text":"Ice cream is ok, stay away from anything else.  Chicken over cooked, burger super dry.  Chicken wraps pretty bad also. Stay away."}
{"text":"I ordered the $5 lunch special at Dairy Queen. The chicken fingers and fries were fine, the best part was the ice cream sundae that is included. The dining area is clean but the bathroom had a foul odor in there. Smelt a bit like sewage. Also, about 7 or 8 fruit flies would not stop circling me during my meal. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Tonight stopped in for 2 pumpkin pie blizzards, and had to throw them in the garbage, they were like milk, melted and leaked all over, and were not mixed properly. This is not the first time this has happened at this location. It seems they don't keep the ice cream cold enough. Been visiting Dairy Queen locations for years, and was excited when this one opened close to home, but I'd rather drive to Plaza Midwood, where I know I'm gunna get the quality of ice cream Dairy Queen is know for."}
{"text":"Store hours clearly state 9:00 pm close time. Doors locked and turning people away before 8:30."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see there was a DQ in walking distance to my house.. I absolutely LOVE the OJ original and could drink them daily. Went in to find a young blonde girl working the register. No a smile not a hello. Nothing. She looked absolutely miserable. When she did finally speak to tell me my total I couldn't hear her, she was practically whispering.  To make matters worse my drink tasted like I sprayed perfume in my mouth and couldn't get it out.. horrible!"}
{"text":"After waiting 40 minutes we finally got our order. I actually think we were in the drive thru line longer than that, but i am trying to be generous. The person at the window starts handing the items to my husband one at a time, when he asked for a bag, the kid said you want a bag? He closed the window after a few minutes a girl gave my husband rhe stuff in the bag. Um yes a bag... they handed him the wrong blizzard, then he gave it back they gave him the right one. I would not have waited this long in line except once u get in line u cannot get out because the drive thru is so narrow u cannot go around. Ps they did not hold his blizzard upside down so I'm sure it is a melted mess. Almost home so we will know soon."}
{"text":"Not big on chain restaurants but this location had the nicest staff and the girl who made my salted caramel blizzard made it better than anywhere else i've tried, soo good, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this DQ, they have the friendliest and most efficient staff!  We have been coming here for years. There are 2 other DQ's near me and this one requires me to drive through downtown Gilbert but I will keep doing it for the great service!"}
{"text":"Their brownie batter blizzards are my favorite still. As a kid I would get their ice cream sandwiches. Their prices are okay, I always use the coupons from the mail. Their fries are pretty good, the wraps are good too."}
{"text":"I Love the Blizzards!!!!! Best thing ever!!!!! They always have a line here because it's the closest one on this town. But definetly worth the wait especially on a hot day like always."}
{"text":"Still my favourite Dairy Queen. I had a strawberry sundae, the ice cream was velvety smooth, creamy and not too sweet and strawberries added made it the perfect treat for such a beautiful day. Server was friendly, efficient and courteous."}
{"text":"I was so impressed.with the team at the store on Gilbert Rd. I was asking about a new product and before I knew it he almost sold me every new flavor! I had to ask his name because this young man is going to go far. Thank you Hayden for offering the best service I have had at dairy queen yet. He is a company stand out. Also a shout out for Derek. Excellent job Gilbert Dairy Queen :-) :-) Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my first 1 star rating!  :(   I figured I would give this DQ/Orange Julius (both inside this location) near my work a shot. DQ in general must be the most overpriced place to go for fast-food considering the quality and quantity you receive (aside from the blizzards).  Jennifer T. is right about the fact that this specific location has a limited meal selection...I was hoping for a burger and ended up with a sandwich the size of the palm of my hand. To top it off I was charged for a large Orange Julius fruit Smoothy instead of a medium, and there was hardly any fruit in it, so it tasted like the syrupy orange sorbet base and not berries.  Although, I should note the server was friendly and the place was very clean. Unfortunately, I came for food and not the ambiance.  The highlight was the piece of bacon on my meager club sandwich.  I got a crappy smoothy and a tiny sandwich for ten dollars; I will not be back here ever."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make: I'm a bit of a blizzard whore.  I don't know when it happened or how, but I do know that I can't avoid it. I LOOOOOOOVE Dairy Queen blizzards. I'm not just talkin' now and then kinda thing, I'm talkin' if I could have them every single day for the rest of my life without them going straight to my hips, I would.  I used to work next door to this Dairy Queen, so I can tell you honestly that the service at this particular location is better than most. The staff is great and boy can they mix a mean blizzard.   I've experimented quite a bit with different blizzard flavours, but it's time I let you in on the secret recipe of the ULTIMATE blizzard combo. Once you go this type of blizzard, you will NEVER go back. Trust me.  Order a medium (or large hehehehhe) oreo cookie blizzard and then ask them to mix in Reese Peanut Butter Cups. NOT the Reese Peanut Butter Pieces, but the CUPS. OH MY GOD. If they could manufacture sex in a cup, it would be this.   Every bite is filled with delicious oreo cookie pieces, followed by the unmistakable taste of Reese Peanut Butter Cups. I love chocolate and I love peanut butter, so the mix between the two takes me to unspeakable places.  If you've never tried this mix, please, do it for me. It's the greatest and cheapest high you can get and the best part is that it's completely legal. So go ahead - get high by the spoonful and don't say I didn't warn you: SEX. IN. A. CUP."}
{"text":"At around 8 i wanted to go get some ice cream with my bros. So we all settled on going to Dairy Queen. I was like alright cool and we went. The food was good and came fast but the whole time we were there i didn't realize there were american idol try outs because these two broads working kept singing loudly knowing there were people here eating. If i wanted to hear a bad cover of Whitney Houston's \"I will always Love You\" is head to harlem but guess what it's Dairy Queen. Tell your employees to stop singing."}
{"text":"The only thing better than visiting this Dairy Queen would be to live in the condo right beside it. Iit has the usual fried favourites on the DQ grill side and the frozen treats on the other, but sets this quaint standalone location apart from any other fast food spot is the view! Overlooking the lush Don Valley in the summer, or the scraggly thorn pit in the winter, the view is unquestionably tops for a relaxed time with some fries and ice cream. There are even National Park quality picnic tables behind the building so you can enjoy the view while you eat. In fact, it's a stellar date spot. Open until 10 pm every night, you don't even need to plan it out, just head over from downtown on Pottery Road off the Bayview extension and you're there. One of you can order fries and the other can get a chocolate Sundae. Have fun dipping those fries into the soft-serve deliciousness. I think my face just turned red, oops! Mmmmmmmm it doesn't get more decadent than that!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service hands down. Rude staff. Also this is the \"kids meal\", went drive thru and they didn't give me the ice cream that goes with it too."}
{"text":"Small but cozy location, had a chicken wrap and onion rings along with a chocolate shake. All the employees were super nice, place was clean and even the manager came out during our meal and asked if we needed anything and checked on the food taste and quality. That kind of service means a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Came to this location to order a strawberry cheesecake ice cream cake. Ordered it at 3:01. Alexis originally told me it could be ready at 5. Right before leaving the store, she said her manager asked if I could pick up at 7 instead \"to make sure it would be done on time\". I walked into the store at 7:00. I told the front guy I was here to pick up a cake and showed him my receipt. About 2 mins later, I saw him say no cake to someone else. At 7:12, I asked what the hold up was as I was there to simply pick up a cake and no one had thought to acknowledge me again. At 7:14, the \"manager\" (young kid), cake out and said the cake was not made and he was making it now and it would take an additional 10mins. I continued to wait. About 10mins later the \"manager\" came out and asked if I could just purchase an already made cake because he didn't know how to make an ice cream cake. I refused because there was no \"already made strawberry cheesecake cake\" and because I had already waited almost 30mins for a cake that I was told was being made! He proceeded to tell me that the cake was \"made\" but he couldn't decorate it! I demanded a discount and the non-decorated strawberry cheesecake cake. He gave me a discount at the register and went back to the back again. Another 13mins went by so I asked another employee to ask him what the hold up was since he said the cake was already made. After waiting a total of 45mins, I finally received a melting ice cream cake. The manager attempted to \"decorate\" the cake and didn't do a bad job but the fact that they had 4hrs to make my cake and did not start making it until I walked in and didn't care to acknowledge me because they knew they screwed up was very unprofessional and demonstrated poor service on their part. I'm glad I didn't order this cake for a party! I will NEVER come to this immature, kid ran location again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Putting your tip JUG on top of and COVERING the slot of the Children's Miracle Network donation box? You should be ashamed of yourselves. Please tell me why you deserve the change more than sick/dying children? Super slow service to boot so not sure why that jug is even there."}
{"text":"I loved DQ as a kid and practically lived there as a teenager.  Fast forward many years and I am now rediscovering the joy of their soft serve.  I am an ice cream fiend and DQ's vanilla cones just seem to hit the spot these days.  Something about the cold, creamy goodness is deeply satisfying, and is rivaled only by their chocolate sundae.  This location has been here forever and has been upgraded.  The staff is very polite and the drive-thru is usually busy.  Most times this deliciousness is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"When it comes to service this Dairy Queen is the worst.  It's always dirty and there's never a manager on duty.  If there's a spill it stays on the floor and doesn't get cleaned up.  The gal came out with our food and a little girl ran in front of her.  The gal spilled our drinks but didn't replace it.  We had to go back up and ask for it and she also forgot my daughter's smoothie."}
{"text":"Normally I go to the Dairy Queen  on Rancho but today I decided to go to the one by my house. When I walked in there was a blonde short girl who is very creepy she didn't even say hello or I'll be right with you she just stared. When I approached the counter she never asked me how could I help you today  . She just stared . It made me feel uncomfortable so I left . Overall I wasn't greeted or helped ."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this dairy Queen for more than 10 years. It was a walk up the block from my house as a kid and I still come to this one now. As a kid this place had great service. The food is great and their blizzards are the best. I always get my birthday cake from here every year. However, this past few years the customer service is sub par. Every single time, yes every single time, I've gone in the workers are never enthusiastic, never seem to care about what they're  doing, don't say thank you, don't greet you when you walk in, and are expressionless. You'd think they were prison workers or something and even then they'd probably be thrilled to be there. Love this place but the service needs serious work."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice in the past month and each time they mess up our order. Either they put two pieces of nuts I. A whole large ice cream or completely don't put in any item at all! I won't be coming to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Worst DQ on west side. Lines move so much faster at Rocky River and North Ridgeville stores"}
{"text":"it's in a bad location in Chandler. Long wait and the quality is not good. Place is dirty and stinky. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"This place is super slow.  I'd go elsewhere if i were you.  The food is iffy at times too. They need to his more for the summer."}
{"text":"This was not the best dq experience.  My husband ordered 2 blizzards and they were both wrong.  How do you mix up butterfinger for reese cup? And the didnt even blend them.  Had to mix them on our own when he returned doubt i will go again.  I guess this is the reason why the line at Brusters was so long."}
{"text":"A franchise that is ready for a turn around.  Bad service and bathroom that is outside and they wouldn't give me a key to use it.  Bad bad bad."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for 5-6 months. I've only had one minor issue, nothing to even mention. Most of the employees make everything perfect and don't make mistakes. The only issue I have is there prices are higher than the other local locations I've gone to. That's the part that pisses me off. Especially going there most everyday!!!! I've never ever been offered anything extra either for loyalty. When living in other neighborhoods in Vegas and Henderson, the owners or managers always throw in a free blizzard once a month, or a free box of Buster Bars, not here, they raise the prices. That's one thing that will make me change in the next couple weeks if I don't see any return at all for being loyal."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger ever - made with mayo, chili, slaw on toast!  You will thank me!   Local favorite!"}
{"text":"Been awhile since our last visit. Just got reminded why.. Blizzards are like eating cups of plain ice cream. Very skimpy on toppings. Value for your money is what any customer is looking for. Shame on you for cheating your customers out of what they pay for."}
{"text":"Average small town franchise. The food is okay quality but a great value. Ice cream is delicious, of course. Love the cotton candy blizzard, and they have kept it year round. The facility was recently remodeled. Although the employees are friendly, they could be cleaner. Aprons that can be changed if they get blizzards splattered on them, would be a good option."}
{"text":"Stopped in for sundaes last night - very tasty! Quick service through the drive through and under $6 for the two of us.   I wish a DQ was closer to my work. Their lunch specials can't be beat - $5 for a meal with drink and a sundae!"}
{"text":"Don't plan to eat here because they have very little seating, but if you want a Blizzard, a Dilly Bar, a soft serve cone, or an Orange Julius to ward off the triple digit heat of a Scottsdale summer, this is a good place to go.  If you want a gelato pr a frozen yogurt, you're in the wrong place."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience for me! Chicken wrap had a wierd taste, which prompt me to look inside, where I found wilted lettuce. The banana looked suspect as well, but only had slight browning on the inside. My meal was ruined, but the ice cream cone was granted the 2 stars."}
{"text":"I experienced symptoms suggesting food poisoning after eating here. It was the only thing I had eaten differently than my friend that day and my friend did not experience the same symptoms. It was the worst bout of food poisoning that I have ever experienced. I contacted DQ to report my illness and inquire whether they had gotten any other reports. I did not receive any follow-up from the restaurant so, one week later, I attempted contact again. I then received a voicemail from a man calling from a blocked/unavailable number claiming that he had his daughter call me after my initial report but I never received said call."}
{"text":"Ok so me and my son went, and some long haired  Indian fool gave me a bunch of attitude about using  The bathroom, We had just finished some yard work and  Wanted to wash up before we ordered but the kid made a  Big deal out of ordering first. Never again."}
{"text":"I am very patient with fast food. I ordered one large #4 and one 1/4 cheeseburger. I was the only one in drive through, everything on my receipt was correct. First I was given the wrong size fries. Then I was given a completely different burger, even though the correct one is on my receipt. After they give me the correct one, I left and took a bite. It was completely RAW. ONLY the very outside layer was cooked, they weren't even busy. I can understand rushes and mistakes, but this was one right after the other when there was no rush. They even put someone's health at risk for serving undercooked meat. Never eating at this location again."}
{"text":"Love DQ's ice cream. This location is very busy."}
{"text":"After a bday dinner we stopped by for a treat.  Before ordering, we clearly stated our daughter has a peanut allergy, and requested her item (oreo blizzard) be made aside from others, on clean equipment.  This has never been an issue in the past.  We ordered 5 items, waited in the drive thru for more than 10 minutes, and when we finally got our order, the cashier was rude when I asked her which blizzard was which.  I asked for napkins, and she closed the window.  In shock over the way she treated us, we drove off.  A few minutes later my daughter said her blizzard tasted funny, then she she felt funny like her throat was closing.  Her lips and face began to swell, so we headed to the emergency room.  Upon inspecting her blizzard, we found out it had chunks of butterfingers in it.  We were given the wrong order! I called the store the next day, and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager said they would have the owner call me.  After several phone messages, and many weeks later the owner finally called me. He said he didn't believe me, and would not give us his insurance information so they could pay our ER bill.  He flat out refused.   Needless to say,  we have told all of our friends and family about this place and the owner's shady actions.  We will never,  ever go to this place again.  I'm also contacting the better business Bureau."}
{"text":"Summer is approaching and you know what that means?!?!? It's almost Blizzard season!  Yes, I'll admit it: Blizzards are one of my most cherished ice cream treats. Blended to perfection with the tastiest toppings of your choice, there is nothing that satisfies quite like a Blizzard.  This Dairy Queen is a personal favourite of mine because the service is good and the location is perfect. Located right across the street from Crowfoot Plaza, you can grab some ice cream goodness and then spend the day walking around the plaza. Or you could reverse things up a bit and see a movie, and then walk over for some dessert!  This place also carries delish ice cream cakes and they hooked me up recently with the most perfect birthday cake for my cousin.  Great service, fantastic location, and life altering dessert (am I being melodramatic???)!  God I love DQ."}
{"text":"A quick treat...  yes please! I was in the mood for just a little bit of ice cream.  Dairy Queen was on the way home and it had been a while since my last visit.  The inside has totally been redone.  It looks great!  Very clean with new booths and tables.  Plus they have a child area with a little table and activities.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They seem to do a good job with getting orders out quickly.  There was only one person in front of me so it didn't take long for my order to be completed.   I tried their new Peanut Butter Cup blizzard.  A small one is always more than enough for me.  It's creamy and plenty of the topping mixed in.  Sometimes that's all I need for my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.  2nd time I have been there this week.  Will not return to this location.   Lady working the counter has huge attitude and hates her job.  Pretty sure she threw the fry sauce at me when she attempted to set it on the table.  Place needs a staff make over.  Someone here who enjoys their job and will smile."}
{"text":"At 9:30pm we were flagged down by a worker outside asking us as we pulled in if we planned to order. Uhm yes but only ice cream I explained  to which i was met with \"*tisk* well you know that we close in 30 minutes right, I mean I want you have have the best ice cream available but we've already started to close up and *tisk* ya know....\" After as long awkward pause I said forget it and left...  I don't know what they may have done to my food had I ordered.  Why was she outside basically shoo'ing people away?!?!. Last time I went about a month ago, and SAME thing! Only at 9:15! And the time before that I me 5th with a dark and closed restaurant at 8:59...no note on door nothing. Y'all have OFFICIALLY  lost my business."}
{"text":"Yeah, it was okay...just like store bought ice cream to me.  Maybe I am super spoiled by another ice cream place (ahem...Cold Stone) but I really don't see myself going back there. Oh I forgot, I also ordered a hot dog from there and I don't know if I was tripping but it was kind of slimy (if that's the right word for it lol).  Just didn't like it at all."}
{"text":"They told me they couldn't make oreo shakes here. I've never been to a dairy queen that has said this. You put milk, Oreos, and vanilla ice cream. Then blend. Lost business from me and I'm sure many many other customers!!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely dedicated to the Blizzard treat.  I saw an ad on TV for the Triple Chocoholic Blizzard (while I was working out, of all times), and I couldn't get it out of my mind.  I went in and ordered the small size (to ease my guilty conscience)...and I daresay it lived up to its expectations.  Yum.  I'm glad it's only a flavor of the month, otherwise I'd be coming back here for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"I'll definitely be coming back for sure!! Service was excellent, quick & efficient! Had my whole crew of nieces & nephews with us and still had a great time!! Luv the new gal with the huge smile!! Thank you DQ!"}
{"text":"I happened to be craving ice cream in this day and thought, I haven't had Dairy Queen in a while so... I went to google and found one close by. As I was walking in the sign said \"customer appreciation day, everything half price. Good day to visit a good ice cream shop!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I am old.  When I was growing up, Dairy Queen, A&W, Taco Bell (back in the 60's in El Paso) and Shakey's Pizza were the common \"fast food\" places to eat.  I always loved Dairy Queen, and decided to take my family there because they were advertising 5 buck lunches from 11am to 4pm.  This location did not disappoint.  It is very, very clean.  The service is really great.  And the 5 buck lunch is a \"heck of a deal\".  I would easily come back again, and again.  By the way, my favorite fries are McD's when they are piping hot.  I found the Dairy Queen Fries to be as good or better, IMO."}
{"text":"Manager is extremely rude and talks down to her employees in front of customers. Today I was refused service because the lady with too much eyeliner on decided to tell me what I wanted instead of listening to my order. She then proceeded to roll her eyes at me, which I asked why are you rolling your eyes at me, she stated because I didn't know what I was ordering. It's ice cream, not rocket science. I usually go thru the drive thru and the older lady who takes my order is awesome. Also, don't put all your chairs on the table so no one can sit. Especially if your not even close to closing. I suggest that you put a few of your employees in a customer service training class so they know how to treat people. With all the other reviews I've read from here, seems like they don't care on how this business is ran. What a shame DQ, what a shame."}
{"text":"We had a very poor experience at this Mahomet Dairy Queen. It took us almost 50 minutes in the drive thru, with 3 cars in front of us. When we finally reached the window we found out why it took so long. One woman was taking orders via the drive thru & making the ice cream orders, and there were THREE employees behind her, standing around, not helping her, not doing anything. One girl literally had her arms crossed. Why were these three individuals there, when it was one person doing everything? We love Dairy Queen, but we were highly disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"For me....DQ is Sweet nostalgia....  This location is a little different than what I'm used to since it's a walk up only but the menu offers all your favorites like blizzards, sundaes and milkshakes.   I ordered a Peanut Buster Parfait. It's basically creamy ice cream topped with peanuts and hot fudge. It was just as good as I remember....but I will warn you they leave the shells on the peanuts so if that's not your thing you may want to opt for a different treat!   I agree with other reviews I wish they had more seating but overall if you're looking for a sweet treat this summer...this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"We happened to be driving by and it sounded like the perfect afternoon treat!  It wasn't busy at that point of the day.  I was able to walk right up and order.  They were smiling and so friendly.  Great service and were very quick to make my order.    The s'mores blizzard was definitely good.  It was really jammed packed with the ingredients of chocolate and graham crackers.  I see myself getting this again.    The store itself needed a little updating and tlc.  It wasn't the cleanest establishment so I was glad to get this to go.    I'm never opposed to stoping for DQ! It's an old favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible I went here for lunch it took 10 minutes to order the guy told me the fryer was broke no food I asked for a orange Julius he said our machine is broke I asked what do u have he said just ice cream waisted my lunch time"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience at this location! I will never go to this location again due to the customer service! The workers here need to realize they have a job here because of the customers! I repeated my order 3 times to the boy at the drive through. After the third time he said just come to the window. I then repeated it again and he still got it wrong! So I patiently waited and asked him to put the stuff he already gave me back in the freezer so it wouldn't melt as it was still 90 something degrees out. He only put some of the order away and left the rest out while he remade the blizzards. He was very apologetic which I was fine with. He finally gave me the new blizzards; however totally made one of them just a little more than half way! He totally half a**ed it! I said to him just because you got the order wrong doesn't mean you cheap us out on what we're paying for! I asked to speak to the manager. A very messy trashy looking young woman came to the window and immediately had an attitude! At first I thought this is what they have representing there store?!?! She looks very homeless like and dirty! I told her what had happened and she said well what do you want me to do about it? I said I just wanted to let you know and she still had major attitude so I asked for her bosses info and at first she was reluctant to give it to me. So I had to repeat my self with this trashy woman. She then said you need to wait I don't know the owners info... I said never mind... (There was already 9 cars behind me I didn't want to have them suffer any longer due to the laziness and lack of common sense from the teens working in here)! So as I was leaving the homeless looking like manager slammed the window closed infront of me and my son! I'm surprised it did not break! This company is really screwed up having someone like her representing them! I would rather go to the location on Peoria then deal with these idiots! We go to DQ every Saturday evening...so looks like we'll be spending our $ there! I then told my son this is why you go to school so you don't end up working behind a counter like those idiots! As we got home my son was eating his blizzard and it was wrong! How hard is it to get an order correct?!?!"}
{"text":"Nice DQ! Stop here a lot when we have a taste for a \"nightcap.\" But, don't bother with the hot dogs. I had a chili cheese dog the other night and it was probably the poorest excuse for a hot dog I have had in my life. It was like a blown up cocktail weeny that someone dumped some canned chili on with a little cheese Whiz. Not impressed by the food... Always good service and Blizzards though."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Dairy Queen a handful of times and get a freakin cherry misty with a \"dollop\" of vanilla ice cream every time and it's pretty stellar every time, the service is eh but the misty is bomb. But today this very Shit mood of an employee made my drink with so much ice cream. And my misty was watery. She clearly sees that I'm not satisfied and does nothing about it. So I wait in the drive through for someone to assist me because again I'm \"clearly\" not happy. She then proceeds to tell me \" you are literally the only person to complain about this drink\". I'm sorry but no one has every made it that gross. I give suburb service 60 hours a week with what I do. Make the freakin misty again, smile and say I'm so sorry. Come on girl. You might be unhappy but don't ruin my experience. Shame.   Please advise over my receipt and follow up with the employee who took my order. God where has customer service gone."}
{"text":"A note to whoever is the manager:  When your website information claims that you are open until 10:00 pm, it is bad business to close early for all food items. We arrived at 9:45 pm and after waiting to order at around 9:50, we were told the kitchen closed early at 9:50 pm. The drive through had at least five cars in it and we came specifically because we wanted to order off the food menu. We then were stuck waiting in the drive through for other people to get their food because we could not exit, even though we could not order anything. If your business hours state 10 pm, you should remain open until that time. This is pretty much a given in the restaurant industry, even if you in high school and working at a fast food change. I plan on submitting this information onto corporate as I think they will be interested to know how you are not adhering to your advertised business hours."}
{"text":"Place is trash. They need to go back to dairy queen school to learn how to make a dipped cone. The only difference between my large and my kids small was the price."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They screwed up order.  How hard can it be do make plain hamburger,  no cheese? I told the kid taking my order 3 times no cheese.  So when I get order and check it.  Cheese.  Guy goes to remake it and comes back real quick with new burger.  I burn my fingers on burger wrap....  Why you ask? Cause he microwaved the new burger.  Grrrrr.  When I asked him if he microwaved it he said no.  WTH? No way burger was cooked on grill that fast.  Pathetic service."}
{"text":"I should've known something was up when they put lids on my two blizzards and didn't flip them upside. I didn't go with my gut and I wish I did before leaving. Waste of Money. At this location make sure they do the protocol of flipping it upside down before you leave!"}
{"text":"Food is always cold and old as If precooked. Have to wait at counter for several minutes for someone to come out of the back to help you. I thought it was just a timing thing the first time I went but have tried it multiple times. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had to grab a quick, late, on-the way to an appointment lunch and decided to go through the drive thru. My order was taken and I didn't wait for a long time.  My ice cream was packaged to go and not dripping everywhere, lol.  Staff members customer svc was great!  Def will be coming back. (Hamburger was good, too :)"}
{"text":"I love this Dairy Queen! The staff is always respectful and quick! Michael is especially awesome!"}
{"text":"This DQ used to be the best around. Friendly, quick service. That has quickly gone by the way side. The last two times I have gone there I have been completely dissatisfied. The latest time  after having waited in line for more than 15 minutes I was told their system was completely down. The manager asked me if I wanted to leave a credit card number with him for payment so I could leave with my food - leave my credit card number with a complete stranger? I think not!"}
{"text":"El empleado que estaba cerro 30 minutos antes cuando su horario es a las 10:00 pm. Maneje casi 1 hora para venir hasta este casino que lastima"}
{"text":"I love Oreo Cheesecake Blizzards.  Great service! The staff is friendly and fast.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I just discovered this Dairy Queen. I used to go to the one in Willoughby, but I like this one more. They are much faster. 90 seconds tops you will be waiting. Even though it is a walk up DQ, they have everything the normal DQ has -- including log cakes! Yum!"}
{"text":"Tables were always pretty dirty when we would stop by inside, so we decided the drive thru it would be.   There was no line so we were helped right away. We had two mini blizzards.   Our blizzards were made quickly but I was confused when she handed them to me in a brown paper bag without a word. I peeked inside the bag before driving away thinking she had given me food.   I look and see our blizzards with lids on them, um weird. I do know that one of DQ's saying is \"if your blizzards not given to you upside down then it's free.\"   The girl was long gone and there were other cars behind me so I didn't bother asking and jus left. And yes I'm throwing a fit because my blizzard wasn't given to me upside down..."}
{"text":"Great service.. their blizzard were super yummy.. Staff were so friendly and helpful... We will come back soon."}
{"text":"No stars.  Horrible service. Visited the location tonight and counted 8 people behind the counters, no manager in sight and the staff was completely lost.  The two people who ordered ahead of us asked for a refund because their simple order was completely incorrect.  Unless something changes drastically I would avoid this location if at all possible."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick treat with my son and had the best service with the friendliest employees!!! This will be my DQ even if it's out of the way!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, tonight is the last time. My wife an I just went through the drive thru, of the 4 items we ordered, two of which were pup cups, they got 2 times wrong. Pup cups came out perfect..... My wife ordered a chocolate strawberry blizzard, which when we got the item, was a shake of some kind, and I ordered a Heath blizzard, which ended up being an Oreo blizzard. We are just going to end up going to Peterson's Ice Cream. It's a shame, because we did enjoy it while it lasted...."}
{"text":"This place is still a fast food restaurant, so we understand there will be some issues here and there. But for the most part they make killer blizzards. Rarely had any issues with the ice cream."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever revised a Yelp review from not good too bad. On my last Yelp review about this store I complained about the smell inside the store. Everytime you walk in the lobby smells nasty. I've been told multiple times that the smell was coming from outside but I never smell this until I go inside the lobby. So last night around 9 o'clock my wife and I decided that maybe someone had taken care of the smell and we wanted a smoothie but we turned around and walked back out the door as fast as we walked in  because it stunk so bad still.Let me say that I love Dairy Queen food and there are other locations but this one is closest to me and it irritates me that neither a manager or a regional manager cares enough to read a bad Yelp review and at least try to correct the situation. I will be contacting their corporate office. This store Sullies the good name of Dairy Queen. Again the employees are nice the food is good but there is no management delegating and this store stinks everytime you walk in the door."}
{"text":"After finally finding the poorly marked drive thru, sat in front of the speakers of the drive thru for what felt like an eternity and no one ever came to take my order. So when I tried to leave,  then I was stuck behind the car in front of me because they trap you with curbs. Terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered three items in the drive thru. Two drunk people with me made that difficult, but they got the custom orders perfect. The blizzard was served upside down and was not melted at all like I have had bad experiences at a other dairy queen in the area. I will drive here next time for sure! Excellent service with items served as expected!"}
{"text":"Second time in a month I have been here. I wonder why I even came back. The first time we sat in the drive thru, I kid you not, 20 minutes! That was with only one car in front of ours. Why we didn't just drive away, I don't know.   This time we also waited quite a long time. It's just fast food, it shouldn't take as long as a sit down restaurant. The food is okay. The ice cream and desserts is what we go for. My daughter likes the chocolate cones or dilly bars, even though it's not on the menu. The blizzards are kind of melted.   This Dairy Queen is located in the Walmart parking lot, it used to be a long John silvers. It's not the most convenient location."}
{"text":"Here for a fundraiser for Ries Elementary Cheer Team. Service was friendly and prompt. Vanilla shakes and Oreo blizzard were yummy."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Incorrect orders are the norm. It's fairly disgusting (sticky tables, trash everywhere). The last time we stopped in there were seven people working...but maybe actually three doing work. The other four were checking their cellphones or standing around talking. There is one young girl there who works her ass off but the rest contribute to the chaos."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen. I've always been a fan but this location, I'm not too fond of. I've gone there on 3 different occasions and ordered chocolate ice cream. The chocoate ice cream has been sour every single time. I have no clue why! I haven't gone back since which really sucks. Its so close to me but I just don't want to continue going back and having to deal with the same issue I had the past 3 times. Hopefully they can fix this problem so I don't have to drive out of my way to go to another Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is sooo much better than the other ones near by. I will drive out of my way a little to get my blizzard at this location.  It's DQ so I'm not expecting 5 star service but for this location is always good. The one near me at bell and 32nd is always slow and rude. I come to this location cause they're nice and quick. I swear, at the other locations it's like pulling teeth to get a lid and spoon when I go through the drive thru- do that many people go through the drive thru to immediately eat the ice cream?  Anyways, this location always gives me a bag and lid which I appreciate since I'm getting Togo. I feel like I shouldn't have to ask for that when going through the drive thru considering it's watery ice cream. Last time I went to other location was because it spilled all over my car because they never give lid. Thanks union hills dq! I'll keep coming to this one!!"}
{"text":"I only give them 3 stars because they are very inconsistent with their blizzards. 95% of the time we end up with blizzards that aren't properly mixed. Meaning, the bottom half is all vanilla ice cream while the top half is correctly mixed. My husband and I both ordered the Salted Caramel Truffle Blizzard a few weeks ago and they appeared to be made differently.  Mine was primarily vanilla, his chocolate. These our are favorite blizzards and we aren't pleased with the inconsistencies. Especially when they are almost  $5 each. They either need to get rid of employees who don't do their job or train them better."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger lacked any sort of flavor. However that was not the worst point. I watched as the owner/manager berated the cashier loudly and very unprofessionally in front of all the customers. Turns out the cashier was right all along. I will avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"Rude managers, chicken stripes were tiny ... limited menu compared to my dq back home. Overall not worth it. The ice cream is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Sullen unfriendly employees. I like to be THANKED when I'm spending money. Nope, not here. Slowwwwww service in the drive thru. Very small portion, even with an order of a large. It looked like it had been hit with a truck too, all melty and very little topping. Additional charges for ordering half/half toppings: not EXTRA mind you, just half of one and half of another. Very disappointing. I won't be back even though it is right in my neigborhood."}
{"text":"I ordered my Oreo blizzard with extra Oreo. Never got the extra. Went back through the drive-through ordered it again with extra Oreo and paid twice did not get the extra oreo. This is what happens when you have young kids running a store and nobody that actually cares about what's going on. I would never have a bunch of high school kids that are just goofing around, in control of my money. I've been there a few times they just hand the blizzard without a lid and no bag and it's already melting and spilling over...no napkins. This owner needs to get it together. He probably makes so much money he doesn't care. Not going back enough is enough."}
{"text":"great service! Had lunch their and was absolutely amazing. The service was fast and they all worked together. I'm here for training trip with about 30 other swimmers from Rochester, NY. Loved this DQ!!"}
{"text":"We always order our birthday cakes from here. We've never had an issue. However, today we did. We ordered a strawberry blizzard cheesecake and after cutting into the cake we realized it was just regular ice cream cake with strawberries on top. A strawberry-not-cheesecake. Lol. When we called Megan handled the situation. She called her manager and the owner and apologized and said if we bring the cake back we would get a refund. We brought the cake back and Megan was awesome. She was so nice and apologetic about the issue. She asked us to come back again and we said we would. Awesome job Megan!"}
{"text":"Love my pumpkin blizzards. But this location scares me. I went out to my car and locked the doors to eat."}
{"text":"I would go to another Ice cream place.   They are suppose to serve blizzards upside down but don't.  And I called them out on no doing it and they said they don't have to serve the large royals upside down.   That was a clear lie because I went thru another store and they served it upside down with no problem."}
{"text":"It's SO FUNNY!!  Yelp is asking for additional tips on Dairy Queen: Beer & Wine Only OR Full Bar!! LMAO!! Ice cream and fried foods is about all they have, oh and soda! Good grubbin food and ice cream! My fav is the tropical blizard!! I don't like their fried foods very much though...Just the ice cream!"}
{"text":"Love the Blizards! BUT, when my daughter ordered her chocolate Sunday the guy asked if she wanted whip cream on it or not and she said yes. After I paid my husband asked me if we had to pay extra for the whip cream and I said surely not! I walked over there to look at my reciept hanging off the register along with 5-6 others that were never given to those customers and I couldn't read it upsidown. So I asked the guy and he said, \"Oh yea, it was an extra .35 cents.\"  OK, it's just .35 cents, but it really does aggrivate me! You asked a \"Kid?\" Come on...I can totally agree with 35 cents or more for added guacamoli since avacado's are 1.00 each and they might have 1-2 avacado's in your side, but 35 cents for something that should be on a Sunday anyway? These things costabout .79 cents a can and they can probably get 10 Sunday's out of it. At least McDonalds doesn't charge yme when I ask for whip cream!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure exactly where out DQ's are out here in the Bay.  But it was a late night, and it was hot, I've already eaten dinner, wanted something sweet.  I'm not a real dessert fan...I'd rather eat FOOD. I was gonna get a blizzard or something, but opted for a cherry 'rush' think slushie....something wasn't quite right....wasn't icey enough for me, maybe because they cut the machine off, considering they were closing in 10min. but so what....  but it sure wasn't nothing that my Effen black cherry vodka couldn't fix!!!! a good nite it was :)"}
{"text":"The drive thru line always takes forever, and its layout is really awkward. There are always nothing but teens working, so customer service can be lacking at times. Appreciate the free pup cups for the dog, but it's a gamble whether they can get your Blizzard order correct. One of us always ends up at home with something completely opposite of what we ordered."}
{"text":"This location has gone down hill over the past several years. Service is often slow. Many of the staff members exhibit an attitude of not caring and our order today was not done correctly. After several years of supporting thisblocation, they have lost a customer."}
{"text":"Worst service imaginable waited 45 minutes when I asked for my order The cashier asked the manager in the back how they were doing on the order she responded \" I'm still not done with it \" yelling back at the cashier asked you could see all the Frustration The manager was throwing food on top of the cook line counter \"Never going back to this location"}
{"text":"One of the last DQ's to still carry my childhood favorite! - the Cherry Dip Cone. I go there solely for this. The customer service at this location is pretty bad, staff seems to be only very young girls and the older male manager. Don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!  Evening staff  boldly tried to SHORT CHANGE me!!!!!!  Completely unapologetic and knew EXACTLY how much she was short when I called her on it!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a blizzard! They are so good! I've also ordered a custom ice cream blizzard sheet cake for a birthday party & they decorated it so good. And the ice cream cake was so good."}
{"text":"Ordered a blizzard at the drive thru. They put lids in everything at this location and put the entire order in a bag, so you don't see your ice cream until you have left the window. My blizzard was underfilled, and runny, and not what I ordered."}
{"text":"Always amazing food and service. Love their chicken Parm sandwich. Their blizzards are awesome too."}
{"text":"Good place for ice cream all year round. Friendly, efficient employees. The seating area was clean and well stocked with napkins and condiments.   A very consistent location. Not to mention there's usually 2 for 1 coupons in the newspaper!"}
{"text":"Lousy service...ordered a blizzard with pineapple and banana and got a cup of runny ice cream with two pieces of bananas and crushed peanuts. Save yourselves the trouble and go to another ice cream place!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of DQ simply because of the delicious ice cream and blizzards they have.  Lately, Ive also been more impressed with the food selections as well.  They may seem a little pricey for some of the combos, but I also find that they have some really inexpensive deals on daily combos and of course the $5 buck lunch is always a cheap option as well."}
{"text":"My husband went in to get some ice cream for us, and he was literally in there for 35 minutes. They had three girls working AND a cashier, and they were averaging two orders every ten minutes. They also didn't know what a Pecan Mudslide was, even though it's posted on the \"secret menu\" right next to the register. They told my husband they didn't have it. This DQ needs to do some serious training for their employees."}
{"text":"Went there tonight to pick up some food for me and my son, the cheese curds tasted like frost bite, the honey BBQ chicken fingers and fries were so soggy I couldn't eat them. I asked twice when I ordered to have the fries well done and again at the window and they were super undercooked like they were messing with me. Looks like I won't be going here ever again, I suggest you do the same unless you like soggy food and the taste of frost bite."}
{"text":"By far the WORST Dairy Queen I have ever had. Not one of our 6 blizzards could pass the upside down test and we told the guy and he didn't care just ignored us and walked away. Our ice cream was soup horrible customer service. Definitely going to cold stone next time for sure. Two guys working there was a guy with brown hair and a beard and a younger kid that didn't say a word except for \"what would you guys like\" and \"your total is...\" Horrible service..."}
{"text":"Great place to get frozen treats, can't go wrong coming here on a hot day! I love blizzards and all the frozen treats they offer. Great place to bring kids as well."}
{"text":"I really wish the mic didn't have a mute button because the guy taking our order was cussing at customers in the drive through... If you don't like your job, find another one. Awful customer service and crappy ice cream. Oh and a tip for the employees based on my experience and all the bad reviews I've read (obviously isn't a problem just tonight) try smiling once and a while or treat people with respect."}
{"text":"Very sad to say that this location is not doggy friendly! They do not offer pup cups to our furry friends even though every other location I've been to offers them complimentary. How disappointing."}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix, Dairy Queen was a staple in our lives.  Its hot as hell most of the time so any type coolness is required.  After the zoo my mom was having the craving for some ice cream.  With a car full of my family we drove over here to the drive through.  I don't eat ice cream any more due to lactose intolerance.  I was pretty much the chauffeur for this trip.  My mom got a regular Chocolate Sunday, my aunt got a Root Beer Float, my grandma go regular Vanilla cone and I think my uncle got a Chocolate Sunday sans nuts.  Again, service was very nice.  The lady didn't mind as my mom leaned over and yelled the orders then still, at the window, leaned over me to talk to her.  We probably looked crazy."}
{"text":"Only come for the blizzards. Service is always awful. Wish DQ could get their act together. Really want to like and enjoy coming here, instead of being angry each time for the lack of service and hustle they possess."}
{"text":"Great place for burger and Fries or soft serve goodness... a particularly enjoy the  $5 lunch which is a full meal and a sundae."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my wife's birthday.    When I went to pick it  up it wasn't made.    The manager pretty much told me there wasn't anything she could do about it.    I refused to spend another cent at this establishment!"}
{"text":"While the food and treats are good and the service was good I cannot give a fast food joint anything but one star if they charge for sauces, especially ranch. I mean DQs are the only fast food restaurant that I know of that does this at least in the western US.  If sauces where free at least with purchases of items you would use them they would get 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times over the years.  The $5 lunch has always been good, until this last visit. Either the speaker was not working right or too many people talking.  I ordered the cheeseburger, got the bacon bbq burger.  Burger was kinda gross.  I ordered 2 pup cups (ice cream for my dogs.)  Was asked several times if pups were in the car (no, and they ask because you get one free, or so it was at another location up on Greenway).  Either the cups I got at Greenway location were extra big or this one was small because they were half the size and half again as expensive as the Greenway location. Disapointed!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! Me and my girlfriend stop in here at least once a week. Cashier is always nice and the order always comes out in just a couple of minutes or less."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place I have to ask what don't they have so I can order appropriately. They are always out of something or something is not working. Ice cream is always soft. I think the only thing they can do right is microwave pretzels."}
{"text":"30Mins in drive through for a burger!!! And then she forgot my drink and claimed she was the manager and told me that she didn't know what was going on... and these morons want $15/hr!!! What a joke!!! I'll never come back here again"}
{"text":"I LOVE DQ so I wanted to say that 1st. I've worked @ one in IL, FL & AZ. The company is great. When I attempted to order a package of ice cream sandwiches I was told that they didn't have any made.  Also, I was asked if I wanted whipped cream on my shake & said yes. I didn't notice when accepting the food through the drive thru that there wasn't any whipped cream. To add, I asked the employee if I could purchase a kids drink (what happened to the 12oz blizzard cup) at the window & was surprised to hear this store didn't offer kids drinks. This is after the employee making me a kids cone. I even tried to interject and say you heard kids drink right? She nodded her head & I watched the other employee make a cone. After that was thrown away, I asked If I could purchase a small drink & the total was over $3.50 (16 oz fountain?). That price is high for this area. I didn't order a drink. All in all, I didn't leave with what I would have like to order, I didn't get exactly what I did order & it was a confusing ordering process.  I like DQ so much I would be embarrassed if a friend of mine comes to this store and receives the same service because it makes DQ look bad. I think I will continue to drive a little further & visit the other local DQ on Gilbert Rd. near the heritage district. I hope the owner can help the employees with their service. Side note: I'm not complaining for me personally as I benefitted but the blizzards were WAY over the top of the cup. Fortunately there was a sundae lid on each as they were already melting but that's a lot of product/money  going out of the window. I know there's measurements ;) I still love DQ. Also I had to cut my feedback on the actual store survey because there's a character limit on my feedback. Another surprise. At least Yelp loves long reviews"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here. We ordered 2 small dipped cones and one of them was EXTREMELY small. When I told the girl at the window, she just took the cones with an attitude and closed the window. Another girl came to the window and I explained that one of the cones was really small and she said that they \"weigh\" the cones. We were regular customers so we know what small cones are supposed to look like...and this cone was even smaller than a child size cone. They didn't offer to re-do the one cone, so I just offered to pay extra to upgrade to a medium. The original girl came back to the window, charged us for the additional amount for the larger cones and handed us the two cones...and one of them was STILL much smaller! She just handed the cones to us with a pissy look and closed the window. No apology, she didn't say \"thank you\" like most drive thru staff would do....just an attitude. She clearly had no social skills and shouldnt be dealing with customers. As she was closing the window, I told her that she doesn't need to have an attitude. At that point, she opened the window and told me that she doesn't have an attitude. I'm usually very tolerant, but being in customer service myself, I just cant tolerate rudeness."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dairy Queen I have ever been too. If their ice cream machines are running, which they have not been running on three different occasions, they are likely to make you wait in the parking lot while they make your food/treats. Last time I visited they brought out our blizzards in a carrier with the ice cream literally spilling over the sides. The associate said sorry and walked away. On other occasions when we have been inside, it seems as if their are a lot of kids working with no adult supervision. Very dirty inside and smells a little funny. The list goes on and on, I recommend settling for Surprise's other ice cream locations."}
{"text":"Love this DQ staff always positive and eager to help. Love the Pecan Cluster Blizzard. Fan for life!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Staff member I dealt with was not very friendly at all. I ordered a Blizzard and basically got vanilla ice cream  in a cup. I went back to show the employee that took my order and was met with attitude. The gentleman behind the counter took my cup, threw a few more pieces of chocolate into the cup and gave it back to me instead of making me a new one. Obviously cheap owners here. There's even a sign in the store that states \"cakes do not come with cutlery\" or something along those lines. How cheap can you get??? Will never ever go back to that location."}
{"text":"This DQ is so ghetto, I love it! Located next to the old hospital on Queen, this DQ has been around since I was a little kid, and I'm glad that nothing has ever changed. There's still the little ice-cream cone signs beckoning you to their parking lot, which has always oddly devoured the place itself in size. There's still the little picnic table patio. And there's still the huge digital sign advertising the same freaking items and prices that they've had for the past 20 years.  Now, based on service and nostalgia, this should've been a 4-5 star review, easy. There are 2 things that knock it back. One is how insanely busy it gets on weekends and on certain nights. Just absolute madness. The other is the size of the interior. Pretty claustrophobic, especially when the place is busy. It's next to impossible to wait in line to get into this place without being body-checked at least once, which is pretty annoying (and a little scary) when you're trying to walk out with ICE CREAM.  As for the ice cream itself...standard DQ goodness. It's pretty hard to screw up ice cream, and they don't. I also have a burning lust for their ice cream cakes, but that's a whole other beast, which I avoid at all costs.  Enjoy, and try to get there early!"}
{"text":"No stars! If I could I would. Just horrible service what more can I say. I go to DQ for the ice cream all over the valley and this has to be the worst. Dirty store and attitudes is not a great summer ice cream trip. Stay away"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this Dairy Queen! I arrived about five minutes before closing. The staff was friendly, fast, and my blizzard tasted great! I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Another new product and my annual summer Blizzard run collided this year on my visit to DQ. They have three new Royale Blizzards - I got the Rocky Road version, which is supposed to have a marshmallow center, along with peanuts and brownie pieces in vanilla soft serve. It was served upside down as well. Due to summer heat, the marshmallow core never stayed in the middle - it kind of shifted and ended up mostly on the bottom. Otherwise, the thing had too many peanuts and basically morphed into a normal blizzard. I think it was like a buck more for the Royale, but skip it and get the normal blizzard - nothing ever looks like the photos in the commercials."}
{"text":"I was finally able to visit the new DQ in Fort Mill yesterday when it wasn't jammed pack with people. Very curteous staff and great soft serve ice cream. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nurse, I need 50 cc's of Blizzard stat!   This patient needs soft-serve . . . soft-serve so sugary sweet that it leaves a layer of crystals on the surface of the teeth.  Nurse, there's only one place that offers that level of sugar in a soft-serve.  We need some Dairy Queen.  What?  What kind of topping?   Damn it, Nurse! I'm busy operating here.  M&Ms? Reese's peanut butter cups? Chocolate cookie dough?  Damn it, I don't have time for this debate.  This patient is suffering without that soft-serve.    What? Burger or chicken fingers? Are you crazy? Everything at DQ that doesn't involve ice cream is too greasy.  I said this man needs a Blizzard.  Well done Nurse.  Just in time.  Thanks to this peanut butter cup Blizzard, the patient will survive.  Better remind the patient to brush his teeth before bed, though."}
{"text":"I am disgusted with the restaurant!!! Let's see... cater to kids and tell my 5 year old grandson to cross a seriously busy street (Central Ave.) to use the bathroom at a Boston Market.  How about this Dairy Queen... Get a F'ing bathroom for your patrons!!!!  It is pitiful you can't even wash your hands before you eat - that leaves us with the question what your employees do when they need to wash or use the restroom while preparing patron's food."}
{"text":"Stepped in with the squad three deep with the highest hopes of greatness after peepin' the online menu one time. With ice cream on my mind and cheese curds in my heart I placed an order of simplest form.   Ya boy had to wait 25min. for those curds. Despite the food being excellent, the customer service left more to be desired. Me and my squad went from one hundred to zero real quick. My strawberry shake is very on point though."}
{"text":"It's a Dairy Queen, so kind of a known quantity. We came on a Sunday to get some ice cream, and decided to eat in. The building is very ugly on the outside, and just as bad on the inside. The ceiling tiles are in bad shape, with lots broken and stained. The whole ceiling looks bad. The floor was dirty and had lots of trash on it. I couldn't leave quick enough after eating. Probably the worst Dairy Queen I have ever walked into."}
{"text":"This is a pretty annoying DQ location. There's no drive-thru. It's a bit rundown and not particularly clean looking. It's under-staffed. They never seem to have any ice cream cakes available. Their Blizzards are all melty and not as good as other locations. While this one may the be the closest location to me, I'll be driving a little further and going to one of the other locations."}
{"text":"This is one awful location.   Slow service, disinterested and untrained staff.  Smells awful as well, like the fryers are overheating.  I love Dairy Queen ice cream but this place is being neglected by ownership."}
{"text":"DQ.  I remember you well.  You walk up inside, place your order & wait.  It can get a little cramped in if there are too many kiddies waiting on their ice-cream cone.   Servers are nice.  There is nice outdoor seating.  Weekday specials are available too.  Behind the DQ is a putting / driving range."}
{"text":"The soft Ice Cream is very good; however they are not consistent on the quantity of what you get for your money. Don't go though the drive though just after school lets out, the children love to chat at the window."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen can be so hit & miss. This particular location, while in electic Plaza Midwood, always looks run down to me. :/ It packs in the people though. Any given day in the spring & summer, you find a line of people, whether they walked up or drove up.   As the other reviewers pointed out, it's not the resturaunt DQ. I didn't know the difference. Growing up Mooresville, we had the same \"walk up\" DQ as here, but it was much smaller.  This afternoon, my boyfriend wanted a Blizzard, a Nutter Butter one to be exact. Like Jeff S., he got it & it was immediately runny & melting like crazy. It also lacked a lot of Nutter Butter pieces. He was ok with it, however, if it were me, I would have been disappointed.  I agree with Faith, they need benches or seating areas - especially considering there's not much of a parking lot there."}
{"text":"This branch just opened up, so of course, my co-workers and I had to give it a try. Rather than write about generic DQ stuff which applies to every DQ that everyone already knows, I'll just mention a few things about this branch in particular. Being brand new, it seems like they are still working out some kinks. We ordered in a group, so we noticed a few things were inconsistent, such as the volume of ice cream among identical orders, a few communication issues, all very minor things. The staff however was very friendly and good senses of humor about everything, so it was very easy to forgive.  I'm not sure how often I would be coming here other than to deal with an occasional insatiable desire for a Blizzard, but it's nice to know there is one close by."}
{"text":"I have never been in a Dairy Queen with employees as sweet as the ones at this location. I didn't get their names but they had the closing shift tonight. Thanks for the top notch service right before you closed up for the night!"}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying I gave 1 star but I wish I could give less. The choice of the owner not to honor the customer appreciation day and charge people a $1 for a $2 ice cream cone on a day when the whole company is advertising free cone and customer appreciation day is low and shows a lack of respect to the loyal customers. Not to mention the large numbers of customers that turned and walked away never to return I know as a customer I shop where I feel my patronage is appreciated and that is not here."}
{"text":"I scream! You scream! We all scream for ice cream, and my kids no matter how old they get scream the loudest for ice cream cakes from Dairy Queen! It's definitely a given in our family that if it's birthday time we are ordering a cake from DQ! Without fail I've used this specific DQ location year after year, and every time I've been able to get what I've needed. They offer friendly service, ready made cakes from $20-$25, there's always someone available to write on a bday message, tasty flavors from cookie dough, Oreo, strawberry cheesecake, to the original DQ favorite with the bottom layer of gooey cookie crumble goodness!  No need to shop any further, it's a cake and ice cream in one! However if it's busy  and I've stared at the menu long enough or this Mama has a sweet tooth it's the perfect place to get a scrumptious blizzard, caramel moolate,  a dilly bar, or a cone, just don't tell my kids! :)"}
{"text":"Great little location! Cute booths, tables and high tops. Friendly service, food is okay. Blizzard minis are the bomb. Buy one get one for $.99 offer is sweet! They were nice about keeping our Blizzard chilled until we had finished our entree. We will be back."}
{"text":"I will only go to this Dairy Queen...   You can tell that it is run by a family. This past summer he has been teaching his kids how to work there, but don't get me wrong... The service still has been great.   I have never had any issues at this location and of course it tastes delicious. It's always packed too but they're so quick it's never been a problem even when the line is out the door.   My only warning is... Watch your cars and be safe at night. Once we were there and a man was checking for locked cars of course he ran off when he saw us. But be aware you're close to some shady areas."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, kids working here don't care about their jobs and it clearly shows.  The ice cream is just like any other DQ- good but over priced."}
{"text":"Wanted to do something nice for my wife and pick up an Orange Julius on my way to see her at the hospital (our daughter is in NICU). I had never been but had heard that there was an Orange Julius in a Dairy queen fairly nearby. I pulled up and sure enough there was a large, installed (permanent) 'Orange Julius' sign on the building. I left with no Julius', though.  Upon asking for an orange julius the very kind young man behind the counter recited a well-rehearsed (apparently often-repeated) speech about how \"The slush machine is down right now and that is the main ingredient in an Orange Julius, but we do have.....\" so I texted my wife to see if that sounded good. Not 30 seconds after saying it to me, the young man said the same thing about the frappe to the next customer - it is important to note that one of the big poster/advertisements in the window is for the frappe, which you cannot actually get.   Not Julius for me, no frappe for the next guy. These guys need to either fix/replace the slush machine (it makes SLUSH for crying out loud, how hi-tech can it be?) or remove the signs that lead you to believe you can get any of the great things that rely on slush.   My hopes of being a hero to my wife were the only thing that got slushed today. Thanks, DQ."}
{"text":"They produce consistent products. Service was okay. We got a mint malt, Mint Dilly Bar, and 2  Blizzards. Nice treat on a Sunday evening after a delicious meal.   Tip: Try their $5 Lunch Meal deals: entree (chicken tenders or a burger), drink, fries and a dessert."}
{"text":"A Dairy Queen is a Dairy Queen - in my experience their ice cream at least is always consistently worth a visit. This particular DQ is a small service-only stand. It's actually nice because it means I can easily get a large sweet treat, take it home, and put part of it into the freezer to avoid eating the whole thing at once. That said, I don't think there's really any seating available for anyone who isn't getting their ice cream to go; I saw people sitting in their cars and on the curb when I visited.  I admittedly think - at least based on my last visit - there is room for improvement in the workflow and service. For example, the staff only used one window to collect and deliver orders. It probably would have helped to take orders at one window and deliver the orders to guests at the other. This is highlighted by the way a cashier tried to take a credit card at the same time that another worker was trying to hand me my ice cream. That's a lot of activity for one small space. A bigger problem in my mind was that the staff were bickering about who was doing what during my visit, and not quietly. Whether or not that affected their concentration I can't be sure, although they did almost forget to give me my drink.  There's definitely room for improvement, but like I said earlier, a Dairy Queen is a Dairy Queen. If you like Dairy Queen, there's no major reason to avoid this one, as the ice cream was good and the service quick."}
{"text":"Drive-thru window was super convenient. The speaker and receiver system wasn't working very well, so we had to repeat our order 3 times. Blizzard and mint malt was correct. Props to the server who offered whipped cream for our malt. Price points are nice! We will be back. I wonder what the possibility of someone fixing the speaker system is.....Hmmmm."}
{"text":"My family and I were starving and pulled through the drive-through window. We got barbecue chicken strips which my daughter thought was pretty good. The two burgers were alright. We had a bacon cheeseburger and a mushroom and Swiss burger. They were alright. It took care of our hunger and were grateful."}
{"text":"Sometimes, they have great service, others not so much. Love the fact I can leave my house in my pjs and not get out of my car for ice cream! Thank goodness for DQ drive thru"}
{"text":"The worst! 40 minutes in the drive thru, which included over 10 minutes at the window, watching the server walking around in circles. Had to argue about my change, then our order was wrong, food was luke warm, fries were way too salty, Swiss mushroom burger had like one mushroom chopped up on it, and deep fried mushrooms were doughy. Ended up throwing most of it away."}
{"text":"The $3.09 plus tax ice cream dipped cone was so poorly made.  Chocolate dip was thin...and clumpy.  Customer service....wasn't even service.  Never 107th Dairy Queen"}
{"text":"Just got here. The nice lady took my order and out the door I went with a fantastic peanut buster parfait! Clean, fast, super nice people. 5 star!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now trying to give them money for one of their products. They are to busy counting out their cash drawer to sell me something. I was told, \"I can't help you for at least five to ten minutes.\" Even when telling him I'll give him cash without needing change, he was too busy to help.  Where has customer service gone?"}
{"text":"Great joint.  Nice, clean and, what else can you say, it is DAIRY QUEEN!"}
{"text":"If you were at Dairy Queen tonight, sorry for causing the seven car back up.  Unfortunately the staff felt the need to force us to order a sundae instead of allowing us to order an ice cream with a topping as is advertised on their menu board and as we have done twice weekly for the last three months.  The manager, Chantel laughed at us to our faces claiming company policy, while the original staff member was complaining about us to other staff.  We asked repeatedly for him to discontinue and asked the manager to have him stop while we were still there, but customer service isn't what it used to be.  Better to make us upset and cause a back up then to honor your advertised menu board."}
{"text":"The other night I was craving a Peanut-Buster Parfait but had no desire to schlep inside the nearby Dairy Queen.  I was feeling lazy, bra-less and make-up free.  Easy solution, I thought. Drive a little farther to the drive-thru Dairy Queen. YES!!!    Central was eerily vacant of cars, so I made it there in no time. It took a while for someone to take my order and then when I got up to the window, this young kid looked at me and asked if I was \"so and so.\" At first I thought I didn't hear him right so I said, \"What?\" He repeated the name. I ponder it for a moment, and with a scrunched look, I said \"Uh, no.\"   I paid, got my change and drove off.  But I started thinking on the way home: could that have been a secret code? For a drug-deal? Or some cool rave party? Damn! I should have said \"YES!\" I could've had some extra fun with my Parfait!  Oh, well.  It hit the spot. I'll be back again, and maybe the next time I'll remember to say \"yes\" if asked a random question."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Dairy Queen a few different times and we really have never gotten exceptional service. Tonight was no different and was very disappointing. 6/29/2018. There were several young kids working there and none of them were friendly. Two of the girls were quite rude giving attitude when we asked for the sundae to go and if we could have a bag. We got the eye roll.... Also the portions are quite small. Probably won't return to this surprise location. We'll give our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great for a quick Blizzard fix. My son loves the burgers I haven't tried the food besides the blizzard"}
{"text":"very good customer service i only had to wait a few minutes even though it was a saturday night and it was really busy i tried the cookie dough blizzard and the oreo blizzard and they were both really yummy  they also gave us cute little jurassic park cups  overall good experience and i would go again :)"}
{"text":"Their food is actually ok, but never very fresh tasting (especially the fries).  Really, most people want to go there for ice cream, but save yourself the money!  I got a blizzard that was half melted before I got home (only about 5 minutes, and it wasn't that hot outside).  The ice cream has that chunky icy stuff that happens either with old ice cream that's been sitting around a while or like what happens in McDonalds shakes.  And my blizzard was supposed to be cookie dough and brownie, but even that wasn't very good.  I love, love, love ice cream, and I ended up throwing half my blizzard away.  Totally disappointing."}
{"text":"this location is okay. they need to read their tickets better. I asked for things not to be put on my burger and they put it on there anyway. they also need to stop deep frying their bacon. hard as rock."}
{"text":"For the most part I like this place. It's the closest burger joint to my house.  The drive thru wait time typically varies from wow that was quick to holy crap i could've gone out of my car go to the bathroom inside come back and my order would still be in the process of being made. The burgers and chicken sandwiches are always solid (well, as far as fast food burgers go I suppose), I usually don't have the shakes and smoothies so I can't vouch for it that much.   Now my main problem is there's a dip in service at around the dinner hours. I've never had a problem with the afternoon to mid-afternoon staff but, as of writing this review, this is the second time the night staff has forgotten parts of my order (i.e. an actual burger or chicken sandwich), and they've never been big orders either. I'm not sure what happens but its frankly a bit annoying. It won't keep me from coming to this location yet but it's starting to get a bit frustrating.   tl;dr: Food: 8 (as far as fast food goes) Service: 9 (during afternoons), 6 (during nights)"}
{"text":"DQ is expensive and I am not sure why. It's not even that good. I do like their blizzards, but that's about it. I decided to order something different so I decided on a brownie sundae. It came with vanilla soft serve, 3 small brownie pieces, and some oreo crumbles. The total was $5 and some change! 3/4 of it was the ice cream! Total rip if you ask me.   As far as the store, it was kind of dingy. Also I did notice that they have babies working there. The kid who took our order was like 16. One of his little friends stopped by and they were chasing each other around the store play fighting. Also he gave him free ice cream. What the hell. I want free ice cream!! There didn't seem to be any real management on staff. I wonder what happens if a customer has a legitimate issue and needs to speak with a manager? Oh well I don't even care that much, just a general observation."}
{"text":"Best Dairy Queen around. Great service, great ice cream and food! They're cakes are the best too!"}
{"text":"Don't buy any food! It is an afterthought. My wife wanted a banana split so I figured I would just pick up dinner as well. Huge mistake, I ordered a double cheeseburger, chicken finger basket and a grilled cheese. All of the food was worse than a supermarket parking lot carnival. I was asked to pull into a parking space instead of holding up the drive through line(nobody was behind me)but I figured at least the food would be fresh. I was wrong! Double cheeseburger was room temp when it arrived at my car and the beef patty was straight up cold and chewy(maybe left over from lunch). Chicken fingers also seemed to be cooked hours before as they came out limp with the coating falling off and again cold. The grilled cheese was edible. Great ice cream! But seriously, don't serve food if you don't want to do it right.  I have been coming to this DQ for 20 years but will not come again. I will drive the extra mile to southern and McClintock in hopes that it is a properly managed store and knows how to serve food that at least can arrive warm."}
{"text":"Crap service, staff too busy screwing around at the drive up window. Only two people in line and still had to wait for 5-7 minutes to be acknowledged took our order and requested the ice cream to be delayed sat around waiting for ice cream with two 5 year olds gave up on waiting and went to smiths instead. Great food shit service just use the drive through from now on"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Worst business ever.  I waited 30 minutes for a sundae and never got it.  I asked for a refund.  Clerk gave me a refund but couldn't provide a credit slip.  I never did get the credit so I ended up disputing the charge with my bank."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a zero star if I could, I ordered a mini royal Blizzard and got a cup full of nasty fake fudge topped with a small amount of ice cream so very disappointed"}
{"text":"SAVE your time and money and go to a different Dairy Queen. The Two girls at the front made us wait while they laughed and talked amongst themselves. Then our food came up super fast which surprised me. Ordered my favorite pretzel sticks which I've always gotten fresh hot and so good! Until tonight, hungry and go to bite into my pretzel and it's so cold it feels like it was frozen, then got a dirty look when returning food I purchased and expected to be hot atleast\"! I won't be returning we ordered other food cold chicken tenders and rude service, where do these managers get their employees from? Straight out of high school or for a bored part time job, no thanks won't recieve mine or my friends business anymore. Despicable"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is run by teens with ignorant attitudes.  The sign on the wall says \" Buy one blizzard at reg price and size and get another for only ,99 cents\"  I did that - got charged the reg amount for two smalls 4.99 each for a total of 10.00  SO I ask the girl WHY we didn't get that deal? She says \"Because you have to ask for it\"  so I reply \"So if we don't ask for something that is clearly advertised - you just rip the customer off??!\"  she shrugs and says yes - so I ask again if the MGMT would agree with what she just said - she said yes and I was being rude (Apparently - if you ask why you were just BLANTANTLY RIPPED OFF to a millennial teen - they get all offended and consider YOU rude!!)  Her name is ANGELICA  And one wonders why these businesses are failing all over town!  No apology - no accountability that they are committing fraud on their customers.  MARIA is the MGR I will be contacting tomorrow to verify this claim as to not offer the deal your store is advertising and why she has a total idiot hired in the afternoon who is obnoxious and could care less about the customers.  The countless reviews below don't lie - this place is rude and will rip you off and is totally ok with it. I am contacting the head office with this also - total disgusting behavior and wanton disregard for customers - typical of so many small businesses these days!"}
{"text":"Ordered a strawberry banana shake and the leaves are all throughout my shake. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"A Brampton institution: the DQ at Queen and Centre. You go inside, you order at the long counter. There are not many places to sit inside, but that's OK, because there are tons of places to sit outside. OK, so in the winter that's not ideal, but you know... it's more of a takeout place.   The staff are always friendly enough. I mean it's fast food so I am not looking for anyone to really kiss my butt. It's good enough. No bad experiences in all of my visits and I am glad to see young people getting all the good food service lessons I got as a teenager.  We all know why we're there, right? The Blizzards? They are so good. I kinda want one now that I am writing this.   Anyway -- everything is as it should be at the Dairy Queen. Now go get a Blizzard and eat the hell out of it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 starts I would. My boyfriend and I walked in for some soft serve ice cream and stood in like for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging our existence. 2 employees walked by and looked at us but none of them he the ability to say hello. I understand they were busy but \"hello will be right with you\" hardly requires any efforts. Needless to say we walked out!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Dairy Queen I have ever been to. I am currently sitting in this dirty excuse for a Dairy Queen and I have been waiting for like 1/2 an hour while car after car gets served and I I sit there and wait.  I finally got my order and it's wrong. They made my Sunday's first and they are melted so they have to make them again.   The worst ever."}
{"text":"when a lot of DQ's are stop serving chocolate ice cream, as you see this location still still serve chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the very first time today. The service was quick and friendly. I had the 5 Buck 3 chicken strip lunch. The chicken strips were served hot and were cooked just about right. The fries were mediocre. The fact that the meal comes with ice cream makes this one of the better \"$5\" meals in the industry."}
{"text":"It took them 4 times to get one of our ice cream cones right. I finally just accepted what they made. The medium cones varied in size significantly. The staff appears to be goofing off and didn't want to stop their \"play time\" to get my order right. I was not offered any refund for the inconvenience. I won't be back. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Great Dairy Queen. Delicious blizzards! The staff -particularly Alisha at the drive thru - were so sweet to us, even though we showed up right before they were closing and we changed our order twice!  Thanks Dairy Queen!"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price.  For a quick butger fix. But still prefer mcdo, burger king, wendy's as fast food.  For premium I go to smash, fat burgers or five guys. Or I cook myself"}
{"text":"This was the worst Dairy Queen we have ever been in. It was filthy tables,chairs,floor and bathrooms the mens was out of order. Service was poor my ice cream was dripping all over no one bothered to tell us our order was ready. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Always a good go-to when I'm craving ice cream. Their menu offers a variety of different cool treats so there's something for everyone. I always opt to go through the drive-thru and the staff get you through quickly and efficiently. All in all, a great DQ location that I'll keep coming back to, especially when the weather starts getting warmer."}
{"text":"What is not to love about this place? First, they serve ice cream! Most importantly Oreo Blizzards, the one other companies try to copy.   Second this location is fastest to get to from Uptown. Sure, the location in Plaza Midwood is physically closer but you have to get through all of the traffic & construction to get out of 277. Let's not even begin to talk about the Central Ave train getting in the way of your sugar fix. Take my advice, Wilkinson Blvd is faster. Granted there is no view of uptown once you're here but the important part is the ice cream.  Third the staff is always nice and fast with those wonderfully cool and tasty refreshments. Technically I know they serve hot dogs too, but c'mon oreo blizzards!   Fourth is the community vibe. Little kids roaming around, adults that just want a moment to relax, people passing through town from the airport, long time residents, literally every walk of Charlotte life comes by here while you're ordering or sitting and enjoying your treat.  Fifth is the sole reason I'm holding back a fifth star. They have wifi. However the last time I was here it wasn't working. If this place gets a reliable internet connection, I may gain weight working remotely & noming oreo blizzards here!"}
{"text":"With the recent influx of tea bars, smoothie and frozen yogurt shops in CLT, Dairy Queen seems like a relic of a bygone era. If you should want a true Americana treat, DQ is still the place for a chili dog or a vanilla and chocolate twist cone.  Count me in, right?  Though I can't say enough about their soft serve ice cream (silky, creamy, not too sweet, perfect texture), I wish I could say the same about their Plaza Midwood shop or the employees.  Sure it has a nice retro feel, but there is no seating nor restrooms.  I suppose this wards off loiterers, but it seems downright unfriendly.  On the three occasions I've visited, the staff have always been curt.  I get better service (and seating, restrooms) at the DQ in Cotswold and Matthews.  Come on DQ, you can do better!"}
{"text":"Not happy with this store. Dip my cone to were I can't see the ice cream thru dipping chocolate. Ugh"}
{"text":"The line was long but did move quickly.  We can cones and then tried the new Apple blizzard and the pumpkin blizzards.  They were both outstanding and reasonably priced . It is too bad that they do not serve both of these choices after december"}
{"text":"The WORST Dairy Queen franchise ever. They are always OUT of Chocalate ice cream and Always get my order wrong. Ridiculously SLOW service. Avoid this place! Horrible."}
{"text":"New management but same poor training and employee attitude.  Cold food and when asked the employee if the wrap was supposed to be cold.  She said it wasn't because she made it herself in the microwave.  I said you better check the microwave and she gave me more attitude.  Don't expect much here!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible menu changes, greedy ownership pulling back long-standing deals, and cutting corners on the food (ex. using two heavily breaded chicken fingers rather than one lightly breaded chicken patty (like DQs outside this area) for their chicken parm sandwich.) That sums up why we've gone from 3-5 times per month to once every 2-3 months*. The only good thing I can say about it is that everyone but the owner is friendly all of the time.  *Somewhat influenced by their overpriced, shrunken slushes price point compared to Jack Flash's huge slushes for the same price."}
{"text":"I mean it's Dairy Queen. What else do you need to know? The tables and floor are a sticky mess and this location is getting dated and needs to us that month they're closed too bring in a giant steam hose to bring it back to beautiful.  But like I said it's Dairy Queen, I came for the ice cream not the decor."}
{"text":"This place is so close to home and as much as I usually love ice cream and wanted to love it I really am annoyed by this place. I've been here 3 times. Something is wrong every single time. Hair in my food once. I bought a groupon but the employee was totally lost on how to redeem it so just flat out did not accept it. Forgot an item from my order."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon my sons and I decided to go to this Dairy Queen. One of my sons said Sonic but no I didn't listen. So we drove to that side of town. We asked for burgers, they had no burgers. We asked chicken strips, no chicken strips. We asked for fries, no fries. We asked for onion rings, no onion rings. I got a chicken ranch sandwich and got the most sandwich I have ever seen. In place of the fries I got a bag of chips called Mitchum. My ice cream sundae was watered down. For the four drinks I ordered they gave me 1 straw. I am mad and a few other adjectives I won't name. Don't go there. The only reason i got anything was because I went to sit in the car and let the boys get what they wanted"}
{"text":"Not impressed by this place! The whole place is ran by a bunch of teenagers who just dont care. Blizzards are lacking ingredients and not mixed well. Orders get mixed up and you end up with the wrong blizzard. I love DQ but I wont go back here."}
{"text":"I went in here the other night to purchase a couple of Blizzards since I wanted to treat myself. It was my first time there. As I walk in I notice how outdated the place is. It looks like it's 10 years past due a remodel. Normally I go to Baskin Robbins but didn't feel like driving there. The service was good, the lady at the register was very nice and polite. What I didn't like were the prices. Considering they don't use real ice cream and it's just soft serve I didn't think their  prices would be so high. I was there so I got two blizzards. While I waited I used the restroom, that bathroom was so disgusting it made me rethink my purchase. When I came out I picked up my order and left. The product was ok, not worth the price though."}
{"text":"Never come here the other DQ's are waaaaaaay better! had a coupon because they fucked up my order last time, came back in after 2 weeks and they tell me they can't accept my coupon? Then why the fuck did you give me the coupon? I guess these guys are high at work and the manager is rude. 0 stars"}
{"text":"I like that this location serves favorites and always posts their seasonal options on big signs that are easy to read. Friendly staff just a little slower than most. The best things in life are worth waiting for I guess. Always good for a once-in-awhile treat but could see some improvements for the future."}
{"text":"My shake was not made how I originally ordered it. When it was remade, It was so thin it was basically milk with some topping. No one was at the front when I was walked in and had to wait for the drive thru person to actually see me."}
{"text":"The female working the drive thru should be fired. We waited in line awhile for the order in front of us. When I got to the window our cones were sitting there melting. I asked for a fresh cone and she gave me an argument. When I insisted on it, she shoved it into my hand and slammed the window shut. Too bad she's having a bad night, or is it just a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Hot, sweaty, oppressive.  Three words that best describe the June climate in Charlotte - and the locals were saying the June weather is typical August weather.  Note to self - never go to Charlotte in August.  But if you're cranky from the heat, or just need a treat, DQ is your best bet.  We hit up this location on a Saturday evening and it was packed - classic car hot rod guys, families, and sweating-buckets outta-towners.  It took a while to get up to the one window that was taking orders and a bit to get it, but damn was it worth the wait once you did.  The crew behind the counter was chatty and hilarous.  Lots of fun to watch them bark orders at one another.  Same priced as any other DQ, of couse my pal Ben ordered a Blizzard with every possible mix-in turning into the most expensive, medium-sized, ice cream thingy ever so I made him promise me it would be the best Blizzard ever and if he got an ice cream headache he'd have to eat it faster.  Good folks, good treats."}
{"text":"Just got a Royal Oreo Blizzard. What made it royal was it had caramel in it. Was told its 70 cents more because it is a Royal Blizzard. Got home and started eating it and there was about 1/2 teaspoon of caramel in it. And all the chocolate was in one lump at the bottom. Worse Blizzard I have ever eaten and ripped off by the price!"}
{"text":"Ice cream is what you would expect from a Dairy Queen. Personally not the best prices around for what you get but sometimes you just need Dairy Queen. Food isn't bad either. I personally enjoy the 5 buck lunch. It's unbeatable."}
{"text":"These homies are as cool as their icecream. We went through the drive-through and not only were the employees patient with us, but once they had our order, they were very fast and made every order perfect to our standards.   My sister got a strawberry shortcake shake, and it was quite fabulous. Every bite was packed with flavor, I'm sure they put more of the stuff in it than icecream. The cup was overflowing, but wasn't dripping, and I appreciated them wiping down the cup for us (sometimes you get a sticky or dirty cup in other places).   I bought a peanut buster parfait and HOLY COW. It is so freakin' good. They make sure to layer the icecream with a nice helping of hot fudge and Spanish peanuts. So every bite has the perfect mix.   Again, the service was great. I can tell that the employees take pride in a job well done.   TIPS & TRICKS:  * As good as the peanut buster parfait is, it can be slightly overwhelming. Ask for just a hot fudge sundae topped with Spanish peanuts, and you've basically got yourself a tiny, cute version of the parfait.  * Look for them tipping over your shake if you are inside, they prove that their shakes are so thick it won't fall out of the cup. It's kind of their signature thang, and it's kinda fun to secretly hope your icecream will plop on the ground--even though it never does."}
{"text":"We got a smaller sized Large Dip cone and asked the nice guy at the grill about it. He took one look said I am so sorry and made another for us plus let us keep the first too small large dip cone. Ernesto was so great!!! Thank You!   I read some of the horrible reviews and wondered if they could have gotten a very positive result with a pleasant inquiry?   I have to say I was very satisfied with everything once we allowed Ernesto to make it right;)"}
{"text":"Messed up order, and didn't care enough to fix it. The reviews speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Not too much to look at but the staff have always been very friendly and quick. Can't beat a Dairy Queen Blizzard.."}
{"text":"As DQ is a national chain, my rating is based upon how I feel it stacks up against other Dairy Queens.   Whoa. 5 stars?  Let me set the scene. It's a hot summer evening, you're coming back home to the south hills and think, \"I want ice cream\" and conveniently DQ is on the correct side of the road (unlike Bruster's down the street). But darnit, the place is so packed there's no parking, so you pass it up.  Big mistake.   There is parking, by the way, out back in case you can't get a space in the visible front lot. But you missed out on a chance to get the best blizzard in town...  ... Excuse me, the best? Did I really force my opinion on you like that? Yes I did. You see, this location is the only one I've been to that advertised a cappuccino heath bar blizzard. I've been to many others and received a slack jawed glazed look when I asked for one before being informed that they didn't know what that was. Yet that's precisely what I ordered tonight as well as a banana split for the kids. My order was taken by a fine young gentleman named Tyler who served it upside down just the way I wanted it.  I love Dairy Queen but I've had my share of negative experiences with them over the years (usually with the Flamethrower burger which I used to love) This is one that's never let me down.  You gotta think that when a place is always so packed it's gotta be good, and this is no exception."}
{"text":"It deserves no stars, horrible customer service and they messed up my order. I wanted to call corporate but a younger blonde girl says they are not allowed to give out names. I'm upset with a very rude elderly man. I will never return to a DQ again after this experience and I will tell all my friends about this very unpleasant experience"}
{"text":"whenever i visit this location my ice cream is always runny and melted. it took me less than 5 min. to drive home after ordering a banana split and by the time I was home it was melted. this locations sucks.  the one on Gilbert between Elliot and Guadalupe is much better. Never had problems there."}
{"text":"I love going to this dairy Queen on 88 on my way to Walmart,  I try to stop here once a week or every other week. It's clean and the parking is good. Always customers in and out of there so they are pretty steady, and I got to know the morning workers, Charlene and Fran, what a team they are, they are both so sweet and helpful,  you could tell they work good together, so give it a try and say hi to char and fran the work the day shift. They don't have fried foods, just the basics but that's not why we go to dairy Queen right??????"}
{"text":"I waited to give a review for this place until I had been back a few times just to be fair. I go through the drive-through here periodically and I keep thinking each time I go back it might be better but it seems to only get worse. The employees are always standing around and dont acknowledge their customers, and when I was at the drive-through window I could see a bunch of trash all over the floor. This location is not clean at all, and I will not be returning. If management sees this, I'm begging you please fix this so you don't lose any more business. In the meantime, I will be finding somewhere else to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to DQ for some blizzards for dine in.  First of all it was 104 outside and they didn't have the air conditioner on. It was so freaking hot in there.  Then after we waited over 20 mins to find out the ice cream machine wasn't working. It'll be awhile before we go back. There's plenty of choices around."}
{"text":"Super small interior. Can't hold probably that 10 people. But my review today is based on the experience I had in the drive thru. I ordered a blizzard and a funnel cake. And for some odd reason the cashier put the blizzard in the bag with my hot funnel cake. So as I drive off and l proceed  to take the blizzard from the bag, the lid comes off and ruins everything ."}
{"text":"Horrible service! 6 people working! Waiting now 20min for a blizzard and an orange julious. This is sad and I highly advise the owner to come see what your store looks like and retrain your staff. Maybe even get a lead or manager that has some leadership qualities. The blizzard area is disgusting !! Every surface is covered in mess. Really disgusting!!"}
{"text":"SQUEE. I love ice cream. I love Dairy Queen. I love Dairy Queen ice cream.  Mainly I visit this for the oh-so-close-to-home Blizzard craving that comes about, but their non-ice cream food is good too.  I always receive stellar service here with nothing less than a smile.  Quick, too.  Oreo mint Blizzard = heavenly.  They also have like, 4 sizes now too - I'm so glad they started offering that!  You can have your sweet tooth in a Kids' or Mini size.  As Goldilocks would say, \"Juuuust right.\""}
{"text":"Sadly I have to give this location a 1 star due to the poor customer service/attitude of the kids that work here. Been in twice and both times the group of kids that work here make myself and my family uncomfortable. Today was National Ice Cream Cone day, so I was hoping for some smiles or a \"thank you for coming, or come again\" just zero chance. Maybe management will read the reviews and revisit the employees they have working the front counters."}
{"text":"I Iike soft serve and soft serve with a chocolate shell on it .... yum  Oh and nice folks and a decent price."}
{"text":"Still a good place! Today I had the BLT Salad with a lite Italian dressing and ice tea. It was really good!  And of course the staff is happy and friendly!"}
{"text":"Beautiful service and an amazing deal for some gud ice cream and a burger its cheap."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most dysfunctional DQ in the phoenix area. My wife and I came in and ordered two medium shakes. The six separate customers who came in and ordered after us received their orders, ate and left while we were still waiting. 20 minutes later we were still waiting. We asked to speak to a manager and no one would step up and try to resolve our issue. I get that  it's high school kids working there, but I think they should fire everyone and start with new people. I'm not a huge DQ fan, but I guarantee that I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Seriously this is the bomb for a snickers blizzard! The best I've ever had! The customer service is excellent! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The sandwich wouldn't have been so bad if they managed to cook the bacon... It was completely raw."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible place. To work or to be a customer. Manager is always on her phone watching Netflix and tells employees to put their phones in the safe even when they aren't being used. Employees threatening other employees. Very dirty. No one cleans anything well. Also owner is worried about the wrong things, telling employees to act like a celebrity to walked in to the store, but never mind the mold growing in the drain in the lobby.  Too much favoritism by manager and owner. There was also mold growing in the soda fountain in lobby. Do not work or eat here, Ever!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch (Rural and Elliot). Asked for a hamburger lunchbox but got a cheeseburger. I told the gentleman that I asked for a hamburger and he proceeded to tell me they only come in cheeseburgers so if I wanted the correct order I needed to learn how to order. He stated I needed to ask for a cheeseburger with no cheese. My reply was, well isn't that what a hamburger is? If I had ordered incorrectly I would have understood the attitude and tone but I did ask for a hamburger. So, while the others in my party ate I waited for my hamburger. No big deal. The gentleman I was with asked who the manager of the store was and he replied\" me\", laughed and started to walk away. He stopped him and asked what his name was, twice, before he got an answer (Ahmed). It wasn't until then that he dropped the attitude and actually started being nice.When I got my hamburger I picked it apart to be sure it was ok. I work in the customer service industry and I would never speak to a customer with a condescending attitude, I would get dismissed immediately no questions asked. I am spending money in his establishment... Needless to say I won't be going there again. I really can't believe that he thinks he could speak to anyone like that. He obviously isn't management material, maybe Dairy Queen should send him to some classes or get someone older with a little more experience. No stars for this one, sorry."}
{"text":"I'm only rating my last visit, but they were great. Burly Latino guy took our order, good personality, brought out our order. Hot food was hot, cold was cold. Same guy was later seen cleaning tables. It was refreshing to actually get good service."}
{"text":"Blizzards are an all time favorite of mine, this DQ will actually still turn it upside down for you when it's made, pretty cool a lot of branch's stopped doing this but I enjoy it because it reminds me of when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Not sure why this DQ is getting such bad reviews. I've never had a problem when coming here, although I've only ordered ice cream and desserts and have yet to order actual food here. There's never a line/crowd when I come here and I always get my order quickly. The ice cream is so creamy and delicious and my go to is a medium vanilla cone which is huge!"}
{"text":"Need to update their hours. They advertise that they are open till 12 on Saturday but they close at 11."}
{"text":"This is a basic Dairy Queen - not the grillin' variety.  (Surprised at all the no-hamburgers-here-hate on Yelp.)  I've never gone to a DQ for grilled meats, so the lack of burgers here didn't bother me.    I do go to a DQ for a Blizzard, and they do 'em right here.  Mine was thick and tasty, filled with all the oreos they could possibly fit in that container. ;)  Service was quick and friendly, late on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever. Stopped by on the way to the airport and decided to hit the DQ since it was next door.  No greeting. No, \"I'll be with you in a minute.\" They messed up 1 drive thru orders. This franchisee should turn in his keys! Unfortunate that one star is the lowest a half would be too much."}
{"text":"This is my favorite DQ in the valley. The restaurant is always clean and the service has always been friendly. I try to get a different blizzard now and again. But Grandma's favorite treat was always the cherry dipped cone. I love to come as a treat on a hot summer day, I tried their food a few times, but honestly prefer their ice cream the best."}
{"text":"Yes Dairy Queen ,an American Favorite. Everyone loves DQ!  Though over the years the lce Cream has changed, but what has not. It is a cheap place to go , to get some old time fav's! The Dilly bars and Buster Bars are still around and still pretty good. Though I would like a little more fudge on it. The place is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. So very much worth a stop in."}
{"text":"This will be simple. They are drive thru, it's a great staff, they are a little slow but they give a delicious product worth the wait lol. My favorite is anything with cherries and chocolate!!"}
{"text":"Look. I know it's Dairy Queen.. who yelps Dairy Queen? But this place is the worst customer service. Screwed up my order once before. I ordered a 6 piece no toast extra fry sauce (willing to pay - I told the guy) when I got home no fry sauce, 3 pieces of chicken and when I called the guy acted as if I was trying to get something for free.  2nd time I was trapped in the drive through for 22 minutes. No lie. When I got to the window the lady didn't have my order, no idea what my order was and when she could tell I was upset she just laughed at me. Tonight I figured 3rd times a charm.. nope. Guy taking the order was rude, he asked if I was \"ready to order\" I replied \"ready when you are\" and he responded \"well I just asked for your order - obviously I'm ready\" like.. wtf? Never eating at a Dairy Queen again - really going to miss that fry sauce."}
{"text":"Awful! Looks family owned with a lot of family working but it seems they stand around while making the \"worker bee's\" do all the work. I went in for a quick Sundae. The cashier was working his tale off. Taking orders. Delivering food. Bussing tables. Just working hard. There was clearly a disconnect here because the bosses seemed to push him hard, be disappointed in what he was doing, while standing around and basically doing nothing but bitching and complaining. The aura sucked the life out of me and I can't imagine why I'd not only go back to this DQ but any DQ because this is the 4th time I've walked into a franchisee of the DQ family only to walk out either dirty or cheated."}
{"text":"Super disappointed that the new DQ can't make their signature blizzard correctly. I ordered a strawberry cheesecake blizzard with extra cheesecake and got a pulverized strawberry cheesecake flavored ice cream milk shake?? Smoothest texture, no chunks of fruit and cake like all their photos, so I guess these guys haven't checked out their own menu or have quality check. I literally took one bite and threw it away, and wished I would have just gone to Fry's and paid less to not satisfy my craving. Sad I wasted time driving,  waiting. Hopefully they can figure it out."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had I sat in the drive through for over 15 minutes and all I ordered was two blizzards and when I got to the window I wanted w drink now that I was thirsty from sitting when I got handed a drink with no ice. The manager took 5 minutes to come to the window. If I would have done something like that where I work I would have been fired."}
{"text":"We used the drive thru today at 4:50 and order a med salted Carmel truffle and a med  Jurassic chomp. What we wound up with were 2 salted Carmel's.  As we drove home we noticed one of the cups had a hole in it and was leaking due to the hot day all over my cup holder. Further inspection when we got home looked like someone's long nails may have punctured the cup. Gross. Threw it out aswho knows what could be under that nail."}
{"text":"Never come here on a very hot day on a Saturday afternoon. Expect long lines. Very long lines. I've never visited this Dairy Queen and was surprised it was here, as I have passed it a few times and never realized it was there. I'm used to more updated buildings, signage, etc. After waiting for about 25 minutes to order and receive food, we received our food and were on our way. I ordered a large chocolate chip cookie dough blizzard with extra cookie dough and really enjoyed it. It was prepared perfectly. They forgot the extra cookie dough, but quickly added it once they were notified that it was missing."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Picking up a cake and had lunch here. Lovely staff!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru ordered a waffle bowl and a blizzard. After telling to guy 3 different time what I wants they still got my order wrong. When I went in to get the correct blizzard they guy acted like he didn't speak very good English, and said nope it's right and walked off. Staff was rude and a terrible experience. I will be driving up to Olympian drive from now on for my DQ."}
{"text":"Warning- they will always ask you if you want extra topping on your blizzard!! Then they never give you any extra topping. I love blizzards but I'm never going back to this place.  If you must get a blizzard here don't pay for the extra topping !! It's a trick.   Also I called in after a couple visits because I was fed up and asked that they make me a real blizzard or give me some more butterfinger but the girl refused."}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will ever be going to this Dairy Queen location. I ordered blizzards and when I got up to the window the lady took my card and then told me the total. The total was too low for what I ordered and before I could say anything she disappeared. At this point she wasn't frustrated, so the drive-thru window closed nicely. When she comes back she hands me the receipt and my card and then tries to hand me a large drink. I hand it back to her and tell her that this is not what I ordered. She takes the drink back and just looks at me. I then repeat what I ordered and she apologizes, but this time slams the window closed and then disappears again.  She comes back and tells me that since she charged me for the wrong drink the remaining balance for the blizzards is due. I hand her my card again. She tells me that she will get the blizzards and then slams the drive-thru window again. She comes back and hands me the blizzards and doesn't say a word. She doesn't say \"have a nice day\" or anything. She just slams the window again and then turns her back to me until I drive away. Before pulling into traffic, I checked the blizzards. You know how they can turn the cup upside down and it won't be melted? Well this would not have been the case. I wish I would have had her test the blizzards by turning them upside down before taking them, because they would have spilled all over the place. I am not super picky on the blizzards being somewhat melted, but this \"ice cream\" was so melted I could have used a straw to drink it."}
{"text":"The blizzard of the month, Chocolate Candy Shop, is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow this place still have chocolate ice cream the staff there pretty quick on get your food and get what you ordered. The staff here at Dairy Queen is very friendly smiling. Thanks for enjoyable visit not many places do this anymore."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the customer service was decent enough. Staff was friendly but the place was a mess and not one worker was using gloves, which would have been fine if the employee preparing the food didn't keep touching her face and putting her hands pretty much in the cups. When we were handed our blizzards the young man who handed them to us touched the ice cream without gloves right after he had just finished handling money, and he definitely did not wash his hands. We ended up throwing the blizzards away and will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Drove through this one today determined to try one of the thick yellow Lemonade's I always see advertised. I ordered a large and drove up to the window. What I got was a solid white concoction and very watery. I took a sip and not only was it barely cool in temperature, but tasted like a solid block of sugar. No lemon to be found anywhere, and certainly not the thick cold looking drink advertised.  I knocked on the drive thru window repeatedly as the girl who waited on me had closed it, for what seemed like an eternity. When she finally came to the window with a disdainful look on her face asking what I wanted.  I explained the issue and not only did she not offer to remake it, she seemed pissed that I had a beef. When I suggested an Orange Julius instead or something comparable, she only pointed out the higher price difference. I then asked for a large diet soda, which she obliged but didn't bother to refund the difference in price. (I should have got back at least .40 cents) Clearly the advertised product and what you will find waiting for you at the window are two different things. I guess what made me the most dissatisfied is her complete lack of interest in giving me what I paid for, and essentially a \"what do you want me to do about it\" attitude. Does this place even have a manager? I wonder. Clearly customer service is not something they strive for here. And management if you're reading this, here's a tip; If you're going to advertise a THICK, COLD, LEMON drink, you need to deliver. What was handed to me today was pathetic, not to mention the crappy customer service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Skimped on ice cream. Their version of a \"large\" hot fudge sundae is ridiculously small. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly. One of the newer stores. I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch. I thought it was very a very good sandwich and I especially liked the bun that it was on. Could have taken a picture but I already ate it."}
{"text":"Place was extremely busy drive threw forget about it.  We had to go inside where the staff looked busy and working hard. Customer service was ok as there was one cashier that her tone you could tell she was tired. The inside was a bit dirty but I am sure with all the traffic inside it was a bit cleaner when they started. Our order was prepared fast and looked just like the pictures so overall I would say they did a great job."}
{"text":"It upsets me that this DQ is only 3 stars, friendly staff, I'm not here often although I wish I could be. This is a family favorite and has been here for YEARS! I remember being young and coming here to celebrate after dance recitals with my team. I love blizzards!"}
{"text":"Stopped there tonight to get blizzards for myself and my family.  The lady working the drive though window needs to go take a few customer service classes before working in a job like this.  She was so unpleasant. Unfortunately this is the closest dairy Queen to us.  Would consider driving further away just to get better service.  My husband said well isn't she just a ball of sunshine.  Hope nobody else has to get such awful service."}
{"text":"First time in this DQ! And was awesome! The gentleman behind the counter took time to answer questions and explain that at this location, the bars are made in store. Which is really cool. My Blizzard was prefect. Oh, and I like the waving Ice Cream out on the street! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The busiest DQ I have been to in a long time and even though the ice cream and service were fine, I can't bring myself to even give an average score to a place that has a parking lot that induces not one... not two... but three near physical altercations over such a poorly designed parking set up. We almost left before getting anything. It was terrifying just walking to the door."}
{"text":"Solid DQ. Had a delicious blizzard served by a pleasant counter person. No reason not to enjoy a little soft serve deliciousness here!"}
{"text":"Drive thru was quite busy so we decided to go inside. There were about five people in line but we asked the girl about the royal peanut butter cup blizzard and she had to ask someone what was in it. I think some training is needed as you should know this when asked. We waited 20 minutes for our two blizzards. Now, I thought the DQ Blizzard thing was upon giving it to the customer, they flip it upside down to show that it stays in the cup. Guess what, they didn't do that because it was already 1/2 melted. We got home, 2 min away, opened the top and it proceeded to drain all over the counter and it's now sitting in our freezer waiting to harden. Never again DQ, we'll stick to baskin Robbins on Decatur and yogurtland."}
{"text":"Was here and had a Birthday BOGO offer.  Emily was extremely helpful in recommending us a drink and was very friendly.  Would go back here again because of the great service.  The drink was really yummy.  My little one didn't even want to share because he loved it so much.  Good thing I had one for him and one for me."}
{"text":"I went to this DQ in Tuscola with my Wingman and the Chicken Strip Basket were excellent and the candy cane blizzard was good. We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I actually just came to Yelp today to look up this Dairy Queen in particular just to see if the hours were listed and I felt such a sense of camaraderie with everyone else who reviews this location.  I love Dairy Queen and mine is a house of fast food junkies who love dessert, but going to THIS Dairy Queen is generally not even worth it.  Every time I think about going I get this uncomfortable feeling in my stomach because I know I have to deal with rude, snotty brats if I want ice cream, but the nearest one other than this one isn't terribly convenient.    The demon's spawn that work here range from completely disinterested to straight up rude.  There is no care given to the items made, they are distracted by their coworkers, they don't greet you in a friendly manner at all, and you generally feel like you're an inconvenience.  You cannot blame it on them \"just being teens\" either because kids work at Taco Bell, Del Taco, In & Out, Wendy's, Subway, etc and they are friendly and helpful 99% of the time at any given location.  But I suppose if the owner is an ass and doesn't care, then why should the staff?  I hope the owner reads this just so they realize how much money they lose by not taking their business seriously."}
{"text":"Super irritated with the lady working the counter. Maybe she didn't hear me when I said hello since her glaring stare pretty much started the 2 min interaction extremely uncomfortable. Or maybe it was the question I had about the blizzard that confused her to state at me yet again in complete dismay but oh my do I never want to see this lady again. Either she was incredibly out of it or she was just THAT rude...whatever the case never want to see her again.  Darn too cuz we love the blizzards."}
{"text":"I went to this Dairy Queen today for the \"buy one blizzard, get one for 99 cent\" promotion. I ordered two blizzards and was charged full price. Confused I looked around and ensured the sign was there for the deal, since I know some locations don't do the promotions. The sign was there so I asked the employee why I didn't get the deal. The employee said I had to ask for it at the time of purchase. That is ridiculous. I don't blame the employee, I blame who they get their orders from. The franchisee clearly has issues with poor management (as you can also tell by the many obnoxious, typed signs they have all over the location). My guess based on my experience and other reviewers is that this franchisee tells their employees to avoid giving discounts as much as possible. VERY POOR MANAGEMENT and not how to retain customers. Get your treats somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The only reason I stopped at this Dairy Queen location is because I was putting gas in my car and DQ was beside the gas station.  This place is convenient since they offer a drive-thru. I was hankering for a sweet after dinner dessert and a mini blizzard was the perfect treat.  I opted for the salted caramel truffle blizzard. It's just the right size to indulge in without feeling too guilty.  Luckily for me, there was only a short line up that moved fairly quickly. However, I can envision problems getting out of the parking lot if the DQ drive-thru line gets busy."}
{"text":"I recently had an experience that will cause me to never spend a dime at this location. My boyfriend has a serious ice cream addiction, literally 5 days a week he comes to this location and orders the SAME THING! A Dr Pepper freeze with strawberries... our daughter will get one too if she's there. Today, the lady at the window is persistent that there's no way they can do this and he can't get it. No way to add strawberries? Lol ok! Not only was she rude at the speaker, she was talking crap to the car in front of us and then basically tried to shoo us off! Hey Amy, (if that's even your real name) I know you are proud claiming you've worked there for 7 years but it's only strawberries! Thanks for making a big deal about nothing!"}
{"text":"I was just thinking today, as I was waiting in the drive thru, that I needed to make sure to write a positive review for this DQ. They're always efficient and respectful. The food is fresh. The owner seems to show great pride in his/her business.  Then I got home. We ordered a chicken strip basket with two gravy's. I usually ask them to check to make sure both gravy's are included. This time I didn't. Not only did they leave out the extra gravy that was paid for, but the one cup they did include was less than half full and it had clearly been sitting for awhile. So disappointed. Proves the point we shouldn't be eating fast food!!"}
{"text":"I was craving a Blizzard sooooo bad and decided to feed my craving. They definitely always get my order right and they are quick and friendly. My only (2) complaint is that their menu is a bit small. I was kinda craving the chicken strip basket and they don't have that. I didn't know if its because its also an Orange Julius...?  Also, they don't have a drive thru. With that being said, I will return again if I'm craving my Blizzard."}
{"text":"This location is awful! They literally forget half my order every single time. If you are really craving DQ, go to another location."}
{"text":"came here after dinner with some friends.   main issue is:  i think the owner (an asian dude) was wearing crocs without socks while making and serving food.    the portions were generous, my blizzard was overflowing. awesome. but then while we were eating we all got this whiff of ASS. i looked at my friends and they looked at me like \"did you do it?\" finally we looked over at the only other people who were an old couple a few tables away from us and they looked over at us like \"do you smell that?\" finally we all started laughing and said it must be their sewer pipe or something. we already finished our stuff but overheard the wife of the elderly couple say \"ugh... how can you eat that with that smell?\" hahaha we all got up and left. everyone was laughing while we walked out the door."}
{"text":"An oreo blizzard for the kiddo and a chocolate sunday for myself.  On a hot day in the sun, this seems to top of a great day just nicely.  It also appears we were not the only one with this idea since the place seemed fairly busy.  The staff was very attentive and accomodating, so I think we will find ourselves back here again soon.  Nothing is better than icecream on a hot day"}
{"text":"Ordered the frosted fudge brownie blizzard and my hubby the blonde blizzard. When we got our ice cream she didn't flip them. (Shoulda called her on it). Both of our blizzards are just vanilla and chocolate chips. I paid 5 bucks each for something that I didn't order."}
{"text":"Came to try their $5 buck lunch box...I will sick to just their ice cream because the food was not good."}
{"text":"The soft serve was tasty as always, but it was leaning to the side, and the 'curlicue' on top wasn't rocking that Dairy Queen look.  5 for the taste, but only 3 due to sloppy execution (come on, DQ - that's your signature!)"}
{"text":"This is a great location. The staff are friendly and work quickly to get orders out. Sometimes it can take a bit longer, but that is only because it gets busy and people are ordering hot and cold food. Cakes also look nice."}
{"text":"I hate rating chains, but this gem deserves a mention. I have been to this location twice in the past week during lunch. There's usually just one lady working, who is super sweet and friendly. When I got there today, there was no one else in the restaurant, however she was on the phone. I waited about a minute, and she took my order.  I ordered three snack wraps and fudge stuffed cookie. It took about 15 minutes for me to receive my food. I think I've received faster service at Applebee's. It's definitely not what you'd expect at a fast food restaurant. I will mention that two parties came in after me, which probably made her nervous. The wraps were fine, but the fudge stuffed cookie looked nothing like the photo. The cookie is supposed to be whole, but for some reason she cut it in half. It was also overcooked.   They definitely need to work on properly staffing this location, and then I'm sure it'd be up to DQ standards. Until then, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Visited on a busy Saturday night and the 3 teens working the lobby were very friendly. The cashier had a great attitude and seemed chipper despite the fact that they were slammed.   The inside seemed clean and the outside landscaping was very pretty!"}
{"text":"Lord oooooh lord... please help the young gentlemen that works here. I don't know if he was not paying attention or is just not using common sense but it did not make me want to come back.  Having a bad day at work... Parent yelling at me over billing... Biteds happening let and right... I was on a dessert kick and needed it stat. Driving over to the local DQ I was getting a banana split for me and a blizzard for my friend.  \"Can I have a banana split? Only chocolate syrup on top please, not all three pictured\" Response: \"Uhhh, so chocolate syrup?\" I said yes whatever that delicious chocolate stuff is on top\" Response again, \"Uhhh, so hot fudge?\" This is where i got annoyed \"I want whatever comes on the banana split chocolate wise just NOT the red syrup or yellow one in the picture.   \"What else can I get for you?\" He said. I was getting a knot in my stomach and it wasnt because of my appetite. I knew I was about to have another issue again. \"Can I get a cookie dough blizzard please\" Response: \"Okay\" Wow, that was simple. Dun Dun dun.  As he hands me my desserts he says, \"Here's your cookies and cream blizzard\" Oh lordy... \"No I wanted Cookie dough\". response again, \"Oh I don't think we have it\" I knew theyhad it because I've ordered it many times before and this man was not going to get between me and my two desserts. \"Can you go check\" When he finally came back he stated\" Oh sorry we do have it, I thought you wanted cookies and cream\"  By the time I got the blizzard I was afraid he might have done something to it so I decided to skip it and just eat the banana split then gave the blizzard to a coworker. Hehe"}
{"text":"I think 99% of America knows the menu at DA so I am basing the rating on service. Having a drive thru for ice cream and standard fast food is a novel idea IF the young kids working the drive thru actually paid attention to your order. The past four occasions I went thru the drive thru, my order was messed up. Before anyone passes judgement telling me to shorten my order, I'd like to add that it was one food item - ice cream. That's it. For example, peanut butter bash with twist ice cream. I received a peanut buster parfait with vanilla. Blizzard....twist ice cream, pb sauce, and oreos. I got heath bar pieces and caramel. Wtf!  The most recent experience, I was with my parents so there were 3 items total. As I was saying peanut butter baaaa....the girl interrupted me telling me my total. I had to ask if she was ready for the next two items I needed at which point a \"Huh?\" Came into the speaker. For real? Followed by a sighhhhhh. I'm sorry, did I mess up your system by YOU not giving me a chance to speak? Disrespectful. Btw, that was the mixup with the pb bash/peanut buster parfait.  Cold stone, and Rita's are great alternatives at this point."}
{"text":"Very bad and very slow service.  I opted to go somewhere else because of the service and not so friendly employees.  Thankfully other DQs know how to be friendly and can quickly and accurately fill customer orders"}
{"text":"I've stopped through this DQ throughout the years when I craved an Oreo Blizzard or the double cheeseburger meal. The thing I would say is that this location has never gotten my order wrong. And if you know fast food joints, you know that almost NEVER happens.   I would also note that despite the fact that they can sometimes be a bit slow at this location, they always have given me fresh and hot food. Nothing ever feels like it has been sitting. Even the fries are always piping hot.   As far as the location goes I would say that the drive thru is cramped and coming out on to Central Ave to Missouri Road headed northbound can be a major challenge. Sometimes I've had to go through the neighborhood to get to the next light because northbound AND southbound Central Avenue can be hectic during the day (and even at night).   One final note, the employees always are young. Which means they aren't perfect. However, they are ALWAYS friendly and get my order right. And that's what I judge them on.   Bravo teen DQ kids, OWN that summer job! Lol"}
{"text":"The guy working tonight: Wed. Aug. 6, 2014 around 9 p.m. (after the movie \"Lucy\" let out), was insulting and rude. He lost your business 1-sale tonight and MANY sales in the future. I simply needed a glass of milk. I've been feeling off all day and it's comforting. He made fun of my choice. (Whatever, dude!!) He was unsure if they SOLD MILK AT DAIRY QUEEN!? It's first name is Dairy... Just saying. I politely asked if he'd please check when he was done with (whatever he was doing). He gave me a head-nod (meaning: yes we've got milk)... Then he turned and started on the elderly couple (who also knew I was first, but they are jerks too). I didn't appreciate his crappy attitude or his opinion about my drink choice. I travel often to Vegas, specifically to the Aliante. This guy just blew it bigtime!!   Who is laughing now? Hmmm Johnny Rockets right nearby had no problem helping me with some cold milk! Thanks Johnny Rocket!!"}
{"text":"We've gotten multiple blizzards here and often ask for extra toppings but they barely put any toppings in and it's all mixed up at the top so the bottom half is always just plain ice cream.  Very annoying exp when you pay extra for more toppings and they seems to give less instead of more."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped at the Dairy Queen on central on our way home. I got the pumpkin pie blizzard. I was giddy like a school girl. There were tiny hairs all over my entire blizzard. It was repulsive. I will never go there again, and this is depressing, because Dairy Queen in Philly was a high school hang out for me."}
{"text":"Too bad we can't give negative stars. This dq failed miserably today. Ordered kids cheeseburger plain. It didn't come plain. Ordered a cheeseburger no onions. Came with onions. Both locations in the south, rainbow and so highlands just cannot get it right. Done with Dairy Queen forever."}
{"text":"We've been in with the kids a few times and for DQ had ok service. What really stuck out and warranted the review was the young man behind the counter. I don't remember his name but he had blonde hair. I stopped with my daughter after a trip to the park for lunch followed by ice cream. We ordered a hot dog, fries and small cone, I paid with my card and as we took our number she said dad did you get my cup? Dang, I forgot to order a drink and or assumed I had got a meal with it included, the young man heard her and asked if we wanted to order a drink, I said yes and reached for my wallet. He stopped me and said I've seen you guys a few times and we appreciate your business the drink is on us. BOOM, something so simple takes average trips to DQ and made it a game changer. The other drive thru reviews seem bad but we've had good luck twice going inside"}
{"text":"Classic dairy queen. Kids working are always friendly. Everything is always fresh made. You can't really complain about the place. Its been there forever. Could use a little updating."}
{"text":"WORST experience of my life!   It's a shame you must leave a positive rating.  A negative rating should be added in Yelp.  Seriously.    Do not go to this Dairy Queen!     I'm still in shock!    I called this shop to find out about getting a ice cream cake for my son's birthday.   I spoke to a person who later was first to serve me when I drove to the shop 10 min. later.   He was knowledgeable, friendly, & did a great job with personalizing the cake.  Then another guy came out and rang out the total on the cash register.   I asked about purchasing 10 gift cards as well.  He entered all the cards in and proceeded to ask \"Would you like to pay for the candles?\".   I answered \"What?\"   He asked the same question again.  I then responded by saying \"What candles?\".  Deeply confused as I was thinking was there a picture of candles on the cake.   Then he said \"The candles in your backpack?\".   This was repeated.   I said \"I don't have candles in my backpack?!Are you accusing me of taking candles?\"     He said \" I thought you had candles in your bag\".   I was mad.    I asked his name.    It was Michael.  Shocked but irate now,   I said you said you should be fired for accusing a customer of stealing.   He apologized but always looked down.   Then girl that was helped put the gift cards together said he has to go check the camera.     I was appalled.    Bloody f%cki#g unbelievable!!    I pulled my credit credit out of the machine and said cancel this order!   I walked out.   All 4 staff have disappeared into the back of the store.   I paced around outside the store and called my husband to to tell him the story.   It's almost 11PM and the store is going to close.  Our party is at 10AM in the morning and all DQs open at 11AM.  He says to just get the cake and have Michael fired afterwards.   The bloody sh#t we do for our kids!!   I go back in and buy the flippin' cake and gift cards.  I don't know the exact total as no receipt was put into the bags.      I'm disgusted by this shop.    No wonder retail is fading!    This may be my last shop to DQ.   I also bought a bunch of DQ gift cards for loot bags.   What do I do with these now?  I'm not going to encourage my friends and family to patronize DQ.    Thank goodness I bought Chapters/Indigo cards earlier.     Please do yourself a favour and Yelp \"Check In\" at another Etobicoke DQ.  I'm certain your experience will be better than at this location!"}
{"text":"love this location. its not the fastest but quality is always good. how's all these dudes on here giving 3 stars because I've cream is unhealthy?! yeah bring down the stars on a location because it's not a health food store dummies"}
{"text":"Love this D Q right across the street my my place. They have strawberry malts just like I love."}
{"text":"Ok, so I stopped in for an Oreo Blizzard the other day on my way to Tempe and I found this location to be nice, clean, and friendly. The drive thru is easy enough to navigate, plus there is a ton of parking at this location.   It is easy to miss though because it doesn't necessarily stand out as you are driving along Scottsdale Road. The outdoor seating is nice though and there is plenty of it. There's not much else for me to say about this location, other than it is a nicer DQ and it's friendly.   God bless Dairy Queen. 4-stars!"}
{"text":"I understand that this is a fast food restaurant but whenever I have gotten a sandwich from them, I've had to send it back for them to remake. Their sandwich look as if it had been thrown together and then they played baseball with it. I've had them remake sandwiches for me twice now."}
{"text":"I went to DQ last summer twice now and after getting coupons sent to my home, I would try to use it; but when I go there, there smoothie machine never works and weeks later I go back and they still didn't get it to working. I called up Customer Relation right after the second time of going there and they said they emailed me but yet have not found anything on it; then I called again before I go up there being I got another updated coupon and I wanted to see why I didn't get responded to. They made another report for someone to call me but I never got a call to show concern or apology when getting their coupons at this location. That's pretty shame when they're doing business but don't know if they're getting burnt out or losing more help or what? But why they keep sending me coupons if I can't use it closeby?"}
{"text":"They have closed this location.  To bad because I'll miss it.  The parking was terrible but I dealt with it since I hate drive throughs."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with a Dairy Queen chocolate dipped cone.  I'll confess, the special waffle cone bowl sundae with strawberry and hot fudge was pretty tempting, but...call me a creature of habit (go ahead, I dare ya!)"}
{"text":"Yes, Town Square has a dairy queen on the first floor underneath Blue Martini and next to Yard House on the first floor. Friendly staff and a plethora of dessert items to choose from. I like the monthly blizzard options. They just keep doing what they know best and that's good service + food. The people that own this location also own many in town, which is good because the people they hire are consistent. Each time I have been inside of this location, the service has been good."}
{"text":"Good for blizzards when they don't close early. Sadly they've been closed early two out of the last three times I drive over to get after dinner blizzards.  When I leave after dinner to go get blizzards and I don't come home with them my kids cry."}
{"text":"Terrible products. Ordered a reese blizzard and oreo blizzard and couldn't tell because there weren't any pieces of either topping visible in our blizzards. Haven't been to Dairy Queen in 5+ years and won't be returning again any time soon."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP, DQ has the best ice cream cakes ever!!! Picked up a cake for a birthday, worth every penny of the $21.99. I had not ordered one so picked out a log style ice cream cake from inside the glass display case. The young staff behind the counter were literally clueless when it came to any questions. So, I paid and the cake sat in the freezer for 2 painstaking days until the birthday and EAT time! Vanilla, chocolate ice cream with drizzles of chocolate and in the centre, a small lump- treat of chocolate cookie crumbs and fudge. Ohhh Lord!  The place itself was clean and there were a few seats. Worth the wait this cake, worth the cash. Will go back after I work off the calories. It had been a LONG time since my last ice cream cake, like back in the days when my birthday was in the Ronald McDonald caboose!"}
{"text":"This is just about my favorite place for ice cream. I go here different times of the day and always great service. Love the flamethrower burger a must try."}
{"text":"The location on Durango / flamingo is soo much better. This place was out of items we wanted to order.."}
{"text":"This place ( as in this building) is jinxed. This DQ and its predecessors all have one thing in common: Slow service. There could be no cars in the lot, no customers in the drive thru and you will still have to wait as though the place is SLAMMED. Tip: if you choose the drive thru option make sure you have enough gas to wait or just turn your car off and bake in this heat. They also seem pretty overpriced compared to the competition. On the positive side, their blizzards are the bomb and you will pay for that delicious bomb. Food is average at best."}
{"text":"They were swamped when we were there and really were efficient at moving the folks through. The food was good. It was awkward as an older team member came in and was a bit ride busting through the crowd. Then, while in back and in full view, used a towel to pat her face dry. It was busy, maybe help out?"}
{"text":"My banana split craving can get out of hand at times. And Wednesday was one of those nights. Walked in and was greeted right away.. Little man ordered the chicken tenders which he said it taste like any other tenders. I ordered the split of course.. It touch the spot. I asked for peanut topping Not whole peanuts. But I guess they feel the need to do the topping and whole peanuts. Kinda an overkill. The hostess apologized but hey I can pick around it..  This location is fairly clean. Seem like a teenagers hangout. But their drive thru is always busy.. glad it's convenient for me since little man hang out with his cousins and they live nearby!"}
{"text":"Some times there's a bit of a line but good service and what can you say, it's dairy queen!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love ice cream cake?  I wish I had invented it!  Young staff, but the service is always good.  Long lines can be a bummer, but it's an indication of the good job they do.  We've never eaten here, just come for the ice cream and cakes.  Love the Peanut Buster Parfait, too!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to not only were they rude but I sat in the drive-through for 10 minutes for a turkey sandwich and a small orange smoothie and then they were Rude. And to top it all off the food was messy and everywhere"}
{"text":"This place deserves NO stars!   If you would like ice cream cake with hair just call Dairy Queen on Fort Apache.  I ordered a $25.00 ice cream cake for my geanddaughter's birthday party.  Pick up the order, went to the party, we open the box and a huge, long black hair was staring right at us.  My son threw the cake in the trash.  I called and they said I needed to return the cake.  I was out of the area by 40 miles at the party.  A party that now doesn't have a cake.  They refuse to refund my money!   Will Never buy a cake from this filthy place again!  Clean your restaurant! Have your employees wear gloves and hair nets!   The End"}
{"text":"Delightful service this location has plenty of things that make you blow your diet altogether. I've started my diet over now say 6 times and it was all because of the goodness that DQ has to offer. Burgers, soda, Ice cream, shakes, ok I will stop the list because we all have been to DQ before. But the staff are professional the food hot & good. Unless its ice-cream related then its cold and good. I rate it three stars total."}
{"text":"I give it five stars :) The place is clean so I took a picture. But upon each visit their are flies inside the building. I gave a picture of my breakfast also and yes it was sooooo good. Yes, it was worth the drive. But I don't know about eating inside anymore because of the flies. I think I would like to take it to go. The staff are professional, nice and kind. And I give it 5 stars. Because the staff cannot control the flies."}
{"text":"This place is always busy! Thr service could be faster but hey as long as I get my ice cream I am not complaining. I still love the classic cone.  Can't go wrong with chocolate!   I love how they always have different treats coming out."}
{"text":"I will pick soft serve over hard ice cream any day so I really like Dairy Queen. I usually go for a vanilla cone....sometimes with sprinkles...or if I am really treating myself I get the pecan mudslide. I don't see it on the menu anymore but the people here are always happy to make it. I am not impressed with the interior of this place so I always use the drive thru so I don't have to think about it. Sometimes you order, pay, and pick up from the same window, sometimes they send you around the building to pick up. You never know what they are going to want and that can be frustrating as it changes every time. The staff is not overwhelmingly friendly but I have never had them be rude. They tend to keep their heads down and quietly work."}
{"text":"Today i ordered three mini blizzards, and I ended up with a Brownie Cookie Dough blizzard with NO dough in blizzard. It looks as if they used only chocolate syrup mixed with the ice cream. They didn't do the famous DQ \"flip upside down\" to show true thickness of blizzards either, and I can see why because the blizzards were all runny and soft when I received them. I highly recommend going to the DQ on Alma School and Guadalupe instead."}
{"text":"I got a grilled chicken sandwich that looked awesome in the picture. When I got it, it was in a huge box and there were exactly 4 tiny chicken strips, one piece or romaine lettuce the size of my one finger, a spatter of mayo on one sixth of the bread, and the very top slice of a tomato about as big as two nickels. If I hadn't already got onto the highway I would have thrown the sandwich at the cashier. Five dollars or this? I should have gone to McDonald's or Jack in the box across the street. I will never enter another DQ in my life. The is is a poor representation of quality and only shows that it's all about jerking the customer around with false advertising. Not cool"}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago and went through the drive thru. Two cars ahead of me. Got to the speaker and no welcome. Nothing. Radio silence. Say hello multiple times, nothing. Middle of the day, not near closing.. they're open. Saw the cars ahead of me get food. So I pull forward. Stop at the window. Maybe the speaker isn't working. Nothing. No one opens the window. I see people walking around. The girl with the headset. Nothing. What the hell?? Why open if you aren't going to serve people; it's a restaurant, a crappy one but still... ended up just going to tropical smoothie, who greeted me, took my money, and served me; crazy concept. If you're paying these people who work there you should probably stop cause they aren't doing anything. As a manager of a restaurant I'm appalled at this service. Hopefully no one wastes there's time going here; it's trash"}
{"text":"Foods good. Awful atmosphere and building. Awful service - you will wait at least 30mins for a chicken sandwich and notice that no one says thank you.. Not my first time here and it's the same every time."}
{"text":"Asshole!!!! Rude, fat guy did NOT have to be a jerk. Closed for remodeling...that's fine. But don't be a jerk to your customers. You should be fired. There's people in your store (probably friends) during business hours so how are we supposed to know the store is closed. 8:40pm Monday Dec 18th."}
{"text":"Zero stars - over the last 15yrs, I have given this location numerous \"2nd chances\", but they can't seem to get Blizzard recipes correct. Mud Pie Blizzards are my jam, it's been right once. I will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE ice cream/ yogurt fan but yogurtland is TOO crowded for me during the summer, so down the street to here it is! The portions are HUGE, I love that! Its rarely ever crowded and the employees are really polite."}
{"text":"Love this one, it's tucked away, no drive thru. The employees are really nice, especially the young guy at the register, there is an older girl who works that gives everyone a dirty look, can't decide if that's her face or if she's really giving people mean mugs.  medium mint oreo and m&m blizzard for me please!"}
{"text":"pulled up at 930 to watch the businesses lights go off, they closed. the yelp page for this DQ says they're open to 10pm weekdays. very unsatisfied with the incorrect information."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for a quick meal. They will serve fast and of relatively good quality. My only complaint is of poor customer service that I had the time I went there. Along with the lack of air conditioning inside of a ice cream shop."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love DQ? I've been a fan my entire life! But I'm in it for the ice cream, I rarely order from the grill. My go to is the soft serve, usually a cone. But all the ice cream is great. This location is new, very anticipated and busy, busy, busy! So glad they're here!"}
{"text":"Love it but staff needs help. here 1 month ago with a friend and some girl was training and learning...fine. Came back tonight and the same girl is there and still doesn't know what the hell is going on. Poor girl at register was working so hard and had no help"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium caramel oreo cheesequake Blizzards with extra cheesecake through the drive thru on 10/25/2013 at 5 pm. I found a bloody bandaid in my mouth. I assume it came from the blizzard because it was the only thing I was eating at the time. Tony the store manager was very apologetic. He was working that day and remembered me coming through the drive thru. Tony spoke with the owner and he was authorized to offer me a FREE large caramel oreo cheesequake Blizzard to replace the one that had a used band aid in it.   I offered him a FREE large caramel oreo cheesequake blizzard for chewing a bloody bandaid. He declined."}
{"text":"The new owners of this place are great guys and the place is absolutely immaculate.  I make it a point to stop every time I'm in BC and grab a Blizzard or smoothie.  Great service, great location and great DQ treats!"}

But so sad .... this one used to have butterscotch dip for their cones on and off and every time I stop by for myself or a health client I care for or a trip with my kids or grand-boys I ask if they have it back ..I get a young employee who will say to me is a sassy voice No chocolate or cherry I say \"oh man ..you still have not gotten that back \" they will say we have never had it ..i say oh yes you have honey i have come here all my life and they sharply say back well not as long as i have been here .I just want to drive off and go to the Dairy Queen on Scottsdale road and just south of Oak they have butterscotch Dip .. I am so happy to drive 10 miles outa my way just to get a butterscotch Dipped cone ...  Please bring back butterscotch for your Dipped cones  Thank you a sad customer"}
{"text":"They mess up my orders possibly every single time I go. Go to the Dairy Queen further east on Windmill"}
{"text":"It's DQ so it's only so much I can say about it. The food is OK but the staff can take a class or two in public hospitality."}
{"text":"Boooooo! Slow service and can't even give you what you pay for. Manager needs to get his crew together! Loser should be fired."}
{"text":"Have stopped into my localDairy Queen numerous times.  This  Location is clean and efficient. The major employees are young people adults and all of them are friendly and go about trier jobs in a professional manner.  They take the orders and personal my your treat.  They have a wide selection of products. We always  go with the blizzards.  After making our. Lizard they turn it upside down to show how thick the finished product was made.  Just a little showmanship.  Qin plac to is it after dinner or a long da working."}
{"text":"I like Dairy Queen but rest assured I will not return to this location. I came in alongside another couple. They took their time deciding what to order so I placed my order. The two employees lacked customer service skills. It was obvious they did not want to be here. I asked for a number one and both employees literally took a minute to process what I had just said. Then both turn and look at their menu board, very odd and very slow to say the least. I pay for my order. Three more customers come in while I wait. A couple leaves because no one is taking orders, the employees just disappeared to the back. It takes 15 minutes for my order to be ready yet I'm still missing my drink. I ask the girl at the counter for my drink and she looks at me like I'm asking her for a free drink. My combo included a drink which I had to explain to her three different ways. Very, very akward and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This location always seems to have only one employee working, and that employee always seems to be frazzled and stressed.   Also, I've tried 3-4 times over a 6 month period to get chocolate soft serve, only to be told that they are \"out\" and only have vanilla."}
{"text":"You have to be careful what you wish for, I had my usual, peanut  buster parfait, which comes with vanilla ice cream but I asked for it to made with chocolate it was very very yummy."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday on my way home. It was clean and the place had maybe two people inside eating icecream at about 4pm. A family of five walked in the side door and cut in front of me (I was alone). They took forever deciding what they want and so finally another employee came out from the back to help me. He made my Oreo Cheesequake and I went and sat down. Other than the cheesecake peices, it was just \"meh.\" It didn't really have a taste other than cold, if that can be considered a flavor. I was disappointed that I'd spent $3.78 on a small Blizzard, but considering how hot it was yesterday (in the 90s) I am glad I had something to cool off.   Also to be noted, this place sells food other than icecream, but it looks like all they make are hot dogs. And it reminded me of how one would heat up something at a gas station because that's exactly how they cooked the food for the group of five in ftont of me.   I did manage to get a Blizzard card out of the deal so that when I go back (or hopefully find another DQ), I can eventually get a free Blizzard."}
{"text":"The worst Dairy Queen I have ever been to. Walk in and order and as we are waiting, the girl comes out and calls my mint oreo blizzard and starts to take the next order. I asked for a lid and she gives no acknowledgment as she rudely gives me the lid. Being put off by that, the other young lady gives me the other blizzard I ordered and asked for the manager. It was convenient that the manager wasn't available. I asked for the rude employees name and she said her name was GG (as nicknames are professional) and I was given a number to what I thought was the manager. Get home to call for a complaint, and to my surprise, the number that was given to me was not the number of the manager, but the number of the store. The young lady sounded embarrassed as maybe she didn't think I would call. So \"GG\" gets on the phone and very rudely says that they aren't allowed to give the managers number. I asked why they didn't tell me that in the first place instead of lying, and she started to get snappy and I have no time for any nonsense, so I hung up. To add insult to injury, both of the blizzards I ordered had absolutely no flavor. Instead of going to speak to the manager, I thought I would let people know not to visit this dump that hires talentless liars who cannot make a decent blizzard. My advice? Get a clue, be honest, don't hire lying airheads, and renovate the property. Should have walked out when I noticed the store smelled like it wasn't cleaned since the grand opening. Whenever that was."}
{"text":"This is a dairy queen, ice cream and what not. It's all junk food and it tastes great. Really like the corndogs and ice cream. It is slow especially the drive though and this place is packed during the summer."}
{"text":"Thanks to my bestie, I am hooked to death on their chicken strip basket that comes with a mini sundae of your choice!  In fact, just typing this is making me hanker for it.    This is the only DQ close by to my area unfortunately, but it is a big one and very nice.    I must say though, I have found that the younger kids working here seem to hate having t make the DQ trademark coil when they pump out your ice cream.  Not cool!  :-)"}
{"text":"This is the greediest, rude and dirtiest Dairy Queen in the chain.  They give the smallest portions of ice cream for the price, we will not return.  Shame on you.  Totally ripped off a hard working family for their treat out."}

{"text":"We've been coming to this DQ for months once we discovered how delicious the Peanut Buster Parfait was. Tonight we ordered our favorite and served by Andrea through the drive through window. She was incredibly nice and thoughtful. Of course we will keep coming back to this location over and over again! Thanks Andrea!"}
{"text":"This place just opened Saturday. I had a 6 PC spicy chicken strip combo. Came with fries and some toast. The food was good   They have free wifi"}
{"text":"Blizzard was good, however, the girl that rang me up looked like she just got out of bed, hadn't showered, no uniform, and had a nose ring. I know it's likely a minimum wage job but I came into the job world with high expectations of appearance. Leave your sweats at home, wear a uniform, put on a smile, take your face piercings out, and act like you enjoy getting your pay check. The male cashier talked down about a fellow employee to a customer as well. This place really needs someone to get the basics of customer service and customer experience back in even the slightest form. I will likely not return due to the lack of professionalism and horrid appearance of the employees."}
{"text":"Yep it's a Dairy Queen, It's a little busy around 7, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the worse DQ ever!!! The kids working gave attitudes and a obnoxious tip jar!!! Plus their earthquakes are have the size with like a teaspoon of hot fudge! Never coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great tasting. I tried the new bbq pulled pork. The meat was not hot enough. It was like they heated it up a little, then poured cold bbg sauce over it. My table was dirty and the counter in front of the register was dirty. I told the guy behind the counter about it and he apologized but, when I went back up there it was still dirty."}
{"text":"The cashiers are nice but the drive thru is a mess to drive around. If you go inside, the tables are always dirty. I just like to stop by for their cakes when its someone's birthday."}
{"text":"another horrible experience asked for Turtle Pecan Caramel blizzard and both of my blizzards were basically ice cream with pecans no caramel nothing exciting just plain fucking ice cream and fucking pecans...not to mention when getting to the drive thru asking for lids i got the traditional \"ugh\" from the teenage workers, i asked for napkins and got an eyeroll instead so i drove off because half of my blizzard was already melted before i even got to the window but wait the best part of this fucked up blizzard is the part where the blizzard is barely full up to the rim its 3 inches below the rim and it looks like a reservoir of melted ice cream don't let me forget the person sitting on the counter next to the drive thru cashier on an ipad because i guess all you really get to do at work is make ice cream treats and sit on your lazy ass on the ipad all day...to the manager of this place PLEASE TELL YOUR MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS TO TREAT EACH AND EVERY CUSTOMER EQUALLY, THAT MEANS QUIT ROLLING YOUR FUCKING EYES AT CUSTOMERS THATS FUCKING RUDE...STOP USING THAT PATHETIC FUCKING EXCUSE SIGH OF \"UGH\" IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR FUCKING POSITION FURTHER YOUR FUCKING EDUCATION AND FIND A SUITABLE POSITION OUT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake at this location to be picked up back in March and they never received my order when I went to pick it up. They took $3.00 off and the employee said he would let his manager know. I never got a call. We stopped in today to see if the service was any better. It wasn't. I should've know. The girl that took my order Savannah had an attitude when we were asking questions bc my son has a peanut allergy. And there was only one couple behind us with no one seated in the restaurant. Just drive pass this location and go to a different one all together."}
{"text":"Came on customer appreciation day and nicole helped me. She was very nice and quick! My regular Dairy Queen is slow and I have received some poor service but I Might call a manager later to let them know how good and proactive she was!"}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen!!!! I would give five stars if it wasn't for the fact the the server burped in my husband's face and did not apologize.  The lava cake with ice cream was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I normally go to this place on Sundays night and we always dine in, this time we decided for the drive-through because was pouring rain.  We ordered two hot dogs with chilli and cheese and he had a dipped cone and I a vanilla with strawberry ice cream. When we got home we realized that our hot dogs our wrapped on paper and not inside of the hotdog containers. They were soggy and a huge mess, we were very disappointed.  Both ice creams were great. They need to improve the way they pack their to go food."}
{"text":"This place is new but their customer service really needs addressing. The employees look and sound grouchy when they interact with you. No napkins in a to go bag (come on man). I have been going here since their opening and the employees who have been there since day one still seem clueless about what they are supposed to do."}
{"text":"No sense of urgency or customer service at all. The girl that work at 2:40pm on 12/16/16 has the worst customer service ever, no smile no eye contacts. She looks depressed being there by herself and there wasn't that much customers. I work at a fast food restaurant too, so I know the rule, first come first serve, idc how much problems you're going through but my order should come first and before the persons after me. I get it you don't like being there, but It's not that hard to smile and atleast pretend  to be happy serving a paying customer. The furniture  there is so small, it likes for kids only.   I waited 15 mins and wasted almost 8 bucks for 4 dry ass chicken fingers and a nasty toast. Never again."}
{"text":"Was my first time having a service here and will also be my last.  Ordered an ice cream cake for my bday and they decided to put my middle name instead of my last name. The pick up time is at 5 and we came to pick up at 6 and yet still gotta wait 15 mins for them to finish with the cake.  When I arrive, would have to wait 5 mins till someone finally notice me when they are all in the  other side busy talking.   I didn't wanted to complain at all bc I had to rush home. Cake wasn't all that but the food coloring is horrible. The color would stuck in ur hand for hours even if you try to rinse it out. Gross!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the other reviews are whining about, the food and service here is great.  I got the $6 lunch deal (bacon cheeseburger) and it was pretty damn good for Dairy Queen (and definitely better than McDonalds).  The blizzards are amazing - try the double fudge brownie it's to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is sexist! Only girls are allowed in the front. They hide all the guys in the kitchen."}
{"text":"So glad to have Dairy Queen back in the Southern Highlands area! Need to advertise that it's here. Quick service. The Blizzard was chunky as it should be. Didn't see Orange Julius as part of the store."}
{"text":"I have had multiple bad experiences at this Dairy Queen.  Yesterday was the last straw....   I asked for the $5 lunch and the was told it was after 4pm when it wasn't... when I stated it was before 4pm the employee stated the register won't ring it up after 4pm.  I asked if she tried and she didn't answer.  I waited while she completed the two cars in front of me but she never came back to me until at 3:59 I asked if anyone was there and she asked what she could do for me and I again asked if she tried to ring in the lunch? She said that it was 4pm and by them, it was 4pm so I left.  I go to a Dairy Queen every couple weeks and can't think of a bad experience anywhere except this one! I have made 2 complaints to the Corparate office with no response..  I knocked it up to every company may have a bad  employee but with 3 strikes...."}
{"text":"This DQ is terrible, run away! The owner left and made his only teenager run the store with over 6 customers  waiting for service. Don't go!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Orange Julius I had recently at this DQ.    I have fond and mouth-watering memories of drinking many Orange Julius' as a kid in NYC, and loving every orange cream drop.    I may be suffering from inflated reveries, but the OJ I had recently from this location was a pale imitation of what was a bangin sweet concoction (in my dreams?).  It was lumpy, sickly sweet with a definite artificial flavor overlaying whatever else they put in the mix.    Luckily, I can live without Orange Julius, or maybe, I just have to live without this Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  The service is just terrible.  When you are paying fairly high prices to calm down an ice cream attack, you want decent service.  This isn't the place to get it.   My husband and I have stopped-in a couple of times, as it is fairly close to our house, but we have regretted it every time. So we've decided to drive one more block, during our next ice cream attack, to the Fry's Grocery Store one block away and save ourselves about $6 and have lots of ice cream left over in the freezer!"}
{"text":"They gave me someone else's order and it was pretty melted. Service was super slow. It doesn't take 15 minutes to make a blizzard."}
{"text":"This has got to be the slowest Dairy Queen in the planet get more people get the line moving it's well over 15 minutes to try to get any kind of dessert from this place and then if you do get it what kind of consistency does this place have completely unacceptable waiting time"}
{"text":"This DQ location has an update: they are now paired with Orange Julius and so had to get rid of the fryers. I'm fine with that; I'm just there for the sugary treats anyhow.   I try not to visit this place too often, as it is completely unredeemable nutritionally. But so yummy! Anyway, I was intrigued by the Blizzard flavor of the month (or, as the sign says, the BLIZZ FLAV): Lemon Meringue. So I buckled the kids in the minivan and headed out. It's summer vacation, so I don't feel bad about having them out after 9pm. It seems like most of Sun Prairie felt the same way, because when we got there we were the sixth car or so in line for the drive-through.   Instead of waiting forever in line with the engine running I parked in the miniscule lot and walked in. I was then second in line behind some squirrely teenage girls. There were three young people working, and they were seriously running their arses off. The young woman who helped the teen in front of me and then me was nothing but professional and courteous. My Blizzards were perfection (Lemon Meringue and Mint Oreo).   I docked a star just because the place is so squished."}
{"text":"Does this place have any management or customer service. How long does it take to make 2 vanilla cones and a sundae???????? I counted 6 people working and it took 15 minutes to get our order. Whoever runs this place should find another profession!"}
{"text":"What a blast from the past! I love blizzards and finding this Dairy Queen was definitely a treat!  It's not like a mainstream Dairy Queen. The menu is limited; however, they are fully stocked on the ice cream treats. The food they offer is limited to hot dogs and the best part is they are cheap! A guy ahead of me ordered two hot dogs to go and that actually sounded really good to me. If you are looking for the infamous chicken strip basket with Texas toast and fries...keep looking...you won't find it here.   Living in Texas for so long, I got used to the custom of handing you your blizzard upside down (it was a measure of how thick your blizzard is that it won't spill out). They don't do that here, but I did my own test and it passed.  Like other yelpers have mentioned, there are no seating areas. You walk up, order, and walk around Plaza Midtown or sit in your car. I wish they would add a few benches outside.   Each time I have been past the parking lot is full and people are waiting in line. You have to get there before 10pm...I tend to get my ice cream cravings late. This is a great place to bring your friends or family for an informal ice cream stop. When I was there it was great to see people of all ages with smiles on their faces and ice cream treats in their hands.   An update on a previous post...they take credit cards. Bring your cash, bring your plastic, they will take it all!"}
{"text":"Friendly guys running the place and fast too. It's inside a food court, which I wasn't expecting. Either way, if you want to be able to pop in and get a Oreo Blizzard, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed when I went in there and there was only 1 regular ice cream cake left in the freezer. Also I felt bad for the girl who worked there since she was the only one there during lunch hour. Dairy queen  chain isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"This past Sunday I order on drive thru to order myself an oreo blizzard. The girl named Esther truthfully gave me an amazing experience, not she was very polite when handing out my order but only was very talkative. I recommend her to make my whole family blizzards, even on a busy night these guys knew how to handle it. Good job DQ"}
{"text":"I was craving Dairy Queen for quite awhile.  When I finally went I was wondering what I wanted it so badly for?  I ordered a grape freeze.  The icey slush mixed with soft serve vanilla.  It was was so mediocre.  I felt like I was wasting calories for the day.  If I want a treat I can think of such better/higher quality treats and ice cream."}
{"text":"The lady that helped us was SO nice!  She gave really excellent recommendations and she was very friendly.  I have never had great experiences at Dairy Queen with their employees but this one was stellar!!  Her name is Aeri and she was seriously incredible!  I loved the Reeses blizzard with fudge instead of peanut butter!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about a brownie and peanut butter cookie dought blizzard.  Came in late on a Saturday night and it really wasn't that bad of a spot if you're all in on ice cream."}
{"text":"Located in a food court type of a place, this Dairy Queen is also an Orange Julius, so after a nice pizza from Donato's an original Orange Julius was exactly what I needed.  The gentleman working behind the counter was friendly and efficient and the drink was almost perfect.    The parking lot for this food court (it also has a Donato's and a Bojangles) is pretty small, but early on a Saturday I had absolutely no problem finding a spot - it seems that a lot of people were getting carryout.  Depending on which way you are going when you leave, it may be a bit difficult to get back on Morrison during prime driving hours, but a sweet treat is worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Pretty poor, even in the undemanding world of fast food. Our food was crushed; literally, my wife's sandwich was so smashed it was torn in half. With plenty of other options nearby, there's no reason to go here."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Came here once before with a coupon that allowed for a free royal treat with purchase of another and was able to get the royal blizzard. Tried it this time and all they said a royal blizzard is NOT a royal treat. We even said we had the coupon when ordering so that they wouldn't get confused. Apparently, there is only one royal treat, so I have a coupon for a single menu item. That just doesn't sound right to me.  Also, they messed up the order anyways. We asked for a regular and large royal blizzard and ended up getting a large royal one and a standard regular sized one. Definitely won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think this location is nothing more than incompetent. I go here because it is closest location to me. EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GO HERE, they mess up my fiancé's extremely simple order. She wants a blizzard with m&ms and cookie dough. That's it. But what she gets is either one or the other. Never what she orders. It's freaking ridiculous. EVERY. DAMN. TIME. Is it too complicated for their tiny brains to mix 2 things into a blizzard? This was the last time. I kept giving this place chances and we NEVER end up with what we order. Still love the brand, it's just time to move on to a different location."}
{"text":"Your typical Dairy Queen. Food was average. Not a first choice for quality but for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Came here for a blizzard. The service was quick but staff was not very friendly. Ordered a cookie dough blizzard which comes with fudge but there was not any fudge in mine. Parking is tricky at this location."}
{"text":"They just opened but service was great and food was on point! You would never have guessed that the employees were all new! They don't have all of the items yet and drive thru isn't up and running yet BUT maybe in a couple of weeks they will be good to go! I'm so happy we have a DQ in the neighborhood now! Gives us some variety other than McDonald's and Burger King!!!"}
{"text":"Most definitely will not return here.   Tried to use a coupon from the Community Coupon Book for Buy One Get One Free menu item.   The cashier took off a $3.39 chicken sandwich.   Two minutes later he comes back out to say that his boss hates those coupons, and he would prefer that it had been taken off of the two hot dogs purchased which was going to increase our total by $1.92, and could we please pay the extra $1.92.   HORRIBLE customer service, and way to nickle and dime the customer.   Also, clearly can't do math.....the two hot dogs total $3.59!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    How the hell do I owe more???????   My husband refused to let me dispute this, or I would have just asked for a full refund & walked out.   We will NEVER be back here, and others shouldn't go either.   Happy Holidays."}
{"text":"One has DQ because there's no alternatives within a decent walking distance, and if you're driving, then its a matter of how much time do you have to kill. What I find about DQ's ice cream is that it feels and tastes, man made. It seems like a synthesized dairy product that's probably has less than 50% dairy content."}
{"text":"Love this Dairy Queen! My husband and I frequent this place on hot summer nights... Even if the drive-thru is long they go through it pretty quickly. My only complaint is with my favorite Peanut Buster Parfait they can be a bit skimpy on the nuts and chocolate.."}
{"text":"Came to this location for an after school treat for me and my daughter.  We had one of the discount cards from the Cub Scouts.  I showed the counter person the card and said I could only use it one time.  So I poked and prodded, but why....it does not say that on the card. The response was that \"only the location in Henderson approved the offer and since each DQ was independently owned and operated they would allow one use and mark your card with a punch so you could not use it again\".     I say Boo!!! to that but I understand.  I would not want to give away $1000's of dollars in Blizzards away in one year because one business owner was irresponsible in there discounting and did not seek territory approval.  I get that part.  What I do not get was the RUDE attitude of the young women behind the register.  Why did you feel the need to continually ask me if I wanted you to mark my card.  Seeing that you were going to do that anyway.  Because of your bad attiutde and poor customer service I am positive I will not be back in you establishment for your overpriced ice cream anyways.  What people don't get is that when you live in a city like Las Vegas where you have options.  We have over 20,ooo food and beverage establishments within Clark County.  If you don't like the experience at one business, just drive to the next city block and you will find another that might appreciate you as a guest."}
{"text":"Walked in after dinner wanted a blizzard and a Pepsi freeze. It's busy so I understand we're gonna wait a few minutes, we go inside so we can enjoy our ice cream. The guy in front of us orders for him and his family, were next, step up to order and the employee walks away. Didn't say hi, sorry one moment, I'll be right back, nothing at all just walked away. He make other people's order and went to take it to him, asked us to move out of HIS way. Still never took our order, said hi or even acknowledged us. We left.... We will not be back."}
{"text":"I will admit that my review may be coming through rose colored glasses as my first just ever was at Dairy Queen but hear me out. This DQ has been in Lakewood for longer than I've been alive, so over a quarter century. It is a landmark for some.   It is a typical DQ, no frills in the way of burgers and fries but they do have hotdogs and ice cream which is what I go there for.   The staff is mostly friendly teenagers who are making some spending money which is appreciate since that's what I did in high school too.    I think what I really love about this place is its consultancy. I will always get a good blizzard or shake or cone from a smiling teenager. I've been coming here since before I can remember and it's always been that way.   If you want a burger there's a McDonald's down the road. If you want service with a smile and the type of tasty treat that only Dairy Queen can provide than stop in here."}
{"text":"New York Cheesecake Blizzard with a fudge core.... . There couldn't be a better way to end a Friday, in my mind. Ice cream is my weakness. Had it never been invented, I'd probably never have to worry about my weight. No food makes me quite as happy as ice cream.  Blizzards take some of that love to a new place. I'm a think and creamy milkshake, kind of girl. If it can easily be had through a straw, it's not nearly as good. I can work for my food, I'm okay with that. The only challenge with this blizzard is that I always get a large. The large cup at DQ is tall and skinny. That's fine for beverages and it probably fits in all cup holders for every car manufacturer but for me, even with a long spoon, I'm going to get my hands dirty.  I don't waste food. I especially don't waste soft serve vanilla, swirled with chunks of creamy cheesecake and filled with a cold fudge topping. It's just not my style. So, a tall skinny cup with a long spoon can satisfy most but I'm looking for the last drop.  This particular location is somewhere around a year old. I couldn't be happier to have it within a few miles of my home. I've run passed this area several times when I was training for half marathons or Spartan races. I know to some, that's still not close but it's within 5 miles. New and generally well tended; this location is of course staffed with high school kids. Not a problem but they definitely need to be a little more aware, as most kids do. I asked the cashier what was in the Jurassic Chomp and while he did admit he didn't know, he still didn't know. That blizzard was released several weeks ago, I can't be the first one to ask.  The staff is overall, friendly and attentive. They do move quickly and will fix any mistakes. I haven't experienced issues with my ice cream obsession but I've seen a few come back to the counter with something missing on a food item or another problem. The crew is very willing to correct that and move on. Hopefully, this place continues to stay clean and full of decent staff."}
{"text":"You had 1 job.  Write \"Happy Birthday Ulices\" on a cake. I wrote it out for you. You spelled his name wrong and tried to fix it badly. Then you didn't offer to show it to me to see if it was right. Disappeared into the back of the store. I could excuse the slightly sloppy and not centered lettering, but not compounded with a misspelled name. Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Tonight we drove out of our way to go enjoy a last minute dessert. We checked before we went to make sure they were open. When we got there they were closed up completely, we arrived at 9:28pm and they aren't suppose to close until 10pm. Needless to say we were perturbed!!!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers & salads!!! $5.00 lunch boxes r the deal nice workers here at this location"}
{"text":"Terrible interstate food stop. We ordered a 4 piece and six piece chicken strip meals.  The strips were have the size I receive at other Dairy Queen's.  The onion rings order was half an order clumped together. They were cooked golden brown except where the clump was. The clump was uncooked."}
{"text":"Cashier friendly a lot of chatter between employees instead of taking care of customers the smoothies are great never had a bad one yet"}
{"text":"They don't honor the dairy queen promise. I sent my 11 year old daughter to get two blizzards. My daughter came back to the car and her blizzard was melted. I asked did they do the upside down test she said he only did it on yours. I go back in and turn it upside down on the counter and it runs everywhere. I said how could you possibly give this to my child? The young lady apologized and made a new one. When I asked about honoring the dairy queen promise a guy comes from the back screaming I did the upside down check on your order. I said really because I just spilled it all over your counter. He's arguing back and forth and didn't honor my free blizzard. I will never go back to that dairy queen probably no other one either. Horrible! The worst customer service."}
{"text":"Do you ever have those cravings after an event and you just want a sugar fix. On our way home. We noticed this Dairy Queen establishment which was like back in time. Found out this Dairy Queen was built in 1947. Amazing with the backdrop of the city in the background makes it a spectacular view.  Had my first Dilly Bar. Thick layer of chocolate and the treat is the ice cream inside. Reminds me of a Dove Bar but it without all that sugar and at a fraction of the price.  What a treat..."}
{"text":"I feel like I should have asked for a refund. I went through the drive-through and ask for a kids meal for my nephew and also ask for barbecue sauce. When I waited at the window they took my card and had me wait there for almost 20 minutes. As I watch the employees and saw them get the orders of the other customers yet I was still waiting at the window for my order. When I finally got my order I checked in my bag and I didn't have any barbecue sauce as well as the banana was really old. I asked if they had another banana but they let me know that this was the only kind of bananas that they had even in the refrigerator in the back. I then asked the water and the cashier let me know that it did not come with the water but in the description on the menu it showed that it did have a water she double-checked and then she corrected herself and said it did have a water. So overall I'm not happy with the service and I'm not happy with the wait time. I think management really needs to come into play when teaching their employees how to serve customers because I don't think I'll ever go to that specific location again to order food because of this experience."}
{"text":"Please double check your order before you leave. They get it wrong often. I ordered ice cream, got it home and discovered a nice long HAIR inside. I didn't see HAIRY ICE CREAM on the menu. Dirty, dirty, dirty."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome DQ. The management that runs this location is superb!  The first time I went here was to purchase ice cream & some smoothies (from the Orange Julius within the store) with coupons from my Entertainment book. Since I was using two coupons, I thought me and my boyfriend would have to purchase separately. The lady was nice enough to not make it difficult b/c the exception on the coupon did say \"only one per visit or customer\". (I forget since I don't have it anymore.)  My most recent experience was this past week. My sister wanted to order a photo ice cream cake from them for my niece's birthday. She wasn't able to go during the week, so we asked if we could e-mail them the photo with all the necessary information and they were totally fine with it. They were awesome, kept in touch, and the cake turned out great!  My family has ordered three ice cream cakes from this location within the past 6 months and they have tasted like heaven every single time. (We always order the Oreo Cookie & Cream ice cream cake.) They are consistent and I love that I can depend on that.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone ordering an ice cream cake. There is no better place for cakes. TRUST ME! I literally dream about their cakes a night and have withdrawals between my nieces/nephews birthday parties.   Note: I have uploaded the pictures of the cakes we've purchased in the photo section."}
{"text":"Please avoid this location if you are hungry , order our food , worker at the register was unfriendly , we sat down and waited 20 minutes waiting for food , I went to check on them asked the worker for our order he looked behind and our food was just sitting there getting cold , he apologized , we had chicken strips and they gave us tartar sauce for chicken strips , I went and asked one of the other workers and said that's what they put on there , they don't bother asking what sauce we liked unlike the other DQ we been to , didn't give us fries sauce either , overall it was a bad location to get food , ohhh there was nobody in the restaurant sitting if your wondering that it may have to do with business being busy , it wasn't they were just not on top of their game."}
{"text":"Ok fist thing as soon as u walk in the door no greeting no smiles or any customer service skills at all  Then u get to the ice cream I got the royal ores blizzard and there was next to no fudge in it at all like the picture over all bad experience. I will not be dining at this DQ again"}
{"text":"When this opened, I was skeptical. I mean, do we really need an ice cream place next to Concordia? Ice cream is taken in the summer and the biggest influx of students is in the fall and winter.   I walked by today (September 12th 2017) and was surprised to see they also offered food! (burgers, hot dog) I was planning on eating somewhere else but I was curious and got the chili cheese dog. It was ok, fast food hot dog. But decent for a place that serves mostly ice cream.  I got the combo and that comes with Lay's original chips and a choice of soda. The whole thing cost me 5.16$ with taxes and student discount (10%).   You can't beat the price. Service is fast and friendly. The location is tiny but clean. I do not recommend eating there, get to go and eat at Concordia or just to go and hop in the metro/your bus and go home.  I was pleasantly surprised by this location and will probably visit again."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER ..I come here everyday for a chocolate dipped ice cone in a cup and every time I come here they forget something rather it's a cone the cup etc after the order was repeated to me, numerous times I have came up to the drive through the employees were laughing and giggling my last straw is today I went Thru the drive and received a blizzard with hair on top I gave it back and asked for managers number and some older white lady refused and got into a full blown argument with me in the drive Thru"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely terrible, the employees were incredibly rude! All the staff (kids) did was mess around the whole time we were there. I didn't see one of them cleaning what so ever. All we could here from back behind the counter was such loud singing, A TON of cussing and the staff yelling at each other. But the thing that stood out the most was how insanely rude the staff (kids) were to their managers!!! I couldn't believe it. Yesenia, I think her hat said, was so mind blowing. She is the reason I will never go back there. She is the reason I will highly recommend everyone I know to go to a different location."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! This has got to be the Stupidest people in the history of drive thru food working at this location!!! I swear I have been to this location three times and I keep hoping for the best but it's like they get stupider every time! I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt because it's DQ but these people here are absolutely incompetent. Please save yourself don't go here"}
{"text":"I stopped by quite a few times with my friends right after school and they treated us pretty well. There was only this one time where we were yelled at because we were deciding what to order \"too loudly\" ."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst DQs I've visited.  They have no grill and the food is subpar.  The service was also not very responsive."}
{"text":"Stopped for just ice cream, no food. Location was easy to find and clean. Our order was correct. Napkins were only available on tables in the dining area, not by where you pick up the ice cream."}
{"text":"It was 3:50pm and I hadn't eaten anything since 8am so I needed something to suppress my appetite until dinner without spoiling it. A smoothie from Orange Julius fit the bill.  I got the premium fruit smoothie blend, strawberry and banana flavor. According to the sign, it's made with real fruit and low fat yogurt. I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I don't know if it was because I was starvin marvin at the time and would have been satisfied with anything, but that smoothie really hit the spot.  I recommend the premium fruit smoothies, as I don't know if the other blends use real fruit. There are 8 different flavors. Try the strawberry banana if you don't know what else to get. I plan on going back again  to try the others."}
{"text":"This is the most lit Dairy Queen on the face of the earth or any subsequent planet. The management really did a fantastic job. It tastes better than any other Dairy Queen I have ever been to. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars if I could. Rude service, over priced and the food was awful. My chicken wrap thing had so much grease I couldn't eat it, the picture doesn't do justice. Don't come here."}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I'm in Boulder City. I sing in Boulder City's Red Mountain choir, and every time after a concert, I stop by here to congratulate myself on a wonderful several months of rehearsing."}
{"text":"Dear DQ, you get a D for your fast food quality, and a Q for your customer service and restaurant maintenance. It's a shame because your ice cream is great. I preordered a father's day cake, filled out a form with details, only to pick up... no cake! Good thing I brought the receipt, they gave me a cake, but the icing decor is so horrid I felt like crying. (Check out photo).   Secondly, your restaurant cleanliness standards are no short of disgusting. When I arrived, one whole section floor was wet and full of tissues on the floor, the soda machine was leaking soda all over the other side, and the tables all had leftover wrappers, napkins and both the floors and the tables were Sticky. The entire time we were there NO ONE was cleaning. I am surprised anyone goes back here to eat.  Thirdly, your staff is very slow and unprofessional.  Kid in front of me was asking for a cup of water and the counter guy rolled his eyes at her before giving the cup. Moreover, he kept yawning while taking orders!!! So disrespectful, and obviously, 100% disinterested in providing any decent service.  I noticed on yelp several of your outlets get poor reviews. I really hope you would listen to your customers before they all decide to leave you.  P.S. For ice cream cakes guys (and ice cream, Italian ice), Rita's on rainbow sells good ones, plus their customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I was very excited to learn that Surprise had a Dairy Queen on Reems.  I went to the drive-in to place an order for a large cone, as well as, a box of Dilly Bars.  There was a red car and a pickup truck in front of me.  The car just sat there for well over 10 minutes without moving.  It was sitting there when I drove in and I have no idea how long it had been sitting there before I arrived.  In the meantime there were cars coming in behind me.  Finally the red car moved forward and then the pickup was next.  He too seemed to wait for several minutes....but not as long as the red car....before he moved forward.  Then it was my turn!  I waited and waited and finally said \"Hello\" over the loud speaker.  The response was just a minute.  Then when I had waited for 12 more minutes I said \"Hello\" again.  A female voice said \"Hello\" and I said \"Can you take my order?\"  Not right now...there are only two of us here and we are horribly busy!!!! This is ridiculous!  Obviously there isn't enough staff to cover around 3:30 pm when all of the kids get out of school.  I drove off without ordering anything.  I went to the Diary Queen in Sun City West and the drive-in answered me immediately and also took my order and even though there were cars ahead of me I still got my order many minutes before it was my turn to order and there was no one to help me at the DQ on Reems!  They have no idea what CUSTOMER SERVICE is at all!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite DQ'. super clean, friendly and  courteous employees who always have a smile . Great job on blizzards and they put the perfect amount of topping on the sundaes., there is nothing worse than running out of topping and still having ice cream in the bottom of your bowl."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen, but this location is SLOW and D I R T Y. We've been through the drive thru on multiple occasions and have been left waiting for 30 minutes at times. The workers seem uncaring and the location is a little gross. I come here because I live two minutes away and sometimes we get a Dilly Bar craving that can only be satisfied by Dairy Queen. Sigh, a lot to improve on with this location."}
{"text":"Great ice cream rude African American lady in drive through would have rated way higher if customer service was better. It's not our fault she is working in fast food at her mature age.  Seems very bitter"}
{"text":"Does this place have management? came in with kids to get ice cream... No towels to dry hands in the bathrooms.  Then we were given ice cream that was already melting off the cone.  Went to grab napkins to wipe already dripping ice cream and they have no napkins in the whole establishment!! Never again will I come to this place... very poorly ran and not clean!!"}
{"text":"Amazing friendly service. Food was fresh and delicious. It was super clean. I was really impressed. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"They seem to have just got a new staff. Tonight there were two guys working who were either poorly trained or very high. Walked in and there was no line and they got our order wrong twice. If you go here do not order more than two toppings in a blizzard or it will probably be wrong. It cannot be that hard to work in a place that only serves desserts. The owner needs to get in here quick and get it straightened out because the kids he has working here are not getting the job done at all."}
{"text":"Just got the new honey barbecue chicken strips....great taste, especially topped off with a blizzard...."}
{"text":"Don't order their hot dog meal combo. I was told they had no mustard or ketchup during lunchtime. Okay.. perhaps that was understandable as they did not expect a customer like me to order food, in a store with no seating. However, then she told me they did not have strawberry sundaes... Ugh.  The lady was very friendly the whole time though."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Dairy Queen in the world. They take FOREVER to make food, they are closed during mid day when I seem to go around noon, and they always messing up my order. I get the Oreo blizzard and it seems that there is never Oreos below the bottom half of the cup. It's unfortunate that this is the closest location to me. I am a big DQ fan and it's upsetting that this is the quality of service I receive."}
{"text":"I have visited this location a few times and the service is always great, I'm not sure why people complain about the time it takes in the drive thru. Don't be lazy, go walk inside if you're in a hurry lol, otherwise you are at the mercy of the car(s) in front of you."}
{"text":"Their slush machine was broken almost all summer. I went elsewhere to get my freezes."}
{"text":"Hopefully the new Fresh Market next door will revitalize this strip mall. The always very yong crew does there best preparing frozen treats, you just have to hope you don't get in line behind someone ordering hot dogs. Who goes to dq for hot dogs? Great ice cream, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is one of the oldest ones in Charlotte. No outdoor seating, limited parking, and the lines can be super long in the summer. With all that said, the ice cream is delicious, and they are fairly fast with orders. The staff isn't always super friendly but my interaction with them is so brief that I don't really mind. It is a staple in Plaza Midwood for sure."}
{"text":"I came here for Blizzards for the fam.  When I got home, my hubby asked me what that intoxicating fragrance was, when I was near him.  To which I replied it was Dirty Fryer Oil de Toillette.  Seriously, would it kill them to change out the oil?! Other places that fry stuff do not smell like this.  I had to hang my head out of the window like a dog on the way home to try to get that smell out of my hair.  It just permeates in your clothes and hair the minute you walk in.  If I didn't love my blizzards so much I wouldn't come here at all."}
{"text":"Nearly every item I ordered they where either out of parts to make it, or didn't know how to yet. (\"Our manager hasn't taught us how to make it yet.\")"}
{"text":"DQ runs are always fun and the  staff at this DQ is  always friendly and welcoming.... the icecream? Well..it's great!!!! Who doesn't love a yummy blizzard or chocolate dipped cone???!!! Mmm?"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Took 30 minutes for our order than when I get home the order is wrong.  I wanted the new guardians of the galaxy blizzard and I got cotton candy.  On top of that when we got to the window the guy just sat there with the window closed for 5 minutes. I contacted customer service about this and they did nothing.  I refuse to support this company any longer and I will get my family and friends to follow.  Hopefully bankrupt this entire franchise.  You catch more bees with honey than you do with salt."}
{"text":"I use to live next to a Dairy Queen in Ohio and I and almost everyone came over would buy blizzards. When I moved here the cost at this location for a small blizzard was more than a large I Ohio. I realize we are in the desert , but the price for a large is so much here that I my as well buy a half gallon of ice cream elsewhere. Service and cleanliness was good as was the blizzard but overpriced. As another yelper said I came back again for a promo from a commercial I seen and they where not participating  I understand rent may be higher in this area but seems like price gouging and will no longer go to this location. Just gonna make my own ice cream creations at home or occasionally go to cold stone when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"I had two coupons. The older rude lady that took the order was very rude. I'm sure they spent a lot of money printing these coupons to bring people in to have some smart Alec lady at the counter be rude about the fact you're not supposed to use two it one time. I said no problem I will walk outside and then you can ring it up the second time when I come back in. I mean I'm spending $30 in the store to save 6.99 give me a break."}
{"text":"After repeating my order 4 times they were able to make out what I was saying. Lucky for me everything I had ordered was in my bag. I opened my side orders of gravy and found the bottom of one of my lids filthy with who knows what. I didn't feel confident that the food I was eating wouldn't cause me a stomach ache so I just threw it out. They also advertise Pepsi but when I ordered one I was advised by staff they only have coke products? That's confusing. Regardless- I can guarantee I will never go to this location ever again"}
{"text":"While eating in the restaurant, I saw one of their employees yell at two customers (who looked to me like professional women) and refused to sell them the cake they had picked out.  I called to report this to a manager, and it turns out it was the owner who had thrown them out.  She said they had made a rude comment about her to an employee, but I didn't see that, just her coming out from the back with the cake, refusing to write on it or sell it to them.  She told them she didn't need their business.  Very strange!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the ice cream but I'm a huge fan for there new pretzel sticks. There better then I thought and will definitely go back. Pretzels are my weakness."}
{"text":"Very friendly customer service. The restaurant is clean, the chairs pushed in. There was a hiccup in their system which happens which was kind of annoying but it couldn't be helped on their part. The customers are shady in this establishment, but think of the area you're in."}
{"text":"Rude gentleman this exact visit. I ordered for my friends and then stopped to select something for myself just because he was such an ass. Literally shouldn't their employees be friendly..how can an employee yell at customers ?"}
{"text":"It's not a fancy place and the clientele is pretty questionable.  You'll often find someone sleeping in the alley behind the adjacent building - so don't slam a blizzard, get a sugar buzz, hop into your car and go careening out the back of the parking lot, only to run over a dozing bum! It can be a little bit difficult to pull out of their parking lot, but aside from that, the place is always clean and the workers have always been friendly and efficient.  Hey, it's DQ.  What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"It's Dairy Queen.  And this restaurant is what you would expect.  Ice cream and fried foods goodness.  I joined the Blizzard Fan Club, so I go every other month when I have a BOGO medium blizzard.    DQ updates their menu frequently, so it is always fun to see what the new flavor of blizzard will be.  My favorite is still chocolate chip cookie dough and brownie bites, though the Jurassic World promotional flavor with added peanut butter cookie dough to the mix was pretty good.  The service is pretty standard.  Nothing great, nothing bad.  I still don't get why they turn your blizzard upside down before serving it to you everytime, so I just giggle at them.  Does it ever fall out?  According to a sign, if they don't do this, they will give you a free blizzard.  They also serve normal ice cream, ice cream cakes, and sandwiches and fries...but really...who goes to Dairy Queen for that. :)"}
{"text":"This location has been here forever. I've had many blizzards and treats over my 26 years of living in the area. Came tonight for a couple blizzards and they were great. The inside is clean and up to date."}
{"text":"Went there with my kids on a hot day. As we pull up to the menu, you can barley understand the person speaking with you and when the repeat the order I had to say what 3 times. We got to the window and she asks for my card, then she starts our order. She hands me two ice cream cones with napkins and I hand them to my kids. She tries to hand me one more and I said I only ordered 2. She argued with me and said she repeated the order. I refused to argue with her and I just waited in my car while everyone went on with what they were doing. She didn't say anything to me and just stared at the computer. I am a server and I understand miscommunication, but to do nothing about it or say sorry or something is rude and I will never go there again. It's horrible to think that people just want to be rude."}
{"text":"Horrible service, staff is rude, owner is even worse. Won't admit to mistakes and made us pay to get our mistake fixed. Our brownie was rock hard and not edible. We got a slushy and the powder wasn't even mixed in. This location has a lot of potiental if it wasn't so dirty and unfriendly."}
{"text":"I picked up a birthday cake yesterday and was very disappointed to cut into it and find that the middle crumbly layer didn't have enough chocolate sauce to hold it together.  The two ice cream layers separated and made quite a mess.  I contacted them and will update my review depending on how they handle this.  Update: Not handled, and will not buy a cake here again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this DQ since 2009 and their food portions were pretty big or at least decent. Today (July 8th) I ordered a Chicken tender basket, 4pc and I'm disappointed. There was probably 10 small fries and very tiny chicken tenders in the basket. If you want chicken tenders and fries or burgers DO NOT GO HERE, go to some other place for food. I know now that I should just go here for the blizzards and other ice cream and I recommend the same to you."}
{"text":"I am always looking at yelp before I go places, I didn't for this trip because I figured no Dairy Queen can be bad... wrong. I usually don't review but I'm so annoyed I have to. The employees were so incredibly rude and inattentive . But most of all SLOW! Holy crap, waited about 20 mins for 2 blizzards, cheese curds, and pretzel sticks. Seriously? And what's more annoying is they brought the blizzards first, so we were finished by the time we got our food.  A few customers came in while we were there and 3 people walked out because the line wasn't moving and the 2 employees weren't even in sight. At one point the woman called out a blizzard for another customer so softly that after about 5 mins she picked it up to go throw it away and a guy in line said, I think that's the girls at the table... seriously? say it louder or go bring it to the table..   Lastly, I asked for a smores blizzard (which I know isn't in season yet but all other locations still make it for me because it's just chocolate chips, graham cracker, and marshmallow). Well she told me they didn't have it, which is a flat out lie because my blizzard had marshmallow in it and my boyfriends had graham cracker in it.  Just straight up lazy and rude."}
{"text":"Omg for fast food it's pretty damn good!!! Went through the drive thru. First time ever at a Dairy Queen that had hot food!!! loved everything except the burger. Had the burger  been flavorful this place would have 4 stars. The little brunette girl in drive thru was so nice and cheery!   Ok it is fast food, it's cheap, it's easy and it's a block away!!! Lol enough said!  Ok let's get into the food.   Ordered the number 4 a double cheese burger meal, a small plain cone and the cheese curds. The small plain come was huge! I took a picture in the drive thru. And I ate the whole thing in the drive thru because it took sooo long. No seriously I think I was at the window for 5-7 minutes!  Got home the cheese curds soooo good! Kinda like mini cheese sticks. I loved the fries cooked perfectly. Now the burger it had all the right stuff on it. Cooked to hockey puck standards just like all the chains but no good burger flavor. It was so boring and flavorless my dog had a gourmet meal!   My advise stick with the ice cream and the sides avoid the burgers!"}
{"text":"I give two stars because the ice cream is yummy, but every time I've gone to this location, it seems like a disorganized circus inside. They get my order wrong 9/10 times I go through. The mix-ins are never mixed all the way to the bottom of the blizzard. Our cones were half dipped. Maybe this location is used for training new hires or something. If so, the service would make more sense. That being said, the ice cream is good, so we keep going back - even though at this point we expect the service itself to be sub-par."}
{"text":"I've come to accept the fact that 90% of the time, our order will be wrong. This is after going several times. It's conveniently located, hence our visits, but it's gotten pretty bad at this point"}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a large Oreo blizzard- I think it's safe to say there was one Oreo in the entire thing. And it was melted as soon as we opened it. Unfortunatley we used the drive-thru and I couldn't get my money back. Worst blizzard. EVER. We will not be coming back to DQ..."}
{"text":"Clearly the best DQ in the area. Newly updated fresh and clean. The staff is young and polite, nice to see they are trained correctly for high school students. Even when it's crazy packed on a Friday night and people are rude at the counter, I noticed Maya (Mya?) held it together behind the counter as a customer complained about his chicken strips being double stripped. What ever that means. I ordered 4 blizzards and mine came out fine."}
{"text":"Listen. I understand that I'm reviewing a Dairy Queen so I shouldn't be expecting much in terms of service. But honestly, I really don't want to go back to this location because of the terrible way the employees deal with customers.   I came here on a Friday night in February with my boyfriend. We were getting some ice cream for ourselves and to take to some people back home. The place was busy, yes, but there is no need to have 4 teenage kids working one shift while in reality only two are taking orders and making ice cream.. Anyhow.   We first walked in and went to their frozen case to pick up a box of Dilly Bars. I picked one out of the box and walked to the counter so we could complete our order. While holding the box, I realized that there was some sticky sauce on the outside. I didn't even say anything to the employee, I just sat the box on the counter and wiped my hands with a napkin. Before I could place the order, he snatched the box away from me and told me to go get another one. He didn't offer that I could get another, he demanded. Awkwardly, I got another box and ordered an ice cream cone with sprinkles. Before we could tell him what else we wanted, he walked away and came back with the cone. We intended to order three more blizzards, but had to order them one at a time because we couldn't manage to get the order out without the guy rolling his eyes and slumping over to the ice cream machine to make a blizzard. Are you serious? Do you really not need any business? He seemed so annoyed that we kept adding items on to our order, but if he just stayed and listened to the whole thing he wouldn't have created more work for himself! Essentially he just made himself mad and took it out on us.. He even made sighs when we were asking for what we wanted. What a joke. I paid for our ice cream and left. Seriously terrible customer service. Of course the ice cream is good, but it's Dairy Queen so it's pretty universal whether you get it here or across the country.   Just a note to the owners, there are a ton of people out there looking for jobs who won't jeopardize your business with poor attitudes. It's not that difficult to serve ice cream and chicken fingers. Come on."}
{"text":"Buyers beware! I have been to this DQ several times with minimal complaint. It is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me. Today I brought my daughter and we purchased ice cream and food and the cashier told me the bill total was $8.00 even. I gave him my credit card and he ran it. At first I didn't think he was going to give me a receipt. I guess they just have a slow credit card machine.  He finally handed me the credit card receipt, not the actual receipt the cash register produces and I noticed that the card had been swiped for $10.00. At first I thought maybe there was a fee for using a credit/debit card and next I thought, wow, that's ridiculous. When he delivered the food, I asked him why the bill was $8 and the receipt showed my card had been charged $10 and he said, \"oh\" and walked back the register and instantly popped the drawer open, took out $2 and ripped the receipt off and walked over to me. He showed me the total and said, \"you were right\" and handed me the $2. Umm....ok. So basically, my advice is to watch your receipts very closely, ask for both copies, the credit card and the register one, and maybe even pay with cash cuz last time I checked the 8 and the 10 weren't \"next to each other\" on a keyboard and I am not sure there's a plausible excuse for this accidentally happening. I am thinking that that employee thinks he's running some kind of scam where he skims a couple bucks off every credit card transaction and pockets the extra money at the end of the day and that's some bullsh*t. I will be contacting the store directly tomorrow to voice my concerns with their manager although maybe he or she's in on it too. Might be best to avoid this location unless you're actually wanting give your money away to dishonest people."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for Buy one get blizzard get the second free. When we got there I was told the coupon must be printed. No where on the coupon does it say the coupon has to be print, so of course the manager would not horror the coupon. Because their system only works with the paper coupons, it's 2017 time to update your system."}
{"text":"We were tight on time and had to choose fast food during some business meetings. The group was angling toward Wendy's, but imho, if you're choosing food that quite frankly, not healthy, just go for the gold of fat and cholesterol. DQ did not disappoint. Their 1/2 pound burger is of course well done in temperature, but it holds its own with plenty of fat in reserve to deliver an umami flavor. Okay, I used umami so that I didn't say moist, juicy, or flavorful. And I agree that their ice cream cakes are the bomb!  The location is accessible right off I-480 and SR 91 in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Horrible. They always hand me my blizzard melted and and they are very rude and always always always mess are order up. Me and my gf finally gave up on going. If your in the mood for ice cream. Try thriftys ice cream in right next to fry in that water store and the price is right. 2 scoops like 3.50. You can actually walk there from DQ"}
{"text":"The facility appearances inside and out are up to par, very neat and orderly. However, I have not experienced such an unprofessional cashier at the Dairy Queen, ever. Gina, the cashier that took my order did not greet me as she had the customer prior to me. Next, she seemed uneasy to take my order. And while taking my order, she interrupted me to help a customer she had already serviced.  It's safe to say she is in the wrong profession. So I decided contact corporate, if people want a job in customer service, have a level of professionalism or quit."}
{"text":"We come where all the time, the workers are friendly and courteous. Our orders are always correct and we dont wait long. Once in awhile there's a rush of customers with two employees but it's smooth  In reading the reviews I found it surprising that the place wasn't clean. I haven't experienced that yet"}
{"text":"It's Dairy Queen, how can they really get it wrong?  I can't say they are the best ice cream ever, but I know what I am getting when I go and I'm never disappointed. My son is always adventurous will always try the blizzard of the month; he's never complained."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen does not have chocolate ice cream.  I only gave them 2 stars because at least the staff are efficient getting people through lines.  Keep in mind they haven't had chocolate ice cream in about a year.  They also managed to get my order wrong. I ordered one item..."}
{"text":"Place does not have a full lunch menu. Employees are not well trained and do not know menu items. It took 5 minutes just to order a box of Dilly Bars."}
{"text":"Expensive, not tasty grilled items, ice cream is ok, iced milk actually  Store not always all that clean and often a Little sticky  Young eager staff doing their best though  Stick to the ice products and dodge the grilled"}
{"text":"With 3 people working it shouldn't take this long children..... Get it together pls We had to go back and ask for them to remake ours, it didn't stand up to the test. Once remade it was pretty good but the wait and re-do make me not want to try again."}
{"text":"Disappointment after disappointment at this particular location.  Sadly, with my hometown DQ suddenly closing earlier this summer, I really needed this DQ to step up to the plate and fill a void.  It's just been mishap after mishap.  No buster bars one day. No vanilla ice cream another. Worse yet, vanilla ice cream that was completely melted on another.  Yet, why do we return?  A pipedream that perhaps they'll clean up their act?"}
{"text":"I live right down the road. I often walk my children to dairy Queen. The older woman in the morning is RUDE. She doesn't great her guests, she is an ORDER TAKER ONLY. She has absolutely not one customer service bone in her body. She doesn't even say bye. Now, I am a manager at a fine dining restaurant this is what I expected from this woman.  Welcome in, our flavor of the day is vanilla topped or dipped. How are you doing today? What can I get you today?  Okay, great that will be $... Do you mind waiting for a moment while I make your order?   Here is your vanilla cone topped with Oreo! Thanks for coming to DQ!  Absolutely nothing. Not even a smile.  Now, at night, layed back, happy. They are more attentive with their customers then in the  morning!BUT IVE NOTICED THIS LOCATION BEING CLOSED RANDOMLY WHEN THEIR SIGN INDICATES THEY SHOULD BE OPEN. LAST NIGHT INFACT I SAW THE GROUP OF KIDS WHO WORK THERE WALKING TO HAVEN BURGER. I GET IT YOU DESERVE A BREAK, BUT IDEALLY ONE GOES ON A BREAK AND THE OTHER ONE RUNS THE SHOW AND YOU ROTATE. NOT CLOSE DOWN. THEN THEY WENT BACK THEY ALL RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO DELIVER ICE CREAM TO HAVEN BURGER, FOOD EXCHANGE. COME ON. THEY HAD 5 PEOPLE WAITING PATIENTLY OUTSIDE OF DQ . Lost my business that night. I went across the street to the little Mexican spot and had a delicious hand scooped waffle cones that my children absolutely loved. I really think these owners need to reevaluate who they have working and managing for them."}
{"text":"So glad we have this here now. Soft serve ice cream and Blizzards! The whole family loves it."}
{"text":"I'm really enjoying Dairy Queen lately. The food is good and the ice cream is good. I like the chicken fingers. I'd recommend getting gravy for the fries, it's nice gravy. For ice cream the peanut butter cup blizzard is the best. Make sure to ask for extra peanut butter sauce to make it extra good."}
{"text":"Can't beat their softserve. We went here for an icecream and my friend ended up getting chicken fingers and fries too. Quick, friendly, fast service from the teenagers -- it's all fried food and easy icecream so it can't be messed up. They also have a freezer of ready to purchase icecream cakes if you need one."}
{"text":"During my pregnancy, I came here more often than I'd like to admit to fulfill my craving for a chocolate dipped cone. Sometimes service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get that one employee who actually cares about their job and will hustle to get your order ready. But then again, it's your typical DQ with young employees just there for a paycheck who could give 2 craps about you. There were times I was in and out within 2 minutes and other times I was there for 10+ minutes. I've seen the shop super clean and I've seen it when there has been napkins all over the floor. I guess it just depends on the day you visit. But whatever though, they have my yummy chocolate dipped cone and it's close to my house. So I'll be back when that cravings hits again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at this location for their frozen treats.  I normally put fast food at 2-3 stars, but this place gets the fourth star for two reasons.  First, I'm really impressed with the cheerful attitude by the staff, even though they are often slammed in the evenings.  Second, this place is always neat and clean.  Awesome Blizzards."}
{"text":"Went to this DQ last night and Wendy was very helpful! She was very accommodating and had great customer service, the other associates had great customer service too! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Once again fail order not correct and even asked them if they remembered to add the brownies to my blizzard was told yes. Got home and there were not one in it.  They were very slow at taking orders and even slower getting them out.. Tried calling but no one would answer (called at 9:00) so yes they were open.  The cheese burger was very dry tasted premade and was sitting in a warmer."}
{"text":"Ordered butterfinger blizzard disappointed !!!!!mostly all vanilla tiny few dots of Butterfinger. Friday at 8pm :("}
{"text":"I came here at 9 pm last night and the women working said \"I can't make any drinks, we close soon\" you close soon? Girl, you close in an hour..you're just lazy. I asked for a water and she walked EXTREMELY slow to get it..management needs to do something about this problem. The women refused service to other people in line too because the shop was closing in an HOUR."}
{"text":"We went through the drive-thru to order figured that it wouldn't take as long since there were only two cars in ahead of us. Gave our order and silence... The girl came back on and asked to repeat the order from the beginning and rushed through like I was wasting her time and she already knew. Okaaaay, why did I need to repeat from the beginning?? Rude. Got to the window and it was another ten minute wait for two blizzards. No greeting, took my card and handed it back, no eye contact, stayed in monotone on her headset. There were three other employees in the store. She was wiping the excess off of each cup with a dirty rag, awesome. As she was putting the lid on the 2nd blizzard, she and her co-worker pulled what looked like a hair from the cup. When she brought it to the window I asked her what she pulled from the cup and she said \"it was a chocolate something...I don't know...\" That was the only time her tone had any fluctuation. Will not be going back to this location again because the customer service was definitely lacking and the cashier could have cared less."}
{"text":"This dairy queen location is the best I've ever been to. The food actually tastes like it has been grilled and the staff is friendly. It's fast and convenient. Only minor problem is it closes so early compared to some other places and sometimes the location is closed 5-10 minutes prior to official closing time."}
{"text":"Stopped in to order my crew blizzards, 12 of them! On the way to the car the bag ripped open and they all hit the floor. Before I even walked back in they are already remaking my entire order! They were super friendly and super nice about it I come here a lot and always get a fantastic service!"}
{"text":"A dear friend is a fan of DQ.  The only time we go here is after our play dates on a hot day.  My little cutie pie always get the small vanilla soft serve, while I get a mini blizzard.  We both have some sensitivities to chemical preservatives, but we do not seem to have any reactions after eating their ice cream.  Out of curiosity, I decided to look at the ingredients online since we might hit this place more often.  I am saddened to report that our ice cream in this country really isn't what it used to be anymore.    Here are the lab created ingredients:  Milkfat and non fat milk, sugar, corn syrup, mono and dyglicerides, artificial flavor, guar gum, carageenan, polysorbate 80 and vitamin A Palmitate.  So disappointed that this is what most places serve and pass as ice cream.  Where are the real ingredients which consists of milk, cream, sugar, egg and vanilla?    I will have to do a search for a local place who use real food to satisfy our cravings!"}
{"text":"tldr  Wasn't feeling well still recovering from EDC and wanted something sweet. Never been before, but definitely a paradise for desert with ice cream cakes and shakes. The place was clean and staff was very friendly.  Got: -mini royal Oreo blizzard treat: way too creamy for my taste and the added fudge in the middle made this too sweet; perhaps I should gotten the regular blizzard."}
{"text":"I had a very bad customer service experience yesterday at 6030 Highway 7 Location! Bought 10inch ice cream cake for $39.99 while clearly on the box wrote $33.99 (i even still have the picture with the price written on the box cover). I worked at a customer service industry before, so i knew what a customer service is. None of the employees are apologizing for their mistake. Just kept pointing that other boxes written $39.99 (which i dont care what other box are written, i want the box that i chose which said $33.99). The worst part is when 4 employees are like \"gang up\" and trying to defend themselves like a school kids. I just asked the manager, which can't give a proper explanation either, her name is Subash. I don't even want to waste my energy to argue. That particular store clearly needs a Customer service training!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've experienced. The employees were cussing and on their phones when I walked in. The employees weren't cleaned up with their appearance. I asked for the chicken fingers and the guy at the counter proceeded to tell me that people have been complaining about the food cause it's been cold...um what? Not something you should be telling a customer. I walked out, didn't buy anything, and will never come back to this location. Completely grossed out."}
{"text":"Came to this DQ For the $5 cheeseburger lunch special. I ordered in the drive thru but I had to pull over to the side to wait for my food to be ready. Just to find my food was really cold and they only gave me a handful of fries for my meal. Won't be returning to this DQ."}
{"text":"This location sucks when you ask for a blizzard Reese's or Oreo they are Skimpy they hardly put any in there might as well be a vanilla blizzard"}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this DQ they have gotten my order wrong. The last time the girl behind the counter was training someone so the trainer took our order then when it came out it was noticeably wrong but she never said anything. Don't you think if you were training a new employee you would want to show quality control? I know it's just ice cream but I'm tired of it always being wrong every time."}
{"text":"Ever since the ownership changed, this place had spiralled downhill. The store was dirty, crumbs everywhere and the garbage bins were always full. As a former employee that worker here before the ownership changed and lost my job because I was in the hospital for a while. Not only was I unable to come back, I was judged and discriminated because I had purple hair and wore coloured contacts and because the new owner saw my old self harm scars. I was suppose to continue working but the new owner wasn't ok with my scars. I've come to this restaurant a few times after that for a quick burger and found the patty not completely cooked and the prices went up even more. My advice is to go to another location and get better customer service + food that's not undercooked or overcooked."}
{"text":"Disappointed that DQ ran out of vanilla ICE CREAM. Not sure how that happens for a place that serves primarily that kind of dessert. Will give them a shot again; hope they come through."}
{"text":"I came here awhile back, and I wont lie... I wasn't impressed. My husband and I stood there waiting for a good 3 mins or so for someone to take our order while the workers were out back goofing around doing god knows what. I don't even care what they were doing, I just wanted my ice cream. Finally one guy saw us and came up front... about damn time. I ordered my usual banana split and of course, that never fails me. My husband got his usual peanut butter reeses blizzard. Good stuff! I love dairy queen, I just wasn't impressed with their lack of work ethics."}
{"text":"We went here this evening because we bought the card that allows us to get a buy 1 get 1 free blizzards to support the boy scouts. We saw a commercial for the cookie dough peanut butter blizzard so my wife wanted to try it.  When I tried to order that blizzard the kid taking my order looked at me like I was speaking Chinese.  I also ordered the cotton candy blizzard. When I got the 2 blizzards both had ice cream dripping down the sides.  And he made the cookie blizzard wrong. I didn't say anything because the kid looked like he genuinely didn't give a sh*t. I stuck my hand all in the ice cream sided cups and left. Both blizzards were poorly made just like that kids attitude. I will NOT go here again. There are too many other better ice cream or frozen yogurt shops to choose from, like yogurt land which I highly recommend! All in all this kid had a attitude problem. Other customers noticed it because we all had talked about it while waiting. Terrible serivce. I forgot to mention, the kid was skinny and had thick blackish hair."}
{"text":"This place  isn't worth even a half star. Owner and employees are rude. Food is nasty. Store is dirty. I have lived in Mahomet for 43yrs and I hate to say it but this store needs shut down."}
{"text":"Got a medium hot fudge Sunday, I would've been better off going to McDonald's. Not much hot fudge and they charged extra for the nuts and whip cream. I would have $3 in my pocket."}
{"text":"Okay, this location was a little dirty but is the only one near my house. I recently downloaded the DQ app and it gave me a free blizzard. I came in the store today to use it because I used the in-app store locator and this was the closest one that came up.   I went to try and use this mobile coupon on the DQ app and I was told by a bunch of teenagers I could not use it because they did not accept mobile coupons. However, their online locator did not tell me whether it accepts coupons or not (which it should.) I don't think that this was a great move on their part because almost everything is digital! I mean even Yelp has check in offers some times.   I was a little upset I wrote corporate and I complained because I would like to know how I am supposed to know how a location does or does not accept mobile coupons from the company's own app!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice Dairy Queen by DQ standards. It's super convenient off the hwy. attached to a nice gas station and store with clean bathrooms and a diaper changing station.   The service was not exceptional so I can't give a 5, but they weren't horrible either. The booths look fairly new with nice cushioning.  Tables and floors were all clean. Our blizzards were great.    I don't get the other negative reviews (except for the lopsided dipped cone which was pretty bag). Maybe things have improved since the older reviews. I'd say this is a great pit stop."}
{"text":"Food is just as with every other fast food place  . The only thing that stands out is there should be a adult present .  This a teenage hang out with teenage staff. Seen a employee leave restroom after cleaning it and not wash thier hands . Looks like a special treat for somebody!!"}
{"text":"Just purchased two large blizzards. One with butterfinger and cookie dough had no cookie dough and they were blended so fine that there were no chunks or bits in it.  The other was mint with Oreo and again, no sign of Oreo. Less blending would be better. These may as well have been ice cream cones.  Michaels is better."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Associates look like they have no idea what they're doing. I've been in here about 20 minutes waiting on one blizzard. Took about 8 minutes alone just to place an order even though I was the only customer in here. Two people walked in behind me and they've been waiting just as long to place an order and to get their food for simple orders. And I've had to ask for my blizzard once again as there are a pile of receipts on the counter that no one seems to be looking at."}
{"text":"Not very well put together. Bad area in addition to staff that doesn't care. Was standing at window for five minutes while they were too busy to stop unpacking boxes to take order being only person in line."}
{"text":"The $5 lunch is a pretty smoking deal. Chicken strips or a deluxe cheeseburger, fries, a drink and a sundae. And tasty, too. There's more to DQ than just desserts."}
{"text":"When you want DQ, you want DQ, so something must really be bad to sway you from going.  That said, I definitely bring some notes to study when I go because you can guarantee a wait in the drive through.  I've been there 4 or 5 times now and every time it is the same situation -  one time the machine broke, tonight it looked like someone was training, or just a lot of cars (can't fault them for that now!).   I will say this though, the last couple times I was there the girl at least apologized for the wait, so that makes it all good in my book.   At least some of the newer generation has some awareness and good courtesy."}
{"text":"Incompetence is becoming an epidemic.  Last time I went there, I asked for a large chocolate oreo cookie blizzard.  1 mile down the road I realize they put chocolate cookie dough in it.  Then tonight, I asked for the same thing and they repeat back to me \"1 large blizzard with oreo cookie dough.\"  I said, \"NO...you did that last time and you ruined it.  I want oreo cookie.\"  Again, she repeated with cookie dough.  What part of oreo cookie has the word dough in it?!  Finally, some other guy gets on and he does the same thing.  OR-E-O  COOKIE.  Does this have the word dough in it??  NO, what the F*** is the problem?  Same thing, 1 mile down the road, I realized they made it with vanilla ice cream this time instead of chocolate."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Dairy Queen I have ever been to. So clean and tidy. The people who run it are just the best. Drive through is a +."}
{"text":"We had already paid for our food when I witnessed the following...  This location needs the owner or manager on site regularly.  Off duty employees were in flip flops walking around the back area and kitchen, seemingly hanging out and taking food that was apparently mis ordered.  The cook and cashier were using bare hands to touch the food, (I watched the cook throw a bun on a burger from the back onto the burger already sitting in the window with ungloved hands.  The cashier grabbed food from a basket and threw it in a sack before handing it off).  In addition to our burgers (which came wrong) we ordered two vanilla dipped ice cream cones.  Those took about 15 minutes to receive.  The girls were all very sweet but they needed leadership and direction.  Tables were filthy.  Ketchup bottles were empty.  This place needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a DQ blizzard? Tried and true. Old faithful. Candy and ice cream. My usual is the Butterfinger. Recently, I've been quite fond of the Chips Ahoy blend. Whatever you choose, this location will give you generous spoonfuls of toppings. The drive-thru is quick and easy. The employees are courteous, always serving up our order with a smile. Also, they're an official \"Grill and Chill,\" which means they accept most DQ coupons (unlike the \"regular\" locations)."}
{"text":"This is a brand new (or maybe newish) location.  It is on the end of a new plaza.  Which allows for a drive thur if you are in a hurry for your food.  Inside is a bit small, but it is for the most part an ice cream place.  They do have hot food as well.  Definitely worth the drive to come here.  The employees inside were really nice and made it a pleasant experience.  I only stopped here to ebb my craving for a blizzard and this place surely did suffice."}
{"text":"They flipped the blizzard upside down and big chunks fell out.   I was so embarrassed for them I didn't ask for it to be topped off I just took it and walked away.  I felt like it was not just my ice cream that hit the floor, but all the hopes and dreams of the Dairy Queen employee who had failed to properly prepare my peanut butter, cookie dough, Jurassic World movie tie in special edition Blizzard.  The service here is always bad, but you know what??? I keep going anyway. I go because deep down I know I don't deserve good service, I don't deserve a cold blizzard that is clean on the sides and I don't want one.  But maybe if I keep going.... Someday the service will get better... And maybe.., just maybe... On that day I will deserve it."}
{"text":"Just like any other dairy queen. Good burgers and chicken strips.  Edit: the last few months this place has kinda gone downhill. My mother got a rotten banana in her banana split on her birthday about a month ago, and today my popcorn shrimp basket was literally about half the amount of shrimp of last time I had this. just stick to burgers here folks."}
{"text":"This is the busiest Dairy Queen in all of Alberta and in the top 10 in Canada for sales - I kid you not; it's true.  They have 99c burgers everyday and every two weeks on a Friday they have 59c burgers.  They get 1 star not for the food (which is well nothing to brag about) but for the way the owner treats the staff and customers. I have been there a dozen of times and every time would see this one guy yelling. Well one day I got talking with one of the high school kids on a break and I got the low down of how Scott, the owner runs this place.  He routinely violates labor laws (gets dim witted kids to work 2 hour shifts when the minimum in AB is 4) and has a nasty temper. He has told customers and his staff to go to hell, and I personally saw him throwing Blizards at the kitchen staff while screaming one day.   Never in all my years have I witnessed a business owner be suck a jack @ss.   I would highly suggest any other Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"I've only been to the drive through, so I'm only reviewing this portion of service. They are always friendly and quick to get our ice cream orders. We've never ordered food, just frozen treats. the prices are getting a little high, but the yummy-ness is worth it."}
{"text":"Website says 11:00 closing time. Yelp says 10:00. Just called restaurant and they said 10:30. Guess they averaged it up."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! Robert the manager is always super nice&makes my cream exactly the way I like it. Nick is super awesome! I highly recommend this DQ!"}
{"text":"I work very close to this DQ and my husband and I come here often to enjoy their blizzards. Always have had great service and the employees have been friendly except for last night (06/05/16).  We got there at 9:30pm (the sign outside says they close at 10:30pm), we placed our order with a guy named John and when we received our blizzards, he said, \"finish your ice creams and don't dilly dally here\".  My husband was kind of surprised and asked him to repeat himself, John then replied with, \"eat your ice cream and leave, I don't want you sitting here\". WOW! we were so surprised, the place was empty, and we are not young people, I am 65, my husband is 66 and what John said to us, kind of ruined our taste for DQ ice cream forever and quite frankly we were offended.  We threw our blizzards away,  and left, with the intention of never returning here. Husband and I discussed what could have been the reason for his remarks, and all we could come up with was that he is White and we are Hispanic or he doesn't like older people. I also want to say again, prior to this visit, the employees have always been great!"}
{"text":"I can now remember why I don't come to this location.... thought it would be nice to get an ice cream cake for my husband but the people who work here are incompetent at their jobs/ don't want to serve customers. Four workers passed by and saw I was standing waiting to order but decided to ignore me. There was a wall just between us while I can hear all four of them joking and bickering about who's job it was to take my order. Super unprofessional. I actually had to yell out at the four workers If anyone is gonna service me before a fifth worker came out to take my order... mind you the WHOLE restaurant was completely EMPTY the entire time I was there. Never coming back to this location...."}
{"text":"Rude customer service.  Never going back Ordered 2 blizzards and an order of pretzel sticks (which was served in a small short cup) the pretzels were extremely hot.  It should've been placed in a bag rather than just handing it over.  While trying to figure out where to place these items I burned my arm due to it being extremely hot!  Told the girl working drive thru , and she told another coworker I'm assuming was her manager.  The guy just said that's how they are trained to serve the food.  That's it."}
{"text":"I post this having ordered a chocolate brownie royal blizzard looking into my cup only to find no brownie pieces. Not a single one. We paid $.59 for an extra scoop of them, and it doesn't appear as if any made it to the cup. The chocolate fudge that is supposed to be in the middle is not, and a tiny amount has been swirled into the top. Last time I checked, the whole point of a royal blizzard was to have a center of ice cream with one of their sauces you could mix in as you pleased. Apparently this location did not get the memo.  Dairy Queen. You have failed me when I needed you most on this cheat day. I am highly disappointed in you. The Queen Creek location should come teach you how it's done.   P.S. If you think fast good employees deserve $15 an hour, forget it. If you can't get a simple order right there's no way in hell you're getting more money than someone who actually works for a living."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when my meal did not come with sauces. I felt like they charged me for every little thing...! And when I asked for explanation, the girl was down right rude. I will not go back there and  posted this on Facebook as well. What happened to customer service? If I could have picked NO stars, I would have..."}
{"text":"The food and ice cream were good. Service was good. We left an expensive jacket that had sentimental value at the restaurant mistake and the staff made sure to keep it safe until we retrieve it. Thanks Jovani!"}
{"text":"5 stars simply for the fact that I was craving a chocolate chip cookie dough blizzard and showed up 4 minutes before closing. Although it was closing time, the staff treated me with the same energy and effort you would give (hopefully) to someone mid day. She took my order, was kind, smiled and made my blizzard to perfection. She even did the little \"turn it upside down\" trick. Thank you so much for fulfilling my craving! Sorry for coming last minute."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is the best in the world! It has two things I love ..extra delicious Blizzards made fresh with Reeses ...and My Nephew.... He rocks the shake machine."}
{"text":"It appears to be an older DQ, but not in the classic sense, more in the in need of some cosmetic upgrades (the ceiling looks like it may fall in soon) and maybe some AC improvements (the staff looked like they were sweating).  We ordered some basics, a small cone and a medium sundae. We received a medium cone and a small sundae. i was sad since i ordered the sundae but it wasn't important enough to have corrected.  Unfortunately, being the closest DQ to home may get me back there, but if possible we'd seek out another one."}
{"text":"Once again tonight out of chocolate ice cream do the northwest a favor and close down!!!!! You guys suck!!! How does an ice cream shop run out of ice cream???  Go to Golden Spoon from now on spend your money at that business!!!!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is rather old and shabby, but's because it's located next to Main Street Markham, so it matches the scene. The Dairy Queen is linked with the Orange Julius and sells savoury foods inside as well.   I used to enjoy getting cakes here, but the last time I came here, my friends and I ordered the chocolate dipped soft serve cone and five minutes into eating it, the shell cracked and the ice cream began dripping all over me and all over the sidewalk like a massive waterfall.   I eat ice cream pretty fast and this is the first time that it ever happened. This experience was worth the laugh, but it's also preventing me from wanting to visit again."}
{"text":"DQ was my treat since I accompanied my wife at the nearby Dollar Tree store. The store was busy tonite. It took the employees awhile to acknowledge us and ring up the banana split with nuts.   We were charged extra for nuts but didn't get them until we notified the workers behind the counter. They forgot the strawberries too. I'm not going to lose any sleep over the missing strawberries. My wife and I split the banana split, which was delicious. What's with those mini spoons? I felt like Gulliver eating from a spoon that was meant for one of those tiny Lilliputians."}
{"text":"I'm sure you have heard those stories from your parents or grandparents of how back in the old days they walked to school five miles in a raging snowstorm. Well I seem to remember back in the old days when I was a kid when Dairy Queen was a treat and the ice cream was so good. Way better than that stuff you get at the grocery store. Sometimes we would buy the quarts of ice cream to bring home.  So I snuck out of the office about 3pm and drove above 5 miles to the Drive Thru. This car in front of me must have ordered about a week's worth of burgers, because based on Rand's review these are the best burgers ever. It probably took about ten minutes of waiting at the Drive Thru and all I wanted was a large vanilla ice cream cone. I should have gone inside. Who would have thought the people in front of me ordered about $100 dollars worth of food.  When I finally got to taste the ice cream cone I thought to myself, what a let down. It was not any better than a Mickey Dee cone. It certainly didn't taste like it was a premium type ice cream like in the good old days. Next time I'll just get a burger."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen and make a point of grabbing some whenever I'm in town but there's still a lot of locations and I'd suggest you check out a different one.  The staff was very nice and open to giving extra hot fudge for my Oreo Brownie Sundae but it didn't seem just a \"little dirty looking.\"  Maybe a lot can happen in a year.  I actually wondered if one can get sick from unsanitary conditions at an ice cream place.    Don't give up DQ but maybe try one somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice location conveniently located right off Pottery Rd but it just sucks that there's no drive-thru.  You really can't go wrong with anything you get to eat at DQ but the funnel cakes (which I had for the first time today) was really good! Doesn't compare to the ones at wonderland but nonetheless delicious."}
{"text":"This store was clean, sharply decorated and bright. This is a combined Orange Julius and Burger Joint. It was a pleasant surprise. I can't say enough good words about the famous Blizzard. They no longer hold it upside down though, a sad break from tradition."}
{"text":"Worst dairy queen ever. Had a flamethrower meal and a peanut buster parfait and my brother had chicken strips. It all tasted super old. The bun was nasty and stale, the burgers tasted like they had been frozen way too long... Almost like cafeteria hamburgers from high school. Seriously that bad. The lettuce and tomato looked old. Just all around gross. The fries were really stale like they were cooked earlier in the day and then re-fried. Even the chocolate on the sundae tasted like it had sat too long. I would avoid this place if you value a good meal."}
{"text":"Been getting my ice cream from the drive-thru for years. Today I ordered an Oreo S'mores Blizzard. Lucky for this location I'm not allergic to nuts. I crunched down on at least four of them. No biggie, since I like nuts, but if I had been allergic this would have been a very grave mistake, so just a heads-up for everyone to be careful. Ice cream itself was delicious, although it tasted nothing like s'mores. I don't blame the people who made it though, they can only work with what they got from HQ. At least it was tasty, but people with allergies be mindful of what you get!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this particular DQ location. My boyfriend ordered an ice cream cake for my birthday as a surprise. He ordered the cake two days prior to needing it (although this location claims they only need 24 hours notice). He clearly explained to the employee that he needed the cake promptly when they opened at 10am to which she replied that would be no problem. When he went in to pick up the cake at 10:15am, it was not ready. The employees claimed that the top of the cake had not been finished, however we later realized that the cake hadn't even been made at all yet. They informed him they needed an extra 30 minutes to an hour to complete it. Two hours later, we came back to DQ to pick up the cake. It looked absolutely atrocious. It was obvious that the cake was rushed to be made as it was not frozen and the icing work was incredibly sloppy. At this point, my boyfriend was very frustrated and asked for a manager. After much conversation, the manager went to the back of the store to speak with either another manager or the owner of this franchised location. He then begrudgingly offered to take the cake back and refund the money or take $5 off the price. My boyfriend decided to take the $5 off, however looking back, we wished we would have given the cake back and taken the refund. I also found that offer quite strange because I am not sure what they would do with an already decorated cake. Regardless, these cakes are quite expensive and should always be made properly and on time. The owner of this location should be embarrassed they are selling such a poor product.  Overall, this was an extremely poor experience and we will never order another cake from this location. If you are looking to order a cake, consider the Windmill location as we ordered one from there previously and it was made perfectly."}
{"text":"Don't go to the one on Rainbow in southwest area. The employees are rude and not apologetic at all. Especially around 10am- 12 pm. A simple way to address a customer if you can't offer something is to say \" I'm sorry unfortunately we can't offer that until 11am.\" Not \" I can't do that my computer won't let me\" (with a rude tone) and then still rude because you can't hear thru the telecom. Since he couldn't hear me a female had to finish the order and she was just as rude. My suggestion is do not buy at the DQ on Rainbow.  I'm assuming they are usually servicing students so they think they can talk to people the way they do. I wouldn't even rate this location a 1 star."}
{"text":"This location is extremely slow.  If you go through the drive through, plan to wait around 20-30 mins guaranteed no matter the time of day."}
{"text":"This is a good size Dairy Queen with plenty of people working there so when you order they start making it right away.  There is no delay between the time you order, get your food and pay for it.  There is plenty of seating inside and out.  They have a full menu as well as an Orange Julius option."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best dairy queens I've ever been to . It is so clean and the blizzards are delicious. Not to mention the service was great . My family and I now make it a weekly visit :)"}
{"text":"I gotta say. I don't like dairy queen food a lot. Usually only go to dairy queen when I want something sweet. But I went there last week for lunch because I was on a time crunch and I went through the drive through and the woman that took my order was amazing! She was funny and she was extremely nice. Definitely above and beyond and regular fast food. I'm upset I didn't catch her name but I will come back here for lunch again because of her."}
{"text":"I always order a large Oreo blizzard with extra Oreos and it seems that this location is the only one that actually manages to disperse the Oreos throughout the blizzard!"}
{"text":"Well for starters it was 9:30 when we went to the drive thru. I believe they close at 10:00 pm.  At the window I start my order and after every single item it was like he wanted me to stop ordering already.. I understand I had a large other but, am I bothering you with my spending money at your establishment? The order was repeated back and all seemed correct.  My order: a mini blizzard, a medium blizzard, and a large blizzard, also a root beer float, buster bar, large coke and a sundae.  Get to the window, pay.. Wait for my order and see 3 younger guys working. One actually making my order, the other who knows, and the one who took my order was literally dancing around in plain view.   After a semi long wait I get my order and tell him I'm missing the large blizzard. Although he repeated it back some how he didn't add it to my order so no big deal I pay for it and wait for it to be made.  Get it and pull away when we notice the buster bar is missing as well!! So we go back thru and he seemed kind of irritated that HE had messed up my order twice now. Got my buster bar and before we even left the parking lot half my stuff was melted due to two screws ups and having to wait!!   My main concern is with 3 people working and no one I front or behind me, why were they not more on top of this? Wasn't a complicated custom order either.   DQ is not a place I visit often and I'll aim to keep it this way. $25 on ice cream for a terrible experience, no thank you!!"}
{"text":"Not the most quick DQ but they get the job done :) A lot of younger people work in here, they are friendly for the most part and usually patient when customers are still trying to decide what they want. They're out of certain ingredients or items a lot and the inside is pretty outdated."}
{"text":"This store is right by my boyfriend's condo, so it's somewhere we go on occasion (ok, maybe more than an occasion) to get a dessert and walk around. The actual store is quite small, and there's no seating area other than a small counter coming out of the wall to lean against.    The thing I like about this Dairy Queen is that they just do ice cream, and perhaps hotdogs (though I wouldn't buy one, I think they microwave their stuff.. I could be wrong).  They have yummy Reese Piece blizzard and hot fudge dipped cone. I wouldn't recommend eating a hot fudge dipped cone on a hot day, while on lunch at work, it can get very messy, very fast! Also I found out, after having a craving for ice cream cones, that you can get a cone (just a cone) for only $0.52! woo hoo!   From time to time they have a day where a portion of the day's sales goes towards charity.. I don't remember what charity it was, but it nice to be able to support a charity and eat your ice cream too."}
{"text":"I decided to get my family some quick lunch and ice cream for my little brother and niece,  we waited over 5 minutes in the drive through with not a word being said to us before deciding to just go in, where again it took almost 5 minutes to be acknowledged while standing at the register, just for the ice cream I had ordered a strawberry cheesecake blizzard, a banana split blizzard, a medium dipped cone, and a kids cone. The two blizzards came out first, I had looked at the cheesecake blizzard and it looked more like a milk shake, my little brother saw the multiple advertised pictures of blizzards upside down, decided to turn his upside down, immediately upon doing so the entire thing poured out onto the table. I told him to go tell the girl at the front, and they will make him a new one, considering that they advertise, \"upside down or it's free,\" the girl at the counter looked like she had no clue what was going on, she literally put her hands up and shook her head back and forth and said, \"I don't know\" another lady came up (I'm assuming was a manager, she was black, older, very short hair cut, with thick drawn on eyebrows and bright yellow acrylic nails) and asked what the problem was, I explained how my little brothers blizzard fell all over the the table when he attempted to turn it over, she asked what kind it was and I told her, and she proceeded to tell me it was whoever had made its fault, and turned and walked away. I figured that they were going to make him a new one because why else would she just randomly leave in the middle of talking to me other than to fix the problem? After a few minutes I waited and asked if they were remaking it, I was told no and then asked if I could get my money back, which of course was another ordeal in itself. The girl at the front told me that she was just an employee and couldn't help me, so I asked if someone was available that could. She said yes, and put two bags on the counter and said \"oh here's your food by the way.\" Which I won't even get into how wrong that came out. Finally the same woman I spoke to earlier came back out and looked at me and angrily said. \"so what are you doing here?\" Her attitude astounded me, the least you could do is seem like you cared in the least about guest service. Anyway eventually she refunds me the money I paid for the blizzard, and when she hands my the receipt I said thank you, which she then replied with a very bitchy, \"No.\" I get that it's fast food and you can't really expect great service, but honestly, how do you get into a management position when you treat people like they're shit? Not once did anyone say I'm sorry, or that they'll attempt to fix anything. I understand it's stupid to turn your ice cream upside down, but don't advertise upside down or it's free and then refuse to remedy the problem when a young child turns his cup upside down. My family and I will never be returning to this or any DQ location."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst Dairy Queen I have been too. Stood at the counter for over a good 5 minutes or so while the guy in the kitchen is stairs at us without helping us. I have brought my kids here a few times because it's right by their doctors office and every single time they message up their order. It's never busy but service is horrible due to the lack of customer service by these youngsters. Train on customer service and train your employees not to ignore your customers. Last time I will be coming to this Dairy Queen for sure."}
{"text":"Why is it impossible to find the hours for this location anywhere online? And they don't answer the phone. EVER. I tried to call and get the hours, but didn't get an answer in 4-5 tries, so I just went there (it was 9:30pm and it's a good 10-15 minute drive from my house). Luckily, they were still open and there were at least 5 people working. I asked why they weren't answering their phone and the kid just shrugged his shoulders. Today is Sunday and I attempted again, since many places close early on Sundays. Guess what....still no answer! So frustrating."}
{"text":"This place is really run down. The bathroom was beyond smelly and not well kept and just unpleasant to be in. Also there was a cockroach on the counter where you get the drinks. When we ordered our food out drinks were forgotten and we had to wait and the food itself was not as good as other locations I've been to. It really needs to be cleaned up. And the roach is what did it for me, otherwise I would have at least given 2 stars."}
{"text":"Food was wrong yet again I am done spending my money here is they can't even get the order right. I wanted something added to my blizzard and I paid for it and it wasn't even added. It wasn't even that good. I was very disappointed especially when they won't answer their phone when you call cause they messed up your order. Poor customer service attitudes. This place is a joke.  This is like the 4 time I keep trying to try again. I am done. I will travel to a different one of I have to I am sure they will be happy to take my money and do their job."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen shows me that it can be worth it to check out yelp reviews for large chain restaurants.  I don't like going to Dairy Queen because it's so banal but banal would be an improvement for this Dairy Queen.  It was dirtier than my men's dorm room back in college (thankfully since I cleaned up my act) and I ended up paying for an expensive orange juice masquerading as an Orange Julius."}
{"text":"Took them forever to get my simple strawberry banana smoothie done. Was only half way full but tastes really good. Made my friends banana milkshake to thick and it just tastes like vanilla. We are disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty happy with this place. Yet today I was put in ugh mode. I ended up with a delish grill burger but my kids burger was still red/pink in the middle."}
{"text":"I'm chubby... so when I ask for extra Oreo's and I pay for extra Oreo's I WANT MY EXTRA OREOS!! You guys do this at least half of the time!! Are you guys Socialist.. I work all day and pay for extra Oreo's.. and you guys take half of my extra Oreo's and give them to someone that didn't pay for extra Oreo's?? Is that how this works?? Down with socialism!! I hear Sonic is a supporter of Capitalism.. I guess I'm gonna have to get my extra Oreo's from them from now on!! You probably have Ernesto Che Guevara stickers all over your delicious ice cream making machines"}
{"text":"Great late night snack of ice cream ,ice cream,ice cream!!! I scream for Ice Cream. Not like the old DQ with all the fast food. There's like three things of fast food on there menu like chicken ,hot dog . But they got ice cream ;))) this one is clean, and all staff have seamed to be very nice"}
{"text":"If you want ice cream, skip this place. They can't seem to maintain the service of their machines. They seem to be always be breaking. Needs new management or owner."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the nicer Dairy Queen's in the area. They up-charge for cheese curds. It was an additional $1.80 on to my already pricey combo. The burger was bland. The cheese curds were just ok. The service was great and they seemed very efficient here."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen has always provided accurate orders and great service, it's a little small in size though. I don't get her often, but when I do I order the chicken tenders basket. It's the best thing on the menu.   Great Service Fair Prices Great Ice Cream"}
{"text":"This place serve me melted ice cream they will not take my coupon and the employees here are rude."}
{"text":"I've always gotten good service here and I like the camaraderie between the manager and employees.  The times I've been there it seems like a relaxed atmosphere.  I was acknowledged almost immediately when I came in and the employee was friendly and smiled (not in a fake way). That makes a difference to me."}
{"text":"The ice-cream is good but doesn't the banana split come with a cherry? My boyfriend has gone a few time for me since I'm pregnant and they have not included the cherry. :( Onion rings over cooked. :("}
{"text":"Spent nearly 15 min in the drive through line hopefully they speed it up cause I love having a location so close to home"}
{"text":"Only thing I ever get is a twist cone with rainbow sprinkles.  Always consistant and good.  Usually is a line but moves pretty quick.  Customer service leaves something to be desired.  The lady that is usually at the window is all business...you better have your order ready when you get to her."}
{"text":"This DQ has been around for years, and it's a very popular spot in this corner of Westmount - especially on warm, summer nights. The place is open late and there are always a lot of folks around: seniors, teens, young couples on dates, families with young children. Everyone loves ice cream and this is definitely the place to go.  Despite there always being a line to be served, the servers take orders quickly and make the ice creams fast, so the lines move along promptly. There are the usual Blizzards and soft-serve ice creams in cones (dipped in chocolate if one wishes). These are all consistently good. My eldest kid tonight ordered something new: a French Vanilla \"moo latte\" (essentially a coffee-like milkshake). She said this shake had a chemically aftertaste, and my younger daughter agreed. Neither wanted to drink it (which is a real rarity in our family, when it comes to anything made from ice cream!), and we ended up throwing this shake out. My recommendation would be: stick with the tried and true fare here (cones and Blizzards).  I liked how they recently put benches outside in the cul-de-sac, creating a larger outdoor space to enjoy our treats. And I liked how they also put ample trash cans outside as well."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. This is the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been too and this isn't the first time. I definitely will not to this Dairy Queen or probably any other Dairy Queen again. The first time I bring in a printed coupon for a bogo and the guy couldn't figure it out. This time I downloaded the app and it said I had either a free small blizzard or a bogo deal and it took 3 people to figure out what it even was. Than all they can tell me was sorry you need to have a printed coupon. I said to show the mobile app coupon to redeem the coupon and like I said all they could say was sorry for not knowing.   No wonder why this Dairy Queen has a 2 star rating guess I'm not the only one that's had a bad experience. Plus I was willing to just pay for the blizzard, but because none of them seem to want to help, I just walked out."}
{"text":"Great place to get ice cream! This place is filled with young workers, but they are exceptionally committed to their job! My service was fast and satisfying! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I order a Father's Day cake and I am so disappointed! Staff is not bad! The cake does not look at all like the one I ordered!"}
{"text":"Not once have they got our orders right. Even if we specifically say \"last time it wasn't right. Can you please make sure to do it \"insert instructions.\"\""}
{"text":"honestly I've tried giving this location a chance but I've had the last straw. everytime I come in they are slow as fuck, rude, and not helpful. today I ordered a large smores blizzard and what I got back was melted vanilla ice cream with 5 chocolate pieces and absolutely no other key ingredients. this girl obviously was new because she had no idea what to do on the register. I also waited in line for about 10 minutes before I was even rung up.  honestly the customer service here sucks. they don't care about the food they're serving and it's pretty annoying as a paying customer. I'm not coming to this location anymore, you guys had your chance."}
{"text":"Sign clearly states they are open until 10. We show up a few minutes after 9 and doors are locked. There is an employee outside & I ask about the sign. She tries to direct us to the drive thru. When I ask again about the hours, she states they \"just haven't changed the signs for the new hours yet.\" New hours? It's the 3rd week of March.... store hours get LONGER in the spring and summer! It's 90 degrees here already. And if your hours got shorter, how hard is it to change a sign? Clearly attention to detail is not a concern or priority."}
{"text":"Seems like great food.  Slow restaurant.  I was hungry while shopping, so I thought I'd eat here since it's been a grip since I've eaten at a DQ."}
{"text":"Got the butterscotch dipped cone which reminded me of when I was a child.  It's great how a taste or smell can bring me back in time to when I last enjoyed it.  Love their burgers because of their sauce that comes with it."}
{"text":"Love this DQ!!!! Great ice cream . New ownership is doing an amazing job!! Love the fact that this place has a drive thru!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter went here to pick up an ice cream cake for mother's day.  the total was $15.02 she had forgot her wallet but had 15.00 dollars cash she searched her car and couldn't find any change went back inside the girl behind the counter oh well that sucks and took the cake and put it back in the freezer case and walked away such horrible customer service will never visit this dairy Queen again."}
{"text":"Only great things to say about this place: had a drive thru (not too fat and lazy to walk in but ice cream and December = cold outside), they saw a dog in the car with me and they gave him his own ice cream bowl for free, and the price tag for the ice cream was overall reasonable! Would recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"This location has a decent patio with lots of shade. Getting out from the drive thru can be dicey because it's almost on the corner.   I love the moolatas and blizzards and the peanut parfait. The only problem is deciding what you want. They have the less popular pineapple malts. Not my thang, but it's my husband's thang.  I had a hot dog once here. It made me slightly nauseous. Maybe it wasn't cooked all the way? Stick to the ice cream."}
{"text":"I never have DQ but tonight I had that Blizzard urge from outta nowhere.  Smooth and easy transaction at the counter.  She was very helpful and NO band-aid in it."}
{"text":"Summary: - Ridiculously long wait time (faster to go inside) - Poor quality of food  (It will not look like you expect or be cooked right 75% of the time)  - Very small serving sizes in comparison to other DQs - Outdated interior and exterior (the place just looks unsanitary)  - Service is a toss up, (sometimes you will get very rude or staff who just don't give a crap.)  I've been going this DQ for most my life and i am honestly tried of waiting 25+ minutes (in the drive through) for food that has been getting smaller and worse in quality each year.   The drive-through is literally so bad that it is remarkable faster to go inside and order then to wait through a line that never moves.   Here you have a 25% chance the food you ordered will be made correctly or look somewhat similar to the picture advertised that's if it's not melted by the time it gets to you. Got a blizzard one time where the guy turned it upsidedown but the waited 5 minutes to give it to me and it was already melted (it was so bad that I drank it... I wanted to turn it upsidedown over the cash register)    You can literally go down the street to gastonia and get the same thing but without all the mess-ups, have it actually taste/ look good and not wait forever.   The worst part is that it has been consistently bad and the locals have no idea how bad it is because they've haven't experienced what a good DQ is like. Before I started going to the DQ gastonia I had no problem with it because I just figured every DQ was this way but No this one is just horrible.   Not to mention that the building hasn't been renovated (let alone touched) since I've been alive something 20+ years...   I don't know what the problem is with this place... I'd guess the owner doesn't really care about the place and it's a damned shame."}
{"text":"I ordered the Peanut Buster Parfait. And let me just tell you... Awesome!!  I mean how can you beat soft served vanilla ice cream, paired with hot fudge sauce and roasted peanuts??  Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum!! Lol"}
{"text":"This place a sooo out of date that it needs to be revamped hands down. The lady at the counter was nice I believe she was a Russian woman. I have no complaints about her. Good customer service. As far as the store goes it was a little dirty which I feel justifies the 3. It's a Dairy Queen what more can I expect."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the customer service at this location. The manager went above and beyond for us on a recent visit. My Blizzard mate and I came to this location to take advantage of the Blizzard promo. We advised the cashier (who also haped to be the manager) of our nut allergy and he sprung into action! First, he scanned the ingredient list to see if there were any nuts. Next, he yelled out to the crew to clean a blizzard machine and prepare to make one for a nut allergy. Hello, Captain... making your crew spring into action and taking these precautions is so above and beyond. Most places just tell us that we probably should not eat this or that. After said machine was cleaned, fresh product was brought from the back fridge/freezer to avoid cross contamination. I was so grateful and happy to see a business go the extra mile for their customers. By the way, the Blizzard was delicious!  Enjoy, patronizing a business that cares about their customers."}
{"text":"It's a Dairy Queen. It's one of the more cleanly Diary Queens in the Madison Area. The staff has always been VERY friendly and I haven't had any problems ever. Always delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow for having five employees working. Got a dipped cone and a sundae waited 15 minutes.  Get your Dilly Dilly :)  My Local DQ also has an Orange Julius so it offers a lot of variety. The drive up menu board is easy to see and easy to order from. The customer service is always friendly, service with a smile and the food is always delicious and has a good presentation. It's a bit pricey but cheaper than other places and totally worth the price.

{"text":"After have a not so great meal, we stopped for dessert! The kids loved the ice cream vanilla cones. I really enjoyed my berry smoothie.  This location also has a really good cheeseburger with fries meal, I should have had dinner here, rather than the lousy burger I had else where.  This location gives great service and the drive thru window is always busy. The sign of a good restaurant people enjoy patronizing.  Highly recommend is great, out of the way location!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here today to grab an ice cream cake for Father's Day ...  The store appeared to be clean, this particular store is bigger and carries more products than your average Dairy Queen, service was prompt and courteous, it was a very quick in and out transaction.  This location also has a drive through window and it seems to offer quite extensive hours of operation.   The ice cream cake tasted good, and hit the spot when it is super hot this time of year in AZ.  Overall, this store easily earned three yelp stars - it was a good experience.  There was nothing very good or exceptional about the interaction.  I would definitely come back here to pick up an ice cream cake in a pinch, and I would recommend others to do so as well ;)"}
{"text":"About What You Expect  I was excited to see that a DQ opened in the Goodyear area, this is always a treat for my family. We stopped in for a quick bite to eat and our expeirence was about what you would expect from a DQ.   We ordered 2 chicken strippers dinners, onion rings, and potato skins. The chicken strips and onion rings were just okay, other fast food establishments offer much better tasting chicken strips and onion rings. The potato skins were absolutely terrible they tasted old and stale.  I'm definitely not in a rush to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this location because their staff is friendly and their service is really good. Have never had a bad experience with this restaurant.   They are easy to get in and out of and not far from home, which I also like. I usually come here for desserts and the occasional comfort food.   Their loudspeaker at the order area could stand to be fixed though because at times it's hard to hear, let alone understand what the employee is asking or saying."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking and no long lines ! Staff was very friendly and courteous. Cashier was very knowledgeable  about the products on the menu and patiently answered my questions with a smile ! My large Frappe was delicious as was the Strawberry and Bannana  smoothie I sampled.  The cost was fair considering the size and quality if the products. I will definitely  return."}
{"text":"Worst customer service went in with my boyfriend they took his order and walked off to do something let two guys go ahead of me and the immature twit came back to help them when i came back to order she didnt apologize for the wait then her and her coworker stood at the register looking over and me and my bf.totally b.s. visit"}
{"text":"I am extremely upset with this Dairy Queen seems that they really don't know or understand what EXTRA means. I come here a lot and it is always a problem with them. I always get a small blizzard with extra candies and it NEVER has extra. This time I ordered a medium and since I NEVER get enough chocolate candies when I order EXTRA I decided I would order TWO EXTRA scoops which is NUTS because that is $1.38 EXTRA on top of the $5.29 for the blizzard BOTTOM line even with the 2 extra scoops I still got less candy then if I would have order it with nothing extra! Which is a HUGE disappointment and even with all that I don't even know why I waste my time on the receipts  surveys because no one reads them or if they do they don't get back to you not even with a apology email I have even emailed the main DQ about other problems I have had and they just say they will forward to owner which whoever that is doesn't care about these surveys. It is so stupid I guess I do the receipt surgery for the free Dilly bar lol for my kids but whatever overall everything here sucks you don't get what you PAY for and sucks this is the only DQ in Henderson close besides the mall !! so if you want my advice just order your blizzard and don't pay extra nothing because you WILL NOT get it."}
{"text":"As far as Dairy Queen's go, this location's a good one.  It's located in a recently (mid-2015) built plaza between Westsprings and Cougar Ridge. The new format for Dairy Queen seems to involve no space to wait around the counter. Instead, you are given a number when you order and the staff bring the food to your table, it's a nice touch.  The store is a nice walking distance to lots of residential neighbourhoods, so it makes for a nice destination for a walk in the summer."}
{"text":"After a 12hr day at work, I stopped at Dairy Queen on to get my sick wife her free small birthday blizzard and get another dessert for my daughter and I to split.  When I ordered, I let them know that I had the coupon and nothing was said about not being able to take it.  I pulled around, and the young gentleman who was cashiering asked for full amount.  I reminded him about the coupon, to which he turned to a female manager.  She came up and asked to see my phone.  NOWHERE on the information received from Dairy Queen does it say that it must be used at any specific location.  She told me that the coupon wasn't for their location.  Instead of providing great customer service, she copped an attitude and rolled her eyes at me.  \"What would you like me to do sir\" with a smirk attitude.  I was a GM of a restaurant for 7 years, and in management over 10 and I NEVER would have responded to a customer the way she did.  I understand there are policies that customers don't know about, but it is also not OUR fault that DQ didn't put a disclaimer.  I am quite shocked at this and I canceled my order.  I am considering contacting corporate, I hope all problems at the restaurant aren't responded to in such a hostile way.  She even ended by saying \"You have a great evening\" in the most condescending way.  Very disappointing to say the least.  This was a location we frequented a couple times a week; as we live just a few miles down the road, now I'll be driving to Chandler or Gilbert to give them my business. I drove over to another location and they didn't say a word about excepting the coupon."}
{"text":"Worst smoothies ever, made from dry powder but priced like premium fruits...yuck! Manager has attitude."}
{"text":"Always clean and polite!  Great food, Great management!  Food is hot and fresh!  Drinks and deserts are delicious!  Cute little outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Incase anyone was wondering since I could not find the hours of operations anywhere and they don't answer the phone when you call!  HOURS:  Mon-Sat 10a-10p Sun 11a-10p"}
{"text":"Quick and pleasant drive-thru service and standard issue DQ deliciousness - perfect dessert stop.  If you've never been to a DQ before, try a Peanut Buster Parfait - the soft-serve is delicious, the fudge is thick and creamy and the peanuts are plentful and salty - it's an excellent combination.  My husband 's favorite is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blizzard, if you're looking for a sure thing in a cup.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perfect drive-through experience: flawlessly executed PeanutBuster Parfait and large chocolate dipped cone: perfect softserve texture, excellent topping distribution and dipped, packed to travel beautifully (I drove them home, just under 15 minutes, and they were perfect upon arrival).  The service was super quick and really friendly, to boot.  I'll be back when the DQ craving calls!"}
{"text":"We went for  soft serve cones on July 11 in the early evening.  The ice cream was smooth and creamy and certainly hit the spot.  What impressed me the most was the friendly staff!  They are awesome."}
{"text":"Great location, fast friendly service!!! Open late even in the winter when you want a treat. Great community asset also!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service here. The line was almost out the door. One gal working behind the counter. Not very friendly either. Doesn't take much to smile. Waiting forever to get our order. Guess she's milking the cow. She forgot to dip my cone. DUH."}
{"text":"I just came to this Dairy Queen like 2 mins ago. I was going back because the lady at the drive thru gave me a gift card instead of my debit card back. I call them ahead of time and NO Apology at all. I go back through the drive thru, and it's no longer the same lady. She hands back my card and just say have a good day while quickly closing the window. A big slap in my face and very inconsiderate of them to not apologize for making me drive back for my debit card. I just moved to this side of town and I won't be going back. Thanks for ruining the experience."}
{"text":"I was craving a milk shake and this is near my boyfriend's job so we went for lunch one day. The food was...meh. I would enjoy a burger from just about anywhere else more. The fries were not good...soggy, not crispy, and bland. The milk shake did not satisfy my craving.   The \"$5 Buck\" lunch was a good price but the name was driving me crazy. If you say \"buck\" then do you need the dollar sign? Seems like it reads \"Five dollar Buck\" which...is redundant and doesn't make sense. But...that's not why the bad review.   There was a table of people behind us. They had a little girl with them, and I'm not good with kid ages but I would guess her to be 2 or 3 maybe? They kept walking back into the back of the kitchen with her...sometimes with a woman, sometimes a man. I assume they were the owners or something, right? None of them are dressed like they work there. They are wearing clothes that clearly don't meet health department specs...tank tops, hair hanging all over the place, open toed shoes, etc... They walked past customers in line, helped themselves to ice cream and stuff while customers had to wait to get their orders because these people were in the way. They didn't greet the customers. They didn't acknowledge the customers. That was bad enough, but then I go to the bathroom, and the little girl throws french fries over the booth into my purse. My boyfriend saw her doing it! After watching them walk around the place so rudely ignoring customers and cutting in front of them for service, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that their child would do something like that.   The only thing that gives this place the 2 stars I so generously gave was the other staff. They were suuuuuuper friendly and very helpful despite the owners getting in their way. Until the issues with the owners began, I kept thinking that even though the food was just...ok, I might start going here more often because the staff was so pleasant. Doubt I'll go back now just because I don't want to support those jerks."}
{"text":"Fast food restaurants are expected to have bad service honestly but sheesh.... This was the worst ever. Immediately the cashier had an attitude. And an even worse attitude when I asked about what's on the sandwich I was ordering. Asked for a receipt and told \"we don't have them\". Coworker given a combo with no fries then employee rolls eyes and says fine. She did bring the fries while mumbling that he didn't order it but he could have them anyway. Could have confirmed but we couldn't have a receipt."}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've been to dairy queen I didn't even know what to order! I'm a Cold Stone kind of guy but hey my friend wanted to go to DQ for a change so I thought what the hell? Sure why not! When we walked inside it was pretty slow only one other customer dining in and another ordering! We were greeted friendly by one of the younger workers and she also made our order. Multi-tasker huh? I guess! I had asked about some of the creations you can normally get at Cold Stone but unfortunately they don't have those same ingredients that I need but I made it work! Turtle Pecan Cluster Blizzard in a Large cup please! I also added cheesecake because I can lol. So all in all I am glad that I didn't get that same negative experience that everybody else seemed to get! Glad I caught them in a good day! Compared to the other Dairy Queens that I've been too this one is probably the cleanest! I like to look at the surrounding of a place before I order any food from them so in my book at LEAST they got that part right and oh my ice cream was delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for a quick lunch & each time it's been worse.  Today we ordered a BBQ & Chicken sandwiches.  Took 10-12 minutes & then told the Ciabatta bun was substituted with a pretzel bun because they ran out.  In the meantime  two groups of kids came in, loud & grabbing on each other - maybe two of the group actually ordered something while everyone else loitered around.  Another group of moms & kids came in & they were left @ the counter waiting for service for over 5 minutes.  Another group of kids sat outside talking with no sign of drinks or food.  Store is marginally clean, doors full of fingerprints & smudges.  Music sucks!  Need a responsible manager on site to monitor service, cleaning & loiterers, & pick better music!  I feel sorry for the owner because this place could be a gold mine..."}
{"text":"Honestly I'd rather spend the extra $1.50 and take my money to cold stone. Dairy Queen quality is just so low budget tasting to me. You can't go from eating cold stone on the regular to transitioning to Dairy Queen! Back paddling much? Hey but in all fairness the ice cream was good for what it was worth and it's close to my house so I suppose when I'm feeling lazy this can be a back up to help cure those late night ice cream cravings! They seem to always be having a bunch of deals going on with the food there! The staff is all young here so don't expect completely professional service because everybody was texting and probably taking selfies while I was waiting to place my order in the drive thru.."}
{"text":"I like this location. Easy in, Easy Out. Old carhop atmosphere. Iconic old building. Nice service. Good Food"}
{"text":"Went here for Miracle Treat Day today and everyone was very helpful. I had a big chariot and the staff helped me to hold the door open. It was very clean and very fast to order and get my great food just the way I ordered it. I was making changes to my blizzard and they allowed them all.  They have some tables, not a lot, but some and only two picnic tables! That's why this Dairy Queen loses a star just because they didn't have quite enough seating :)"}
{"text":"I love this place but the ac is broken and my icy cream was melted by the time I got out the door.  No joke more of it on my hands than my mouth. Sucks its hot in az and the ac broke but they shouldn't have been selling ice cream.  I just feel bad for the employees working in that heat"}
{"text":"Very cool staff and best place to Make your kids birthday cake! Taste amazing and always is ready on time! The girl that decorate her cake did an amazing job better than expected.   They're open till 11 o'clock for a night treat!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 or 5 times and there food is constantly gross.  The place is ran by nothing but kids and although they are nice I can't eat anything they make. I've tried going on different days, hours, buying different things but it's always nasty.  I once bought a double cheeseburger which was burned and I couldn't finish it. Another time I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger and it was dry. The bread felt like I was chomping on crackers it just sucked the moister out of my mouth.  Their blizzards and shakes are always watery when every other location I've ever been too has nice this shakes and blizzards.  I've tried them repeatedly trying to save money on gas by not driving further but I think 5 times is enough to say I will go anywhere but here. I'm so upset this place failed me yet again and wasted my money."}
{"text":"Well here goes another *1* star review!  How do I get into these places?  I LOVE Orange Julius and have been going to them since a very long long time ago.  If I am in a mall and see one, I always need to buy one and drink it while shopping...YUM!  Here in the food court at Aliante Station I found the Orange Julius stand mixed-in with Dairy Queen.  There were about 4 people in front of me and we were all just standing there when I spotted the sign on the counter which read \"back in 5 minutes\".  OK, everyone deserves a potty break.  But, this 5 minutes turned into 10, then 15, and I was dang hungry for their hot dog and orange drink.  Finally I gave-up and went down the row of fast foods available.  No, didn't want a taco, or Chinese food, or another hamburger, or pizza - dang, I just want that hot dog and drink!  I went back to OJ and stood for another few minutes when finally the \"crew\" came laughing back in.  Who knows where they had been.  Oh, boy, I'm close to getting my hot dog and drink!  The people in front of me ordered and finally it was my turn!  I looked at the girl taking the orders and said, \"I would like a hot dog, w/mustard and relish, and a medium Orange Julius.\"  \"We are out of hot dogs.\" was the reply.  You have got to be kidding!  But she was going to make my Orange Julius, and one for my husband.  I couldn't wait until she handed it to me and said, \"That will be $10.36.\"  $10.36!  Are you kidding me.  With a very straight face she just said, \"No.\"  $10.36 for 2 medium Orange Julius'!  So pick me up off the ground!!  Will I go back?  Are you kidding?  I went to Johnny Rockets and got myself a very good hot dog, and savored every sip of the most expensive Orange Julius I have ever had.....Actually it really wasn't that good........."}
{"text":"My cone was not drippy at all tonight, and it had way more ice cream than usual.  This Donald S guy must be crazy!  He is right about the entrance/exit debacle, however."}
{"text":"Asked for a burger plain. Got the burger, wasn't plain. Asked for it made again, plain. Got the same burger, nice and re-charred, and STILL not plain. Asked for a refund. Won't be back, dismal customer service."}
{"text":"The ice cream is always good, but I can say the same about the food. The last day we went to eat there, the owner was screaming at one worker in front of the costumers. We found that extremely disrespectful!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has gotten mediocre reviews. I used to be a total Blizzard fanatic, visiting every Dairy Queen in the Madison area (and, OK, wherever I traveled around the states, which I do a lot). This Dairy Queen, and the one in Sun Prairie, are tied for number 1 anywhere. This Dairy Queen, on Fish Hatch in Fitchburg, has a great, fast, friendly staff. The Blizzards are great. It is not in the greatest neighborhood (at least for the Madison area), which I guess makes it stand out even more. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As a recovering Blizzard addict, I must admit visiting every Dairy Queen in the Madison area, and many others throughout the US. After my extensive problem, which I freely admit, I hereby attest that the Sun Prairie Dairy Queen is tied (with the Fitchburg Dairy Queen on Fish Hatchery, near the Beltline) as the No. 1 Dairy Queen in Southern Wisconsin, and perhaps the world.  The staff is so nice I'm almost embarrassed. They make me think that people in Sun Prairie are the nicest people anywhere, but perhaps it's just at DQ. They're fast. And, I guess most importantly, the Blizzards are truly great.  If I have one complaint (and I guess I do), what's with the weird drive through, with the blind corner, that immediately shoots you out into the street? It's impossible to park there and eat, and once you pull out, there's nowhere obvious to eat anywhere close. This problem should be fixed. But everything else? Really great."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for a strawberry sunday and a banana split. We used the drive through and they were pretty quick. Typical young kids working the window but they did okay.  Neither item was served with nuts. I thought that was typical. But we didn't ask for any and they didn't ask us if we wanted any. No big deal though."}
{"text":"All hail the Queen of Dairy! We bow down in your royal honor...but mostly, I praise your highness because of your mouthwatering banana splits. How I have missed those three mountains of soft serve goodness topped with chocolate, strawberries, pineapple and whipped cream surrounded by a whole banana. Your dipped cones, Blizzards, and sundaes are pretty splendid as well. Thank goodness the drive-thru here is so speedy because today is a cheat day and I can't wait no more! Whoa, the calorie count on a banana split is only 530 -- even better! Yes, the super polite DQ employees make the visit a breeze. Now, please hand over that delicious cold treat that I've been craving."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst DQ ever....I have lived in Mahomet a year and tried this place 5 times now, each time hoping it would prove better than the last visit and that it was just an off day and today was my last visit. I've had 5 year old fries, raw burgers & today I handed my smore blizzard back asking where the chunks were.... Only to have it handed back with literally 2 in it..... I hate this place it's disgusting. Management doesn't give a crap Bc they have no competition so they continue to get away with this."}
{"text":"Came to this location after baseball tournament on Saturday night. The business closes at 10 PM. We came in at 930 and staff was rude. We wanted food but they said grill was closed down. So we ordered ice cream only.  The staff turned the music up full blast in the lobby area to get us out at 10 PM instead of coming to let us know that they were closing. There are too many choices these days to treat customers this way."}
{"text":"The cashier, an older woman, became disgruntled with her younger male co worker Infront of many customers that stood in line behind my boyfriend. My boyfriend being a former employee of Dairy Queen still paid and just left with the items he ordered being thrown together.  I barely had actual ice cream in my banana split, and the whipped cream wasn't whipped cream."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst DQ.  The staff had made me wait far too long just to take my order.  To be honest it appears that there is zero adult supervision.  I don't begrudge these kids for working at DQ, there are absolutely no procedures at this place.    At one point my step daughter walked up to the door after walking about a mile to get there and was told they were closed.  The issue is the girl rushed to the door only to close the door and lock it in her face.    I refuse to give this place my money and will take my ice cream cravings elsewhere.  Mitchell's isn't far up the street and the ice cream there is far superior to this place."}
{"text":"Wasn't going to write a review originally, but now I must. Came to this Dairy Queen the other day to get dessert. We got our blizzards, one was fine. The other tasted like there were iron filings in the ice cream. It was absolutely inedible!!! We asked for a new one and it was same. Tried to explain to the staff what was wrong and got the deer in the headlights looks from them. So, we left.   Today we go back for dessert again. Went through the drive thru and they got our orders all wrong. Not even close. We went back through the drive thru to try and correct the order. They STILL got it wrong. I don't know what the issue is at this Dairy Queen but I won't be back."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the door, you will notice that this place is spotless! The staff is extra friendly and the service is fast. The burgers are average for a DQ but they have excellent fried cheese curds that remind me of Wisconsin! Their ice cream is thick and you can tell they don't use a lot of air like so many other DQs I have been too. It was so good that we had to return the very next day!"}
{"text":"Attempted to order an Orange Julius in the drive thru. No one ahead of me but it took 10 minutes. Guy one sits drink on counter and spills it as i hand him my coupon.   He disappears and another kid comes up scoops said drink into cup, goes to back and I see him top off the drink and come back to the window.   As he wipes off the cup I say, you're not about to hand me that right. He's like i just made it. LIES! I saw you scoop up the spilled drink. He gets pissy and says ok ill make you a new one. NO WAY.   They got be f*cked up if they think I'm gonna trust him to make me a drink after that. Needless to say i drove off. Kinda pissed they took my coupon but happy they ain't getting a dime from me.   And these people expect more than minimum wage."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is a timeless classic and is a must visit for any true Ice-Cream lover! Their blizzards are to die for, and there is nothing else like It!! While I have never eaten the food, and I am not sure I would, but It is worth the trip for the ice cream alone!! My personal favorite item is the banana split blizzard, It has all the best flavors and is not to overwhelming!! I would highly recommend that, as well as the chocolate extreme!!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent this DQ but won't again. I'm tired of paying extra for extra toppings in a blizzard to get what seems like less than the norm. Tonight was final straw, I won't be back. Seems like they just over charge for you to only get home to realize you can't even taste anything but ice cream. What a waste."}
{"text":"This is your typical Dairy Queen. It's in a pretty bad neighborhood and located right next to a smoke shop so there's always somewhat strange people hanging around outside of the front door. There is no drive through either. The service is fine as is the food and ice cream. The real reason I wanted to write this review is because I wanted to award this place with the worlds slowest credit card machine. I'm telling you I waited like 5 full minutes for that thing to process my payment. They let me know that's normal and how it always is. Jeez. Time for an upgrade!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been here several times. Each visit has been disappointing, but today just really irritated me. We went to drive thru, and hardly got a response from the person working. She didn't confirm our order or acknowledge the last two items we ordered. She told us our total would be at the window.   When we pulled up, she just looked angry to be there. She confirmed our order, but one item was wrong so we repeated the order back to her correctly. She didn't confirm the items and instead just gave us the total due and slammed the window shut. Literally slammed.   We ordered 4 blizzards and a dipped cone. She tipped one blizzard sideways, not upside down. I don't usually care about that, but when it's 105 outside, I'd like to be sure my ice cream isn't already melted. She put everything in a drink tray and gave us the dipped cone. We drive away and open our blizzards to find that they're already half melted. The dipped cone was melting soon after and beyond soggy on the actual cone.   We were hot and wanted our treats so we started to eat them. But soon they were all soup! We got home not 5 minutes after receiving out items and had to toss the dipped cone. We put everything else into the freezer to harden. The nasty customer service combined with the below average ice cream served makes me want to skip out on this DQ location, once and for all."}
{"text":"This is a great place for our family to order ice cream cakes for birthday parties,  get an après sushi dessert fix (Kinjo's is beside this DQ), and snack on Blizzards and sundaes when we stroll down to Dalhousie Station.    The staff are pleasant and efficient, and the place is relatively clean."}
{"text":"Worst DQ ever.  Ordered mini blizzards, waited in the drive through  line only to get to the window and be told they were out of mini blizzard cups. So i said just put them in small cups and the girl just said no we cant do that.  Really?  So they'll just turn business away?  Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Bummer.  Sux when you have a place you just can no longer go back to , just out of principle; since the employee who's in charge just has no idea how to handle customer service.  We've been here dozens of times with our six kids.  We always get kids cops with sprinkles for the younger kids.  This time, after our large order for 10, we found that the kids cups were WAY smaller then they ever have been. Literally there was maybe 1 to 2 teaspoons of ice cream in the bottom of the to-go cup, and maybe a half of teaspoon of sprinkles.       No big deal, maybe they made a mistake. So I asked if they would top them off a little bit, and the person in charge tells us,\"I don't know what to tell you, that's the size, you can buy larger \".  So either they're really terrible at consistency, because the last two dozen times it was probably three times that amount of ice cream, or they just have ridiculously small quantities for exorbitant prices for the kids cups. (Over $2)     We left there saying, we could just go to McDonald's and get ice cream five times that size for over half the price for the kids from now on.  Sorry Dairy Queen, you forced us to look elsewhere, and you lost our business for everyone."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen and their blizzards are obviously amazing, but this review is going to go much deeper than this. This review is going to talk about their blizzard ice cream cakes. Yes you read that right. Blizzard ice cream cakes! For my husband's recent birthday, I opted for his annual ice cream birthday cake but this year, we live in a different area which means the Baskin Robbins ice cream cake wasn't going to cut it. I had heard about the Dairy Queen ice cream cakes, so I decided to give it a try. Blizzard cakes take 48 hours prep time because they are made to order, but I promise you it is worth the weight! I ordered the peanut butter cup blizzard cake. The verdict? My husband was thrilled and so was I! The cake was the perfect combination of ice cream, blizzard mixture, peanut butter cups and fudge cake. If you need a cake for a special occasion, remember that Dairy Queen offers much more than just drive through frozen treats. They also sell delicious cakes!"}
{"text":"Tried to purchase a ice cream cake. I waited 20min to ask a manager how fresh the cakes were, gave up and left. Suggestion.... All employees should be aware of how often cakes are put out. Here's a simple solution DATE the CAKES!!! To the manager who can't multitask and provide customer service. Make yourself available for customer questions. Sheesh  The cakes didn't look that great anyway. Where's the nearest \"Baskin Robins\""}
{"text":"Came here for a large chocolate dipped cone and a lemon lime slush on a blazing hot summer day. Cashier signal me to step aside and give way to the person behind me to order while I was waiting for mine. So, I politely yielded the way and stood at the far end in the corner. Only to see the gentleman who ordered after me didn't move at all, everyone else was crowding in front of the counter and I was singled out to not get in the way. Cashier yelled out my order and never attempted to identify whose order was it. She handed out my dipped cone to the gentleman at the counter without asking, and that man took it without any hesitation whatsoever. Only then I confronted him about it before taking it back from his hand. I later found out he didn't even order a dipped cone. What's going in this store?"}
{"text":"Had to wait 15 minutes for a cherry dipped cone, to go. Both the person helping us and the manager had a extreme attitude when I asked for my money back Bc I had a melting ice cream cake. Wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"I have never received worse service. I was overcharged in the drive thru. The person running the drive thru knew she had overcharged me and did nothing to rectify the situation. I called the store 6 different times and there is apparently never a manager present in this store. I left messages twice and they were never returned. I finally drove all the way back to the restaurant and big surprise, there's no manager. They said \"sit and wait, she'll be right back.\" I sat there for 30 minutes before the manager showed up. Her answer: \"oh sorry. I don't know if you know but that drive thru register has an issue where it does that sometimes. They should know how to fix it.\" Ok 1. How would I know your register has an issue? 2. If you know it has an issue why aren't you doing something about it? And 3. Clearly your employees have no idea how to fix anything. I finally had to dispute the transaction with my bank because they clearly have no intention of making things right. Beware if you go here. Check every inch of your receipt. Actually make them repeat every single item on your receipt before paying them. Or better yet, don't go here at all. Service is terrible and they just don't care."}
{"text":"Still one of the best ice cream cakes around. Employee was very helpful with my order over the phone and cake was excellent as usual. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This location has good service and the dining lobby is very clean. The ice cream tastes delicious."}
{"text":"If you order a blizzard through the drive through why the HELL would you not put a lid on it!!!! Had to request a lid 3x before they would give me and my blizzard melted all over my car before I even got home. Maybe you should hire people with common sense."}
{"text":"Ordered a birthday cake from here. While the cake I'm sure is good,  the decoration is so poor! My kids could have done better! You guys should get some training for your employees."}
{"text":"I got the Brownie Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough blizzard. Waaay too many brownies, only a couple cookie dough bites. I also had a stomachache from the ice cream and was sick the next day! First and last experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend placed an order at 10am for her sons birthday cake. It was supposed to be an 8 inch monster truck cake.  She's a working nurse, but still found time to call during her shift around noon to confirm if the cake was ready. She was told the cake was indeed ready for her to pick up.   After her shift around 4pm she went to pick it up. She was told that they had already sold her cake to someone else by mistake. They also told her that they don't have anymore 8 inch monster truck cakes, only the bigger sizes.   You would think that since they made the error selling the reserved cake, they would give her the bigger size for no additional charge. But instead they only offered a partial refund and a new cake with a different theme.   Terrible customer service. The cake they gave looked very half-assed. Very disappointed they messed up a 4-year olds bday cake."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen. I grew up next to one that closed n the winter. Until I moved away then it became a full Blazer. This one is not that one. Same great ice milk. You know it's not ice cream, don't you?  And they do offer micro-food, hotdogs BBQ and such. And it's is in need of a makeover.  Still, it's a Dairy Queen and it's the best."}
{"text":"In other provinces, they used to make something called a Mr. Misty Freeze. I was one of those colourful slushies with a nice portion of frozen custard which was then blended. The ice remained somewhat grainy, and 'brain freeze' was almost guaranteed.  Now my fare consists of the Blizzard which is delicious. A great place for  late in a hot evening just strolling aroud."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and they don't make things to spec.  Ordered a large cone and they charged me for it but gave me a medium.  I've been going to dairy queens since I was a kid and I'm 46 years old now.  I normally order a medium or a large cone and I know the difference between the two. If I pay for a large I want a large.  I told the young lady that the cone was medium not a large, she says well I've been working here for 9 years and that's how it is made.  I've been going to this dairy queen since I have been in NC 12 years and the service has always been with a poor attitude.  I asked for the owner's phone number and they wouldn't give it to me.  I asked when would the owner be in the store and they said that she never comes into the store.  I replied I'm sure she would want to know what is going on in her store and they replied oh she knows we already called her.   Owners please stop leaving your businesses in the hands of teenagers, they don't care about your customers or your business.  Their attitudes and poor service is a real turn off and a deterrent for going there."}
{"text":"like my wife said (and the only other 2 reviewers), Hey, it's Dairy Queen. so tasty and refreshing when it's 100 degrees out. thing about dairy queen is they go to an area where there's no other fast food and they dominate!   i had the pumpkin blizzard which was extremely delightful. since we had to wait longer than like 5 minutes, they comp'd us a medium instead of the mini we ordered. my gal got the mint oreo but i didn't try it because i was gluttonizing in my own frosty treat."}
{"text":"Purchased 2 small blizzards for $3.99 each. In one of them, the ice cream was so low that you couldnt even see it above the rim.  I kindly addressed my concerns with the manager (Jeremy) informing him that i make this same purchase regularly & showed him the huge difference in the 2 small blizzard. Never mind the fact that the blizzard has a mound shaped lid- not a flat one like a regular soda cup- so it even looked weird. He immediately became extremely irritated -saying \"that is how the blizzard is supposed to be!!! He never even acknowledged that i had a problem, he didnt apologize or offer to remake it, was very DISMISSIVE in front of our daughter (the real DQ fan).  When i saw that he was upset, i didnt feel comfortable even asking for a refund, so i just said, \"Ok, thank you.\" He didn't reply, he just SLAMMED the drive thru window shut! Weirdest (&worst) experience EVER with any manager in any field. I would give them ZERO stars if this were possible!!!"}
{"text":"Not the burgers I remember from DQ.... What happened to the flame broiled? Service is weak... Nice but slow, slow, slow..."}
{"text":"You know how they have that policy where if it isn't served upside down you get it served free? Well let's just say she looked me in the eye and made sure she didn't turn it upside down. I wouldn't have either. It would have been all over the floor. Now it's in my freezer."}
{"text":"Got me an Oreo Cheesequake Blizzard & it was great!  It's also buy 1 blizzard at reg price & get the 2nd of = or lesser value for .99!  As for the store experience... Typical chain. Ya know what to expect. They were courteous & pretty quick."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I come here the quality of everything has gotten worse. I bring my kids here for \"daddy dates\", today I ordered a mini banana split blizzard and a cheeseburger. The burger had ketchup, mustard and pickles on about 30% of the burger and the blizzard was about 90% ice cream. Disappointed yet again."}
{"text":"I just want to give a shout out to Rhonoah ! My girlfriend and I went and ordered a brownie blizzard and a cookie dough blizzard and this amazing person was just so great !! She made us feel so special and welcomed ! We have never gotten any coupons or anything and she was the first person to ever give us one ! We really appreciate her and wish all employees were just like her ! She really needs a raise lol ! Thank you for having that awesome attitude ! We will be back because of her !"}
{"text":"Doesn't serve food. Thats what sucks. If your looking  for food Mc Donald is across the st."}
{"text":"Ordered the m&m pizza.   Man it surely doesn't look like the picture they had on the sign...   I don't even know if this is what I ordered. What is it DQ??"}
{"text":"Love my Dairy Queen.  Usually for a blizzard.  Fast and delicious keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"So, these guys literally microwave EVERY SINGLE hamburger they sell yet it's impossible to get hot fries. What the he'll man? Be better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"It's Dairy Queen-- smoothies w a boost protein or banana. I'm a single rider so I brought my bike inside--  they didn't say anything yet-- sshhhh. Kid food here but salads available too. Clean facilities and it's right before a 6% climb up warm springs. Cool off for 15 minute/ snack here then get back on the road."}
{"text":"I hate when they flip blizzards. This location holds their fingers over the top, actually touching the food. When I asked her to remake it and not flip it, she gave me attitude."}
{"text":"Love this place they make the best burger and fry its always fresh and hot. I always get a banana split to end my week and it always makes me happy."}
{"text":"It's your standard Dairy Queen. Delicious crappy for you food we all grew up on. Remember getting sundaes in little baseball helmets?"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food yet but you can't go wrong with the ice cream! The staff is friendly and very helpful, clean environment, and delicious food. Apparently this DQ is the highest grossing DQ in Ohio!"}
{"text":"I usually go through the drive-thru here... and after walking inside, you'd probably be better off going through the drive-thru as well.   It's really old and dated inside and they have a really large dining area. I found out that they sell ice cream cakes here which is kind of cool. They've got some in a freezer that you can just pick up inside and there was also a sign that said you could special order ice cream cakes as well...good to know.  I don't go here often, and I'm not super huge on their food - but it's quite nice to treat yourself to some ice cream once in awhile!"}
{"text":"Place was great. Staff was friendly, greeting, and efficient. Even thanked us for our business on our way out. My only compliant was the place was a little too small, gets crowded easily (pretty much all Dairy Queens are). Other than that, Awesome service!"}
{"text":"We pull up to the drive through at lunchtime to get a burger. After waiting quite awhile the guy comes to the window and says\" im sorry but we forgot to thaw out any buns, would you like it without a bun?\" WTF!!! Better skip this DQ!!"}
{"text":"Came to this Dairy Queen a couple nights ago with my husband. HORRIBLE. There was a roach under the table I was sitting at and the customer service was awful. Rude staff, filthy bathrooms, all around not a good place to go. And the prices are outrageous. I ordered a small cookie dough blizzard with extra cookie dough and I only got maybe 8 pieces. Me and my husband are never coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location and each time I've been here I get outstanding service. I enjoyed eating my banana split and my daughter enjoyed eating her turtle pecan cluster which is a must!"}
{"text":"Seems I agree with many other reviews for this DQ location.  Rude, unattentive employees, long wait times and god forbid you want them to turn the Blizzard cup upside down before handing it to you...oh wait...they can't do that because their Blizzards are all melted and watery - YUCK!!!  There is a location on Cave Creek Road and while a bit out of the way...much. much friendlier service and nice texture on the Blizzards (actually frozen) so well worth the trip fellow Blizzard Lovers!"}
{"text":"Good customer service, but the two Butterscotch Dipped Cones we received looked horrible, and tasted bad.  The vanilla ice cream itself was good, but the butterscotch was orange and tasted nothing like butterscotch! Chunks of it were falling down the ice cream (see my photo), instead of being smoothly dipped.  Definitely not worth the $6 we paid...Ishould have gotten a blizzard to try..."}
{"text":"I love Blizzards! Hard to not right? I dislike Dairy Queens. They are all dirty and dingy. They are all stuck in this 40 year old motif and feel that never ever changes. I wish they would just get a drive thru so I didn't have to go in and see the filth! But, I suffer on for my tasty little Blizzard love..."}
{"text":"When  I was in the drive threw with my daughter and friend we finished ordering and as we pull up you can hear the manager outside yelling at his employee over something. Didn't really mind it till we got to the window . the lady that was helping us didn't great us nothing didn't even say our total again just waited for the money . after that when we got our change back again nothing no thank you zero her overall attitude was disgusting. Everytime I go here the employees look and act miserable ."}
{"text":"I tried to stop in here to get one soft serve vanilla dish and one chocolate dish.  They were out of chocolate soft serve. Dairy Queen only serves two flavors of ice cream so this is fairly unacceptable. There was no sign or indication so I waited in line for fifteen minutes to find this out.  The inside has a decent size freezer case and seats, and the parking lot is large."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write this review for awhile but forgot about it until my son asked to go to DQ.  We bought a DQ ice cream cake for a birthday in November from this location, and found that they didn't put any fudge filling in the centre...just the cookie crumbs. We informed this location of the oversight and were told that the cakes don't have fudge in the centre layer, which for anyone who's ever had DQ ice cream cake knows is not true. Sorry you guys...you're not fooling anyone.  I assume this location is a franchise, so I am shocked the company hasn't taken more measures to have them do a better job upholding the brand. The store is filthy, the staff are scruffy and rude, and the quality is subpar.  To the management/owner, you should keep in mind who your customers are. Like it or not (and it seems to be not), Aurora is a changing community with lots of new families who will make things like going out for Blizzards a family outing. Don't alienate them by offering a dirty store and staff that aren't nice to children. Most of the birthday cakes you make are for kids, and cutting corners disappoints them on their birthdays. This doesn't go unnoticed by the many parents who buy the cakes and attend the parties.  When I saw a Groupon ad pop up for this place, it reaffirmed my thoughts about the negative experience we had. When you are the only DQ that needs to resort of Groupon to sell ice cream cakes in the summer, you are doing something wrong.  We never go to this location now, despite it being the one closest to our home. If we really want DQ, we make the drive to the Tower Hill or Newmarket locations."}
{"text":"This location is consistently great with their customer service! My wife and I come here 2-3 times per month and we are always satisfied with the quality of the food and ice cream! They have a customer appreciation day once per year and the total is half off! The only thing that could make this location any better is if the employees smiled more"}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised at some of the earlier reviews. I have been to this DQ a few times and have never really had a bad experience. Nothing to warrant a four star rating either, though. Just middle of the road DQ. They seemed to be sufficiently staffed and I was in and out quickly. They were a few patrons in the dining area enjoying their treats and don't one in front of me in line upon arrival. They somehow messed up the first attempt at my dipped cone and tossed it in the circular file. So what if it's not pretty? It's only soft serve and I would have eaten it anyway. I guess it's all in the presentation. I got a Double Chocolate Cookie Dough Blizzard for the Mrs. and stole a few bites. As always, it was some kind of tasty. All in all, it was a decent end to date night."}
{"text":"Open February-October. I usually go for a snack during the week. Good assortment of cakes and cupcakes.  I swear their hamburgers taste the best out of all DQs. We always have a count  down in January for when they reopen."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, I thought maybe it was just a bad day when I moved on this side of town and wanted a blizzard, however 4 visits later and unfortunately it's just poor customer service as well as having other flavors in my blizzard leading me to believe they aren't cleaning their blenders between orders, so gross, won't be going back, have to find a new place for my sweet tooth nearby, I hope the owner cleans house but based on reviews I've read and there's still a problem I highly doubt it, to bad, could be a great location if wasn't being run by a bunch of misfits. Adding to post, husband won't stay away due to lack of options, here's his Oreo blizzard where's the Oreos"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Dairy Queen that is as slow as the one in Mesa on the 60 and Higley Road!!! Ever since they have opened it has been insanely ridiculous wait times to the drive-through! If you want to eat your ice cream before it melts do not go to this Dairy Queen!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been a regular customer for about 10 years+ and I have never had a problem arise until today. My family enjoy having Dairy Queen's ice cream cakes because the different layers that it offers and it's simply delicious and perfect for their prices!  I have a pretty big family so we go through a lot of cakes in just one year. At the beginning of this month their freezer was not working for the regular ice cream cakes. But the freezer for the blizzard cakes was working. We were given the option to get a blizzard cake instead. We were content and happy that the Dairy Queen workers apologized explained what had happened and we understood that this happen! :)   Today, we came back for another regular cake and there were some cakes that were melted but marked as 50% off, we were not interested. Anywho, we picked out a regular 8 in. cake from the back freezer, paid, and was waiting for the manager to come and write on the cake. Well, let's just say, our cake was suffering from waiting for so long (about 25 minutes) then she finally took the cake back. She took forever. We were standing by the counter waiting and she came out 15 minutes later to go back to the freezer in the front and she said \"I dropped the cake.\" Okay, first off, when you're dealing with customers, you need to apologize, it will show that you actually care about your customers. Then, she just went and got a 10 in. cake ( that was partially melted) and told us \"the least I can do is upgrade it to a 10 in.\" When you give the customer that option, please do not give me a melted cake, that is unfair. So finally she gave me a good 10in. cake from the back.   I was a little upset today especially when it all came from \"the manager.\" We used to drive a little farther from our home for this Dairy Queen for their ice cream cakes even though we live right next to a Baskin Robbins. We might not return because of this incident but we will see. I enjoy their ice cream cakes too! The young girl that helped us was understanding and great! The manager disappointed me that she did not put forth her proper manager skills. The least she could do was apologize."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would.  Customer service is beyond horrible. \"Tom\" who claims to be head manager is about as intelligent as a 10 year old.  We ordered a Recess Medium Blizzard (we got an Oreo) we ordered a Medium tripleberry Julius we got a strawberry banana and it was the second one WRONG a mini peppermint blizzard (Oreo). Called to tell \"Tom\" the issue and he said no we made it correct and I was \"watching\". Well I wouldn't waste your money at this Dairy Queen a simple order such as this is a difficult task and management is beyond rude."}
{"text":"As far as DQs go, I like this one.  The service is consistently good and friendly.  The blizzards are always on point.  It's not the newest, cleanest store you've been to, but it gets the job done.  If you need a blizzard fast, this is your place."}
{"text":"Friendly fast service. The best fast food hamburgers. A sparkling clean restaurant. Yeah those all add up to five stars for this DQ."}
{"text":"The reason that I didn't give this 3 stars is because of the drive thru. We were the second car in line, and it took us almost 10 minutes to go through! we stopped here on our way home after my husband had surgery, to get Blizzards. They were standard for what DQ is, but again, the drive thru was a bit annoying!  We didn't go inside, so I have no review of that."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars because it was a super long wait I was craving a cherry cheesecake Blizzard which is like my all-time favorite favorite it was very very good. I like that this location is very close by and that they have extended hours I'm not a fan of their food I think it tastes gross just stick to ice cream which is what."}
{"text":"Went to this new DQ.  This place is Nice!  There is even a nice little seating lounge with a TV while you wait for your ice cream.   So glad to see a DQ in the Goodyear area.  Only reason it was a 4star is because my blizzard wasn't mixed well.  About half of it was just vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen would have five stars if it was located closer to home. The cookie dough blizzard will always be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Enjoy this location with a drive thru and they give local discount with my badge from my employer, since they are nearby.  I appreciate that they appreciate us, it speaks volume of the owners.  Our DQ near our home doesn't have a fryer and my kids love the french fries and cheese curds here....I know funny, but its worth our drive.  They are always fast and friendly as we usually use the drive thru as we are always on the go. Writing this review is making me hungry for a Snickers blizzard. :)"}
{"text":"I remember being a kid and getting to go to dairy queen on rare occasions. It was always magical to go there! The fond memories of dilly bars and blizzards danced in my head as i walked through the door.  I gotta say, it took10 min in line to see staff ring up three orders...not sure why. I saw three employees trying to figure out how to ring up a gift card. I saw graffiti on outside being scrubbed by the same kid who served us our food. They had five employees I could see but only one kid actually working.  We ordered three things- blizzard, sundae, cheeseburger: after 15 min we got cheeseburger and blizzard. The same kid said \"what else did you order?\" even though our receipt was right on table with the number they never called. They finally brought out hot fudge sundae but it was cold by then.  We still love dairy queen's food but...  ATTN owner: please train these poor kids working here how to run a tight ship - they looked lost! Oh yeah, & have someone else clean the graffiti- not the same guy serving my food!"}
{"text":"Went to drive thru at this sun city location and the gal working the drive thru was rude and acted like we were bothering her. She basically thru our ice cream at us. We asked for napkins for which she replied \"yep\" then slammed the window. Wow. This was Friday evening October 7, 2016 at approx 7 pm."}
{"text":"Shit. Cold hot fudge. Burger was so hot it was as if it was in a microwave for over 5 min. Everyone should just stop coming here let it close down."}
{"text":"I had placed an order for a 10\" round ice cream cake last weekend for a birthday party this weekend. I had scheduled pickup for Noon since I had a lot of other errands to run before the party at 5. I went to pick up the cake and the guy at the counter asked for my name and what was written on the cake. He went to the back and was there for several minutes - I assumed they were doing the writing then. After about 5 minutes, the manager can out with a printout of my order and said \"I wish I had better news for you, but it's not here. We don't have the cake.\" She explained they were having \"internet issues\" all week and this was the first time she was seeing the order.  I was a little disappointed, and ready to just grab a pre-made cake from their freezer, when she said \"I'm about halfway done making a cake right now. I can make it to these specifications. What's the absolute latest you need it by?\" I told her by 4:30 and she said she would finish it up and get it in the flash freezer for me, and it would be ready by then. I agreed, and went about the rest of my errands.  At 4:30 I went to pick it up. It was exactly as I had wanted it! The manager couldn't apologize enough and said \"this one's on us. Tell everyone we wish them a very happy birthday.\" I was stunned. People make mistakes, and they had the cake ready in time for the party. But I graciously accepted and thanked them for their kind gesture.  And by golly it was he best darn ice cream cake I've had in my life! All of the party guests agreed!  Despite the slip-up, I will for sure continue giving them my business and buying all of my ice cream cakes from here going forward, based on their wonderful service and the quality of the cake. I might just call in my order though next time ;-)  Thank you DQ for making my birthday extra special!"}
{"text":"Rudest employee ever! Also doesn't have anything on there menu or the stuff is to lazy to make what's on the menu! The guy at the drive thru said they don't sell waffle bowls but it's on the menu and on the ad screen! We had to repeat out order and wait for responses from the guy in the drive Thur 3 times! Management should have employees work on customer service still or get people who actually want to work there! Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the good  1. Cheap 5buck lunch meal 2. Clean dining area  Now to the bad  1. Rude counter employees 2. women cooking food with long hair and no hair nets 3. Dirty Bathrooms that had urine smell and stains on toilets 4. Under staffed at lunch time, makes for long wait for service"}
{"text":"At any Dairy Queen any product you order is going to be near identical. The true challenge lies in consistency of product, speed, and customer service. Out of those three options that are important to me, we have strikes one and two.  This location is always on the ball and has not messed up an order of mine to this date. However, the customer service needs a little work. During after-hours, the drive-thru can really line up. This is understandable if the place is busy but the drive-thru pace is reminiscent of the terrible traffic on the Long Island Expressway I came to Vegas to escape. The intercom system in which you place your order is highly ineffectual, many times leaving the employee annoyed enough for you to hear it in the inflection in their voice. Kind of reminds me of the 'And then...' scene from \"Dude, Where's my Car?\""}
{"text":"Very excited about the Dairy Queen opening in Carolina mall! They have Orange Julius, blizzard treats and birthday cakes!"}
{"text":"Grabbing a quick bit to eat. Delicious all need dogs and a clean eating area. Looks good to me"}
{"text":"A bit sketchy but food was good.   The lady who helped us hit on my husband. I don't think she thought we were together. Perfect. She also gave me a crooked dipped cone... Hmmm"}
{"text":"Blizzards make me happy. The signature ice cream dessert, not the winter storm.   Like all other DQs, this location provides them, so by that fact alone, they make me happy.  However, I don't need a sour-faced 17 year old shoving it at me from the drive-thru window.  Not cool, kid, not cool.  I will take it that said 17 year old was having a bad day, so it's forgiven.    I'll still be back for a Blizzard (or several)."}
{"text":"People here are so mean especially the workers, when me and my boyfriend came here they were making fun of us cos we' re gay. I would never ever come back here anymore."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy reviewing fast food and frankly don't see the point. That being said this is a rare circumstance. This Dairy Queen was so filthy and nasty I couldn't hardly stand to be in there. The floors are dirty the tables covered in ketchup and crumbs. If all that wasn't enough when leaving I had to use the bathroom and the toilet was filled with human waste if you get my vibe. This is an absolutely filthy place and if that bothers you as it does me DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff  Even with the line out the door  It's a must try I like the banana split"}
{"text":"Well, somebody got the message and they brought back the coconut so I can have my Blizzard the way I like it."}
{"text":"This review is about this DQ's service and product:  Product: My husband and I ordered a hot fudge sundae and a dipped cone from the DQ drive thru. His hot fudge sundae came exactly the way it was supposed, however, when the drive thru rep handed us my order, she gave me a plain vanilla cone. I had advised that it was supposed to be dipped. After about a minute or so, she handed me my dipped cone. Now, I have been to this Dairy Queen several times and what was handed me was a vanilla cone with a very very very thin layer of chocolate around the ice cream (please see picture). I have ordered this item in the past and never has the chocolate looked like that. Yes, I'm complaining about the amount of chocolate that was used on my cone, but specifically the quality and presentation is what I really had a problem with.   Service: I went into the DQ and politely asked to speak with someone. When the manager approached me I advised that I was a bit dissatisfied with the end result. He stated, \"The chocolate is too hot and that's why it looks like that on the ice cream\". There was no apology, and in fact, I'm a bit sad at the way he made me feel as if I was bothering him. I asked just for a new plain vanilla cone instead. As he walked away to make it, he looked over his shoulder and said, \"You can throw that one away\". I did. He came back and handed me a plain cone and said nothing. At this point, I was so surprised with the lack of customer service that I took the cone and walked out. There was no sincerity or apology. Not that I was looking for that, but I do expect to be treated at least somewhat nicely as I was not irate or even mad about the situation until the manager told me to throw my original order away. In addition, there was no refund for the difference. I know we're talking about small change here, but being the manager he should have at least refunded me for the difference.   I understand they were busy, but I can't understand being treated like a bother. Although this place is just a few blocks away from me, I would rather go out of my way for ice cream than ever go here again."}
{"text":"Service is NO good here. The kids that work here were arguing as we waited in the drive for our sundae's. As the girl handed us each desert, she didn't even make eye contact. Gave us two different totals AND messed up the order. My chocolate dip had a napkin stuck onto the dried chocolate... I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Meh. Super slow service and seriously inconsistent product prep are serious issues here. Drinks sometimes come out odd tasting and they often seem to be out of stuff. Plus something outside the business desperately needs to clear their grease trap as it reeks outside the business."}
{"text":"I love DQ but was disappointed about the fact that they didn't have a scanner for their DQ app. I had a few free things coming to me from the app and intended on using them but they wouldn't let me due it. Love DQ but if you plan on using your app, find another one to go to!"}
{"text":"Clean Dairy Queen and friendly enough cashiers but my cookie dough blizzard didn't have cookie dough, so the worker in the back came to fix it. He didn't seem very happy to remake my order. The worker took the wrongly made blizzard and threw it away. I understand discarding the item if it was incorrect, but I think it is nicer to let the customer keep it considering it was a perfectly good blizzard that I could have given to another person in my party. When he came back, he didn't flip the blizzard upside down (if they do not, call them out and your blizzard is free)! Considering he already looked pretty pissed off that he had to redo my order, I didn't say anything... However, the cashier was sweet/apologetic even though I don't think she knew what was going on. Mediocre experience, not worth anything more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I can't even count how many times I've had dinner with a friend at Dish, Zada Jane's, Creation, etc., and we've decided to walk down the street to DQ and get Blizzard afterward. DQ's Blizzards and other ice cream treats are the best on a hot summer night, but you see plenty of people waiting to order even in the winter.   It's a pretty popular spot, so expect to wait a while. And unfortunately, they only take cash. I highly recommend the Blizzard with Butterfinger or Oreos."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like DQ? And they gave this one a face lift!  Not a lot to say here but I've never had bad service here and the drive thru seems to be always busy so, dozens of ashamed late-night eaters can't be wrong."}
{"text":"Here's the down low - if you are craving a late evening (why do they close so early?) DQ fix, it'll be quicker to drive to this location and order than to wait in line at the Central and Camelback location. This service isn't the fastest in the world, but it's quick enough and, coupled with the shorter queue, you'll be on your way quicker than if you'd not made the gutsy call to travel into the Avenues for some ice cream treats.  The other benefit, they give you more Blizzard mix ins here. Don't ask me why, don't ask me how - but it's true."}
{"text":"I forgot why we stopped going here but just remembered. This owner of the establishment  is cheap. He trains the employees to make these pathetic sized dipped cones. All my life we have went to DQ for special treats.  Love the dipped cones they are always made as wide as the cone. This place fills the cones and there is 1/4 inch space between the edge of the cone and the  ice cream all the way around. They are so skinny that they start falling over when you eat it. I've questioned different times always a different answer. This night I was told it's like that to catch anything that melts. That is just sad. If I'm paying $3+ For soft serve ice cream that costs you pennies on the dollar make it like all the other DQ'S do. Won't go back again. It's stupid."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious ice cream and quick service.  Plus, this new location is super cute and clean."}
{"text":"As others have noted, this place always seems to have just one employee overwhelmed by the job. I've never seen a line of more than three people, even those waiting for food.   This makes the wait for your order fairly unbearable, as you have an unobstructed view of the agonizing slowness. Ice cream is good, but doesn't quite taste like other Dairy Queens."}
{"text":"My favorite Dairy Queen! Manager took our order and made us the best treat ever!  My husband really like the mini Rollo's"}
{"text":"DQ is a great place to go for family celebrations.  We like the outside seating but tonite there were 3 ladies smoking like crazy. Otherwise, had a great time with great treats."}
{"text":"Ahh Dairy Queen. Their soft serve takes me back to my childhood. I grew up with one just across the street from my house. It's a good thing this one isn't too close to me, otherwise I would be there every night! There is something to please everyone and it is always good. DQ may not the best soft serve/shake/cold treat ever but it is consistent and satisfying. My favorites... Blizzards (try the French Silk Pie), Peanut Buster Parfait, Strawberry Sundae, Mister Misty Float, or a good old chocolate dipped cone.   This location has a walk-up window only. No indoor seating, or any seating at all! Order at the window and enjoy the evening air. Service has always been phenomenal at this location. Only complaint... The parking lot gets kinda hairy on warm summer evenings when everyone is looking for a ice cream fix."}
{"text":"I love this particular DQ.  Staff is courteous, friendly and efficient.  I have have been a customer for years and have never had a bad experience.  This location is so busy the frozen inventory turns over quickly and often.  Establishment was recently updated and is very clean.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen in Goodyear.....Yahoo! Always been a fan and glad to have one closer to home. Now, like many fast food chains, the service is generally not so great but today's was very good. Now it was opening night and it appeared that all staff were a go for the big night, so the question on good service will show its face in time.   For my cold dessert, I went with the classic banana split blizzard. Often with this treat, DQ fails to put in enough components but today it was filled with just the right amount. As many blizzard fans also know, there is at times and issue with blending it all together well. Tonight, that was slightly the case with the bottom half being mostly just vanilla ice cream and no mixings.    Overall, glad to have DQ in the far west valley and looking forward to many visits with the family. I anticipate the service to drop a little given all my previous DQ experiences and probably will stick with giving them three stars but tonight they had everything working."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a sucker for their $5 lunch deals.  I always order the chicken strips with gravy and a hot fudge sundae."}
{"text":"Ok for a blizzard but horrid food; and keep in mind this is fast food. Well it's supposed to be fast.  Ordered lunch and a blizzard.  Got the drink and blizzard but told to pull out front and wait for the food.  After 10 mins I get my small bag of lunch.  At this point the pepsi is watered down and the blizzard is melted.  Get home and open the bag - no napkins, not ketchup.  The chicken sandwich has close to a 1/4 cup of mayo, one small tomato slice and a silver dollar size piece of wilted lettuce.  After scraping off the mayo, putting on my own lettuce I was finally ready to eat.  Been here before and was reminded again today why I need to not go again.  Disgusting food.  Horrid service."}
{"text":"There's DQ lovers and haters out there; I'm  a lover. My go to is their soft serve and hubby's is the chocolate dip. Their soft serve is thick and creamy, not whipped and full of air. They also make sure to fill the inside of the cone so you're not stuck with an empty cone when you get to the bottom. I've had their delicious ice cream cakes at many parties. Their ice cream cakes are actually THE ONLY ones I've seen at my friends' parties: that speaks to their popularity.  Today I was in the mood for a drink. I was thinking of getting their strawberry shake since they use real fruit. Had a lovely convo with the staff (she's the one who also decorates the cakes) who told me about her favorite drink, an off menu item called the DQ freeze. It combines ice cream with their Arctic Rush drink (slushy). I'm always up to trying something new; give me one using the cherry slushy please.  The staff was worried that I wouldn't like it and offered to make me a shake if I didn't. It tasted like a cherry creamsicle: took me a minute to decide if I liked it, but it grew on me.   DQ is my go to for soft serve when I want something  better than cheapy McDonald's ice cream."}
{"text":"Love the blizzards Marcos in the drive thru is so friendly and always pleasant when we visit! The one in sun city is awful and staff are rude will only come to this one!"}
{"text":"The same delicious treat you'll remember since you were a kid and as consistent at this location as any other. No line on this visit but it's not uncommon for lines to go out the door.  Not the cheapest treat out there as soft serve from McDonald's and Costco are a much better value. But heck, it's Dairy Queen!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty poor. The employees were pretty confused and very slow.   I ordered a small Strawberry Shake ($3.79) and the lady asked if I wanted whipped cream and a cherry. I said yes, but she didn't add the cherry. Where my cherry go? )':  My friends' ordered 1 Skor and 1 S'mores & Oreo Blizzard ($4.59 for small), but they accidentally made two Skor Blizzards. Instead of making a fuss about it, my friend just took it.   Lastly, friend also ordered a Buffalo Chicken Melt ($2.89) and the chicken was stale and impossible to chew. Think tender; now think of the opposite of tender. That's how the chicken was like.  Overall, I give the experience a 2/5"}
{"text":"We ordered chicken strips, a snack melt, and a shake...they kept reading the wrong order back at least 5 times. They were being nice and trying to give us a better combo so we could save money (which is why this is getting two stars and not one). So after waiting at the window for 15 minutes the food finally comes out. Spent a total of 20 min not knowing what was going on and no explanation. I hope the service emproves because i do like DQ..."}
{"text":"There is no rushing the staff that works at this Dairy Queen. They are in slow motion all the time.  I went in to get the $7 bacon cheeseburger deal today and was told they can't make the burger. \"It's too hard to cook\" was the answer the girl on the grill said.  When I questioned this because the guy in front of me had a burger, I was told \"too hard to cook. We can't make the burger\" and they tried to upsell me on something else instead.  I ended up going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and I love it! The last time, I built a complicated sundae and they made it perfectly! Total heaven. It's definitely not a place you can leave your car and walk around (park elsewhere for that - the parking lot is tiny and busy so don't be rude to other customers!), but I have no complaints and will keep coming back forever and ever."}
{"text":"Went in last night for a blizzard, 2 regular banana splits and a chicken basket. When I received the order it was instead 3 blizzards and a chicken basket. Not a huge deal just fix it and move on right? But instead of just fixing the order, they \"voided\" the order so now I have to wait 7-10 days for my money to be put back in the account and recharged me $1.15 more than initially. As a business of you mess up either eat that $1.15 or just charge me the $1.15, not the full price again. That's just bad customer service. When I called Bill the owner for an explanation today he got very defensive and says that he doesn't control the 1000's of financial institutions. Understood sir, but you do control your business and your policies. If the company makes a mistake 99.9% of the time they do not go back and ask the customer for 210% of the money for the order, which is exactly what you said company policy was. And while you are making the banana splits, why not remake the melted blizzard too? It's 100 degrees out when I have to wait an extra 15 minutes it's pretty much inedible."}
{"text":"This location does not honor the Dairy Queen App. We asked for manager another stepped up and said we had to print the offer. Yet the offer itself it would be voided if printed, the manager said their store wasn't a part of the app/coupon yet they came on store locator."}
{"text":"I usually stop in for an ice cream cone on a hot day.  It always tastes great and the portion is pretty large for the price.  It looks like they have pretty good prices on meals although I've never tried them.  Plenty of parking is available in this strip plaza although there's no drive-thru."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would! Seriously the WORST place to get soft serve/ blizzards. The customer service is horrible and the soft serve they use on the blizzard is so watery that it looks like a shake instead of a blizzard. The drive-thru line during the weekend is outrages. Do NOT go to this location."}
{"text":"Great place- no complaints. 1/2 price drinks during a daytime happy hour. This DQ supports the events and needs of the community- offering fundraisers and sponsoring productions and teams. Nice staff, good quick Hot food too!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in the last few months.  Your newer younger employees don't have a clue.  The service is bad and they take forever for simple orders.  The fancy soda machine is never working, and they look at me like an idiot when I tell them.  And there was a hair in my chicken strip basket! ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!  I won't be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Food is great but quite over priced. Staff isn't as friendly but not too bad either. I'm saying 3 stars."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday night (before 8pm). Enough staff members but inexperienced with a few trainees? The venue had a long line up and was quite warm inside. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed and disorganized. The kitchen area looked really dim. Working condition doesn't seem that great for the employees...  Ordered the summer berry cheesecake blizzard. It had a few humongous frozen blackberries in it which I enjoyed, but nothing too special overall.  As it has been a hot day, the outdoor seats were mostly taken. I assume when summer hits, this place will be madness."}
{"text":"Came here today because the weather was perfect. The line was long but the service was fast! The line went through so quickly! I'm glad i came here bc my sundae was perfect."}
{"text":"There were four employees when I walked in there were zero customers. Not one of the employees smiled or said hello. The man that took my order actually look like he was physically in pain being at work, or had an extreme hatred for people. I ordered one of the iron grill sandwiches and three blizzards to go, they were all put in the same bag so my ice cream is sitting on top of my hot sandwich. Really? I've never worked at a fast food place but I'm assuming that hot and cold items going separate bags! The customer service is horrible but the food is good so you just have to suck it up and keep going."}
{"text":"Yeah, I love Blizzards. Unfortunately the price keeps going up and up and the newer mini size is a total rip off. Gotta say I've never tried their food, and I have no real desire to."}
{"text":"Worst customer service not friendly the people who where working looked like they didn't even wanna be there no one smiles at least pretend to be happy will not go to this location again"}
{"text":"I grew up going to this DQ.  Still love all the flavors it has to offer.  However, they gone a little crazy with the 8, 150 Watt Energy-Efficient lightbulbs in the 10 square feet leading up to the cash registers.  I nearly had a seizure.  I LITERALLY put my hand above my eyes, making a mock visor, to shield my light-sensitive eyes from the intense glare!  The \"cherry on top\" if you will, was the adolescent employee who was all too moody about defending el sol when asked, \"what's goin' on with the lights here\"?  Seriously....how could she NOT NOTICE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THOSE LIGHTS?!?!?!?!  The cookie dough blizzard was excellent as always!  Minus the glare, it would have been a 5 star event  OH, one more thing.  No joking, we actually whipped out a camera and took a picture of us under the lights as it was all too funny to us!"}
{"text":"We ordered a custom DQ Blizzard cake and it was made to perfection and the best we ever had.  Also, the staff were all smiling - kind and courteous!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is great! We took my mom for a surprise ice cream treat on a cold march afternoon. Even being an off season the was plenty of customers and staff alike.  The counter is huge with plenty of space to linger, as well as a public washroom.  There is tons and tons of outside seating available for when it's actually warm enough to go outside.  However no seating inside save for 2 tables.  The pricing is your typical ice cream pricing, I always get a blizzard and find it very quirky that they serve your ice cream to you upside down.  I had wanted to use my bogo coupon but the server gave me the discount without me even having to show it to her!   Great service, great treats.   5/5"}
{"text":"Stale cone, asked for chocolate sprinkles, and got rainbow."}
{"text":"This location just opened earlier this week at the corner of Rainbow and Robindale. I know 4 stars might be a little excessive for a fast food joint, but considering I've got a huge sweet tooth (that's why I was a fat kid) I'm giving them high marks for their sweet stuff. I love me some Blizzards, especially the strawberry cheesequake. This place is a grill and chill, so they've got all the fried and greasy food you would expect from a fast food restaurant. They also have a small patio area if you want to gaze out into the picturesque view of the Rainbow/Robindale intersection (yeah, that was my poor attempt at sarcasm).  The staff is obviously still in the process of training. When I ordered my blizzard the girl had no idea how to ring it up. But everyone was very nice and friendly. After you order they'll bring the food out to your table.  TIP: If you sign up for the fan club on the DQ web site they'll send you a coupon for a free 16 oz blizzard w/ the purchase of another 16 oz blizzard."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend because I was craving for a good old oreo blizzard and man do I feel bad dragging my friend to this place. I had no idea that it was possible to fail in making something so simple: vanilla ice cream + oreos. When I got my blizzard it was already melting and mushy. The employee didn't even bother turning the cup upside-down like they normally do at other locations. I can't believe I spent $5 for something I didn't even bother eating. At first I thought it was only the top layer of ice cream, but it was the whole so called \"blizzard.\" Definitely not coming here again and I can see why this place has such low reviews. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but when I do write them it is completely deserved. I'll just stick to Yogurtland for now!"}
{"text":"Gawd! They NEVER have chocolate soft serve! Seriously DQ? You have ONE JOB! It's to have ice cream and when you have no chocolate, you fail.   11/10/16- no chocolate AGAIN! This is the 3rd visit in like 45ish days and there is never chocolate"}
{"text":"This location does not even deserve the one star I am giving them. I was so excited to come to Dairy Queen after 9 months of fighting pregnancy cravings my family gave into me asking. Boy was this a poor decision. There was 5 of us....3 ordered Blizzards, 1 Peanut Buster Parfait and 1 Large Vanilla cone...all simple orders. Right after we ordered I noticed the girl (ended up being the manager) replacing the ice cream in the front machine because it had ran out. Instead of letting the ice cream set up for a second she immediately starts making our ice cream. First thing she makes is my fathers large cone. Came out as one lump instead of the 2 large lumps and swirl a top. I asked my dad if the ice cream was too soft because it looked horrible and he said yeah but it was still good. Next was my mothers Peanut Buster Parfait which was completely melted. She was unhappy and I told her to complain. She insisted not to. My husbands and brothers Blizzards come out and they just start devouring their melted messes not caring. It wasn't until my Blizzard came out that enough was enough. I could literally drink it as a shake! So I go up front and show them that and they remake it no problem. I believe her name was Marie who remade it. Well as I am grabbing the new one my mother decides to complain about the service. Marie walks off as my mother is talking to her. I had walked away at this point but came back when I noticed the girl who originally took our order (the manager) talking to my mom. My mom shows her Peanut Buster Parfait and the girl insists it was correct. That is when I finally say I managed a DQ for 2 years in Vegas and this is absolutely not correct. Right after I say this she says I am attacking her? I am 9 months pregnant and cannot have my blood pressure rising so at this point I decide to throw my \"shake\" away and leave. I am absolutely horrified by the service of this location and plan on calling corporate on Monday. I have worked in customer service my whole life and honestly if they didn't have two different lies about why the ice cream was runny I would have been willing to just take a refund and just accept it was a bad night for them and their machines. Instead I know alot about the back end of how DQ works and am now going to make 100% sure corporate understands how the owner is letting their manager treat customers! Please support another franchise owner who actually trains their employees on how to handle customers!"}
{"text":"So glad to have something close to our house. We have gone here a few times and has been good! We have ordered the club sandwiches and blizzards. Everything has been good!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Seems to be busier than most DQ's, maybe because it's so new. The only problem I have with it is the last two times I've ordered a strawberry sundae, there were little bits of chocolate on the bottom. They must use the same machine to make everything in."}
{"text":"I come for the for the five buck chicken strip lunch about twice a week.  The service is friendly, wait time is reasonable & my food order hasn't been screwed up - ever.  I live closer to the cave creek and sweetwater location but drive further to go to this location."}
{"text":"If you go after 7pm, you can bet that your order won't be right, or will be done half-a$$ed. On multiple occasions blizzards are half mixed, missing ingredient, or shorted the portion size.   Its in a nice location, food and ice cream are good, service is the downfall."}
{"text":"WARNING: Only go here for blizzards.  I am almost always in the mood for a blizzard and so since this is the closest DQ in our area we go hear about once a month. Last week we decided to actually get food from there because we were just that starving. I'm not sure how it is possible to mess up soda, but somehow they were able to do that. At first we thought our drinks were merely flat, out of carbonation. But then after they gave us new drinks I realized either one they may have done nothing and just spit in our drinks and give them back or two somehow this place manages to even serve subpar soda. My husband ordered the mushroom swiss and he had exactly 2 mushroom pieces on his Burger , WTF.... Even though I was on my period, I couldn't even finish my food lol it was just that gross. Never again. Blizzards only"}
{"text":"I want to like this DQ because it's close by, looks to be locally owned, and I love Blizzards...but they never seem to get the order correct. How hard can it be? Well very hard I would have to say- obviously.  We go in every now and then and order two small Blizzards...one: oreo -the other: snickers blizzard with chocolate syrup.  Not once have I ever gotten the chocolate syrup in it. Not one single time. So this time before I ordered I made sure to watch...and sure enough...no syrup added. I don't want to be rude and say \"can you actually put the syrup in this time\"--I just want them  to do it!  So this time I said okay if they don't do it we're not coming back...and so this will be the last time I go here. I didn't complain when they handed it to me, there was a line of people, and only 2 workers, so I didn't want to be \"that person\"...so fine...I'll take the blizzard and go. But not come back."}
{"text":"I love DQ creations and their ice cream. This place however, does not do DQ justice. Every time I come here, it is ALWAYS dirty behind the cashier. It is easy to see all the crumbs, spilled ice cream, and trash on the floor through the drive-thru window. It's even easier to see it when inside the building. It's really disgusting to see. I usually order the cone, and it is served very sloppily 97% of the time. DQ is known for the swirl at the top. It's a talking point on their history board in the restaurant! Sometimes I don't even get a swirl on my cone! There is one employee there who holds his peers accountable and makes them re-do the cone if it is poorly made, but I'm not sure he works there anymore. More recently, I switched it up and ordered a blizzard. About 5 minutes down the road, I noticed ice cream dripping and saw a huge tear in the cup. I was too tired to go back so I dealt with it. The employees themselves are very nice, but it's their lack of meticulousness that really annoys me. The only reason I come here is because it's conveniently located. If I have time and energy, I prefer driving a few extra miles to another DQ that has better service!"}
{"text":"I like they tell you the calories if items so I switched from chocolate soft serve to a smoothie fruits drink. I feel satisfied and better Obo it myself for the smart choice and it served it purpose to cool me off."}
{"text":"Hadn't had Dairy Queen in ages! Kind of a novelty for when one has been on good behavior I'd say. Anyhow, I pulled up to the (yup!) drive-through and ordered the Banana Cream Pie Blizzard. (Unless for some very odd reason you don't like bananas, cream, or pies,...or banana cream pies - GET THIS!) After my first bite, I was in complete silence with the radio turned off for the rest of my drive home while taking in and savoring every moment of it. True story."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today with baby and wife. We got the guardians of the galaxy ice cream and it was very good! very expensive but goooood. It was basically empty. Every table was dirty and at least 3-4 staff members watched me take out baby wipes to clean the table and chairs. Also very disappointing that there were no changing tables in the washrooms and the washrooms were very dirty. This is unacceptable in this day and age. From the looks of the reviews management does not care."}
{"text":"Decent fast service. I dont care if it smells like a deep fryer. Theres a great DQ thats been renovated over on warm springs if you dont like this one. However, we go to dq for cheap quick ice cream, no more, no less, & thats what we got."}
{"text":"The remodel in here is nice. Theres an area for kids to sit & play and the space is better utilized. Its also updated.   The service is a lot better since the remodel as well. They now deliver your order to your table for you, and with staff turnover theyve got much more customer service oriented staff now.   Updated to four stars."}
{"text":"Oh, what an amazing experience I had at this particular Dairy Queen! You see, I actually own my own Dairy Queen location in El Paso, Texas, so whenever I visit another location, I am always expecting a high standard of quality for every single product. Well this location blew my expectations out of the water. We ordered three things; two blizzards and a caramel sundae. The blizzards were super yummy, as to expect with any blizzard. But the sundae is what really caught my eye. You see, the curl on the top of the sundae is picture perfect, a feat that is not so easily accomplished in this industry. Whoever's such attention to detail should be commended. I will definitely be seeing to my return at this location!"}
{"text":"A Brampton staple. A few face changes over the decades. In 2017 I appreciated the extra staff on-hand, less waiting.  Counter staff friendly."}
{"text":"Love and Hate Dairy Queen..  Blizzards, cones, are great tasting.  Although Dairy Cream is superior (Cawthra/Lake Shore), plus much better price.  Hate how I feel afterwards, especially one of those blizzards w oreo, reeses, etc...  My gummmach...!  Biggest negative; over priced.  Paying around 5 bucks for a dipped cone, ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I usually check yelp reviews before hand but never bothered with DQ thinking you just can't go wrong. Long story short, my blizzard was missing chocolate and halfway melted and I didn't realize till I got home. Needless to say, the trash ate it not me. Pretty pissed off actually, taking the time to drive with my husband and toddler, waiting 20 minutes in line to come back home to some crappy blizzard. Wont be going back again. Wasting my time even writing this review, I mean look at other reviews, this place & staff needs some serious help but owner obviously does not care. Sad."}
{"text":"Terrible location. Franchise owner is not required to carry chocolate ice cream so they don't but yet employees tell customers \"we are out of it right now\" funny they have been out of it for over 6 months. Hot food is sub par, thank goodness for them (vanilla) ice cream is a year around out here. Other wise I doubt they would be still open. My recommendation is to drive a little further so you get the choices that you want and expect from DQ."}
{"text":"DQ... yes, it's a chain. DQ... yes, it's pretty much a household name and has been for years. DQ... yes, it brings back warm and fuzzy childhood memories for many. DQ... has filled many a sweet craving during my two pregnancies. DQ... from multi-ingredient blizzards to simple vanilla ice-cream cones, you really can't find a bad item on their (dessert) menu. DQ... it's an oldie but goodie!  On a recent visit with girlfriends, I did see that DQ now offers all kinds of food items as well.  Maybe they've done this for years, but I haven't really ever paid attention as I've gone in for my ice cream cone, blizzard, or slushie, and left.  On this particular visit, I stood in a longer line and actually looked at the menu.  I'm not so sure I'd trust this location or any other DQ for chicken fingers, hot dog, hamburger, salad, etc...   That being said, go here for dessert.  The service is fine, but not super friendly.  There is a decent amount of seating available, which is more than can be said for their Old Town Scottsdale location, and most importantly, the ice cream will not disappoint.    I recommend the rainbow sprinkles to add some color (and a tad bit more sugar) to your treat!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude employees who clearly don't care to be there. The new remodel is extremely dull. The pecan mudslides were in a shallow, skinny cup and looked like they came from the garbage can. I worked at a DQ for 6 years, making this experience especially disappointing. I was always told, as a worker, that working at an ice cream shop is important because you want to enlighten the customers' days with a nice smile/attitude and some pretty ice cream. I didn't get that vibe on the other side of the counter. So sad with the direction of this company, especially given it's awesome opportunity in such a beautiful city like Willoughby. Wouldn't recommend, unless you've got some strooong cravings... just expect to leave with a pit in your stomach!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen brings back tons of memories for me, leading back to my  high school days.  Back then, my friends and I would go on our lunch break or spare period to grab a refreshing snack during the first month of school while it was still hot outside or to celebrate the end of the academic year with a cold treat when the summer weather would approach.  This location is right smack on Yonge Street near the Empress Walk and Sheppard Grande movie theatres. This is great because if you rather go for ice cream than a coffee, you can stop into this Dairy Queen before or after a flick.  I have a few weaknesses at DQ - their chocolate dipped cones and their blizzards.  Some of the key flavours I LOVE for my blizzard are the chocolate chip cookie dough, strawberry cheesequake, reeses pieces and banana cream pie.  All of their ice cream products are really cheap, which makes it a simple and delicious spot to stop off and cool off.  Also, if you live in the area or not, you can eat your ice cream and take a nice walk around the Yonge Street area or walk in the residential neighbourhoods that outline this area."}
{"text":"I have no idea who was working tonight but this guy had no idea about any of their products. I couldn't remember what an Arctic Blast was called at the moment so I described what it was to him and he told me he did not have the blue raspberry so I asked what other flavors there were. He listed a bunch so I replied \"strawberry\" and then he pauses and says \"we don't have strawberry ice cream we have to flavor it what you're asking for is a blizzard\" and I just stared at the box at the drive through like ?????? This man literally listed the flavors to me and then tells me he doesn't have it????? Never going back there again. Definitely won't forget what an Arctic blast is anymore to avoid dealing with a half brain like him again. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"The blizzards and sundaes are not well made. Not many toppings or candy in them.   The staff are not very appropriately dressed, wearing yoga shorts that are skin tight and to short. Along with that, they are impatient, unwilling to answer questions and rude.   Along with all of that, they are very over priced. $7.01 for a large blizzard that is mostly ice cream."}
{"text":"One of the better fast food burger options.  They're not dry and bland like most of the major chains, and they have a lot of interesting options.  I'm partial to the Flamethrower burger which is lightly spicy and covered with a tasty creamy sauce.  Service at this location is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience. The atmosphere was lively and exciting.  The music was totally dance-worthy.  I came in for lunch with my 2 girls and we were all dancing in our seats the whole time.  The staff was excellent with table delivery and attentive to dining room cleanliness. Jovonne took our order and brought out our food he was so courteous and made sure we had everything we needed. The food was hot and fresh.  Could even see the staff having a great time enjoying the music.   Coming from a customer service back ground, it is proven that when the staff is having a good time and enjoying themselves, it makes an even better experience for the guests.   Keep up the good work.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I come here all the time cause it's close to my house and on the way to where I need to go the drive thru people are extremely rude and seem to always want us out of the drive thru with the attitude. We order food and they give us little portions half blended blizzard and then it's all watery and they never flip the blizzards because they know its watery such a horrible place lol I can't explain anymore."}
{"text":"Customer service is non-existent here.  They are more concerned about laughing and joking with each other and they are serving the customers.  I ordered a large twist cone the other day and when she gave it to me it was definitely no more than a medium. When she handed it to me I looked up and asked - are you sure this is a large? She didn't even bother looking at what she handed me she just said yes and walked away."}
{"text":"would give it zero stars but that's not possible. first of all they did not inform us of cash only service at the drive through after ordering (no sign up).she took forever to figure out our change, so two ice creams were melted and she didn't give us napkins. she ASLO didn't flip our blizzards because she knew that they were partly melted. when we got our ice cream we realized it was vanilla with chocolate syrup (also didn't tell us they didn't have chocolate ice cream). TERRIBLE! i was looking forward to a fun trip to DQ. will never go there again"}
{"text":"I like the fact they are open late. I think the hours are incorrect on the page as they are open until 10:45p most nights. It is a smaller location, true. The only food on the menu is hot dogs, oddly enough."}
{"text":"The Mocha Moolatte is just about the best thing I've ever tasted and on Mondays they are only $1.99 compared to like $4.50 the rest of the week.     I might have to agree with the other reviewer about the quantity.  My friend ordered a chicken strip basket and it came out to about 8 dollars and it looked like a kid size portion.  The chicken strips were TINY.  My friend said she didn't want it and the manager was pretty rude about it.   The rest of the staff is really nice though.  :)"}
{"text":"New & improved! Clean, good service, hilarious staff! Food was fresh & done to perfection"}
{"text":"Decent service (super young & standoffish attitude teenagers). Not as clean as most but gets through customers quickly so the wait isn't too long. Nice small patio outside, gated in so super safe!"}
{"text":"Just come here for the ice cream not sure about the other menu items. Drive through is quick and friendly. They go above and beyond in customer service. My pregnant wife is in a soft serve fad right now. You don't mess with a pregnant woman, and they don't. She gets what she needs and it doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"My blizzard was a milkshake. Had to go inside and ask for them to remake it and they did it but acted as if they didn't want to."}
{"text":"I always go to this particular location because they always take pride in creating a nice dessert. The place is always clean and employees are friendly. I have never had bad service ever. Will keep coming back and thank you for being a great place to get late night dessert"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for ice cream. I am a fan of the blizzard, they really hit the spot on those hot Nevada days but they also have cherry dip. more than any other topping on my ice cream cones I love cherry dip and they are the only place I know that has it.  I still haven't mad it inside but the service through the drive thru is fast and friendly. It's summertime and I will be here when I feel the need to cool down with some ice cream."}
{"text":"Nothing stellar to make this place stand out and get an above average grade. They make what you order and get it to you. Lots to choose from on the menu. I usually hit up this location when I want a Blizzard or want to treat the fam to dessert."}
{"text":"Nothing stellar to make this place stand out and get an above average grade. They make what you order and get it to you. Lots to choose from on the menu. I usually hit up this location when I want a Blizzard or want to treat the fam to dessert and I'm near my house."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(208/365)  \"Old School Ice Cream\"  We were in the mood for some old school soft serve and the Yelp App brought us here. It's also an Orange Julius too, and I loved Strawberry Julius growing up, so I got a simple Hot Fudge Sundae, and I just had to get a small Strawberry Julius to see if it tasted the same.  The sundae was okay, but the Strawberry Julius was a tad too sweet for my liking.  Glad I got the smallest size! The workers were friendly and courteous and the location was pretty convenient,  but for me, not enough to see me coming back any time soon.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: \uuu/  \uuu/  \u  2.5"}
{"text":"This review is written in behalf of my boyfriend. This review is for the service, not the food.  It's Summer in Vegas and it is easily at least 90-something degrees out here in the evening. He calls Dairy Queen to ask what time they closed today (Monday) and they say 9:30pm. He was IN the store talking to a staff member at 9:28pm. And the girl in the front says they turned off all their machines (he wanted a Blizzard) following the comment with \"and my watch is fast\". HUH? If your watch says it's 9:30pm, then the doors should've been locked because the store is officially closed. From my personal experience, that is how businesses operate. Don't leave the store open and turn off your machines in an attempt to close and go home faster.   So for this Dairy Queen, make sure you get here even earlier than their already  \"reDQlous\" closing time if you want any machine-produced frozen goodies."}
{"text":"Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much. You would do much better by going to mcdonalds. This isn't the first time. I should quit giving this place chances. I'm disappointed every time. I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged $2.60 more. The staff is rarely friendly. They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen, a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods. The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile, and not like you hate your job and just want to go home?"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and very friendly and hard-working staff. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because they barely have any Dairy Queen food options available."}
{"text":"Mariah was a great help with our order. Very pleasant, smiled the entire time. Great desserts too !"}
{"text":"This place was pretty tasty.  Not the best presentation of food, but it wasn't bad by any means.  I love DQ and I grew up on the ice cream.  Pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"The employees were very nice and polite and looked clean.  They were friendly and got our blizzard quickly so we could eat it while we were waiting on our hot food.  They even asked if we wanted to wait on the blizzards till the hot food was done or did we want it now.  The food was what you would expect from a DQ and was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I were at this Dairy Queen on 9/4 @ 3pm. The lady behind the counter who waited us was named Josephina, who needs to have attitude adjustment  and be a little more friendly to the patrons. Was not a pleasant visit for us. There are other Dairy Queens in the area that we will go to."}
{"text":"Sometimes a soft serve strawberry sundae is just the ticket.  I've been pretty good about this, in the 6 years I have lived looking at this location across the street I have only succumbed to the temptation a handful of times.  This time I noticed the interior had been remodeled."}
{"text":"the customer service here is soooo good. we usually come in at night and the lady that works drive thru is sooo nice she always asks \"anything else sweety?\" instead of the usual \"is that it.\"  i love coming to this location! and they have cakes ready if you need a quick one!"}
{"text":"It just opened so they still have some kinks to work out.  I've never eaten at a Dairy Queen before but wasn't too impressed with the food . I will stick to the ice cream there :)"}
{"text":"It has been such a long time since I have eaten at any DQ.  This location is closer to my house, so we decided to go hit the drive thru after dinner tonight.    The DQ sign is lit up on the street and the entrance/exits are easy to use.  The drive thru line was about 5 cars long tonight, I suspect that is typical on a Friday night.  The inside of the store was busy, too.    In spite of the long line of cars, things moved along, the people inside working efficiently.  I ordered a small Heath bar blizzard and M got a large hot fudge sunday with peanuts.  Did you know they offer pecan topping as well?  News to me.  j  The window staff was friendly, and they all seemed to be working well together inside.  Will go here again."}
{"text":"Driving by and decided I need a DQ. Ordered a blizzard and a potato skin appetizer. The potato skin came back half frozen. The blizzard was a mess. Certainly could not turn this upside down. It would have poured out of the cup. Not a DQ experience. Bad service experience."}
{"text":"Oh, I am in love with milkshakes. This branch is cute, like it's from the fifties or something, and it fits in nicely with the whole rockabilly vibe in the Plaza Midwood area.   My favorite is the Blizzard. I'm a fan of Oreos smashed up in vanilla ice cream. The staff here is always quick and friendly, and they are open late enough to make an excellent dessert spot after Penguin or Dish or whenever you find yourself in the area for dinner.   It's not quite as good as Cook-Out, but it's in the Plaza Midwood area, which is a plus, and it's got a cool vibe with the walk-up instead of the drive-through."}
{"text":"mixed response about this place.   They have good prices for some ok fast food.    Their fries were excellent.  The person waiting on me at the window was personable seemed interested in me which is a plus.   They get an extra star for these two reasons. The food is pretty basic but fresh.   My bun was smooshed down so that the top bun was flat.    I had to wait about 4 min for my food.   It was nice and hot so maybe worth the wait and I was there early in the day. They have a donation tray in front of the window like McDonald's has  and it is kind of scuzzy and rusted.  Not what I want to look at when I get my food.   The order board was nice but the window area was scuzzy.   What is with these places that can't pay attention to details.   It isn't just Dairy Queen but almost every other fast food place.   I like fast food.   What I look for at a fast food place in this order: 1 is the board fresh, well lit, clean, easy to read ? 2 am I greeted right away and can I communicate easily with the waiter? 3 Is the waiter cheerful and helpful? 4 Is the waiter personable at the window? 5 is the drive lane and pick up area spotless and beautiful?  6 did my food arrive in a timely basis? 7 Is the food hot and are the ingredients fresh? 8 does the food taste good or is there a weird aftertaste? 9 was the cost appropriate for my meal? One other comment\"   I hate seeing people with boards outside businesses advertising the current sale or discount deal.  I have never seen Dairy Queen do this but Quiznos does this as do some other businesses.  It always looks cheap and demeaning.   I fell really bad for the person doing it and they look really pathetic doing it.   Often you can tell that they are bored to tears and don't want to be there.  I would never do a stupid job like this.   If you want to tell people about your current deal put up a sandwich board that sits on the curb.  It works just as well if not better.  I have responded positively to signs like this but never never never to someone out waving a sign.   If you want to wave me away from a place put someone outside with a sign. Anyway,  that's my rant for the day.  DQ didn't scare me away but invited me with their \"Grill and Chill\" sign and I decided to give them a try.   I might be back.   If they improved their food and serving area I would certainly be back.    Good luck out there."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a blizzard since I had a $5 gift card.  My daughter saw that they had a $5 lunch special and decided to get that instead.  It came with a medium drink, 3 chicken strips, medium fries, and a small sundae.  I thought it was a great deal!  And I \"think\" the chicken is actually real and not like the \"Golden Arches\" nuggets that are factory made.    The location was clean inside and the staff was mostly young, high school age kids but very friendly."}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible. I understand there is o let one person working but when someone orders something, bring out the full order all at once. Half of my order was missing and I stood there waiting for it, the gentleman forgot it and said \"oh right sorry. It's still cooking\" sitting there for so long I nearly asked for my money back."}
{"text":"The ice cream for the blizzards was so soft! We ordered three they showed us one (turned upside down) by the time we got home, three blocks away we had milkshakes! The brownie ala mode was awesome! Think they need to turn the ice cream freezer to super cold as it was very disappointing that we had milkshakes and not blizzards!"}
{"text":"After living in Texas for a few years, I was pleasantly surprised at how quick our trip to DQ was. Over there, it's not unusual for a short line at Dairy Queen to be 4 cars deep.   My wife and I were out running errands and she wanted dessert and this was the first place we saw so we pulled in. Only a few cars, quick service, friendly lady at the window.  We were in and out of that parking lot in under 5 minutes.  My wife got a turtle pecan blizzard without chocolate sauce. Not a super complex order but you'd be surprised how often this one gets messed up at Texas locations I've been to. It came out perfectly mixed, just the way she likes it.  This is definitely a solid location.. Stop by sometime!"}
{"text":"Eh, I feel bad for ol' Dairy Queen. I'm surprised they can still compete with McDonald's, Cold Stone and Gelato joints. DQ was like the ultimate treat when I was a kid, but now I'd only go there for reminiscent moments or desperate need.  Basically, the ice cream is over-priced and this particular location is a tad dumpy. I got the hot fudge sundae and all I kept thinking was...'shoot I should've gone to McDonald's they are 1/3 the price and I get nuts!'"}
{"text":"i'd also like to give 0 stars if i could because i found two long black hairs in my mini sized blizzard... i only got the blizzard because they said they were out of chocolate ice cream so i couldn't get a cone. really grossed out and pissed because i haven't had ice cream in a long time and this was a treat"}
{"text":"Normal layout of a free standing DQ.  The staff is so friendly!!!  I got the small smore blizzard...  OMG...  Party in my mouth...  YUM!!!  And the place is CLEAN!"}
{"text":"The staff was nice, the blizzards bring back memories, but the place was sticky (tables, and chairs).  Ek."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!   Spend your money elsewhere.  We sure will.  Went through drive-thru and ordered a large cone and mini chocolate extreme blizzard.   They have us a large Turtle blizzard and a small p.b. cup blizzard.   Wtf?  We were their only customers too, so how did they mess that up?  Got attitude from the girl when THEIR mistake was nicely pointed out. We thought they corrected it, drove off and the blizzard was wrong.   Drove through again, handed Little Miss Attitude the blizzard and she turned her back on is without saying a word.  A few minutes later she handed us a blizzard and silently shut the window.  As we drove off we found she gave us THE EXACT SAME CUP  we had given back to her...with the wrong flavor and the one bite taken out of it.  Now, completely pissed, we walk between cars now in line, go up to the window and wait while they make the correct item...with Little Miss Attitude smirking at us from the back.  I wrote DQ headquarters,  got a generic reply back and was told they would forward it to the owner.  Now over 2 weeks later I haven't heard from them.  Guess they don't give a crap, and guess we won't be giving them any more of our money .  I hope their store goes out of business...soon."}
{"text":"I usually go to this location. This past week I had a horrible experience. I mentioned to the drive thru attendant that they had made my order wrong on my last visit. She really didn't care and said \"yeah we always get orders wrong\". I ended up paying for my order anyways but I prolly want come here again.  It's sad because all the girls working are usually very nice, the brunette who helped was out to lunch."}
{"text":"Long waits and teenage workers with bad attitudes...nuff' said."}
{"text":"The last two times we have come to this location for blizzards they were soft. No way you could flip it upside down. Tonight still that way and several people were getting refunds. I happen to see people complaining and decided not to order. Young girls were not telling customers up front. I guess this is going to be a continuing problem."}
{"text":"Went to this location after another store not having blizzards hard enough. Line was long and when I got up to pay I ordered 4 small blizzards and was given a total of $18. So I said I thought blizzards were buy one get one for .99. Girl said \"shhh we only give it to people who mention it.\"  Funny the Tv add doesn't say you have to mention it in order to get it.  Tacky!!"}
{"text":"Clean location. Not that many tables inside. There are though many sitting areas located outside. I always get the caramel sundae with mixed nuts. It's so delicious. Something about their ice cream draws me in.   The staff was nice but you could tell they were ready to leave for the night. They were hiding in the back and only came out if a customer came inside.   Plenty of ready to go ice cream cakes. Plus many boxes of the Dilly Bars. Those are so yummy too. This DQ is located near the Old Navy."}
{"text":"Great experience here, came here in desperate need for a birthday cake. They were very nice, great customer service, very helpful. This location had a promotion going on at the time so I got a large ice cream strawberry cheesecake for a great price and they even wrote happy birthday on it. Will definitely be back. The cake was a big hit at the party, every one loved it. The only thing that I wish they could have done different was add actual cake into the ice cream cake. It was delicious, but it was really just ice cream in the shape of cake no cake in it besides little cheese cake bits."}
{"text":"Ordered two chili cheese dogs with a combo. The food was OK. Service was a little rough. Older lady behind the counter was semi rude and had a very bad smokers hack that she wasn't trying to hide. The lady that prepared my hot dogs was standing in food prep area holding a baby.  Im just hoping I dont get sick. I will post back if so. I expect a little more of a tight ship when it comes to food safety procedures at a place like DQ. That reason alone was why I didnt go to the mom and pop stand down the street."}
{"text":"Looking for a smoothie place but it's kinda late night? Dairy Queen closes at 10 and has fruit smoothies in the Orange Julius selection. They are incredibly sweet, though, and not at all 'healthy' like Jamba Juice but hey... Jamba closes at 9... What can ya do? Bahama Bucks is another sweet option and it closes at 10:30!   A small mango pineapple smoothie is $3.02 here, btw!  Warning: it's super super sweet.   Might see ya there - but it won't be for the sm"}
{"text":"Puke Palace!!!  Advisory: This location ONLY!  I use to come here on my lunch breaks because it was right next to where I used to work. I would walk here almost once a week...JUST FOR CONVENIENCE! We only got a half hour lunch so I had to go somewhere close and the only other option was Mc Donald's and I'm not a big fan!   So hmmm where do I begin? Yes its that bad!   Ok the 1st time I came here I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo which after tax was like $8.00bucks!!!...OMG it took 20 minutes for me to get my order which meant I had to scarf this nasty sickening burger down in 5 mins because I still had to walk back to work and clock in!   Not to mention on top of it taking forever to cook it was under cooked I saw it was rare pink!!! I was so pissed off and had no time to complain I just ate the thing and left to work.   I tried this place a few more times only because I didn't have time to eat anywhere else.   The second time I ate here I tried there chicken strips. UMMM they were tasty but had blue dots streaming through them...not sure what that was but hey I'm still living!   After trying various items I came to realize the only tasty and safe thing to order was their chili cheese fries which after tax came to almost 6 bucks for a large.   Luckily I do not nearby anymore and will NOT be returning!   *NASTY FOOD  *OVER PRICED  *DIRTY AND FILTHY DINE IN  *DRUGGED OUT EMPLOYEES   PS: The employees are ALL NASTY and DRUGGED OUT!!!   I witnessed an employee with dirty finger nails. Also no washing of hands or gloves while touching raw and cooked food. This location seems more of a health department issue than anything else.   Please if you can avoid eating at THIS Dairy Queen Please avoid it! at all costs!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a chicken sandwich and a blizzard.   The chicken had a dab of mayo, the rusty core from the lettuce, and my Blizzard is disgusting.  It's rotten milk/ice cream if it wasn't so hot outside I'd go back.  Literally rotten.  Total waste of money, and time.  So gross.  And the location was sketchy too.  Some random guy walking through the parking lot came up to my car to talk to my dog that was in the car it wasn't a comfortable moment.  Won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"S'mores blizzard is back!  So good!  Ok, only average at this location    It's 6:00 on a Monday night, there is one other couple there, it took 15 minutes for two blizzards.  There were 4-5 employees and one, who seemed to be doing all the work was obviously new so the other employees were making him do all the work.   If you're needing an ice cream fix and it's close, give it a try. Location was clean"}
{"text":"I love my dairy queen. They have the best soft serve ice cream out there. Better than McDonalds by far. Service has always been fast and good when I come here."}
{"text":"What a mess.  After making my pumpkin blizzard. They tried to use a regular soda lid on the large then forgot the whip cream.  Next after asking for whip they forgot the pumpkin spice.  Asian guy working was on the side using his cell.   Had to ask for the spice in another container so I could put it on the blizzards myself for the kids.   Wtf?????  It was soo freakin messy and it looked like an ice cream shoved into a cola container at first.  This place needs a serious employee training so they know never to serve something with less quality to the customer."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I've ever had. They served us RAW CHICKEN& old food, and then when I came in to get my refund  (manager approved) they told me to go Dive in my dumpster and get the raw chicken and bring it back in order for a refund."}
{"text":"I visited earlier today during a quieter time of day just after the lunch time rush. The service was friendly at the counter. I ordered my food and sat down. Some time passed and I haven't heard anything, more time passes and more customers come in and then I noticed they're getting food right away while I've been waiting for 20 minutes now. I walk back to the counter and ask about my order. Come to find out my order never made it to the cooks to make my food. I immediately demand a refund and leave since my lunch break has been ruined and I didn't have time to get food elsewhere. This is not the first time I've had this type of service at this location but this is beyond mere carelessness. I'm not the only one who was stuck waiting for much longer than reasonable. Management should really look into this. That kind of service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The drive through staff is really friendly and patient with my indecisive self. I usually just come for my usual and favorite Julius Strawberry Banana. The food is obviously not of great quality, as I think their main highlight here are the shakes. Great food deals, but portions are small. VERY SMALL. I only grab food here when I'm dying of starvation, and is craving a smoothie at the same time. It's just efficient to kill two birds with one stone this way."}
{"text":"You scream I scream we all scream for Ice Cream! A Icon of a location sets the standard for all DQ's. When you go here you are in DQ world... The only bad thing about it is when you walk up to the counter to order you feel like your in a Pawn shop in a \"Not so good part of Town\" because , you are talking to someone threw a small window..."}
{"text":"They do not allow high schoolers who are paying costumers use their restroom that is against health code and discrimination"}
{"text":"This DQ is right by our house, but we haven't eaten here in over 7 years. My boys wanted to go tonight, so we went with the expectation of getting something decent to eat, with dessert after. Huge problems: the food was terrible - markedly smaller portions than the other comparable chains and served lukewarm to almost cold. The bun on my burger was stale, and the cheese on top was hard and cold.  You have to have the temperature right when you serve stuff: cold just does not cut it. I can say that even though the service was just average, the kids who worked there were pleasant enough. The dining area also appeared to be clean, for the most part. My sons both had a Blizzard, and were happy with those. My advice is to only go here for dessert. If you want a decent meal, go to Culver's or Freddy's, as the food was almost inedible here. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"I hate to do this to my beloved DQ, but this location is TRASH!  After ordering & tipping generously, we were handed two \"Chocolate Lovers\" Blizzards WITHOUT CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.  Sure, this may be a petty thing to complain about, but after bringing up that my favorite Blizzard (that I order EVERY TIME) normally comes with chocolate ice cream, the sad, old a**hole behind the counter (I'd put his name here, but he wasn't wearing a name tag...or gloves... Basically, he just looked like a grumpy, 40+ year old white guy) very rudely decided to finally explain that this location NEVER has chocolate ice cream... only vanilla soft serve... which I find VERY hard to believe. Why would you have a \"Chocolate Lovers\" menu but NO chocolate ice cream?! F*****g bizarre.  Not to mention, he had NO idea what goes in each Blizzard. I watched him go back & forth from the menu to read what to put into the mixer. One of those ingredients being f*****g stale brownies.  To sum things up: F*** this place, and f*** that middle-aged s**t-bag."}
{"text":"Pretty good food except for the ice cream, especially banana splits is way better at the indian school location, huge difference, they really should go there and see what it should look like.Here you get half the desert."}
{"text":"Stopping in for a treat was painful. They are now blasting horrible music LOUDLY so you can't have a nice chat with friends without YELLING AT THEM."}
{"text":"Cici served us and she was very sweet & polite. Food was as per expected and we were all very happy to have picked this location to have our late lunch in."}
{"text":"I can hardly believe the experience I just had at this Dairy Queen. Last Friday I bought a blizzard, and when the employee handed it to me, she didn't tip it upside side down so I kindly pointed it out so I could get a free one next time as per Dairy Queen's policy. She laughed a bit and then wrote on the back of a receipt \"didn't tip...free.\" Tonight I went to redeem that free blizzard, and when I gave it to the cashier in the drive-through, she looked at it kind of funny and then said she had to go ask a manager to check it. When the manager came to the window, she said \"you realize it doesn't work like that? You can't just write it on the receipt. We have to give you a coupon, or you have to call-in\" in a demeaning, smirky way. I couldn't believe it! I explained that it had been given to me by an employee and that I didn't know any better. She then asked me to wait while she checked to see who was working that night! Why do I need to be there for that?! I used to love this Dairy Queen, and I've been going here ever since it opened. Not anymore...I have been frustrated for a while because they never seem to actually freeze their blizzards, and that was the last straw."}
{"text":"What a joke. It's not the Dairy Queen I was brought up on. The person taking our order had no idea what he was doing. Over charge us on everything. Burger was raw bacon was ice cold. Maybe just stick to ice cream can't F that up I hope. Will not return to this location  and they ran out of fry's"}
{"text":"Not in the best shape compared to the Dunkin Donuts next door. The blizzards are superb as always. They have never been out of cookie dough. That bodes well for them in my book."}
{"text":"Wow the 5 buck lunch special was amazing!!! If you are looking for a inexpensive lunch that will fill you up. This is the place"}
{"text":"Great DQ, the one we've been going to ever since we were kids.  Even when there's a lineup out the door (which there often is) the line moves really fast, and they seem to never have any less than 7 cashiers working at any given time.  I don't find it to be \"ghetto\" as Dave said below, it's just an older building!  But it's clean and the ice cream is tasty as ever  I'll have a skor blizzard with strawberry, please!"}
{"text":"First off, I want to say that I've been here multiple times. Each time resulted in \"intense intestinal distress\" within one hour of eating my blizzard. Don't ask why I continued to go back- I clearly have an ice cream addiction.  Recently, I went there with my boyfriend. We each got blizzards and sine it was a nice day, we decided to walk around Plaza Midwood while eating our treats. We really only walked around 15 minutes- by the time we finished our blizzards we were in front of Fuel and threw out our containers in front of the restaurant. Well, as we crossed the street, I saw my car was being booted. I went up to the booter, explained that I had been a customer. He asked if I had a receipt, which of course I didn't. I pointed out the DQ employee who had waited on us and said she could vouch. Unfortunately, this lovely red headed slack jawed hillbilly could remember when we had been there. It was a total disaster.  If you must go here to satisfy a soft serve craving, get in your car and drive home with your frosty treat: 1) you will be booted if you wander too far and 2) you are a short time from some serious bathroom issues and you will want to be close to home."}
{"text":"Please update the details of this location . We made a 25min drive here yesterday only to find the location is permanently closed . The next closest location is another 15mins from there ."}
{"text":"I still find it the most strangest thing for Dairy Queen to just have ice cream without the food too! Growing up on the east coast when someone mentioned Dairy Queen I immediately thought of poutine and burgers!  This location is always lined up out the door in the summer, usually only two people working and they can not handle the demand of ice cream.   It is located right in between Empress Walk and the Sheppard Centre, and being on the subway line I am sure they get more business as well,  This location used to only be open in the summer which would make sense because there isn't a high demand for ice cream but since then alot of things have changed, they still do a fairly reasonable business in the winter.  It is nice to spot in on a hot day and evening walk for a treat!"}
{"text":"We ordered the smores and m&m blizzards and wife order butterscotch dipped cone. They loved it all!  Crowded and tight seating but service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was typical Dairy Queen, the stars are for the service we got.    The lady running the cash register was on top of her game, and very nice.  Napkins, salt, pepper, and catchup with my wife's burger meal.  Gave us the dipped cone after the meal.  (9/28/2014 around 6 pm.)"}
{"text":"It was actually fun to go to dairy queen with my son. We both got the A1 bacon meal for $5 and upgraded our dessert to a blizzard for $1. The burger was a little small. But it was really good and the blizzard was delicious. I rarely go to Dairy Queen but I was feeling nostalgic so we decided to have lunch there and I'm glad we did. The food was really good and I enjoyed being with my son."}
{"text":"If I could it rate this Dairy Queen with 0 stars I would! I don't know if it was a fly landing on me while I was waiting in line or if it was the multiple fruit flies bombarding the menus against the wall that was more disgusting. if that wasn't bad enough I had to wait while the employees spoke to each other in the back before even noticing me for a good five plus minutes. needless to say there was nothing Queen like about this experience."}
{"text":"Finally we got a DQ on the west side! Woohoo! Who doesn't love the good old fashioned blizzards we all grew up eating?  I know I do.  The only time I don't is when they don't use enough mix-ins and you end up with disappointment in a cup.  We've all had to endure that in our lifetime.  I was seriously hoping for the best when I tried out our new DQ.. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed!  I hope it wasn't just a lucky night.. cause my blizzard was packed with yumminess!  I ordered the salted caramel blizzard and my daughter the cookie dough.  I can't speak for hers but mine was perfection.  It had tons of mix ins and I was a happy camper.  I highly suggest giving this flavor a try! It was filled with chocolate pieces that had caramel inside.  This is a brand new building so of course it's very nice inside and out. I'm not sure I'd eat regular food from here but DQ has great desserts. The service was great and upbeat. we of course, will be back."}
{"text":"Josh who works there is the best ! 10/10 I'm only coming to this diary queen. It's about 15 mins away from my house and I would rather come here than the one close to my house. Josh thank you for making my experiences great!"}
{"text":"i had bought a cake from my local store and it tasted spoiled, i've never had an issue before. i had called the store and spoke to Joanna and she said she can't help me with an exchange or refund. it's disappointing & embarrassing when you buy a cake for someone's birthday, then have to take everyone's plate back to make sure they do not get sick. she refused to let me speak to a supervisor or manager, then hung up on me. i called back to get her name, and at the end she asked \"anything else so i can hang up\" at that point i'm not going to deal with an attitude from an employee, so i hung up. she then continued to call me back to back, and said you never answered my question \"anything else so i can hang up\" seriously!? what kind of store goes out their way to be so rude?!    UPDATE:  her husband had texted me asking when a good time the store \"owner\" can contact me to assist me with my issue.   so i answer the call and guess who it is  Joanna.  she acted as if she had no idea on what happened. she asked me how can she help me.  she continued to be completely RUDE and hung up on me once again.  there's no reason why she needs to contact me anymore regarding the same situation   i have working in the food industry for over 5 years, and customer service almost 10 years this is not the way you handle situations."}

{"text":"I can't believe how rude the employees are at this location.  We came in last night 4/1/15 and not only was it very akward as we walked in  because of the no hello or welcome. I ordered a snickers blizzard with cheese cake. I guess the young cashier threw in the side of rudeness for free. This dairy queen will be closed down in 5 years just like the shopping center that it is in. I'm born and raised here in las vegas and I've seen many dairy queens close. This one will be next if it doesn't change it ways."}
{"text":"It's a very sad day when your Oreo blizzard has nothing but vanilla ice cream in the bottom 3/4."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place went under new management. Ever since the new owners have bought it it's been horrible service. We've been in there several times and each time it's like we're putting them out for whatever order we have. They are not happy they don't smile. We asked for certain blizzard when they gave it to us it was the wrong one when we advise them it was the wrong one we got nothing but attitude back. As a local I guess I will just buy my stuff is in town driving through Henderson"}
{"text":"Didn't know was close to my house, most off them close already. So happy I found it here, weather too hot need a very big ice cream"}
{"text":"$5 Lunch? Hell yes.   For $5, I got a chicken finger basket with fries, a drink, and a hot fudge sundae. Yes please.   I was very pleased with the food. Hot, fresh, good portions. Atmosphere was good too, clean, friendly. Place was PACKED but there was enough seating for everyone.   Will be back for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Smells. Like sewer?  Water problems? Old blood?? And old grease. Strange little shop. No drive thru due to location. Employees are always nice. Take dogs here for children's vanilla cones."}
{"text":"Craving for ice cream, and haven't had a blizzard for so long. Got a small oreo blizzard but it cost about $6... the ice cream wasn't creamy or anything.. i was so sad. I guess i got used to Mitchell's Ice cream or Tillamook Ice cream which were a lot more fuller and used authentic dairy."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with Dairy Queen after our recent visit.   I was really looking forward to a dipped butterscotch cone & was told this location doesn't have butterscotch.   So I settled with some hot Apple pie & ice cream thing.   The amount of ice cream was minimal,  lots of \"crust\", very very little apple in this whole dessert then it was all covered in a very sickening sweet carmel.  It probably wouldn't have been to bad if I could've had more apples or ice cream in there and alot less carmel.   Not sure if I'll ever visit again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply amazing. It's the only fast food restaurant in Cave Creek, and boy do they know how to run it!  The food is, well, DQ, so you can't go wrong there. Also, the restaurant is kept constantly clean- cleaner than any average fast food place, because the night closers work so hard to make it look good. The people who work there are generally extremely nice and polite, and will treat you like a real person and not just another random customer.  My only gripe is that they don't have Cherry Dip. Get on that, DQ! There's simply no replacement for it!  I highly suggest this place for any ice-cream or food. It's family friendly, fun, clean, and delicious."}
{"text":"I have had a great experience every time I have come to this Dairy Queen! Everyone is so helpful if I want to try something new or when I get my usual!  I've been coming here for years because I live around the corner and they never dissappoint!"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed. Limited menu items and the staff liked saying, \"no we aren't like the other stores\". I say liked because they basically told us to go somewhere else and so we did."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Lobby was filthy. Service was horrible. Food order was incomplete. Too bad that this shop is going to be out of business due to crap management."}
{"text":"These are suppose to be mediums but look more like smalls. Plus they had no chocolate soft serve ice cream. Very disappointing!  Update: No chocolate ice cream...again. Third time in the past 4 weeks. We ended up taking a ride to the Rock Hill location."}

{"text":"I visited this DQ a couple months ago and had a bad experience (was not Yelped) and was in the area last night so I talked the wife into trying it again.  Unfortunately, it was another bad experience!  We ordered in the drive thru as we normally do.  The person working the window took my card, closed the window and was gone for about 3-5 minutes.  He opened the window back up, gave me my card and our order. I started to drive away and he yelled wait.  The car behind me moved so I parked and went in.  He advised he had not swiped my card so the order was not paid for. I waited at the counter an additional 5 minutes while they proceeded to help other customers (meanwhile our order of two blizzards is melting! We get home and the lids were not on the cups right, there was ice cream all over the cups and it was just a mess!  I think I will avoid this DQ moving forward."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to. Every time I go, my blizzard ends up as just a cup of ice cream with maybe 2 tiny pieces of candy. I've tried ordering extra candy... I just get charged more for my plain cup of ice cream. I've tried letting them know that \"the last time something was wrong and I ended up with a plain cup of ice cream\"... still get the same result. So today, after getting my plain cup of ice cream in the drive thru, I parked, went inside and told them my issue. He remade my blizzard without any hassle, handed it to me.... IT'S JUST PLAIN ICE CREAM AGAIN!!  I'm done wasting money here. I'll be going elsewhere from now on. It's not like they are the only ice cream place in the area. If you own this place - please make some changes."}
{"text":"It's a Dairy Queen in the far south Calgary off Macleod Trail and have good portions and service is fantastic.   Store is large and has a drive thru. Orange Julius is here too.   Location is good as it's on a corner lot that leads into Shawnessy shopping centre.   Overall the quality is decent but pricing has increased over the years but can't say no to blizzards."}
{"text":"I went through their drive through last night for a blizzard.  I ordered a double reeses and butterscotch and it was delish!  There were a couple of cars ahead of me in line but they kept the line moving fast.  The guy at the window was friendly and polite.  They are a very efficient crew, it took maybe 30 seconds for my transaction at the window."}
{"text":"Shame me once fool on you, shame me twice, fool on me!   Well needless to say, today was the second time (in a looooong time) I decided to give my DQ down the road a try.... Apparently they don't read their Yelp reviews or even care what the customer has to say because once more as I went through the drive thru and ordered 2 large TWIST ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl the person at the window either needs to have their ears checked, hearing aids implemented or just plain be banished from this earth because I was served 2 VANILLA ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl..... looking at my receipt - AMAZING 2 TWIST ice creams were ordered (so I'm not crazy- Hallelujah!)  Dairy Queen, I'm done- stick a fork in me. And you're lucky I didn't  just throw my ice creams at the idiotic lady who served me... At this point the assault charges that would have followed would be worth it after numerous times you've failed to serve the customer correctly."}

This location, compared to all other locations I've been in the Pittsburgh area, does a FANTASTIC job with this particular blizzard.  I don't know what they do, but it's so much better than any salted caramel truffle blizzard made by any other location by a landslide.  More chocolate?  More truffles?  I don't know, but kudos to whoever has the heavy hand at this Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Let's start with the owner.  I was prepared to YELP this DQ based on the service I got.  I went to the Spring Mountain DQ in Chinatown. That one was out of everything and really just poorly maintained tonight was my first and last time in there. I asked for a PLAIN cheeseburger and said PLAIN several times. It wasn't plain which I found out on my way home.    I decided to stop at this one on Rainbow because it looks nicer. I figured I could get what the Spring Mountain one was out of and get my burger done right.  I had my receipt which clearly shows my burger is seven whole minutes old. I explained to the counter girl who was very nice that my burger from the other place was wrong and they were out of things can they help me?   The owner REFUSED to replace my $2.85 cheeseburger.  Because it's different owners. WHAT?? It's the same company. It's DQ right? It's not a steak and lobster dinner that we are talking about.  IT IS A CHEESEBURGER!!!! No, I don't have anything else better to do tonight as a fat, white, single woman than complain about a stupid cheeseburger. He can't file some sort of thing with the company that he needs to be reimbursed for almost $3.00? I bet competitors like MCD's would NEVER say oh we can't get you a new burger because it's a different owner.  I said I was never going back to the other location.  Wouldn't you want to be a hero and ensure I put my money in your pocket instead? So you got my money ONCE. And that is the LAST time you'll get money from me. Don't spend it all in one place.   I'll also be contacting headquarters because I spent $2.85 on one cheeseburger that was wrong and a second $2.85 on one an owner representing a brand name chose to charge me for a second time rather than ensure brand quality and BRAND LOYALTY. From the looks of the empty parking lot they can use all the customers they can get. And while my second burger that I paid for from Rainbow was correct it tasted so vile I tossed it out the window.  If I'd gotten the customer service from the OWNER I expected my review would have been more favorable and I would have left out the gross food. No, I don't want gift cards I never plan on going back to ANY DQ ever. My first time to DQ was Spring Mountain.  I gave DQ a second chance and RAINBOW blew that one as well.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SLOP"}
{"text":"First of all, they don't have ICE for beverages, so expect a warm soda. The employees acted odd and made the visit uncomfortable. I'm assuming they weren't properly trained when it comes to hospitality. The only plus side was that the food came out fast."}
{"text":"The manager aka Khaleesi (game of thrones) was very polite super awesome and very much friendly. I've been coming to this DQ for over 15 years and will never go anywhere else. If there was ever a problem , you speak to her and she'll take care of you make sure everyone is satisfied and walking out happy. Everyone should call her khaleesi she'll like that. Plus side your visit will be 100x better with smiles all around. Will be back later this evening for more cones and blizzards!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up a free cone on DQ's anniversary. Unfortunately it wasn't chocolate dipped as advertised."}
{"text":"Horrible lately. How do u wait in line for over 12 minutes and not even get an apology or smile!  I keep shooting my own foot off by going here but i just cannot help it i am addicted to blizzards!! That said, i hate this place....Why is it called fast food when everytime there is a 10 min wait and the staff are very blah and mean!!  I would love it if they shut this location down so i didnt have to get mad at myself for continuing to fall into the trap."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times. The food is DQ food which is ok, but I have asked every time about Wi-Fi and they always say the owner will not allow them to give out password. I have asked for comment cards and the answer is always, we don't have any. I have asked when is owner going to be in and no one ever knows."}
{"text":"Fairly new so I love having DQ treats close at hand. Clean and friendly. Size of cone servings could be more consistent. I'm impressed with the service. All of the staff I see are high school and college age."}
{"text":"This is a pretty much cookie cutter Dairy Queen.  It has everything you would expect to find in a Dairy Queen.  The access to the highway is easy, and the bathrooms are clean..."}
{"text":"These guys are so extremely polite! So eager to service. The food is delicious and fast! First time actually eating inside a Dairy Queen, and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was stoked to visit a Dairy Queen since they don't have one where I live in LA but I was bummed when I ordered the cookie dough blizzard and the vanilla ice cream tasted like fat free frozen yogurt from the 90s. Not a true vanilla taste, but I'd go back to try something else."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen but the service at this location is horrible. I come here about once a week for a dessert treat so I know it's not an isolated incident. There is never soap in the bathroom, so I'm not sure how employees wash their hands before returning to work. Today I watched the cashier take our order with gloves on then walk straight back to grab the cones with the gloves on after handling our cash. You can frequently hear the drive through customers trying to talk to the employees over the speakers, yet they are ignored. To add to this, they place their blizzard ads upside down (so they are right side up, and the text is upside down), I'm guessing because they don't understand blizzards are suppose to be served upside down? The employees who work the register or drive through are always rude and preoccupied. The other day the man working asked if we were ready to order. We said yes. And he said go ahead. So we ordered. During this time he turned around fumbling through bags, talking to other employees, and basically completely forgot we were standing there. He then turned back around and said oh. Did u order yet? On top of the bad service our order has not been right in months. The worst thing is they can't dip a cone properly. They dip down to a 1/4 of an inch from the cone, rather than dipping over the edge of the cone. Making the ice cream just flood down the cone. I wish there was another DQ near by, because sadly I am addicted to these sweet treats, but I'm going to have to attempt to stop coming here because it puts me in such a horrible mood."}
{"text":"Ice cream was typical for DQ but neighborhood was a bit sketchy on a Saturday evening. A guy outside had a holstered firearm.   Very small store. Very limited seating.   My only concern was how well they cleaned the Blizzard machine. Just looked like it needed some cleaning. No one got sick so probably fine too."}
{"text":"I have been here after work a few times already and I love it. They are always fast and very courteous. I have never had any trouble with my orders here and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nasty....horrible service. The guy making the hot dog was not wearing any gloves, rubbing his nose with his fingers, running his fingers through his hair which also had no hair net, hat or visor then with the same dirty fingers stuck them into the bucket of cheese and sprinkled it on the hot dogs. The spoon that was used for the chili was kept in  bucket of dirty water. The idiots guy at the window which I assume was assistant manager continue to lie to me saying he was wearing gloves all while I just sat there and watched him do all of this without any gloves. No Integrity dirty and Liars. He's such a little bitch he came back four more times to tell me you was wearing gloves like he was some sort of 10 year old kid trying to argue with me."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is clutch for whenever I have ice cream cravings. The employees were really kind and greeted us from the moment we entered the store.   The price is decent here. The ice cream is quite affordable and it's ice cream! It tastes really good. You can get either a waffle cone or a plastic cup."}
{"text":"All I can say is, read the reviews because they are not lying. I wish I would have read the reviews before going here but we were in a hurry to get home and this happened to be the first DQ we saw on the way. When we pulled in it was really dark and had a strange feeling about the location. There were no cars ahead of us yet when we pulled up it a took a while for the employee to greet us. Once she did we had to repeat ourselves 5 times before she finally told us to just go to the window because she couldn't hear us. Once we got to the window we ended up having to repeat ourselves another 3 times before she finally repeated our order correctly (which was a small snickers blizzard, small fries, and a $1.89 vanilla cone dipped in chocolate). First she handed us a tiny vanilla cone so we handed it back to her telling her we wanted the 1.89 cone dipped. She took the cone and brought the same one back only dipped in chocolate then handed us the blizzard and told us to wait for the fries. We ended up waiting an additional 5 minutes just for the fries. We would have just left had we not already paid. I would not recommend an establishment with incompetent employees and terrible service such as this. It was as if the employees did not want customers because they didn't want to atually have to do their job. I wouldnt be surprised if they were doing drugs in the back"}
{"text":"Pretty good hamburgers.  Fries are always freshly made and hot.  I do wish they weren't so tight with the fry sauce.   Ice cream is always delicious.   Yes, I would not hesitate to go back?"}
{"text":"I go here often since there are few dairy queens around, however I agree with others. Staff are slow, lacking life, and don't wash hands before preparing food and handling the til. This place needs a sprucing up."}
{"text":"This place Sucks, the lobby closes a half hour early, and they lock the people inside"}
{"text":"Finally we were able to stop by when there wasn't 2 million people in line.  I decided to go with the turtle pecan blizzard this evening.  The turtles and pecans were amazing!  However, if they would have turned my blizzard upside down to show off like they usually do then my whole dessert would come running out since it was melted.  I will try again!"}
{"text":"My daughters need it to use only the restroom and cashier was so rude and ask to buy something.  Never ever stop by here again."}
{"text":"I very rarely give a review, let alone a less favorable review. I ordered I banana split.  The banana was so unripe I could barely cut through it and it barely tasted like a banana. I asked for double fudge and no pineapple. I barely had a topping. I was so disappointed to say the least. Definitely not how I. Remembered Dairy Queen to be."}
{"text":"Regular DQ place. No worse no better than other franchise stores. I love their dipped cones. Hey, at least they are better than Mac Donald's ! :)  One tip: if you're a Danforth local don't bother coming here on weekends. Since it is right next to the pottery road entrance to the DVP - it is full of suburbia people who crowd the place and the queues are humongous ! Also their stinky cars are smelling up the parking lot where the outdoor tables and chairs are. Danforth locals bike or walk ! Save the Earth! Fight Global Warming! :)"}
{"text":"We actually stopped for a meal not the treats.  Burger is very good, if you only get icecream here you should try some of there hot eats!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a \"no star\" option because this place is a joke! They should not even be allowed to use the DQ brand and logo because their excuse for a \"sandwich\" and a bag of chips would be comical if not for the complete waste of time in getting off of the highway and presented with no options for any real food should be criminal!"}
{"text":"DQ Blizzard with Heath bar crunches is so good! Line wrapped around the building for drive thru! Soooo Good!"}
{"text":"This is where the old Arby's use to be.   They have a variety of food and desserts from DQ and Grill & Chill.   DQ: Classic treats like sundaes, banana splits, and cones. Blizzards, desserts a la mode, frappes, shakes, and malts. They also have Orange Julius smoothies.  Grill & Chill: hot sandwiches, chicken strips, salads, $5 lunch specials (11 am to 4 pm), hot dogs, burgers, and a kids meal.   I only got the desserts and they tasted fine. I came in during a slow day so they were really quick with my order. Nothing to complain. I'll definitely be back to try the burger & fries menu."}
{"text":"Since hiring a new gm this place has been worth coming to they make the ice cream like they used to I would highly recommend this location...."}
{"text":"Myself and a coworker went in on 8/28/17 at approx 12:30pm for a quick lunch. We requested 2 of the $6 meals which included 2 chili cheese dogs, 1 fry, 1 drink, and 1 sundae. After we ordered, the guy working said \"our deep fryer is down\" and he charged us $5.38. He then told us that their ice machine is broken so he couldn't give us our drinks. This all happened after we already payed. So basically we payed almost $6 for 2 shitty chili cheese dogs."}
{"text":"I've been to this location dozens of times and I order the same thing every time. Today I went and I had a Groupon. My Reece's peanut butter cup blizzard had zero chunks of candy. I was very disappointed. Was it because I had a Groupon?  I'll never know. I would've taken it back if I had discovered it sooner. Boo"}
{"text":"This use to be the place to come get your ice cream what back in the early 00s.   Now it's a run down place barley holding onto life. The last time I came to this place was mid sep 15.  I walked in a hole in the roof water coming in fast with a few buckets.  This place needs a makeover to be back in the future"}
{"text":"Not good!  Walked in around 930 pm and the place was a hot mess. From the floors to the bathroom to the dirty and unkept area behind the counter, I should have taken the clue. My blizzard came and it looked runny. It even tasted strange and rotten. Within an hour I was pretty sick. Never had a bad ice cream experience before this one. Really disappointing"}
{"text":"The service was quick and the cashier girl was nice. I ordered vanilla shake with malt and got shake that tasted more like mocha/vanilla so I was a little disappointed. The other two drinks I ordered for friends were good. Oreo blizzard ice cream was the BEST!"}
{"text":"They have everything other DQs have, including a fast drive thru. The only thing that doesn't give them a 5-Star rating is when you go in. They are S.L.O.W. Most of it comes down to the high school staff and a lot of new employees."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen, but this location is awful. The service is terrible, and has been on dozens of occasions- I went through the drive thru and when I got home realized my order was wrong. I called and the manager told me I would have a free meal the next time I came in, and when I came in the guy told me I was only down for free fries and was incredibly rude about the whole thing. Another time I drove through and it was my boyfriend's first time at dq, so I wanted to show him the blizzard trick. I turned it upside down and the whole thing spilled onto my lap, and the two ladies at the window started laughing hysterically closed the window, and i went in to complain and they said that the upside down blizzard trick \"is like so outdated\""}
{"text":"Ugh, I am not a fan of Dairy Queen.  I came here a few nights when I was in AZ because my little sister wanted to go.  This place can be pretty entertaining for people watching, though.  Lots of kids showing up after sports games, and families that should NOT be going to Dairy Queen every night like they are.  Oh, America."}
{"text":"Took a long time to order. Was very unhappy with this place came home to my ice cream all melted, I don't know how they can even be selling this to customers. It wasn't even 10 mins after I got home to this mess. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Best strawberry cheese quake ever!!! -- mixed all the way to the bottom with fruit and cheesecake pieces.  I usually get just plain ice cream for like 1/4 of the bottom of the cup. This was just perfect.  This is not my neighborhood but definitely will be back for my blizzard here when I'm in the area.  Fast and friendly drive thru."}
{"text":"Ordered a mini royal blizzard.  It was certainly a mini.  The problem was that it was $ 4.00.  The frozen yogurt was ok...the blizzard was ok....just so small for such a large price for yogurt.  For about the same price, you can get gelato or custard at a specialty shop.  For the size and quality of the yogurt, I would suggest McDonalds...only $ 1.29 and you get just as much.  Oh...and the outside tables were dirty...obviously not wiped down for quite some time.  Probably the last time I visit DQ."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times and it's failed! First of all the mini blizzards will run you $3.55.....yes I said MINI!!! Second there is something wrong with the ice cream or milk they're using or they need to clean the machine. Both times the blizzards have tasted like sour milk and my kids stomachs have ached afterwards. They need to get it together here!"}
{"text":"Update now that Yelp has added the correct hours for this location.  I grew up loving DQ. But this store's hours on the official DQ website are wrong (the actual hours are much shorter). That would usually be forgivable, but they've been wrong for months and I've notified store staff multiple times. Plus, store cleanliness is an issue here, and staff can be brutally slow at times (although they are usually pretty friendly).  Bottom line is there are nearby frozen treat spots that probably deserve our support more than a big chain that can't even be bothered to update its website hours - and many of those places offer a better product, too (just check my other reviews...).  Sorry, DQ. It's long overdue, and I think it's time for us to break up."}
{"text":"Great way to cool down.  Pleasant friendly staff.  This place is AWESOME now. It's cleaner and staff if efficient and super down to earth.  The new Manager or lead during the day the last few times I've been seems to know what she's doing.   It's just different vibe. Give her a raise! Ha. Thank you Dairy Queen.   I'm a blizzard lover!   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice ppl and good service. But no chocolate ice cream...really?   We only go there because they were the ONLY ones around who still have chocolate ice cream--and one of the workers assured me that would continue because the boss was really big on chocolate.  Went in today--none. Only on the weekends, the guy said. No clue why the boss changed it. SUPPOSEDLY ppl don't ask for it during the week. Well, we did. And according to the workers, lots of ppl ask for it all week long; as a matter of fact, another DQ sent us there, knowing that they were the ONLY DQ around still serving chocolate ice cream.  FYI great workers; quite nice, and friendly, and helpful.  BUT--it's in a strip mall and not on the end, so no drive-thru.    My son signed up for the birthday club and they called him and gave him a month to come get his free treat. Nice.  But still, no chocolate is a big thing for me, and since I'm driving, we probably won't be going too much anymore unless he wants vanilla."}
{"text":"I go to dairy Queen at least 40 times a year and this is by far the worst Dairy Queen I have been to. The hours on the sign are not updated and are not reflective of what Google maps says they are; leaving all of the lights and the sign on when they are closed. Their systems are constantly down, including today when it is 107 degrees outside and people want ice cream. No taking of cash when systems are out and no idea when they will have it fixed."}
{"text":"I popped in for a burger one day while driving between job sites. Being one of the only fast food options in the area this location is probably the busiest I've seen for people grabbing actual food and not just ice cream.  Its Dairy Queen, so it lived up to its mediocrity."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with DQ's but they always seem sticky to me. I never want to touch anything because I have this feeling that I'm going to put my hand in something gooey.  This store has always done ok by me though. I've come in for a couple of blizzards and they've always been made well. Never stingy on the toppings."}
{"text":"Really like the Blizzards and the cheese curds. Have tried many others items and I would have to give the other menu items a big thumbs down. Service is a hit and miss situation. Sometimes the drive thru flows smoothly and then there are times when it is backed up with a twenty minute wait. This last visit, my Blizzard cup had a hole in the bottom. Hello, lack of quality control!"}
{"text":"Used this location for convenience but do to the excellent service and product quality, will for sure, will use again. We were thinking of a fairly inexpensive but unique way to thank some of our nurses for Nurse's Week. I made a couple of offerings and everyone wanted Blizzards. From the gentleman who courteously took my order over the phone to the very helpful staff when I arrived, it was a very positive experience. Even offering to put ice in bags to transport as I had about 17. I highly recommend this DQ. Very clean and tidy decor too. Small location but no reason to be any bigger.  Only draw back...which is not their fault. Construction is in progress on road getting to them."}
{"text":"Just picked up a Blizzard to nom on. No complaints. This location seems bigger inside than most I've visited. I went through the drive thru and had no issues with customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my sister one day to grab some blizzards. The inside of the shop is very dirty and seems unsanitary. The staff was rude and their hygiene was lacking. Needless to say, we walked out and went to another location."}
{"text":"This is my first and last time going to this DQ. I was visiting a friend and this was the closest location. I ordered a cheeseburger with only ketchup, yet they put pickles and mustard on it. The worst was that I ordered another sandwich and ask them them to just grill the bread with cheese then add the tomato lettuce onion etc. as my friend is a vegetarian.  When we got back we found that not only was my food wrong, but hers was a mess! It looked like they put everything on the bun, smashed it, then threw it in the microwave for five minutes. As you can see from the photo, it was soggy and gross.  Customer service was no better. They all seemed to have attitudes. A lady was mad when I went in because they wouldn't give her a dome lid for her blizzard and the guy argued with her! It's just a kid for crying out loud. I called the manager and told him what happened and all he had to say is \"okay.\" I said \"what do you mean okay?\" He says \"well what do you want me to do about it?\" What a jerk! I asked for the store number, email and owners name, of which, he only knew the owners names. If anyone wants to know, they are Arnie and Susan and there from 11-4 Monday to Friday. Needless to say, I will be paying them a visit and contacting corporate. I'm sure they would like to know how one of their franchise locations is doing."}
{"text":"This is a tiny Dairy Queen location and it's almost always packed. I have to say the staff is unfailingly courteous and operates with admirable efficiency. They have always gotten my order right, and given correct change as well.   The product is standard, unpretentious DQ always delicious dairy treats as well as an assortment of fried fast food standards including chicken strips and burgers, and a couple theoretically not  unhealthy grilled or crispy chicken salads as well.    There's seating for perhaps 12. The interior is clean and well lit. There's no drive-through but there is adequate parking.  The location is a bit barren  and not particularly inviting, but the restaurant itself is comfortable and I think the tight quarters actually make for a more friendly dining experience. Consistently good product and excellent service I've had far worse and far worse in more sophisticated , far more  expensive environs."}
{"text":"Though I would \"sneak\" an occasional cone at Mickey's or a hi-brow gelato now and then, or more frequently rationalize a frozen yogurt, post-middle aged expansion of the mid-section discouraged me from returning to DQ, THE original frozen dessert-centric franchise.  It's been too long: DQ is still the queen and king of soft-serve ice cream (or ice milk, as may be proper).    While I haven't tried the sandwiches in years (they used to have a killer BBQ sandwich), ice cream desserts still reign supreme at the Dairy Queen. From simple cones to sundaes, to shakes, banana splits, ice cream cakes, to the trademark \"Blizzard\" with mix-ins, DQ is still the dominatrix of frozen dairy delight.   On this day I succumbed to the  call of the Blizzard , a thick soft-serve slurry of ice cream with mix-ins blended in, the obvious inspiration for McDonald's \"Flurry\", and I don't regret the indulgence (if I can now just keep my freshly requited passions under control). As I was mulling my choices the friendly counter help offered me a suggestion I hadn't noted on the menu, the combination known as \"the cookie jar\", a blend of cookie dough and crushed Oreo. I think I love you.   I decided to sit and savor and watch the insane 5 o'clock traffic on West Camelback go by. A family of 3 were the only other customers enjoying the cool of the smallish seating area, though there appeared to be steady business at the drive-thru. I suffered a moment of banana envy as they brought those picture-perfect banana splits to their table: three smooth, gleaming rounded minarets of vanilla, complete with the DQ curl on top, each topped with the venerable toppings of my memory from  DQ back home: strawberry, chocolate syrup , and the third  perhaps pineapple. (I'll finish page 2 of that sentence another time.)  This is a small, older DQ, set close to the road  on a moderately drab section of West Camelback, just off the 17 that undoubtedly was widened to take up a good bit of space out front.  The walk-up counter is small and your field of vision is crowded with menus and color posters and pictures of most every cold comfort you've ever known and probably more, including a bright-colored free-standing sign announcing that DQ now serves Orange Julius smoothies.  The dining area is small, but not cramped, a tad worn-looking but clean. Every table is spotless and there's no trash on the floor.  Both young women working the counter and drive-thru were pleasant, offered genuine smiles,  were courteous, competent on the register,  and quick on service. A return trip will be required to report on the restroom. That's my ticket anyway."}
{"text":"I'd only previously been to the drive-through at this little oasis of the desert - it maybe that's dessert in this instance. Service has always been amiable and adequate,  and the product consistent with the quality of DQ dairy treats I've enjoyed since childhood.   On this  my first foray into the interior, the staff takes a minute to appear but I'm still trying to take in the full menu so I'm not let waiting. Staff is friendly and efficient and my order ready no time.   The interior is wonderfully cool and the small dining area clean if not totally neat. There's a single napkin  on the floor under one booth and a couple unswept crumbs within sight but overall the impression is clean. I like the  DQ timeline and b&w pics on the wall. I note none of the unpleasant odors cited by others but do note this DQ has the full burger and fries menu and that mushroom & swiss is on my mind for a future occasion . Quite satisfied with my experience and purchase ."}
{"text":"Yay!  Closest one that was open since the Greentree location on Noble Roman's was closed.  The entry and exit are a tad precarious, but well worth the Dairy Queen goodness.  If you aren't familiar with the area, make certain you bring your GPS or you will get lost.    Good service and great ice cream."}
{"text":"awhhh.. orange Julius was too liquidy! not enough ice cream!    the bathroom doesn't have toilet seat covers.    you need a key to access them.. btw.                   cashier wasn't the friendliest. but the store was clean and organizrd behind the counter."}
{"text":"Ordered a birthday ice cream cake online and they are awesome. I had to call back each day , three times because I forgot to change the color of the frosting and then I forgot to make it an Oreo cake and then I forgot to change the time of pick up. But they were so patient and friendly and everything turned out perfectly and so happy they are my local Dairy Queen. Never got the name of the lady who works the mornings but she is super! Thank u DQ!!"}
{"text":"A hidden treasure...I love this spot! I'm pretty obsessed with place and their Strawberry Shortcakes!!! I'm drooling now just thinking about it! Services is pretty good. My family and I have been going at least once a week this summer! We all have our favorites and we always leave happy!!!"}
{"text":"We chose to drive through the DQ on our way home for a tasty treat. Well, with the size of vehicles in front of us, our vehicle was about 10 feet back from where the intercom was to order. However, the DQ employee took us for idiots. We just didn't want to yell. \"Sir, we can't hear you\" the guy says to us! So this frustrated us. They didn't say sorry even when we got to the window and tried to explain, she looked at us dumbfounded. I never ever expect 5 star (yelp 5 star) service from these franchises that employ high school students for minimum wage. So as I write this, I know I will be back one day, but I would hope I can give you guys a better rating because the employees will be more cheerful and understanding. One could hope, but I do love my strawberry chocolate dip blizzard!! So slap a smile on your face for $$$ you are earning, cause the happy customers will come back and you'll get good reviews. Oh and my blizzard was definitely not the frozen treat you can turn up side down, she didn't even do it, we were given our blizzards in a paper bag... Yeah, I know AZ weather sucks..."}
{"text":"Two medium blizzards ordered. Butterfinger still in freezer, have no idea if there is sufficient candy in it. Peanut butter blizzard had VERY LITTLE candy (not 3 scoops).  Went back to restaurant drive-thru.  Ann (Manager on duty) accused me of eating the candy.  I presented the blizzard and receipt.  Over 2/3rds of the ice cream was still in the cup.  Ann preceded to be nasty, accusing and not helping at all.  I then asked for a complete refund, Ann stated she could not do that.  I said I wasn't leaving the drive-thru until I got a refund.  Ann preceded to threaten me and saying she would call the police.  I said a replacement was fine. I will not be eating this because I have no idea if Ann and her co-workers did anything to it. So sad that you need to worry about something like this, she wouldn't give me a refund. Ann was absolutely horrible at customer service and threatened to call the police again.  I called the international headquarters when I got home and filed a report.  I will be posting this on social media, especially Facebook like the receipt says and whatever other means of letting the public in Las Vegas know about this particular location. Per Ann, I would like \"PAT\"  the store owner to call me concerning this horrible incident.  Ann deserves to be FIRED because of her inability and lack of knowledge on how to perform damage control in customer service . This location apparently has RATS as seen in the photo attached.  The black box is on the left as you go through the drive-thru. Gross! I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was good. We got 4 dipped cones and the mediums are quite big! They were quick as we were in the drive through. Good place for a quick snack."}
{"text":"This dairy queen is always clean and they have a good  2 for 1 special every day. Mondays is the Oreo Brownie Earthquake which is yum. I normally get a chocolate cone or blizzard and it is always good. They are really patient with my 5 year old as he likes to order and pay on his own:)"}
{"text":"My son and I come here for the occasional burger-and-fries combo, but mostly for the ice cream sundaes, the Blizzards, and ice cream cakes for special occasions. The place is generally clean, although the washroom could use a bit of a facelift because it looks run down."}
{"text":"Not having had anything since breakfast, I decided to have a Dairy Queen blizzard in lieu of \"real\" food.  I stopped at this newer outlet as it was on my way to the area of town I was going.  I ordered the blizzard and had a seat at one of the high top tables there.  In a short time, a young man brought me the blizzard and turned it upside down to show it was a good solid cup of ice cream with the fixings.  If anything drops out, the next blizzard is free.  I enjoyed the caloric rich soft ice cream mixed with salted caramel and chocolate truffle candy pieces that had been blended with the vanilla ice cream.  The place was clean."}
{"text":"How can you screw up soft serve ice cream? Only by scolding a customer when asking for another dip of chocolate since it was literally SEE THRU over the vanilla ice cream cone. I politely asked if I could get another layer or dip (didn't know the lingo) and the middle aged mad scoffed at me \"ma'am, that's the best the machine is going to do- I just changed the chocolate\". Why was I scolded? I said, keep your cone and prepared to walk out and be quickly back peddled and said \"I will get you whatever you want\". No thank you. I said, let's go kids! The rudest man who takes his job way to seriously. Who treats people like that over a $3 cone in front of my kids and his staff? Clearly explains the 2 Star rating which is such a shame for a neighborhood shop catering to locals. Again, it looked NOTHING like the photos. The chocolate was so thinly layered it was see through. Customer service 101. His responsive should have been, \"ABSOLUTELY followed by \"have a great day and thank you for choosing us\"! What a dip who knows nothing about how to dip. I left him holding my paid for ice cream and left empty handed. This was on Wednesday, I believe......"}
{"text":"I typically love this company. However, I have never dealt with more rude customer service. They regularly close early and get upset when paying customers try to order within an hour of closing. Not to mention, they never put fudge on items that call for it and deny customers items listed on their board because they claim that they don't carry them. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I stopped for a pumpkin pie blizzard on the way home as I had a need for some dessert.  It was 45 minutes from closing and the store was empty.  A pleasant woman took my order and said it would be ready in a short time.  She went behind the counter to the cooking area and I had a seat while she was making the blizzard.  Before she was done, I got up and walked to the counter and she came around and held the blizzard upside down to show the thickness of the mix.  The pumpkin pie blizzard is a mixture of pumpkin pie pieces and vanilla soft serve and topped with whipped cream and some nutmeg.  The concoction is quite good.  The pieces of pumpkin pie give the blizzard a nice texture.    This was a good stop for a treat but it's not something to do often.  I can just imagine the carbohydrate and calorie count but it was good.  Maybe one more time before the pumpkin flavor departs for another year."}
{"text":"I drive by this location often going to and from plays at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.  I always see their Blizzard of the Month and I have never had one.  I'm always on my way home and it's on the wrong side of Spring Mountain Road.  OK, I had extra time the other night and I had a strong desire to get some ice cream on the 100 degree day.  Problem solved.  Traffic was lighter than normal and I was able to make the south turn into the DQ , parked, and went inside.  The store is a bit old and somewhat rundown, but it was clean and there weren't many people there.  I looked at the Blizzard board for quite awhile and decided to go with the Blizzard of the Month--Confetti cake.  That's white cake pieces and confetti frosting blended with vanilla soft serve.  It was OK.  I should have stood firm with something peanut butter, but hey, when you're Blizzard of the Month, I guess you have to be good.  I may stop here again but I'll order with more care.  The staff was very pleasant and let me take all the time I wanted to decide.  Good service."}
{"text":"Queue \"Glory Days\" by the Boss.  Yes, back in high school I was killing it behind the counter of my local DQ.  Things were simpler back then...we made dilly bars and fudge nut bars (do they even have those anymore?) in house and we were happy about our \"brazier\" moniker.  Now, the term \"grill and chill\" is all the rage and you can order a orange julius to go along with your dairy treats.  What hasn't changed is my lust for blizzards.  Not every day/week or month but on a warm summer night when I throw my diet out the window, the blizzard works everytime.  The staff is pleasant at this location and drive-thru is efficient.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Dairy queen makes great ice cream, a nice place to hang out with my friends, and always nice and clean."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this Dairy Queen and will continue to pass along to the public the horrible service I received 4 times. After discussing issues with a manager and her being completely incompetent this restaurant needs help. I feel bad for your future customers and will steer people away from going here.   -Cold Food  -Wrong Items  -Workers using profanity in the back -Unsanitary  -Unprofessionalism -Poor Management"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place 0 stars. First time here they were out of any food including chicken. Second time they were out of icecream. You read that right. DQ was out of icecream. Now my third attempt at this place and the only food item they carry is hot dogs because, \"The owner never orders anything.\" Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow!!  They looked confused. 30 minutes for a small cone and small Oreo blizzard."}
{"text":"Shit is food I've ever eaten customer service is worse than a fucking McDonald's it took them 30 minutes to make my ice cream cone I will never go back to this restaurant they literally told my black friend to get the fuck out of the store because he's a dirty filthy Nager and me and my Niggas don't fuck like that we bang harder than the fucking 12 paying"}
{"text":"Good clean resturant with lots of menu choices. my food was prepared fresh as always and was overall very good. its also in a great location and has a great friendly staff."}
{"text":"The staff here is great! They are so friendly & keep the place super clean. The cakes here are so creative too!"}
{"text":"Extremely unfriendly service. Extremely slow service even though,  we were the only customers..chairs flipped over an hour before the dining room closed. Employees laughing and cussing, while not working. unprofessional, rude employees. Chucked food at table, we said Thank you and employee said \"phsst yeah\". dirty floors.  Several visits to this location, always the same crappy service."}
{"text":"Poor service. Long wait for food especially when it's dead inside the store.  No reason to take 10-15 minutes to make food."}
{"text":"I like this place. The workers are always friendly. My food and blizzard came out right away, it wasn't a long wait at all. Overall, just a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Reese's chunks in every bite of my large blizzard. 'nuff said. Great work guys!  But, since Yelp wants me to say more so that this is actually a review, I will, since this place is deserving. Conveniently located next to the LDS Mesa Temple for all your youth baptismal after-temple treats, date nights, and when you just gotta satisfy that sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Considering the lack of fast food along this stretch of road, this place is open! I have had both good and bad here. I always get the chicken strips. It really depends on the time of day as to if they are fresh and hot. 1030 am, they are fresh! I have never witnessed kids working the drive thru, always mature adults. I am sorry previous Yelpers have not had a good experience, but it has not been bad the last 5 or so times I have been here. I will continue to come back! I did not give a 5 star because sometimes my chicken is not always hot and fresh, but still good."}
{"text":"The lobby is packed and the service is still fast and friendly! Love the staff here and the location, they do truly great work. Fairly clean and conveniently located, hot food is hot and ice cream is perfect! Thanks for all you do!"}
{"text":"The lady in drive thru was very rude...she rushed thru the intercom order...rolled her eyes when she gave a chocolate dipped and it was supposed to be cherry. 3 slushies..more water then slushy. Very dissapointed at the lack of professionalism from this person and the quality of the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Since I have been dying sick all week with a cold/cough/sore throat I have been seeking out cold drinks and with kids in tow this was a special treat.  Orange Julius and Pineapple Julius are both winners here. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Would have no idea how to rate the ice cream, as after my third trip in, I was unable to make purchase. First time I popped in was 7:30ish on a Wednesday.  Only behind one customer ordering a party cake for Saturday.  Wow, the gal (albeit) nice, was confused by his order.  When he should pick up, when to pay.  So after several minutes I left.  Then, last Saturday, got into drive thru line.  Wait in line, turn corner as we move up, only to see sign that says they are out of choc. ice cream.  Considering I was planning on a half and half cone.  So, pulled out of drive thru line, like the 2 cars ahead.  Here we are today, April 21 to try again.  Absolute confusion inside from every staff member.  Again, after a wait I finally step up to order.  No chocolate ice cream.  I was told they never have it, only vanilla??????  It was really difficult to understand the server also.  I did not see any cleanliness level either.  Place is very old and stale inside.  The inside seats 4 tables.  After this review I plan on reaching out to a main corporate type office for DQ.  This is in a very trendy spot, across from Shake Shack and Dutch Bros. Coffee and other eateries.  They need to step up their game in this area of approximately 12 casual eateries.  Two ice cream places within a block are like $8 for an ice cream.  DQ offers a typical affordable choice for soft serve machine produced ice cream.  Would no recommend, will not return."}
{"text":"Come here often with my family of 6, usually once a week. We fill up the blizzard cards quickly! Lol The service is always friendly and one time I left my wallet there with almost 300 cash in it, figured out where I'd left it and picked it up the next day and not a dollar was missing. Thank you for your honest employees and excellent service!"}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment...even tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and come a few other times but was still disappointed. Melted ice cream or not mixed well...food is NOT grilled more like it was microwaved and bun was disgusting...I could get better buns for $1.00 at Walmart. Dirty/sticky tables/seats and no napkins. Owners are rude and seem to not put any effort in their business when they there..and they depend on the kids working there to pull the weight/stress of rush hour and unhappy customers.They will NOT be getting my business again!"}
{"text":"Easily the most ratchet DQ I've ever been to. Come in 20 minutes before closing for a couple of blizzards which is really all they're known for. It took 10 minutes for me to even be acknowledged while some former employee snap chatted himself the whole time being like \"um guys aren't you going to acknowledge your customer\" (meaning me). The guy was nice enough when he came around and the order was correct but considering there were no other customers in line or in the drive through, I was more than a little surprised. Last resort DQ when the craving hits."}
{"text":"All the workers are so nice and welcoming. They walk out blizzards and food out to us, make us feel like family. The petite girl with curly hair, who took our order is soooo sweet. There's nothing like getting a blizzard unless it's getting a blizzard with a smile. And everyone has great smiles here!! So happy with my service!! I will come here again!!!!!!!!! Yayyyyyyyy blizzards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Picking up a pre called in cake for a life celebration party and decided to have dessert before lunch. We got to the store a little early since we thought opened at 10 am, but it is really 10:30 am. The staff shooed is out for about 15 minutes but I totally understand since we're so early. Besides the cake pick up I had a small strawberry sundae with whip and nuts. My son had a small hot fudge sundae extra fudge. There ice cream always takes me back to my childhood too. The service was great even brought them to our table, such a sweet place to enjoy more now that it's going to break 100 mark."}
{"text":"So today I go into diary queen with my buy one get one coupon and the cashier like oh we don't except coupons, oh really? Worse customer service ever she was so rude. I guess its cause I was black. #NeverAgain"}
{"text":"I'd have to just say this dairy queen is average.  Among all the ones in town that I've been to, they usually are about the same. Super busy and staff always seem overwhelmed.  This one was packed with all the seats being taken. The table we sat at was dirty with ice cream and napkins and the staff was not cleaning any of the tables.  Understandable in a rush, but don't visibly eat ice cream after a rush in the back instead of cleaning tables first =\  Anyways this place was just below average for me.."}
{"text":"This has probably been the worst experience I've ever had in any fast food drive thru. He couldn't hear and I could hear him trying to take someone else's order inside because he left the headset on. Then he gets upset with me saying \"come on, I need to get this order done\" when he is the one that was making this order difficult. I continuously had to repeat my order. Something needs to be done about the service at this location."}
{"text":"My grandfather tall bald guy went to order us 3 burgers he had to wait 20 min for 3 burgers there was noone else ordering food before or after he ordered food , he had to wait almost 30 min at about 20 min of waiting he said whats taking so long there was 3 people working and it takes 30 min my grandfather asked whats taking so long and the guy told him its only be 18 min how rude , then the guy took the burgers out of the fucking microwave not grilled but microwaved burgers what the fuck how does a food establishment microwave burgers , how pittyful this establishment is shit i was a first time customer what a aweful experience they deserved to be fired scum workers who takes 30 min to microwave a burger never will come back"}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to give only one star, but I'm fighting off a wretched cold and the Grape Arctic Freeze I got soothed my poor throat. So kudos for that.  Everything else.  No.  While ordering the girl who was taking our order was seriously lacking in any basic form of customer service. While my fiancé was ordering she Rudely stopped him mid sentence and snapped \"I can't hear you, you need to speak up when ordering.\"  I'm sorry, what?  I'm so sorry I'm having trouble hearing you, could you repeat that one more time for me? This is an acceptable response for future reference.  Then we pull up to pay and she has us pull up to the front because chicken takes longer to prepare. Ok I get it but it shouldn't take ten minutes after we pay.  Then to top it all of we get home and the sauce for my chicken strips is no where to be seen.  *sigh*  Curse my sore throat and my weakness for Grape Arctic Freezes. I will not be tempted again!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this location. Took my 76 year old mother in law and my 13 year old son into get ice cream. The juvenile behavior of the staff was unbelievable. When I told then they were not being professional and their actions were inappropriate, I was threatened holding harm by the associate name Logan.. the manager care out and continued the juvenile behavior. Completely unbelievable the way the employees were acting. We left without our food or a refund. WILL NEVER RETURN."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Diary Queen I have ever been to. Most are very cheap on the amount of stuff they put in their Blizzards... Not this place! I stopped going to DQ because their Blizzards have so little stuff in them I'd rather go to another place. But this place has redeemed DQ in my eyes :)"}
{"text":"Yough staple....one of my favorite ice cream spots. They have a drive-thru or you can order at the window. They also serve food at this location, too. Like most other locations, it obviously can get very crowded, especially in the evenings. If I stop here, I usually order at the drive-thru, then park across the street by Bruno Field to enjoy my spoils!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen closed 20 minutes earlier than listed on the door and on yelp. I arrived at 10:10 and the doors were locked and lights were off... What the heck! I got my hopes up for Diary Queen and am very disappointed..."}
{"text":"This was the worst dairy I have been to in my life. The grilled chicken salad was wilted, brown with unedible tomatoes and very little chicken and not tasty. My partner's turkey sandwich was average at best. the fries were good."}
{"text":"It's an older dq, kinda dirty, employees seem preoccupied, but I am able to get my ice cream fix so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Closed on free cone day?  Due to ice cream machine not working. Boo. Shame on you.  Cheap owner. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"I love the brand new DQ! Great location, service, and everything you know and love about Dairy Queen :) Nom Nom Nom"}
{"text":"I very much regret coming to the DQ to satisfy my late night craving for some sugary dessert........  Came on Saturday night and the place was pretty much empty, should have taken it as the sign to leave because the food was absolutely awful.   We ordered a Cookie Dough Blizzard, Chocolate Dipped Cone, and Fudge Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookie. Well let me tell you, with the exception of the Cone, the other items did not look appetizing at all and greatly deviated from the advertised picture on the menu. The Blizzard looked like a pile of goo and didn't taste was good as McDonald's McFlurry, which is what I usually get, and I think it's pricier as well.   However, the Cookie with Ice Cream took the cake being most nasty dessert I've had in a while. At a price point of $5.99 I was expecting something like a restaurant grade dessert, or at least it should stay true to the picture. But nope, what was handed to me was a plate of abomination. I watched as the guy was preparing the cookie. It was pretty much reheated from frozen and there was only 1 cookie. I have no idea how they determined the price of this thing, like how is 1 cookie, some ice cream, and some chocolate sauce worth $5.99. The ice cream was even smaller than what you could get from a cone as well. The taste was atrocious as well, too sweet, the ice cream wasn't very good (creamy texture, but not very creamy flavour), and for the cookie I swear I can bake something that tastes a lot better.    Definitely would not visit DQ again, for this location at least, over-priced and sub-standard ice creams."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before stopping with my kids. The two young girls working were very pleasant event though it was one of their 2nd days. The older lady who ended up helping was horrible. I ordered a small blizzard for my 2 year old and didn't realized that I needed a mini. The sizes were not clearly marked and the woman didn't care. This is the first and last time I will be here."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, restaurant was clean, and the service was speedy. Definitely reccomend this location."}
{"text":"Do me a favor, don't bs me to my face or next time I'm going to raise hell. You tell me there's no cheesecake? Lol really? Lets be real, You didnt wanna go to the back and get it because youre lazy. Went by fast. 3 people working so it went quick. Only positive"}
{"text":"*Please note this review is for burger and fries not ice cream*  Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, on with the review. I remember was I was really young it was a treat when my parents took us to Dairy Queen.  We'd get a burger or hot dog and then ice cream.  It was awesome in my memories.  I had not been back in years, probably should have just kept with the memories because the place did not live up to them. flamethrower Grillburger sounds like it should be amazing, yet turned out to be a bland and somewhat dry burger... and the fries were completely forgettable.  Next time I'll stick to ice cream."}
{"text":"food here was not very good at all, my burger didn't taste good, like it was reheated in a microwave. this place was no bueno"}
{"text":"Called in advance before having my family drive over to this location to get the cotton candy blizzard. I called a hour before my family got there and confirmed they had the cotton candy flavor. My family gets there to get the blizzards and now they don't have the blizzards. They gave us 30% off but acted like it wasn't their fault and that we didn't really call today: If you are out of a flavor you should give a customer a heads up since other locations don't have it. 3rd Dairy Queen in this town to provide poor customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in today very friendly service. Men's restroom was spotless. The food came out fast and hot very pleased with the whole experience. I will you back if I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"I am so glad they remodeled this place.  It was getting a bit run down, but is a staple as one of the only dairy queens in the central Phoenix Area.   The service is good and the ice cream always hits the spot.  Yesterday we went through the drive-thru and had to wait a bit, but once the window a Hispanic man in his early 20s handed us our amazing shakes and was so friendly.  He was overly kind and made me wish I had gotten his name as we drove away."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 1:45 today and it was not busy at all.(only 2 cars in the drive through. I waited fifteen minutes after I placed my order just to reach the window. The person on the mic said she would have my total at the window. I didn't think anything of it as I only ordered two chicken wraps and a fry. My total was $10.52. For two freakin wraps and a fry! This used to be on the 5 buck lunch menu! To add to the already bad experience they filled the cup with 3/4 ice and didn't put any condiments in the bag. Pretty disappointing from a restaurant that used to be so good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fast food experiences I've had in a long time,  the staff working tonight, all of them, we're really friendly and helpful even when I felt annoying asking some questions about special orders or adding things the cashier never seemed annoyed by me. We got food and ice cream and both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst DQ I've ever been into in my life. Will drive the extra miles to go buy from the one on rainbow"}
{"text":"I can't believe im writing a review of Dairy Queen but this is by far the nicest one I have ever been to. You give them your order and they bring the ice cream out to you. They also do this fun flippy thing with the blizzards at the table."}
{"text":"Really, no reviews yet???  This DQ is a staple of Lakewood's heritage. It's always staffed by high school aged girls, and has the tiniest width drive thru in the world.  But it's standards are up to par as a chain. The staff is friendly and fast, the product consistent and good. If you're just not in the mood to spend $20 on ice cream at Malley's, then this is a great stop on a summer day."}
{"text":"Wife and I came in tonght for a couple of Medium sized Blizzards. Fanasitc quick service! We are very please who awesome everyon was. Thanks!"}
{"text":"No review necessary.  Everyone already knows.  Maybe the new place can give some competition.  The DQ in Savoy and N Mattis are better options."}
{"text":"DQ is DQ..... what else can be said.  All I wanted was a dip cone.  I got my dip cone in a timely manner.  The place was clean, the employees were nice.  I was happy with my cone, but after all..... it is still just a DQ."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Ice cream is the best soft serve ever. Smoothies are great, blizzards are also great. Does seem a bit expensive for ice cream but I guess it's the quality you're paying for."}
{"text":"Not expecting much... But you've got to love when there's 3 teens behind the counter, the place is virtually empty, and none can think about giving the tables a quick wipe down. A basic hygiene thing... No wonder the place is slowly dying."}
{"text":"Came in here with a group of ten. The order was wrong and when we went to tell them they gave us a cone and not a coke they didn't offer the cost difference back to us. When we told the manager Austin that they missed one of the kids sundaes he said \"we gave you two you need to give one back to us\". We told him we needed another and he was rude back and told us to stop yelling \"which we were not!\" My husband told him he shouldn't be talking to his customers that way and he said \"excuse me, would you like me to call the cops?\". Where did this manager Austin go so crazy on us. The poor two ladies behind the counter apologized to us and even offered another sundae. Even his own employees were embarrassed. Too bad such a good ice cream place would have such poor management."}
{"text":"I love ice cream, plain and simple! We came to this particular location because we had a coupon for a buy one get one free blizzard. When we arrived the place was not very busy, we places our order, found a seat and waited for our ice cream yumminess to  arrive. I ordered the banana split Blizzard. Yum! It was already a little melty by the time it got to me, but who cares as I dug right in!  This location is right off the freeway, next to a hospital, it os clean and bright, and the staff is friendly. We will definitely be back for an ice cream treat, especially now since the weather is warming up!"}
{"text":"I like the blizzards and the peanut buster parfaits. Tonight I swung through the drive through for a small blizzard treat. After staring at the menu I decided on the turtle pecan blizzard. It was super yummy. I thought the service was slow, but the ice cream is good."}
{"text":"They don't have chocolate ice cream here which is a major fail. And no dipping in chocolate is not the same thing. Other than that it was your typical dq. Good location to take a load off and look out the window at goings on."}
{"text":"Cold ice cream but portions always seem a little small. You gotta love dq tho. It's my fave."}
{"text":"When you go to The Queen, you pretty much know what you are going to get.   I've always had good service. Sometimes, there is a bit of a struggle bus situation, but overall, very positive.  The most amazing thing happened to me one time at this particular location. The registers were down, so they literally were just giving away free ice cream. It was the first time I didn't have to feel guilty for making a special trip to buy the $9 box of Dilly Bars. Heck Yes!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. My husband and I both got the strawberry sundae. Brought them home to find my husbands only had one little strawberry and mine had none.  For the price we paid, both were $9 plus change, I would expect a strawberry sundae to have strawberries and not what seemed to be strawberry syrup. We got the large but it was more like a medium. Will not be returning. On the plus side the employees were very nice."}
{"text":"Not being an avid Dairy Queen diner, I didn't really know what to expect. The last time I ate food (not ice cream) from Dairy Queen I recalled being disappointed so I went in with a bit of skepticism. Regardless, I thought I would give them a try tonight just to have something different.   I wasn't sure what to order but a burger was sounding good so I went with a combo number 2. That is a double burger with bacon, pepper jack cheese and spicy sauce. I have to say, I was not disappointed. It was big, fresh, juicy and pleasent tasting. It had just enough spice to make my mouth tingle amd my nose run. The bacon was a little more chewy than crunchy which is fine at breakfast but makes it difficult to eat in a burger. And half the bottom bun was soggy by the time I got home. Aside from that, this was a good burger.  The fries were piping hot hot when my bag was passed through the window. I think I burned my fingers a little. They were good fries. Not my favorite but good. Hot. Crisp. Salted just enough.   I had a touch of sticker shock when I saw the menu and heard my final price. Over $10 for this meal. For fast food that is just too much. I've complained about that before in regards to other places. When I can go to a casual dining place and get an equal or better burger for the same or lower, I take issue with that. I also take issue when fast food isn't so fast. I sat long just enough tonight to start getting irritated. The freshness of the food makes up for that. I would rather wait 5 minutes for a good burger than receive a crap burger in 30 seconds.  So am I a fan of DQ? I don't know that I would say that just yet. But its good to know I have another place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Dairy Queen.  Some locations have a different menu than others.  Some offer a full food menu.  Others seem to offer mostly ice cream.  This particular Dairy Queen offers a bit of both but tend towards the ice cream side of things.  I'm not much of an ice cream person so I don't come to Dairy Queen for that and there food is just average.  I can find similar food with better quality at other places.  What brought me in the other day was a coupon I got in the mail.  Half off any size Orange Julius.  I can remember liking on Orange Julius at the mall when I was a kid so with my coupon I ordered a medium and paid $2.05.  It was as I remember.  Frothy, cold and sweet.  It was a nice treat on a rather warm Sunday afternoon.  As simple as an Orange Julius is to make it should not have taken as long as it did for me to walk in, order, pay, receive and leave.  But the staff was all in the back of the place.  The girl back there kept looking at me and saying nothing.  Finally she did acknowledge me and send up a guy to take the order.  He then showed her how to make an Orange Julius.  I get the impression she was new there.  Fair enough but somebody should teach her to acknowledge the customer quicker."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for almost 10 years. I was very close to the previous owners and watched their 2 sons literally grow up in that store. I haven't seen them in a while and I decided to check out how their store was doing on yelp. I've been using yelp for the longest time but never created an account until now because I saw some pretty recent negative reviews, which came as a complete shock to me because I knew the owners so well. Anyways, I came in @ 9:30 pm today and noticed a line of 3 people. I didn't know they were supposed to close up already. There was a young man who I did not recognize. Despite that fact that I and 2 other people were holding the store open past their closing time, He still took my order, treated me as any other customer and I didn't even feel as if he was in a rush, I was able to get a few words in with him and I was told they recently changed owners. I guess that explains the bad reviews.  I always order a Medium Turtle Pecan Cluster Blizzard, which is to die for!!! Along with that I always get a large Orange Julius and their Iron Grilled Sandwiches. They're getting 5 starts because of their products, how quick my food was ready and how I was treated that night. I tipped him a 5 and he was super appreciative. I'd recommend this location to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"The loooooooongest wait for my order ever. Do not come here unless you have a half and hour to wait for your order."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is all about the ice cream on a hot AZ day. Friendly service, tasty sundae and blizzard."}
{"text":"Have been really disappointed the last few times we went. We were supposed to get buy one blizzard get the second one for .99 and they rang it up wrong and were very confused so I just said forget about it. Then we went as a family through the long drive thru line last night and waited about 15 minutes for them to tell us their ice cream machines were down. Total bummer, thankfully sonic is just down the street!"}
{"text":"March 8th 2017, I pull into the drive thru with 1 car in front of me at 12:40.  I didn't get to the window until 1:12!  Over a 30 minute wait!!!  I asked the worker why I just waited over 30 minutes in the drive through and she explained the manager just left and they were short staffed and couldn't handle the order before me.  THE MANAGER LEFT at 12:30pm!! In the middle of the lunch rush! Unbelievable.  If you are the manager of this location I would love to talk to you pronto."}
{"text":"Stay away from this DQ! Find another one near by. The owners are extremely rude, don't care about customer service and you do not get what you pay for. People in town echo my sentiments, they have nothing but negative things to say about this place and the owners. I've given them several chances and I just give up and will not go back. They skimp on what you order, they don't prepare it right and just get an attitude and angry when you question your order.......Friends of mine said the owners live in their neighborhood and they are a nightmare and a disturbance to the subdivision. I can see this with how they behave in their own restaurant. I will not be rewarding them by giving them my repeat business!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more disgusted by the fact that I found an acrylic finger nail in my blizzard. This is absolutely disgusting. Please see my photo."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Dairy Queen? This location is clean, modern & run by teenagers, so what can you expect but a few minutes waiting on them to pull their head out of their butt long enough to provide a semblance of customer service."}
{"text":"Very fast service; one really kind worker. Without even realizing it until the next time I came, on my last visit the worker upgraded my cup without me knowing it! I had ordered a small, but he made it a medium. Completely thoughtful. I am so thankful for it. Come to this place to satisfy your sweet craving!"}
{"text":"We have always loved DQ blizzards.... kids are always satisfied, but we always ask for extra candy the blizzards for my wife and I, we get charged for extra candy, then by the time we are halfway thru them there is no candy. I even ask for pb sauce in mine, and never get it. Always teens working, no adult or even college age managers on duty. It must be nice being the closest DQ and knowing no one will drive out of there way to visit the other locations to get what they pay and ask for. Whoever this franchise owner is, they should really look deeply into their staffing. I would say we visit this location at least once a week, but I think its time to go elsewhere....  Its a shame that with how busy this place is, that they take advantage of their customer base."}
{"text":"Some restaurants are plain, but the people make the trip worth it. This DQ is one of those places. They are lucky to have Kendrick working up front. This young gentleman has an awesome attitude and he makes a big difference.  The food is your typical fast food fare. I add a patty to my burgers to get a proper beef to bun ratio. The fried cheese curds are a fun treat that is hard to come by in Vegas.   The blizzards here are always cold and I love how they follow protocol and flip them upside down before giving them to you."}
{"text":"This is the DQ the hubs and I roll through. There is one much closer to our house, but it doesn't have a drive through, and generally when i want DQ I am already in my PJ's and not looking so presentable.   So we drive a tiny bit further for the luxury of staying in the car.   So, we roll through last week. They were busy, but the line moved fast. We get to the window and the girl is all out of sorts and mumbling stuff we don't know what she is saying. She goes to get our ice cream and almost gets into a fight with one of her fellow coworkers. She comes back to the window and looks all sorts of stabby. We get our blizzards and split!   The ice cream is always good. They have messed up our order a few times, and the people that work there generally scare me. But I love ice cream and will get my fix any way I can"}
{"text":"If I could give this Dairy Queen 0 stars, I would. I grew up near this Dairy Queen and for years it was great. Not anymore. Don't bother.  First off, the place is disgusting. Dirty and nasty inside. Husband wanted to stop and grab a cone. Took over 20 minutes in the drive thru for one twist cone. And we were the only ones there. Please save yourself. Go somewhere else. Management here needs to make some changes."}
{"text":"American Dairy Queen is an ICE Cream Shop, which has been providing consumers with crave-satisfying treats and food since 1940. It has served ice cream & signature shakes top the menu at this classic burger & fries fast-food chain. It has many locations across Canada. The location My boyfriend and I always came for ICECReam desserts after the dinner, was closer to our place. It's located on McKenzie Towne Community. It's a nice convenient location for all the customers. Also, it has been very busy lately. Last time, we went there for ice cream. I had a small chocolate ice cream cone and my boyfriend ordered chocolate chip cookie dough blizzard treat. Both of them cost us around $8. The taste of ice creams was great.  Besides ice cream, Dairy Queen also serves hot dogs and burgers, which I haven't tried before. But, my boyfriend had great experiences with their chicken burgers. Hopefully, I will try them in the future."}
{"text":"How can u not give this place 5*'s cone on people. Can u say ice cream.....yummy So thy just open the girl wanted on us was very nice and pretty fast. We got a HOT fudge sundae and truffle blizzard. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Chicken strips were dry and old and French fries were half done will not return very disappointed"}
{"text":"Went to DQ tonight with giftcards I got for my birthday. Apparently their machine wouldn't take my giftcard but would take my credit card. This is the second time that I've had a problem with this place and it hasn't even been open for more than 2 weeks!"}
{"text":"I went into this location at 9pm tonight and they tell me the machines are down and no signs and people where cleaning up  since they close at 10 I hate when they lie just  so they don't have to clean the machines again don't have 10 pm as closing if you can't have machines run until then this is why your store will not last"}
{"text":"When we decided to live in Sun City West, we set our priorities up and being close to a good Dairy Queen was right near the top!  This place is just fine.  In the winter it can get pretty busy but they usually have enough staff.  If you like Blizzards and good shakes, you won't be disappointed.  Beats the pants off the lousy, overpriced Arbys down the street. Gary"}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen here. I always get a large blizzard whether it be the chocolate extreme or the M&M blizzard. Plus the milkshakes are great too."}
{"text":"This is the grosses place ever. I came here with my family and I am repulsed. The tables are so dirty, the floors are even worse! And the smell.. I can't even describe. I don't know how an owner/manager can let a place be so horrible."}
{"text":"I don't do sweets, but when i do. It's a cookie dough blizzard from Dairy Queen. It's not much to look at and on the tougher side of town, but that doesn't take away from the taste."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but my last experience kind of turned me off to this location.  I will go to the DQ at Gilbert and Juniper.    On my last visit here, I ordered a chocolate dipped waffle cone.  He tried to charge me for a regular cone and I knew because they price was off.  I tried to clarify in person that I didn't want a regular cone.  He charged me for the chocolate dipped cone and gave me a regular waffle cone.  I figured it wasn't worth arguing with him over it so I took the cone and left."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen location provides excellent customer service. The owner of this location and her staff do a magnificent job at making delicious blizzards and other items. I went there yesterday evening and the restaurant was very clean. They are all quite professional and supportive of the local community."}
{"text":"Visit 9/14/17 830pm Thought I would give DQ another try Nope was Disappointed again costumer service was horrible! Pulled up to drive thru window lady bought out the box of ice cream threw it in the air and caught the box then when she got to the counter she threw the box of Dilly Bars on the counter. I also bought an ice cone and cone had an old taste. Never again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Unfriendly staff and way overpriced. Managers have attitudes-will not return."}
{"text":"This is for the Orange Julius I ordered....  Yummy...brings back memories of my childhood and the mall. I'm positive there's a ton of sugar but it was delish regardless. 3 something dollars for a medium on a semi hot day made this Orange Julius hit the spot.     Cheese curds caught my eye...might have to try them next time even though I'm sure they are artery clogging cheese bites."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen definitely l aves a lot to be desired. I've lived down the street for a year now and been in multiple times. The owners are Indian, and they act like there's a language barrier when they understand perfectly. They are extremely rude! I hate that this is the only one in town because I don't want to contribute to such rude people. But when my kids want ice cream I don't want to drive 20 minutes to get it. Although I have, Sonics customer service and ice cream is very superior then this Dairy Queen.   The food is acceptable. But they always get something wrong. And God forbid you ask for something made different! The owner lady who is always at the register at the counter rolls her eyes all the time!"}
{"text":"Nice and cold inside and they have rainbow sprinkles really enjoyed my experience they have a few tables you can sit and rest in the cool. They also get the product right. Last time I tried to have DQ was at the chandler fashion and the ice cream was melted I had to ask for a refund. Maybe the machine was broken who knows. Point is this cone was great I'm very pleased sometimes simple things in life are the best like a vanilla ice cream cone with sprinkles on a hot summer day"}
{"text":"I have had DQ maybe a hundred times in my life probably more. And let's be honest as a kid ice cream was my favorite food. These days Mexican is my favorite. Today after my Mexican lunch I had a taste for ice cream and decided to try this location. We used to have one by my house but it closed.   I'm not sure why maybe I was just really wanting ice cream but it was just better. Did they make it right was the machine new did they have it set at the right temperature I don't know  I think it's just better at this location. The employees seem very nice and happy so maybe that helps they do the job properly.   Anyway job well done I'll be back to compare future visits to this visit"}
{"text":"Gotta love dairy queen  - glad this one has a drive through!"}
{"text":"For as long as I can remember, my family has bought DQ ice cream cakes for birthdays. That ooey gooey layer of crunchy chocolate and fudge with vanilla ice cream oddly hits the spot every time and always brings back memories.  Mom and I came in here recently looking for a birthday cake for my dad. Unfortunately, everything in the freezer was fairy princesses and unicorns, which obviously wasn't going to work for an adult man. Without being prompted, one of the employees asked if we needed help. We told her the dilemma and she offered to go \"check in the back.\"   The store was busy, and we thought she was just being polite and might not even come back, like most apathetic young employees in chains. Just as we were ready to hit the door, she returned with an age-appropriate cake she found in the back freezer. It was very sweet! She iced it for us quickly and we were pleasantly surprised by her helpfulness. We appreciated not having to run to a second Dairy Queen location!"}
{"text":"We go here at least once a month to take the kids to ice cream.  Thisctime was terrible.  The blizzards were so watery theyvwere like soup. They remade them and they were still terrible.  What happened to the upside down test? Shouldn't these have been free?"}
{"text":".Awful service and worse food.  Upon arriving I was asked if I was ready to order.  I replied I'll need a few seconds.  I waited close to the counter with money in hand waiting to order.  Once the girl taking orders saw me she moved to take my order but couldn't quit the conversation she was having with a coworker.  She left me standing there while she went back to the back multiple times.  When my food arrived for take out the blizzards were very runny.  Not only was it a liquid but there were no toppings and didn't make it past the rim of the cup.  I wish the blizzard was the worst part.  My cheeseburgers were cold and soaked all the way through soggy.  Chicken strips had clearly been sitting back there since the lunch hour.  When I got home and sat down to eat I realized the quality of the food.  When I called to inform the staff that I was not satisfied I was told I would need to drive the 20 min drive back to the store for a refund.   Will not go to this store again.  I have never left a one star on yelp before. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is absolutely top notch! We literally drive 20 minutes to go to only this location. There is one right down the street from our home but they refuse to fill our special requests. The evening shift staff is the reason that we keep coming back!! They are all so friendly, and they are always willing to make our favorite peanut butter crunch blizzard. If you've never had one go here and try one. They do an excellent job!"}
{"text":"Customer service is not practiced at this location. We frequently grab a cool treat at night and so far have yet to encounter a friendly, helpful or polite staff member. It really is a shame to taint the ice cream which happens to always be delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally!!!!  A Dairy Queen that serves cherry dipped cones!  I'm really not one for sweets, but my favorite thing in the world when it comes to sweets is a cherry dipped cone from DQ.  When I was ten I moved to Southern California.  For the life of me we couldn't find a DQ anywhere.  One day we found one at a mall.  I was so excited to finally have a cherry dipped cone, but when I ordered it the person working there look at me like I was making it up.    It was after that day I went on a crusade to find one around my town, and to no avail I could not.  It wasn't until I moved here that I have my favorite treat minutes from my house.  No more having to go to my hometown to get my beloved cherry dipped cone.  Thank you Dairy Queen on Tenaya."}
{"text":"Good product. Good staff  Happy customer.   Issues with a milk shake once. Little flavour"}
{"text":"I never had an issue with this place other than its a long drive to get here. :-/ The drive thru is usually quick, the ice cream is delicious and the service is as good as any fast food place I have ever been.   My favorite thing to order is a cherry cheesecake blizzard with extra cheesecake. It is delicious! I recently tried one of their new hot treats. They have added three different kinds: chocolate chip cookie a la mode, brownie a la mode, and apple crisp a la mode. I tried the apple crisp and it wasn't bad. The apple and cinnamon combo is one of my favorites! I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and the place is clean! I asked for add ons and the girl didn't even make me feel bad for it! Lol"}
{"text":"The ice cream is good and the cheeseburgers. What I really want to say is the manager Robert is a wonderful man. I was in the parking lot when a truck backed into my car causing damage. I forgot my cell and the truck guy would not let me use his phone to call the police because he had no proof of insurance. When I went to the Dairy Queen Robert helped me immediately. While I was calling the truck guy had left. Robert even had the recording of the entire accident which he gave to the police. He was so kind to me offering a drink or any thing to help. While there are bad people in the world there are good people like Robert.  I have to commend him for stepping up to help me when no one else would. Thank you so much Robert, I am very grateful."}
{"text":"It's late but just had to come get a treat. Went through drive through. Only s couple cars in front me me. Wasn't the fastest time but was OK. Ice cream was good. Kinda hard to mess it up I figured."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, seating areas available, Drive-Thru and great service.   We visit this location when we're looking to get a cold sweet fix."}
{"text":"Good service. I've yet to try any food, but the ice cream is great! The drive thru wait is decent, depends on what the person in front of me ordered. Can get very busy once the middle school lets out so I avoid that time."}
{"text":"Kids that work there are always nice.  They take coupons of all sorts and my kid likes it as a special treat.  With they had more blizzard options as the usual ones that I had through the 80s and 90s.  Maybe try say, oh.....Gravy flavored?  Ham flavored?  OH!...I got it!  Malt Liquor flavored!"}
{"text":"Received excellent service from Melissa with a last minute ice cream cake order. Friendly staff and the best ice cream!"}
{"text":"I am a pretty positive guy able to shake almost anything off. But after having a 25 minute wait, not getting all my food and then no response from the owner after complaining to corporate; this establishment WILL NOT receive one more dime of my money."}
{"text":"Not too many bad things to say about this location.  Every time I've gone I've gotten what I asked for.  It seems to be fairly clean; I've noticed nothing to make me think otherwise.  The service was fast and friendly so, yeah, no complaints really."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because I come here 5 nights a week.    The drive up is fast and they always have new things to try! The staff is great and friendly and you can't beat the price. Anything with the chocolate ice cream is going to be the thing to get :)"}
{"text":"I have had really good luck here. They have a great selection of sheet and round cakes at reasonable prices. The cakes are a big hit at the parties. I have also had a number of the blizzards and sundaes here. The service was fine, but could be a bit faster as I was standing there for a few minutes without getting my order in the past. The kids area with the TV is nice, but is distracts the kids from eating their ice cream. I have not tried any of their hot food so I am not sure what that is like. I will definitely be back to order cakes!"}
{"text":"I went for their version of just a fancy shake with candy in it. This has been named after a winter weather storm but it's a shake that takes a while to make. Ok so the girl goes through the process. I'm reading a sign they have for a free item if they don't turn the thing upside down for you. I'll go back if you need a picture. However when I asked why she didn't do this she said it might spill. The person before got his flipped upside down. I don't know why they waste people's time doing this and I'm glad I didn't have to go through it but where's my free item? It might spill isn't a good enough reason to deny me."}
{"text":"I don't wanna go 5-stars wild on this place, but I had an Orange Julius here for the first time in about 15 years and - goddamn - just as tasty as they always were! I didn't even know the chain existed anymore, so this find stoked me out."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm considered a regular here.  Service is lame to pathetic.  There is no customer service, it's more like a question and answer at the drive through.  Curt.  No explanations.  No apologies.   Nada.  This is what it costs and then the obnoxious and sarcastic \"Have a good night.\"  Ya know DQ, I could get a cheaper cone at McDonald's or even better, a frozen custard from Freddies.  And there is Rita's too.  So many more options -it's not just DQ.  Get your stuff together and teach your staff to get the job done and add a dose of common courtesy to the \"customer service.\""}
{"text":"This location holds up to the same ice cream quality as most Dairy Queens. I haven't had a bad experience at this location and the staff are pretty fast, with shorter wait times. I haven't experienced their drive thru but I always like going inside to get the full experience.  They always have a good selection of pre-made ready to go ice cream cakes so its nice to be able to drop in and grab one quickly.   Our kids love DQ Blizzards!   TIP #1: Waste of money getting a kids mini blizzard as its extremely tiny and costs almost the same as the small.   TIP #2: When ordering the cheesequake blizzards, ask them to blend less so you get more chunks. Otherwise, they always over blend and you won't get any cheesecake chunks. Our kids are always excited to eat the chunks."}
{"text":"Sandbagged burgers. Not necessary being the burgers are small for fast cooking. Asked for well done crispy fries.. comes out same regular. White guy who took our order couldn't even put a fresh patty down, don't know the difference from crispy and regular fries. Only came here cause my daughters choice. Definitely talking her out of this place next time..."}
{"text":"Good food, but horrible customer service. Waiting to order takes forever even though there are employees standing around. I was there once with my daughter while an employee was cursing and complaining about someone. Another employee dropped plastic ware on the ground in the customer area and just it there.  Suggestion, go through the drive through if you absolutely want to eat at a Dairy Queen, otherwise avoid this place."}
{"text":"After the girl taking her ass time putting everything together. \"Note to self check ur food before you drive off. \" missing food and I'm sure she's probably eating it. Your welcome"}
{"text":"My girls make me take them here at least once a week. Always have the nicest gentleman help us. Smiling, and great customer service."}
{"text":"Busy place on a hot day and the ice cream is so good. We went to this location yesterday afternoon. The drive thru was busy and there was a line inside too. Only four guys working so the service was slow and I mean really slow ( a star off for service). However the product saved the day. The Blizzard was awesome and the regular soft serve was smooth and creamy. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have brought my little girl here 2 times now, and have had awesome service. The young staff are super friendly and accommodating. The quality of ice cream and toppings is always perfect. Definitely recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mint chip Blizzard please and thank you. Maybe I should try something new? Nah."}
{"text":"The establishment is really nice but the two times I have gone the customer service has been horrible. Both times the orders have been mixed up and had to be replaced or changed. The food is always great DQ eats and treats but they need to pick up their customer service!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few blizzards to go for family. Pulled up to the window after waiting 5 minutes for the drive thru employee to do her job and take my order. Pulled up and saw the employees laughing it up with their weed smoke coming out the drive thru window. Employee takes my cash and forgets about my order altogether. Got his attention and got him to give me what I ordered. Apparently I ordered a milky soup with m and Ms in it. Why is it never actually frozen ice cream like the good old days?!?!?! It's always melted. Look just freeze it.... it's not that hard a concept. Then the blizzards had no lids. Asked for lids. Gave me the wrong lids. Lids for the sundaes are not Lids to the blizzards FYI employees. No bag for 3 blizzards and a banana split. No Lids. No spoons or napkins. And he want a $15 an hour minimum wage. Get the f outta here dairy Queen."}
{"text":"I had not been to this location since they remodeled the inside it's really clean and nice... Friendly staff I was impressed. I ordered the chicken finger basket it comes with fries and two pieces of toast... For the sauces I went with the honey mustard and the gravy... I rate the food as followed. Chicken Fingers - B Fries - B Toast - D  Gravy - B Honey Mustard - B I will be back again for lunch plus I really wanted a blizzard."}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago on whim. I was craving a strawberry sundae, I'd like to add for the purpose of this review, I am not exactly an ice cream of any kind-lover.    Anyway, moving on, I originally went to the local mc ds for a sundae and was disappointed to find out that they have discontinued the strawberry sundae about a year ago. Which led me to DQ.   Taddddaaa! Here I am! The location is busy. Descent amount of seething outside. Zero inside. Kinda small but well staffed and friendly. $17-ish ice cream!!!! WTH!! Ok, I order a small strawberry sundae with peanuts, a peanut buster parfait and a classic banana split...not all for me.   Servings were decent, I suppose. But I'm not sure if I'd spend that kind of money on just ice cream again.   Overall, it was a nice experience and it did satisfy my sundae craving.   See you next year DQ, when my craving rolls around again.   Cheers,"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the most run down location in Champaign/Urbana. When i go to a Dairy Queen i want a happy experience not a truck stop vibe. I'd go out of my way to go to the other locations anytime over this location."}
{"text":"Wow...the customer service here on a Saturday late morning was ridiculously terrible. No greeting, no smiles, no personality whatsoever! The girl preparing the food simply set our items on the counter without saying a word or making eye contact. I guess it's up to the patrons waiting for their orders to figure it out...I don't think I've ever experienced anything like this before. It's a good thing DQ is a yummy treat! Maybe reconsider your staffing decisions."}
{"text":"We were on a family walk and promised our daughter an ice cream.  We arrived at 7:33pm to a closed store.  The sign on the door said open until 9pm and this store was closed and locked.  Very sad to disappoint a little girl wanting ice cream."}
{"text":"...Best service ever!! The food is actually fresh and this location is larger than most. The decor could use a little help."}
{"text":"Expensive. Asked for extra toppings, paid for them, but didn't get extra! They give you more fudge at mcdonalds for cheaper. Lol this place is still better than mcD's or Sonic & hubby LOVES the blizzards so I guess we will keep coming"}
{"text":"Perfect for a hot summer day, temperature rising to 115+  Anyway I ordered chicken strips with fries (it also comes with toast LoL). and i ordered my chocolate ice cream cone dipped in chocolate.  Wasn't too happy about the food -- tasted like frozen microwavable dinner. ANnnnnnd my chocolate had no flavor -- Plaza Bonita DQ tastes waaaaaaay better."}
{"text":"Go visit Malcom! Great customer service. And the ice cream was on point! It's not a full service DQ. But I am very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Their Hygiene Ethic Sucks!   Let this be a warning to you. I went in for an ice cream cone and the young woman at the register dropped my change on the floor. Not a problem, down she went and swept it off with her left hand and gave it to me. Great! I thought.  Then she proceeded to get a cone from the stack and used her left hand to not only pick it up, but was kind enough to insert a couple of her fingers (very recently used to gather some coins off the floor) inside the cup.   I didn't say anything because there were many people waiting, and I figured I'd just throw away the cone part (which I did) ...  but I will definitely not go back there! EVER! If you get something from there and get sick, well you know you had an extra helping of floor dirt with your ice cream ....   The staff seem to be clueless about hygiene and disregard simple procedures like not touching foods with their bare hands after rubbing their fingers on a filthy shop floor.  Disgusting!!! I'd give it ZERO marks if I could."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen has really expanded from just Dairy products, haven't they? I mean now, they have all kinds of things to eat, drink, slurp!  I remember when about 50% of the menu was some sort of swirly soft cone dairy thingee.   They still have those, and they are really pushing their Blizzard product, all manner of \"junk in the gunk\" ice cream/shake thing. Ice cream and choclate syrup wasn't enough, so lets throw in some chocolate chips, candy pieces, sprinkles, peanut butter, whatever!   Me, I am boring, Just give me a plain Vanilla, Chocolate, or if they have it, Coffee flavored soft cone, thank you!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream as expected from dq service was exceptional thanks to Andrew, will return in the future thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"It's DQ! Love their ice cream and this location has great service! I'm not sure what else to say!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight after work since I was starving and haven't gone grocery shopping in God knows how long. First off it was really clean and everyone was friendly and service was fast.  I ordered a chicken strip basket with gravy which was yummy. The fries kinda sucked but they always have been kinda blah here. I also ordered a large hot fudge sundae with extra hot fudge which was way over priced and not worth it. The hot fudge was sort of gummy and gross. Okay it was super gummy and gross. Not sure what was up with that, the sundaes at Sonic are half the price and a million times better.  I'll definitely be back for the chicken strips, not so much for the ice cream."}
{"text":"the woman who runs this place is a nutcase.  She reprimands her employees in front of customers, even an elderly employee who couldn't do a more physically demanding task even when younger employees offer to pick up the slack.  She reprimands employees for putting a little extra whipped cream on a child's ice cream or for giving a customer an extra dipping sauce!  give your patronage to a business who appreciates their employees and customers alike!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream place ever. Dairy Queen never disappoints with there creamy and yummy ice creams. They have so many different flavors to choose from and a different flavor of the month, each month. I haven't tried there food, I only come for the ice cream, but I love that it's so creamy that they give you your ice cream upside down to show that it won't fall out. Best ice cream to get when your craving a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Ah,  DQ and their yummy Blizzards,  what would life be without them? Thank god I don't need to ask.   I always get my favorite,  Heath bar with carmel added.... I really need to branch out,  but it's soo good!  Big chunks of health bar mixed with almost too soft soft serve,  you really can't go wrong.   I always have them add a few squirts or carmel,  it really tops it off.   My daughter got the Triple Berry smoothie,  which she liked fine,  but they gave her a large insted of a medium.   Only a big deal,  because she'll never drink the whole thing.   DQ will always be our cold treat fix, and  my bathroom scale hates me for it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The place wasn't even busy. Waited 15 minutes for a Blizzard and eventually got the wrong size and flavor while 2 of the employees were just walking around. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Stop advertising iron-grilled sandwiches if your grill has been broken for FIVE months!  I complained via the DQ website and received a well-written letter from the franchise owner.  In his letter, he said that the grill had been replaced and enclosed two coupons for a free iron-grilled sandwich.  When I used the coupons, in two different visits, both times, the sandwiches were served on toasted bread, not iron-grilled.  The second time I was told that the iron grill didn't work,  WTF?  Fix the damn grill or take it off the menu.  I mean seriously."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream... On those nights we're craving a sweet treat but don't feel like driving to Two Scoops, we meander to Dairy Queen. It satisfies the sweet tooth but not much more. I like the Hawaiian Mini Blizzard and they make it just as well as any other DQ. If there's a crowd, expect to wait. They are frequently understaffed and the staff that are working are awfully slow. We usually take our ice cream to go because IF there's a table available it's usually sticky, in need of a good wipe down/sanitizing."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say? It's Dairy Queen. Burgers, fried food, soft serve ice cream. I'd say \"meh,\" but given the food desert that is Verona, with open arms I welcome this iconic American franchise to town. In fact, I rate DQ's burgers the best fast-food burgers in Verona. The lettuce and tomato are fresh. The patties are well-cooked, well-formed and you don't have to peel off the burnt, crispy edges before eating (I'm talkin' to you, Culver's). They beat Mickey D's and the overpriced, unremarkable Michael's burgers. Until a Five Guys, In-N-Out or Smashburger rolls into V-Town (fat chance, all), Dairy Queen will remain the fast-food burger king (small b, small k) of Verona."}
{"text":"Ordered a mushroom burger and a large Orange Julius, the lady at the drive through hands me a medium and asks \"you said medium right?\" I didn't but I said it's okay, then waited about 10 minutes for the burger, I was okay with the wait, she offered a free blizzard which I declined respectively, finally got my burger to find it was just a hot sloppy mess, drenched in gravy, making the bun really soggy, probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"Worst service! Ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a Sunday. Instead of being nice about it the girl told me I ordered it wrong but she would remake it for me."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday afternoon Ice Cream with our puppy .. The manager advised the girl working the drive thru that they Do Not participate in Pup Cups:(... We won't be back.."}
{"text":"This DQ stays pretty busy, but if you see a line to the door, don't let that stop you from going in. The friendly staff keeps the line moving quickly. I've had the cakes, ice cream, and $5 lunch deal, all are great! Love stopping here!"}
{"text":"Regular quality you would expect from DQ, clean, and the staff has always been friendly.  However the downside here is in the speed of service.  They always seem to have plenty of staff.  In fact at times if almost go so far as to say they are tripping over each other. The problem exists both inside and at the drive thru window."}
{"text":"We knew what to order. Someone was in front of us, ordered seemed like the world of everything on the menu.  They got a small bag.  10 mins later, waiting. Our turn, paid for buy 1 get one free sundae, SMALL size. 6 mins later, we got our sundaes, wow. I guess that's drive thru for you at this location. Other places are so much. Sundaes, eh.  Brownie cookie dough And ores cheesecake, delicious"}
{"text":"The main appeal of this DQ for me is the location. Right before my husband's birthday I had just grocery shopped and was driving out of the lot when I spotted this place. My husband always wants an ice cream cake for his birthday so I knew it was meant to be.   On a weeknight the place was not busy so the man behind the counter helped me right away. There were plenty of cakes to choose from and he retrieved a cake from the case for me. It turned out that on this particular night there was a 50% off cake special. Score! I was so excited that it was convenient, available, and on sale!  The cake was as good as other DQ birthday cakes I've had and supplied us with cake for days."}
{"text":"This location has been here since the 60's-70's and is as much a part of the landscape of the west side since before I-77 and I-85 were even interstates.  Wilkinson Blvd use to be the main road into and out of Charlotte, and this is when you knew you were getting close to downtown Charlotte.  The building is as much a piece of history, and has not changed much over the years.  This is the way it has always been at this location.....you wait in a line, place your order, and enjoy the nice tast of DQ heaven under the sun under a few covered patio tables.  The service is fast, friendly, and the prices while somewhat higher than the early days, still brings smiles to hundreds of people every day longing for the simple days of ice cream, moms, and dribbles of chocolate on the shirt.  This is just down the street from another iconic landmark BBQ King.  Stop by and reminisce the days of a child in the original DQ heaven.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"They are slow as shit in the drive-thru, when you should have your most proficient workers there. I worked at one for 13+ years and their staff needs to be better trained.  They also need to mix their blizzards better and work on those cone curls. Take pride in your products and you'll be a little more efficient."}
{"text":"I visited this location on two separate occasions and both times were absolutely horrible. The place is disgusting and the workers don't seem to care. The first time my boyfriend and I went we waited almost a half hour FOR TWO BLIZZARDS. Their way of apologizing was offering us two expired coupons. The next time I went by myself to see if maybe it was just an off day for them. Nope. The place was still filthy and my ice cream tasted spoiled. I will never return to this location. Such a shame because I love Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Blizzards were on the spot as usual but the chicken fingers advertised were cold to the touch and bread was harder than a rock. Just stick to ice cream."}
{"text":"I have had challenges in the past, but this was by far the worst. My order taker was very helpful, but the rest of the staff acted as though they were trying to avoid work. Orders just sat in the window getting cold. Partial orders were delivered to the table with an attitude. The manager was unapologetic and unconcerned about the unpleased waiting customers. I don't mind waiting for cooked when ordered food, but none of my order as cooked at the same time. While waiting for my order an employee came out and informed me that they did not have chili and then displayed an attitude because I requested  a refund for that item. I am a manager myself and understand that there are mishaps, but it is how you handle the recovery that redeem your1a service efforts allowing for customer to leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Blizzards, - they are amazing. Do yourself a favor, don't get a blizzard after eating ethiopian food - I learned that the hard way"}
{"text":"this was the worst experience i have had in like forever. first when i get there they tell me that this location doesn't yet have the new sandwiches.(even though the 29 others do) well i just roll with it & order a #3-the flamethrower-looks alot like the new a&w firecracker-a double cheese with spicy jack-hot tobasco mayo & peppers. they told me it would 5 minutes & they would bring it out. i started looking at they ads & i was ready to get a banana split & get another to go for the kid. but then the food came out........ it was so terrible i took 2 bites & spit it out. greasy, greasy,greasy. no flavor beyond the grease. it was not spicy in any way-the tomato was frozen, the lettuce was the white piece from the center, the little smear of pink mayo was in no way spicy and the cheese was just white it had no peppers in it or anything. no jalapenos or peppers of any kind on it. and the burger was disgusting-greasy & slimy. a freezer burnt frozen patty. the second bite i bit something hard like a rock and it was over. the fries were undercooked and the soda was flat. the management seemed completely clueless. no wonder this place is empty every time i have ever driven by. i would recommend doing what i did for 10 years before today-just drive by! or if you do stop just take the $$ & a lighter and watch it burn!!"}
{"text":"We just got back from here.  http://www.dairyqueen.com/us-en/store-locator/  Every time we go, everyone's happy. This is a GREAT place to get a frozen treat, not just in the summer. They have Blizzards of over a dozen flavors. Right now (gotta find out until when exactly), blizzard of the month featured are girl Scout mint cookies!   They have a special menu (for now) that's 2 for $3, 3 for $4 and 4 for $5. Inside they have posters of cars and Americana that's not just limited to the 50's. they also make ice cream caked for kids' parties. they also have a window with DQ logo wear. But, the first time I went there it was packed, and since, the stock has gotten lower and lower. I'm waiting for them to replenish so I can get a button up/ uni type shirt.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Poor service. It took over a minute for him to get to the register with no greeting.  The lone employee was on his phone and had to call them back because customers arrived.  The order was correct.  The dessert was good (hard for him to mess that up).  The bathroom was messy with no trash bag in the can.  The common area was average."}
{"text":"This Dq is always busy and I have never had to wait long for ice cream or the yummy chicken fingers! They are always nice, professional and accurate."}
{"text":"One cannot go wrong with a sweet treat on a hot Valley of the Sun fall day!  This DQ has solid offerings, is clean, and they are pretty quick with the orders.  My issue is with the extremely angry, moody, rude older Hispanic woman that works the counter regularly on Monday afternoons... She just oozes hatred... Hatred for her job, hatred for the customer, and hatred for everything in life... And that's why I can't and won't give this place anything more than two stars; because every time I head to the freezer for one of my tasty DQ treats the bitter, angry woman appears in my head!"}
{"text":"Checked hours 10am-11pm. Pulled up to drive thru at 10:20am and worker walking in yelled at me that they dont open until 10:30am? Fix your business hours or dont show up to work late. Do better."}
{"text":"Our ice cream was melted by the time we got home and we only live about 3 minutes away. I had to eat my peanut butter bash in a bowl because it was so messy. It was still really good though!"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with this location because it did not have hamburgers on its menu.  Kinda silly since they have chicken sandwich and hotdog, etc.  I was also disappointed with my hotdog order.  I ordered a foot long hot dog.  The box it came in kinda made me giggle since it was so long...duh...foot long.  But when we got home, it was actually just two hot dogs in the box.  Ukh!"}
{"text":"We came through the drive thru one night and ordered a cookie dough blizzard and a medium chocolate shake. The drive thru was packed and it took forever. Then they screw up and instead of cookie dough they give us m&m brownie and the chocolate shake tasted vanilla. I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday in the middle of the afternoon.  I ordered a Reese's Pieces Blizzard. I received my order with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Went in drive-thru for my son... And can hear everything thru the headsets! A bunch of young kids working that don't care.. Food was thrown together & looked like crap! Threw it away!! Waste of money on food.. Desserts are good but watch them make it..  Don't trust the kids working here with your Food"}
{"text":"This is a perfectly decent Dairy Queen, where we headed after a long hiking adventure. We were pretty pooped, so we wanted something close to our AirBnB, otherwise I might have ventured further and more adventurously.  The service was fine, although I found it unusual that they don't have chocolate in the evenings. I am not sure if this is a DQ in Canada only thing, or just an idiosyncrasy with this location."}
{"text":"First 1 star review I've given... Sad to say first off the place was dirty. The cashier looked like he wanted no part of working there. All of the employees were wearing jeans which is out of the ordinary.  So aside from the mess and the negative employee attitudes, I ordered an orange Julius. After I gave my money to the cashier and was rang up they proceeded to tell me that they were out after I already paid. So I went with the regular smoothie to save the headache. It tasted awful. It was just yogurt blended up with ice. It tasted like regular 90 cent yogurt. Worst 10 dollars I've spent by far. DO NOT GO HERE SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY."}
{"text":"So... I went in to get an ice cream cake made for my daughters birthday and all there cakes where so half ass I could have made it myself for the 30 bucks I spent  The \"happy birthday\" was not good quality at all and I was completely disappointed, seeing as tho I always get my cakes from DQ"}
{"text":"When I was in the drive thru window, I witnessed the employee who took out the trash hop behind the counter and start handling ice cream without washing his hands. What made it worse was that he dropped the spoon to one of the blizzard's I ordered on the floor, then picked it up and stuck it in the blizzard with a top - so gross. No way I was going to eat that so I cancelled my order and received a refund. Just a warning to really watch the employees handle your food through the drive thru window if you go here. I know I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I called this location and asked if i could use my dairy queen rewards app, and the guy on the phone said it was fine as long as it synced into their computer. So then i proceeded to drive 15 minutes to their location. When i arrived at the drive thru, the guy at the window was extremely rude and said that i was only able to use the coupon if it was printed out. The app specifically says that you just need to show the cashier your phone and sync the app onto the locations computer. I then got out of my car and walked into the store to talk to the cashier who continued to be rude and then another guy came in who acted as if he was on something, and the both of them told me that i could not redeem my reward. I am extremely upset about this situation because i was given false information over the phone and i was not able to redeem my reward. I will definitely not be returning to this location and i don't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get my always there \"mini\" blizzard fix.  I don't normally find myself in the Cotswald area, but this shopping center has much more to offer than a Harris Teeter and some other shops.  Depending on what you are looking for you can easily spend a nice afternoon in this area.  The DQ is of your standard DQs...  service was quick and friendly and the dining room was clean.  We just beat the DQ rush since after we sat down, there were 20 people that came through and there was a bit of a line for a while - I just sat there enjoying my blizzard in front of impatient, screaming kids.  It was a bit satisfying."}
{"text":"This place is small, and cramped, and it's not always the best service.  That said, they have a patio you can have your Blizzard on.  So if you're not looking for anything more than that, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place I believe is permanently closed. Was in the area and wanted DQ, drove by and the windows were boarded up. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Surprising as it may be, you can find nice, clean, up-beat places on the East side. This DQ happens to be one of those places. Although it is small, it makes up for that in good customer service and a very clean, tidy store.  My husband and I stopped here after lunch one afternoon to share a blizzard. DQ is DQ pretty much and blizzards never really change. As long as you can turn your cup upside down and it doesn't fall out, you're pretty much guaranteed a good ice cream treat.  Overall I'd return here when a craving for a blizzard or a dilly bar hit me."}
{"text":"I like this DQ, but it's hit and miss on the quality of the product.  Sometimes they get things correctly, and other times not so much.   It's been in this location for years, and it used to be a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Came to grab a quick bite and was blown away by the service. The staff were so friendly and helpful. I will be back."}
{"text":"The ice cream blizzards are good but felt pretty warm inside and the serving counter mat by the register was old, dirty, and had a big hole in the plastic....never seen that before in a business. Time for a new one guys. Other then that the ice cream was great."}
{"text":"Slowest services ever!!! There were no one in line and it took them 15 min to make a chocolate dipped cone and an oreo blizzard . I would give them no star if i could."}
{"text":"To me every Dairy Queen is the same. Nothing really stands out. Service is always sub par and no one ever looks happy to be there. This location is probably the worst one I've been to. I hate writing bad reviews and really try to look for the positive of everywhere I go, but today besides the icecream being good (as it should be) the service stunk. No acknowledgement when we walked in, flies everywhere, and an employee either on break or just getting off work in the seating area with a friend being loud and obnoxious. I get being a teenager, but you're in your work clothes, in your work space, with kids around and behaving like an idiot. Respect yourself and your job. Smile and say hello when customers come in. If you don't enjoy your job find one you will."}
{"text":"Seriously!!! five dollars for a soda and french fries that's ridiculous and then I lowered it to a small drink and regular fries and it was still another four dollars you can save that price that is ridiculous !!! can go to Burger King or McDonald's or Wendy's and get an entire meal for that price and then the Pepsi tastes like carbonation"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen has gotten so stingy with their products in recent years. I just came through and ordered the new Royal Oreo Blizzard, which is supposed to have a central core of chocolate. That \"core\" went down two inches at most, and there were hardly any Oreo pieces in the cup. It basically looked like a vanilla shake after the initial inch or so. For $4.75, I expect better. Many of their \"top tier\" treats have disappointed me recently. It's just so predictable, yet here I sit again, hoping for a better presentation and value, only to leave underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This DQ is getting a face lift and it looks like they're almost done with the remodel.    The good: DQ now offers a \"Mini\" size which is PERFECT for my periodic Half Health Bar, Half Oreo Blizzard cravings.  The bad: The Drive Thru takes FOREVER!!  Seriously, I don't know what is happening inside when there are only 2 cars in the parking lot?!  The ugly: The damage those Blizzards are doing to my heart and ass"}
{"text":"Special summer blizzard flavours are here! Limited time offerings include Summer Berry Cheesecake, Jurassic Chomp, Smores and Cotton Candy. In addition, they have 2 new signature creations: Peanut Butter Cookie Dough and Caramel Brownie.  I asked what the Jurassic Chomp was about and was told it was fudge and peanut butter. I decided to try it and was left disappointed. It was really more like soft serve with a hint if peanut butter (versus gooey swirls) and huge chocolate bites (I guess that was the \"chomp\" part). If you're looking for a heavier chocolate dose, just go with good ol' Chocolate Explosion.or the Choco Brownie Extreme."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this Dairy Queen.  I ordered a small Blizzard and my BF ordered a hamburger through the drive thru.  We were handed the Blizzard then told to pull forward as it would take time to make the burger.  When we asked how long, we were told 10 mins.  We questioned that amount of time, being a drive thru and all, and he then stated \"that is just an estimate, it will probably be 5 minutes, but the car in front of you ordered food too\".  By the time his food came, I was done with my ice cream.  The hamburger was not that great.  We are going to stick to ice cream only from Dairy Queen in the future."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this place and I wasn't impressed. They are overpriced and the food is not that great. Also, the ice cream that you're supposed to be able to turn upside down and not spill a drop was not as advertised. However it could have just been that it's so hot outside that mine melted a little while going from the drive-thru window to my car window. Highly doubt it though. Don't think I'll be going back here."}
{"text":"I'm a lil disappointed in this Dairy Queen! The food's regular DQ fare. But they have a loyalty program that hardly ever works. First off, they never ask you, if you have a loyalty card. They've removed the tablet in which you can enter it yourself.   The other day I went there, ordered lunch and had a buy 1 get 1 free, Blizzard offer. I told her about that, she went ahead and put it in the computer, then when I got home, I found out she charged me for the blizzard, even though she put it in the computer that I had Buy 1, Get 1 free coupon. This isn't the 1st time this has happened there."}
{"text":"This is the closest ice cream place to my house. I wish I could give it five stars but unfortunately I've been here enough to see the problems.   First off, the best thing about this Dairy Queen is not the ice cream but the fast food. The burgers are always good and not thrown together like other fast food places.  My biggest problem with this place is it is never consistent. My wife and I have both ordered the same blizzards here and one will be great and the other horrible. I think one problem is the staff. It is full of younger kids who just don't pay attention.   I have noticed that when they are very busy, it seems that they do a better job. If you go when they are slow, the kids working are usually screwing off.  So, why do I go here? It's down the street and even a mediocre blizzard is better than no blizzard at all!"}
{"text":"They had great service when I came. I ordered a mini blizzard, and the cashier told me that it would be the same price as the small if I wanted to upgrade. They were nice and smiley, and the place is really brightly lit. When he brought the blizzard to the table, he actually did the upside down thing! I feel like most people don't care to do that anymore. Another worker got water for us which never happens to me at fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen very much which is why I don't want to say anything bad but I go here fairly often and each time I come something almost gets missed. I really love the ice cream so I would be devastated if I didn't get it because they forgot I ordered it. Sometimes I'm not sure if they know what they are doing. Other than that people are very nice here."}
{"text":"It's quite sad. But no surprise to why DQ is filing bankruptcy with this kind of service. If you don't want to work around people, don't. But don't take it out on my kids and I because you hate working here. Food made wrong, reminded several times our ice cream order and still got it wrong 3 times. And then got pissed when we asked for the right ones... figure out the simple stuff and the big stuff will take care of itself. Not very complicated to treat people like they matter."}
{"text":"The cost of doing business This location has a restroom policy in place in which between 2-4 pm they do not let high schoolers use their restrooms even if they are paying customers. Their claim over vandalism, sex and drugs is absurd. The fact that they can't afford the costs is also absurd. If you own a Dairy Queen then this is the cost of doing business."}
{"text":"No complaints. They get my order right. The customer service is satisfactory. Drive thru speed is satisfactory. Prices are average for deserts now in days.  It isn't in the best location in my opinion, but definitely the ideal place to stop in the summer."}
{"text":"Just your run-of-the-mill fast food place.  Staffed by new people constantly, it's not the best place to walk up to the counter and ask for a recommendation.  As far as Dairy Queens go, though, this one is just fine.  My orders have always turned out right, and the blizzards always well-mixed.  If you're looking for a quick, guilty treat, you can get it here."}
{"text":"Would give this a 0 out of 5 if I could. They always get our orders wrong. And when they get it right there are barely any ingredients in the blizzards. They would do better if they would only pay more attention to customers rather than there own conversations. The customers should come first, but they don't in this location."}
{"text":"All I care about is whether or not it's clean and they have chocolate ice cream. So far this is my favorite Dairy Queen out here. It's in a fairly clean area and the employees are always nice.  You now get 3 stars for closing 15 minutes early and for not answering the phone. It says 10:30 not 10:15. I drove all the way here looking forward to a late night treat."}
{"text":"I LOVE DAIRY QUEEN!  Well, mostly their blizzards! I went and was very surprised that you buy one get a blizzard free of the same size or smaller. This definitely made me happy :D  My favorite is their oreo blizzards! That's what I usually get although their strawberry cheesequake blizzard and hawaiian blizzard is also yummy!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you need to review a place and know exactly what it is. Is the fast food place and not a gourmet restaurant. In terms of fast food I find it really good and the options are exceptional as there are plenty of different things you can order. Food taste is going to be hit and miss for a lot of people but I do like it plus one of the big things for me, is you can get ice cream and any place that serves ice cream is a bonus in my book. When it comes to ice cream this place is one of the best in terms of fast food places."}
{"text":"This place of filthy, the drive through window had ice cream finger prints all over it like it hasn't been cleaned in days. The staff is rude and untrained, very poor customer service, no thank you, no have I nice night. When I got my order I said thank you, and the window slammed on \"than\" not one word out of the girl. Terrible experience, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"DQ is pretty cool. So came here to get the $6 deal and I ended up getting the $7 bacon burger deal (came with small sundae, pop and fries). Love the ice cream. The $7 bacon burger deal was pretty good. It looked small when I got it. But it was filling.   Also location is not bad. Its close to 17th ave. Parking is available outside because its located in a stripmall."}
{"text":"Been here a billion times, food is always the same. I love the Blizzards.  DH loves the Banana splits."}
{"text":"We've given chance after chance for this location to just get a blizzard right and tonight was just another aggravating visit. We didn't understand why my blizzard was stacked in another cup until I got to the huge rip in the side of the original cup and found the ripped piece of cup just free floating in the blizzard! On a past visit our midnight truffle blizzard came with NO truffles and when we brought it back and spoke with the manager he was rude and handed me a cup of the topping to \"go add yourself\".  The staff have no customer service skills or even common courtesy; if someone is handing you THEIR MONEY you can at least greet them with a hello and if you had any back round in customer service you would read back their order, give them a total and thank them for their business, you do not just open the window and put your hand out. This was the last trip to this location; $4.00+ for crappy service is too much."}
{"text":"First time stopping by this location. Just a bad experience came to simply get a ice cream cake. Apparently all their cakes are a surprise, because they dont take the time to put a label on them. They had a tag on it saying cake may contain allergen please ask store  manager for more information. None of the staff were aware of the Flavor or even sure about any allergens that may be in the cake. Management or the owner needs to step up their game cause this is unacceptable, I always stop by the other DQ locations and this wasnt a very good experience. Based upon the  reviews this DQ won't last very long."}
{"text":"Very unorganized and slow every time. My last trip there we ordered plain cheese burgers and got home to discovered pickles and mustard. We sat one time waiting forever as our cones melted on the counter. Ice cream is good but burgers and fries are marginal at best."}
{"text":"Always been good!  Had a choc ice cream double dipped in cherry!"}
{"text":"I don't know if they only ever have 1 employee working but I've been here twice now. Once during the day and once at night to feed a chocolate craving. I had to sit in the drive through line for at least 15 mins until I could even order my blizzard not to mention the wait to get it. Slowest DQ I've been too"}
{"text":"This store is horrible. All I ever see are teenagers working, and they are freaking rude! The last time I went in there, the girl behind the counter took my order, made my blizzard, then handed it to me... WITHOUT SAYING A SINGLE WORD!!! I highly recommend going somewhere else for your sweet tooth needs."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. I arrived a bit after they opened at 10:30 AM. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. I also ordered a medium brownie Blizzard. It was all delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a blizzard triple truffle they've been advertising on TV radio they've got posters up everywhere and they don't have it there out seriously who manages this Dairy Queen Dairy Queen should look at getting new management for this location if he can't even figure out how to keep in stock the one item that they're blasting all over media that you should come try"}
{"text":"Very rude people except 1 girl that was new. Hope the other attitudes don't role off on her!  Any way sorry that I asked for the rest of my order!  The look and attitude was ridiculous.  Also the boy that took my order was rolling his eyes like I was waisting his time.  Sorry. What happened to customer service.  I work in the customer service industry and I would make some changes up front.  Food was good for Dairy Queen tho!"}
{"text":"The service sucked... Don't go there during lunch because the older males that were there were rude and rolled their eyes at me any my friends when we got to the window and told us to hurry up because they had a \"long line.\"  Food was okay but service sucked. I wouldn't go there during lunch ever again."}
{"text":"Complete disappointment! Doesn't Dairy Queen equal ice cream? No chocolate ice cream at 730pm on a Saturday night... Does it get more disappointing than that? I think NOT!!!!! You suck DQ!"}
{"text":"The owner is so kind, have known seen him in here  for years. DQ is a classic and this one rocks!"}
{"text":"Lisa the shift lead has a very bad attitude! She really did not want us to use the bogo coupon we had. She charged our card without even getting us a total. I had a banana split blizzard that had no bananas in it! You prob won't ever make the manager position with that attitude you have!! Keep on making minimum wage!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Who teaches these employees how to make the menu items?? I ordered 3 freezes (usually slush mixed with ice cream) and I received ice cream mixed with flavoring... I requested them to fill my cups more and they refused. WILL NOT be returning"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is not on my list at all wheel it comes to ice cream establishments, but my 3 year old nephew was with me the other day as I attended a doctor's appt.  The wait was extremely long as my doctor was behind schedule.  My nephew was such a good little boy, playing quietly & waiting patiently, I needed to celebrate the wonderful big boy he was becoming.  Dairy Queen was next door so off we went.    The place seemed to be run by teenagers.  It was clean but the atmosphere was poor.  The teens were very much into their gossip and not at all attentive.  I was asked if we would be dining in or carrying out.  I said dining in.    When our order was ready, I was handed an ice cream cone and the strawberry sundae I'd ordered for myself was in a sack with a lid.  We sat down at a table inside.  After making sure the nephew was content with his cone, I opened the sack.  No napkins, no spoon and maybe 2 teaspoons of strawberry sauce on my \"sundae\".  So much for convenience.  You get what you pay for.    -Next time, I will drive the 2 miles in the opposite direction for Rolled Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Messed up my order.  Un-professional service. Ice cream was melting when they handed to me in the drive through."}
{"text":"Horrible service, takes 20+ minutes for 4 cars to get through the drive through. Staff can't be bothered to even mix the blizzards all the way. Go to the one in River"}
{"text":"What I like about this DQ is they have a machine with rubber balls in it for .25c and my six year old niece always asks to go so she can add a few balls to her collection. Love the blizzards."}
{"text":"After being thoroughly disappointed in another establishment I head to DQ. One of the first things I look for in a place is the state of the parking lot. This place is packed, and the locals are my indicator of where the good places are.      I opt for the drive through, and it ends up being a bit of a wait. The service is friendly, just not very fast, and that's because the ice cream dishes take a minute to make. Kudos to the staff here for taking the time to get them all right. I also got a burger,  but that was nothing special, just a typical chain burger. My milkshake was good, with chunks of strawberry and smooth creamy ice cream. A tasty finish to my day."}
{"text":"OK, the positive thing I will say... The service has been pretty friendly all the times I have went there.  Now, for my major complaint... Every single time I have ordered here I have specifically paid for extra topping in my blizzard, and somehow at this location each time I start eating I realize my blizzard has next to no topping at all and mine as well just be called a \"Blended vanilla shake\" or something.  Dear management, if a customer specifically has no problem paying for extra topping at least give them what they paid for!  Today was literally the 5th time this has happened! I am not exaggerating. 5th time. Each time we come back I try to give you the benefit of the doubt.  Now, the Mesa store on Country Club, they have done us right every time.  I wish this Rural location would get it together cause you are nearest to us.  Here is mu advice people, If you do choose to go to this location and actually want a blizzard with some product in it, you are better off bringing in your own candy from the AM/PM down the street and just mix it in yourself. ;)"}
{"text":"This place didn't wow me, it was also below average to me.  Customer service to the drive-through was pretty lame wasn't too happy. Kids working here with terrible work ethic look like they hated their jobs. I did get a strawberry banana shake which turned out pretty great but I'll stick with Bahama bucks, or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Slowest Dairy Queen we've ever been to. We're currently going on 25 minutes in the drive thru and still have 4 cars ahead of us. The inside is the same - we've tried both. Definitely need to work on either speed or staffing."}
{"text":"This place has the slowest and worst service out of any fast food restaurant I have every seen in my life. Average 15 minute wait if you are the only person in the drive thru. God help you if there are any cars in front of you. Absolutely atrocious."}
{"text":"You know how I feel about dirty bathrooms - this place gets 2 stars - nothing at this location was basically any better and yet the bathrooms were filthy. You can't mess up ice cream - so enough said. Don't go out of your way for ice cream if this is where you think you want to go."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst, but definitely fills the need quite well. DQ doesn't fall under the late-night category but it does fit my requirement of comfort and quick. All deep fried goodness, DQ burgers are better than the fast chains (McD, JiB, BK), and DQ uses a Frank's Hot Sauce.  Recent EPIC discovery upon my last visit: you can add hot fudge to the bottom of your Blizzard. BRILLIANT!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this isn't a positive post. I've been to this establishment numerous times and it's always a long wait. Even for a cone! They are ALWAYS out of chocolate ice cream,  so don't ask for a twist. It was hard to understand the guy at the window as he speaks broken English and mumbles really fast. There is absolutely no urgency with the staff.  The franchise owner should be ashamed of themselves for not taking care of their business better."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 1 star because they only have vanilla soft serve.... Why not chocolate?! I find this very strange and annoying."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen has exceptionally bad customer service, when asked to clarify upon information, they were short, rude, and dismissive.   Tip: do not park here for even 10 minutes to do anything else, even if coming back to restaurant, cars get towed regularly. This is due to the owner being home and watching through the cameras.  Very shady and rude to customers"}
{"text":"Walked in and the girl behind the counter was leaning and not paying attention. Another customer walked up to ask a question about his food and the girl was annoyed that he bothered her. When we got up to the counter and my wife asked a question as to what was in a certain blizzard and the girl had no idea and wasn't willing to ask the other employee. She simply stated \"I  don't know, I don't eat brownies\". So A quick google search gave us the ingredients in the particular blizzard. When we finally order our blizzards and got them they were not very frozen, they weren't served upside down (because she didn't want to clean the counter) and one of them was substantially less full than the others. To which she replied \"there must be more stuff in the others\"... Really, I can tell that just by looking at it. Overall this was the worst experience we have ever had a DQ and would tell anyone interested to STAY AWAY from this particular location. The employees don't seem to care about customers, product or even their jobs."}
{"text":"This is a new location so of course it's going to be clean and nice inside, however with that said I don't normally order food but I did today and my food was hot fresh and good. The cashier very polite and friendly. I was happy that one was built in Goodyear and even happier with this location close to home!  6/14/18 Hubby had a ice cream craving so we came here, place is still very well kept inside, clean. The staff are so friendly here, there is another location that I go to usually cause I will be shopping or something but this locations staff is so much better!!! They are so helpful and polite! Great customer service, and of course great ice cream!! Love the new Twix blizzard, hubs had the s'mores which was also pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the nicer Dairy Queen's and I'm so happy but the next closest to me is really sketchy. This has comfortable seating, clean restrooms, they have a large selection of cakes, the staff were all friendly, definitely worth the further drive for me."}
{"text":"First time at this location and tried the $5 lunch. Great deal, great food and very friendly and staff! We will come to this location from now on (instead of the much less friendly S. Rainbow location)."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru June 9 at 12:15 pm and ordered pretzel sticks. I watched the woman drop the tray they are cooked on on the ground, pick it up, and cook my food on it. When I told the woman at the window that I no longer wanted it because of what I saw she just closed the window and came back with my money. Not even an apology or denial. Absolutely disgusting and terrible service."}
{"text":"It's a Dairy Queen (an now, and Orange Julius...so bonus points).  I like Dairy Queen's blizzards. The ones here are good. They have a drive-thru (which can get crowded). The inside seems clean, and there's a patio that seems clean.   That's all I got."}
{"text":"Just came to this location 30 mins before close, and no one answered us at the drive thru. So we drove up to the window, and after hearing an inordinate amount of cursing through the closed window from the staff, we were ignored again. The staff member looked right at us and then continued what she was doing. With people working here, that obviously hate their jobs so much, I doubt we'll be back. It looked like they were trying to clean up everything so they could get out as soon as it was time rob close, so they were just ignoring the remaining customers."}
{"text":"Can I give less than a 1? This has to be the worst DQ ever. I've come several times only because I live close. The staff is always young kids. While this doesn't bother me, the fact that they are incapable of getting any order right does. Once I had to give a banana split back twice and it was still wrong. Service is incredibly painfully slow too.   Also, they ALWAYS run out of some sort of blizzard pieces and once, they even ran out of vanilla ice cream! You're DQ! How do you run out of ICE CREAM! That's your main ingredient! I mistakingly stopped here again today and the sign at the drive thru simply said \"no burgers.\" So if you do make a bad decision to come here, there's a good chance they'll be out what you want.  Do yourself a favor and if you want DQ, choose any other location than this one. Your better off buying your own ice cream at the store or not even eating it at all!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent DQ location. Indoor and outdoor seating. Cakes and other frozen treats always available in the freezer. Very clean. Also an Orange Julius location."}
{"text":"Customer NO service. Enough said. I hope they don't actually want $15 per hour. They aren't even good enough for minimum wage. Last time here."}
{"text":"Stopped by at DQ because it was on the way and that wasn't a good idea!  Super slow service at the counter and they couldn't even get the chocolate dipped cone right! Won't be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrible experience. This is my second time here and shame on me for coming back a second time. I figured a second chance was due being that they had just opened the first time around. The service is super slow! I'm still waiting in the drive thru 22 minutes so far with only 3 cars ahead of me. They need better direction on how to be more efficient. When I finally got to the window the guy was apologetic, I could see & hear employees discussing who was going to do what. It was like watching chickens with their heads cut off. The order was right this time but come on! It's ice cream & should not take long to get. Cars behind you get frustrated & honk which is super annoying. I rarely submit a bad review. It's really bad. I will not return. They are not fast during peak hours at all. I wish them the best but I don't have the time & patience to see this place get better."}
{"text":"Tried to go on a few different nights and EVERY time we've gone-within an hour of their closing time...amazingly, their machines were down! Every time we've gone! This is ridiculous. Closing time is closing time. Don't say you're open til 9 and clean up early, just so you can go home early. So not right-will not last long!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I think it's really neat that they bring your food to your table and it's always super clean! The blizzards are to die for and they make a show of turning it upside down prior to giving it to you :-) it's located on south ft Apache next to a subway and it's one of my stops on the way to Rhodes Ranch. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This DQ has been here forever! I used to go here a lot back in high school, when I was craving a Blizzard or a banana split. Prices are still reasonable, service fast and friendly, and with the addition of Orange Julius drinks on the menu, this is a great place for dessert."}
{"text":"Tiny little Dairy Queen which now sells Orange Julius drinks.  Got a julius to go.  I don't think they've quite perfected making them, because my julius drink was missing some key components, making it taste like a sugary slushie rather than a frothy, light drink.  The mango pineapple flavor of the julius itself was more mango, not so much pineapple, and as mentioned before, tasted overwhelmingly sweet (Probably because my drink was just syrup and crushed ice)."}
{"text":"Your standard Dairy Queen. Ordering was no problem and our orders came out quickly. I had the S'Mores blizzard which had a good amount of chocolate but I wasn't sure where the marshmallow part came into play, and I couldn't taste enough graham cracker in it. The parking lot is situated in such a way that you have to dodge drive through traffic to get to the entrance door which makes it a bit of a hazardous experience if there are a lot of cars wanting drive through orders."}
{"text":"Service questionable, not to friendly. People not with it at all. Last time. Sorry, can't understand the service, or lack of."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen could get 5 stars for their blizzards and staying open late! Unfortunately, find my picture and see that I'm reviewing the food and wait time. It was a 15-20 minute wait for two chicken strip baskets. The one pictured was my 4 piece (count them, only 3!). Not to mention, they were more like nuggets, measuring just a few inches long. Now, this is not the DQ norm and I was embarrassed because I assured somebody that they actually have good fast food, not just soft serve. Lol. Fail!"}
{"text":"The employees here are always nice and will start a conversation with you. They are very friendly and the service is excellent. I love the little baked snack melts they have here and the stawberry cheesecake blizzard is the best."}
{"text":"I just went to this location. I ordered a mint Oreo blizzard. Got home only to find out it was a regular Oreo blizzard. Went back through the drive-through told them the order was wrong and they took the regular Oreo blizzard back and said they would get me a new one. When I pulled away I took the lid off only to realize my blizzard was like a milkshake. They must have just added the mint into the regular Oreo blizzard. The blizzard that was already half melted. If I wanted a milkshake, I would have ordered a milkshake. Not to mention it was $2.99 for a mini which might be all of 4 oz."}
{"text":"The blizzards are always great. The staff is always friendly. Never eat inside so could not comment on cleanliness of the restaurant. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Being the ice-cream addict that I am, monthly trips to DQ are a staple in my life. There's nothing really special about the inside of this location. It is small, the staff aren't overly friendly, it gets crowded because its one of the only fast food places around. The outside seating is where its at though.   There are about 5 tables that are in high demand. I suggest snagging the seats at your arrival and getting someone else in your group to order for you. The seats are far enough behind the restaurant where you don't feel like you're sitting in traffic, in fact, the view is pretty nice. There is a fair amount of greenery in this area.   As far as the icecream goes - its delicious. The ice cream cakes, too. If you like the blizzards, go to the dairy queen website and sign up for their \"blizzard of the month club\". You'll get coupons for free blizzards every now and then."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! I'm not sure how they are in business trying to cut corners when they make your order. Many blizzards including the cakes require cold fudge which they don't carry apparently. So disappointed in our order we got an instant refund once I got attitude from the girl behind the counter. I won't be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to pick up a birthday cake for my daughter today.  Wow!  It was the best ice cream cake ever.  Great price for the largest cake $23.  The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star rating is because I wish this store had a full grill.  Hot dogs don't do it for me.  There is nothing like a hot off the grill Dairy Queen Cheeseburger."}
{"text":"the worst place that i ever been i when to get i chocolate dip cone when i got to the window it was little over 6 dollars didnt really care about how much but when i get there was'nt what i order it was a chocolate dip cone they give me a chocolate cone  i try to tell the girl at the window but she pause for like 30 seconds and said i dont have it we run out literally with out checking  kicking me out the window telling me that it was late they run out i was so upset because i didnt go to mcdonnal for a cheap 1 dollar cone i when there because they had chocolate dip cone next day i call the manager  to tell him about my poor experience hopping that he would i least look up my order and opologize look in to the situation i wasnt sure how the lady look but i discribe a little bit he said noone in my drivethru looks like that i told him the time, what i order, and how much he also blow me off not even try to look up my order at all when i let him know that i was sure going to write a review about my experience he said go right ahead what those that say dont give a damn either Dont recomment this place very shitty service and shitty food  be aware people save your self a trip to this location. there is a reason why they only have 2 stars. the one on sunset have way better service..."}
{"text":"Decent food-- you can't go wrong with the chicken strip basket! But let's be real, we go for the ice cream! My kids favor the blizzards! I love the iced hot chocolate-- it's incredible. Or if throw it all out the window & care less about calories my go-to is the peanut buster parfait! It's the best thing on the menu! I just wish it didn't account my entire daily calorie intake!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific drive thru stop on Scottsdale road. Great location and I absolutely love their popcorn shrimp and dipped cones. I am amaze at how big the large dipped cone is. I'm partial to strawberry, but the chocolate dipped cone is like an ice cream brownie! Great hours too."}
{"text":"Came here with 4 kids, ordered 4 medium blizzards, i got 4 large blizzards and got charged for the large, luckily they were running a buy one get one for .99 cents deal. Kids enjoyed the blizzard.  Place was clean, lots of seating inside. Staff was friendly enough.  I asked for 3 covers because kids couldn't finish the large, and got the covers with no attitude.  Will try this place again.  Seating outside, and parking onsite."}
{"text":"I always love picking up a quick meal from DQ. This location has very classic décor. Lots of great selection for their ice cream cakes and frozen treats. As always I got their chicken strip meal deal with a chocolate sundae to go. The meal is a excellent value for the price.  I dug into right when I got into the car. I found the food very oily, and the sides of the take out box was greasy and messy, the bottom of the box liner had a significant amount of oil pooled on it. The chicken strips were tiny; almost like half the size of other locations I've been to. I wonder if they bothered to drain my food before giving it to me...   Otherwise, the chocolate sundae was nice and firm, and survived the trip home. If I were to visit this location again, I will probably check the quality of the food before leaving the store to ensure that the quality is up to par."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is still opened and it hasn't been shut down due to health codes! I don't even know where to start on this review. Should I start with the horrid customer service from teenagers who don't care? Where is the manager? Besides screwing up my order, after taking forever, the ice cream cone was soft. When I inquired about it, he told me because the weather was hot? Really? Others complained about their blizzard being soup and they were out of product. Plus the teenager who did not appear professional was hiding product in some sort of freezer as ice cream was tipped over. The store was not clean as trash was over flowing and looking in back there was fries and other trash on the floor where they keep the food. Ick! SHUT this place down!"}
{"text":"I would them zero if that was an option.  The lines are always Long and take forever. Not because there are a lot of people because they move so slow. Half the time the order never comes out right and up repeating yourself multiple times. They have been out of chocolate ice cream at least five out of the times we have been there. I wouldn't continue to go back except for it is close to our house. Definitely more frustrated and disappointed than I am happy coming into here."}
{"text":"Gotta love Dairy Queen. While owners have changed over the years, this store has been in the same spot for nearly 50 years!!  Great soft serve in traditional vanilla and now Chocolate as well. A wide variety of sundaes shakes etc. served by some of Rantoul's friendliest people."}
{"text":"We came for the chocolate covered cherry blizzard. My favorite since I was little.   3 stars for a few reasons  1) although not her fault, there was only one person working. I have seen her there before and she moves slow when she is working with someone else. Now that she was working alone, she moved in slower. There were two people in front of us and it took nearly 30 minutes to get our blizzards.  2) The blizzard was not as thick as it should be. It was pretty runny by the time I got home. Normally, it's still thick and ready to eat when I take it to go.  3) Neither blizzard was mixed very well. Some really good spots and some really plain sports. It should have the same flavor constancy all the way through.  I love these blizzards and have a real soft spot for ice cream. I know we'll be back. I just hope it's better next time."}
{"text":"Went here at 9:55pm. The place closes @11pm,  but the dining room shuts at 10pm. I went drive through and ordered a couple of dipped cones and a 1/4 Lb bacon cheeseburger. They served me the two cones at the window and told me to drive around front where they will deliver the burger. Several cars drove through before my burger was delivered over 10 min later.  The food was as expected. Nothing great. But I don't appreciate being told to get out of line when I'm ordering a simple burger at a fast food drive through.  Further, while we waited the 10 minutes we counted no less than 30 people tried to enter the restaurant only to find the dining room was closed. Most people left, a few went through the drive through. With two hotels right next door seems odd that dairy queen wouldn't keep the hours late for all the people wanting late ice cream or small meal. Summer hours in Arizona heat seems the right combination for later hours at an ice cream spot."}
{"text":"Just ordered Triple Truffle blizzard. Shows chocolate ice cream in the picture on the drive thru menu but was made with vanilla and very very little chocolate. Was supposed to have caramel. No caramel. Whoever made this blizzard must have started today and has very little training. How can you screw up a blizzard that bad? Very disappointed on this hot day. Oh, and it's 4.79 for a medium! Not going back any time soon that's for sure"}
{"text":"Having kids, I make my way around the valley trying different spots for ice cream to be creative. But this is my go-to spot for sure! Family favorite. Best Dairy Queen in the area. Everybody who works at this location is so nice, attentive, and seem to actually care about pleasing the customers. They're always busy and move very efficiently! I've never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for anything there. Everybody is always smiles, it's a pleasure going in there anytime! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient service. It was early afternoon, so no kids around. Pretty typical of DQ. Good price."}
{"text":"I worked at this location 15 years ago. New Management has overtaken it since and I have seen a drop in customer service, mainly in the drive-thru.   Margie, Grace, & Jennifer made it abundantly clear that the customers came first before anything else. The drive-thru was fast. Unless of course you got a rush. Nowadays you get attitudes, Employees taking their time..and not for the sake of quality standards.   [Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"I would give a negative 10 because of the dishonesty and rudeness how me and my boyfriend were treated . My boyfriend left an item of his in the bathroom when he went to go look for it it was missing , only 2 employees went to the bathroom after my bf when he confronted the manager she gave us an attitude and was plain rude calling us liars that there was nothing she would do . We asked politely because it was important to us they just told us to get out of the store we weren't rude or anything when asking about the item."}
{"text":"Was next door waiting for my girlfriends doctor appointment when I got hungry so I walked over to this place. Says doors open at 10:30 so I checked my phone and surprisingly it was exactly 10:30, so I reached for the door and it was locked. I decided to wait 5 minutes in the chair outside and watched an employee walk in and lock the door behind him so I left. Needless to say if your establishment opens at 10:30 then be prepared to open at 10:30. They lost my lunch business for today."}
{"text":"From the greeting to the way the word blizzard just zazzled off his tongue Delvin owned the drive through like the bank owns the car I drove through it. He brought the blizzard to Vegas circa 2007. I thought I was watching David Blain when he flipped that blizzard upside down and all the ice cream cowarded in fear of following the natural laws of gravity. Delvin Lord of Ice, Savior of the drivers through I hope the eyes of management see your true hidden late night glory shining through like my phone receiving a text through a tight pair of jeans. Delvins thorough devotion to the creaming of ice insured my cheese cake chunk mining experience produced adequate rewards even when deep below the depths an inferior Dairy Queen would say no such things dwell. May we meet again Delvin Lord of Ice."}
{"text":"First time back since the horrible experience we had here last time and it was better. Made jokes about the bad experience to the employee who was here when it happened and she was laughing about it with us. Although she was nice and friendly I still give this 3 stars because of the lingering fart like affect from last visit. I laughed when she came to our table and turned our blizzards upside down since last time our whole ordeal was over exactly that. Good service but nothing came of our complaints. Bad management."}
{"text":"In the last 6 months I have gone to this location I have ordered a Royal strawberry cheesecake blizzard on four different occasions.  I ordered a mini size. When I got home there was not ANY strawberry flavor.  I didn't say anything until the second time, I let them know I had gotten a a cheesecake blizzard and was given an extra side of strawberries at no charge. The third time I ordered same thing happened.  Barely a trace of strawberries.  I called spoke to a manager who offered to remake the blizzard. I agreed and drove back to DQ. Well I ordered another medium sized blizzard today, requested extra strawberry which I paid for. Once again barely a trace of strawberries! It should be called a Cheesecake blizzard!"}
{"text":"This is tough. I hate giving these low ratings, but you had one job. I ordered a small Oreo royal blizzard. The cashier rang in a small Oreo fudge royal blizzard. I was ultimately handed a medium peanut butter cup blizzard. Seriously?  I mean in this day and age it is a good thing I don't have one of those funky peanut allergies or I'd be flopping around on the floor like a fish out of water. I didn't say anything to anyone, what good is it going to serve. I suppose I should have to see how the staff and management would have handled and rectified an incorrect order.  According to the Facebook location for this location they do a lot for the community. That is great to hear. They certainly have taken business away from the nearby ice cream competitor, so hopefully when they see these not-so-great reviews they will jump on those issues and get them straightened out. I haven't seen a night where there aren't cars wrapped around the building. Definitely a welcome sight to the area.  Positive: The property was clean and well maintained. The cashier was very friendly. The inside of the restaurant was clean and in good repair. The Men's restroom was clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"It seems that we've been on a whirlwind tour of Dairy Queen locations recently, and this is no exception.  While the Plaza Midwood store looks like it might be one of the originals, and the - possibly closed - counter in Eastland Mall probably opened not too longer after, this Cotswald outlet is of the newer variety, and as such, makes me wonder if it will be more like the similar style that's near Wal-Mart on Albemarle Road (a bad experience all around).  For whatever reason, I have to say that it wasn't - the staff is generally quite nice, and service is good.  The only downside to the whole thing is that the store doesn't have much seating inside, so you should typically prepare to get your goodies to go."}
{"text":"Moving to the correct location...  Now as I've mentioned, Dairy Queen isn't the first thought I have when I think ice cream, especially after the last experience on Albemarle Road.  But that's one of the newer locations, that has sit-down seating and that fancy air conditioning and all.  Not here in Plaza Midwood.  This place doesn't even have an inside (not for customers, anyway).  I don't even think they have a bathroom.  You just walk up to the window, get your treat, and you're done.  To make things even better, service is always given up with a smile.  These guys are good, and they know it.  The lines are almost always five or six deep - or at least they have been every time that I've been there.  Though you can't sit down inside (or outside, since they don't even have picnic tables), I'd rather take the trek here than one of those fancier places.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Worse experience EVER they are charging for the FREE cone day stating that it is a donation towards a children's fund when iAsked for a receipt iWas abruptly interrupted by a store manager that looks like a recovering meth addict that stated that this was the owners idea not hers so after I paid $0.50 per cone the white families that were after me weren't charged and were giving a substantial difference in amount. I can see why this place is rated so low and believe you and me I'm contacting corporate since events like this are free both ways and either the owner or management is trying to make money out of this which is just sad when I asked for a receipt I was giving a receipt that had NOTHING to do with that I ordered or paid for.. WTF"}
{"text":"Never again will I come back here for my lunch break. I have 30 minutes and waited for my food for 20 minutes !!!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in the Midwest I've always been a DQ fan, and I'm glad to see that they have a presence in Vegas. I don't do their burgers, I could care less about their grill offerings. It's all about the soft serve or Blizzards. An M&M mini sized Blizzard on a hot Vegas summer day is one of those wonderful things that makes the heat a little more bearable.   4 Stars: Get in, get chilled, and get on with your day. This location has never messed up an order, and the drive through is always fast."}
{"text":"I love this location! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Also, you just can't beat the $5 meal special."}
{"text":"It was so hot today I decided to stop for ice cream, what a great idea. I am not a huge fan of Dairy Queen, I really like no sugar popsicle kind of girl, but major need today. The service was super fast and efficient, I got the KitKat blizzard. Super creamy and yummy, I do not regret my choice, the place was packed and everyone had a smile on their faces."}
{"text":"Drive thru worker was rude and had an attitude. Asked for extra chopped nuts and they gave me whole salted peanuts on my hot fudge Sunday . Highly disappointed ."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location since my debit card was compromised here about a year ago. Thanks for that, by the way. But I had cash and needed to go to the gas station across the street. This was the closest drive-through, and I was pressed for time.   Never again. I was stuck in the drive through for TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES. When I finally got to the window, the guy just repeated my total. No, \"hey, how are you, sorry about the wait.\" When I got back to work, with just a couple minutes left to eat, I find out my order was wrong. If it takes over 25 minutes and you still can't sort out a couple pieces of chicken and fries...you have serious issues."}
{"text":"The ice cream is just ok, probably won't be back. I saw the guy not flip one of my blizzards. When u don't flip the blizzard it is supposed to be free. We had 2 blizzards, the girl flipped her and he didnt flip his. When we called him out on it he said he flipped it, like I knew he would, then he changed it and said only one has to be flipped together. there was only one girl that greeted us after being in there a few minutes."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen, Dairy Queen, does what ever a Dairy Queen can. Yup! It's got blizzards and cakes and dipped cones - oh my! And everything else a DQ is supposed to offer. This location has been open for as long as I can remember. I used to grab the odd blizzard with coworkers when I worked down the street. Tonight I popped in for a small dipped cone with my mom. There was a steady stream of people coming in and out of the store, but no hold up and a good turnover of ppl. And my dipped cone was just like I remembered it! I like that my small was an a-ok size and that you can now get a mini-sized blizzard. I never could finish those things..."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars if I could. Horrible customer service! They refused to correct their mistake - and told me I had to it pay full price for a new item that was not made correct the first time. Will never go back to this location!"}
{"text":"You get for you pay for. Sometimes inconsistent from visit to visit but always friendly and serves great sweet treats."}
{"text":"Terrible! I see why it's B rated. My chicken sandwich had old lettuce on it, the fires were burned and flavorless, and the cheese I paid extra for wasn't the same as the other locations. So disappointed and I'm pregnant!!!"}
{"text":"Occasionally I stop at Willoughby Dairy Queen to get take out, since I work in the area and it's close by.   I don't often write reviews unless I'm really impressed or a place really gets under my skin. I figure, my continued patronage is a good enough review for most places that do an OK job of providing decent, everyday service. But, Willoughby Dairy Queen has forced me to venture from my busy and comfortable bubble...  I have to say, the food's not bad, but the ice cream has taken a dive, over the last few years. It tastes like frozen marshmallow; not the regular, middle of the road, drive through quality, vanilla ice-cream I usually expect from \"soft serve\" joints, but I like their fried mushrooms.   It's usually pretty busy, so I have to wait in line most visits, which (unwittingly) gives me a pretty good perspective on the employees. Many of whom are professional and courteous. But...  While waiting in line to order food, last week, pondering if I should order an Ice-cream cake for my son's birthday, I happened to witness one of the employees, an elderly lady who's often behind the counter, being really rude toward one of the customers. So what, if the customer was taking somewhat of a long time ordering her blizzard! She was asking the employee if there was this or that ingredient in various concoctions, and the employee impatiently snapped a smart-ass answer using the most annoying, nasal tone, something to the effect of, \"What do youuuu want in it? Just tell me what you want!\" and rolled her eyes as she turned and looked toward some young girl behind the counter, while the customer was trying to answer her. I don't know if that's her real voice, or if it's just the way she talks to customers, but it's really annoying! The other worker was obviously embarrassed.    I usually ignore stuff like that, because she's elderly, and maybe the she's having a bad day... But, this is not the first time I've seen this woman act like a complete douche. She's wholly consistent with her negativity. She NEVER smiles or greets customers in a friendly manner. With nearly every customer, including myself, I've seen this woman interact with, she acts like their requests are the biggest imposition on her day. I don't know if she's the owner's mother-in-law, or what, but if I treated anyone at my work like that; client or coworker, I'd be gone! So, I can't figure out why else she's still working at Willoughby Dairy Queen, other than she's someone's family member. It's obvious, she just hates people!   Anyway, a few months back, I witnessed her talking in a condescending manner to the middle aged blond lady who works there. I assume, the other employee makes the cakes, because she was holding a pastry bag at the time and she's taken cake orders from me, in the past. Although, they were sort of in the back when I witnessed Ms. Nasty dressing her down; \"HELLO\", customers can see and hear you... Don't tell me she doesn't realize others can hear what was going on; it was totally unprofessional!   The cake lady has been very sweet and helpful when I've had to deal with her. I can tell she genuinely likes people and has gone out of her way to go over different design ideas and talks to customers about everyday life, in general. Also, I've noticed, whenever she looks at someone, she smiles! She should be the one in front dealing with customers; not Ms. Nasty!   I don't need a particularly blissful experience, every time I go for take-out; neutral is just fine, but I've had enough of the negative. After last week, I'll be crossing Willoughby Dairy Queen off my lunch rotation, because it disturbs me to witness such unnecessarily abusive behavior towards others. Life and work are too stressful, as it is, to have to consistently feel stressed going into any particular fast-food joint, too.  Hopefully, Willoughby Dairy Queen will get a clue and can that wretched hag!"}
{"text":"This place smells so bad. It's like sour milk and raw sewage mixed together! You can even smell it out in the parking lot. You open the door and it hits you like a brick wall in the face."}
{"text":"Just a side note before you start reading, I am what you would consider a regular at this location, i come here just about every day and I've put up with a lot of their mess ups and have swept their rude behavior under the rug multiple times(one time the guy laughed at me because I didn't hear him and said what) merely because it is the closest location to my house. But this is definitely the last straw. So I was trying to order the $5 lunch it was 10:55 and she said I can't serve you that it starts at 11 and the way she said it was rude so I was like by the time I get up to the fuckin window it'll be 11 and she was like I'm not allowed right now and I was like okay I'll wait She was like k. I got up to the window and the manager was there and I said she was rude and he was like well I can't have you swearing at my workers and I was like I wasn't fuckin swearing AT her I was just swearing  then he said I got mad that I couldn't get my chicken right then and I was like NO it wasn't that it was the way she fuckin worded it she could have said \"I can't ring that up right now but if you pull up to the window I will ring it up cause it'll be after 11\" and he still proceeded to defend her  I was perfectly fine waiting I knew it wasn't 11 yet but the way she worded it and said it was like sorry fuck you you're off by 5 minutes bye  I have never once left a review or spoke to a manager about someone in my life but that was crazy, especially with a MANAGER talking back to me"}
{"text":"Location is very good because I live right down the street and it's in the plaza I always go to because of the bank and grocery store.  Cashier and maker of my peanut butter blizzard was very nice, and very quick.   Place was pleasantly clean and there was no line.  Will absolutely return!   5/5"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have to have a Blizzard!  Same family has owned this one for years and they are nice folks who sponsor local sports teams etc.   Oh... And they have a drive through..so you can hide your guilty pleasure...  Three stars only due to the price as dairy queen is not a great value, but they do have some unique and tasty treats"}
{"text":"It's dairy queen.....this one is the newest around so more up to date, of course the menu is the same."}
{"text":"Never use a credit card at this location. Especially through the drive-thru.  This past Saturday, I ordered food there and paid with a card.  The receipt they gave me was different than what was billed to my card. Out of principle I was angry and felt like someone stole from me (it was only a dollar but theft none the less).  Then I looked at my receipt that said \"cash\" and got really confused.  I placed a few calls--leaving a message with a manager and a voicemail.  The GM or owner called me this morning saying the drawer was \"over\" $2 that day, and I could come get my dollar.  How could it be over by two dollars cash when I paid by credit card? That makes zero sense. Their solution is for me to spend two dollars in gas to go collect my one dollar. I don't understand how these people are in business. It makes me wonder how many times they've pulled this game on me and people like you. I would never usually notice something minuscule like that on my statement, so they probably do this often.  It's a decent way to pad the employee tips I suppose.  I hope they enjoy this buck.  Be warned."}
{"text":"This DQ has indoor seating but it's a tiny arts and needs some serious updating. We usually go through the drive through. All summer sand fall the drive through line is really long. They do a lot of business because they have been in this location for many years and there are no other ice cream places near by.  They have never messed up an order and you can't go wrong with DQ. All of their concoctions are good."}
{"text":"Way to close early! Granted it's 9:55, but posted hours say 10 PM. I nearly ran over a milk crate blocking the drive in and I wasn't the only car puzzled in the parking lot."}
{"text":"The service has been crazy slow every time I come here. Honestly the only reason I come here is because it's close by."}
{"text":"Line went quickly. Employee named Richard was nice. They seem to be making more of an effort than usually which was appreciated."}
{"text":"Another Thursday night and they didn't mix my Blizzard properly. Time to write to corporate...smh"}
{"text":"I must have come during the best time of day because the drive through was empty! The drive through speaker is a good volume and my order was repeated to me before I pulled forward. My Blizzard was made correctly and they flipped it upside down even though it was SUPER hot outside. By the time I got back to work my Blizzard (what was left) had melted but it was still good while it lasted."}
{"text":"For a Dairy Queen and rating it what it is, fast food, they are quick, always get my order right and never had an issue here. After 20+ visits thats good for a fast food place. Compared to another fast food chain....who will naMe anonymous, I've been to all 3 of those chains in Sun Prairie several times and they're at about a 10% success rate! parking and getting out of the drive thru is probably the biggest problem here."}
{"text":"This is a nice and clean Dairy Queen location that also has a drive-through. I stopped in for a quick ice cream cone, and they were very busy. The cashier was still very friendly even though she was obviously swamped. They got my ice cream to me in a timely manner and it was very good, on par with other Dairy Queen locations."}
{"text":"I give a one star for several reasons.  My family likes to come here a lot for ice cream and the occasional lunch.  They have a banana split deal on Mondays that is buy one get one type of deal.  I went through the drive through on a Monday night, and the line was long. By the time it was my turn, I ordered and she told me that deal was only for walk ins. Seriously? So I had to wait in line in the drive through, then go inside to go order.   The other one was tonight.  We came in for 2 blizzards.  So much for that advertisement of, we will flip it over and it will stay in your cup, if not the next one is on us.  Well this time we waited about 20 minutes for 2 blizzards, and the guy comes to our table, and just hands it to us. No wonder he didn't flip it over because both of them were mush!  Might I add, he was walking around the restaurant blasting his music from his cell phone and acted like he was high.  I understand it's an ice cream shop and not some high end restaurant, but at least get your act together and satisfy the customers that are in front of you. Not impressed at all. This location will be the last resort for ice cream."}
{"text":"Dirty. Filthy. The stalls were disgustingly dirty, the trash hadn't been emptied all day and there wasn't any toilet paper. The drink machine was out of most of the drinks and what was available tasted nasty. The ice cream was meh and the food was ok. Probably won't stop in to eat again."}
{"text":"We go to this Dairy Queen every once in awhile because they burgers and onion rings are awesome, and we love blizzards.  In spite of the dozen times I have told the staff they don't have to turn my blizzard upside down, they do it anyway. I think its to prove it wont fall out of the cup.  Ive never seen the place dirty or unkempt.  Service is always good. I know a lot of teens come there for food because the jr high and high school is just down the street.  Its a small town franchise in competition with McDonalds, Burger King, and Taco Bell, and I think they do a great job and I like their food a lot."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru. I received a blizzard that was almost all liquid. They had me sign the credit card auth receipt, then handed me the blizzard in a paper bag. Figures. Must be a problem with the machine, wish they would have just told me so I could order something else."}
{"text":"Five stars for the young men(I didn't see any girls, but I'm sure they are just as good) that work at this location! We stopped by on a Sunday night looking for ice cream cones and ice cream cones we got. They were friendly, fast and had a smile on their faces."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience via drive thru since this place opened...blizzards and buster bars never fail me!"}
{"text":"This is the best Dairy Queen in Brampton. It used to also be the ONLY DQ in Brampton for a really long time. They have a tonne of staff and there is always a crowd here. Family, friends, little leaguers.  I like the daily deals they have Monday to Friday. I believe Monday is the peanut buster parfait. Tuesday is the banana split. Friday is smoothies.  Wow... it's sad I know that. The staff here is great. They're extremely fast and friendly. The product is good. The location is good. Definitely deserving of 5 stars :)."}
{"text":"I love this place, I go here all the time and am super excited about the recently added Orange Julius. It also amuses me to see all the different high school kids who work there as the revolving door of fast food demands. Anyway I like this place and will continue to go here and be happy with my mini blizzard."}
{"text":"Thank you Tianna for the excellent customer service tonight. You turned a disappointment into a smile."}
{"text":"Thanks for putting my orders in transportable packages!  Ashley I appreciate you and your teams good service!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, ice cream tasted great and the restaurant was clean and tidy.  They've got a \"Chill Window\" for kids summer sports which I thought was nice too."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen Located on W. Lake Mead in Las Vegas NV. Is Indeed A Great Choice!!  5 Stars Are ONLY Earned by a Business That Provides EXCELLENT SERVICE and Offers A OUTSTANDING Experience For A Customer Like Me (I can be hard to please).  I called to order a cake on Thursday and spoke to Jordyn. She was very polite when taking our custom ice cream cake order. She was extremely professional and made sure we were offered the different decoration selections (flowers, writing) and different colors that were available. Our cake was absolutely  wonderful!! :)  We picked up the cake on Saturday. I was immediately impressed that Gissella greeted us when we walked in. She was very friendly and also polite. She quickly grabbed our cake from the freezer, and asked if it was the way we wanted it? It was EXACTLY what we wanted!! :)   The cake was white, decorated in green and blue, with reese's peanut butter ice cream which is soooo good! The message on the cake was what we requested and looked great. Candles were reasonably priced so we grabbed some blue ones there.  IceCream Cake was DELICIOUS!!!! Everyone was very happy. :)  We were extremely pleased with the service by the 2 young ladies at this location. In a day in age where service tends to be an afterthought, I am happy to say that this  Dairy Queen location clearly values their customers!!  If you have a special birthday coming up or just have a hankering for some dairy queen blizzards, or even lunch/ dinner, burgers, fries, and chicken sandwiches are offered here as well,  I definitely recommend this location! Enjoy!! :)"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is disgustingly dirty and the staff, with exception of a few are extremely rude!!!"}
{"text":"The service was awful, I wasn't greeted the girl took my order with such an unpleasant tone in her voice I get to the window and she seemed so annoyed to be there , never had a smile on her face didn't say thank you just handed my order and took payment , the blizzards I ordered seemed tasteless and the ice cream was almost melted , will not be coming back ."}
{"text":"Just came to this place I had a wrap and my gf had an burger and it was raw on the inside cooked on the outside but raw in the middle I was outraged I went up and told them out loud I have a health concern hoping the people around me would hear this I have been to many but this is the first time I saw this happen for Dairy Queen low standards not buying burgers here anymore!!!!!!"}
{"text":"SUPER SLOW  It's a Friday night and 80 degrees and the line in the drive thru has yet to move. There are only 2 cars and the parking lot has maybe 5 cars.  Why have I been sitting here waiting for my blizzard for over 10 minutes without inching closer to the window??? After another 5 minutes the first car in the line was handed what appeared to be a blizzard, drink, and shake. The car immediately in front of me got a blizzard. The wait time seems excessive!   Once I got to the window I counted a total of 3 employees. The cashier for the window was also the cashier for the restaurant side. The other two employees appeared to be making food. Extremely poorly staffed which directly relates to management!! Summer is here folks you better step up your store or you'll close your doors like two other stores in the city!!"}
{"text":"the vanilla ice cream is addictive but the inventory needs to improve in the star department ... grape stars need to make a serious turn around"}
{"text":"Cute little place but the decor really needs updating. Sundae had very soft peanuts and blizzard was more like a malt."}
{"text":"My preference is Two Scoops (local, homemade) up the street, but sometimes you just need some good 'ole DQ. Something about a dipped cone just makes you feel like a kid again.   Obviously, this location gets really busy during the warm months. Pair that with an awkward parking lot, and it can be tricky to get in and out of here. It's a DQ, you know what to expect. I always get a Blizzard of some sort (usually mint Oreo). Like Christi K said in her review, Dairy Queen may not be the best out there but it is pretty consistent.   Thanks to DQ for getting us through the scorching Summers all these years."}
{"text":"We go here often for inexpensive ice cream cones for the family.  They have a younger staff and they get our orders out to us fast while making the kid's cones how we like to prevent a huge mess.    Tonight, our son was running from the game machine to the toy machines and tripped and dropped his cone on the floor.  I tried to give him mine to finish, but he's 2 and didn't understand that we had to throw his out because he dropped it all over the floor. My wife went to the counter and told them he had dropped his cone and the girl promptly replaced it for him.  That means the world to a 2 year old to have HIS ice cream back. We couldn't have thanked them enough and would have gladly paid for a new cone. We will definitely keep bringing the family here for our sweet treats."}
{"text":"Ice cream is fine but the drive through set up is circus like.  Took 15 minutes to get out.   Should not have a drive through"}
{"text":"I feel like you are lucky if there is not a line when you go because you are going to wind up waiting forever to get your order! If there is a line then just forget the whole thing entirely!  If you do wait for your order and decide to eat it there, good luck finding a table that is not all sticky. The whole dinning area needs a good scrub down, everything is dirty and sticky.  Now that Yuki is open across the street it's much cheaper and quicker to grab some Thrifty's!"}
{"text":"They get the desserts out fast. Love the drive thru. Would be 5 stars if their chocolate ice cream wasn't broken all the time."}
{"text":"I went to this store last night after the website said \"11:00pm\". I get there at 10:30pm and some young arrogant airhead said they were closed.  WTF? When I told them what the website read she argued and said \"We are independently owned we don't have have to follow those hours.\" You effing kidding me??!!! Then why call it a DQ? This is the second time I went and they closed before their listed time.  I wouldn't trust any of these people to run Chick Fil' A on a Sunday!!??   Go elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to this Dairy Queen before we headed to the airport lookout. I was pretty excited about it because it's not your typical DQ. It reminded me of the ice cream places from when I was a child and I sat under the umbrella happily eating my hot dog and ice cream. They had a special for a pop, hot dog and ice cream for around $3.   There's not much around here and once you get farther down the road it gets a little sketchy. Ah, here's to our old soft serve locations. :) They aren't around as much as they used to be, that's for sure. I'd much rather have something like this place than a Coldstone any day. (And that's not a knock on Coldstone... I love them too.) But you can't beat sitting under an umbrella on a hot summer day with an ice cream in hand."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here.  We ordered 2 simple menu items and waited more than 20 minutes.  Finally I went up to the counter and asked where our order was.  Turns out they didn't even have it.  Waited another 10 minutes and got 2 different items we didn't order.  Totally incompetent!"}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen and especially their chicken strips and fries. I get this almost every time I come, and am never disappointed. My one complaint is that every time I do, regardless of I just waited behind other customers in the drive thru, I am asked to drive to the front and wait for my food. Tonight I sat for a good 10 minutes and when I pulled up, I paid and immediately asked to pull to the front. The good thing is I know my food is fresh, but what bothers me is in that 10 minutes I waited behind two customers, my order hadn't even been started? I waited in the parking lot an additional 11 minutes before someone brought me my one order of chicken strips. Hopefully they improve this."}
{"text":"This place was gross... I regret going here.  I should have just went to the Gordo'Gordo's next store.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The last several months the service here has declined.  First I noticed that the blizzards were over mixed and melty.  Then the chicken strips were overcooked and tough and the fries were limp.  Now the blizzard ingredients aren't mixed through, leaving 1/4 to 1/2 of the blizzard with little to no mixer.  And when I brought this to the attention of the manager she muttered something that sounded like an expletive under her breath at me, rolled her eyes, and sarcastically asked if I wanted her to remake it.  Needless to say, I didn't have her remake it because I was afraid of what she might do to it.  This is a great way to lose business."}
{"text":"The \"kids\" behind the counter had no clue what they were doing. Had to explain our order three times before he understood. I will drive a little extra to go to Culver's or cold stone from now on."}
{"text":"Very old & cramped building & lot. Not enough employees on staff to keep up with demand causing long wait time."}
{"text":"My DQ experience today was the best I have experienced at any DQ in a long time.  I don't ask for much - a small vanilla cone.  While most give me a medium and sometimes a large, this one got it right.  You see, when I order a small it is because I want just a little bit.  My family members usually get blizzards so they are much more picky.  The cotton candy blizzard my cohort got was made perfect, he tells me.  Not unmixed ice cream like many previous times at other DQ's.  Whoohoo! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tonight, this DQ was on the ball.  It was very busy but the kids behind the counter were very organized and efficient.  We got to the front of the line in no time and had perfectly made blizzards shortly after ordering.  They did the thing where they hold the blizzard upside down, and the cone I got also had a perfect curl at the top that they like to refer as a smile.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this little Dairy Queen since I was in High School! It felt wonderful to come back to AZ! Thank you to my Brother for taking me down memory lane. Thank you to Dairy Queen for the delicious Ice-Cream!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is located in the community Shawnessy, SE of Calgary.  I found that this location is more about the quantity of the food and desserts.  The quantities are HUGE!  I ordered the chicken strip basket with a poutine and it was over loading the basket, AWESOME!    Also for the desserts, they don't cheap out, they make sure theres the little \"D\" at the top of any blizzard and making sure it'll fill you right up!  A must visit Dairy Queen location, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say the quantity is better compared to other DQ locations."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. I ordered a cheeseburger combo at drive thru. Service was quick and received my food quickly as well. It was exactly what I ordered and delicious."}
{"text":"Just got out of the drive thru at Dairy Queen. Sat down to eat a burger and a corn dog. The food was deliciously hot and fresh. Customer service was great. Would recommend any day."}
{"text":"It was very slow when we arrived, the floors were dirty, the tables where dirty.  In fact, one of the cooks with their blue gloves on, came out in the main restaurant, straightening each of the tables and cleaning the debris from each.  Plus he picked up items from the floor - we saw him touch many items at the counter and then return into the kitchen - assuming that they were making food with those same gloves on....yuck!  I only saw 1 customer enter the store, select then buy an ice cream cake which was in a locked cooler.  Also while we were in there approximately 40 minutes, there was only 1 car that went through the drive in....suggesting that we are not the only clients that have had a poor experience.  I know folks need to train staff, however a new employee took our order; the order was made incorrectly - we ordered a chicken salad and got a chicken sandwich.  While the manager did apologize and make the correct order, the wait was a bit much.  The staff were vey loud and singing in the back while they were cooking the food.  We did not think the establishment was professional at all.  Unlikely we would return to this DQ."}
{"text":"Extremely slow. Employees are not trained well nor have support. Long lines inside and long line in the Drive-Thru. Employees are trying to learn how to input orders on their own. Food sitting in the window for over 5 minutes. No one takes the initiative to walk them out to the table. No one seems to be on the same page. Appears to be no manager to run the team. On top of that customer service is very poor."}
{"text":"The Banana Cream Pie Blizzard has been discontinued. That and the Coke Freeze were the only reasons why I ever came to Dairy Queen frequently. I don't know what they were thinking when throwing out the Banana Cream Pie flavor from the Blizzard flavors, but apparently about half of the previously large list of flavors has been eliminated and now you just have the basic Chocolate and Vanilla (so to speak). The closest thing they have now to what they had is a Banana Split flavor. Sorry, no, just throwing bananas and Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry ice cream in a blender is not something to be proud of as a replacement for the Banana Cream Pie. However this happened, this downsizing, whether for improving the budget or whatever it was, this downsizing of selection was a downgrade in service and in product, and I'm not likely to come back. There are other places where I can get chocolate or vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"First off, I don't know why I let my husband convince me to get the garbage ice cream from here. It truly is crap.  Staff here is incapable of listening, had to repeat our order 3 times at the speaker and they still got it wrong. Just completely annoyed with the lack of professionalism and attention. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location if you do like their products."}
{"text":"Not a good value.  For about the same money as my medium sized mint oreo blizzard, I can get a scoop of real mint ice cream at Sweet Republic with cookies mixed in.  And it will be top quality, too.  Unlike the blizzard I got that was mostly melted yet still wasn't mixed well, so it had this nasty green mint slime swirled in it.  What really ticked me off was the lack of oreos.  I counted 5 (five!) little chunks of oreo.  The store was clean and the guys behind the counter seemed nice, but I'm still sorry about the purchase."}
{"text":"Warning to all - want there to get blizzards and notice the sign buy one get one for 99 cents after I ordered and made a comment while I ordered bringing to light the deal while I ordered I got to the drive thru window and questioned the total I was shocked to what I was told. The manger told me that if I do not ask directly for the special for the 99 cents the  owner instructed them to charge full price and it was on the customer who did not notice and did not ask directly while the order was placed and not to give it to the customer if they ask when they get to the window WOW I was shocked I requested the owner name and will fill a compliant with the state.  On top of all that my order was wrong and I just ended up toss all items purchased  in the trash to avoid the dark lot for fear of what they would do if we went back"}
{"text":"Straight disgusting. Dirty, flies, super slow, the super small dining room was filthy. How hard is it to keep half a dozen tables wiped off."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food. Or they forget to give me my full order and is missing something I am a really optimistic person so I kept giving them a try since they are right next to my house but it has happened the past 5 times. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Last 2 times they have messed 2 orders.  We ordered a turkey bacon club sandwich and they forgot the turkey.  Two nights ago they gave us runny blizzards and ordered a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough blizzard and gave us a normal cookie dough blizzard.  Service is rude too.  We have decided to drive further for a better DQ."}
{"text":"Outside smells like death , trash needs taken out , instantly lost appetite for ice cream"}
{"text":"Was disappointed when I couldn't get a blueberry blizzard, ok fine but really wasn't impressed with how the lady behind the counter treated me like my request was absurd and then get impatient when I was like ok give me two seconds to decide what I want. (I wasn't blocking a line cause there wasn't one)"}
{"text":"For something cold to drink or a treat you can't go wrong. Simple menu I just want to try everything with hot weather coming I will be here more often. Fast service a little bit of everything for everyone."}
{"text":"Visited this location once. Medium cup of ice cream was half full. Line was long so maybe that is why they rushed and shorted the cup. Never had this problem with other Dairy Queen's and I definitely feel shorted. Get your money's worth elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dangit, I needed a blizzard tonight. After a long week of interviews and other stressful events, I wanted to treat myself to something sweet, so I came here for a blizzard.  Mind you, I've been here before, and I have to say, it's not my favorite location.  The other DQ's that I've been to in the past have been clean, well staffed and overall a nice experience.  This one? Eh, not so much.  For starters, its small. I can deal with that. Parking is tight and they only have a few spots.  Sadly, the place inside is not the greatest. The first time I came here last summer, the place was a mess! dirty floors and counters and the pop machine was leaking all over the place. You had to step in a puddle of water to get to the register.  Today, it was actually cleaner then normal. I imagine because they don't have the summer foot traffic, so it's probably a lot less busy.  Service was pleasant, but really really slow.  The guy behind the counter was nice and friendly, but he didn't seem to be getting a lot of help from his coworkers, so that slowed it down even more.  They do have outdoor seating here, but it's limited. They only have a few tables and chairs inside, so if you want, you can always sit outside at one of their tables, which is cool as long as the weather's nice.  Overall, I come here rarely, and it's only because its close to home.  There's definitely better run Dairy Queens out there in regards to cleanliness, speed of service and other things, but this one is not one of those places.  Will I return? Probably only out of sheer laziness to not go any further then I have to, and if I want a blizzard, I guess this is place."}
{"text":"I really wish i could give this a better review but they closed 20 minutes before they were supposesd to and on top of it everyone was extremely rude. Never again, save your money and go get yogurt or something wouldnt be surprised if they went out of business and became replaced with a yogurt shop."}
{"text":"I love their ice cream... but it is WAY BETTER with chocolate dip! I've always been a fan of their ice cream cakes and cold stone creamery doesn't come close to these. Their drive thru is convenient, but not the quickest drive thru I've experienced. The food always seems fresh and hot and I love their new $5 and $6 lunch deals. A cheap alternative for lunch time food. The restaurant always seems clean and the service has always been friendly. A very nice and super convenient business right on Fish Hatchery. Call ahead to order your cakes, especially if you need more than one."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheesecake blizzard with chocolate syrup in the middle and guess what they still were able to flip it upside down lol. Good service just the drive thru seemed slow."}
{"text":"These guys get chocolate ice cream yet?  Been going to the one by the 215 now since my kids like chocolate"}
{"text":"The chocolate covered strawberry bowl was very good. However when you ask what is in the different blizzards, no one seems to know and they have to go get a list. They did find out for me however and were pleasant about it. Always very good, prices similar to other places."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Sat at counter for 5-7 min while staff was takin care of drive thru line and looked at us several times without even addressing us.  Finally a gal came up and asked us what we wanted without even addressing the time we waited.   Bathroom were not the cleanest.  Ice creams were pretty standard.  Horrible service all around."}
{"text":"This place is literally the worst. Hopefully the got rid of the awful management, because the owner is actually sort of nice. I ordered ice cream and just got a sloppy mess and no apology."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  4 employees, one table with 5 or 4 people when we came in, they are already servered.  Two more came in front of us, ordered oreo blizard, then our turn.  I quess they are busy in the drive thru.  After 7 minutes two more customers came in and ordered 2 meduim blizzard.  I quess they forgot about our  orders.  We've been standing there for a while maybe 10-12 minutes.  They served the people infront of us and tilted the blizzards, sir is thi ok, do you need a lid with it?  The blizzards that they gave us is melting and the banana split. Did not even tilt it.   People it's not even busy and you cannot keep up with a few customers you've got.  That's not what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"had an amazing experience and the BEST customer service! I called to ask about ice cream cakes for my daughter's birthday. I was pressed for time and needed to do everything over the phone. They bent over backwards to help me and we're very friendly as well I was able to get what I needed and even pick it up through the drive-thru. this is going to make my daughter's day! thank you for great customer service! big shout out and thank you too Molly (Moe) and Christina"}
{"text":"I waited for ever! My ice cream was give first. Dripping all over, the food took 15 minutes and fries were icy cold. Yuck! Not coming back here"}
{"text":"I went today 10/26/17 and my bf got a blizzard we drove off and when he took a bite a hair was hanging from his mouth ! . So we went back and told them what had happened they replaced it but they have him an unfrozen blizzard it was sloppy. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to others. If I could give them no stars I would."}
{"text":"Had a craving or a peanut buster parfait. Wow did this hit the spot,, drivethru order was courteous and was ready when i pulled up"}
{"text":"I love DQ blizzards which is why this gets four stars and not three! I also love their BOGO coupons from being part of the Blizzard Fan Club which is why I go often.   The service is always just ok. Sometimes it can take a while to be served your order but you can always opt for the drive thru because I think their orders are put before those that order inside."}
{"text":"I won't ever go back here. Simply because of the rude employees. I felt as though I was inconveniencing them by making an order through the drive up. If you hate helping customers so much, quit your job!"}
{"text":"I came in at 6pm on 5/23 and was helped by the nicest person at the register. She had great customer service and was deliberate in making sure the order was correct. I will definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"The coupon deal is awesome. I always get free blizzards!! The customer service is fantastic! #happyfrequentcustomer"}
{"text":"Just tried the chicken mozzarella sandwich. Disgusting! The bun was hard, the marinara sauce was way too much, so much so that you couldn't even taste the chicken. And where's the mozzarella cheese? A mystery. Never, never, never, never again."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the staff here. Jayden, in particular. I came in with an elderly lady friend. She recently broke her hip and was mobile enough to get out for a treat today. She wanted to recreate her favorite treat, but was unsure of its ingredients. Jayden and his co workers (10/18 3pm) were most attentive and genuinely concerned about getting her exactly what she wanted. The manager was right there to help put in the correct ingredients to achieve the desired recipe.  It definitely took some time, but they were most patient, and kind.  She wanted 1 Blizzard to eat there, and 4 to take home. They blended her first one, she loved it and lit up at her first taste of it. While we enjoyed our DQ, they blended the other 4 and put them in a carrier for her. She was so happy. Its so refreshing to see young people actually care about an elderly person. Kudos to the entire staff and Jayden, you shine. I hope you are rewarded for your efforts that made us customers so happy today. Thank you all."}
{"text":"Great service and clean location. I always come here after visiting the library across the street."}
{"text":"Average place to eat average food average service if you're looking to try something unique different here it is once and drive on"}
{"text":"I went to Dairy Queen tonight wanting two small blizzards. This may seem petty but I'm really irritated that my cookie dough blizzard was made with chocolate ice cream. I don't know if this is a new switch from the typical or this is just someone who didnt care. Either way, I'm now stuck sitting on the couch watching me fiancé eat his delicious correctly made blizzard writing this review."}
{"text":"Really no Dairy Queen cakes! It's a Saturday night.   Worst customer service too! Save your time and go to Baskin Robbins two blocks away."}
{"text":"Ok I will admit it...I am a frequent DQ customer for blizzards! As far as ice cream goes this place is great. Try just about any shake, blizzard, sundae, or frozen treat and you will be glad you did. My recommendations include the candy cane holiday blizzard, salted caramel truffle blizzard, heath blizzard, strawberry cheesequake blizzard, and the dipped cone. If you really want to indulge ask for extra stuff and the dipped cone sauce on top of your ice cream...oh so yummy!   As far as the real food goes I cannot say, but I expect it is on par with most fast food joints. It is Dairy Queen people, go for the ice cream. I always do the drive thru simply because I am not a fan of the inside of fast food places, and I usually get multiple treats to take home and put in my freezer for later.   The staff is always friendly and accommodating; they make the treats quickly and get you on your way. This location can be a bit tricky to get in and out of with the traffic on Thomas, but it is worth it. They are currently undergoing construction, but the drive thru is still open. Maybe the inside will be nice enough to make me want to actually go inside when it is done. I look forward to see how it turns out when it is finished.   If you are in search of a delicious frozen treat then DQ is the place for you."}
{"text":"Yikes,  the memories of DQ.  You know, ice cream, treats, a nice nostalgic feeling of the past for kids.  What happened to this place?  I haven't a clue.  1.  Ambiance - Been here several times now, and always the same, bland, not exciting.  2.  Service - Hmmm, perhaps they should turn this one to a self service facility, this would definitely improve the service. A guy was there waiting for his kids sundae. The servers assisted and prepared orders for two other customers that came in after. The guy goes to the server to remind them, they said it was almost ready. Then I put my order in, the guy starts to make mine and I remind him about the guy's kid from three orders ago. So, they start to make it and it takes like 10 seconds. Poor kid.  3.  Service Part 2 - they make my order and the shakes are like slightly thicker than milk. I said no whip and guess what, whip. I ordered one dipped cone and guess what, i got two. I guess you can say that this ying yang approach is balanced???  4.  Air Con - What the heck happened here? No air, no fans, hot and stuffy?  Hmmm, what would a normal store do? Offer free dipped cones!  5.  Service Part 3 - to use the toilets, you have to get a key from the cashier. Guess what, they cannot find the key.  I wonder what the dealio is since this place is usually empty anyway, no need to manager the bathroom.  This is not a bad place, the cones and stuff are decent, but the service and customer care is not in existence."}
{"text":"Love the blizzards! Love this place. Trying to stay away though!! Ice-cream has too much sugar! Ha ha!"}
{"text":"This location is ran by a bunch of teenagers with no experience. After paying for our meal the Cashier made a series of mistakes by not communicating well with his co-workers. First, they forgot to make one of the shakes. Second, they forgot to make one of our sandwiches. Third, they forgot to give our chips. Fourth, after making the shake that they forgot they put it on a wrong size cup. Fifth, they only gave us one bag of chips instead of four.  Seriously, how much mistakes can u make for every customer that u serve..  DQ Corporate Management should look into this location either it's a Franchise or not. Brand marketing is totally not in place at this location."}
{"text":"The staff here is always super friendly. I only really come for dilly bars and dipped cones.  Every time I come into their store it's always clean."}
{"text":"Currently waiting in the drive thru for 2 blizzards. It's taking a lot longer than it should for only 2 blizzards, especially since there wasn't anyone else in the drive thru. But no matter. It's a blizzard. I like ice cream. I'll wait for my double fudge cookie dough blizzard."}
{"text":"Went to this location to get a quick bite and the server was extremely rude! Food was great but server 28 had no customer service what so ever! Will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Not happy at all, my total was 6.40, i gave her a 20, i was digging for some change and she put in i had a 20 and i handed her 50 cents and she had to step to the back to use her phone as a calculator..then she tried to give me 6.75 back as change, then i said \"no that isnt right i should get 14.10 back\" she proceeded to step back to use her calculator, then she gave me 13.10, i said \"what do you not understand, the math is not hard\" she got her phone for a third time and finally gave me the correct change. Definetly will not go back."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've been to this DQ but Oddly enough this is my first time reviewing it.  On Sundays when I go wash clothes at the laundromat on rainbow I stop in to this DQ and grab ice cream or order One of the combos. I've never had any issues in this place, and I've always had good service.  This place is really clean I have never seen it unorganized, and you get your food fairly quickly.   Mainly what I like to buy is the Oreo cookie blizzard, it's so good especially on a hot day. I would give this place a 3.5 stars rating."}
{"text":"It was really busy when we entered this Dairy Queen in the evening. It was a hot day so everyone in the surrounding area seemed to have the same idea as us. At the time I was with a group of seven but the staff at this Dairy Queen was more than up to the task to serve the many that were there. Running around they tirelessly made Blizzard after Blizzard, milkshake after milkshake and root beer float after root beer float. It was neat to see them crank out the ice cream treats with fast efficient service, great attitudes and a smile. A very well ran Dairy Queen. Eat here."}
{"text":"Worst DQ ever. The staff is never friendly and the ice cream is not cold whatsoever. Be prepared to drink your ice cream instead of eat it. I've never had bad DQ. I didn't think there was such a thing. This place proved me wrong. Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"This is a Dairy Queen. It's just as advertised. It's clean, the staff are friendly and efficient. If you're looking for an inexpensive ice cream treat, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Cashiers are usually really nice , different story for people in the back , I was sitting down and through the back door I could hear everything they were talking about , lots is cussing and yelling . They just need to turn it down a bit ."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, they often run great coupons / deals and support the local schools.  And of course have great food!  Where else can you get chili dogs all year long!"}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. Homeboy was giving dirty looks and staring off at God knows what the entire time. I guess the kids behind counter were so preoccupied with how long the line was getting, they decided to quickly make my Mint Oreo blizzard crappie. So the outcome was more of your typical Oreo blizzard with random tastes of the mint flavored syrup. Yuck."}
{"text":"My sons love (LOVE) DQ ice cream cake.  My mother loves (LOVES) DQ hamburgers.  I have enough bad eating habits without claiming this one.  But those I love compel me to stop here several times a year and it makes them very, very happy.  So that makes me happy.  Four stars happy!  Oh yes - I've never used it, but they have a very convenient drive through at the Monroeville location."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen has been around longer than I can remember, serving up a plethora of sweet stuff and appetizing food alike.   This Dairy Queen, Warm Springs/Arroyo Grande, is one of the ones that has the full menu, and isn't an \"express\" location like so many others. Many locations around town only offer an abbreviated menu, including the Boulder City location. Something to keep in mind. If you want a meal, make sure you're going to a location with the full menu.  The roster of sweet stuff is what made Dairy Queen stand out to begin with. The legendary Blizzard is a thick shake that has become the stuff of legend, and is available in TONS of varieties. There are also slushes, shakes, sundaes, cones, the list goes on.  Their \"real\" food isn't bad either. Their chicken fingers are easily among the better ones served at fast food places. Plus, they have a variety of sandwiches and burgers as well.   A few minor complaints I have about this location: -The staff. Actually, most of them are very friendly, but I have had a few bad experiences. My order has been messed up before, and one time when dining in, my order was taken by someone who I (quite honestly) believe was mentally challenged - and I had to repeat the order several times. -The menu listed outside the building at the drive-thru does not have the complete list of Blizzards. Not a big deal, but there are other great flavors not listed there that are listed on posters inside the building. -Location. This is an extremely congested, hectic intersection and parking center, and when Green Valley High School lets out, it becomes Hell on Earth. -Prices. Good food, but more expensive than most fast food.  But Dairy Queen has excellent food, and at the end of the day, I'll always be eating here despite my small quibbles. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Nice and helpful staff. Food was fast. However as soon as we walked in there was an overwhelming bad smell in the entire restaurant. Looking around the entire place needs a good bleach cleaning."}
{"text":"My son and I went through their drive thru the other night. He was gonna get a cone until he saw the sign on the menu about serving the blizzards upside down. He's 8, and thought it was the coolest thing. The spoon doesn't even fall out! This was exciting stuff. I could have saved a few bucks and got him that cone, but we ordered a blizzard pretty much for the big upside down handoff. So we get to the window, and they hand us the blizzard in a bag. In a bag, with a lid. Huh? I don't know why you'd bother to put it in a bag but whatever. I say to the kid, hey it's not upside down, and right away you can tell he's had this conversation before. Without saying a word,he very rudely points to a sign that says this location a franchise. I assume he was saying that they do not follow corporate rules? I said, if that's the case, then why does your menu say you serve it upside down or its free? And this little jerk says, how about I just take it back then? I was really appalled, and I told him that when they promise something and do not deliver, following it up with a smart ass comment doesn't help matters. I asked him his name, and he literally RAN AWAY! He left some other poor kid to stand there and take the heat for his shitty comment. He apologized for his coworker and offered to get a manager, but at that point there's a line forming. We left with our right side up, cotton candy blizzard in a bag, took one bite, and threw it away. Tasted awful, and that's not just my bitterness talking. If an 8 year old kid rejects ice cream we have a problem. Why does DQ allow franchises to make up their own rules? Why is the staff so rude? Do you always waste bags when serving blizzards? So many questions. Worst DQ ever."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick bite to eat and wasn't dissapointed. Food came quickly and was as ordered. Staff were polite and helpful"}
{"text":"I woild give them 5 points just for their ice cream. DQ's dipped ice cream cone is A MILLION times better than mcdonald's chocolate dipped which is gross. I recommended  DQ'S dipped cone. I extremely  disappointed that they do not serve Fries or Hamburgers hense the 3 stars.  Sept 14th 2017. I decided to try their chicken sandwich - Don't waste your money. It's just a cold cut sandwich on a bun.  Grose.  I did notice at the drive through that the ice and cones are handled  with bare hands. I don't want food or drink handled by uncovered bare hands on my mouth.  I watched  the news about fecal matter being in 99% of restaurants who put ice in their machines by bare hands."}
{"text":"I really wasn't going to write a review on Dairy Queen but saw all these negative review of the customer service so I thought I should put my 2 cents in on this place.   I came here after a long hot day at the park and I was hot and thirsty. I just needed something to cool myself off. So me and my son stopped off at DQ. I was surprised they were so busy on a Saturday at 2pm. Lots of people waiting in line. One thing I did notice is there were 5 guys working the counter. Looked like 3 high school kids and 2 older workers.   My son ordered a strawberry smoothy and I just god a normal chocolate dipped vanilla cone. I had one of the high school kids helping me and he really got our order out really fast. I was pretty impressed.   I can understand how some people could feel unhappy with service but these are high school kids. Give them a break and enjoy your refreshing ice cream. Everyone's happy once they eat their ice cream.   The place seemed clean but I didn't use the restrooms so no comment on that. I had a refreshing cone that cooled me off without any service problems. Enjoy."}
{"text":"There should be ZERO stars for the poor customer service my wife and son experiences today. They went to get the lunch specials and was told my wife and son was a MINUTE late to get the deal. From a customer service standpoint it was bad service. Not only DQ lost out on a larger order but will also lose out on repeat business. This shame on the female manager."}
{"text":"First thing I notice when I was in is a cockroach. Then they don't have the signature chocolate dipped cone available."}
{"text":"We frequently this location often.  Tonight we decided to use a coupon.  The young man at the counter was very nice and articulated to us that he couldn't accept the coupon because it didn't state the location of the restaurant.  The manager stood next to him silently.  The coupon did state only accepted at participating locations.  While this location followed their protocol, they lost reoccuring customers due to a small accommodation.  Will two people not returning impact their business? No.  But small gestures like this impact your business in the large perspective because you are turning away good customers."}
{"text":"I just came in from California 5 hour drive so I decided to stop here and Mr James the manager was soooo rude I couldn't believe. He saw me get of my car started to walk up and locks the door and turns of light and doesn't even say sorry sir we are closed . I had to go through drive through and still I asked for corporate number and I get the store number . Wow I just wanted ice cream !!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Visited when they had free cone day the line was quick with 4 or 5 cars in front of us in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Well it's dairy queen and you can't go wrong here if you love ice cream. We went through the drive thru and the customer service was great. The lady at the drive through gave us an extra ice cream cone, that was so nice of her."}
{"text":"Manager here is a complete a hole. Complains about working on his day off. Rude to customers. Makes you take your ice cream before your meal. This place is unreal."}
{"text":"Get it to go, the  counter chick is either deaf, or..... well, deaf.  She's been screaming orders the whole time we've been here. Screaming hello, scared a kid. I'm not joking.  AND the Blizzards would NOT have stood the upside down test.  It's clean, bathrooms, clean. Parking is iffy, stay on your toes, they cray cray in this lot.  Fresh hot food, or fresh cold food, it's all good. The Pumpkin Pie Blizzard is better by far than the Apple Pie Blizzard. By far. Add Pecans to either one to make it triple good. Plus nuts are a superfood."}
{"text":"It's an ok DQ, not the cleanest, not the dirtiest. My Blizzard was ok. Parking ok. They do not have hamburgers, according to a question asked by another patron, however they food posters up?  Nothing remarkable about at all."}
{"text":"Went for Pumpkin Blizzards, every other Dairy Queen in the world holds them upside down, this location couldn't as they are usually a little meaty before they hand them to you.  Parking is small but I've never seen it full. Getting out of the lot us problematic, if you have good karma someone will let's you in.  They keep it clean but it's one of the oldest in Vegas and never been remodeled, an Old Vegas feel with antique car pics.  They have cakes you can just grab and go, I've never tried one, we usually go to Baskin Robbins.  The staff is always very young. Most of the time they are VERY friendly, but check your order, in case a newbie forgot spoons or fries."}
{"text":"Great place of service ! Everyone is great clean bathrooms and customer service was fantastic I will come back here all the time :)"}
{"text":"I come to this location every time I'm in the Vegas area! Best DQ I've ever been to. The service is top notch! Levi helped us out and was pretty amazing. The food here is pretty good and especially good when recovering from a rough night."}
{"text":"I am split on this place, we have been here 4 times in the past few weeks, and all though I never expect much from fast food place they live up to that basic expectation.  they are a hit or miss on service, time, and quality."}
{"text":"Missing food.  Forgot whipped cream on the sundaes. Charged me for larger items when asked for small.   Made me feel like a jerk when I tried to correct them.  Girl at window had an attitude.  Highly disappointed.  Don't think I'll go to this dq anymore."}
{"text":"This location is super close to my house and we always seem to get BOGO Blizzard coupons in the mail. Everyone there is always super friendly and nice. The drive thru can be slow at times, but that is only when it's busy. They have great food and even better ice cream which I why I come here way too often."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for at least 15+ years and it's always worth the money. All of the blizzards are awesome but my favorite is the classics Oreo blizzard. The moolatte is good if you're looking to satisfy an extreme sweet tooth. The strawberry shake is just sweet enough but not too sweet. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Filthy and disgusting!  My family and I walked into this restaurant and were immediately greeted by a higher than expected room temperature.  I'm not sure if there is a problem with the ac or the staff wants the guests to be as miserable as they look. We step up to the counter and the second greeting was a multitude of flies. The staff took our order, not appearing warm or friendly, instead looking slovenly. The order took a fair amount of time to get. Finding a table was a chore since most of them were dirty. The only remotely clean one we found was by the window, but there were no blinds to shade the dinning area. The only person that I saw cleaning a table, was a customer before she allowed her family to sit. My mother had an orange Julius which was less than favorable. It was lacking the distinct vanilla flavor and the orange was overpowering and bitter. Store needs an intervention."}
{"text":"Has been remodeled. Orange Julius was added which is nice. They added one of those fancy soda machines that have tons of different selections. I just sent my husband over to help a senior couple figure it out. This is going to be a problem. One of my biggest pet peeves is paper signage in any type of business. This place has 3 on the front door, 2 on the counter and 1 on each of the registers. Tacky. Run your business, train your employees and keep your signs to yourself. If your twitching to make signs, put one on the soda machine with instructions on how to use it. Other than that the place looks good and my Orange Julius is tasty."}
{"text":"Went to this location yesterday for a birthday cake and there were absolutely no cakes in the freezer--all empty.  Went today to get a non cake treat and the place had no chocolate icecream!  Ordered blizzards ice cream was very melty.   I would love to know who is managing this store. I will drive a longer distance to avoid this location."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to be writing this review.  Why, you ask?  Well it means coping to a number of things:   1. I was at Dairy Queen.   I'll stop there.   Naw, I'll keep going...  2. Even though I'm lactose intolerant, there's just something about a blizzard I can't say no to.   3. Yes, even Yelp's lover of local winds up at a chain every now and again. It's usually during a dark period or when I'm leaving a meeting in Sun Prairie and I drive by the only DQ I know of in Wisconsin.  4. The basis for my low rating is a terrible blizzard that crushed all my blizzard dreams.  5. The real basis for my low rating is the fact that they took out friers, so gone are the days of crisp \"chicken\" fingers and white bread... seriously why were the baskets served with white bread?   At the end of the day, the product, and I mean water, maaaaaybe skim milk and flavoring just didn't meet my expectations as blizzards have before. (I told you, I'm embarrassed) Add to this the fact that when it comes to \"Brazier\" all you can get is a hot dog swimming in funky hot dog water and there's little to no reason for me to stop here anymore.   I want to take this opportunity to apologize to Michael's, Culver's and most of all Kopps in Milwaukee. I'll never stray again. You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Lady needs hearing aids which I had to repeat my order many times too.i wish they would fix the workers or some that are younger than others."}
{"text":"(4/16/17) Trayvon greeted us as we came in the door. Answered questions we had about what was in blizzards. He's very knowledgeable about the menu. I like that. Lots of times people have to go ask a manager if you ask questions about the menu items. We've been in here several times. This is the cleanest DQ I've ever been in. Very speedy service. The cup sizes, etc are displayed.  Love the service we get when we come in. Definitely recommend! A++"}
{"text":"One of the cleaniest restaurants I've ever been in. Every time I'm there the staff is very friendly. Order fast.Restrooms super clean. Nice patio area outside (for cooler days). All the other DQs should be trained by this location's staff. Other locations just don't measure up. Keep up the good work! Your crew are restaurant rockstars!"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen is conveniently located close to the hotel I usually stay at.  It can be easy to miss as it's part of a strip mall and isn't very big.  After dinner, we decided to have mini blizzards ($3.99 each) for dessert.  It's a better value to get a bigger size but after a meal, a mini is really all you need.  There weren't many people in the line so we were served fairly quickly.  The blizzards were made soon after the order placed.  I had the Oreo blizzard and I would have liked more Oreo pieces but it was a good treat.  I probably wouldn't sit in this restaurant to eat but bring it back to the hotel to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant, all my food was great, ice cream was perfect. Each time I have gone in since the opening I've had nothing but a great experience and amazing service. WILL DEFINITELY KEEP COMING!! (they have earned themselves a loyal customer). I do highly recommend citizens of each state if you visit or if you are just a local to come try the food at this establishment."}
{"text":"Been here twice and last time we went here for my mom because she's gluten intolerant and can't have normal hard ice cream so her favorite is Dairy Queen! All around the staff here was super nice and we received our food efficiently. It is a bit weird that their ice cream sundaes do not have a cherry on top but my mom was fine with that. I'm not a huge fan of ice cream so I order their soft pretzel sticks. If you order them through the drive through like we had on a different visit, they have you park in the parking lot and they bring it out to you. I thought that was nice of them not making you go in yourself to get them or hold up the drive through line.  If you order the pretzel sticks inside then they simply bring them to your booth, also very convenient but keep in mind you'll get them maybe 5-7 minutes after everyone has their ice cream. I love them! I think they taste great and they come out warm although I don't use the dipping sauce cause I'm not into \"zesty\" too much. I will definitely go again for some more of those pretzels!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Lisa K.  This Dairy Queen is excellent.  I had a coupon for a free Blizzard and this is the closest one to my home so off we went.  This one is located in the strip mall where Phoenix Palace Buffet is on Dobson.  It's kind of tucked away next to a Yoga studio in the corner.  We were warmly greeted the minute we walked in and served quickly.  My daughter told the woman that her birthday was coming up and she instantly put her on a list for a free birthday blizzard.  Nice!  We all know Blizzards are full of fat and sugar but the darn things are so good, who can resist!!  I tried the Pumpkin Pie Blizzard and it was delish!!  I love all things pumpkin though so if that's not your thing, my daughter had the cookie dough and she gave it two thumbs up!!  She said there were big chunks of cookie dough in it and that was a-ok in her book!  It's nice when you get great service at a little fast food joint.  Usually that's not the case.  Kudos to this one for being different in a good way!"}
{"text":"Its pretty cool to get ice cream at a drive thru, but you had better be ready with your order when you pull up or they treat you like an asshole. Yes, I know how it works, but when there are 60 ways to get any of their 30 items, sometimes I need a little time to sort out exactly what I want to give you money to serve me."}
{"text":"Besides walking in and having the whole place smell like a dirty bathroom- when I ordered my blizzard I was told that they were out of cookie dough. You're freaking Dairy Queen! How do you run out of cookie dough?!? In light of the smell and not having what I wanted, I decided not to get anything. In any case, I think I'll drive a little further to go to the South Durango or West Sahara locations and avoid this location at all cost."}
{"text":"So there was barely any mint in my blizzard and uhm I guess I was due to wait in line for how many minutes.. That doesn't make me as a paying patron want to come back.. I will just say that maybe the Black gentleman was having a bad day..  I only gave it a extra star because the other guy was pleasant and extended a greeting..  I would rather drive farther and find another location.."}
{"text":"I love a good chocolate malt shake, and theirs is awesome!"}
{"text":"Mostly dirty and unwelcoming. Staff isn't friendly. Witnessed a customer bring a cone they had ordered outside and back in. Employee took cone from customer, dipped it, then gave it back. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I can't speak for their deserts, but this place knows how to grill up some burgers! The mushroom swiss is seriously too good for a fast food place. Just the thought makes my cholesterol levels go up 20 points!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever.  Took over over 30 minutes to get through their drive thru.  It was pathetic.  If I didn't know any better, I would think they were making the ice cream from scratch.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"When I was little, my best friend and I used to borrow money from the crosswalk lady to buy a Dilly bar at this Dairy Queen location.  We'd always tell her we'd pay her back, but we never did.  Poor crosswalk lady.  Why she would actually give us the money, I'll never know, but she did help to instill in me a fondness for the Queen that just won't go away.  I know most DQ's are a little ghetto, but there's not much better than a mud pie blizzard and that's just the plain truth.  This location is tiny. And a little dirty looking. But it brings back old childhood memories. So whenever I'm near it, I stop by and get an ice cream, and I think you should too."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative rating, I would.  This place doesn't deserve stars. It deserves a big middle finger. The employees in this place ignore the customers. Kids today are not too bright. I don't think they realize where their paychecks come from. But what do they care working for minimum wage? When I was younger I worked fast food and I learned good customer service at that job because no matter how little money I made I took pride in what I did. I hate to sound like an old fuddy duddy but kids these days have no manners or any idea what courtesy is all about. And that's why good customer service is becoming so scarce. Parents don't teach their kids these values anymore and it comes out in the service industry from kids who walk around with this sense of entitlement.   Anyway, go to this DQ if you want to watch a bunch of sour puss teen agers ignore you; if you actually want dessert try Cold Stone or Baskin Robbins."}
{"text":"On 03/09/2017 at approximately 7:15 i went to this establishment. I ordered a banana split. I have no clue what it is they gave me . It looks melted . Some one needs to re train these people.  This place was great now its just trash..TRASH"}
{"text":"*e**ome *o *airy **een *hat ca* I **t *ou?  Hello?  **s?  Can you hear me?  I **n ***r yo*.  Ok, can I have 2 small twist cones, dipped please.  **pped, **ist?  Yes.  ***ll?  What?  ***ll?  Yes.  And a small chocolate cone.  ***col*te **ne?  Yes.  ***ase *ull to **ndow.  Standard quality DQ soft-serve here.  Drive-up speaker needs some help though."}
{"text":"The new owners have placed a code lock on the washrooms, which is already insulting, but they're of such low quality that half the time they don't open even if you enter the correct code. There are other DQ locations nearby that offer better service and better-quality food; do yourself a favour and go to one of them."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty overpriced. My favorite thing here is the orange julius. At least buy that if you're going to visit Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"The bead to my sandwich is all soggy, even on the outside. It's grossing me out. I can't even finish it. We order two large blizzards for our to-go order and they were level with the cups with no lids and no toppings  when I asked for lids and toppings she gave me drink covers"}
{"text":"I've been calling DQ to make a Birthday cake order for my husbands birthday and no one answers the phone and the particular store only does the cake orders for n store not online. Very disappointing. Not going to this location again. Didn't mean to give them a star the deserve 0 stars."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in tonight for a blizzard. To be fair there was a long line. I just rolled with it and placed my order. 15 minutes later I got to the window. My Blizzard had been sitting there for I assume at least the last 10 minutes. It was served upside down. However 5 minutes later I have to put it in my freezer so it can re solidify. Not a good thing to have to re freeze your ice cream."}
{"text":"I decided to come here during my lunch break, and it was a big mistake... the location is very convenient because how close it is but I will not be returning. Soda was going flat, burger was sloppy, buns were flattened like sliced bread and it was barely warm after a 3 minute drive. Also their fries were unbearably soggy and over salted... I've worked fast food before and at a Dairy Queen Grill before, it doesn't take much time or effort to keep a meal hot."}
{"text":"Only giving one star cuz I have to. Terrible service, food wasn't hot or fresh, took over 10 minutes to get a #1 combo. Would definitely would rather go to Freddie's. Watched two separate employees wipe tables down and drop the same rag on the floor to wipe the floor with their shoes! Once I got my burger it was burnt to a crisp. Didn't serve my blizzard upside down. Overall terrible establishment and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed coming into DQ. The ice cream is always delicious and the food is pretty good.   The service was great. Got a friendly greeting going in and was promptly served. The young lady was very friendly and polite.   Ordered the #2 Flamethrower burger combo, it was nice and hot getting to my table. The fries were piping hot and crispy. It was a very good lunch.  I'll look forward to returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow drive thru. Gave me wrong order and since I paid for it I drove back through to wait again in the drive line to get the right order. I won't be back, sonic is down the street and cheaper!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite DQ! They make the best blizzards, always well blended with lots of cookies, candy, etc. We are regulars here and the staff goes out of their way to give us a great experience!"}
{"text":"No Veterans discount even though there's a big ole sign saying they give one to our active military and Veterans. No where on that sign does it say \" except on certain items\". Two thumbs down on this dairy queen."}
{"text":"This is the BEST DQ for Blizzards!  We constantly compare them from DQ to DQ on our travels.  And I LOVE the iced tea!  We frequent at least once a week.  The owners are not the same owners from a previous review.  The place is clean and the staff helpful and friendly, remembering my requests for sweetener for my iced tea!  We are so lucky to have this in St. Joseph!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a Blizzard. Finally went to the window and they had put it in the freezer. I was sitting in plain sight with their number on the table."}
{"text":"As an alumni of the greatest Dairy Queen ever (RIP Pritchard's DQ, Mentor on the lake Ohio) I know what makes a good DQ. This location is as close as you get to my former employers awesome franchise. It is clean and friendly and I've never had an excessive wait.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In between 11 an 4  you can get a cheeseburger, fries, a drink and a sundae for 5 dollars. 2 people could easily split this meal. I personally have not had a problem with the service and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick cone for the kiddo. No adults in sight, and the clatch of teenaged girls and one boy were busy ignoring us initially (we were the only customers in line). Finally got the order, and somehow they were able to screw up a simple chocolate dipped cone. Hold it in the hot sauce long enough and yep - the ice cream inside melts and makes an immediate mess. We took it to go, and it got tossed in less than 5 minutes.  Ugh...good job, owner or manager. Staff the place with kids that couldn't care less."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this no stars. This is a fast food place, everyone knows that. The food is expected to be low quality. But the service should at least be decent. Every time I have been here in the past two years the service has been humorous. When I'm given an attitude as though I am disturbing the teens inside who are at work, none the less, I am turned off. It's been hard to not drive threw and order just to throw it on their windows. All I'm asking for is some common courtesy and manners. Without customers YOU wouldn't have a job. I now drive to the mall nearby when I'm wanting a quick dairy queen fix. Which means no drive through and five extra miles. At least the service is a bit better."}
{"text":"I popped in for an Orange Julius smoothie.  The employee was busy by herself and was blending someone else's drink and dessert, but she never acknowledged me that there would be a wait...so I just kind of stood around there.  But after she was finished with their order, she took my order and the guy behind me, and the smoothie came out pretty quick.  Not too much wait at all, after the order anyways.  I think they just understaffed at that particular time of day, but then again, the rest of the reviews aren't much different or worse than mine, so maybe it's more than that."}
{"text":"Mmmm.  Milk butterfat + candy.  The Blizzard is one of the great American inventions.  Nice kids staffing the place, marginally clean store, and they have soft-serve ice cream with peanut butter cups and M&Ms.    I think my pregnant wife would singlehandedly keep them in business.  It's also one of the few things our little girl will offer to spend her own money on if we can go. :o)"}
{"text":"I use to like going here but last saturday was enough. I meam yea, it was busy but at least they could've had someone at the register. I went there and when i got inside wad poor service and no one at the register. As I order the chicken strip basket it barely had any fries or gravy. I use to order here and the chicken strip basket had plenty of chicken, gravy and fries. I mean paying more for a basket with less food? Also the service was crappy too. Not going to go here again until they improve their customer service."}
{"text":"5 Stars for what it is...Dairy Queen! Who doesn't like a Blizzard? Fast and Yummy. In and out with a Blizzard Meal Deal. I was spoon fed a Hawaiian Blizzard on the drive home...it doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say there is anything particularly outstanding about this Dairy Queen, but there certainly isn't anything negative to report, either. It's a small location with very limited seating. I almost always go through the Drive Thru, although I've also dined in on several occasions. The inside is clean and the staff is generally upbeat. My food is usually delivered in a timely manner, and as expected. The non-ice cream menu is pretty thin, but I only go to DQ for dessert.  I have no complaints about this location after numerous visits."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh...it's Dairy Queen.  It is just ok.  I had a hotdog and a sundae one day for lunch and it was decent. I wouldn't crave it or go out of my way to get it, but it was a $5 meal...can't beat it.   The service was a little slow on a weekday around lunch time.  It was not crowded.  I'm not sure what the hold up was, but overall it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"This store is not normally like this but I was stuck in the drive thru at 1:30pm on a Monday for 13 min. No cars moving. No explanation or apology for the delay.  If someone order is a problem, move them to a parking spot. It was unprofessional."}
{"text":"The man who helped us at the window showed no sign of enthusiasm and was rude to my gf but was quick to serving us"}
{"text":"Just tried out this dairy queen. Nice inside, the cashier was friendly and my order came out quick. Ill visit again and again anytime I'm in this area."}
{"text":"I had a worker named Isabelle flip my Blizzard and she did a great job, she was super friendly and it was great!"}
{"text":"This is a five star Dairy Queen do you want to bring the kids do you wanna watch the game do you wanna sit and watch the news very new very clean very nice staff ! !  I happen to be walking and got fish sandwich & bottled water - so nice in here- Bring the kids,  nieces & nephews & still get game on tv !!"}
{"text":"Hmm, plain and simple to describe this place.. DISGUSTING. each employee looks disgruntled to the max, they do an excellent job at ignoring their customers. They get confused with drive-thru and eat-in orders, like giving out your order to a drive-thru or vice versa. Walked into the restroom only to find blood all over the sink, counter and floor. The employee's response was \"oh we had a guy on meth in there earlier, sorry\"... I change my mind, disgusting is to say the least."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I dunno, the Oreo Brownie Earthquake is passable for those dinners where dessert isn't much of an option (see my review of Osaka, which is where we were before hitting DQ). The fudgy bricks are soft, the ice cream is creamy and cold, and everything tastes processed, but you don't mind since you just had to have something after your meal of tempura snapper and tea smoked duck. DQ, I used to love ya as a kid. Now, I just kinda like ya or rather, tolerate ya.   P.S. This location also sells Orange Julius products."}
{"text":"Good old DQ. After our pizza dinner, the ladyfriend wanted ice cream, so we stopped at this Dairy Queen that I often forget exists.   If there's a case to be made for soft serve ice cream, let DQ testify. It's just a creamy, smooth trip to Heaven, especially when it comes in the form of...an Oreo Brownie Earthquake. Oreo chunks, a soft brownie, hot fudge which I scoop from the bottom of the cup, marsmallow, and whipped cream can take something that is processed and taken for granted and make it near-legendary.    I marvel at how their ice cream pours out of the machine in those mounds with the Curly Q at the top.   I also dig how all their equipment whirrs and whines as if they're buildin' cars back in there. The whirrin' + the whinin' + the sweet scents + the slight chill of the place = a hankerin' for cones and sundaes.  That Blizzard machine frickin' quivers!    Psst. The Blizzard (I almost got one) turns 25 this year. Geez, it still seems new, don't it? I also keep forgetting about their Brazier selections (burgers, fries, dogs, etc.).  I don't recall ever being too keen on that end of their menu though, but it's been a while, so I'll refrain from bagging on it.   The service rocked too. After finishing my sundae, I had forgotten how thirsty ice cream makes me, so I went back up to the counter to get a small drink. I wanted something more refreshing that soda pop, so the manager recommended fruit punch. I pulled out my debit card, and the manager tells me it's on the house. \"Hon, I ain't makin' ya use yer card for that. Forget abaht it.\"   Veddy cool."}
{"text":"Note: This Dairy Queen also serves Orange Julius products.  And thank God for that, because we were thirsty walkin' 'round South Park in this heat!   We each got the classic Orange Julius, which hits the spot on a hellbound scorcher of a day.   I haven't had one in 20 years, and that was at Century III Mall. No shit. And now I want one every Sunday morning to wash down a farmer's breakfast. What a way to get yer Vitamin C."}
{"text":"Went here Monday night. The store was dirty. Ordered a Butternut Blizzard. Only two kids working. People were standing all over the dinning room waiting for orders. When the girl gave me my Blizzard,  she literally threw it at me.  I asked for a lid and she walked away. I stood at the counter til she returned. She loudly said \"what's the matter\". I again asked her for a lid. Her response was we don't have any and then took the next order and dismissed me. I asked for a manager and was told none was available. Again being ignored. The Blizzard didn't have much flavor. After a couple of bites I threw it in the trash. Waste of $6.00. First time in many years and will be my last. Hire a couple of high school kids that don't care with no supervision. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"Kids love it, so that's what's important. And it's always clean. But que is annoying, crowded and service is slow, and staff always seem overwhelmed. Looking forward to them solving this."}
{"text":"4 Stars because of the service from Marley. I have been to this location a few times just for ice cream, and she has excellent customer service skills. The location is not in the best of locations, but it is newer and the product has been correct on each visit."}
{"text":"Came in the other night, and I kind of knew what I was getting myself into. Night time during the middle of summer? Of course it's going to be packed. Unfortunately they were severely understaffed, just one girl working the counter and the other one making the frozen treats. Girl ringing everyone up, really sweet and professional. She was apologetic for having to step away to help make things. I told her not to worry. The girl making the treats- holy crap. The first thing she says in my direction is- get out of here. Go home. Don't you see how busy we are ? I was shocked. Then I realized she was talking to the girl in front of me who had just gotten off her shift at McDonalds (uniform was still on). I presume they are sisters. They start arguing which makes it even more uncomfortable. At this point you can here the girl slamming the things she's making down. Have you no tact? The entire line looked just as shocked as I did. 3 stars because I understand the wait and my blizzards always turn out just fine."}
{"text":"Manager Kim was very pleasant and courteous. I purchased an Oreo cookie and m&m log roll birthday cake for my husband and we are very pleased with the cake and the service. Thank you ! Highly recommended business."}
{"text":"Went for the $5 boxes and found them disappointing.  You get what you pay for I guess.  Even worse was seeing how they make the food.  Cook your burger on the flat top then pop it in the microwave.  Plus the guy actually cooking never washed his hands once in the at least 30 some minutes we've been here.  This is after he went and removed a cone from the bathroom.  So GROSS!!   Immediately went back and pulled a raw burger out of the fridge with the same hand.  Only time I saw him with gloves on is when he was cutting onions."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've came to this location and the equipment has been broken and I've not been able to order what I wanted. There is an overwhelming smell dirty fry oil, I was in there 2 minutes after not being able to get an Orange Julius not being able to get a latte and not be able to get an ice cream cone and I smell like fried food. Yuck!!!!! I am assuming they have a cheap owner who is not willing to fix equipment, being it is always broken. Even though it's a convenient location I will be coming back.....STAY AWAY...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"}
{"text":"We were able to get what we wanted here which was nice... The staff was friendly and the food was good the restaurant was clean... the only reason you got a 3 and not a 4 was the stench of dirty fry oil....   When I wrote the first part of this review I was in the restaurant... I gave a three star, I bumped it up to 4 star due to the customer service..."}
{"text":"Very clean inside.  They even decorated for Halloween!  Ordered Blizzards and chocolate dipped cones.  Asked for a chocolate dipped cone but was given a vanilla cone instead.  The error was corrected without any issues.  Food was good.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would this place is horrible. Every time I come something goes wrong. First they never have the personal cupcakes available. What a joke what kid doesn't enjoy a personal ice cream cake every now and again.. They have given me a burger with no burger patty!!! By far the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Great service. The server was pleasant and courteous. Delicious! Nice clean location in centennial hills."}
{"text":"It's good.  I've eaten there once and was surprised it's clean.  About 8 years ago I ate at a Dairy Queen in the state of Washington that was quite dirty.  I wish they had more eating area."}
{"text":"This is the DQ that I always go to. It's an older one so no indoor seating, but he staff is always courteous and pretty prompt. There is seating outside. Additionally, there is a miniature golf course and a driving range so you can make a night of of it.   They also have daily specials."}
{"text":"For some reason this DQ is more expensive than others in the area and gives smaller portions. I asked about it at the drive through window and the cashier did acknowledge that the other locations have different sized cups. Weird.   It has a drive thru, but it is a bit tricky to maneuver and it's always packed. The inside area is nice."}
{"text":"Who does not love a DQ Blizzard? And I heart the Girl Scout Thin Mint Blizzard. Next time, I will get the mini size. The small filled me up before I finished!"}
{"text":"We went here on a lunch break one day just to get dessert.  Little did we know that after ordering a malt and a shake, we would wait in the drive through for literally 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes into it, we started looking for escape routes.  Just as I was about to back up a bit and sneak around, another car boxed us in.  Its not like they had a huge line either.  That 15 minutes was spent second in line.  They didn't get anyone through.  I cannot speak to the quality of their particular chocolate desserts since we just peaced out.  We ran out of time waiting for them.  Next time we'll go to smashburger just down the road."}
{"text":"Ordered two small cones. I have waited 20 mins now. No one here can multi task. There is not good follow thru with the orders. I'm now late to my next appointment. This crew needs to get it together. Wow."}
{"text":"I like this location.  They're right by my house, so it is very convenient.    The staff have always been polite, and have never messed up an order. :D"}
{"text":"My order was placed in the drive thru so did not taste the blizzard til I got home.  I ordered the pumpkin pie blizzard and it was horrible.  I have been getting them for years so I know what they are suppose to taste like.  There was way too much pumpkin and the bottom half wasn't blended at all.  Ended up throwing it away in the trash.  I placed a call to the DQ and got a message machine.  I hope management does the right thing and gets back to me."}
{"text":"We should have checked Yelp before heading out to this DQ. The husband and I were scheming about the hungerbuster burgers we were going to get and were getting all hyped up. We pull up only to find this DQ is NOT in fact a Dairy Queen. It's a glorified snack shack with Dariy Queen icecream. They literally only have a deep fryer. No grill. No burgers. WTF. This location sickens me. Don't call yourself a Dairy Queen and NOT carry the hamburgers. It's false advertising."}
{"text":"When my order was wrong April did awesome with helping me out! She not only got me my right order and did yet quick but she got me a punch card! It was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place needs a major overhaul on staff & training! I can't begin to count the number of times i've had bad service, attitude and poor quality products from them.  Any time we order our frozen Misty's, they are SO cheap with the syrup that if i don't ask for a little extra, i'm drinking ice water. Their answer is - you have to pay. No, i don't if you just make it the right way! Blizzards they are cheap with the toppings and usually 1/4 of the cup is just plain ice cream. We've stopped going after being regulars for 5 years. I'm getting a little tired of having to accept sub par food & quality. If you can't provide customers food as advertised on your website, in store & promos then don't make it! Otherwise that's false advertising. Seeing it too many times now and many different restaurants etc."}
{"text":"I felt like i was getting ignored when i walked in since no one wanted to help me. found someones hair in my ice cream and fries. Would not ever go back"}
{"text":"There's something about Diary Queen because everyone of them that is outside is always packed. I mean damn. it reminds of you of old school days of drive ins. The fella at the window made my Blizzard just how I asked him too it was really good. the only down side its really designed to get your ice cream and go. though we sat in the parking lot and ate it was a small space. we were probably blocking ppl from pulling in I'm sure. Overall it was a good experience I'm not oppose to dairy Queen now though I'm a Baskin Robins girl."}
{"text":"Very friendly drive-thru staff who went above and beyond. It was nice to see employees hard at work during a slow period (cleaning food prep stations, etc.) instead of goofing off or chatting.  And of course, the desserts at DQ are always amazing! Blizzards and Peanut Buster Parfaits are the best!"}
{"text":"I'm a customer and I love the Dairy Queen Steven was excellent at his job he was very busy on the 17th 2018 he took care of customers very well !! Working the register taken care of Customer's running orders all with a smile and a great attitude it was very very busy in there and he did an amazing job Steven is the best!!! I even tipped him $10 because he was awesome you guys are always doing the orders the correct way I never have found another Dairy Queen that can make a cherry blizzard like I like and you guys do PUP cups for the dogs I think that's great my dogs are my kids me and my husband we go there often and we love to come back all the time thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Its a hot Saturday night and the GF and have spent the afternoon and evening at the Stampede.  Whats a good way to wrap things up?  Well a cold sweet sundae of course.  So with that in mind we thought we'd stop at the Country Hills Dairy Queen.  Sadly they were closed.  Now I could understand if it was past midnight or in the middle of November but no, this was 10:30pm in July.  What the hell?  Hot Saturday nights are made for ice cream so for the life of me I can't imagine why they wouldn't be open."}
{"text":"Love this place, the staff is friendly ... although mostly in high school.  My family frequents this location and they will provide 'special orders' upon request.  For example my uncle wanted a 'mini' peanut buster parfait and they accommodated. I think the prices and cleanliness are equal to other DQ's I have visited.  They also have 'give back' nights for local schools for fundraising."}
{"text":"I started going to this location shortly after they opened a few months ago. In the beginning, the service was very good and the burgers were awesome.   In the last month or so I've definitely noticed a sharp decline in both food quality and the service. First off, the service has gotten really bad. I normally go to the drive thru and you're lucky if you get your order right. Usually they forget something or you get the wrong order all together.   The other thing is the food quality. As far as the burgers go, they use to be fresh and awesome, but the past 3 times I've had them they have been obviously pre made and microwaved before serving to me. You only get that 500 degree burger all wet and mushy texture from a microwave.  I won't be back at this location until they get things back on track."}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience. I have been going to this dairy queen for years and I cannot belive what has happened to it. It was awful, the food, service and ice cream. Let me start from the beginning. We got there about 7:45pm, upon entry we saw several angry customers waiting for their orders to be corrected. That should have been a big red flag right there, but we were hungry and decided to go ahead and order since we'd never had a bad experience in the past. Big Mistake! So we placed our order, consisting of a chicken bacon ranch sandwich, a 4pc chicken strips, 2 orders of onion rings, and 2 sm blizzards (pumpkin pie and a salted caramel truffle). We found a seat in the corner away from the obviously sick people sitting at the front and waited for our food. Shortly our blizzards arrive, the pumpkin pie one was missing its nutmeg topping, so the guy took it back, but returned saying they were out of nutmeg. I was not told this when I ordered it and would have affected my choice. He then took our number away even though we had yet to receive our food items. So we waited, and then saw what appeared to be our order delivered to the table with the sick people. I guess the guy had given them our order number without completing our order first. Once he realized his mistake he took it from them and gave it to us. I was worried but we decided to try to eat it anyway. Now onto the meal itself. Half my chicken tenders were tough and inedible, while the onion rings were flavorless. My husbands sandwich was disgusting, with pressed chicken and bacon that tasted as if it had been soaked in cleaning solution, he didn't even get through half of it. His blizzard was okay but mine lacked pumpkin flavor on top of the missing topping. Very unlike pumpkin pie blizzards I have had at other locations. This was one of the main reasons we went there today.  Over all we were very disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Okay, it's only Dairy Queen, but the husband wanted ice cream, we saw the DQ and acquiesced. We both ordered Heath Blizzards and for less than $4 I had a delicious Saturday afternoon snack. I hadn't had a Blizzard in over 10 years and it tasted just like I remember it.  The best in the world, no. Pretty darn good for four bucks, you betcha. This location is pretty clean and they offer a lot of different options. Probably won't make a special trip back, but if you're in the neighborhood give them a try."}
{"text":"Just ordered a peanut butter cup blizzard and there was VERY little in it but ice cream. What a rip off! I would think they would have to follow an established list of ingredients but not so in Savoy. The DQ in Monticello is great with lots of mix ins in their blizzards."}
{"text":"Store opened a few days ago and it's still pretty busy. Drive through and inside. The building is brand new as is the equipment and furniture. Staff is friendly and the blizzards tasted fresh. The wait was a little longer than usual for the amount of customers ahead of us. I ordered the Royal Choco Blizzard (brownie pieces). My girl ordered a cherry dipped cone and her mom an Orange Julius. They also tasted fresh and delicious. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, decent location, and the sweets are awesome. They have ice cream cakes and other sweets available to take home, too. This location is also clean."}
{"text":"I hate coming here...yet I am a sucker for punishment. It's 50/50 for service and food quality. I ordered a Royal Oreo Blizzard today and specifically asked the employee if it was a Royal Oreo and not a plain Oreo. She looked confused and nodded her head. Turns out it was just a plain Oreo. I had to return to the location to exchange the Blizzard. Why can't customers ever get exactly what they order at the quality we are promised? They gave me the correct flavor but the Blizzard had ONE chunk of fudge at the top and nothing else. What a rip! Close this location down. Build a Cold Stone Creamery or a  better franchise."}
{"text":"Wanted some ice cream and went through the drive thru. There were a lot of cars in line but it moved quickly. I ordered a mini banana split blizzard and had a gift card to use. Blizzard was good, but it wasn't mixed well enough. The mix-ins were pretty much in the top half and the bottom half was essentially plain soft serve. In my experience, DQ employees tend not to be the most customer service-oriented."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a mini Blizzard after realizing Sonic's minis are double the calories (no kidding)! I went with the Strawberry Cheesecake blizzard. So yummy. The person behind the counter was there the last time we came and she seems to be nice and competent. 4 stars for DQ!"}
{"text":"Unusually love a Dairy Queen burger. When I got here it took a while to get my order. I ordered the $6 lunch deal with a double burger fry's drink and sundae. It took a while. The first bag I got wasn't my order. Them when I finally got my order the burger was bland and not hot. Bummer. When I went to the bathroom it was clean but there aren't any doors on the stalls. Kind of weird but I guess they've had problems with vandals. The guy at the counter wasn't very personable either. Oh well. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"The family and I have been here numerous times and usually get a Julius.   They are always exactly how we order.  II have actually never been inside but we have never waited long in the drive through.  As far as serving blizzards upside down.  WHO CARES!  They always do it and my opinion its dumb.  We got the royal blizzards recently and they were awesome even flipped upside down."}
{"text":"Created my kids crazy custom Blizzards. The food was good here too. Customer service is top level every time I come here. I read some of the complaints about a burger not being the best, but I think it was just as good as McDonald's and DQ is more about the ice cream than the burgers."}
{"text":"I really keep coming back to this place trying to like it and they constantly disappoint. The food is usually fresh, that's not the problem. If you dare ask for your ice cream that comes with the meal after you receive your meal it's inconvenient for them and you end up waiting. The soda machines are constantly not working which makes it a little hard if you don't want tea. In all honesty it's the workers here that put this place down. Apart from one gentlemen (who is white and younger) everyone seems like they hate their job and don't want to be there. I've never seen any manager managing these people. It's truly sad to watch a bunch of kids ruin experiences constant. I wish they would invest in some better employees in order to make this place better. You really can't beat the $5 lunch but when it comes with inability to drink and endless hassling it's maybe not worth it."}
{"text":"Oldest DQ in AZ . I love it ,please don't remodel. Delicious handcrafted Blizzards. The only DQ that still makes Hawaiian Blizzards. Awesome old school DQ!"}
{"text":"Just finished up dinner and skipped on the dessert menu to fill in my hankering for some DQ. I have a shovel in my trunk and I'm ready to take on a Blizzard.   This is the third time I'm trying out this DQ. The ice cream is obviously great it's DQ but the service is horrible. I always get a large blizzard with M&Ms and Oreos and not once have they flipped it. According to DQs commercials I should have received a free blizzard every time. I don't even bother telling them because they seem annoyed with me the second I order and \"ain't no body got time for that\". They fill in my sweet tooth but leave a cold spot in my heart."}
{"text":"Small dairy queen that meets the needs, ask for malts extra think and enjoy"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst DQ we have ever been to.  They are very haphazard in portions, sometimes we get Hot fudge on the sundae and sometimes there is hardly any.  If we ask for more, or ask them to portion it as it is supposed to be portioned, they are quite put out. The doors to and from the place are dangerous to say the least.  One opens into the drive thru lane, very dangerous.  The other side door also is squeezed between the drive thru cars and building.  Not clean, and the soft serve is not as creamy as other DQ's."}
{"text":"Very nice!  great staff, the soft serve is excellent, they just remodeled and it is clean and comfortable.  The manager is so willing to make things right for you.  Well done. There is no comparison to the others in the city, they far exceed them."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience i have ever had. I am so sad I love DQ.  Waited for my food after going thru drive thru.  Decided to just ask for money back and girl Ended up lecturing me and ranting on I tried to get her to stop and just give me money back but she would not stop ranting. Finally Told yer that was enough to hush.  She then yelled at me SHE was human how dare I treat HER like that    It was surreal.  Manager came returned my money and she apologized. I was dumbfounded by the whole event.  Never again.  Complete floored by young ladies behavior."}
{"text":"Dear  Dairy Queen -  get a better system for your drive-thru... 30 minutes for seven cars is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Consistently good in my book. They make a mean shake and blizzard. It's Dairy Queen, and they deliver on what you would expect."}
{"text":"Its Dairy Queen and when its 106+ its your savior in the desert. Air Conditioning and Cold Yummly Blizzards. Friendly employees and this location even sells Hoover Dam Hats. They did run a floor cleaner while people were sitting down eating which was a little odd. But ok. And most DQ's put chocolate sauce in my Cookie Dough blizzard without asking but its ok. Still love this location."}
{"text":"Very young employees that keeps a real messy business. Soiled rags used to wipe cups, hands and cash register. I won't be back, don't feel safe with their food products....  YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.."}
{"text":"We were out and about and our kid wanted Dairy Queen. Because he is such a great kid and was patient during our running around, we gave in. This one was the closest to our location at the time.   We were very impressed with the employees!! They had such great attitudes and were super friendly AND efficient!! Our food was hot and fresh and delivered right to our tables! We asked for our Sundaes to be made after we ate our hot food. The dude was alert and asked us if we were ready for our sundaes when he saw that we were winding down to our last bites of food.  The bummer about this location is that they only have four tables for inside dining. There is an nice area outside, but it was just too hot today! Kudos to the employees at this location!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here a chicken basket and a burger . Everything took so long people in line behind me got their food before I did , said I was just waiting on fries way to long of a wait for that asked for sauce,  got NO SAUCE . Burger was cold and fries that took so long for were nasty , lady at window was horrible with customer service !"}
{"text":"We really like this location!!! Service is quick, friendly and the food is hot and fresh (or cold LOL)!!! The place is clean and comfy!! Kudos to the employees at this location!!"}
{"text":"I'm often out and about with small children, so restroom cleanliness in the establishments we frequent are quite important for my frequent urinators. This DQ had a restroom that made my stomach turn. The toilet was backed up, leaving us a nice surprise. The floors were very dirty, and the kicker was instead of a mounted soap dispenser it was stuck on its side to the paper towel dispenser.   The food was standard DQ food, service fair, however the place felt dirty enough that I wonder about their kitchen cleanliness. If they can't keep up with the guest side of the restaurant, I doubt the kitchen areas is up to standards either."}
{"text":"Today, my mother and I had an ice-cream at this location.  The portion size was so small.  I felt as if I had been cheated.  I wanted to talk to the manager but the only people in the store were two very young teenage boys.  I won't ever be going back to this store again."}
{"text":"I got here in a Friday evening at 840p. My mom lives her orange Julius but I was told they can't make it because it was about to close so she settled for a strawberry shake and I'm really upset DQ doesn't make snickers blizzards anymore. Every thing else was great."}
{"text":"The place has no air conditioning, the service was awful.  The place is dirty and smells bad, the employees aren't even clean.  It's a shame that this is the closest DQ to my new apartment, but my girlfriend and I will not be returning to this location.  The ice cream we both received was melted before we even received it, and the reeses in my blizzard were whole and not even broken or chunks.  I strongly suggest you go somewhere else, or go to Bahama Bucks which isn't very far."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business???? Guy pretends to not hear thru speaker so he doesn't have to do his job!!! Long ass wait to get order and weird ghetto ass drive thru."}
{"text":"You kids that don't really care. Every time I order ice cream here I end up having to wait and it's melted. Ordered 2 chicken box meals, they gave me one had to wait, toast is disgusting and every time whether it's busy or slow they'll mess up your order. Get the donut place behind them instead and head to canes before coming here you'll only end up disappointed. Learnt my lesson for the last time"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to have a quick break away from the house so I treated her for some ice cream. We showed up 30 minutes before the inside closes and the girl who was a cashier and was cleaning up stated that we couldnt eat in there because they were prepping to close. Slightly annoyed, we settled for eating in the car. They botched up one of our orders. Asked for the original banana split with extra peanuts and extra whip. No fruits just some syrup and small amount of whip and peanuts. It wasnt busy so not sure how they managed to do that. Seemed to be ran by high schoolers. One guy was walking back and forth on his phone the whole time in the back of the house. The girl who made our ice cream was more concerned with talking to her employees than getting the ice cream orders right. Overall we didnt wait wrong and we love ice cream so only 3 stars."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is one of the newer venues to move into Town Square. This small shop is cramp on the inside with a few tables on the outside to enjoy your dessert.   When calories are not an issue and you just don't give a crap, a blizzard hits the spot. With a slew of mix ins to add to their vanilla base, you cannot go wrong. The mint Oreo or thin mint during girl scout season are my favorite. They have all the classics; banana splits, sundaes, cones, and dilly bars to satisfy everyone.  The employees in this location are nice. Nothing screams happiness more than ice cream, so I like to have friendly people serving me."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of most frozen treats. Dairy Queen is no exception. If I just don't care about calories, I am going through the drive through for a mint oreo blizzard. The kid in me cannot resist and they jam pack it with cookie goodness."}
{"text":"My mom wanted a soft serve banana split, what mama wants, mama gets.  I got a small peanut butter sundae, since  when is ice cream with a sauce called a sundae, shouldn't there be whipped cream? The offering of nuts maybe.  And small is really small. My husband's Guardian of the Galaxy blizzard was done to his liking, again a small should be labeled child's size. Now the most important item, the banana split hardly had any ice cream in it, it did have sauce and whipped cream, hallelujah but what a disappointment for the price. Now I remember why I never go to Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"This location has been here forever!  The staff is always friendly and their food... Yes they serve more than just blizzards,, is surpassingly good.  They always run promotions which are of very good value.  The parking situation may be a little tricky as there is a lot of foot traffic in the plaza.  With the weather slowly warning up, there will be more reason to come back for their goods"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great soft serve ice cream and a comfortable place to sit and chat, or a great ice cream birthday cake, Dairy Queen is the old comfortable, great-tasting fast food classic choice!   Blizzards are the best ice cream treat ever and you'll never get bored since so many combinations are great. A blizzard is a superior ice cream dessert. It's thick and packed with candy or chocolate or treats and they'll personalize it for you.   Same with a banana split. It's a little under seven dollars but so very good. You can choose three toppings for your three soft serve sundae treats. Options include hot fudge, strawberry, cherry, pineapple, chocolate and caramel. Strawberry is awesome. Caramel and hot fudge also totally delicious. Also the fries and burgers and chicken fingers .. all good!   The only things wrong with Dairy Queen is the way the staff are trained ... that could be better. The young cashier who made our banana split didn't use gloves when working with the banana, his fingers were all over it. It's a great place to sit and talk but it's not nice when an employee is mopping the floors with a dirty mop and you smell Lysol mingling with your food. They need to wait to clean like that for when customers are gone!   Otherwise, it's old school, it's good, tasty and comfortable. Cool treats and hot eats riiiight ?!!? Go for it, try it out again."}
{"text":"not reviewing the food - Dairy Queen food is what you expect it to be. Instead I am reviewing the service, such that it was,  All empty tables were uncleaned. We ordered one item which was forgotten about. When my roommate went to find out where his order went, staff ignored him until another customer (who was being waited on) pointed our how long be had been waiting at the counter, even with a manager standing there. Then, as if to punctuate our experience, the worker who finally helped my roommate dismissively remarked that she \"hadn't taken his order\", A friend who is familiar with this location was not surprised by my experience and stated that service is usually this bad."}
{"text":"This is an awful DQ. We ordered 5 blizzards. Every single one hardly had any think in them nor was it hardly mixed at all. We added items and was charged for them, but they did not make it in any of our blizzards. The staff was RUDE and unprofessional. When I had them remake mine, cause it clearly was not what I paid for, they gave me an attitude. I even said if you can show me 1 piece of banana that I paid for, then i wont have you remake it... of course they could not find anything. The fact that a paying customer has to try to justify that they did not get what they paid for is absurd. They were extremely slow and we were the only ones side. It took over 23 minutes to get 5 blizzards really?? These employees need be retrained on customer service and how to make their products correctly. I will not return to this DQ and will op to use another DQ in the future."}
{"text":"Always see the commercials but I don't live in a town that own one of these, so my BF and I decided to try it in Vegas. It definitely was great! We ordered, paid, got our drinks from the fountain, sat down, and poof...the kid was bringing our food to us. It was only a couple of minutes since we've sat down. It was so quick, I was worried at first. But surprisingly, the food was delicious, too hot to eat at first, and you could tell the chicken was real chicken. BF ordered the 6 piece chicken strips with fries, it was so good. For some reason, they gave us extra chicken strips, so definitely a winner! I ordered the chicken bacon ranch sandwich, also tasted great! We then both decided to share a Blizzard chocolate brownie, the kid turned it upside down and it was like they promised, no falling. It was satisfying! Overall, for a fast food place, we had a great experience! My BF says if there was one in our town, he would go all the time LOL and I believe him (:"}
{"text":"I think there ice cream machine is bad. I also think they need to teach there employee how to be respectful. The lady made my blizzard and then stood there with the window closed, knocking on it at me to look so she could tip it up side down. I mean really, she could not have opened the window and showed me but decided to knock at me. Cant say I have ever been knocked at."}
{"text":"Great service, fast, clean and friendly staff. Love that they have Belly at their store with great deals! The ice cream is always yummy and they have great food with affordable specials."}
{"text":"Stopped in for ice cream with my girlfriend. You can count I Dairy Queen for consistent quality. Both the banana split and Georgia mud fudge blizzard were good."}
{"text":"Gave this Dairy Queen multiple chances to change my perception. The employees are friendly enough, but the food is less than impressive if not down right gross. I advise anyone utilizing the drive thru, to verify the contents of their bags before driving away! There seems to be a wait even when there are very few customers. Hopefully, they improve with time, but this will be my last time patronizing this location."}
{"text":"I'm only giving three stars because the first time I went here the girl who helped me was super nice and went out of her way to make my order (I orders triple chocolate utopia) which isn't on the menu and 90% of Dairy Queen's here have never even heard of it.   Tonight gets 1 star. The dude looked at me like a deer caught in headlights and instead Of making me a simple sundae with the cocoa fudge I got a nasty half assed and sorry excuse for sundae."}
{"text":"I grew up on Dairy Queen... which is odd for someone born and raised in Mexico. But the DQ I grew up in was an eat-in, sit down sorta place that served all your regular frozen treats and footlongs/hotdogs, etc. But that DQ also sold hamburgers and Country Baskets (breaded sticks of steak that you dunked in a bucket of gelatinous white gravy, DELICIOUS) and other plates not found in normal DQ menus. I know that this isn't your typical DQ and but I'd never been to a throwback DQ like the one in Plaza-Midwood.  Everything was ok. Just ok. At first Becky and I were a bit confused as to where to order since there were people scattered throughout the windows in no discernible order. It seemed that there were only two crew members behind the glass. One, the guy, taking orders and the other, the girl, handing them out. So neither really noticed us when we stood there for a good five minutes trying to figure out where to order.  Finally, we just approached a random window and the guy came over. He was very nice, attentive and polite. He took our order and verified everything twice.  The girl, on the other hand, was kinda... unpleasant. Not that she was overly rude or anything. She would just randomly stick her hand out of the window with a product someone had ordered without any real expression on her face. As the guy was still taking our order, the girl stuck out her hand with a hand-dipped cone and said, \"hand-dipped cone\". I was standing right next to her and just kinda looked perplexed for a second not sure who she was talking to. I asked if it was ours and she just looked at me without saying anything. I confirmed with Becky that she'd order one. I looked back at the girl and asked, again, if it was ours as no one else was approaching the window to pick it up. She looked at me and, what  I perceived as almost, rudely, said, \"it's a hand-dipped cone...\" That didn't sit well with me at all. I grabbed it and thanked her. She simply walked away back into her cave of frozen wonders.  A few minutes later she comes out with with a bag that had my footlong and some bunched up napkins inside. She walks away again... a few seconds later the guy comes to the window with my soda. I wait a little longer as I've still not received my bag of chips. I leaned into the window again and ask the guy, since who knows where the chick's gone, for my chips. He quickly apologized and grabbed a bag. On his way to give them to me I overheard him, rather annoyed, ask the girl, \"you didn't put the chips in the bag?\" I'm not sure the girl responded. He apologized again and we were on our way.  The food was ok. My footlong had chili and cheese, ketchup and mustard. Pretty damn good. I was surprised that the bun actually held the whole thing together. It did not become a soaked, wadded mess that required morbid amounts of napkins just to get through. Never heard of the brand of chips they gave me but they were good enough.  Overall, the food was edible and a nice throwback. I will definitely go again. The only truly bad mark was the girl's crappy attitude."}
{"text":"Place is alright. The blizzards are really good, especially the Oreo one. I also love the French fries here. The service in the drive thru can be annoyingly slow sometimes but it's worth the wait when craving ice cream late at night."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. I've only been here once so far but I definitely will be returning when in need of ice cream. I had to wait about 15 minutes in a line in my car but once I finally got up to order the employees got my order right and I didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for them to get my order to me."}
{"text":"Staff here has a hard time understanding how to complete your order. I ordered a Blizzard for my son, he wanted two different items in it and cashier kept looking at me. Another employee had to come and figure out the problem. The time we went quite a few tables had not been cleaned. We found one of the more clean tables. The good thing is my kids enjoyed eating their ice cream and that was the reason for going. They were happy so overall it was worth going."}
{"text":"Yum! We ordered the 4 for $5 deal....nicely prepared sundaes and packed perfectly to go!  Craig Rd DQ is horrible!! This location is great! Going to try their burger/fries next time. :-)"}
{"text":"So went in the other night for some ice cream with the wife and kid. This place ac went out so it was hotter inside the outside on a 100 degree night. The oj squeezer was broke so that was not an option and then they where out of blondie cookies for the ice cream me and the wife ordered. It's like the place was falling apart I highly doubt I'll be back to this location. Had to take our ice cream to go and it wasnt even the ones we wanted but oh well."}
{"text":"Very good place for a quick lunch. As I forget to bring lunch box, I try 5 buckets lunch here today. Very satisfied. Cheap and ok with taste. DQ is very expensive in my homeland, but here is very cheap. I like it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for hipster gourmet ice cream..this isn't it, but if you are looking for something to satisfy a sweet tooth and maybe a walk down memory lane DQ is your best bet. I remember coming to this location a good bit growing up, so when I was driving by in 98 degree heat, I couldn't resist the urge to stop and get a blizzard.  This location is your typical chain set-up a few chairs and tables and a counter with friendly staff. Seeing as it is September, and I'm a basic white girl, I had to try the pumpkin pie blizzard. Personally I think the mini size is plenty of ice-cream, but if you really want more they have larger sizes. The pumpkin pie blizzard was pretty damn tasty, would use more pumpkin puree and less graham cracker, but for $2 who am I to complain?"}
{"text":"Very friendly at the drive-thru and an awesome Blizzard right around the corner from us. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Incompetent people working. Slow slow slow drive thru. How hard is it to work an ice cream machine? They also ran out of chocolate ice cream. Just said forget it and left."}
{"text":"Hit the drive thru around 8th on a Monday,  it was packed inside! Got a club type grilled sandwich. My bacon was spicy. ....which was odd. Their French fries aren't my favorite style. Overall for fast food, I was ok. Got a traditional banana split, that was rather skimpy on the toppings. Not many DQs around the valley, so it was a nice treat while staying in a hotel in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen? Or Dirty Queen? And I'm not talking about my femmy neighbor with the Member's Only jacket drenched in Patchouli. Really, it's not working. You're just stinky. But this DQ could use a visit from Mr. Clean and the Brawny paper towel guy. Both of whom I've had huge crushes on. Napkins, papers and spoons on the floor. Behind the counter wasn't a pretty picture either. They weren't busy and should have been cleaning. You know what they say...\"If there's time to lean, there's time to clean.\" However, my simple little vanilla cone really hit the spot. For that...2 stars. Staff was friendly. One more. Total. Three stars"}
{"text":"The tiny water cup was so funny. Place was clean and average fast food. You know what to expect. It was 3:00 so they were not busy. I had to go to 5 tables to find a ketchup bottle that wasn't empty. The employees were friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Yooooo this Dairy Queen is amazing day they be whipping that ice cream up better than Walter white whip up drugs in the lab they might as well be trapping ice cream in there. But that service didn't  feel like a drug deal ima be back and I can't wait  whip it up all in that Cocina shout my Mexican my people much love"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger combo, fries were for sure sitting out and then refríed because of how soggy and oily they were, gross."}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me how much DQ can charge for some frozen milk with some crushed up cookies mixed into it.  Nevertheless, this is a good location to get your frozen treats. Any time I've come into this location I've never had to wait long, maybe two people ahead of me max.   I've tried a variety of items here and the quality is always up to par. I find this location nice and handy after completing a marathon shopping trip at the nearby Costco when I need to cool my jets from pushing through the hordes of people."}
{"text":"It's a Dairy Queen. No surprises, negative or positive, regarding the food.   Service is friendly. The facilities are clean and well kept. The décor? Dairy Queen circa 1975, with 1980's high school cafeteria influences. Hard benches and chairs... not a great atmosphere in which to sit and linger. Perhaps it does have some retro appeal, but it is a little surprising that the owners have chosen not to upgrade the interior given their prime Scottsdale location.   No matter. As long as the ice cream is served cold and the employees remain welcoming, this Dairy Queen deserves its success."}
{"text":"Very slow service and everyone who worked there looked like they hated life. Not friendly or in any hurry to help customers. Witnessed an order mess up that was the fault of the employee yet when the customer came up to ask for the correct thing was then charged the difference even though it was not their fault. The manager did not handle the situation well.  You could tell the guy taking our order was fairly new and still learning which was fine but the manager was getting frustrated with him. Instead of trying to help and teach him she just took over angrily and had him step aside. Was not very friendly, helpful, or happy."}
{"text":"ummm, butterscotch and cherry dilly bars !!!!!!!!!!!  get some!!  boom!!!"}
{"text":"went to drive thru, Smh. Horrible customer service. The girl made a rude comment after I changed the size of my blizzard. So rude!!! If you don't like your job. LEAVEEEE!"}
{"text":"I totally understand the two star rating!  I'm LIVID and FUMING.  I ordered a peanut butter & hot fudge sundae with crunch coat.   After being hollered at via drive thru HUH HUH HUH three times I spoke louder and she told me we don't have crunch coat.  I asked then to have sprinkles with a little tiny bit or nuts to make it like crunch coat.  SO I pulled around as I pulled around I was almost struck by a car reversing I'm assuming cause there order was messed up.  I paid for my sundae which she grabbed my payment with her gloves on which is gross since she will still touch food with those money handling gloves and because the car in front of me had mistakes in the order I double checked mine and mine was wrong.  I had to beep my horn and knock on the window and kindly says mam I asked for peanut butter I was already a little annoyed I was charged for sprinkles AND nuts rather than since they are out of the crunch coat and it was 12 Spanish nuts just do half and half but then she handed the sundae back to be and just pumped peanut butter all on top of the sundae rather than make a new one and I was a little upset when she handed it to me like that cause I am an elite yelper wanted to take a photo but it looked awful.  Now is when I realize I also wasn't given napkins but it poured all over me when I opened it. And it's not like it melted. I parked on the lot to eat it.  Rather than remake the sundae she poured it to the brim and my pants and brand new BRAND NEW $90 nikes are stained!   And she was not happy me and the car in front of me both had issues!   This is awful!   I seriously am so angry.  I work so hard for my money and my pants are salvageable but I can't get the stain outta my shoes and I can't express how lazy and careless this women is and it's the STORE MANAGER.  If the owners are reading this I suggest u have secret shoppers go in and handle this.  The young man Brandon or Brando felt awful and offered me napkins and asked if there's anything he can do seeing me covered in product!   LIVID!  (Excuse errors I'm speaking texting this). But this is the type of employee who if a guest orders a burger no tomato and returns saying they're sorry but they are allergic to tomatoes this type of employee will go back and just pull the tomato off and give patron burger then then patron will die from an allergic reaction.  Just plan lazy!   She did not care at all it was dripping all over me!  I told her very frustrated \"you should made a new sundae to compensate that there was obviously no room for more sauce\" and she was furious I made that statement!   I would love compensation but will never get it judging by the 2 stars!  I almost wanna pay a homeless person struggling for money to picket outside with a sign I'm so mad how I was treated..."}
{"text":"Super slow drive thru.. I've went here a couple times because it's close to my house but both times they take such a long time to make anything it's surprising that the ice cream doesn't melt first..."}
{"text":"Came here to get a salad and they didn't have lettuce really? This particular restaurant has went down so I had to change my order and waited forever for the new order. So over this DQ!"}
{"text":"Yelp says this place is open u til 9:30pm... I got there with my kids and the individual that works there said the place  lose at 9pm."}
{"text":"It's hot out and you want Ice Cream but you also don't want to just eat bad. Well go to Dairy Queen! I am a fan of Dairy Queen. This particular location seems to be new or remodeled.   I ordered a turkey sandwich combo and got a french silk pie blizzard. The turkey club was just right and the fries were good. The blizzard was awesome. In the heat it hits the spot.  Service was good, food was good, and it was clean so I give 4 stars to this Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Believe it or not...  This was my first adult trip to a Dairy Queen. I was in no mood for any dairy at all. So I took a chance on the The Buffalo Chicken bake. It took a very long time. I had to wait for them to prepare it. But it was worth the wait.  It was really good. It was a wrap, nice and crispy. The chicken was tender and very spicy in a good way. There was also some cheese and a nice smoky flavor on there as well.  I specifically asked for \"light\" ice in my Coke. But I still got an entire cup of ice and about three or four sips of Coke. The prices were rather inflated.  For those two items I believe I paid nearly $5. With no fries or anything.  I still have to say that the service was very friendly. But equally as slow. So I have given them a fair and rather generous three out of five star rating...   They have a wonderful community involvement outreach at this location.  And if I'm ever in the area again I'd probably stop there."}
{"text":"So....a new Dairy Queen just opened up in Surprise.  Score!  I made my way down here today to check out the new digs!  Everything was brand new and extremely nice!  The interior has a decent amount of tables, as well as some plush chairs/couches to sit and eat your ice cream.  I went with a Large Hot Fudge Sundae.  My total was just over $4.00.  I took my sundae to go and ate it in my car.  Here is how it was.........  Hot Fudge Sundae-  Well, Dairy Queen likes to keep things simple, I guess.  I was expecting some nuts, whipped cream, cherry etc.  Nope.  This thing had ice cream and hot fudge, only!  Hey..nothing wrong with that.  I am a simple man most of the time.  I was just expecting more (Also goes to show how many times I have been to an actual Dairy Queen...would have probably known if I had ever ordered it before) from a hot fudge sundae.  Was it good?  YES!  It was extremely good!  The ice cream they use was incredibly smooth and not too rich.  They use a TON of hot fudge!  It wasn't overly sweet either.  Would have been better with some crushed nuts on it, but I enjoyed it for what it was.  Cashier was friendly and the staff seemed like they enjoyed working there.  I will be back soon to try out their food and definitely to get some more ice cream."}
{"text":"Seeing the other reviews it's obvious the owners don't really care. Just left this location on 8/8 at 8:15 pm . I ordered a sm blizzard and my friend ordered a sm dipped cone . I tried to ordered a Coke and apparently the machine \"was down.\" More like you already cleaned it and are not trying to get it dirty so you can get out early .  To top it off my blizzard was runny and my friends ice cream was a large which we had to just throw it away. So to end this . I am highly disappointed ."}
{"text":"I could have had gelato.  The G-Spot is also on the way home. I could have had a lot of other things but I was just too lazy to get out of the car. The Beautiful Carin and I were on our way home last night.  We attended the terrific Yelp event at La Bocca. I grabbed a biscotto (singular for biscotti) on the way out (delightful...crispy and chocolaty with sweet anise finish) and I really should have been satisfied with that, but Noooooooo! I had to have something else. That turned out to be DQ on Scottsdale Road.  If you happen to be going north on Scottsdale Road, you can't successfully \"drive through\" this DQ unless you successfully \"jump the median curb\" and \"avoid a head on collision\"...all possible with all wheel drive, so I was good to go on that front, however, I arrived at the speaker to place my order in a slightly less relaxed state than I had anticipated. So I was less inclined to be forgiving when I ordered a waffle cone and heard my confirmation come back as \"&&^&*^~%^^%%$@~%&@%*~^(&(@&(~@^~*^@^@^~*@^\". It could have been that they were saying \"yes sir, we will have that cone ready for you at the window\", but we'll never know. Got my cone ($2.50), and it was already drippy...I know, I know, it's soft serve (that's what she said:), but still, I expect it to maintain a somewhat frosty and cohesive state, and wait until I get out of the drive through before it falls on  my lap. But, I suppose it tasted OK (the part I got to eat instead of wear). So, dripping cone in hand, we now get to try to successfully leave the drive through at DQ and return to our northbound heading...good luck! We were again fortunate that we have all wheel drive, because the driveway is steep enough to be labeled \"curb\" in most jurisdictions.  We bounced out into traffic and now needed to make it across 3 lanes of southbound traffic, make a u-turn across the median and negotiate the northbound traffic flow...with one hand! I was saved by 2 things: I spent part of my youth rodeo-ing (bareback bronc's) and I spent a considerably longer time racing (sports and formula cars). So, even with reflexes and visual acuity dulled by age, I was able to safely negotiate all of the hazards encountered trying to \"drive through\" DQ. I could have had a cookie. The ice cream stains came right out:)"}
{"text":"Well, let's see what was on the menu: dirty tables, 1 cashier, a guy with 3 badly-behaved boys, whom he let change their orders repeatedly, then ignored them, while they ran around yelling, climbed on booths, opened and slammed freezer doors,  argued amongst themselves. The rest of us had to wait while the one and only cashier disappeared into the kitchen to help with their order, then delivered their desserts. The light over the one clean boith was out, making it really dark at that table. The others were lit, but dirty. Some choice, right? However, the cashier was nice. I wished she had called someone to run the other register, and wish they vould get someone to make a schedule that served the customers. Btw, my cheeseburg was flat, rather dry, and ridiculously hot."}
{"text":"drive thru, avoid going in there. i always get the Hawaiian Blizzard! yumo"}
{"text":"We've been sitting in the drive thru for almost 35 minutes. They must be short staffed tonight as I only see 4 people working. It is older, dingy looking & parking is a challenge.  Our \"large\" Blizzard was only 3/4 full at best & quite melty. Our large orange Julius was a bit melty too, and definitely not full."}
{"text":"They don't have a lot of the regular Blizzard flavors listed on the menu at this location. The drive-thru guy was nice, but our ice cream was melty & when he flipped our Blizzards upside down they dripped. There was a lot of candy in our ice cream tho! The most negative part of this restaurant is the drive-thru itself - the driveway goes straight out to Rainbow which is frustration at rush hour!"}
{"text":"If I'm ordering a blizzard I'd expect it to be blended not only was half a banana intact in my daughters cup the ice cream looked completely white no add-ons in sight"}
{"text":"So I have been here quite a few times.... just never gotten around to writing a review for it.... I really enjoyed when they had the 2 for $3 hamburgers however they don't anymore. But they do have an awesome lunch deal where you get a burger or other choice of main dish, some fries, a drink, and a sundae for $5. That is pretty unbeatable honestly. The fries are meh but everything else is good... especially the ice cream and let's be honest that is the reason you came to dairy queen in the first place. Service is usually pretty quick and I have never really had a problem."}
{"text":"So you're on this corner around lunch time and tired of Jack in the Box and McDonalds, i'ts super hot, and you only have about $6. You walk in to DQ and see that they have combos for $5 from 11-4 that include a main dish, fries, drink, and a sundae. Switching up that burger and chicken routine you go for the wrap meal. You take a seat and are brought your drink and about five minutes later you are brought a tray with two wraps and fries. Everything tastes great, and then comes the best part.... a nice cold sundae with delicious fudge and peanut butter. (second topping is half a buck more) All this and you didn't even spend $7."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else.  It's clear that this DQ is struggling and they have resorted to cutting corners to make their numbers.  Here is what happens...  sales are down so let's cut corners (small portions, limited staff, selling \"dust\" as toppings, customers comes last - penny pinching comes first.).  The $0.02 you saved on a customers toppings will cost you significantly more!  Allow me to make a suggestion Mr DQ owner.  If you take care of the customer the sales will happen.  When you neglect the customer and treat them as an inconvenience the sales won't happen.  Stop chasing the savings and instead chase the customer by putting them first.  Heck, putting them a solid second at this place would be nice.    I won't be back and there are plenty of other options within a 1/4 mile.  Go elsewhere.  Look for the future \"space for rent\" sign.  Sad, I miss the old days."}
{"text":"3 customers in line, only one person ringing up and making items. I don't even want the darn ice cream anymore..geez"}
{"text":"Oh boy, where to start with this DQ. It is difficult to find something positive about this Dairy Queen location. First of all, it can only be entered by taking a right. Secondly, the parking and drive thru is incredibly cramped. The parking lot makes you wonder if you'll go home that night free of stab wounds. The inside of the restaurant reeks of a foul sewagy/moldy cheesy stench. My friends and I were not served at the register for 10 minutes before leaving. At one point, I saw something fall from the ceiling. One of the DQ employees also saw it. We made eye contact before we mentally agreed to ignore it and go on leading our cold, meaningless lives. This DQ experience was in a word, awful. I felt less optimistic about the world after leaving. It was weird, man."}
{"text":"First time at this location for us.  Dessert was good and quick, went inside as the drive thru was too long.  Asked for extra peanut butter cups and their reply was \"no problem\"."}
{"text":"The chicken strips aren't great, but they never are.  You can tell the employees want to be here, almost as much as the average chick-fil-a employee."}
{"text":"I want to like this location. I really do. Every time I've been here I've had a bad experience.  I get one thing and one thing only at DQ: a cherry dipped vanilla cone. It is always tasty, so that's where the two stars in my review come from.   The service is hit or miss. Mostly young teenagers who are friendly, but make a mess out of the pick-up area. Every time we are here, someone's order is wrong. Whether someone picked up the wrong order or they brought out items in an odd order, it's always a mess. We had someone random pick up our order (not the employees fault), but it took almost 20 minutes for them to get back to us with our order.   Last night my boyfriend ordered a large Orange Julius, and it definitely was not an Orange Julius. Tasted like a strawberry milkshake. Not sure what happened.   This DQ could be good if some improvements were made. It's not horrible, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere for now."}
{"text":"This is a Dairy Queen like all the rest.  Good stuff but it HAS NO DRIVE THRU!  A Dairy Queen w/o a drivethru is almost as bad as a DQ w/o ice cream.  Seriously!  Whaaa waaa waaa.  It's stupid.  Otherwise it's just like any othe DQ. It's friggin busy most evenings, especially after dinner.  I'd give it 4 or 5 stars but once we rolled up on the store 5-10 minutes before closing and they had the door locked.  KIDS!  It sucks being denied ice cream.  Maybe I should give them 2 stars.  Nah... most the time its a regular 'ol DQ."}
{"text":"I love a good old DQ cone every once in a while. Sure they cost more than Mickey D's cones but no where as good. I went to this place couple days ago and the temp was 108F! When I saw the DQ down the hill I just had to stop and grab a dip cone. My daughter and I first had to make a potty break. The bathrooms were clean but just showed age of wearing. We went to the counter and ordered our cones. The cones were perfect! The manager misunderstood my daughter's order but without any issue quickly gave her a new cone. The manager was very friendly and nice. I am glad I stopped here because reminded me of playing baseball as a kid and went to DQ after the game."}
{"text":"Love the sundaes,  the peanut butter parfaits,  etc........and the Buster bars are amazing, definitely take a few boxes home!   My fave is the butter pecan sundae, or the chocolate dipped cone... Although blizzards are all incredible too!  Their burgers are actually pretty good too! Definitely worth trying, they grill them over charcoal, which is a nice change!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Ice Cream at Dairy Queen nothing beats the Reese Peanut Butter Blizzard with Brownies...  This is one of those treats that should only be had once in a while as too keep from going into sugar overload.  This DQ is located in a nice shopping center where you can grab a dinner then head over for dessert... For me this visit was a sweet tooth needing an infusion of Peanut Butter & Chocolate!!! It was all that I needed the warm brownie chunks smothered in hot fudge, Vanilla Ice cream,  broken pieces of Reese Cups, & Creamy Peanut Butter all that slammed in a Blizzard Cup... Damn it was so good!!!!  The staff seemed overwhelmed when given more than three customers...  The girl working the register was totally lost after taking all our orders forgetting what orders where for who... Maybe that night she was new not sure but over all My Blizzard was Awesome so hats off to the Kid in the back making my order...  Overall: Great Blizzard Good Customer Service Good Location"}
{"text":"A hometown staple that has been here for years. Great place to get soft serve ice cream as well as sundaes, waffle cones, and other food.  On this visit I was in the mood for a strawberry sundae. Line was short so didn't have to wait long. It comes in three sizes. I opted for the medium. Real strawberries added to the vanilla ice cream made it delicious!  On hot summer days be prepared for long lines let alone ice cream melting once served. This current stand is under renovation but is open during the process. It is a little tricky to park since it sits on the corner of a major intersection.  Staff is friendly and cooperative."}
{"text":"Sunday night 4-19-15 at 9:50 girl taking orders at drive through has a serious attitude. Just because a couple cars came 10 min before you close doesn't mean the world stops for you! Open until 10pm means open until 10pm."}
{"text":"By far, the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to. Always 1-2 people outside smoking while you're waiting in the drive thru. Yes, us non-smokers love the smell of fresh cigarettes before we eat. Everyone that works here looks like an ex-con or current meth head. You pull up to the drive thru window, only to wait 40-60 seconds for someone to even come to the window and greet you.   Half the time I order my cheese curds, a third of em are fries. I didn't order fries. Cheese curds are more expensive, to boot.   I ordered chicken strips once. Never again. 2 of the 4 were half the size of the other two. The strips at Albertsons are actually better tasting.  Gave 2 stars instead of 1, cuz I gave em the benefit of the doubt of getting quality help in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend not stopping here no matter how desperate you are for ice cream. You'll be waiting long enough that you could eat 3 meals. Absolutely horrible and will never go back."}
{"text":"So I am not a big Dairy Queen fan / eater...until I want a milkshake!   Dairy Queen is one of the only places that still make shakes the old fashion way...with milk, ice cream and ext (strawberries are my poison of choice), not with chemicals and milk extract thingys. They are SO good.   So, if your pregnant, or just eat like you do, and get a craving for some real, good time, old time milkshake to shake up your world.  Go to Dairy Queen and get hooked up. - Tell them Tanya sent you. (on second thought, don't , they won't know who you are talking about hahahahha)"}
{"text":"I grew up on orange julius' in Balboa Beach and Whitwood Mall.  I do not remember them with so much chunky ice. I couldn't even drink it with a straw. Maybe this location needs a new blender?"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Love this place. Get the 5 buck lunch. Burger, fries, and ice cream with soda. Disapointed that they removed grill burger. But, at least I can upgrade it for a dollar more."}
{"text":"I usually get the same thing, and a small, since I shouldn't have dairy. The staff are courteous and pretty efficient. What I had a difficult time adjusting to was the sour odor. They were closing and I a assuming had already mopped some areas of the restaurant, since there were no sitting customers. What ever they are using is disgusting and needs to be changed or thrown away. Just don't go the pine sol route, then it will smell like a bathroom."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this is the place to go! Love their blizzards and warmed deserts. The brownie cookie is the best! They can be a little slow, but what places aren't?"}
{"text":"Hey who doesn't love a blizzard or chocolate dipped cone, this is not against Dairy Queen but this location makes getting a frozen treat such a headache! Every time we go I get a medium vanilla dipped cone, simple right, and my boyfriend gets a medium chocolate dipped cone with chocolate ice cream, little more complicated but nothing even I child could not handle! This store never ever gets our order right, even after we ask the cashier to repeat the order before it is made! My boyfriend normally never gets the chocolate ice cream as requested and we never get the right size cones! A couple times the cones have come out without the chocolate dip, which we then kindly ask for the cones to be dipped like we had ordered! At this point the crew normally becomes very confused and down right rude when being asked kindly to fix their mistake! The crew that can not take a simple order is also rude, does not make eye contact, will throw your payment back at you, and are slow! Save yourself the frustration and time and go to a different Dairy Queen for that sweet tooth fix!"}
{"text":"Walked in and grabbed an ice cream cake from the case, one of the 3 they had, and proceeded to the counter to pay. Presented my card to the cashier she swiped the card and turned the screen to face me at which point I was shocked. The screen asks how much did I want to tip, are you kidding me, a tip is something you get for a service above and beyond not for swiping a plastic card reader."}
{"text":"Really bad service, the ice cream was liquid, the place stinks and is dirty and gross. The wait for one ice cream cone takes about 10 min. I will not he back. Dairy Queen sucks."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place -5 stars. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. They gave us melted blizzards, did not even apologize, treated me and my family like garbage. I would never EVER go back to this Dairy Queen (or any others) EVER again and I would advise everyone to stay away. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"We stopped here yesterday around 1:30 for a banana split. And,, wait for it...they were OUT of whipped cream. I know. So why didn't the manager go buy some you wonder? ..Me too! Isn't that like Taco Bell being out of hot sauce? The person behind the counter was not happy to be there, borderline rude, pissy look on her face. It was just a bad experience."}
{"text":"When Fro-Yo is all the rage - I cannot deny that DQ was or maybe even still is my favorite place to get a frozen treat.    The DQ's around town do not have the Mr Misty Freeze on their menu boards.  However, you can still order it and they will still make it.  It is kinda of the secret menu...  It is the arctic slushy with soft serve ice cream blended together!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I always get the lime flavor.  The Mr Misty Freeze is one of those things that just makes me down right happy!"}
{"text":"Every single employee here needs to be fired. Today is September 15th 2017 at 4:03pm at the Excalibur location .   Myself as well as 7 other people are here waiting in line and with 3 people working it's taking over 15 minutes to make ONE DRINK. And none of them could even take an order while the other ones were attempting to make a customer's drink!  How long can it possibly take to make 1 single drink?!?! Needless to say I will never come back here since I probably won't get my drink even if I had the chance to order one!"}
{"text":"I have stopped by this drive-thru many times over the last two years. I have always received fast, friendly service and good food. Today I bought a tossed salad with grilled chicken. It was really good. For people not able to leave small dogs in cars or at home, this is a nice alternative. I wish there were more restaurants, like the ones in New York, that allow people to dine with their dogs."}
{"text":"i will never!!!!!!! go back to this establishment again!!! they have the most incompetent workers ever working there!!!!! sitting in the drive thru for over 15 minutes is totally unacceptable!!! when i walked in to see what was going on they were just starting my food after sitting in drive thru for over 15 minutes.  supppppppppppperrrrrr slow service and they must have hired the pre-k crew because they were sure not the brightest set of workers.  i asked for the manager and of course they didn't know who that was.....stay away from this location they are plain ass stupid and incompetent."}
{"text":"I love this Dairy Queen! It reminds me of the ones back home near Cape Cod. They still write out paper receipts and walk orders back to the kitchen. So yes, when it's busy, you'll wait a little bit. Be patient though -- it's worth the wait!  I come over here about once a week or so for the lunch deal. For $5 -- YES $5!!! -- you get a drink, a sundae, two chicken wraps AND fries! There are several different variations. That one's my favorite though. Happy lunching!"}
{"text":"Stay away,   If you want to wait for your food that is sitting on the counter for 12 mins (yeah i timed it) for them to realize that they need to give it to you still it then this is the place. Never seen such bad service. They were not busy. They had 6 people in the front where 1 was training the cashier which is understandable and 4 others standing around looking like fools.   The moment the food touched our hands, you can tell that it was no longer hot and barely lukewarm. Seriously? Told them that they need to step it up and they said some unkind words back. Then again I can see that will be working in fast food for the rest of their lives!"}
{"text":"It's DQ and the service in this particular one was friendly, the place was clean and open. Ive been here a bunch over the years visiting the area and the shakes, butterscotch dipped cones and dilly bars have never disappointed me. I've eaten the corndogs too and there pretty good as well."}
{"text":"This really is the worse Dairy Queen I've ever been too. I've been there three times and have been disappointed. The first time I went there with my boyfriend and we waited almost an hour for our blizzards. By the time we got our order, it was melted. We disregarded because they were busy. So we tried them a second time since they didn't seem as busy. Our ice cream still came out melted and they gave us the wrong order. So being hopeful we decided to try them one last time. I ordered a  Mocha Moo latte this time and they gave me an iced mocha. The guy who was helping us said he would make it right... I've had moo lattes at other Dairy Queen's and it always comes out thick and creamy. It did not come at that way. It wasn't completely blended (as you can see the coffee is at the bottom), it was runny and tasted disgusting! The only thing safe to get at this location is a plain or dipped cone. The next time we get a craving for Dairy Queen we will drive out to Boulder City, since it's only a 5 minute difference from my house."}
{"text":"$3.79 for the small blizzard. Really??!   I laughed when I saw the size as I picked it up through the drive-thru. I guess it's just been a long time since I've had a blizzard.   Dang! Guess I won't be getting one of those again for a while. (Which is probably a good thing.)"}
{"text":"I ordered a peanut buster parfait tonight.  I got it home,  and unlike the picture on the menu, the top of it was caked with peanuts. Absolutely covered. So I took the lid off, and peanuts flew everywhere.  All over my shirt, all over the floor,  everywhere.   I took the spoon and went in for the first bite. More peanuts fell off, all over the table and the floor again. When i put the first bite in my mouth,  I noticed the peanuts were very, very, very salty.  And a few of them were very, very hard. Like I thought my teeth were going to break hard. There was barely any hot fudge, but lots of little salty,  hard little peanuts.  I only took a few bites. The hot fudge and ice cream were good,  and usually everything I get here is decent,  but this parfait was horrible. I've had it before, but never again!   Now,  all that said,  the pumpkin pie blizzard is amazing,  the chocolate truffle blizzard is amazing and rich,  and they make great malts. Their chili dog is great,  and their burgers are very tasty. This location is kind of slow,  but their staff is always friendly and they get it right most of the time. A decent place.  Not the Taj Mahal, but certainly okay."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm yelping about a Dairy Queen... After waiting a long time after placing my blizzard order, I get to the window and then the guy tells me they don't have chocolate ice cream. Seriously?! Waste of my time."}
{"text":"When visiting the in laws in Lake County, this place trumps all other local fast food(Steak n Shake, Wendy's, horrible Hardees) for comfort food. Which you need when visiting family. Comfort. The chicken strip meals and ice cream are not all that memorable, but consistently satisfying. My dog freaks out when we come here. She basically knows all the different drive thru's between Lakewood and Mentor. This is one of her faves. Although the toast they give you in meals is a bit weird. And dry. But whatever. As long as it doesn't give me the runs, I approve."}
{"text":"Went last night. They Orange Julius game tight, but no hamburgers? Apparently, they are not a full Brazier's, so no meat. They did have a dog treat for Roxy, but still. No burger action? Why are you even here? I think I'd get more to eat from a Fotomat. If they aren't gonna make burgers, then raze this dump and put up some public art. Eyesore."}
{"text":"Standard DQ.  A bit tiny so maybe get to your food to go if it's busy.  I had a red velvet blizzard and the small was more than enough.  It was tasty.  Well done."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a late night treat and ordered a triple chocolate brownie. Little did I know that the kid behind the counter had no clue what he was doing, he didn't put ice cream on it but he smothered it in whipped cream. I was in a rush and didn't notice until I got home to eat it. I must say I'm extremely disappointed because I used to work at a Dairy Queen and it's not that hard to understand how important the ice cream is in any treat you get from Here."}
{"text":"This is the closest Dairy Queen to me, so my brother and I frequent here a lot. We mainly go for the shakes and blizzards as well as the ice cream cakes when it's someone's birthday. The ones that we've tried are actually pretty delicious. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the people who work here are 90% crap whenever we come here. There are a lot of times where I've encountered rude staff, but it's not something that I can't tolerate. I go for the food anyway and not the service."}
{"text":"Great ice cream!! Unfortunately, you WILL WAIT until CHRISTMAS to even order anything in the first place!! There is absolutely NO sense of Speed-of-Service here! By the time you get your order placed and served, you could've waited until next snowfall and made your own!!"}
{"text":"went in to get a quick ice cream cake for my dad's birthday today and since there were no prices in the cakes, I asked the cashier for the prices. after sounding completely irritated that he had to walk to the freezer, he looked at the cake I wanted and walked away while saying the price. long story short, I ended up buying the cake. after paying for it, I asked if they write on the cake and he said yes. I wrote down exactly what I wanted, \"Happy 80th Birthday Dad!\" he took back the cake to another lady and came back out about 15mins later and said, \"here you go, hope you like it!\"   Idk if this is just me, but when you tell me you write on cakes, please specify the level of experience. I mean, if it were me, I'd definitely let my penmanship be known. imagine my face when they brought the cake back to me and I saw the picture below!? then you say, \"hope you like it!\" I almost asked, who wrote this? is there a child back there doing this? smh! do not by any chance, let them write on your cake!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my three siblings to get ice cream after going on the carousel at The District. We've been to all the ice cream and yogurt places on Eastern, and Layers was closed, so we wanted to try Dairy Queen.  Walking in, you get hit in the face with the smell of burnt grease. It's really foul smelling. The place was freaking packed. Literally, half of Henderson was in there ordering ice cream. The freezer case was nearly empty and it looked dirty.   I was sick of driving around and once inside, my sister spotted a weekday 2-for-1 deal going on. Mondays were bogo free banana splits, so we got that and my brother wanted a chocolate dipped cone, so I got him one of those as well. Our total came out to a little over $7. Not bad.   One thing, you better specify what sauces you want or else you'll just get the regular chocolate, pineapple and strawberry. There's something about pineapple sauce that makes me leery, so I asked them to make it marshmallow sauce instead.   The ice cream was okay. Nothing spectacular. My sister complained that the banana tasted old. I couldn't notice any difference and my brother didn't like the chocolate shell, so he made our youngest sister eat the shell off the cone. Whatever.   The weekday specials are a good deal, but it's best to not eat in the restaurant until they can get that horrid smell out and spruce up a bit."}
{"text":"Wrote to DQ Canada, said they'd look into this location, it's been weeks and nothing done, not even an attempt to comfort me into going back and pay again.   Im very disappointed that a company like DQ falsely advertises just to get you in the door. This location has forever lost my business. I hope you have a better experience, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The drive through lights and all the business signs we're off so the place looked closed when I pulled up at 9:50. It's a good thing the hours in this Yelp page show it should be opened until 11:00  PM. I would be very upset if I were the owner and the manager decided to turn off the exterior business lights an hour early.   The drive through was empty when I pulled up and it was 6 deep when I left, I guess anther customers saw me in the drive through and decided it might be open.   The service was fast and the ice cream was delightful."}
{"text":"This is a premo dairy queen. I visit this location 2-3 times a month and I am always pleased. To be fair I only get blizzards but they are always perfect consistency and quality. Butterfinger Blizzard is excellent flavor combo. The drive through is pretty quick but does sometimes spill into the street which can make the line annoying to navigate."}
{"text":"Specifically came to try the new Royal Oreo Blizzard....got home to just a normal Oreo blizzard...get it right!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I came to this store. I had a coupon for a buy one get one free Blizzard good only at this store. This is your average DQ. it is clean and the service is good. The server we had was polite and quite perky. It's nice to see someone who enjoys their job. The blizzards were out to us quickly and were perfect. No problem returning for another one someday."}
{"text":"I like the blizzards here. They have a different flavor each month. The service is always fast and the quality always consistent. My quick fix desert stop."}
{"text":"I love DQ, but this location leaves quite a bit to be desired.   There are never any other customers in the restaurant when we've gone in and I guess that should be an indication. The staff is super slow and basically act like they would rather be doing anything other than making sundaes.  There has been a sign on the door for awhile that says that the fryer is broken and they can't make any fried foods. How long does it take to get this fixed? Any operating business should be ashamed to have to tell people who want to purchase an item \"no.\"   I'd rather drive the 15 minutes it takes to get to Sonic than go to this DQ, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I took my kids to this location over the weekend. The owner happened to be there. She was fun and funny, and the entire staff was fun and friendly.  It was my first time to this location, and since I just moved to that area, I wanted to check it out.  It was delicious.  We enjoyed Blizzards, and a banana split, and chocolate dipped cones.  A very teary eyed woman came in and asked if she could post a picture of her missing dog.  The owner was so comforting and caring, it was nice to see that in a neighborhood DQ. The place was clean, and fun. I never really knew how many specialty cakes they offer and at this location, you can get it personalized with a picture. I also didn't realize how many to-go ice creams that are offered, the Butterscotch Dilly Bars are now my new favorite, as well as the Vanilla Orange.  The place was filled with fun families.  Loved it here. Will make it my weekly stop with the kids from now on.  And promised my kids a dipped cone for every A they bring home this semester!"}
{"text":"I went in here with my family.  We ordered our desert.  I had a nice conversation with the GM. I believe his name as Scott.  This location is close to our home.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not the worst DQ I've been in. I live nearby so I stop here a lot. Great location, I find the staff to usually be friendly and quick. Food is usually OK, typical DQ. Free wifi here as well."}
{"text":"I find it challenging to write a review when it comes to fast food, due to the fact the each experience is vastly different from each other. Since i have been to the dairy queen on warm springs/ arroyo grande quite a few times, I am confident on rating it a 3 of 5 stars.  The blizzards, moolatas, etc are usually all very good. This last visit, my husband got a double cheese burger combo and i got a bacon cheese burger combo, regular size. The food was decent. We also got the new strawberry golden oreo blizzards, medium size. For the food and ice cream total for the two of us it was about $23. The one thing that bothers me is that they will not substitute the soda for a blizzard (not even for an extra charge).  Biggest downfalls for this location are the service and the drive-thru design. Since i have been there a few times I can honestly say the service is not very good. It's rare to find extrodinary service in fast food, but my expectations are not very high to begin with. I have had a few orders messed up, but it is rare. What i mean by bad service is that it is noticably bad. The servers have very dry personalities and are very slow on service. As far as the drive-thru goes, it is hard to maneuver through. It's not horrible, but because traffic is bad there, it can be hard to get to.  I would recommend this location for it's convenience, but dont have big expectations for service. If you want a tasty, satisfying cold treat, give it a try. Besides, fast food workers come and go. It will be different every visit."}
{"text":"Waiting a while for my Sunday but it's well worth it I would recommend the strawberry cheese quake blizzard"}
{"text":"This place was jumping around 4PM on a Saturday afternoon.  The inside and drive through were lined with patrons and cars.  I quickly noticed the age of the building both outside and inside.  It is definitely in need of a major upgrade, but considering the constant flow of customers, this would be a major task.  In any case, the line flowed pretty quickly.  I told myself that if all of these people could enjoy ice cream on a warm afternoon, I deserved to do the same!  The M&M Blizzard is my staple and that's what I ordered.  For another person in my party, I requested and paid for extra toppings for her blizzard but when I received it, the extra toppings were not there.  Fortunately, I asked the server before grabbing my bag and he quickly added the extra per my request.  The little one ordered the $5 meal special with a big cheeseburger, fries, and a drink at the suggestion of the server.  She was quite pleased with her meal.  Other than the dated furnishings of the restaurant, the ice cream and food items are still popular.  They have plenty of extra parking spaces as well.  I have no complaints about the food or ice cream served at this location."}
{"text":"We go maybe twice a year. We would go more, maybe for the occasional weekday fast food dinner, but the staff make it a hassle for us to go. Every time we go, the order needs to be repeated at least 3 times. Once it was 5! Our order is always somewhat the same. How hard is it to remember 1 small strawberry sundae, 3 small Blizzards - Skor,Oreo & Cheesecake. Done. Unbelievable!! And then the pace at which they make the food is Glacial! No one is at all interested in getting an order made promptly. It's as though it's everybody's first time at the soft serve dispenser! Also, get a handle on the door situation! Vestibule is way too small! Open the two front doors and hold them open with door stops. Also maybe clean them every once in a while. The door handles are always gross. This location had some big negative media attention a few years back, you'd think they's go above and beyond to earn back a good reputation!"}
{"text":"Customer service is absolutely horrendous.... I purchased my order, tasted it and immediately realized I didn't like it. I asked the woman if I could exchange it for something else. She Refused! Then stated that only a manager could do something like that.  I asked for a manager and apparently no managers were there that night, only a supervisor with no compassion or apologetic tones in her voice. Which was worse than talking to the drive thru representative.  I am going to make a formal complaint with the manager of that particular establishment, about how the situation was handled."}
{"text":"It was all good until the manager/owner yelled at me just because I was talking to the employeea while I waited,  just to pass the time.  Never happen to me before that ruin my viait"}
{"text":"I brought a group of kids here and the staff were extremely rude and disrespectful. A kid was asking how much a blizzard is and the girl's response was \"same price as all blizzards are\". She did this several times and then continued to be rude to my clients rolling her eyes, slamming down their order and staring at our group. What she and the others did not realize was these kids live in a treatment facility and this was a reward for having amazing behavior and not being aggressive towards their peers. All the kids noticed but were safe and said it was ok. It's not ok. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Peanut. Buster. Parfait. The. End."}
{"text":"Love this place! The employees are always so incredibly friendly. Especially our favorite blizzard wizard BREI!! She consistently makes the best blizzards, that always live up to the \"upside down\" test they do."}
{"text":"If you are craving a delicious hot dog from Dairy Queen and happen to stumble by this location, make sure the hot dogs are not really cold. We thought this was a joke, but we had 2 small kids in the car and already on the way home from the drive thru. This was so disappointing on our visit July 1 at 1:30p. Nevertheless, our chicken finger meals were really tasty and my little one enjoyed these along with his juice box. If we decide to stop by again, we will not get the hot dogs."}
{"text":"This DQ at Baywood and Power Road in Mesa AZ is the worst dq I have ever been to.  We have not tried it once but tried it several times as it is close to where we live.  One time they were out of ice cream, yep that's what they said.  One time they were out of toppings, one time they could not get their cash register open just recently.  The manager could not even get it open.  Just now my husband went through the drive through and the man could not even get the order right so he just drove off.  It is by far the worst dairy queen around."}
{"text":"Horrible. Was just inside and the floors and counters are filthy. Headed toward back room area with the red walls and again filthy dirty. They should call this place QD for Quite Dirty. The board of health needs to shut it down."}
{"text":"Just went to this dairy queen and were very disappointed. Took forever to get through the drive through line even though there was only 3 cars total including my own in line, one car in front of me and one behind. The guy taking the order seemed pretty clueless and I had to repeat myself many times. We got a bacon cheeseburger meal which was fine and chili cheese fries that had a small amount of chili and almost no cheese. We also got two blizzards which was a huge mistake they were terrible! Tasted like we were eating sour cream."}
{"text":"I've never eaten anything but ice cream at Dairy Queen, but recently I was encouraged by a coworker to give it a try.  This Dairy Queen gets pretty busy, but I was served within five minutes.  The shrimp is actually really good; not too fried-tasting.  The fries are as good as any competitor's, and the sauces here are not bad!  However, what really blew me away was the blizzard.  Mm!  How can you go wrong with an Oreo Blizzard from Dairy Queen?  I got the biggest one, and it was definitely too much for me to finish.  Service here was courteous though not exactly friendly.  Their selection of ice cream cakes was ample and tasty looking!"}
{"text":"This is a horrible location. When I go through the drive thru, none of my items ever have lids on them and they are never in a bag. I shouldn't have to ask the workers for those things to be done. You would think a drive thru order would just imply that items are bagged up. Our orders are almost always wrong and way more than expensive than they should be. This location is also more expensive than the Gilbert location. I'd rather drive the extra 5 miles in the opposite direction than go to this location. The employees at this location are not very friendly nor upbeat."}
{"text":"No french fries cuz the fryer is busted...hmmm. They offered chips so guessing it's been busted awhile.  :(  Actually one of the worst DQ's I've been to.  They put the corn dog in the microwave!!  ick."}
{"text":"Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was yummy. Service was slow you could tell they don't get a lot of business in the middle of the afternoon. Might be back."}
{"text":"Love the cake but not the service..... And there's a sign that said I didn't have to wait to pick up my order, but I had to get in line.... Grrr"}
{"text":"The past 2 times I came here they didn't put turkey on my turkey BLT. Last time I came here they didn't have the powder for the Orange Julius. Now I had to wait for a few minutes just for a cashier to come up front and acknowledge us. Then he seemed like we were and inconvenience to him. Really not worth all the issues. Go to any other DQ, trust me."}
{"text":"What a nice Dairy Queen!  The service was very friendly, and the employees genuinely smiled and offered to help immediately as we entered the store.  The walls are lined with posters of special deals at that location, and it appears that this store is very active in the local community by the posted awards and certificates of appreciation.  As for the ice cream, the menu was extensive and our orders were ready almost immediately.  Very yummy treats...we got a strawberry chocolate blizzard, a butterfinger blizzard, and a chocolate mint oreo blizzard.  The only complaint that I have is that the music was a bit loud, but that's just a matter of taste.  Everything else was wonderful, and I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but wasn't as delicious as I remember back in the day DQ was better than ok but then again I was a pothead! But their blizzard are still better than ever && this location isn't dirty it's pretty clean. But I'm going to stick to the blizzards && eat a real meal some where else. So if you come here make sure it's for desert."}
{"text":"Love this place. Why? Only DQ close to me that still make Confetti Cake blizzards!!  In addition, the many times I have been here, service has been good & products consistently good.  Can't stop, Don't stop the confetti cake!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect sunny day for an icecream!  The Peanut Buster Parfait is my favourite icecream.  Cold icecream with fudge and peanuts!  Onion Rings @ Dairy Queen are the best.  This location has been here for a long time and it looks like there are new owners."}
{"text":"Okay, so my friend Lucy's friend and my new XBOXLIVE friend Davida got me back into DQ....  I remember having DQ like once a long time ago at Del Amo Mall in Torrance and I could've sworn that it was expensive, but when me and my girlfriend tried this particular one in Las Vegas, I was surprised at how pretty affordable it is! First off, I love how this DQ was right next to an Albertson's and an L&L Hawaiian BBQ!!!!  Me and my lady ended up getting some 12oz blizzards for only $3.69.  Now...12oz looks and sounds small, but I tell you...these Blizzards are extremely thick, delicious and can fill you up!! PAUSE! (Boondocks \"no homo\" reference).  I also love how DQ has teamed up with Orange Julius and you can even order some pretty decent chilli dogs and other foods aside from ice cream cakes, shakes, etc.  I ended up getting the OREO cookie Blizzard http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wjIsjqbp3JFLNmwEoiNMmQ?select=3EceVAeQsNjXJedKX4EfBA   and my lady got like a OREO cheesecake blizzard: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wjIsjqbp3JFLNmwEoiNMmQ?select=l0lkpHjqQnBXtfiSi-mFTA   and WOW...sooooo damn great for this hot hot Las Vegas weather! The place is very clean and the guy that was working there was nice as hell...he gave me and my lady some great suggestions, plus he gave us some history on how famous DQ has been for so many years and they even have been endorsed and plugged by Donald Trump on his show \"The Apprentice\".    Honestly, I love how it's cheaper and as great as Cold Stone....it is also wayyyy better and cheaper than Baskin Robbins!  The DQ Blizzards are so damn thick, that you can even flip your cup of blizzard upside down and it won't slide out!!!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wjIsjqbp3JFLNmwEoiNMmQ?select=T8t1LEywcxEHWnkU_Vmfow  This is a definite stop to literally \"chill out\" at whenever you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Service here is really horrible. The staff has a bad attitude. Like they are doing you a favour by serving you. They dont accept any credit cards. Only cash or debit. The Superfruit Acai smoothie tastes like its made out of powder, but the Wildberry light smoothie is thirst quenching. The view is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen.... It is what it is. This place has a drive-thru.   I got a blizzard with extra reeces cups. Delicious. But really, anything with reeces cups is good."}
{"text":"Worst Dairy Queen ever. Their ice cream is all MELTED!!! From their cones to their dilly bars. This place is a joke. This was the second and last time I ever come here. Whoever is managing this Dairy Queen is ASLEEP or just doesn't care at all. Staff is super slow and rude to boot. What an awful experience."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen was a mystery to me before meeting my girlfriend. She introduced me to the delicious chicken strips and wonderful drinks. The blizzards are made with a multitude of toppings! I will be coming back frequently to get my chicken strip fix and a great dessert!"}
{"text":"I would do no stars if i could. Every time i go to this location, the service is terrible and they have no chocolate ice cream.  Tonight was no different.  I went in and there was no chocolate ice cream, i asked why and was told it was close to closing so they shut it down ( this was an hour before closing). The lady was rude when we ordered. We sat down and waited. 9:09 is when we ordered 3 Ice cream cones and 1 strawberry sundae.  They finally brought them out at 9:27. That is 18 minutes!!! I could understand if it was busy, but other than us there was only 3 or 4 other families inside. At least the ice cream was good."}
{"text":"This location doesn't have DQs' famous chicken tenders. Not worth going to since everything on the menu is way overpriced (almost $5 for small blizzard). Never going here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! I went in a week ago to order a pizza treatza for my sons birthday. The first bad sign was a big sign on their door stating the chocolate ice cream machine was broken and when I went inside in their freezer case it was totally empty. I asked to order a cake and the girl behind the counter said I don't know if we do that let me ask. After a few minutes she came back and I explained what I wanted and she wrote down the details and I told her it was from a week from now. I came back to pick up the cake there was still a sign on the door stating the ice cream machine was broken but now there was a sign saying their credit card machine was broken so they took only cash. When I asked for my cake the kid tried to charge me double what had been quoted and when I told him that was not the right price he said oh OK and rang it up for the original price. When they brought out the pizza treatza I was shocked it looked like a smashed Oreo cookie with just the ice cream from a single cone that had melted. And then they just covered it with lots of chocolate syrup and crushed M&m. At that point I just said fine and left. Attached are what it looks like on the webpage and what we got it was horrible will never go there again. When I got home and cut it I discovered most of the ice cream was melted below the cardboard but still they couldn't have done more than one ice cream cone with of ice cream on the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Hey.. when it's warm outside nothing is better than a soft serve ice cream cone.  This location i found to be well staffed, clean and freindly.  My only reservation about giving them five stars was the item I ordered was a dipped cone.. you know the three circles and a tail at the top. Well let's just say the employee didn't care much for branding as mine looked more like a disheveled pile than the signature \"look\""}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't be as annoyed with this situation if I didn't have a bad lunch experience someone else today. Attached is my 4 piece chicken strip meal. These are no bigger than chicken nuggets. I'm not kidding.   To top it off they are not hot and neither are the fries. I'm already home and don't want to turn back around. This is ridiculous. So, if you order chicken strips, hope that you don't get 4 nuggets because it's a waste of your money."}
{"text":"$30 cake ruined ... so bummed that my son's bday cake looks like this after the car ride home ... why put the candy crumbs if they are going to do this!! Thanks for ruining my son's birthday!"}
{"text":"First time at this DQ & customer service very friendly & happy to answer ?'s.  Ordered 2 blizzards, 1  ex.lg. Truffle & 1 Oreo! Watched how they make this awesome dessert & lots of truffles & lots of Oreo pieces! Big enough to share! Will definitely be back and recommend! Saw reviews and maybe new mgmt.?"}
{"text":"Let me start off this review by saying prior to a month ago, I HARDLY (if ever) went to Dairy Queen. My sister use to work at one and I went to the one location in Henderson once.  Dairy Queen really needs to advertise and push out their $5 lunch menu. I discovered it through a coworker who would occasionally decide to have lunch here. For $5, yes 5 buckaroos, you get to choose between a chicken wrap, a cheeseburger, chicken tenders, and a chili cheese dog. All these meals include french fries and a sundae of your choice (caramel, chocolate, or strawberry), and all of them come with a drink. This is ALL for $5. My mind is still blown at how much of a deal this really is.  The location I go to has a drive-thru, which I believe most places do as well nowadays. I come here during my lunch break and get my meal within 10 minutes for the most part. I really can't go wrong when choosing this place.  P.S. They have this fry sauce and that is pretty bomb.com, if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"When did DQ stop having mr.misty floats?? It has been at least a decade since I've been to a dairy queen, but that was a sad surprise. They had Arctic something or other, basically a slurpee and it wasn't the same, way way too sweet. They have the classics - blizzard, dip cone, and I think buster bars? Its nice to see an old school dairy queen still standing even if they didn't have what I came for"}
{"text":"Was greeted as soon as we walked in. Service was very fast. Food was good. Had a small error in order ."}
{"text":"Restaurant review There is not many options for food in tuscola, so after we finished shopping we thought about going back to Champaign for dinner, but this place caught my eye as a quick meal. Service was friendly and the food was prepared quickly. The combo meals are reasonable priced from 5 to 7 dollars. I ended up with the 1/2 lb flame burger which actually tasted better than McD or Wendy's. There is ample parking at this location as well. Overall if you don't mind fast food this is actually a nice place for a quick meal.  Pros: friendly service, clean, large parking lot  Cons: it is still fast food  Hidden deals: 5 dollar lunch time deal, bacon cheeseburger, fries, drink, and a dessert."}
{"text":"They are rude here so no bueno :( who doesn't like Dairy Queen right? Man I wanted this hotdog and Oreo Shake so bad and it was everything I imagined it would be. Nothing like washing down a hotdog with ketchup and slaw and an Oreo blizzard. Mouth watering.   Not very impressed with the service. Most were very friendly but the manager running it was actually very mean. Nothing like going somewhere and being made to feel like an idiot. That's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. The food is awesome. But I think that one manager hates her job. It's not cool to treat customers like they are stupid. Not cool at all."}
{"text":"Have visited this location twice now and both types the store/employees have been the middle of some type of \"crisis.\" Last time it was something to do with the credit card machine and it took 3 different employees to finally complete the transaction.   Today, the ice cream machine broke and a store-ful of people were waiting for ice cream.  Just seems to be poorly managed."}
{"text":"Frustrating when you order a blizzard that is supposed to have peanut butter.. especially when your pregnant and the peanut butter is what your craving. You get the blizzard and it's only chocolate."}
{"text":"Took my kids to get ice cream and ended up walking out as I was at the register ordering. There were far too many employees trying to handle all the orders, and they were sniffing the ice cream because they couldn't figure out which one had banana in it. Very unprofessional not to mention unsanitary having someones noise in your ice cream. Will never go to this location ever again, so glad I ended up walking out."}
{"text":"It's obnoxious that even though they have no customers they are dicks about using their parking lot to go to Dutch Bros...the only business worth actually going to. Manager was extremely rude. I'd rather go to one of the many quality ice cream places in Gilbert."}
{"text":"The shopping center may be a little questionable, but there is nothing to question about their Ice Cream skills here.    More than any other Dairy Queen I've seen in Phoenix, you leave here with something that looks like it could have been in a picture.  And if it doesn't look like the picture, it's because they made the cone too big, or gave you extra ice cream in your frosty.  I'm telling you - it has all been really amazing.  They even handled a more detailed special order super - every time we've gotten it. The interesting thing is, the last time I had anything close to that there was a much older manager who'd been doing it for years.  Everyone in the place seems pretty young - but they seem to have a great sense of pride in doing the job.  I've actually heard workers say, when something didn't come out well - but before it had ever been handed to a customer, \"You know what, I can't serve this to you like this, hold on just a moment and I'll make you a better one\".  Where else are you going to get service like that?"}
{"text":"If you don't know how to make it, don't put it on your menu, don't accept the order, don't have a button for it on your computer and don't try to hand off your creation to the person in the drive through who will be pulling away before they notice.  I'm not asking for much.    They screwed up a mud pie blizzard.  I love mud pie blizzards and could have most likely given them most of the things you add to create it.  Instead I got an Oreo blizzard with what tasted like maybe a half a shot of coffee - but not much at all because it was still just as white as a regular Oreo blizzard.  Sigh... so sad.  I finally treat myself and they screw it up.  We also ordered a large dipped cone that came out looking like a kids sized/small.  We actually sent it back for them to re-make.  Sent back ice cream. You know it went uneaten. So sad.    But - they have an amazing menu of food.  More food than I feel like I see at other locations.  But of course we were here for ice cream - not food.  And if memory serves from when I worked in the area, they do a decent job with that - though nothing that makes you want to go running back.   It's convenient.  And with Carvel closed down in the area, it might be getting a little more action."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review, and I'm writing it because of marshmallow sauce. Yes, you read that correctly. I have been to this Dairy Queen location several times since moving to Vegas a few months ago (how else is one truly supposed to survive these satanic summer temperatures) and my experience can best be described as consistently inconsistent. When they get my order correct it's great, but they don't get my order right often. Most recently I repeated my order of 2 blizzards to them 4 times over the drive thru, then again once I pulled up to confirm they had heard me correctly. I was assured they were preparing what I ordered. As I pull away from the drive thru window, I bite into my blizzard to taste- vanilla. Now folks, I can assure you I did not move to Las Vegas to live a vanilla lifestyle. I ordered a blizzard with chocolate ice cream. And they forgot other ingredients that I paid extra for on numerous occasions. My tipping point with this location is when I went to order a blizzard with marshmallow sauce and the employee responded they had \"got rid of it\". Well looks like y'all got rid of our business at this location too. Now I'm not some kind of Dairy Queen, but I was a shift manager at DQ back in high school & I have to say, get your drive thru employees' hearing checked or something. If you can't handle me at my 2 ingredient blizzard request you don't deserve me at my peanut buster parfait. I'll be sticking to Yogurtland where I can add my own toppings, because if you want something done right apparently self serve is the only way."}
{"text":"I went to this dairy queen to get a double cheese burger. I hadn't been to a dairy queen in quite a while but decided this was a good idea. They used to run specials on the double cheese for 2 for $3. I really liked them. What I got the other night was stale patties from a drawer and put on the bun with all condiments and nuked in the microwave. I tasted plastic and cheap. I know this is not a $6 hamburger,  but for f... sakes take some pride.  On a positive note, the peanut buster parfait was acceptable. It has really tainted my view of dairy queen."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service by the guys.... Ordered a chicken bacon ranch sandwich and took longer than expected. The place could use a little picking up. The tables were sticky...need to be wiped and cleaned."}
{"text":"I expected to get flavored ice cream (coffee) but may have been thinking about somewhere else. My daughters liked their blizzards. I probably won't visit again. The vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup I settled for was okay. I would save the calories next time."}
{"text":"Always have a good experience. Staff is also so so friendly and willing to be accommodating!!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Always. Either they aren't properly staffed or they are so worried about the drive thru that they completely ignore the people standing in front of them. Tonight we watched people walk out (they were tired of waiting) and not a single employee noticed. Clearly we all keep coming back but, now that there's a DQ at Westgate, I think we will at least move our business elsewhere. Customer service is important and this location is seriously lacking. And the best part? Once the line died down the employees came out to the lobby to play the claw machine game. Seriously?"}
{"text":"I visited this location for the Free (small) Cone Day today.  The only flavor / selection was vanilla soft serve with a 'paper-cup' cone, no other flavor or a sugar cone (which would've been yummy) for this special offer. I arrived after noon and it was not busy, just one customer before me and a few after.  Service was fairly quick and the manager(?) was polite and wore gloves while serving (they even had Purell near the register ;) ).  The place appeared clean; yet, \"old' like the neighborhood- but I guess that matches the appeal of the old DQ. This was my 1st visit, and I was surprised at how tiny this DQ was, like a (bigger) drive-thru Fotomat of yesteryears.  There were only 2 booths to sit at and tables / chairs out on the patio.  I just did the pickup. It was a rather warm day so an ice cream cone on the run provided a cooldown.  Thanks, DQ :)"}
{"text":"I waited over 30 minutes for a chicken strip basket. The person at the window was very unfriendly and had my card for about 10 minutes. My chicken was hot, but my fries very ice cold along with my bread which I think was supposed to be toast. The gravy was like water with no flavor at all. This Dairy Queen is awful and if I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Blizzard was fantastic as usual but.....the kid in the drive thru kept his gloves on and took my money, gave me change and then handed me my blizzard. I'm not sure if he took a food handlers class, which is required, but that's very unsanitary."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this Dairy Queen again, I normally don't write reviews about places. But I was so upset I felt the need to. The manager working, whose name tag said Chantel, was incredibly rude to me and my husband. She said the name of our blizzard wrong and confused us, then I asked her and she corrected me and I told her she confused me, then she said,\" I am just trying to do my job. \" I said,\" You don't need to be rude.\" Then she said,' Yes I do, I will be rude.\" She was super sassy and rude about the whole"}
{"text":"This place is a nice one to come and get ice cream with the family.  Clean and always good service.  My girls love their ice cream!!!!"}
{"text":"I met with mixed results here.  The large Original Orange Julius I ordered had a quite visible line of separation between the orange juice and the frothy effect desired in an Orange Julius, and was not very cold.  In fact, this was was one of the first times I did not get an ice cream headache drinking an Orange Julius too fast.  The large Butterscotch Dipped Cone I ordered was satisfying but looked like the leaning tower of Pisa, and did not project a strong butterscotch flavor.  The two staffers who served me me were efficient but not very friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Hot Eats, Cool Treats!\"   No but really, this DQ location is kind of in an awkward location right now only because there's construction going on right next door. Not to mention it looks dirty because it's really old... Just a suggestion to the ladies, DON'T use the bathroom!   However, if you're looking for a ice cream treat you can never go wrong here. As for the \"hot eats\" they're really good too and they're pretty big portions.   I would have to say especially in the summer this place gets really busy so it's not easy to find a parking spot.. and there's no drive-thru so that doesn't help the situation cause people will leave their cars idling while they run in for their family.   They also have seating outside in the back with picnic type tables which is fun to hang out, but again the construction causes a lot of dust so you might get a little dirty."}
{"text":"I go to this Dairy Queen quite often and every time I come the staff is often rude and they seem irritated to have to deal with a customer. However, last night my mom and I came in and the girl at the counter (she said her name is Savannah) was VERY nice. She was patient with my somewhat picky order and seemed happy to be serving us. 9/10 times my order comes out wrong, but she made sure it was exactly what I had ordered. She definitely deserves some recognition as she has excellent customer service skills and sets a good example for how the rest of the workers there should behave. She's the only reason I rated this with 4 stars."}
{"text":"Dipped cone all the way! This location is tricky because it gets very busy in the evenings. Best route, don't go in the drive-thru, park your car and order inside. It's quicker and easier!"}
{"text":"I am guilty of eating at this location from time to time as it is close to my home.   I have to say I normally like Dairy Queen! It takes me back to the 80's when life was easy breezy! Mmmmm Heath bar blizzard, such a treat!   Cherry dilly bar, mmmmm yummy!   My issue and complaint is THIS location only!   I finally decided to write my review to help others avoid this train wreck of an operation!   If I can save one person from eating at this location then I have done my duty!   Food is never made or cooked properly!   Corn dogs are still frozen in the middle.   Blizzards have very little mix ins! Always skimpy! If I order a snickers or heath bar blizzard, come on and put some in it!   Cheeseburger tasted fowl and I can't describe the taste and odor other than the memory of tossing it into a bin labeled TRASH.   Prices are high for the amount and quality of food you get.   The wait for food is ridiculous, after visiting a few times and waiting 20 minutes regardless of what I ordered I knew this place had issues.   I should have never returned after my first visit however I was open at the time to give them another shot. Always a long wait and disappointment in what I ordered.   This store is clearly a franchise, they are not playing by the rules that is for sure.   They cut corners beyond reason and it shows in their service and quality.   The staff at this location leaves a lot to be desired.   I have cut this location out as an option, it no longer exist to me.   The drive thru set up is ridiculous. Try driving in an inside circle and talking through a cup and string speaker system.   Stay away from this location!   They are only consistent in BAD.  This location has been written off of my list for good!"}
{"text":"I got a cherry Arctic Freeze float & the cherry flavoring was disgusting. It tasted like a packet of Kool-aid (minus the sugar) on top of ice cream. Inedible! The girl behind the counter was sweet about it, though, & gave me my replacement strawberry sundae at no charge. It was fine but the topping to ice cream ratio is all messed up. Not nearly enough topping! Bathrooms are filthy, which makes me nervous about food safety.  I used to come here all the time as a kid when there were limited ice cream options in Scottsdale. Nowadays there are so many amazing other places to go - like Sweet Republic or Menchie's frozen yogurt - there's no reason to ever go here."}
{"text":"Hey, I love my DQ!  My 'black and white' cone (chocolate and vanilla) is always good with the signature curl on top. Treated myself to an ice cream cake on Valentine's Day - worth every penny and I ate every bite."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again! Got charged 167 dollars for a meal that was 16 dollars. Had to call the bank since my account got overdrawn and didn't even get an apology. I used to come here all the time but they definitely lost my business for good."}
{"text":"Brought my four year old nephew and my grandparents here for ice cream and I definitely won't be back. This place is the size of a closet and has mostly only high top tables and is thus NOT kid friendly. Also they have no bathroom for customers which is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ordered an Oreo blizzard birthday cake 3 days in advance for my daughter's 12th Birthday from this location.  I figure 3 days will give them enough time, however, when I came to pick-up the cake on the day of my daughter's birthday I was so disappointed that the cake is NOT ready!  The staff went to the back & came out (without any cake on her hands) to tell me, \"I'm sorry but the staff didn't come in yesterday so the cake is not ready; well we need to pipe it and it will take 10 minutes.\"  Ten minutes passed and it's still not ready!!!  So I waited longer for a cake that should've been ready for pick-up cuz I ordered in advance!  This is not acceptable!  Then when I received the cake there was nothing special about it; the piping wasn't even done well & they got my order wrong!  Wanted dark pink writing not white!  Never again will I order here!  Even Baskin Robins make better cake than this!"}
{"text":"UPDATE : the rude woman is the owner.. how lovely.     Maybe tell the girl working there today with the blonde and brown short hair to not talk rudely to customers for \" walking away from the windows\" after she told me it was going to take a while to make a smoothie ( tasted horrible ) because she needed to wash the stuff. I walked away to give my boyfriend his ice cream and she yelled out the window in-front of if everyone \" next time don't walk away I can't tell there are other people here !\" With an attitude. I will not come back to the DQ in Bridgeville. I even have a lady behind me defend me and say \" who does she think she's talking to like that ?\" No need to spend my money on crappy service and food. Why don't you just quit if you hate people that much for no reason ? She's going to talk to the wrong person one day and get herself in trouble"}
{"text":"WOW - I love the salads from this Dairy Queen - always fresh and made to my specific request - but today's was the BEST!! I had to call to compliment them - Well done!!"}
{"text":"The Orange Julius premium smoothie is delicious. I wish everyone sold them. So yummy."}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service.  They barely acknowledge at you unless they are barking at you for money.  Then you get your food only to see they smashed your burger.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Surly old lady working the counter on my day and believe me, I caught the vibe quite clearly and won't be back.  Ice cream didn't taste quite right, and the Blizzard ingredients seemed stale and unchewable.  Yuck.  Tummy gurgles for an hour after consumption.  Not good."}
{"text":"Located in the old Bashas shopping center on the NW corner of 67th ave. & Deer Valley.  This is one of the cleaner DQ's in the valley, and it always has an upbeat feel because of the jukebox playing music constantly.  Service has been alright each visit, though some of the patrons are a bit difficult to look at.   I know, I know, it's just a DQ but this one isn't so bad."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to this location for years. Great kids working here and they have the right kind of dq soft serve (not the kind that is half air like some DQs serve). One thing though guys, the brand of peanut butter cups is pronounced \"Ree-sus\", not \"Ree-sees\"!"}
{"text":"Cleaning crew working hard- great but when same crew doesn't put on gloves and is handling my food that's not ok."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great ice cream and burgers friendly staff best DQ around looking forward to come back again"}
{"text":"The Mall Dairy Queen is very good.  No matter if you want a cone, sundae, Blizzard, or other product it usually comes out tasty and delicious!  Right off the food court.  Restrooms off the food court.  Good place to cool down after s long day of shopping."}
{"text":"Remodeled in February.  We've been there a couple times since then.  The neighbor loves their sandwich made with healthy turkey bacon.  Cones were crispy and not soggy.  Same great service inside and at the drive through. Plenty of soft seats inside."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen was slightly disappointing. I usually go through the drive thru because it is more convenient for me and I only live a few minutes away. However, upon receiving my blizzard at the drive thru, it was very melted.   I went there again yesterday and I was driving away when I realized that they forgot the most important part of my order: the ice cream! I went back and I had to go inside and when I got my ice cream, it was melted.   I still give 3 stars because although my ice cream was melted, it was still decent tasting."}
{"text":"On our way out of town, we saw the Hot Eats Cool Treats sign and thought it was our last chance at a burger before hitting the highway, so we pulled in and grabbed some food from some surly teens. Even for fast food, it was pretty brutal, and it turns out there were many better places to stop, including a Burgers Priest. Don't be a shmuck, keep looking... unless you're after ice cream. DQ knows their ice cream."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, the chicken strip basket was served with gravy and crispy Texas toast. At this location, gone is the gravy and the toast was warm and limp. Insert sad face. If only there was a time machine.  Fast food and I are on A-OK terms, and this locale is no different. The drive-thru service was fast and the lady taking the order was A-OK too.   The fries and chicken were still crispy and hot by the time I got home - so that's a win. And the blizzards are always upside down-licious. Butterfinger blizzard is my usual jam, but if you're feeling adventurous, I highly recommend mixing Oreo and strawberries. Your tastebuds will thank you for the unexpected combo."}
{"text":"Just had the worst peanut butter parfait in the world it was like a salt shaker was spilled into it I couldn't even finish it how disgusting! And irritating!"}
{"text":"This owner has his Spring Mt. closed he is Asian or Korean and has no respect for customers !!!!! Still waiting for my daughters cake that I paid $30.00 and still nothing !!!!"}
{"text":"We've brought our gift cards here 5 times but they have never accepted them, because their \"system is down.\" I went here tonight and the employee barely tried and so we left without ice cream again."}
{"text":"This location is convenient and that is why I gave it 1 star. Honestly every time I go here my order is wrong. I have come to the point where I make them repeat it back to me and they still mess the order up. I've even Gone to the point at the window to ask them if my order is correct they say \"yes of course\" I will get it and check it and it's wrong. I understand it gets busy but that doesn't mean serve your customer whatever the hell you want. I have allergies to foods and if it wasn't for me checking everything I eat DQ may have landed me in the ER more then once."}
{"text":"I mean as far as Dairy Queen's go I've never been to one that just knocked my socks right off my feet.  With that being said, this one isn't anything that I hated either.  I only went through the drive through, but I tell ya what....if you're driving in the night have your spot light out.  Their sign is either dim as all get out or it is just in fact...out.  The dessert was just as you'd expect...delicious!  :)  Can't complain about glorious ice cream with a brownie and hot fudge!    So overall, the location is good but it sure would be nice to be able to see it at night!"}
{"text":"I called this store on Friday 2/12/16 and inquired if they had the heart ice cream cakes that are advertised on TV for Valentine's Day.  I was told that they did so I drove over and picked out two cakes.  The guy that was working tried to charge me $28 for a cake that is advertised for $9.99 on Dairy Queen's website.  Then he said that he would sell them for $16.99 and I even pulled up the ad and showed him and he still refused.  He said that his owner said to sell them for the $16.99.  Today I got a call from the NEW owner and she told me that the price of the cake was $16.99 because she wasn't participating in the sale.  I told her that she is representing Dairy Queen and that is the way that most her business comes to her store because it is a Dairy Queen store.  I will never go to this Dairy Queen again.  Charging $16.99 for a $10 cake is outrageous!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is rude and unprofessional. While ordering at the drive thru the girl kept interrupting me and asking me \"is that all?\" No that's not all! Jeez let people order their ice cream. Then when we get up to the window and hand us our ice-cream, they give us the whole medal tray! Instead of the extra work to hand out each ice-cream. Wow! I think some training is much needed here. I don't remember having this issue a month ago. I think we'll just head over to McDonald's or cold stone from now on."}
{"text":"Always end up going here after lunch to get dessert!  This location is conveniently located right next to Subway and the Little Ceasars so once you are done stuffing your face at those 2 places, you can stuff it a little more with some ice cream.  The ladies that work at this DQ location are very nice and friendly... they'll even work with you if you are on the fence about a flavor.  I'm a big fan of the mini-blizzard sizes they just launched not too long ago. $2.50 and the blizzard isn't too big - you get your ice cream fix, maybe not an ice cream headache.... well I guess you can down it in one big bite and get one....  Figures today it was 32 degrees outside and we wanted ice cream after eating some spicy Thai food."}
{"text":"I always drive by this Dairy Queen and see the long line inside of it - It's just a small location (end-cap of a strip mall) and it doesn't help that the parking lot is crazy busy with Harris Teeter traffic.  The staff (mostly still in high school, etc) are friendly enough and do their best to handle the crowds.  It looks like the store was recently renovated to update the counters, tables, and chairs.  I do like the 'mini' blizzard they added to the menu.  On this recent trip to DQ, I got a mint oreo medium and it was plenty enough to give me a stomach ache after eating it.  Oh... hellz no I won't let a good blizzard go to waste regardless of my stomach issues!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this DQ.  I love the atmosphere of the older store...walk up only and no drive through.  My past visits have always been for the same thing - a banana split blizzard.  On tonight's visit I came away disappointed.  I remember when blizzards were made and before they handed it to you they turned it upside down to make sure it's a real blizzard and thick enough.  Not this time.  They had a lid on it and if they turned it upside down it would have dumped into the lid.  The blizzard was runny, there were large chunks of banana on top like they forgot to mix it in and it was messy.  When I took the top off, it overflowed.  If this is the quality you now get here, I may need to find a new late night ice cream place."}
{"text":"Came to this Dairy Queen location because I had a Groupon but was very surprised how great the service was. Very good customer service, very fast meal prep, meal made to perfection first time. Was called by my name and was well taken care of. Great experience"}
{"text":"Normally only get my Blizzard fix through the drivethru but have went in on occasion.. The employees are pretty nice and quick. Only had one bad Blizzard here as I think some of the pieces had some ice or something on them as I had some crunchiness in my ice cream, which wasn't good.. but normally always good."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it less stars!! Workers were very friendly but food was absolutely terrible. My chicken strips were the exact same size as my chapstick in my purse. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Alway have awful service. Tonight was the last straw when the 4 kids were complaining about having to take food out to customers. There were 10 people waiting at the counter.  I was told it took so long to get my food because one of the staff members drank my shake. Seriously get some kind of management people"}
{"text":"Stopped here after dinner one evening for an ice cream cone for dessert. The ice cream cone was everything that you would expect from Dairy Queen. The ice cream is rich and creamy. However, every time that I visit this location to me it seems DIRTY. I think part of it is that it is in desperate need of a remodel. But, everything just has a grungy/sticky feeling to me. The plaza that this is located in recently underwent some upgrades with The Fresh Market moving into the plaza. Hopefully Dairy Queen will follow suite and put some money into updating this location."}
{"text":"Love the $5 lunch Fast friendly service in the restaurant and the drive thru  Staff is always great The 2 older ladies are fabulous"}
{"text":"Even though they are friendly at this location, nothing can make me give them a another star.  I order the chicken lunch special and it was terrible. First of all the box was big with only a lil inside... ok I get its going to be cheaper, but it was like I ordered a kids meal.. the piece of chicken were so small and prob equivalent to 1regular size chicken strip, what a jip!!!  The gravy taste like nothing,  really wishing I had some ranch for my dry overly breaded pieces of freezer burn chicken strips... This will surely be the last time I order for here, I will stick to their imitation ice cream when I am in the mood for a  artifical sugar high"}
{"text":"My blizzards have always been great! And then employees at this location are very friendly.  (very sad there is no more cotton candy blizzards!)"}
{"text":"I love the cherry dipped cones!  Still sad they got rid of the cotton candy blizzard- was my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"When I need a sweet treat I go through this drive thru for a blizzard. I hate to admit it but I've tried multiple varieties of blizzard flavors, and every time I leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem here. I come in, give my order, and get my dessert. I would say they need to do something about customer service. The girls who work here seem like they don't enjoy it. I always get blank stares and it's not really friendly environment. But, the ice cream is just as any other DQ would be. Their swirls aren't as good as other DQs I've been too. Kinda sloppy. But regardless, wouldn't need to expect much effort from these kind of ice cream stores."}
{"text":"I don't who is the dude that keeps messing with the customers, but it's funny as shit!  The first time I went thru the drive food, I ordered a kids meal. After I ordered, the drive thru voice came back and told me that they didn't have any food. I was like \"what? No food? The hell?\" After a minute, he said he was joking. Tonight, I was with a friend and he ordered a blizzard and a cone at the drive thru, and the voice came back and said, \"there's no more ice cream.\"  We were like, \"what?\" And he repeated it again \"we ran out of ice cream.\" We didn't know what to do with ourselves.  Well my heart felt that familiar sinking that Urbana champaign does so well to me (aka break my heart). Then the voice came back and said \"just kidding\" and we got our ice cream. Phew. But it was funny as hell!!! I still can't stop giggling at our reaction. Lol. Go there just so you can get messed with. It's funny."}
{"text":"I wanted to go in the drive-thru line, but it had too many cars lined up for the lot size, so I parked and actually got out of my car. Very difficult location to park in, but I made it! ha ha   Went inside, was greeted at the counter by a cashier in training. No problem. Luckily, I was not in a hurry and I have compassion for anyone trying to learn. I ordered the special advertised: 2 Double Cheeseburgers for $3.49, plus the 2 side orders for $3.00 (a reg. size fries and a side salad). I paid and since it was \"to go\", I was asked to wait for my number to be called. It took a little while (probably 5 minutes), but was handed my bundled bag of yummies with a smile and thank you. I did have to ask for croutons and a dipping sauce for the fries, but, that did not bother me. I was a little disappointed that the only salad dressing that appealed to me was the \"French\" dressing -   WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING????   I have to ask that of nearly every restaurant I go to!!   Well, that being said, my dining partner and I left the Dairy Queen - noticed the drive-thru was empty by this time. Wow! Next time...    And there WILL be a next time. Once home, the bag was opened, and the salad was small, but tasty and fresh, as were the fries. I was very impressed with the Double Cheeseburgers --   NOT AT ALL LIKE THE WEAK PHOTOS IN THEIR POSTER ADS!!  These DQ Double Cheeseburgers were BIG, not only with ketchup and pickles -- but, piled high with FRESH tomato, red onion rings and lettuce!! VERY impressive for the bargain price!!   Overall, I will return sooner -- rather than later! :)"}
{"text":"I made my cake order on 6/16 ..3 days ago says they only need a day to make it. I call today before I get all the way over there and he ask when it's suppose to be ready I tell him 30 minutes ago.  Its not decorated and the decorator won't be there for 45 minutes or so. So I wait a hour get down here .. Its still not ready. The one doing the decorating .. Tim I believe super nice but why isn't it done. He then tells me he doesn't want it to melt when I walk out side so I should wait a few minutes. Fine.. Still the guy is super nice about it. I order a iced coffee to wait ... The guy in the back comes out with my coffee. Please see the picture this is ridiculous. For one he put spoon in it. Like its a blizzard.  I asked for a different top because it's a blizzard top on a LIQUID spillable drink he gives me a attitude and says that is the only top that fits. Why do you have a attitude with me. Quit if you don't like it. Look at the picture please. And it's not sweet .. Its bitter ....  supposed to be a salted iced Carmel coffee.Now I get my cake .. May 15 minutes not too long .. However the decorations are supposed to be green ... They are blue... Horrible experience. Last time customer at this location. Wish I hadn't of paid ahead."}
{"text":"Ice cream was good. Extremely bad customer service! Made a big deal about giving me an extra to go cup. No offense but I really don't want to have to explain my reasoning behind getting a bigger cup to go. Stupid."}
{"text":"short and sweet...cause its an ice cream place...get it?   \"what keeps you coming back\"   its on the way home...ha!  in all honesty a really great location, with speedy service and all of the treats you could ask for inside one location. there is one negative, with starbucks just next door, the parking lot and driving area is fairly crowded. otherwise its a fantastic alternative and a great bonus due to the fact its outside of a mall."}
{"text":"What an amazing disappointment! I ordered a specialty blizzard, something I have ordered from several different DQ's. This store has a fowl smell upon entrance as well as an unclean environment. I should have turned and left as soon as I noticed the shady handy man with a cane and a moon boot destroying the dry wall and a table by the door, however the clerk told us how he was fixing the table for them. My review is for the fact that I paid nearly six dollars for a blizzard that had hardly any toppings and no flavor of the flavor I paid extra for. The clerk remade my blizzard due to my complaint only to hand me the exact same blizzard that I just returned. I will not return to this location due to the fact they could have appeased me by adding a few extra toppings but wouldn't with an explanation of \"I don't want to get fired\" I had to leave without my $6 and without a blizzard out of complete frustration!"}
{"text":"It is one of the older and stranger DQ's.  They have the standard ice cream treats that all Dairy Queens serve.  Place is relatively clean and the staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"When you decide to cheat but the cherry and butterscotch coating on a cone is terrible!!!! It's been a while since we were at this place but now know it's not worth it"}
{"text":"Went for a quick ice cream as needed that pick me up. Ordered a chocolate dip cone and a large vanilla cone. Their large looked like a medium as other dairy queens make it better and the ice cream had frozen bits inside.  Will not visit the Dufferin location again. Usually we go to Newmarket or Markham location which is great but we were in Downsview so that's why we visited the Dufferin location. Bad location."}
{"text":"I stopped here and I will not be returning to this Dairy Queen location. The young lady  who attended the counter had an attitude problem and I received very bad customer service.  You could tell that she did not want to be at work, but when you work in customer service you're supposed to conceal if you actually feel that way. I had asked for a mini size blizzard and she rang up a small and I said I would like a mini please again, which is the smallest size that they offer. When I corrected her she then sighed, looked annoyed, and said well, you asked for a small. It was a simple miscommunication, but instead of letting it go she had an attitude that she had to ring it up again. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love my little neighborhood Dairy Queen! I've been coming here for years. The employees are cheerful and the place is kept clean. It has a little outside patio that you can eat at!"}
{"text":"It's a small location. The milk shakes were good. The employees frequently do not tip the blizzards upside down before serving it you like they are supposed to. This location is not a DQ Brazer (hot food). They also sell Orange Julius. The employees sometimes act like they do not care to be there. I have had frequent issues when using coupons. Had the manager tell us that a coupon was not for that location and it was. I only go there when I have a coupon. Would not pay full price for their negative attitudes."}
{"text":"We just had the most frustrating experience at this DQ.  The drive-thru line was very long, so we decided to go inside.  We ordered 2 medium blizzards and 2 vanilla cones.  A pretty simple order, that took 25 minutes!  The blizzards were more like a cup of vanilla ice cream with hardly any mix in ingredient and one was a small when we ordered 2 mediums! Not sure what the issue was but they were a hot mess tonight.  Some people gave up waiting and just left....others were standing around grumbling over poor service.  We are happy to have DQ in TC, but they obviously need to get it together!!"}
{"text":"I woukd give this place negative stars is possible.   The management must be complexity oblivious as to how to run an establishment.   Tonight is the  final time I will visit this place.    Everytime I come here the drive thru speaker is impossible to communicate on.  The staff is not very friendly and it takes 30-40 min everytime I go.  Went tonight and the drive thru was wrapped around the building blocking the drive way so we went inside and it was straight chaos.  People everywhere with messed up orders and after almost 8 min we were not even acknowledge so we left.   Horrible horrible horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The service is just terrible here. Several times I've seen the workers invite their friends to the back, making shakes or blizzards. They had me waiting 20 minutes for an orange Julius!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location. We ordered 2 hot dogs, a sundae and a blizzard.  We wanted the blizzard made with chocolate ice cream and were told they don't have it. So we said okay, vanilla is fine. Then the cashier goes to make the hot dogs, and the other person working tells her not to make them because the kitchen was closed (we saw her even take out the hot dogs and then put them back). After we got the desserts and ordered a sandwich from subway, we discovered the turtle sundae didn't have caramel, and the oreo blizzard had almost nothing but vanilla ice cream. Very disappointing service. It's better to go to the other restaurants in the food court."}
{"text":"This place is always busy!  The girls working there are very friendly and always get my order right! Not that I order anything complicated or anything.  They do have a drive-thru as well.  This is one of the Grill & Chill places that serves burgers, hotdogs, salads, and sammiches too, although the sign outside doesn't indicate that.    This place is less than a mile from my house, so it's convenient when I get a Blizzard craving."}
{"text":"Very small \"large\" sundaes in my opinion. Food is very mediocre."}
{"text":"When you are a place like DQ, you have reputation to live up to. To many, Dairy Queen is a treat from their childhood. It was a place of celebration after a win or a cone of commiseration after a loss. For me, it was also a place I could ride my bike with my friend and get my childhood favorite, a chocolate dipped ice creme cone.  I saw on the news, that Dairy Queen was celebrating the unofficial end of summer today by giving away a free small Ultimate Oreo Frappe. The giveaway ran from 2pm until 5pm coinciding with their daily 'happy hour' when is it normally discounted $2. Sounded like a great excuse on a 101° day to go. I got caught in traffic on route and arrived at 4:58pm. I waited in line, and got to the counter when my phone said 5pm. At a place like Dairy Queen, I expected a smile and my free Frappe. I instead got attitude, whole lot of attitude. Looking at the other reviews, I see this is standard policy at this occasion. I showed them my phone still said 5pm and they very begrudgingly made me one. However, not without what I assume was the manager both cursing out an employee in English for not locking the door and I assume me in Spanish for my insistence on thosr honoring the deal.  I enjoyed the Frappe, but the terrible customer service knocked this location down from a 4 star taste to a 2 star experience."}
{"text":"I often come here for a quick and affordable lunch. Sometime the chicken takes what seems to be forever to cook but I would rather wait then have raw chicken."}
{"text":"I like this place they had great customer service and the manager was super nice and helpful unfortunately didn't get his name but he had glasses thank you dude"}
{"text":"The most awkward drive-thru I've EVER seen. It's kind of annoying to make that very tight turn into the drive thru line, but what I won't do for ice cream.   I've been here on a handful of occasions and it does the trick when I've craving some dairy goodness. I usually get a dipped cone, but they have two new flavors to choose from - cherry and butterscotch. I tried the butterscotch, but I'll probably stick to the tried and true chocolate next time. Haven't tried any of their food items. I strictly come here for dessert, usually after dinner in Chinatown.   Good for what it is."}
{"text":"Worst food and customer service ever..... They try and change you for a large ice cream and give you a small.. they have done this more then once to us. Do not recommend this location"}
{"text":"This was a day I decide..........what the heck, awe extra carbs will probably not kill me. I never get anything but their Blizzard. A pecan cluster. This one was just the way I like it. Mixed well. Sometimes they will just get mixed on top and not all way to bottom.  Most Dairy Queen's seem to need some up dating. Clean but tables chairs counters showing some wear.  The people that wait on you are usually very friendly."}
{"text":"I like Blizzards.  I have lived in Arizona for 42 years. I might be wrong but I believe this DQ has been at that location for those 42 years. Maybe not that long but almost.  It is a small, small shop. There is no more than 3 tables in this location. I have never eaten inside. We just order and leave.  About once a month my wife on her way to her parents house she will stop and get her dad and mom a Blizzard. She is the favorite daughter. If I am with her I also get to have one. I like the pecan caramel one. Which I call the pecan cluster. You will notice they don't call it that anymore. Some sort of copy right on the name.  The place while it may not look clean. What it needs is a facelift."}
{"text":"We do not usually go to this Dairy Queen, just not in the right direction from our house.  We only go here to get Blizzards. Everyone has their favorite, mine is the pecan cluster.  Everyone was nice and the Blizzards were just what the Doctor ordered."}
{"text":"Went there right after they open up got two mushroom and Swiss burglars both were terrible the sauce me and wife agree was spoil said wont go back even tho it's closer then spring mountain that never had bad food.. Then riding today passing by rainbow Dairy Queen decided to get one chile cheese hot dog went in guy took my order and it took almost 15 minutes for it others came in after me got banana splits before I got my order so to say I won't be back spring mountain is worth the extra drive.."}
{"text":"Like others have said: EXTREMELY SLOW service. Avoid at all costs, unless you go through the drive-thru. They seem to get priority over those ordering in the lobby.   Today took 15 minutes to get a small vanilla cone!  DQ is famous for their frozen treats and they couldn't even get a simple ice cream cone out in a reasonable manner. Spoke to the cashier and was given the excuse that it was a trainee making the cones and Blizzards. A man carrying his small daughter, who ordered immediately after me, walked out because they got sick of waiting for their dessert order. I complained to the manager who was manning the drive thru, he barked out orders to the 2 kids operating the soft serve machine. They seemed to just ignore it. I was fuming at this point and practically yelled at the manager that I just wanted my damn cone! He finally had to do it himself. I called the owner, whose number is listed under the store hours on the front door. I told the Asian man (I'm Asian too) how long the order took and that the ones being trained on the soft-serve machine need retraining. He apologized and said he'd make sure to make it better for our next visit. Unfortunately I won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"This is one of the newest DQ's around.  They are also one of the most busiest yet most efficient locations.  Every time we go here, no matter what time of day or night, there is a ridiculous line in the drive through, you would swear it was In-N-Out at lunchtime.  Luckily the staff is able to move very quickly through all those customers.  On every visit there I have found the cashiers to be quite friendly.  The majority of the people who work here are high school kids, but they all seem to have a pretty good time.  Their blizzards are some of the better ones here, and they tend to get them mixed pretty well all the way to the bottom.  Sometimes you get a little cheated on the mix-ins and sometimes they are generous, but it's usually pretty consistent.  If you can, see if Jeff can make your blizzard, they're the best.  That was a shameless plug for my little bro, but he really does make a killer blizzard."}
{"text":"Got there just before a line formed. Employees were friendly and quick with the orders."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this any less than 5 stars is because there is always a huge line. But beside the food which I hope no one orders the ice cream is always good."}
{"text":"No chicken fingers at this location no frys or toast as well? I got the chicken sandwich and it's terrible. Cost me $9"}
{"text":"Smells like BO.  Employees are filthy, scowl-faced, and slow.  Is usually inhabited by squadrons of hysterical teenagers.  But it's a dairy queen!  A blizzard is delicious, no matter where it comes from.  And it's conveniently located by the savoy 16 movie theater, so when your 9:15 showing of Summer Blockbuster is sold out, and you have to wait for the 9:25, you can wait with a waffle cone to get you appetized for your 9,000 oz movie popcorn."}
{"text":"Their drive thru service is great. We ordered a corn dog, ice cream and a bizzard and they all taste wonderful"}
{"text":"This dairy Queen is right by the arcade of the Excalibur Casino (smart placement lol). This dairy Queen did not have chocolate ice cream when I went! Not sure if they were out or if it is because it was such a small location."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a worse score I would.   Every time my family and I go here something always goes wrong.  The employees are terrible!  They don't listen and screw something up every visit. They don't give us the right blizzards or they mess up the sizing.  Then it takes them a lifetime to come up with a solution by then we give up and leave with our destroyed orders.  Save your sanity and keep your happiness of having a family treat by going to another location at all costs.  This one needs to be overhauled from manager down. Just go to the one by Green Valley high school or Boulder City."}
{"text":"It takes 15+ minutes to make fries here. Isn't this supposed to be fast food? They were very rude and the one hot fudge sundae I did get had barely any hot fudge on it (I'm talking like a small drizzle), when I asked for more, the chick told me she had put extra on.... UH HUH. The workers zombie around the place moving at the speed of snails, and when I finally do get my 'hot' food, it's lukewarm at best. The ice cream tastes good, but it's the same at every location so I can't really give that to them. I avoid this Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Rude service. They don't accept coupons and they are incredibly disrespectful to their customers. You are better off getting mcdonalds mc flurries! Steer clear of this terrible establishment."}
{"text":"I visited this dairy queen today because I really had a taste for a Peanut Buster Parfait. The only thing I ever get when I go to ANY Dairy Queen is their Peanut Buster Parfait... This was my first time ordering anything from this location, and I will have to say it will be my last! I was completely disappointed with the Parfait! It tasted NOTHING like what I was used to having at Dairy Queen. The hot fudge that was on my parfait didn't taste anything like the hot fudge that I normally get from Dairy Queen. I was so disappointed because I really had my taste buds set on what I usually taste, but I was completely underwhelmed.  I'm not sure if Dairy Queen changed their hot fuge recipe or what, but whatever I had today was not good at all. I just kept saying literally\" This is not Dairy Queen hot fudge.\" It was very thick and barely had any flavor to it. It tasted like cheap hot fudge. Like i said before, I will not be returning this particular location again. I rarely ever post a yelp review, but I had to concerning this disappointing experience."}
{"text":"While the ice cream is alright (really not that special outside of blizzard and ice cream cake), I have to give credit to the consistency of the hot food served here.  Whether it's ordered in the afternoon or late at night -- burgers, fries, chicken strips, and other items are served hot and fresh at this location for fairly reasonable prices. For those living in this corner of campus, it's quite convenient to have this option available within walking distance without having to drive along the busy roads.  As for flavor -- it's really no better nor worse than going to McDonalds or Burger King, but the fresher preparation really does make a difference in experience. Ingredient quality is fairly good as well, as I've not had old tomatoes, dry bread, nor wilted lettuce here.   If you're driving by this part of campus and need some fast food to eat, this Dairy Queen is one of the better options in the area."}
{"text":"This is the closest DQ to our home and we visit fairly often.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Today they went above and beyond though.  I asked if they had any \"pink\" ice cream.  I have a 2 year old baby girl and that's what she asked for.  At first, they said no, just vanilla.  I figured out a compromise, because cookie dough is heavenly, and didn't think much more of it.  The gentleman serving me went above and beyond and added food coloring to my daughters ice cream!  Pink it is!  Whenever someone goes above and beyond it stand out!  Excellent job DQ!  We will be back more often in the future!  You made my daughters day, and mine too!"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered three blizzards. One of them barely had any Oreos in it and was mainly just the ice cream. Let's put it this way. You could only see specks of Oreos. Like a grain of dirt, small. The only reason I didn't give one star is because the mini was made right. By the time I got home I was too pissed off to go back. Not to mention the wait was crazy. Might want to consider hiring more people."}
{"text":"The obvious is DQ ice cream is always good so that's not in question.  As for this location, been here once and my review is solely based on the kid running the intercom.  He was untrained, unclear, and impolite.  We were happy with our order but there's plenty of other ice cream spots to choose from with better service."}
