{"text":"Songs are new! It is just $11 per person during happy hour, from 4 to 8pm. Good deal!"}
{"text":"Did not like the experience at all. We were in the lounge  open area.  No services!  We had to order the drinks at the bar,  walk to the front to pay and get a receipt then head back to the bar with proof of receipt then we got our drinks which we had to carry to our own table! Definitely do not recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has great song selection for English songs and Chinese songs. I love that they take song requests to add their collection if you didn't find it. Some songs aren't classified properly so are hard to find but the system mostly works well. 

I always look for good sound acoustics in the rooms and this place does for most of their small rooms. There was only one medium sized room with lots of echo and feed back.

Service is usually pretty prompt for drinks and orders. Nothing special about their food as with usual karaoke places. Drinks are not the worst I've experienced at ktvs.

The only thing I really dislike is the membership fee. I did buy it for one year but felt like I needed to exclusively use this place since I had a membership so after it expired, I decided to explore other places that don't tie you down."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was for my birthday. We got the largest room, which also had its own private washroom and was very convenient. The karaoke system is easy to use (touch screen menu) and I appreciate the privacy the staff gives you. If you do need them, there is a call button. 

I personally like this karaoke lounge better than Bar+ (located in Toronto). Although, Bar+ has a bit more updated songs. The interior of the rooms in Ten 23 have a very modern feel. They also have their own private parking lot. I usually come here in large groups, so I call in to reserve a room ahead of time.

This is my favorite karaoke lounge thus far. The only downsides would be that their songs could be a bit more updated. For example, Back to Back- Drake, Where Ya at -Future, etc. I wish there was one in Mississauga!!! :("}
{"text":"My friend and I went for Happy Hour at Ten23 yesterday afternoon because we had to let out some steam (we both had a stressful week). It was a pretty good deal. $8.99 per person from 4 to 8:30PM. And it includes two non alcoholic drinks. (IE Lemon ice tea, lemons water, coke etc, ice tea, etc)

We didn't make reservations. Walked in and got a pretty large room probably houses 6-10people. The microphones were wireless and it glows when you turn it on. To select your song you can either use the remote or press the touch screen monitor. You can also set up your android too as the remote. The room was clean. You can adjust lights to your desired dimness. (There's no disco ball. Normally Korean karaoke places have it.) We paid the $10 membership fee which last for entire year. If you choose to not get the membership, each time you visit ten23 you must pay additional $5 fee.

We arrived at 4:30PM and couldn't believe the two of us sang for four hours. We sung English songs. And had so much fun Singing old Backstreet Boy and Spice Girl songs.

If you choose to sing other languages they do have Taiwanese, mandarin, Korean, Japanese and even Vietnamese songs.

Washrooms were clean. Overall the environment was nice and the service was good. Lol we bought membership so we will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I went there with my classmates and we really had a good time in this place.

The room we booked was a little small, but I think the atmosphere was good enough and there so much delicious for us to choose. So many Chinese songs and English songs can make me to feel like sit in a Chinese KTV and have fun with each other.

What's more, as Jessica, one friend of mine, said she used to go there and remarked it as one must go place in her plans, that is exactly for the price of that. We have 6 members but we only paid 155 for hole.

That's all about my review about this place. Hope you guys can also have a good time in there if you haven't gone there or even haven't heard about that."}
{"text":"3 stars

This spot used to be car hang out back in the day called Dr. Inks... those were my glory days, late nights, Fast and the Furious was all the rage and now I'm back, to do some karaoking?  Weird. Anyways I digress, I was inspired by a 90s UYE Karaoke event that happened a few days ago at Bar+ downtown with the Yelpers so this was a continuation of my new found interest. :p

We arrived and there was no one at the front desk. I walk inside towards resto/bar, take a look around there's nobody there either, patrons or staff. I hear Cantonese singing coming from a room and bass thumping. People are definitely here. I wondered though were the staff karaoking too??!!

Anyways I walk back the front desk, decide to call the number on their business card. 'Ring, Ring.  \"Hello?\" 
\"Yeah I'm at the front\", I exclaim. I peer back in and look towards the bar, I now  see the guy I was talking to, he's on a cordless phone and he starts walking up to the front desk.


How it works:

Happy hour until 8:30pm for $8.99 which includes 2 non-alcoholic drinks. 
We started at 6pm. 2.5hr of fun ahead. Glee! :)
They do charge a $5 dollar fee on top for non-members (applies to the group) 


The Experience:

He walked us to a small room. Sufficient but I wouldn't want to have more than 4 people in here though. 

Everything did function without a problem; the system was intuitive, menu organized by group, male, female, top hits, by language. Cordless mics worked but they did make a slight buzz near my BlackBerry. Cordless mic are good though for those are times to add in your own dance choreography.. \"Hammer Time\" lol Remote control volume and pitch controls worked and they provide sanitary disposable mic covers too. 

They wasn't an extensive catalog of English songs compared to Bar + but they did have a sprinkling of current hits like Adele's Skyfall. The karaoke music videos were either a) combination of real music video with lyrics, b) sometimes just the music video itself (you gotta look up the lyrics on your Smartphone have a data plan),c) the real cheese factor wtf is going on videos stuff like a blond lady with big hair modeling at a beach or mountain scene with a family in pajamas walking through a path? 

They do have an app if you're so tech inclined but we didn't bother with it so I don't know how it is. 

Anyways time flies when you're having fun. 30min to go, we get barged in and the bill is delivered. Nearing the end your queue of songs disappears. There way of saying goodbye it's time to collect. 

Lots of fun. Everything worked. They could improve on having more up to date English song/artist selections. The price was reasonable. I wasn't wowed. Compared to Bar+ downtown it's 3 stars. I'm new at this Karaoking so I'm still comparing and contrasting the places. I plan to visit a lot more places. :)"}
{"text":"Don't come here. Bad service, bad system.

The room was originally reserved for 15, but ended up only having 10 so we asked for a smaller room with a lesser minimum charge. They told me they had to check and after 5 minute and they discussed and told me there was no smaller room left.... which was bullshit because there was no one there. But whatever we tried and accepted it.

When we went in to our room, we were impressed, it was a nice room. However, the sound system kept ringing whenever we sang and at times our voices will get cut off and people from other rooms voices took over and our microphones will stop working and all we would hear is people from other rooms. 

When the bill came they ended up charging us for more, we were told that that when we get a bottle all the chase were free but they ended up for all the chase. 15$ each... and we ordered 4. 60 $ extra. That is not right. 

Overall, bad place you'll just scammed if you're not careful."}
{"text":"$8.99 for Happy Hour from 4:00-8:30PM! Reserve a room in advance, or those singing sessions in the shower are going to go to waste! 

You get two free drinks of your choice during Happy Hour. They're generally emptier during weekdays, and low on staff. My drink did not arrive for a good 20-minutes. 

The microphones here seem to always run low on battery, and sometimes cause the speakers to start screeching. I suggest that they do some interior renovations - the seats, television and washroom are starting to look very run-down. 

The song selection is decently filled with recent songs, and there's a good mix of Mandarin/English/Cantonese artists. 

You can't be picky about Asian karaoke places in Canada. Ten23 is my go to place if RQ is packed - however, both places are quite similar in my opinion. 

Tip: Try not to order alcohol here (If possible). The drinks are severely watered down in Karaokes."}
{"text":"The song selection here seems pretty updated and the pricing is very reasonable. Their service is very prompt and the rooms are clean. However, I find that the drinks aren't made very well (both alcoholic and non-alcohol drinks). When we ordered our food and drinks, the person taking the order said he would remember everything so he didn't have to write it down, but he didn't remember everything."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of Karaoke. Who hasn't busted out a tune in the shower, in the car, randomly when your favorite song comes on. Adding to that, you have a screen with lyrics (so you don't have to fill in gaps with na-na-na to those parts you DON'T know:p), a microphone, and a sound system that makes any inner Katy Perry come out.

The experience was less than fulfilling, and most likely, it was because I was feeling sick and there was no alcohol.

We came on a Sunday at 12pm. The sunny skies were calling to me (after a week of cloud and rain), but I ventured into a dark neon-room to sing. What immediately hit me was a stench of smoke. You know, like when someone smokes in a room and no matter how much ventilation happens, that grimey smell still lingers? 

We were a fairly big group of 10ish and there are only two microphones. This means that you really have to wait your turn, or, you could just belch out loud any song, but you could do that anywhere. The deal is that for $20, you also get a meal and a non-alcoholic drink. The food is mainly your typical Hong Kong Café style food and I opted for Rice with Egg and Pork, Taiwanese style. We got our food 1.5 hour after singing, and after eating a couple of spoonfuls, I was feeling really nauseous. The smokey air also didn't help at all so I had to leave and get fresh air.

But, by that time, the damage was done. I couldn't stomach going back in the dark room inhaling second hand smoke (or that is what it smelled like anyways) so I left earlier.

I think Karaoke is something to do at night (when the sun is gone) and when you're trashed. Private bathroom in our room which was clean, thank goodness."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.

I first heard some great reviews from my friend who goes to karaoke a lot. Later I hopped online and checked out their website a few times. The design was so sleek and beautiful! It couldn't possibly be a crappy place, right?

My friend booked a reservation for 9 and we got there. The nice decor sucked me right in. It doesn't matter that the booth is impossibly small or that their menu terribly expensive. It was pretty and that alone mattered. We spent about 2 hours singing and dancing awkwardly in the closet-sized room. Then some of my friends had to leave early and they went to get the bill.

They come back and told us apparently we were being charged a hundred and sixty dollars. \"What? Wasn't it supposed to be sixty dollars?\"

\"No, apparently it's $120 on weekends, plus a service charge.\"

\"But you never told us.\"

\"We probably told you when you made the reservation.\"

\"I swear I didn't hear it when I made the reservation.\"

\"Then it was a mutual miscommunication. In that case we'll only charge you a measly $116.\"

No, it wasn't a mutual miscommunication. You didn't tell us the price upfront, your glitchy website didn't even tell us the price. And just to let future customers know, they charge $120 on weekends, which turns out to be around $160 including all the fees, for a karaoke closet that fits six people maximum."}
{"text":"Not at all happy with the service here. I'm used to garbage service at karaoke places, but this was probably the worst I've ever experienced. If you get here with half a bubble tea or can of Pepsi, expect to not be allowed in until you've chugged it down or thrown it in the garbage.. Don't expect service with a smile either.

They demand to see everyone in your room's ID gestapo-style before getting your alcoholic drink. I have no real problem with this, but they really seem to have a bad attitude when they ask. In addition, if you book a time slot, they come in for last call orders ONE HOUR AND A HALF before your time's up! That's right. 1.5 hours before your time's up, you are cut off. After this you cannot order anything...even if you have an hour left and are thirsty. RIDICULOUS!!!!!

Won't be coming back here!  They really are alcohol Nazis and I really can't deal with that. You're better off elsewhere. Rooms are nice and clean. The only real positive I have is that it's a reasonable price to stay for 4.5 - 5 hours. But I'd rather pay a few dollars more not to feel like I'm under police control in North Korea. Go to Chinatown instead."}
{"text":"We booked a room during Afternoon-K (4-8:30pm) for a group of about 15 people. Room was nice and spacious and came with a private washroom but had a really strong piss odour. Decent selection of English songs and some of the newer popular songs. There were only 2 microphones for all of us, so lots of taking turns. The Afternoon-K comes with 2 drinks, but took a while for them to come after we ordered them.

Overall, could have been better."}
{"text":"songs are pretty new but service is bad, very bad. Staff there is rude, everything needs to be repeated  more than twice until processed he he"}
{"text":"This place is a money grab with horrible customer service. My friends and I went there for karaoke (there were 3 of us), the front desk person said that there were no 3-people rooms available, and that we must pay the price for 4 people in order to use a 4-people room, even though it was only 4 pm, and we could only hear 1 group of guests singing. His attitude was absolutely terrible. Still, there were no other places around there to go, so we agreed to it. After we were done and trying to pay, we wanted the bill to be split 3-way, however, he said that only 2 people can pay by debit card, and the third person must withdraw cash from their ATM. Which I thought was total BS, because if there were more groups paying one after another, then is it fair to say that only the first 2 groups can pay by card? I should think not. 

P.S. The drinks were just horrid, I wouldn't be surprised if they pissed in them."}
{"text":"Ugh, they changed their system here, and now instead of a remote - there is a touch screen system. Meaning you have to go up to the front of the room (or to the corner) in order to choose your songs. 

The system itself is okay, has lots of features, but seems to crash a lot. It's so difficult to find songs, especially since they are not in a list format, and you'll have to scroll pages and pages side ways to see what they have. Nor are they listed in alphabetical order (for English songs). 
There is a way to filter for language and artist, but takes a bit of time to figure out how. 

They used to have a phone app, but seems to be gone since the upgrade. I really hope they add that back in to help with navigation and choosing songs. It required so much effort otherwise. 

There are more choices in English songs with this new system though. Lots of great classics like Queen and Journey which I couldn't find before. Lots of recent popular songs are in there too, but harder to find if you don't know the name of the artist. Couldn't find Let It Go, the group was disappointed. 

We come here a lot for lunch K , a great $10.00 deal that include 3.5 hours, and a substantial lunch. After this experience, we might consider somewhere else next time we have an itch to sing."}
{"text":"Service was alright. Changed the system to touch screen to choose songs and to get service. it was neat in the beginning but got a headache afterwards. lol. Room was clean and spacious.  Overall, I would come back but get someone else to choose songs for me!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place for a long time in the past, but recently due to new management or new policies this is on my no fly list at this point. They changed the happy hour to 3 hours of singing, increased the prices for it, and also they added a mandatory \"non membership day pass\" which is ridiculous. this place now charges you $5 for not being a member? which cost $10 to be a member. and they also like to tack on mandatory tips even for 2 people. The fact that the service has always been bad is something, i think at this point it made sense how when i went on a Saturday they basically were empty there were 2 groups thats it. and they still managed to get drinks wrong for 2 people. Overall avoid this place like the plague, they now find anyway to charge fees on top of fees for no real reason. and with the increased pricing, and reduced service. your looking at $15 a person for happy hour instead of the previous $8 and only can sing for 3 hours max, in a scheduled set time. 

i recommend everyone go elsewhere, this place is no longer the great deal it used to be. and i used to come here all the time bringing in groups of 20-30 people."}
{"text":"Room 12 was our assigned booking spot as we walked pass the door pass a Breathalyzer on the wall and towards the reception where EVERYONE gets ID no matter how mature I look. 

A room enough for 8 we sat at a comfortable distance on the sofa bench from the LCD and started to choose songs and sing with the REMOTE microphones that seem to have technical difficulties from time to time and I wasn't sure if the remotes might cross signals or what but the service came in to fix it whenever we requested.  Nothing out of the ordinary for Karaoke spot especially some washroom mishaps, etc...

We snacked on Fried Tofu, Chicken Wings, Wasabi Cucumber, Deep Fried Squid Balls which were actually tasty considering that this is a Karaoke spot but then you have to realize this isn't just for Karaoke but they promote their Lunch and Dinner as well. TIP: Skip that Cucumber item, I have no idea who would order that. 

It is a bit on the pricey side as if you are at an attraction and have to pay the premium price to eat inside the establishment like places of amusement(Theme Parks) or entertainment(Theatres). Everything came out Fast and Hot, which made the Asian-style Deep Fried Wings and Deep Fried Tofu so good. At least on par with other Bubble Tea restaurants if not better. 

If you look on the screen, they will not only promote themselves and their daily specials but also other places such as Ippai Japanese Restaurant and some Massage Shop."}
{"text":"9$ for happy hour from 4-8:30 plus 2 drinks.

Sometimes the rooms I get are too cold though.

The karaoke systems are new and touch screen so that's nice."}
{"text":"This place looks better from the outside and it's definitely ratchet af on the inside. As asians do, we go ktv and I was not impressed. 

First, someone from our group had booked a room in advance for 10:30pm for about 20 people. When we got there, they had given our room to someone else and tried to jip us by saying we booked another room. Luckily our friend who booked it knew each room individually and started arguing with the front desk, who was completely unapologetic. After a few minutes, he told us to wait in the smaller room while they figure something out. We piled into the room and it was full before half our party had even arrived... how would we have survived? They finally moved us to another room, where the ventilation was BROKEN. I had to take off my shirt in 10 minutes because I was sweating from just sitting there.... is that normal?! NO. 

Also, the karaoke machines were laggy and weren't working properly, in either room? The guy had to fiddle with the back for 20 minutes until it started working. Food and drinks took forever to come as well.. I enjoyed the watermelon and that's all I'll say. 

Generally did not have a good time here, although the place was aesthetically pleasing. I don't think I'd come back here.. encore is better."}
{"text":"Love the unique decor of each room..

Don't like the late Happy Hour start time (4pm?) and the limited rooms..  if you don't book fast, there will be no more space.. (Which royally sucked).  

Also, if you don't have a yearly membership with them, you have to pay  $5 additional fee on top of the Happy Hour price..   

Song variety is good and also lots of English songs to choose from"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday and we were assigned a private room. From the outside, the place looks very modernized and spacious. Upon entering, there are a lot of lights everywhere and things look to be extremely decorative. When being led to the rooms, it starts looking a lot more plain and crappy.

With about 14 of us, the room felt really cramped, the service wasn't too bad though - they were quick to deliver food and drinks, they could've checked up on us more often though.

As for the karaoke part of it - the room wasn't that clean to begin with, the song choices were limited and the microphones weren't very clean and very worn.

2/5."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Ten23 couple years ago when I was still in highschool. Back then, the Happy Hour was $8 per person, but now it has gone up to $10, which is still quite reasonable as you get almost 5 hours of singing (4pm-8:30pm) and 2 non-alcoholic drinks of your choice. However, you're required to have a membership card to get the deal, or pay an extra $5 split among your group. 

There are other pricing structures for other timeslots, such as pay per hour or minimum food/alcohol purchases, but I generally find the Happy Hours are the best deal. 

They have renovated the rooms since I last been here, so the couches and chairs are still relatively new with no visible tears. We got a medium sized room for our group of 10 and it felt pretty spacious still. There were 2 TV screens facing different directions for us to look at for the lyrics. Apparently some of the bigger rooms even have their own private bathroom, which is definitely a huge plus. 

You can select your songs from the big touchscreen menu at the front. They use the same song selection system as many other Asian karaoke bars, which even though it contains a decent selection of recent English songs, the system is very bad at searching for a specific song that you want, despite you typing in the correct name word for word. 

Similar to many other karaoke bars, the food and drinks are very pricey and often don't come in very big portions. The free drinks that we got was decent, pretty much tasted like what you can get from a canned soda. There is a dine in restaurant area outside of the karaoke suits, but it's usually empty because the food just aren't very good, so I wouldn't recommend that you try it either."}
{"text":"First time here because we decided to search up karaoke and this was the closest in the area. 4 starts because they tried to make it look like we got a deal. They said for our party of 6 we would pay $120 for the room (Room 1) but since it was out first time they gave it for $100. Recently looked online, the same room we were in the fits a max of 7 plp is regular priced at $100.

Aside for the price, we had a lot of fun. The service was good, the food was good. I liked how they work where you pay for the room but that price is just the amount for the food you order and the karaoke is free. ( room was $100 so we ordered $100 worth of food and drinks which includes alcohol!) and if you have a song they don't have you can tell them and they will add it and next time it'll be there. 

There is also a membership for the year which is $10 or you can get the day pass for $5 but since we liked it we decided to get the $10 membership knowing we would comeback for sure"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years and while its competition has came and gone, this karaoke spot is still around. Why? They are always up to date with the latest songs! Every time I come here, they have new chart toppers from Asia and America. Only like oldies? Don't fret. There's lots of Chinese and English songs from before I was born as well :D  the place is pretty clean and modern and the prices for food and drinks are decent. Happy hour from 4-8:30 pm everyday and it's $13 pp which includes 2 non alcoholic drinks. Food is pretty tasty as well. Rooms are all private and varying in size. Overall a good choice for karaoke!"}
{"text":"Songs there are very up-dated. And there are songs in different languages. Happy- hour price is very affordable, only $10/person including 2 non-alcoholic drinks, from 4-8:30 pm. Mic is ok to use but of course not the best."}
{"text":"Terrible service.

Lost my friend's ID and when my friend called to ask them, one female employee was extremely rude about it. Made it sound like it was our fault that they misplaced her ID. 
You know who you are. 

Thank god there was one person who was nice enough to apologize. 

Food and drinks were average. Missed one of our order but nothing too bad. 

Never going back again and won't recommend to my friends because of 'you know who'."}
{"text":"Good song selection! Reasonable price! Service is ok compared to other Chinese karaoke place."}
{"text":"Decent staff and service for a Chinese operated karaoke spot. The \"Service button\" they have on the screen actually works - a staff will come within a minute or two. They also check up on you (which is pretty unusual) to follow up with any more drinks for snacks.

The place itself is surprising well maintained. It's not super worn down, and it does not smell funny. Washroom is clean enough to use. 

The machines they have are meh. It's touch screen and all that, but it doesn't work perfectly. What I disliked the most was their microphone. Terrible quality and faulty."}
{"text":"I been to TEN23 a couple of times for both K-lunch and happy hour K.

This is a good place for people that want to have a little gathering of Karaoke singing and some food to eat during lunch. You will be assigned to little private rooms that can fit the people according to your party. K-lunch cost $9.99+taxes+service charges. That includes a choice of entrees and a non alcohalic drink.  The time frame is from 12pm to 3 pm. So basically you can sing nonstop for 3 hours! 

The food is quite good. I have tried Grilled Pork Chop and eggs with rice, Spaghetti Bolognese, Japanese Seafood Ramen,  Minced Pork with Rice Taiwanese Style and Korean Style Ribs with rice.

For the free drinks, you can order cold drinks with no extra charges, that includes honey lemon drinks. The cold drinks are much better value because they are served in big glasses! (yes you will get thirsty when you are singing for 3 hours!)

The songs here are quite current and has Western, Mandarian, Cantonese songs too.

However, the services do need to improve because they don't really check on you that much in case if you need something extra. After the wait staffs took your order and serve your food.. they kind of disappeared.......

For Happy Hour is from 4 pm to 9pm for $8 that includes 2 non-alcohalic drinks. The menu during Happy Hour really sucks! All deep fried food and for $4.99 they are all really small..and their dumplings are nasty.. the frozen one that deep fried until they are dry! So have something to eat before coming to sing your heart out for 5 hours!

There is a membership fees of $15 for 1 year. or you can pay $5 per group each time you come.

Accepts all credit cards! 10% service charges are added automatically so make sure you don't double tip! 

Make sure call for reservation for happy hours couple of days ahead for weekends, they are quite busy and you might be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  Private rooms, lots of sake, alcohol and more alcohol...the food though, not good at all.  That's why I didn't give 5 stars.  So, drink and sing all you can, then have a designated driver or stagger to one of several restaurants near by."}
{"text":"Their wings are so good, simple naked wings, i went here a few times for happy hour and this place is one of the older karaokes in Toronto"}
{"text":"Too bad you cannot give a 0.

First, rooms are at a rate. You must spend at least their minimum, and on top of that, they charge a fee if you are not a member.

Room - Dark and small. We told them our party would be 10-12 people and they put us in a room for 6. Had to have it changed. The room smelled of smoke, and was dark to disguise the state. It was in disrepair from what I could tell.

Food - Really? Our group ordered a cross section of the menu, only one item was fresh and good, the fruit platter. Curry beef balls were frozen meatballs in a bland sauce. I think they were nuked. Onion rings, from frozen, drenched in oil. The french fries, mashed potatoes extruded into the form and fried. Calamari, disgusting and overcooked. Chicken wings, frozen and deep fried, no sources or flavour.

Equipment - The mikes were okay, not bad at all, and they did supply covers for them that were new. The system was less desirable. They operate the system using a tablet. Everything in Chinees. We had to have the server flip it for us, and every part needed to be flipped around. The system even froze during the night. There were two good flat screens in the room as well.

Songs - Very limited. Mostly rap and top 40 for only the last few years. There were older songs, but classics could not be found. We even tried to find classics and they did not appear. Basic artist like Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie and others could not be found. Playback was sometimes out of sync. I would say 10% of them suffered from such. The video was set to Low Definition, less than a standard definition TV, and more like a 320P display. It is not understandable, knowing todays technology, that such would be the standard for them.

Bar - Limited alcohol choices led to an unpleasant experience for me. I don't drink beer, so when I looked at their spirits nothing really stood out. They only stock white rum, and then shooters.

If it was not for the company we were with, my wife and I would not have stayed.

I would suggest to avoid this place until they get it together and update their song choices and offer a better cross section. 

As a side, my wife and I enjoy \"Bar Rescue\", this place needs to have them come in and fix it up. The food needs revamping and so does the selections.

Location wise, approach the venue from the East or turn North on Woodbine in order to not have to make a U turn.

Hope this helps you avoid a traggic night."}
{"text":"My go to karaoke, compared to a lot of other ones, it's very clean. However they should update their speakers not the best.  Out of all the other options, this is one of my top 3. I don't want to mention my experience with the ones downtown especially the ones in Chinatown 

Easy parking, right off the highway very commute friendly."}
