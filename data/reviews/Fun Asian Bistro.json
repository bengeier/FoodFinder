{"text":"This place just opened and it's got the best Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisine around. The sushi is super fresh and very reasonable lunch prices. The staff is very friendly and the interior is modern and sleek. Don't let the exterior fool you - Fun Asian is the best around. Don't pass it u"}
{"text":"Just moved to Pittsburgh couple months ago. I am a big fan of Asian food, so I started to look for good Asian restaurant since the first day. In Penn Hills, there are some choice for Chinese food, but no Japanese, until yesterday, I received the menu from Fun Asian Bistro. Apparently, they just open. And we are happily to find that they serve Chinese, Thai and Japanese. What a convenient stop. Then I decide to give it a try, which turns out is a right decision. My girlfriend and I order some sushi and hibachi. The fish is very fresh and the hibachi is so flavorful. And yes, the decor inside is very modern and comfortable, the service is amazing as well. Definitely would refer it to friends and be back!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. They have a very diverse menu and the food was fantastic. I had a sweet potato roll and orange chicken. I will definitely be back..."}
