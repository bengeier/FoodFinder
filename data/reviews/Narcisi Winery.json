{"text":"Excellent ... from start to finish  We ordered the hummus platter and portabella mushroom appetizers.  The platter is HUGE with plenty of pita for 4 people with regular, black bean, and spicy hummus and tabouleh.  It was so good we ordered it for takeout too.  The spring greens salad with pecans had a salad dressing that was worth dipping your bread in ... oh wait the dipping oil for the bread was double dip worthy.  The steak, steak salad, and seafood canoli (I know that is a dessert but it is a tube of lobster, crab, & shrimp with lots of cheese) were very good.  The staff from hostess to busboy to waitresses were all smiling like they really enjoy their job.  It is a winery and only serves wine (no beer or hard liquor).  We had the Niagara and Peach. Very good.  Lots of parking.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  Only disappointing part of the meal was the bread ... some crusty sourdough, French, or Italian would have made this a 5 star review.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Mother's Day brunch! Lots of carbs, but the menu was pretty decent and great set up! Bacon, sausage, chicken, pasta, potatoes, French toast sticks. The wine there isn't the greatest and they don't have a full service bar, so if you are looking for mimosas or a good Bloody Mary you won't find it here. You will find beautiful scenery, family friendly, great staff, decent food and a good time. Although it is a winery, their wine tastes like Welch's grape juice but you can enjoy the outside bar with select beers too. So overall, it was great and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and it is consistently delicious up and down the menu. The wine is quite good as well. Whether it's the bread, lobster bisque, pasta dishes, chicken mozzarella, or what-have-you, dishes are cooked to or near perfection. The look and feel of the restaurant is also well designed, offering a comforting and inviting ambiance in doors, and a relaxing atmosphere outdoors that even includes picnic tables. The prices are very, very reasonable. Actually, the quality of the food is such that they could probably charge more if they wanted. Overall, this restaurant is an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Really great place to relax all day long. There is ample room to hangout, drink great wine, and eat good food. The love music on the weekends is a great touch. I had their house Chardonnay which was delicious along with a few appetizers. The goat cheese dish was delicious. I would come here just to eat their fresh bread and dipping oil. It does get a bit crowded but once you are seated you feel no pressure to rush your stay. My group stayed for a long while and ordered multiple bottles and our server was delightful! Great weekend activity."}
{"text":"We are in love with this place. Come hungry because you will be stuffed after you leave. The wine prices are great. They let you try three samples before choosing one for dinner or lunch. We have not had one entrée on the menu that has disappointed us. Beautiful views not matter if you are inside or outside."}
{"text":"This winery has it all... amazing food and wine (peach wine is my favorite!!), romantic and beautiful scenery, reasonable prices, live entertainment, and a picnic area you can bring your family and friends to hangout.. I would recommend this winery to my friends and loved ones any day"}
{"text":"The wine is descent. The atmosphere is great. The food is overpriced and the service is terrible. I had to get up twice to go to the bar to order my own glass of wine because the server never came back. Also, when we're able to ask for more bread we were told that they might be out. It was 2:00 PM.    On top of that, their computer system was down for the entire time."}
{"text":"We visited with some friends on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon for lunch. Our group of 4 adults and 1 toddler was seated outside but in the shade (LO was much happier there). The setting is gorgeous. A lovely fountain punctuates the outdoor patio area. They've installed a new outdoor bar with a pizza oven. The grounds are beautiful with well manicured lawns, a small creek, outdoor stage, and outdoor picnic pavilion. It really is picturesque.  Our group ordered the heirloom tomatoes bruschetta (loaded with tomatoes, goat cheese, and balsamic) and the zucchini fries (shoestring strips of zucchini deep friend and served with marinara). The appetizers were delicious and arrived perfectly. Our server, Kevin, even scrounged up some fruit for the baby to eat for lunch time (melon, cantaloupe, and grapes) and it was GREATLY appreciated. The bread and dipping oil is fantastic. We even bought a bottle of the oil to take home!  The ceaser salad was good but nothing remarkable. The arrabbiata pasta with lobster and shrimp was wonderful. The lobster was perfectly cooked, not chewy or overdone at all and the sauce was just spicy enough that you noticed. Our friends enjoyed the pizza and the diavolo pasta and hubby loved the blackened scallops with Gorgonzola cream sauce. The food was lovely, enhanced by the beautiful setting!  The only downfall of lunch was the bel sogno wine. We should have tasted it before ordering a bottle but threw caution to the wind and regretted it for sure. This wine is SWEET. I can't say it enough it is sweet enough to give you a sour stomach. It would be fantastic over ice cream but not to drink for dinner. The Rosabella (white) was fantastic, not sweet, crisp, and perfect for sipping on a gorgeous afternoon.  Service was great. Kevin was friendly and prompt and went out of his way for our LO, which we really appreciated. I can't wait to return on another beautiful afternoon or evening!"}
{"text":"Great all around experience.  Definitely. Destination worthy of any trip in Pittsburgh area.  Service fine,  food consistently great."}
{"text":"I left a bad review on here about a year and a half ago for poor customer service. Glad to see it was taken down just like the one I left on Facebook."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and wine! We started off ordering two wine slushes, a black raspberry and a peach. I ordered the blackened scallop pasta and my fiancé ordered the seafood cannelloni. Our waitress brought us fresh bread and oil before our entrees arrived. The bread was warm and soft and the oil had the perfect seasonings! The wine slushes and the bread were a great start to this meal!  Our entrees did not disappoint! The blackened scallops were cooked to perfection! My fiancé's seafood cannelloni was delicious too! I have nothing bad to say about either of our meals!  I would definitely come back to eat at Narcisi any time! It is well deserving of each of the five stars and I would recommend visiting if you haven't had the chance to yet."}
{"text":"They offer good options in wine.  But did except  better quality food.  Spinach dip very runny, paste drowning in sauce with little flavor and color, etc."}
{"text":"I. Love. Narcisi. Winery. This place really is the hidden gem of Pittsburgh. The wine is amazing, the food is amazing, the service is amazing, the interior and exterior decoration is amazing. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Narcisi Winery. This is by far my favorite place to eat in all of Pittsburgh. I have even gone on the tour of the winery led by the owner and his wife. It was great to get a look at how they make the wine, how they store it, and to learn a bit about how you're actually supposed to taste wine. Being only 23 I'm a bit new to the scene, wine to me used to mean the cheapest bottle (or even box) of moscato I could find at the liquor store! Narcisi has opened my eyes to a whole new world of wine drinking. Not to mention, the food at La Vite restaurant is to die for. I have tried several things on the menu and everything has always been amazing. This is also my go to spot to bring out of town guests and I've never heard anything but praise from anyone I've brought here! If you haven't been here yet you are definitely missing out and should head over ASAP. It's especially fun in the summertime when you can sit outside in the shade, listen to live music, chat with friends and enjoy good food & good wine. All of the best things life has to offer! If you're going on a weekend night I would recommend having a reservation but we've never had any issues getting a table outside at lunch time."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. Love the outdoor patio area. Awesome, relaxing and rustic. Charming. The staff is always attentive and spot on. And the food always yummy. Tried a few things here. The flatbread is always delightful, light and crisp crust. Here on Saturday and had the salmon and rice with asparagus. The fish and all ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly. Always an enjoyable dining experience and you can't go wrong with a glass of wine to accompany your meal. Terrific!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  Beautiful environment and delicious wine for a very fair price. The food was delicious too. I have a gluten allergy and the gluten free pizza flat bread was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here about a dozen times and to be completely honest it has gotten worse each time.  The wait for food to arrive, even pizza, takes longer each time we go.  But let me review tonight's dinner service. We went with a large group on a Thursday at 4pm with kids in toe. We would have sat outside but it was raining, so we sat upstairs away from the dining area, that had hardly anyone in it anyways. It took them 20 minutes to seat us, even though there was no one there, 50 minutes to get pizza, and another 15-20 of waiting for a check. The kids in the group were getting tired of sitting, so we let them get up and move around since they are 5 and under. The manager then came up and reprimanded us in a rude way for the kids moving around too much since we were above the dining area.  We understand that dining out with kids can be tough which is why we choose the time and day to go.  The manger handled it poorly Over all just a bad experience"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here! It's one of my favorite wineries and they also have a delicious restaurant! Each time I visit, I can't wait to return again. They have a nice wine tasting section in the front where you can try four wines. They have a wonderful outdoor area where you can choose to eat and drink outside near the gorgeous fountain (and take some photos of course) or inside if you prefer some air conditioning in the heat of summer. They usually have local bands perform on weekends which can make it get extremely crowded, but you can always bring your own chairs to set up in the grass and I have even noticed people bring coolers and make an entire day of it! I love, love, love, each one of their wines and every bite of food I have taken so far. The bread and dipping sauce is insanely good and I always buy the sauce to take home! I also love the spinach and artichoke dip. The Niagara wine is one of my go to's. Can't wait to return more this summer!"}
