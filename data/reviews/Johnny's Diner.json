{"text":"The service was very rude and totally ignored us. Pips was much better."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to try the food. Lady who was cooking was extremely moody and said to a customer I always have to deal with the assholes. After we walked in and sat down and basically said or did anything to receive a comment like that. So fuck that little old lady and fuck johnnys diner."}
{"text":"A prefect little diner with huge food helpings! Very polite staff and quick service! I loved it ( wish I hadn't forgotten my grits on the table! )"}
{"text":"Very good for breakfast.  Small restaurant run by a family that obviously care about the quality of the food they serve."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time,  been wanting to try this place for awhile,  and glad I did,  it's very small,  but very busy and well known place. It's clean inside and everyone is friendly and works well together,  they all work hard.  The servers at the counter also does all the cooking and they keep up well.  They work hard,  I will be returning for sure,  their sausage is very good from a local place called Richie's in Kennedy all their stuff is from local businesses,  I love how they support small local businesses,  being in the restaurant business I understand!!!! Keep up the great work you all deserve the business"}
{"text":"Wow, what a GREAT old school  REAL diner, sit at the counter & watch your server cook your food right in front of you. I cook for a living & work in a diner, but what these girls do with 1/2 the equipment & space, plus serve you is out of my leauge. The food was just as amazinh as the show  locally sourced meats ftom richeys?? in kennedy twp & a place on notth side i didn't catch the name of, best sausage i've ever had outside of homade, eggs homefries & toast all made with BUTTER, if you've never been, go check this place out, it's more than worth it"}
{"text":"After my GPS took me in circles a few times, I finally made it to Pip's - except now it's Johnny's.  I understand not much has changed.  The other patrons were mostly regulars.  The amount of butter used is heart stopping.  And the breakfast was top-notch.  It's a tiny little place, though, so I wouldn't recommend going on a weekend unless absolutely necessary.  As it was, my friend and I got the last table when we showed up around 9am on a random weekday.    I can't remember what my breakfast was officially called on the menu, but it included eggs, bacon, home fries, toast and pancakes.  Those who know me know my love for bacon, but here at Johnny's the pancakes were my favorite part of the meal.  Those pancakes were outstanding, and probably enough to get me to return eventually at which time I will sit at the counter and enjoy watching my breakfast being made.  I think a good show will only add to my rating in the future."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic dinner experience, you simply must visit Johnny's Diner.  I do miss certain things about Pip's, however many of the same employees work here that used to work at Pip's.  Gone is the \"Table of Knowledge\" plaque, but the community table is still there.   Gone are some of the quirky Eastern European foods, such as Pierogi, but the traditional diner/breakfast foods are still there.  I like that I can order grits, that's fairly unique for Pittsburgh.  I love the smile and conversation that comes with the really good down home food.  Hash brown potatoes are excellent.  Marvelous toast.  Great food!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick, delicious, greasy spoon type breakfast/lunch. My daughter loves their silver dollar pancakes. Don't be fooled by the name though, they are the size of an adult hand! My uncle loves the biscuits and sausage gravy. It's homemade and not too salty at all! The waffles are good and my husband is not a breakfast fan, but always gets their homemade burgers."}
{"text":"Incredible food. The french toast is amazing but lets not take the light off the other food as well. Came to Pittsburgh to experience the city and definitely feel you need to eat here for the best Pittsburgh experience. Will definitely be stopping here every time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"I laughed out loud when I got a look at this place. It was so small and homely! But the reviews were good so my son and I gave it a try and we are glad we did. The food was plentiful, it tasted wonderful, and the prices were low. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Johnny's is your favorite neighborhood diner. If you live on Mt. Washington, it's a hop skip and jump down the hill. There are a lot of diners to choose from nearby (Micro Diner, J & J, Hanlon's, etc.) but the service and food at Johnny's is exceptional. I really appreciated the hustle that the waitresses/cooks put forth. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the food being made and your bacon sizzle!  I got a western omelette with home fries and toast. I left there feeling full for days! Great diner coffee and great diner vibes!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I will be coming back before I head back home to Florida."}
{"text":"Get here!  Last night on our way home from a wedding, a small group of us made plans to eat at Johnny's the following morning. After dragging ourselves out of bed, we made our way to Johnny's, a whole 3 minute drive from the mount.  We showed up around 915 and the place was packed. We waited by the door for about 10 minutes until 5(!!) bar spots opened up. As soon as we sat down, one of the waitresses cleaned our spot and took our drink orders. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on Italian bread with bacon and all the fixins (lettuce, tomato, and mayo). The bread was perfectly toasted, the bacon was crispy, and most importantly, the cheese was perfectly melted over the eggs. My fianc√© ordered Johnny's big breakfast. For $8 he got 2 eggs, 2 sausage links (delish), home fries, 2 pieces of toast, AND 2 large fluffy pancakes. You don't have to wonder if I tried everything he ordered, because you know I did! I mean, how was I supposed to review it?!   The waitresses were very friendly and were even encouraging every to finish their plates. It was reminiscent of eating at your friends grandma's house.  Overall, it's definitely worth the short drive and the wait. The icing on the cake was that we didn't even have that diner smell when we went home. Why 4 stars? The home fries needed to be a bit more crispy, but that's just my opinion :)"}
{"text":"Ok there is one word that I can use to sum up this place AUTHENTIC...  If there is a master class on what the sole of a diner is this place would be the master study. A diner should make you feel comfortable the food should be delicious and plentiful and the price should be reasonable. The servers should take good care of you but at the same time you know a fiesty \"kiss my grits Mel\" might come out. This place is small. the front facade says child of the 60's you go in and the main galley is curved giving it the quintessential dining car feel the customer sitting at the counter with a porcelain subway tile wall behind and the cook working on the other side of the counter on a stainless steel diner line. It's the original style diner not the 50's chromed jukebox diner the 30's porcelain railcar working class diner and the food? well.... have you ever gotten a breakfast and the sausage patty is a perfectly round puck you know the same as you buy frozen in a pack from the grocery store. well that's unflavorful and boring but this diner gives you a large hand made patty you know an AUTHENTIC sausage patty. The French toast is sour dough the slab beacon the home fries are not all perfectly cubed chunks of potato they have abnormal shapes. AUTHENTIC. The coffee is good and the cup is bottomless. AUTHENTIC. it's a diner that time forgot in a corner of Pittsburgh that time forgot give it a try and trust me you will love the place. And like me planning on going back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Note #1: CASH ONLY. An ATM can be found inside.   Note: #2: This used to be Pip's Diner and changed hands in 2010.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/pips-diner-pittsburgh?hrid=BIFCI4_ttRi7QaPe_1Ahpw#src:self  Johnny's is as close to the archetypal American diner as you'll get in Pittsburgh. It's claustrophobic, only breakfast and lunch are served, a long counter acts as a centerpiece, lottery tickets are sold, and flanneled, burly, unshaven men are its primary customers.   The bill of fare is simple and mostly consists of eggs, home fries, omelets, french toast, burgers, and other sandwiches. One can't get Eggs Benedict or have Simosas with brunch here.  Hell, you might receive cross-eyed looks for even mentioning the word \"brunch\" to your server.   Therein lies Johnny's appeal.   Johnny's Steak, Egg, & Cheese Breakfast Sandwich can be had on white bread or a bagel, and contains meat that is as dainty, succulent, saliferous, and flavorsome as the best corned beef. Nothing about this steak conjured images of old shoes being pulled out of boiling pots of water. The lettuce and tomato were garden fresh, the white bread was cottony yet sturdy, and the bright yellow American Cheese deliquesced onto the meat elegantly, no doubt while underneath a cover on the flattop grill.   Also devoured were a trio of paradisiacal pancakes that were fluffier than a Maine Coon Cat and as golden as the dawn. Butter and syrup were close to superfluous; the sign of transcendent flapjacks.   Kay's Raisin Bread French Toast was a touch overdone as was her strip of bacon. Redemption came in her grits, which just needed some butter, sugar, and salt to become the slice of Southern, maize-derived heaven that they were.   Don't allow the rough, trailer park exterior and rusty, underpass locale discourage you from making a stop at Johnny's."}
{"text":"Fair at best.  Service is always slow. I don't think it's because it's understaffed as much as it is the lack of effort on several employees. The cook is also the waitress and also busses dishes. She did not look to happy , it was like she hated being there. Today they ran out of clean silverware.  It took over 5 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and 22 minutes for a simple breakfast, no apologies. The other waitress spent the majority of her time chatting instead of checking on customers. Food is average, nothing spectacular or outstanding.  Atmosphere is mixed . It is old fashion, but a dive ( greasy smell, uneven heat, blasts of cold air ).  I live nearby so it's convenient , but I think I'll stay with Marges or Hanlons, that are a bit father to travel, but worth the time. Good food served fast and always with a smile.    I would not recommend this place if you are hungry or in a hurry. I would rate it 1 1/2 stars based on the service.i"}
{"text":"Very cool place that I never knew existed. There isn't a whole lot around it, but it's just over the very big hill from my house.  This place is the quintessential diner. It's perfect if you aren't a fancy pants. It's got super low ceilings, narrow spaces, breakfast being cooked right behind the counter, and a staff that just ties the whole experience together.  When we visited, my fianc√© had to wait for his breakfast sausage because one of the chefs \"stole\" the other's sausage right off the grill! This turned into a HILARIOUS \"fight\" that half the diner was involved in. It made my day.  The portions are very generous for the price, and you can tell they use quality ingredients.   If you are looking for a delicious, no-frills breakfast, this is the place. Don't let the exterior or the area steer you away. This place is legit and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Piece of advice: don't sit in the back corner if it's cold outside. I don't think any heat reaches that table. So after we moved, we decided to sit at the counter. It's impressive how the ladies take your order, turn around and cook it, then serve you. It's not a big diner by any means, but their efficiency was still impressive. We watched them make our eggs and toast, and while no one likes to see the amount of butter that actually goes into the food, it was still cool to watch. My ham and cheese omelet was full of cheese and pretty good, and my wife's poached eggs were done perfectly. We would go back if in the mood for a true greasy spoon diner experience."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. Best breakfast in the burgh. Still very much a hidden gem. The usual breakfast and lunch fare along with daily specials.The price and service are good. The omelette is the best thing in my opinion. Along with the home fries and mancinni's toast. Helps to get rid of any hangover. I bring my kids and they love the family atmosphere. Give it a try!"}
