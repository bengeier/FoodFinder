{"text":"Sorry, there is no option for me to offer it a 1/2 star or else I would have, and here's why: The owner cuts back on portions, for $7 plus tax, you at least expect to get a full box. I showed the owner/server how he had cut back by comparing 2 boxes he had fixed for the customers standing in line ahead of me. He just gave me an unapologetic look. I ordered the Mangolian chicken, there was more oil and less chicken on my plate. To add to this misery, on taking a closer look, I notice a strand of hair. This place is still surviving because of its location, it's right next to the Spectrum center and is located inside a busy bus stop, but if you have an option, please do yourself a favor and walk away. There are several other Chinese eat out spots just a few blocks away, or else good luck tasting human hair!!"}
{"text":"The best Sesame chicken I have had in Unite State . I like their bourbon chicken as well. It's convenience to have Chinese food in uptown."}
{"text":"I ordered carryout from this place because I happened to be at the bus station around lunch time. When I got back to my office, I opened the box to find hairs woven into the food.   I called China Shuttle and explained the situation. I told them I was too far away to walk all the way back with the hairy food. The person on the phone told me to bring in pictures of the food, and they would take care of me. I thought the demand for photo evidence was a little strange, but fine, I was willing to play along. I took out my phone and took some high resolution photos of the hairy food.  I went back today and showed the photos to a man of Asian decent who I believe to be the manager. At first he claimed he couldn't see any hairs, so I increased the brightness on the phone. Then he said, and I quote, \"Those look like they might be eyebrow hairs.\" I said I was uncertain what part of the body said hairs originated from but that I didn't believe it was relevant. At which point he told me there was nothing he could do for me.   So he refused to give me a replacement lunch, or a refund, after viewing the photographic evidence. If they are willing to go to such lengths to save a couple bucks, I have no doubt they are cutting corners where sanitation is concerned.   Avoid hair, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Today's special is General Tso\"s chicken but they do not have any.....I asked them to prepare it, was told no that the cook decides not to make it, and I could not speak with the manager.  My opinion, do not put it on your special board if you do not have it!!! Service sucks here.!!!"}
{"text":"A great Chinese family owned restaurant for those who are in the mood for a quick bite around Uptown. Pro tip: if you are in the mood in venturing out into something a bit more authentic, try the Sichuan Dandan noodles! The owner (who is originally from Chengdu) always hooks me up with the classic Sichuan dishes at lunchtime and they are delicious!. My friend ordered some stir fried long bean with black bean sauce and short rib noodles, another Sichuan classic!"}
{"text":"Lower end of the mall food court chinese place hierarchy. General Tso chicken is the daily special, but, they have none. Sesame chicken has no sesame seeds.  Just chicken in brown sauce. Bourbon chicken is flavorless."}
{"text":"Rude unpleasant... nobody want to be treated like crap and spend money I only ate here because my son was hungry seasame chicken taste like pure sugar no flavor... they rush you to order never again.. my rating should be a negative"}
{"text":"We were headed to a concert at Time Warner Cable Arena and didn't want to chance moving the car because we had such a good parking spot. So we walked over to the local transit terminal to grab a quick bite at China Shuttle. I had a spring roll and shrimp egg roll. Everything came out quickly. There was plenty of seating. The decor was minimal. The cashier had lots of personality, which was pretty entertaining. Overall, China Shuttle cured my hunger pangs."}
{"text":"I came during lunch time, so I assumed the food would be at its best. It tasted like it had been reheated from several days ago. I've had better asian food from the freezer aisle of Walmart. Bland, mushy, and totally gross."}
{"text":"First and last time eating here....you know that moment you have when you regret choosing eating at place for the first time well that's what I've just had....the food is sub par and flavorless...it's set up cafeteria style so you can choose your own dishes I had the Sesame Chicken...which they purport to be the best in town(their words not mine) and teriyaki chicken with a side of their lo mien....huge misses on all points. The only reason they are in business is because they are located in the transit station uptown. Avoid at all costs."}
