{"text":"If you're not watching the game, your money is better spent elswhere."}
{"text":"bartenders are great but the kitchen needs work. the cooks can't seem to cook French fries. even when ordered well done or extra crispy they come out limp and half raw inside."}
{"text":"The most thoughtless service I have ever received. We were seated and ignored for 40 minutes while three tables around us that came in after us ordered and were served. The food is sub par and the service is astonishingly poor. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Always incredibly inconsistent with their hours and kitchen. They seem to close both the bar and kitchen early quite often, with no notice. Sunday I was given a menu at 9:55, and then was told three minutes later that the kitchen was closed. The bartenders said it was not their decision, leading me to believe either management, or ownership, doesn't care about consistency or their customers. This has happened often enough that I will never return, even though I like the patio. Service is mediocre, food not very good and because I never know when they might randomly close early, there is nothing to make me want to ever give them another penny of my money."}
{"text":"Would have been great but they let people smoke right outside the restaurant door. Stunk up the whole side of the restaurant. When we complained to the waitress she said \"we try but no one listens. Sorry.\"  So, if you don't mind the smell of smoke while you eat then come here!  If you mind smoke, move on!"}
{"text":"Service is good, beers on tap are okay, food is really pretty awful. I like the idea of the nice outdoor patio on Coventry but beyond that there is no reason to go here!"}
{"text":"Well, it's bar food, so don't expect Tiramisu after you have your seafood bisque. FWIW, this mirrors the other Panini's locations so you don't have to schlep yourself downtown anymore. French fries in the sandwiches plus a full assortment of brews equals college grade decadence. I tend to frequent here when Tommy's across the street is closed or has a two hour wait."}
{"text":"Beer, food, service, atmosphere: generic, generic, generic, generic.  Nothing about Panini's is bad... but nothing's really all that great either. The only saving grace is the patio on a nice summer's day.   Also, Pistol's right... Post 9 pm it's a total post-undergrad skeeve-fest."}
{"text":"Stick to the Chicken Wings & the Overstuffed Sandwiches. Aside from that, there is a lot of mediocrity. This is what you expect at a chain sports bar. They do have a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Panini's has a couple things going for it:  - The turkey panini is really delicious. It's basically all I eat there. There is also a turkey BLT wrap that is alright.  - The patio is a bit too sunny in the summer, but still pleasant. They used to have $2 Bloody Marys on Sunday, but that is no more. Too bad.  If you're the kind of person who doesn't like having a TV flickering away over the shoulder of your friend who you are trying to talk to, then this isn't the bar for you - no vertical surface has been left unadorned with some kind of projection.   But if you want to watch a sporting event with a bunch of other people, then this is a nice option. Definitely a huge step up from Winking Lizard across the street."}
{"text":"Since the last review I wrote on this location, they have changed ownership. The new owners are trying, but it is only worth going under these conditions...Go during lunch. That way the limited staff they have will serve you. I have tried to go in the evening after work (being 9pmish) maybe to get some wings or have a beer and watch sports for an hour but within the last month or so, the music has been SO LOUD that I have walked in and turned around and walked out. When I say loud music, it is so loud I could hear it from the parking garage but I assumed it was coming from a live band outside or something. Nope. It is inside Panini's and it is ear busting. So loud one could not have a conversation with yelling-loud. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and it was the worst service I've probably ever seen.  Nachos were cold, and took 50 minutes to receive.  One rough looking waitress had the nerve to say the crowd was the worst ever! We ordered wings, chicken tenders,  and bacon cheese fries, all of which never showed up after over an hour. Needless to say we promptly paid and left. Manager was no help at all getting food orders out. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Rude lady on phone Lindsy ( something like that ) rush me and said didn't have time to tell me a certain sauce because I had wrong name , placed me on hold while in middle of me talking . Told me either hold on because she was busy or call back after relooking at menu . Relooked at menu and was same name I was saying . The house wings which were what they used to call them now its brick house blend. Rude lady all it took was a min and I called back and was placed on hold again never got through. Called back placed order and picked up . Come home to eat wings were not done wings after I got through a few wings the skin was slimy and gooey like they were back and sauce was watered down . Called back and express that I wanted to speak to managers once again same girl said he's busy and can I help you. ( how do you speak for an manager smh ) once I spoke to manager IAN excuses came once I explain my service to just order. Oh it's been busy and sorry about the wings I had to tell him I want them redone and I'll come another day , he said ok and that's it I'm like to I speak to someone specific oh I'm closing I'll be here .  Never experience this at this location but this was horrible . Busy or not especially busy thats when you make sure you put on best customer service"}
{"text":"Bland food that's over priced. The drinks taste watered down and the beer selection reminds me of a frat party. Might only be good if you're looking to watch a game and don't own a tv or have the knowledge to buy a 12 pack at the store."}
{"text":"We had the Big Al and Buffalo Chicken Crunch wrap. Both were delicious. Service was great."}
{"text":"Extremely rude! The waitress served me a beer sample and took our drink order's then checked my ID a few minutes after. She then came back a few minutes later to check them again because when she asked the first time she skimmed them and walked away. The second time she took mine and my boyfriend's and accused mine of being fake and for some reason still held on to his. \"Ya, this is fake\" super thick, super bitchy. I told her I would get my passport and she said no and she would get the manager. Instead she ran around the bar with all the other waitresses showing them our IDs while all the other customers stared at us because she had been so loud they now all thought we had fakes and were waiting for drama. After a crazy long wait the manager comes back and says \"I don't know, they're really close\". REALLY CLOSE TO REAL? MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE. They ended up saying they would serve us drinks but at that point I was bitter so I said I wanted nothing. The waitress then tried to tell us to leave since I wasn't ordering anything to which I pointed out my boyfriend who she didn't even give the chance to order. He got his food and it was clearly disgusting. They never served him his drink. The little blonde waitress practically ignored us the whole time making it impossible to eat and get the hell out of the shitty place. She acted smug the whole time probably feeling like she won something since I wasn't drinking. Oh and during this whole thing two practically prepubescent looking boys came in an ordered drinks from her. She didn't ask for IDs, they had to shove them in her face, and I don't know why the hell she didn't question theirs. I understand the need for valid ID but they were wrong and horribly rude about the entire thing. They never apologized and made it a loud scene so it became a show for the entire joint."}
{"text":"Guess they start their late night menu before 12am now and its only pizza and sandwiches. Also they told us its a late night menu but never told us they didn't have pizza until we tried to order. Besides that the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this Panini's location!  The drinks are always cold....and they food is always hot!  We enjoy the atmosphere inside and out!  Keep up the good work.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place zero stars if I could. We came for a Buckeye game and had awful service, only two TVs outside carrying the game, and we listened to the juke box the entire night. I would recommend going anywhere but this place for a game."}
{"text":"Well me and my coworkers have been coming here for the past 7 years now , this month and last the service has gone down hill, let's start off by saying no refills  and the food took forever to come to are table."}
{"text":"I finally came here after living so close for so long. It was ok. I didn't eat, so I can't say anything about the food, but the service was acceptable and the patio was pretty nice (now that we have a little bit of a spring going on here in Cleveland). I might go back just to mix up my normal bar routine, especially in the summer when all I want to do is be outside with a cold beer."}
{"text":"This review is not suppose to suggest that the food is bad by any means. Panini's has good food for everyone and they will make arrangements to suite your needs. I went there on a friday evening dinner with friends and it was as loud as it can get. It was very loud. Everyone of us had ordered something different and everyone liked the food. It has a good bar environment, some young students. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a noisy bar to have some beers with friends but dont expect an extraordinary place."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a casual dinner and absolutely loved it! Neither one of us are big sports bar fans, but we wanted to do something out of our comfort zone and we're so glad we did! We will definitely be enjoying this Cleveland chain more often.  When arriving, we were advised we could seat ourselves, so we chose a nice little booth. Looking around on the 15 or so screens, I was thrilled to see the National Finals for Ice Skating! It seems sports bars never have that kind of thing on when I go to them unless it's the Winter Olympics, so it was nice to get to watch my favorite sport while out at dinner for once!   Our server, Joe greeted us quickly and was fantastic! He checked on us several times during our brief stay of about an hour. While we were waiting for food one of the managers, Evan, came by and chatted with us for a few minutes about the Monsters team and let us know he was available if we needed him. It was so refreshing to see a Manager at a sports bar take such genuine interest in conversing and connecting with all of the customers there.   The food was the standard sports bar fare, but the drinks were awesome! If you want something sweet, I highly recommend the Animal Cracker Martini (who says you have to grow up?) or the Italian Wedding Cake Martini."}
{"text":"They have the best French fries in the bar food business. I once ordered them and then ran off to talk to someone else in the bar and almost cried when I realized my fries had been left unattended for 45 minutes. Best fries ever."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about how great this place is but I was not impressed by either times I visited. I went and sat down for lunch one time with a friend and the service was horrible. The server was not nice and was slow (we were basically teh only people there). The food was medicore and the atmosphere was filled with tvs. The second time I tried here was when I ordered take out. Again the food was not impressive and not worth the price. I guess time my friends drag me here to visit I'll stick with drinking rather than eating."}
{"text":"Typical Panini's...nice outdoor patio, okay food, spotty service.  This bar attracts a younger crowd (mid 20 somethings) especially during Football season.  There was a slew of OSU fans.  Unless you want to relive your college years on a Saturday afternoon/evening, pick another bar!  Cornhole on the back deck."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location a few times but it doesn't seem to disappoint. The staff is very attentive and the food is always hot and right."}
{"text":"Panini's offers pretty tasty food and a sports bar like atmosphere. There are some 6 plasma televisions surrounding the bar island, which has a good selection of alcohol. The place definitely doesn't feel original and is a little sterile for a cozy bar/tavern type of feel, but they will have your typical bar food. Be aware that they do not have desserts."}
{"text":"Panini's on Coventry, since the moved here about 10 years ago, has always had the worst, snooty service of any average blue collar chain I've ever been to. Good location though. I imagine that's the only thing keeping them going."}
{"text":"I came here for an interview this afternoon and didn't eat.  We had two drinks a piece. The drinks were perfect not to strong or weak. The service was ok, although there weren't that many tables she was the only server, so I DEFINITLEY take that into account. The place is nice inside a little small but nice, very clean. Next time I'll try the food."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Here on an OSU Saturday and the service has been atrocious. There's literally 4 people at the bar and they threw a fit about turning the tv onto the OSU game. Everyone here seems to be in a terrible mood. The layout is ok, and we didn't order any food so I can't speak to that but this is a place I will never return. Go up the street to Tav Co if you want a good experience."}
{"text":"Run o'mill Panini's. No special drinks or food. Trivia on Tuesdays and Sundays!"}
{"text":"I know Panini's is a chain, but the folks here do their best to make this a good, homey experience. The place is nice, the food standard and tasty and the staff thoughtful. Parking is by a local garage located right next door, and they have a full bar, beer and wine and are just a nice place to stop after a long day at work, or a day of shopping on Coventry searching out the treasures in the various shops there.   So, stop by, hang out and relax a bit. Panini's will have you covered:)"}
{"text":"Well, I can't speak too highly of Panini's...  When I went with some colleagues, I found that the food was fair, and the beers standard.  Service was reasonably brisk.  The decor was very middle of the road, with standard bar accouterments, TVs, blonde wood...  Very generic.  If it weren't for the location, I can't imagine it surviving amidst a plethora of more distinct options.  If you're in the neighbourhood, and need a beer, knock yourself out.  If you're not, don't take the time to drive, for there is certainly something at least as good much nearer to you."}
{"text":"Wow. What a dump. Terrible. Hardly a panini on the menu. Awful readability on that thing too. Terribly long wait: didn't have a drink in my hand (water or beer) until 27min after being seated. and THEN after going outside to purchase my own order at the bar, the waitress brought us two beers we didnt even order. On top of it all, charged us for them still. Burger was soggy. Fries were soggy. (obviously left under a dish cover for an eternity). Fuckin joke. Awful."}
{"text":"We drove from on fleet ave to find this place went to a late night pizza and sandwich menu only.  I was pissed.  Now i have to drive all the way out mayfield to another paninis.  Sucks."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar that caters to the college and graduate student crowd.  Does anything more really need to be said about it?  For some people, this may be the best bar ever.  Me?  I'm looking for something a bit more original when I can go out.  I can yell, watch sports, and drink beer at home.  Okay, I don't own a TV, nor do I have any beer in my fridge, but I can still yell!"}
{"text":"Over the summer I was 17.5 miles into my run, stopped into PAnini's to refill my water bottle and nearly passed out (well that's what I get for testing the limits of how often I need to refuel on a long run). They gave me fruit cup and homemade gatorade. Once I could see again I stuck around for some tortilla soup. Delicious! And I think I have a new place for watching Bills games."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and overall, my experiences have been positive. Panini's is a great outdoor spot to enjoy some sun and grab some cheap eats. Definitely keep your expectations low in terms of the quality of the food. All of it is edible, but it just isn't amazing.  The last time I came here, it was on a weekday during their happy hour. I had a drink from the happy hour menu that was essentially sugar water and alcohol; didn't taste like there was much actual juice in there; just some kind of mediocre juice cocktail mixed in with bottom shelf liquor. It was a large drink, but was honestly pretty weak in terms of alcohol content; I like to taste the booze in my drinks, and this was pretty clearly watered down.  Next, looking to the happy hour menu, I was disappointed that there was nothing vegetarian that was on discount, so I settled for a full-price pizza. I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. The crust didn't have much crunch, and the pizza itself was pretty bland.   Unfortunately, to top things off, multiple people have been smoking on the patio every single time I've been here, and it really ruins the experience.  On a more positive note, the service staff is lovely and accommodating here.  I'll probably be back when I get bored of the better places, but I imagine I'll be back once and then want to leave this place alone for good."}
{"text":"Completely mediocre food and drinks, decent beer selection. Kind of a bro-ey crowd on weekends/nights, not much of a crowd during the day. It's a great place to go if there is a big game on and want a sport bar atmosphere.  In the summer the patio is great and they've got corn hole.  Upside it's open late and if you are looking for some drunk munchies on Coventry it's a good place to try."}
{"text":"went back to panini's recently after a multi-year hiatus due to moving out of state.  i was never that wild about it, unless it was 2:00 a.m., i was wasted, and had a hankering to get some eggs.  i have to say, though, the panini sandwich has saved my life.  if you've never had it, imagine a big sandwich - turkey, ham, corned beef, egg, whatever - with a side of coleslaw and french fries ALL ON THE SANDWICH.  it sounds nasty, but it's pretty damn good after 12 or 14 beers and has, on occasion, been the only thing that could stop the world from spinning.  not a spot i ever really just hung out in all night, but, when it came to coventry, was a nice alternative to the lizard."}
{"text":"I went during a non rush time. Half the restaurant was empty. It took me five minutes to be acknowledged- a waitress said she d be with me in a moment, then she said someone would be with me in a couple of minutes. I waited six more minutes and wound up leaving having not even been offered a glass of water. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was horrible. I was in the night before thanksgiving, visiting from New York. Got in around 11:45pm and the server promptly suggested we order before 12am as it would turn into the \"late night menu\". After rushing us through our order and selling my friends on the $3 \"long island ice teas\" aka just tea, she disappeared for 20 min. Our food was at the table before the drinks which was unacceptable. Once she brought our food and finally our drinks she asked us how we wanted the check to be split. We kindly informed her that we weren't ready to think about this since we had just gotten our food. She disappeared again without giving us utensils and without taking our drink order for our second round. When she finally came back she took our drink order and asked us if we were ready for the check, really trying to push us out. We offered to sit at the bar if she wanted to leave but she just continued to press us for the check. When she finally did bring the check she had no idea how to split a bill 3 ways with two cards and cash which is insane since I'm 1,000% sure micros will do it for you. Overall horrible experience. One of the reasons I would never live in Cleveland. I've gotten better service from hole in the wall bars in Williamsburg."}
{"text":"Bar manager refused to turn volume up for the Ohio State vs Michigan game because \"we're at capacity and then it becomes too loud.\" Hey buddy, it's a sports bar, that's why we're here.   They also have closed captioning on every TV which blocks 1/4 of the screen and game play. When asked to turn off CC, the bar manager said \"do you know how hard that is?\" Yes I do. It's one button on the remote.   There's a reason this place has 2 1/2 stars on Yelp: terrible customer service and poor management."}
{"text":"Happy hour pricing rules! I like to come here and grab drinks and food before seeing shows at the Grog Shop. That is pretty much the only thing that is cool about this place.  Went there Sunday night and all my friends ordered something to eat. 3 of them got there food pretty quick but the sundae took forever to come out. Everyone was pretty much done eating by the time she got a sundae. It wasn't a fancy sundae, it was like one that your mom would make. How does a simple sundae take that long. I went there last night...just one big waiting game. It wasn't busy. He kept forgetting to bring us our drinks and what we ordered. We were there for only a hour, and had 2 drinks. I should have consumed 4..but I couldn't get him to do his job. I could see if they were busy but there was only a few people sitting in there bar. Asked for the check...15 minutes later walked by and was like \"crap forgot the check\" HAHAHAHA.  Come for the happy hours pricing but you won't get the best service. Typical chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Panini is a knock-off Primanti sports bar.  The beer selection is good, the sports bar aspects (TV's) is good, but the food is mediocre.  Primanti isn't very good. Panini is just as bad. I was hoping they'd have improved the quality of ingredients or done something to make the sandwiches better."}
{"text":"came here after hours to get a steak egg and cheese sandwich and an extra side of garlic bread.  the girl behind the bar was rude and tried to \"correct\" me when she responded, so you want the panini?...she was too busy cleaning up and talking to other patrons to finish up with me.  some guy took my order and when i questioned my charge because it seemed less expensive, they said it was right.  once i get my food, my sandwich was good, but all they did with the garlic bread was toast a few pieces and dashed some garlic on it.  not at all what i wanted or expected and when i tried to go back to get them to fix it, they were closed.  not happy at all."}
{"text":"Came here after the parade starving and ready to eat. Ordered our food and was told after the fact was told we can only order off the late night menu. I haven't eaten all day and all I wanted was actual food. Now I'm forced to leave here and go somewhere else. Ridiculous .  It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"During the warmer weather this is the place my boyfriend and I frequent for happy hour because of the outdoor bar/patio. The service is always very good and the beer and food is reasonably priced even when it isn't happy hour. The food is always great. Never been disappointed on that front. Especially with the boneless wings. My favorite is the garlic butter and the basic buffalo. The servers actually remember what you've ordered to drink and if you have a specification for food you always get it with no hassle. The patio is really nice and clean. Definitely my favorite place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Service is really really REALLY hit or miss. The menu is extensive for bar food. The outdoor patio and TV's redeem the place a bit. A tad disorganized management wise. I've been here lots. Lots of tv's throughout. Get used to rap and hip hop blaring, otherwise this is not your place. Mostly you can seat yourself as there is rarely a wait. I like the pizza and wings. Sandwiches are good too though I once had to send back spoiled cole slaw. They have a good happy hour special and a huge variety of brews to choose from. Park in the adjacent structure or on the street. 25 cents 24 hours a day. Quarters only. 35 for dinner for two is par."}
{"text":"A go to spot to watch sports as there are SEVERAL large TVs here. Servers are attentive but sometimes the crowd is hit or miss here, especially at the bar on the patio. Lots of drink choices and a big menu make Paninis a great place for a group or hungry diner!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't really argue with any of details of the negative reviews here.  This is a meat market in the evening.  It's a generic sports bar.   But did any of these people have a sandwich here?  Seriously - Fries + coleslaw + fried whatever (turkey, roast beef, egg, etc) = one good sandwich.  I love mixed up food and I love Panini's sandwiches.  Ignore the crowd, sneak up to an empty spot at the bar and order a sandwich.  You won't regret it.    BTW - if anyone knows a place that puts fries and slaw on a sandwich in Seattle, please let me know.  I miss these sandwiches."}
{"text":"Panini's has been on my top five local dining spots since moving to the Cleveland area. No matter where I've lived around the city I seem to find myself coming back time and time again. Some of my favorites are the Fish Sandwich and Philly Cheesesteak but you have to try their signature Panini sandwich. Yums!!  The funnel cake fries are bomb. You have to appreciate fair food when not at a fair.   This location has always been a hangout spot for my husband and I since moving to Cleveland Heights. Whether you're here to kickback and watch a game on the patio or passing by on the late night to get pizza you'll find the prices reasonable and the food delicious.    I have given 4 stars because, well, there's always room for improvement.  We are here now in a semi empty bar and our water hasn't come back with the water we asked for more than 5 minutes ago. This place isn't that large and the bar is really close by us. Eh...what can you do?"}
{"text":"I really try to give those in customer service positions the benefit of a doubt. But the bar staff I encountered on 5/31/16 was just so...hmmm. Thats the best way I can describe the manner of of service we received."}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple weeks ago late one Saturday night with a group of friends and it just wasn't the best of experiences.   Definitely a younger loud crowd, I'm guessing because of the university close by and all of the apartments in this area.   Our server was in training and while she did pretty good on taking care of us, she definitely gave off the impression that she was either worn out, hated her job, or just didn't want to be there. At one point she disappeared for a long period of time and so did the trainer who was supposed to be following up with our table.   Another thing to note is that I was very much looking forward to my sandwich, but when I took a bite I had to pull a black shoulder length hair out of my mouth. Typing this right now makes me gag. Oh my sweet baby Jesus it was so disgusting.   So yeah, now I have an aversion to Panini's."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a friend. I have been to this paninis before but at that time I was not a yelper.  I am in between jobs so i had the opportunity to stop in for lunch. Walking in the place looked empty. However, everyone was out on the patio, right where we wanted to sit.  I ordered a pretty standard item; turkey wrap with fries. The food came so fast that we were surprised. Fries were fresh and the food was decent. I guess it's hard to mess up a turkey wrap. Beer was as you expect beer to be; delicious.  The real reason for leaving this review was that our waitress was awesome. She took care of us and did everything in a timely manor.   We were sure to leave a good tip."}
{"text":"We enjoy the trivia nights on Tuesdays! If we are in the mood to hang out with friends and exercise our trivia brains we head up to Panini's on Tuesday nights. Trivia starts around 8 and they usually play 2 games. The first for prizes, the second for fun. We usually suck, but we bring my boyfriend because he has a lot of random knowledge that may surprise you!  The food here is ok... If we were not playing we would not come here just to eat. They have a pretty good bar and the servers are always usually pretty nice."}
{"text":"I will rate this on the few times I've been there. The food is always good, not excellent. Never had to wait too long but i wish the menu was a tad larger. Walking passed it on the street,  I love to see the customers outside on the patio,  it's so festive."}
{"text":"I come to Panini's when I don't want to be ashamed for getting trashed. i do NOT come to Panini's for a good quiet night and a night of delicious food.   Honestly, this bar is the place to be for college kids, drunken nights, and black out nights. I'm embarrassed to say this but I probably come here about 2-3 times a month because it makes me feel young again... hahahaa.  but uhm, if you want a chill night with friends and a place to have fun, this is the place to be. But definitely not a place that will give you an idea of what Cleveland is like or what good cleveland food is."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I am giving this place a four because it had Big Ten volleyball on their TV one night I was walking by.  Panini's is your typical bar with so so food (the pretzels that we got were actually pretty delish), with decent beers on tap and a chill atmosphere.  I loved that they had volleyball on the tv but their service was so so, with such a slow night I was expecting a bit more.  I've been here for Trivia which is actually pretty fun.  On a Friday or Sat night it gets pretty busy, but you can usually find a place to sit which is pretty nice. Wish the staff would have been more attentive but you can't go wrong with the pretzel appetizer.  I can't wait till they start selling Christmas beer!!"}
{"text":"I'm between a 3 and 4 on Panini's in terms of overall food, but there's a lot of open seating, they cater to large groups, and the service was really good. So, two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"A giant overstuffed sandwich is the perfect way to ward off the next days hangover. I hadn't had a Panini's sandwich for years. So after catching a show nearby with some friends we decided to stop in for one. Guess what, they don't serve sandwiches late at night. Strike one.   Our group decided to order some greasy food from the \"late night\" menu.  It was fair and it was food. As we were eating one of the employees walks over to our group and tells us we have to leave \"I don't care if you have a tab, just get out\". OK, I'm not sure what is going on at this point.   It turns out one of our group had walked behind the bar. It's an easy mistake to make given the layout of the bar. In all fairness my friend was pretty drunk but he wasn't causing a disturbance and the rest of the group was minding it's business.   We paid our bill and left with our food less than half eaten. There was no reason to stick the server because some self important employee over reacted and then refused to back down or listen to reason.  Confrontation should have been a last resort not a first.   I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came to paninis around 1230pm was told the kitchen was closed sat down 10 mins later people walk in order food and get served never coming back"}
{"text":"This review is based on the three times I stopped in here while I was visiting a friend in the area. The first time was when the Cavs were playing Golden State. We walked in and it was packed (of course). It was seat yourself so we kind of walked around the place looking for seats and eventually we did get two seats at the bar. I appreciated their patio and the amount of televisions around the whole place, which was super efficient for games and groups. They have booths, tables, a whole bar with a lot of seating, and an outside patio.   So game night was packed and I found the service plenty because we had our drinks refilled and asked enough times if we were doing okay. We both ordered salads - I got the spinach salad without bleu cheese and crutons. It came with balsamic dressing. The price was ten something and at first I was a bit put off by it but when I saw the salad, I had no problem. It came in a large bowl and was delicious! I was really satisfied with my meal. I didn't get any alcohol so I can't comment on drinks.  We came back again for the same salads and while it wasn't nearly as busy, we still received great customer service. The people were friendly and the salad was fairly consistent and just as delicious. Their bathrooms are clean and there's always something on television to check out. The final time we came in, they were short staffed. I got the same salad (I guess I just really loved it haha) and water. I saw they were really busy on the patio so I observed as they made drinks and tried to keep up on good customer service. We sat at the bar and asked if we can have a different channel on the television right in front of us (it wasn't busy at the time). Mike at the bar changed the channel for us, which was really nice of him! If I lived in the area I would definitely make this one of my regular place."}
{"text":"Panini's is another Coventry restaurant on my Cleveland Heights Cheap Grub list.  They have two pizza specials. Sundays for football they have $6 one topping pizzas. Then Thursday nights is pizza night again with 1/2 price pizzas.  Now, for the actual experience... I live in the neighborhood and when it comes time to watch sports on Coventry it really comes down to two choices in my mind Panini's or The Lizard. I go for The Lizard most of the time because they have better taps and a lot more bottles. They also have ridiculously addictive popcorn at The Lizard. You find a pretty diverse crowd at Panini's but sometimes it seems that the younger guys are trying a little too hard to be tough. I get a better feeling over at Winking Lizard. It is a bit more relaxed and feels more intimate.  BUT, Panini's has the patio. So for a sunny Sunday afternoon in the fall, there's not much question that Panini's has to be the place. The atmosphere is not exactly relaxing, but it still works.   The only problem with sitting outside is that a lot of times people stand in front of the TVs so you can't see your game unless you're sitting at the bar. Also their choice of what game to put on the loudspeakers seems strange to me. Last weekend the Packers and the Redskins were in OT, but instead they had the 1st quarter of the Titans and Cowboys on the stereo. Now I don't care what your teams are (the Browns were done at this point) but we should be able to agree that OT is more interesting and more deserving of audio than the 1st quarter of just about any game. We asked the server and his answer was \"Well that game's almost over.\" HELLO!?!? McFly?  Our food and drink experience, while nothing spectacular, was pretty good overall. We ordered a pitcher of Blue, because that's their game day special and the nachos. I love nachos. I judge sports bars by their nachos. They were just OK, here. Well, they were good, but very conventional. nothing exciting. On the good side, they were plenty big enough and had lots of cheese. On the bad side, the tomatoes were soggy and mealy and they give a pretty small cup of salsa with the nachos.   Now that I have that off my chest, I would say that if you go to Panini's you should probably try the sandwiches. I have not had one in a long time, but I do remember liking them back in the day. Anyway, that's what the place is famous for, so get a sandwich with fries in it!"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I am new to the Cleveland area and when you're new you have to go where the few people you know, by proxy, take you to, and now unfortunately I have been to this place twice in the 3 short weeks I have been in your/my city.    This is the type of place I never went to even when I was in college, just not my kinda place, maybe I'm too cool, maybe I'm too snobby, but this place is just too much of a meat market.  If I were like a 20 yr old dude looking for a super drunk girl at midnight to bring home for some questionable late-night hookup, then this would be the place I would go.  I have seen too many girls here just sloppy sloppy drunk (even seen a girl puke in the city trashcan just down the street).  That aside, the beer selection isn't so bad for the kinda of place it is, so that makes it a 2 star for me because it at least has that going for it.  I did make the unfortunate mistake of eating here once.  I don't eat meat so the salad and black bean burger were my only options.  The salad was very sad and the bbb was definitely some sort of frozen restaurant depot or something of that sort.    overall, this just isn't my kinda place, if it's yours I don't judge you"}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's your standard restaurant/bar serving American food. The service was good at 1130am and the patio seating near the outdoor bar was enjoyable. Restaurant appeared clean and prices standard. My food was fine and I could eat here again but I won't be craving it. My husband did enjoy his wings. My black bean burger was fine but a little bland."}
{"text":"Mm overstuffed sandwiches.  Ever wanted a sandwich on fresh cut bread that is filled with meat, coleslaw, tomatoes, cheese and fries?  Then look no further.  Quite tasty, although I do wish the coleslaw were a bit more flavorful.  Boneless wings are just so-so, they basically taste like mini chicken nuggets coated with wing sauce."}
{"text":"2.5 stars? I can't believe this place has such low reviews. For a chain restaurant (a local chain!), it has decent food. Overstuffed sandwiches are great. I recently came here for an informational interview (despite already landing a job) and the atmosphere was good. I didn't think the music would be as loud as it was for a Tuesday.   It was pretty desolate though. Drinks are reasonably priced (but I'm used to Chicago prices so for all I know they might not be). No drink specials here though, kind of sad.  Like I said, the food was delicious. Service was really good."}
{"text":"We stop by for a drink at the bar... we wait & wait... one bar tender is chatting with other patrons, the other serving others.. neither come by... I try waving them down to no avail - screw the place, we walked out"}
{"text":"I don't know, dude - it's not that my burger and chips weren't tasty, but the service/atmosphere were just kind of blah. Also I ordered my burger medium rare with a fried egg on it and both burger and egg came out pretty well done. What's the point of getting an egg on your burger if the yolk is hard??"}
{"text":"Panini's is not supposed to be some posh hipster place, it is a sportsbar.  As a sportsbar, these are the things I look for:  giant TVs, cleanliness, lots of dark wood, a jukebox with current hits and tons of sing along classics for when there are no sports events going on, cheap pitchers of beer, and greasy yet yummy bar food to cure and/or prevent hangovers.  Panini's succeeds in all of these areas, thus the 4 stars.  There is even a TV in the girls bathroom for when you are waiting in line - sheer genius.   Plus, if you become a regular, the owner and staff will treat you with respect....i.e. they will remember you and serve you first when it is crowded!  This place was my law school version of cheers, and there is nothing better than a panini sandwich stuffed full of delicious fries and cheesy goodness when you are drunk on cheap beer."}
{"text":"Even though Panini's is a chain this location still has an authentic Coventry feel. Friendly bartenders, plenty of screens, patio make this space comfortable although much smaller than other Panini's. The neighborhood has undergone many changes in recent history, but I don't have an issue with this one."}
{"text":"We threw my brother a surprise 30th birthday party at the Coventry Panini's and had a great experience.  Jeremy helped me coordinate and plan the event.  He was easy to work with and very responsive.  They even closed off half of the bar for the party which worked out great.  Food was good.  Evan was responsible for us that night and he did an excellent job.  He kept checking in to make sure everything was okay.  We never had any problems.  I would recommend this bar if you want to have a laid back fun party."}
{"text":"- If you wanna stay in the neighborhood but don't wanna watch it at home , you go to the neighborhood Panini's. Relaxed crowd to enjoy games with, great food, fair prices."}
{"text":"Quantity- good. Quality- meh.  I've only been to Panini's to meet up with friends for drinks, but never for the food. Today was different- why not, let's try the food!  I got the overstuffed cheesesteak- a sandwich with thick white bread, coleslaw, fries, and a little bit of cheesesteak in it. Ummmm. Cool concept, but it was definitely dry. Dry dry dry. Could have definitely used some sauce. I added some spicy Asian rooster sauce- and that did the trick for me.  The fries were soggy, and just overall, I wasn't too impressed. My colleagues felt the same way with their food as well.  Don't get me wrong- the portions were HUGE and we ate our fill. But quality? Ummm...not a fan of the food...."}
{"text":"This place is very loud and confusing. You never know where to order drinks and you never know where you should wait for your drinks. Their wings are also pretty bad. It was really salty for most of the flavors. I probably wouldn't go there again, unless you wanna watch some sports over drinks with your bros."}
{"text":"Panini's is a favorite of my boyfriends and we came during a recent visit back to Cleveland. It was Labor Day so it was quiet, the hostess was somewhat distant but greeted us and advised us to just sit wherever. She also was the first to greet us at the table, but it seems several people were helping around the restaurant, so we saw many faces throughout lunch. This makes for a slightly disconnected feel, but not a huge deal. The service is casual but remains attentive.  My boyfriend got the turkey overstuffed like he likes to do, and he enjoyed it as he always does! Though this is a classic and iconic item for Panini's, it is a bit too much for me. I do enjoy that they have several black bean options available for vegetarians. For this visit I enjoyed the Fiesta Black Bean Salad. It is a large portion of salad with some of my favorite salad toppings. The only thing I noticed is that the black bean burger was slightly overcooked, it had developed that (little too) charred on the grill taste. It was still alright, so I was able finish the salad.   No major complaints about the restaurant. It is clean and provides several beer and food options. Staff is present but you have to be ready for just a chill environment when you go. I will say this, it might be nice to have just a little bit of a friendlier interaction with staff in the future. This remains to be a great scene for some drinks and especially late night eats."}
{"text":"I used to come here trolling for college chicks. I just feel like an old creep now. Sometimes, miracles do happen but like Prince said in Sometimes it Snows in April:  Sometimes it snows in April. Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad. Sometimes I wish life was never ending, And all good things, they say, never last."}
{"text":"They have good food at reasonable prices.  The music is very loud.  Other than that I would recommend it for a quick bite to eat.    Service was also very good."}
{"text":"Yeah brah, Panini's brah! This place is miserable. Service is not so great, but not terrible. Food is pretty meh. Drinks are reasonable, but you won't find anything special. But what makes it intolerable for me is the demographics of the place- a bunch of cool, fratty guys and their girlfriends. I guess that it wouldn't bother me that much if it were somewhere else, but it's ON COVENTRY! Coventry has been the counter-culture center of Cleveland for a long time, and there it is, crawling with these types down the street. If you're on Coventry, not a college student, and not an idiot, skip this place and go to La Cave du Vin or B-side or something. Anywhere else is really ok."}
{"text":"Was here Sunday about 3 ish. I had to he Rueben it was very good. The waitress was very attentive. We sat outside way in the back. She said that table was easily missed but we had no issues at all. I seen a few bad reviews on Facebook and here but I had a great experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place!  it has everything:  1. Amazing food. Seriously, the sandwiches are fantastic...I've never thought to order anything else because they're just so good. The portion sizes are pretty generous too and prices are reasonable.   2. Cheap drinks. They always have some sort of beer or drink special of some sort, and it's not like a \"$5.00 for a beer\" special either...  3. TVs galore--it's a great place to watch sports because they have tons of big TVs that are visible all throughout the restaurant.   I took 'em down one star because service can be spotty at times and the seating is a bit uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, though, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Okay Panini empire, I've now visited my fourth installment and I continue to be happy. I like Panini's for the casual vibe, cheap beers and bar food. At this particular encounter on Coventry, we stopped in for a quick pitcher, which only cost a mere $5 (domestic draft). Service was friendly, albeit a little busy but she did keep up with the pace. Huge outdoor screen to watch sports games. I'm a fan of their pizza here, have yet to try what seems to be nice selection of wing sauces. Daily food specials available. Like arnold schwarzeneggar said, i'll be bach"}
{"text":"Calling before you come to see if the kitchen is open you get put on wait and they never come back. Once we get there nobody wants to wait on us, after 15 minutes we get a server and the drinks never came. Maybe under staffed or lack of a caring staff. Bottom line this paninis is just poorly managed."}
