{"text":"I went as a recommendation from a friend and now that's in question...I came..I bought..I threw away!...the wings or should I say wingdings were small and dry..the fries with sauce were awful and the oil seals \"er\" onion rings were sogged with grease...Never again!..this is a greasy spoon passing itself off as a restaurant..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here and the food alone deserves five stars but the customer service takes one away. They have the absolute worst customer service of any place that I have ever been. Always call ahead or you will be sitting in the tiny hole in the wall forever."}
{"text":"Great service call ahead they get pretty busy me and my family eat their food all the time"}
{"text":"Aside from the long wait after calling ahead, the food was good. I ordered a steak philly with fries and the portions and price perfectly matched. The sandwich wasn't running over with meat or greasy which was kind of disappointing, but it was still good. I was told the phillies used to be loaded and sloppy (a great thing) which now makes me want the original experience. I would definitely go again, but I would order an hour in advance."}
