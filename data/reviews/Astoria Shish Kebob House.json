{"text":"My hummus appetizer was huge and delicious. I wanted to eat all of it but it really is better for sharing. I love lamb so I had the 8oz lamb chops. Really good I wish there had been more. My potatoes were good but nothing to write home about. The rice was nicely spiced. The lamb was served with tzatziki which really added to the flavour. Nice atmosphere and beautiful outdoor patio. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Great \"vegetarian plate\". If I want Greek food, I always go there.   Friendly service, lots of seating, outdoor patio."}
{"text":"We have given Astoria on Rutherford a couple tries, once when they opened in the restaurant and the second time a couple days ago with takeout. Both time service was extremely slow (we were told 1/2 hour pick up and it took an hour) and frankly the food isn't worth the wait. Our salad was soggy and saturated with dressing and my spanokopita was very dry. My hubby's meat was very burnt. Definitely does not compare to Astoria on the Danforth. We will not be going back again...too bad too because we don't have another good greek restaurant near us."}
{"text":"Not the great Astoria it used to be.   Dry garlic bread ($1) Burnt bland pork souvlaki ($17) Salmon and shrimp ($21) served in a desolate plate that looked like jail food.  Salad that was depressingly stale.    But the worst part of this sad disappointment is that we were served left over food (some potatoes had bite marks!!) and the server dismissed the concerns saying some pieces were cut by hand and that the sauce gave it the bite off shape!!  Overall, left over food or not the point is that for $60 I expected more. Quality and portions were worse than food court meals that you usually get for less than $20.   Don't recommend the food. But most importantly can't recommend a place where there is risk of left over food being re-served."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in Mississauga for Greek food, the tzatziki here is to die for! My bf always gets the pork souvlaki and the saganaki is always a must for us."}
{"text":"Order:    - Golden Fried Calamari   - Large Pork Souvlaki   - Roasted Potatoes   - French Fries  Price:  I found the price to be quite fair given the portion of my meal.  The prices seem pretty similar to other local Greek cuisine restaurants and given the quality, I would say the price is very reasonable.  Size:  I found the size of the meal quite large (which in my books is amazing!).  The Golden Fried Calamari was perfect for sharing and the main course, Pork Soulvaki with sides, was very filling.  Quality:  The quality was exceptional.  The Golden Fried Calamari came out very quickly and tasted amazing with the Tzatziki sauce provided.  When the main course came around, I found the Pork Souvlaki a little dry however the roasted potatoes tasted great!  This was the first time I experienced the dry Pork Souvlaki as prior visits left my mouth craving for more as each piece of meat was usually well cooked, tender and you could really taste the cinnamon spices applied to the meat; this really complimented the meal.  Overall:  I will be returning to this restaurant whenever I am in the mood for Greek and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving the same cuisine in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant back in July.  I have no intention of going back.  The service was horrible, it took almost 20 minutes just to be served our drinks.  We ordered the chicken brochette plate, and although the portions were quite big, the quality was lacking.  The chicken was bland, the 'greek salad' (if you even want to call it that) was soggy iceburg lettuce, a few pieces of un-ripened tomato and a dash of feta crumble.  Considering the cost is $15 or more a plate, the quality should be so much better.  If you are looking for tasty greek food at a reasonable price, this is not the place."}
{"text":"They are very polite, professional and on time. Your food arrives as ordered, hot and fresh. Restaurant business is not for everyone, and these people have done a great job. Always a pleasure to to go back"}
{"text":"Asteria is the best place to go for a no-fuss meal.   The place is family-run and there's nothing fancy about the menu, but they sure do know their Greek food. You can have your basic souvlaki (chicken or lamb) or gyro on a pita , or if you're feeling hungrier, go for the full meal which adds a Greek salad, potatoes, and rice.   I should mention that I'm  picky about my Greek salads, and I like theirs."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to check it out for myself. There were 4 of us, and we thought it was fantastic. Zero problems and the food tasted great, and had decent portions. I will agree that the staff could be a tad more tentative, but we weren't bothered by it. Sometimes too much attention is a bad thing too. Their tzatziki  sauce is amazing!!! I'm going back just for that. Don't be discouraged by all the negative reviews, I would say check it out for yourself and make your own kind up. Also the place is very big, so I am keeping this place in mind for large group outings."}
{"text":"Well the flaming cheese for $10 was good.  Poor - wait staff was rude and argumentative.  When asked how the pork kebob was cooked, he said they had to cook it well done for health reasons. He said the can't cook the pork medium rare. I don't mind a server telling me their policy, but he was really rude about it.  Pool- Ordered the lamb, since we could order that medium rare. arrived medium to medium well. Sent it back. new dish came medium rare to rare.   Poor- Very chewy. not a great cut of meat. What ever part the lamb they us, they should braze it, too tough to grill.  Did I mention the flaming cheese was good?"}
{"text":"Astoria...went here for lunch today, it was very packed. It was my first visit, and definitely will be the last. I came with several friends, we are descendants from a certain ethnicity.  Things they did wrong..... - Gave me the wrong order (and a more expensive one!), I ordered from their LUNCH menu  the beef souvlaki sandwich, which has a side of fries. When my order came, it was the bigger LUNCH ENTREE beef souvlaki, with two sides (fries and rice, which the waiter decided himself). When I asked about it, he just said this is the only thing you can order during lunch time, not even apologizing. What the heck, I saw people eating souvlaki sandwich here and there.  - IT TOOK FOREVER, and by forever I mean f..o..r..e..v..e..r.. The people at the table next to us arrived 20 mins after we have placed our order, then theirs came first, finished eating, paid, left..and still none of us got ours yet! Something to do about them being white...?  - Horrible service. The waiter was an older guy, with a somewhat curt tone to his voice. Well, dude, I've been in restaurants way more packed than this and still able to maintain professionalism in giving top notch customer service.   The good thing about my visit? The food was okay, haven't got any stomach ache so far (1+ hr after). Hopefully I didn't get any of the said \"leftover sides\", just found out from reading the reviews.  Not recommended. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place for greek food! Our table started off with the classic Saganaki and 2 dips (hummus and tzatziki) -- delish! Came with 2 baskets of whole  wheat pitas which were warm and soft :) We each had  different entrees ;  Grilled calamari salad ( calamari was grilled perfectly), small lamb souvlaki dinner, large pork  souvlaki dinner,  and a salmon dinner  -- all came with a starter greek salad and rice, potatoes, and mixed veg.   Will definitely  come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome souvlaki!  My parents took me here when I was a little girl, and now my husband and I take our daughters here too.  The BEST beef souvlaki in the city.  Creamy tzaziki that rivals tzaziki in the Greek islands.  I would recommend this place for souvlaki until the cows come home (then would hopefully skewer those cows and slather them in my Astoria tzaziki and enjoy!)."}
{"text":"From the plastic menus to the overly-seasoned/buttery food to the cheerful but inexperienced servers, Astoria is basically a Greek-themed TGI Fridays with prices that would be appropriate at a much nicer restaurant.   The best part of our meal was probably the tzatziki and pita, even though the dip was extremely garlicky. The salmon and veggies were cooked too long--the salmon was too dry and the veggies were too soft--and both were smothered in a buttery sauce. The quail was just OK. On both plates, the rice and/or potato took up most of the space and were not seasoned to our liking.   Service was friendly and quick until we finished eating. We waited 15 minutes to ask our server for the check before giving up and asking another server to go find him.   In all, we paid $75 for two entrees, one appetizer, and one drink. I think $30-40 would have been reasonable for the ambiance/food (though still would not have warranted returning). But $75?? No way.   Pass on Astoria Fridays. There are much better options."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here all the time years ago. Food was amazing I would always order the chicken dinner which they don't have anymore on their menu and get a side of their own made hot sauce which when we asked the employees this time we went we got a  replied \"Greeks don't eat hot sauce\". So I had then ordered the reg. chicken souvlaki. AWFUL! did not enjoy my food at all and the same went for the other 2 people I was dining with. Service was very pleasant besides the comment of the hot sauce, but the food not worth the price. Also there famous cheese sizzle platter not the greatest either. Very disappointed with how this place turned out because I've recommend this place to a lot of people. Will not be going back. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is my fav Greek place anywhere in Toronto. Pork souvalki is juicy and flavourful. Greek salad is great. Friendly service."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  The food is always prepared very well and the service is always excellent.  We always enjoy our time here.  Never rushed."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in 2 years. The food was good and i can't complain about the price either.   The service was not bad, considering the recent visit was not very busy environment on a monday night.   I can only complain about the group seating in the center, they were very loud.   Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb souvlaki came with a small Greek salad and tsaziki. It was the tastiest salad that I have eaten in years. Friendly staff and great service. This franchised location seemed to me to have better tasting dishes than the original Danforth location."}
{"text":"good stuff really yum little not cheap. he took my money and made me food it was great! wow thanks. AND HE GAVE ME A FREE BOTTLE OF WATER."}
{"text":"Sadly, the quality seems to have dropped here and the portions size shrunk. There was brown/limp lettuce in my salad even though they were making them fresh. Probably need to find a new fave Greek spot."}
{"text":"My last visit to Astoria did not go all that well. While I love coming here because I enjoy the food. The waiter ruined it for me on my last visit. He was very slow, running around like a maniac when the restaurant was empty. He took forever to come and take our order and did not even come back once. We had to ask another waiter to get us a drink because he didn't come by for the entire duration of our meal. When we asked to pack up the rest of our meal and get our bill, it took him almost 15 minutes to return. I will probably go back but will request a different server if I happen to get this guy."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant on the Danforth- Greek Town!  You can't really go wrong with any of the Greek restaurants in this area - we have tried just about all of them over the years, but if you want the best one, Astoria is it. Patio if great. Service always fantastic.  One litre bottles of wine: great. It probably has the largest seating capacity in the area so getting is usually not a problem. Opa!"}
{"text":"Back to Astoria for some cravings of grilled calamari so I convinced some ppl to come with me as well this time. When we entered, it was on a sunday after 9pm, so its not busy. We sat down, and my friend got thirsty and there was no server to attend to us for over 5 mins. He is a bit impatient, but its b/c he is thirsty as well. Anywho, my gf and I shared their grilled calamari app and their large chicken souvlaki dinner.  Grilled calamari was just the way I remembered with 3 generous portion for the same set price. The chicken souvlaki was moist meat and cooked well. Our friends got the lamb chops and mentioned it was chewy for them. The downside of this is our server who is an elder person only takes our order and we never seen him again until the bill. I still gave him a decent tip, but I don't know if my friends did since they were a little annoyed with the service.  Good thing this place is very close by to Chester Station for anyone taking the TTC (Take The Crap)."}
{"text":"Love the great comfort food this place offers, they also have a fab patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Very nice meal, we had Beef Shish, Salmon and Shrimp. Dinnertime. Service was excellent, quick and cheerful. We had that flaming cheese, it was delicious. The only downside was the crying babies, with no partitions, not that this is controllable, but with the open concept, and being a bit \"family style\", it was less than perfect for our party of 4 adults. I would have given 3.5 given this option, but not quite a 4. Would return for a causal meal with the kids."}
{"text":"Both food and service are mediocre. If you are vegetarian, you won't starve but will definitely fare better someplace else."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and Astoria's pork souvlaki dinner consistently satisfies.    The meat chunks are always juicy, tender and impressive in size, even for the small size portion.  The salad is a generous size, greens are always fresh and crispy.  And the tzatziki has a great garlic flavour.  Service is prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience at this location. It was a busy night and while waiting the hostess and manager were letting people jump the line. After finally seating it took forever for the waiter to serve us. The food was really bad. The beef and pork was tough and overcooked, The rice was mushy and potatoes over cooked. We did complain to the waiter and he said a lot of people were complaining that night. There was no adjustment to the bill so I paid $19.00 for a Greek salad!   Would not return nor recommend this location."}
{"text":"I visited on the opening week for this delightful Mediterranean /Greek restaurant near my house in Newmarket. Right from the door this place impresses, great decor and lush lighting set the mood for any meal. I was there before the dinner rush so the service was very quick and polite.   There is another Astoria in greektown and this location does not disappoint either, the calamari is a definite must try, its the best you can find in York Region. My table ordered the Greek staples, souvlaki of every kind and they were all succulent and perfectly seasoned. Only the salmon was a little below par, but was still decent. The potatoes and rice were perfectly done and served generously, a small portion is almost enough for two people to eat after appetizers. For anyone seeking Greek food in the York region this new location is the best the area can do in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Used to be good , went there today and ordered 3 lamb souvlaki.  They all came over cooked , we returned 2 , 1 came back better the other came back over cooked as well . The meat quality was really really bad , you would get better meat at any other place . I believe it is not even lamb, it looks like beef with added lamb flavour ."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable place. No mistake. Good food, big portion and very friendly staffs. However, The food is full of plate. Isn't the plate too small? I can not eat food without losing rice out of the plate and made a mess on the table. Please use bigger dishes. Plating is a part of cooking."}
{"text":"A-so-so-storia: I've been coming to you for years upon years and you've been my go-to.    Was it because I could find no better souvlaki on the Danforth?  Not necessarily....I simply haven't had time to try, to be honest.  But your portions are pretty decent, prices are so-so (a little higher than one would like, but not outrageous), and your tzaziki is always delish.  So I guess you'll continue to be my go-to until I have time to look around for another place to satisfy my Greek fix."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday. The food was decent but it didn't wow me to say the least. While my friends and I were at the end portion of our dinner I hear from the waitress that the place was dusty.I was completely disgusted and I will never come back to Astoria again. Much better restaurants on the Danforth that I would like to try."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often with my girlfriend and family for special occasions. The food is always consistent and portions are actually very big. The service is good and if anything ever does happen to go wrong the manager is quick to help you out and take care of it for you. I have never has a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Why no pita bread with your meal? Server clearly attended better to females and better dressed people then myself which came in casual. The rice was bland..and as a well service was horrible."}
{"text":"Great food for great price, but they charge for every order of pita. Their dip was over $10 and pitas are extra everytime you reorder. Not cool. I don't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Large portions -- the chicken souvlaki dinner is delicious! The prices are fair given the large portions. Very good value! & a nice environment...would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised when I see this restaurant full. I've been here plenty of times and regretted it each time.  Astoria is one of many Greek restaurants in Greektown. This place is spacious, has a nice patio, and it's very close to a parking lot and subway station (Chester). The décor is nothing special and the staff seem uninterested most of the time, and they provide bad to okay service.  The menu looks great, too bad their food isn't. The menu consists of hot and cold appetizers, salads, sandwiches, meat, seafood and vegetarian dishes, wine, sides and more. The prices are okay, the portions can be better, and the food has always been a disappointment. My food has either been over-spiced or bland and boring. The tzatziki has way too much garlic in it! I always taste it the next entire day, it's gross. My Greek friends say that Astoria is anglicized Greek food- not authentic.  They're other better Greek restaurants to go to in Greektown. If you're looking for good Greek food and good service, I would not recommend Astoria."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have aten at Astoria; overall I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely recommend it. I found both the food and service to be good. I came with a party of 14 people almost last minute. We called 30 mins ahead and they were able to make room for us at such a short notice, plus when an extra member joined our party they went out of their way to arrange the tables so that we were sitting together.   The food is moderately pricey however, the portion sizes were proportional to the amount of money paid - with free re fills on soda's. So that was good. I was pleasantly surprised to see how large the greek salad I received was and was thrilled with it's taste. It had a great ratio of salad to feta cheese and onion. We had a plate of sides which came with spanikopita's, deep fried calamari, dolmades and a nice dollop of tzatziki and hummus.   I like how they offered both deep fried and grilled calamari. I ordered the sautéed shrimp dinner that came with rice and vegetables. My dinner was delicious but my brother didn't enjoy his pork souvlaki as much. He mentioned it was burnt a bit and the fries were pretty plain.  I didn't get to try the deserts but they looked very nice sitting on other peoples tables lol. I will definitely order desert next time I visit."}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite Greek restaurant! Reasonable price, good service and great food. Their tzatziki is one of a kind - and I absolutely love it! It just makes the food so much better. From the menu, I recommend the calamari and their pork souvlaki. The salad that comes with the souvlaki is also fantastic. If you have some room for dessert, I recommend Caffe Demetre just couple blocks down.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that I love love love their tzatziki. If you love garlic this is for you. I think it ends up in your lungs. I often bring home leftovers so I can smear it on toast. I know..who eats tzatziki for breakfast?  Me - if it's that tasty!  Other items are alright - it's you usual standard Greek food. What kills me is why they serve Greek salad with lettuce. I have yet to find a place in Toronto that serves traditional greek salad off the bat. They have it on their menu as a traditional horiatiki salad but you have to order it specifically.   Large portions, decent service and can cater to large groups.  Great tzatziki!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pork Souvlaki!  The Calamari was toooo salty! The Flamed cheese is a must have!  Loved the customer service. Great Place will defiently be back"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! Awesome food, great atmosphere and good prices and it's in the heart of danforth!"}
{"text":"Would loved to have given this greek restaurant a higher rating, however, the last two visits left us cold.  We always brought our friends here for great, very fresh greek food over the last decade. We just finished visiting four times in less than three weeks with different out of town houseguests and the last two dinners consisted of horribly overcooked proteins and vegetable mush.  A local friend keeps raving about Mezes. Guess we will be trying out a new greek resto. Our old fave Astoria has gone downhill in our recent visits.  They must be spending too much time concentrating on their upcoming new location up in Vaughn to care about keeping up the quality in Greektown.   Oh, and as a side note, I know it's a different location (but still the same owner, Never never never go to the Etobicoke location which opened a few years back, it seriously sucked and wouldn't even give it one star"}
{"text":"What an utter disappointment.    When I walked in, there was no one at the front to greet or seat me - or direct me as to where to place my take-out order.  I had to walk past people eating to the back of the restaurant, just to ask if I could place a take out order.  This section is where the servers pick up the food, so this could be improved on for sure.    However why I am upset and disappointed is because I spent $33 bucks on two dinners - and I had to share mine with my husband because he wouldn't eat his meal.   My chicken souvlaki came with three potato halves and about a cup of rice.  The food in the take out container was rattling around because it was basically empty!  This is a large portion??  Food court take out gives you more sides than this place - rice is pennies so i am not sure why they were being so stingy.  I am sure the chicken was what I was actually paying for - as that was the only large thing in the box.    Now for my husbands meal - the worst pork souvlaki ever.  I have no idea how this was voted the \"Astoria Award Winner\" and by WHOM???  People with no taste buds or sense of smell????   I have never - ever heard of, or tasted cinnamon in ANY souvlaki.  They didn't marinate it in the same souvlaki marinade used on the chicken -  just some cinnamon slapped on pork and grilled till it was dry as a leather sandal.     His side portion was also kiddie size and very salty.  I checked the bags but there was no toy ;)  Unfortunately it  was between this and souvlaki hut, which we've had many times .... and will keep eating - because Astoria will never get another dime out of me.    Save your pesos and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you love garlic you will love this place!  Try the tzatziki, it's the most garlicky I've ever  tried.  The beef and pork have a great cinnamon flavour to it and the salads and vegetables tasted fresh.  The food is consistently good (although no longer great) for all our visits.  The only drawback being the service.  The waiters are \"authentic\" in their no BS attitude.  They want your order quick and don't care for niceties.  Come for the food, not the service.  As other reviewers have noted, the quality has declined slightly in the past decade, although not to the degree some might claim."}
{"text":"I had the fried calamari appetizer, which I found overly salted. The breading also wasn't thick enough but on the plus side, the tzaziki was tasty and the calamari was anything but chewy.  For the main, I ordered the pork souvlaki, which I found tasty and moist. However, my side of rice was subpar. It felt like I was eating soupy rice. I wouldn't say I'd come back to this place because the food was average at best and the presentation was not the greatest - think of a fancier Swiss Chalet. I believe their plates and dishes were probably from the same provider?"}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of the Astoria on danforth but the commute was always the problem. Was very excited when they opened up the Newmarket location. We have ordered take out there several times and the food is awesome! Large chunks of tender chicken and delicious rice and potatoes.  Haven't eaten inside the restaurant yet but looking forward to it. Wish the restaurant was as big as the danforth location."}
{"text":"Came here because my first and second choice were not opened.   I'm not surprised at the ratings and here's why.  Cons: Prices are steep for the portion and quality Not exactly the cleanest restaurant Service is really bad No complimentary pita with greek paste or bread  Rice and roasted potatoes were average  Pros: Vegetarian wrap was filled with really tasted grill vegetables chicken was juicy  Overall... you can do better if you're in Greek Town."}
{"text":"I was at lunch here with my sister's family. The fried calamari was nice with lemon and the creamy tzatziki. I ordered the lamb souvlaki...it was a huge portion. I asked for medium-rare and it was cooked to perfection. My brother in law got the grill platter that came with chicken, lamb, and quail. It was a platter of epic proportion. Food and service was great...the older waiter was helpful despite some non-English speaking people on the table and the ensuing communication gap. Huge portions at a reasonable price. Will definitely come back again. 50 ft from Chester subway stop."}
{"text":"If we are craving a typical Greek dinner on the Danforth, this is where we go.  It is relatively consistent.  I don't think I've ever had anything other than the souvlaki dinner or the souvlaki sandwich, but it's exactly what you expect of a Danforth Greek restaurant.   You don't go for quality and innovation of food.  You don't go for trendy atmosphere and ambience.    You go for the standard, comfort food of a good garlicy, Greek souvlaki dinner.  Service is touch and go.  But it's always busy, and once you get a table it's fast!  The last time we went, our waiter abandonned us after he brought us our dinner.  We wanted another drink - but we waited for a LONG time before we finally asked another waiter to bring us one.  And then we had to practically beg for the bill.  We then noticed our waiter leaving for the evening, never having returned to our table.  We tipped accordingly.  Like I said, you're going for the comfort food, not for a nice night out.  I think of it as sort of Jack Astor's/East Side Mario/Montana's-quality food, but Greek."}
{"text":"What a great place, the environment, the waiters / waitress are very nice and friendly , and the food is to die for :)  OOOOOOPA"}
{"text":"The food was great and although prices are a bit more than you'd expect it's worth it. Like a much better Mr. Greek. The service was horrible though. It's was great up until we ordered water; we usually tip more because the tab is usually lower without beer or drinks. The food was good, fresh and arrived quick except after that is was all over. Trying to get refills was impossible and the waiter shot past our table four times. My wife had to chase him down to get the bill and pay when we were done. Maybe he had a bad day?  We'll be back and I hope it'll be 5 star worthy then."}
{"text":"My wife and I had both been to Toronto before, but this was our first time traveling there together.  We decided we wanted something for dinner that was accessible, that locals and out-of-towners alike enjoyed.  This where Greektown came in, and thanks to the man at the Raptors game, Astoria.  We were not disappointed. The appetizer sampler we ordered and the grill sample that came afterwards gave us a nice little cross-section of all that the place has to offer.  My personal favorites were the taramosalata and the pork souvlaki (the hint of cinnamon made it really unique and succulent).  This was our first foray into Greektown. It won't be our last."}
{"text":"Awseome food and service!! The grilled calamari was the best ive ever had. The portions were all very big, so sharing would definetly be an option next time. The greek chips wernt the greatest, and the tzatziki was a bit mild. But the salad was delicious! The butterfly shrimp were ordinary with shrimp sauce. Going back, but sharing everything now!"}
{"text":"Being of Greek descent, I would not recommend Astoria, definately the worst Greek food and tertible service on the Danforth. There were 11 of us, most of us ordered the souvlaki dinner, which was burned and when we told the waiter that we couldnt eat burned food ,he told us that it wasnt burned. Then the manager came and and excused that they serve burned food by telling us that the restaurant was busy and it happens. To top it off, the waiter asked for a bigher tip on top of the tip that they had automatically added to the bill.  I think Astoria is a franchise.  Toronto has many great Greek restaurants, Astoria is not one of them."}
{"text":"I was always curious about this place since the Danforth Rd location was amazing. I thought maybe it was a goo idea to have one close to home.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I ordered the fried Calamari with tzaziki and our mains were pork and souvlaki entree with rice and potatoes and Greek salad and my brother had the chicken souvlaki with fries and Greek salad. The salad was so salty and swimming in the Greek dressing.  The calamari was burnt and looked like Burger King onion rings, my pork was burned to a crisp and the chicken was pink on the inside.  The fries had to be McCain. To top it off. Never again. Period. I got pics have a look. My pork looks like poop! Literally."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time and it was wonderful.   No complaints. Great food and great service.  Was a little worried when I saw the ratings but glad we tried it anyway.  Place was clean, modern, and the staff was really great.  And the food was so much better than the Mr Greek/ Jimmy the Greek slop.  Fresh and real.  Loved that they have an open kitchen - it always makes me feel a bit better after watching way too much Hells Kitchen."}
{"text":"Service was Ok...  The food..  Bland...  Dry,  Boring comes to mind.  A couple of roasted chicken pieces with tomato on a pita... And McCain fries.  So much potential for a nice place. Fix it fast...  But I won't be back"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food! My wife and I have been going to Astoria for years. Tonight, we went here for dinner and as always we had a great time. We love this place.  I ordered the large pork souvlaki dinner and for an extra cost, I added some butterfly shrimp. The food was delicious. The salad that came with the dinner was a pretty good size. The pork was tender and the portion was nice. I also enjoyed the rice and the potatoes. As an added bonus, the extra butterfly shrimp were really great as well.  The restaurant itself is very well decorated and feels very special. It's a great place for a romantic date with a loved one. It's elegant while still being a casual place.  Two minor complaints though. One, the food is slightly on the pricey side, but this is a nice restaurant and the higher prices are somewhat expected. My dinner cost me $19 and an extra $3.29 to add 3 pieces of shrimp. Yet, as mentioned the portions are big and I was very satisfied with my meal.  Second minor complaint, the service slowed down as the night continued. Our server was great, but as the dinner rush started and the restaurant started to fill up with people, the service slowed down. Our server got really busy and that meant less check ins on us and a longer than usual wait for the bill.  Those two things did not ruin the night at all though. This is a great restaurant that I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice Greek dinner or meal. We will be back again as always!"}
{"text":"Uninterested wait staff and bland food. Went to Astoria for dinner on a Wednesday night and it was fairly quiet. The hostess was warm and quick to give us a table, however the waitress was abrupt. They brought the wrong order for me: not the end of the world, but I wasn't impressed that they didn't apologize nor did they offer a discount or dessert to make up for it. I watched my friend eat then he watched me eat!  They charged me for a side of tzatziki which tasted of garlic and not much else. I'm not a complainer, but when there are 15 other restaurants with the same menu in close proximity,  service will set you apart from the others. They set themselves apart in the wrong way. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in Toronto!  Servers are prompt, friendly and engaging-  and the pork souvlaki is second to none in my opinion. I held my birthday party here not too long ago and that was a positive experience as well.  Thanks for the great food and experiences, Astoria!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite Greek restaurant but too much have changed in the last little while. The service is passable but the food quality had taken a nose dive. I ordered beef souvlaki (rare).  They got the doneness right but some pieces were just unchewable. My wife ordered grilled calamari but this one was under cooked. Not to mention they missed the tzaziki sauce, extra veggies that my wife asked for and they don't even serve bread to go with the meal.  I used to be very happy with this restaurant but with questionable experiences in the past two visits, I think I will be staying away for a while. (Note: the tzaziki sauce has changed too that the sauce is very sour without much garlic flavor)"}
{"text":"Food at Astoria is basic and authentically Greek located in the heart of the Danforth Greek village. Fellow diners and I each got chicken shish kabobs with all the fixings. Greek salad is decent, not exceptional like the rest of the food. Very basic, almost bordering on boring/uninspired. There are much better options in the area. Would not be rushing to come back but would not decline an invitation to visit either."}
{"text":"If you want the best Greek food in the GTA I would recommend coming here. I always get the chicken souvlaki dinner, it comes with a nice large portion Greek salad, 3/4 of a whole potato, a bit more then 2 cups of cooked rice and a whole chicken skewer. The meat is always beautifully cooked with the right amount of spices, I love the first bite since it always has this nice spice kick (not heat spice but flavour spices). Now the salad is my favourite, it's always covered in feta and a nice light dressing. The potatoes and rice are a nice tasty mouth filler while you take a small piece of chicken and dip it in the tzatziki. Just a great place for great food.  That being said, if you want good service, a nice dining room, a place to take your kids then don't come here, you need to be firm with the staff and just go up and ask them for what you want. The food is too good to miss here!"}
{"text":"Love me some greek food...but nothing really wowed me here. Its more of a family restaurant...lots of kids (or maybe the day i went) & service was slow. I would rather eat at Mr. Greek Express on eglington"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food period!!! The salad to start is great, very tasty. We use to go to the danforth but this is just as good as the location there."}
{"text":"2.5  Disappointed. Only gave such a high rating because the portions were huge.   We had the Saganaki- very good cheese. But the pits that it came with were a little burnt and therefore hard.   Then the whole table ordered Souvlaki dinners. Mostly pork and chicken. The dinner comes with a giant Greek salad. Great salad, but considering the size it only came with one Kalamata olive. A little weird. The souvlaki was delicious, well seasoned, and juicy. BUT-- being aware of the portion sizes at most Greek restaurants I decided to split a dinner with my friend so we got a large size instead of a small (thinking we would get an extra skewer). It was the same size as the small version AND biting into the meat it was mostly fat. We asked the server if they made a mistake. He said that we got an extra piece and that the pieces were bigger. But they weren't and we counted the pieces. So wasn't worth getting the large portion.   For the sides we got rice and fries. (You also have a choice from potatoes and steamed veggies). The rice was a little bland, I've had better. The fries were really good though!   Anyways. Moral of the story. The food was hit and miss. And the prices were way too high. As some others have said... I've had better Greek food at the mall. For a better price too.   I'd go back if they lowered their prices."}
{"text":"the food is amazing! a little pricey but the portions are large. my fav in toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Astoria since the 1980's, have always enjoyed the food there and atmosphere.  However, tonight, I was very disappointed to say the least.  Our order seemed to take forever to get there, and when it did arrive, I was astonished to see that the pork souvlaki was burnt like charcoal and hard as rock.  The so called garlic bread did not arrive, and had to remind the gentleman server twice that we did not receive it.  Finally, I had to ask our female waitress who originally served us that we did not receive it.  She was prompt on getting the bread, however, when it did arrive, it was burnt and ripped up in pieces as though a dog had gotten to it.  I did approach the female manager of how disappointed I was with the meal, and she apologized to us how busy they were, and refunded the pork souvlaki meal and garlic bread, which was very nice.  However, the quality of the food has really gone down hill unfortunately, over the years.  I used to enjoy eating there, however, after such a let-down of an evening, I don't think I will be eating there ever again."}
{"text":"My husband and I goes there one in a while since 2010.  If we miss greek food, THIS is the place to dine at! Always enjoying their pork souvlaki plate, side with rice and fried calamari for appetizer!  Once we took our family from Oversea and they quite enjoyed their souvlaki, Tzatziki too.  Big portions, fairly good service, tasty food and homey..and yet it is reasonable for what is it.   Nothing to complaint about!"}
{"text":"Slow service and over priced. Took about 30 mins for our food to arrive. They didn't bring any bread to start and portions are small for what you paid for. Took a while before we could find our waiter to get our bill. Food okay but not worth the price tag. Will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had dinner here. They gave us no bread and there was no salad either. We ordered the pork souvlaki and it was undercooked and there was a lot of fat on the meat. I would stay away from this restaurant. We will not return to this place!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place since the most experience waiter argue with us. He was super rude and he didn t stop by and ask if we need anything the whole night. He used other way to back so he doesn't see us.At the end of the night he said okay it's your fault but I am not going to charge, really. First you never ASK how would we like and then you argue with us. I WON'T GO BACK to that place, he can't yell at us. It was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Trust the Danforth area for the best Greek food in the city.  Astoria offers mid-range pricing and great quality in a unique yet tastefully decorated restaurant.  The patio successfully transports you to a Greek island where you can relax and enjoy a meal with friends.  Try the saganaki and applaud your server as they play with fire before your very eyes."}
{"text":"Edible but I could have made the same meal with uncle Ben's rice,  frozen shrimp and butter and steamed veg. The quality does not reflect the price they charge. I had shrimp dinner and it was something I could have made better at home.    87$ for 2 meals an app and 2 wine would be a decent price if the food was good quality. There was also a hair on one of my shrimp; which I didn't complain about bc I understand that it can happen but it certainly didn't make me excited to finish my meal.   The waiter said some people like the booth better than the food.....  100% truth"}
{"text":"I'm originally from a European Mediterranian country so I'm quite picky when it comes to Mediterranian food. This restaurant was recommended to me by Torontonian Greek friends. I ordered salad with grilled chicken.   Grilled chicken was absolutely the best I've tasted in 5 years of living in Toronto. It was soft, juicy and seasoned with typical mediterranian spices.  Salad was so-so....one could tell that only the heart of the salad head (the yellow, less expensive portion) was used, as opposed to more nutritious (but more expensive) green leaves.   The portions are plentiful. Service was good. Interior is quite old, but clean and cozy.  In summary, I probably will return again."}
{"text":"YUM.   Had some dinner here with my boyfriend and his family. As students, it's always nice to venture out to different areas! The Danforth is no different in that way; it's a cute area and people are pretty into Greek stuff there (lol).   Astoria is huge so save yourself a lap around, the bathrooms are at the back, downstairs. My strawberry daiquiri wasn't that good, too warm and not boozy enough. It made me wish they brought water automatically. BUT appetizers saved that whole situation BIG TIME. Grilled squid was perfection, especially with a lil squeeze of lemon on top. The tzatziki was also great with it's warm pita alongside- get two baskets. And the show-stopper saganaki (flaming cheese) was delectable. Honestly, I was kind of full by this point but I powered through!   The mains come with a Greek salad that comes out become. It was OK but nothing to write home about. And then came my lamb chops! I got two of them and they were pretty good! Next time, I would just go for the lamb souvlaki because it's a bit cheaper and I think you'd get more meat. The rice was delicious with this tomato-y sauce drizzled on it and the roasted potatoes were cooked beautifully. I had leftovers and they were every bit as good as the meal the night before.   I really have to hand it to our waiter! He was a big, burly man who handled his tables (one with 20 people) amazingly. He didn't throw cartons our way when four people needed takaway bags, he did the packing for us table side! He gave us time and was really great. I'd definitely come back if I'm out here again and looking for some Greek."}
{"text":"I have kept trying to go back to this place because people say they like it but i have consistently been disappointed. Last time I had to return my grilled calamari as it was \"off\" and tasted like chemicals (i later read that rotten seafood releases ammonia). Tonight was the last straw as i had dinner with my parents and the service was slow and bad though it wasn't that busy. I avoided the seafood but the cuts of meat were so sinewy and inedible, we all left a bit hungry."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that the staff are awesome in this place. The atmosphere is also amazing. Love the look and the fireplace everything looks very rustic. The food was good however not great. It tastes like every other greek restaurant. I would say a bit better but I was really hoping for more in taste. But again what else can you do with souvlaki potatoes and rice? I also ordered battered shrimp. All of the food was very good but again nothing outstanding.   For sure I would go back."}
{"text":"My first time at a Greek restaurant with friends and family. Food here is delicious! We ordered the hummus as an appetizer, it comes with pita as well which was good. We ordered the calamari as well which was by far the best calamari I ever had. Definitely recommend getting those. I ordered the chicken souvlaki with rice and fries. It also came with Greek salad. The price is decent for the portion they give you. Environment and service was great. Waitress kept coming back to make sure our food was good and got us our water. Definitely will be back here again."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends.  I had the pork souvlaki, and other two friends got chicken and lamb.  Portion sizes are good.  I felt satisfied after the meal.   The fried calamari was ok.  Nothing special. Fries were good. Swapped pieces of souvlaki so we could get a small taste of each.  Chicken was dry and over cooked. Pork was ok, but slightly over cooked as well.  The lamb was spot on though.  Service wise I'd give them a 4.  Food 3. Food portion 4.  I would go back to try a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for Greek food and the wife and I don't feel like travelling all the way to the Greek town this is our go to place. The many times I have been here I've always had a good experience. Friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"We waited for a table for 20 minutes, fair enough .. when we were seated we waited another 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us .. no such luck, so we left and went to Mr Greek where we were served right away .. good job Astoria, keep up the that Greek economy  .."}
{"text":"Bad quality food.  Their prices are only marginally lower.  But there food is noticeably lower in standard in comparison to other restaurants in the area.  Even Mr. Greek and The Friendly Greek are better than Astoria.  Their fried calamari was disgusting.  Very rubbery and long stringy pieces kept on getting stuck in my friend's teeth.  lol.  It tasted like it was frozen.  Their grilled calamari was not charred properly.I couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"Ordered: Taramasalata App Pork Souvlaki on Bun Grilled Salmon Dinner  -taramasalata and salad that came with salmon were served first, they were both fine -the pork souvlaki was fatty & chewy, seemed like poor quality pork -the salmon was the worst salmon I have ever tasted, it tasted frozen and it was like a big baked puff, when you put your fork in the middle it was more liquid  I know we shouldn't order salmon at a Greek restaurant, but come on!"}
{"text":"I would never go back to this restaurant. Used to be great but too many things have changed.. I ordered grilled calamari dinner and extra vegetable instead of rice or fries.. When the order arrived I saw only 2 little slices of red peppers and 2 broccolis.The calamaris were not well seasoned and vegetables were really mushy. When I asked for some bread to go along with my meal they charged extra money for it and it was a small pita cut in 4 pieces without any butter or olive oil.. My husband ordered beef souvlaki dinner and when he asked for vegetable instead of other sides it was again extra 2.99... Came with lame portion of broccoli and red peppers. There were some questionable beef slices he was never able to chew..  We totally felt taken advantaged from the restaurant, came out really unhappy. Totally not worth paying almost 70 dollars for some mushy vegetables and poorly prepared meals.."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their homemade Tzatziki sauce, it was one-of-a-kind and super delicious (creamy like yogurt). The portions are also very large, and I really enjoyed the way they prepared the lamb and how it tasted. My only complain would be the price (although I understand it's to compensate for their large portion sizes, it adds up pretty quickly if every one in your party orders their own entree) and decor. I understand this may be because it's more of a family-based restaurant, so it gives a home-y, cafeteria-type feeling rather than being in a restaurant.  I would probably revisit again in the future, but again, I feel that some of the prices are quite expensive for the meats and their portions are not for people who have small stomachs or are not eating with a large party. They also have similar choices throughout their entire menu, and everything seemed to be in combos, so I had a hard time deciding what exactly I wanted."}
{"text":"Amazing Tzaziki! Went here for lunch today and it was delicious.  Order the Saganaki, OPA! They flambé it at the table. Nice touch! We shared the large souvlaki plate. The chicken was nicely marinated and tender! They could definitely up the rice portion, but other than that the service was friendly and prompt.  Definitely worth a visit. 6$ sangria :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this location about six times over the years.  Their menu hasn't changed.  Their service this time was pretty bad.   Our server was not enthusiastic, especially when we ordered our saganaki.  My lamb souvlaki order was royally screwed up. They came back with an well done beef souvlaki.  The manager initially offered me a free dessert.  I didn't even get my food yet and you're offering me a free dessert?  Then he came back and said he would comp my dinner.  I could have easily left after C finished her dinner.  I was just totally disappointed with the experience and will never visit here again."}
{"text":"I thought this place might be good since my wife recommended it, but I was wrong. We arrived around dinner time and it was really full.  We were seated quickly enough, but those were all the good impressions I had from there. There was a large noisy group on two tables away from us, plus a family with a really loud baby. It was so noisy I felt like I just want to eat my food and get out of there.   Service was quick, but hardly polite since it was so busy. They were rushing around and unless you ask somebody nobody's going to ask if you're ok with your food.  Food was okay, but the overall experience was enough to make me not go there again."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM AMAZINGGG TAZIKI SAUCE! It's so thick and garlicky! *DROOL*  Also you must try the fried cheese that comes on the sizzling platter and the pork souvlaki. I come here all the time for lunch. They also have a nice patio for these upcoming summer days!"}
{"text":"I usually order take out from here. When I go pick it up the interior is nice and very spacious. They also have a huge covered patio. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. The food is good, but also not great. The rice a little too saucy and the Greek salad is soggy with dressing. It'll do in a pinch when I'm really craving a souvlaki dinner, but the search is still active for the perfect souvlaki place."}
{"text":"The waiter (Panagiotis, K.) was lackluster to say the least.  Our beverage glasses were frequently empty and he seemed to forget we asked for refills until he walked by our table and we were staring at him in an attempt to make eye contact.  He didn't respond to the normal, \"Excuse me.\"  The 45+ minute wait for our food (when the restaurant was no where near capacity) was absolutely RIDICULOUS!  The waiter offered no explanation.  When the food finally arrived my salmon & shrimp were subpar to say the least.  The quality of the salmon was so poor I literally questioned whether or not it was salmon.  I was told it was the only fish they served.  There was nothing flavorful about this meal.    On a better note, my son ordered the large lamb souvlaki dinner and LOVED it!  He says the lamb was tender and juicy.    Should you have no other options but to dine at the Shish Kebob House order anything BUT the salmon & shrimp plate."}
{"text":"We keep coming back for the beautiful patio, but the overall dining experience is a hearty \"meh.\" On our last outing, we both had the chicken souvlaki special ($28) which came with 3 shrimp, rice, potatoes, greek salad and a 7oz pint of krombacher. The salad was very cheesy, but there was only one slice of tomato and one olive for the whole plate. The souvlaki was good, despite that we both experienced a square that was mostly gristle, but the biggest disappointment was the shrimp. I was expecting grilled shrimp, but instead we got breaded butterflied pre-made shrimp. Historically the service has been hit and miss, as when its busy we're often left unattended and have to flag servers down if we need anything."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst Greek food I ever ate.  I came to Astoria because the Bay Area is poorly served by its own Greek restaurants (there is 1 great restaurant, a couple decent Greek restaurants, and several bad ones).  Astoria does not rise to the level of bad.  We quickly received seats and ordered drinks.  Since I drove, I ordered iced tea.  It came out of the fountain:  they did not make it themselves.  A tick against Astoria right from the start.    We ordered the hummus.  It arrived chunky style, as though they thought they might be making salsa instead.  I ordered the pork souvlaki, one of the dishes they claim fame with.  My order came with a \"fresh Greek salad.\"  The \"fresh Greek salad,\" Astoria version, has brown lettuce, 2 tomato quarters, 1 olive, some sort of oil, and crumbled, tasteless feta cheese.  My entree arrived:  six hunks of pork, \"roasted potatoes,\" and \"savory rice.\"  The potatoes had not seen an oven for roasting in a very long time:  they, in fact, had been boiled and perhaps microwaved to throw the chill off.  The rice tasted like it came from a box, and may have been mostly cardboard anyway.  The pork resisted knife and fork:  dry, tough, hardly any taste despite claims to marination.    I've enjoyed excellent Greek food in Greece, Detroit, Chicago, and at the homes of Greek friends.  What Astoria calls Greek food is about as close to Greek food as Toronto is to Athens."}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price is my tag line for this place.  The portions are generous and the service was friendly.  It seems like this place has been around for a while and you know what you are getting in this family style-ish restaurant.  This won't be the best Greek meal you'll ever have though.  I think it hits the spot but this place seems to be more about the quantity and deriving flavor with lots of cheese & oil as opposed to using the best or fanciest ingredients on the market.  The wine and beer list is also quite limiting.  So just enjoy it for what it is."}
{"text":"Another one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, and yet another one that I plan on frequenting as of next week.  Located in the heart of Greek Town, yes, right on the Danforth, Astoria is easy to get to whether you're taking the subway or driving.  They have the most beautiful patio, surrounded by greenery and a white stone wall. And the food....ohhhh, the food! My absolute favourite thing to order here is the vegetable souvlaki. The vegetables are grilled to perfection and served on a delicious bed of rice with a dollop of the most delicious tzatziki I have ever had.  The family that runs this place is friendly, honest and most welcoming, and the food and ambiance will keep me coming back for the rest of my days.  If you need me, I'll be over here dreaming about Astoria. Don't wake me unless you *Absolutely* have to."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????Cester?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a good friend so I have to check it out.  Nice place, friendly staff.   Ordered the calamari for an appetizer however for $13 and the amount of calamari you get is not worth it, plus they were frozen (you can tell) and a bit chewy.  Averagly good but not worth it.   I got the chicken souvlaki dinner, and it was very tasty. The meat was fresh and tender, the salad was fresh, I had no complaints. Also seing other dishes there, it looked excellent. Go with the regular chicken dinner, the amount of food you get it more than enough.   The highlight of the place is the delicious tzatziki sauce, fresh and very garlicky! !!"}
{"text":"Big thanks to one of my fave local Newmarket Elites who noticed I had uploaded some sweet pics of this location and actually never put together a review to tell the tale of my experience.   I grew up going for Greek dinner at the Astoria down on Toronto's Danforth Ave. The smell, the food, the atmosphere, all wonderful memories of family dinners and good times.  I was researching Greek food in the GTA when I discovered that my families fave spot had opened new locations closer to home - Opa! It was a while before I could visit the Newmarket/Aurora location but when I did I was pretty pleased overall.  The lamb was exactly as I had remembered it, the saganaki, calamari and of course the greek salad and potatoes had not lost one bit of their flavour in their travels into the burbs. The decor was more beautiful and more modern than its parent location, however given that it is located in such a remote area of York Region I found the atmosphere to be lacking. Staff wore standard polo shirts and weren't traditionally Greek and jolly with slight accents. Not that this last part was a big deal but when everything else is going well, you notice small differences.  Overall, this is a much more convenient way for GTA's food fanatics to get their fix of fine Greek fare without having to travel and fight for parking on Toronto's busy Danforth.  Will be back again, hungry.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"First time at Astoria at Rutherford.  Beautifully decorated and the food is amazing.  Ordered the beef souvlaki and it was cooked to perfection. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Surprisingly not very busy for a Saturday evening.  Walked in no wait while all other places in the area were jammed.  Kind of had me worried.  Like I said,  the food was good and came quick but the presentation left a lot to be desired and they took forever to clear dirty plates."}
{"text":"I've been to Astoria maybe five or six times, their food always tastes great.  I usually get their large lamb souvlaki, small lamb souvlaki, or sometimes during lunch I'll mix it up a bit and get lamb on a pita.  I've tried their chicken and pork souvlakis too, and they were good, but not as good as the lamb."}
{"text":"They got me hooked by catering to my work one day, and now I go back every month.  I usually order the lamb on a pita or lamb souvlaki (medium), and it's been great maybe 19 times out of 20. Just one time it was a little over cooked and the meat had some mysterious veiny chewy pieces to it which made it less enjoyable.  It's funny that this Astoria location has a lower rating than the one on the Danforth, I went here first and would rate it a ten out of ten. But the Danforth location is just a little bit better, so I'd have to rate that one an eleven."}
{"text":"I used to eat here when I was a kid, so I've witnessed the evolution of Astoria over the years.   Unfortunately, it's been more of a devolution.   They've officially sold out. The meat is absolutely horrendous and smells awful. Everything just tastes like it was made on an assembly line. I really wish I could write a good review about this place because I basically grew up in here.. Only giving it 2 stars because of its sentimental value."}
{"text":"I usually come here for dinner as it is my favourite Greek restaurant to eat at on the Danforth.  The service is quite good and there isn't usually a long line up to deal with as the restaurant is fairly large and can fit quite a few people inside.  Most of the food is great and I usually order the pork or lamb souvlaki plate in large.  The small plate is actually not that much smaller so you can always order that and still be quite full.  The meat is always nicely cooked to perfection and if you have any issues they are quick to fix it.  They also give you a generous portion of Greek salad along with your choice of sides with your order.  I usually go with the rice and potatoes and that leaves me nicely stuffed by the end.  I believe their portions are the largest out of any of the Greek restaurants in the GTA area and it keeps ne coming back for more.  I'll definitely drop by again if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday for a late lunch.  They sat us (a couple) next to a bunch of tables with screaming children - if you have a designated host, they should know better how to seat a room, and know we wouldn't have wanted to sit there.  After five or six minutes of sitting amongst the screaming without any acknowledgement or greeting from a server, we got up and left -- the host on the way out, \"Have a great day, thanks for coming!\" without any obvious observation that we'd actually just been sat by him."}
{"text":"If you're into home made Tzatziki sauce and generous portions, you would enjoy Astoria.  The restaurant is quite big - family style full of many tables and booths. We ordered two grilled calamari dinners and one pork souvlaki dinner. Each meal came with a large Greek salad. But I didn't like how the tomatoes were cut in extremely large halves and the lettuce was a bit brown.   I found the pork souvlaki to be extremely tough, even though it was recommended and the \"specialty\" of the restaurant. Grilled calamari wasn't all that impressive either. With each dinner, you also receive two sides (potatoes, rice, fries, veggies). My vegetables were overly salted and bathed in butter. The meal was satisfactory, we were full with lots of left overs.  Our waiter did a great job, meals came out fast, always refilled water glasses.  If it wasn't for the location of meeting West end friends, I'd probably just stick to somewhere on the Danforth."}
{"text":"The best Greek food you can get in Mississauga!  The beef, chicken, lamb and pork souvlaki is so good.  When you order the beef they ask you how you wanted cooked which is a big bonus.  The sides such as the salad, rice and potato is always fresh.  I think what keeps me coming back is that tzatziki.  So creamy and garlicky.  They also have a nice patio.  The parent restaurant is on the Danforth and have been there for over 40 years so they must know what their doing."}
{"text":"I'm baaack! And STILL loving the best pork souvlaki on a bun in the neigbourhood!  The Greek salad is simple but delicious, the calamari, especially the grilled calamari is solid as well, and the baklava is surprisingly good especially with a cup of their excellent fresh-brewed coffee.  But the Superstar here is really the \"Pork Souvlaki on a Bun\" with tomatoes, onions, and lots of their signature tzatziki sauce, thick as peanut butter, and perfectly delivering the delicious garlicky punch.  Skip the pedestrian pita bread, get the pork souvlaki plate dinner or the pork souvlaki on a grilled garlic bun, and you can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time last night with my mother and our friend. It was very nice. The prices were a bit high, but it was still very nice. The tzatziki sauce was to die for. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the food. I feel bad giving this restaurant a bad review as the service was really great. The pork souvlaki was spiced with an odd combination of cinnamon and/or nutmeg? (Not 100% sure what the spices were) but it left me and my lunch partner with the worst kind of indigestion. :( too bad..  Still on the lookout for a good Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"There is not a single place all across Canada, or all across Greece for that matter, that makes a better Tzatziki than this place.   It is just out of this world.  Very garlic heavy.  I order an appetizer order of of tzatziki with my food everytime. Mix it into the rice and potatoes and smear it on the meat.  Chicken or pork souvlaki are especially good with it."}
{"text":"I was here years ago and, like many other yelpers, remember this being much better.   The server was friendly but forgetful and inattentive. He didn't bring us cutlery or side plates with our pita and dip appetizer, and we didn't get our drinks until halfway through the meal!  We had:  The three dip appetizer to start. Humus, tzatziki, taramasalata with warm pita -all delish.   Greek salad - I ordered extra olives and to my dismay there were only 4 olives on my salad :( Other wise it was good. A bit heavy on the feta for my taste.  The lamb souvlaki  - Disappointing. The lamb was cooked nicely but severely under seasoned. It didn't taste like souvlaki at all. It tasted like plain, grilled lamb. BOO :(  For desert we ordered the baklava. I don't care for this dish so I can't really comment on if it was good or not. it was too nutty for my taste.    It's a shame because everything looked so good. I don't know if I will return."}
{"text":"Nothing puts me in a bad mood like reading good reviews of a new place outside and going in and wondering if people have had ever had good food in their life to compare.  We went for a late lunch and if you want my advice - $12.50 for calamari rings that they pour out a bag - I know this because no tentacles - is ridiculous.  Add to that they were as chewy as hell.  For garbage like that I shouldn't have paid more than $6 but I would've preferred not to have been served that crap at all.  The souvlaki was good - I wish I would've just ordered that. But me, my wife and son ordered the cheapest things on the menu - the souvlaki sandwiches - which were impossible to eat because they fell apart in your hands - and the bill still came out to $62??  With the calamari and 3 pops it came out to that.   Whoever said that the tzatziki sauce was good probably think Cheez Wiz is gourmet.  Had the consistency of mud on a cold day.   Whoever said this place was well priced must've never ate out in their life.   The only good thing about eating there was knowing at least I didn't go there for dinner and now I know never to go there again.   If South St Burger didn't close down I wouldn't even have been desperate enough to try it."}
{"text":"It is quite interesting, as this location has the almost exact same name as another restaurant, just down the street!  The food here was pretty good! We shared a platter with lots of different starters, and had 2 dips with it. The hummus was amazing, and the caviar dip was great as well.  For my meal, I got the Lamb Souvlaki. It cane with a giant Greek salad, which was done very well. The dressing could have been a little heavier in my opinion. The lamb was a little overcooked for my particular liking, but the flavour was amazing.   The service was really good. Everyone in the restaurant moved very quickly. They seemed to give out salads to the wrong tables, but quickly made up for it without us really figuring out.   A great spot overall if you're in the mood for some Greek!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. This restaurant is a disgrace to the Greek neighbourhood. The souvlaki dinners at our table (party of 4) were slopped on the plate and were missing rice!   I ordered a shrimp salad for ~$18 and was expecting grilled prawns or decent sized shrimp and was served a bland iceberg Greek salad with (possibly canned) or brined, acidic olives and small cocktail shrimp thrown on top. No flavour, no presentation, no value. Disgraceful! At least grill the shrimp and serve them on a skewer with possibly some warm olives or something to get excited about. Pathetic. Our server was not at all personable and barely came to our table."}
{"text":"Hands down terrible restaurant.  I've been to many of the Greek restaurants on the Danforth and this was by far the worst.  Apparently, this restaurant was the one to be at back in the day, but since changing into a franchise it has gone terribly down hill. Service- Was there on a Friday night, not busy, but after browsing the menu and waiting for another guest to arrive (5min literally) we were asked \"Are you going to order or what?\"  That should have been the first red flag! Food- Bottom of the barrel salad.  I ordered a salad that was lucky if I saw any green- it was all core- I should have sent it back! Each one of us (table of 5) got one black olive and two chucks of tomato...really? I paid $18 for a 9oz glass of wine and the worst salad ever.  Apparently, the pork was dry as a bone and the potato had a tomato type sauce.  Grilled chicken kabob was good. One of us were sick after and all five of us dissapointed. Will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"Grilled calamari.  Yum.  It's something that I sometimes actually dream about.  Succulent, flavourful, delicious.  I love it as a dinner meal with rice potatoes and salad and as a stand alone lunch on top of their Greek Salad.  I recently took visiting relatives here for lunch during a weekday so it was empty of the usual busy weekend dinnertime crowd.  We also order the pork souvlaki as well as the chicken souvlaki.  Both were delicious, but the soft, juicy pork was a definite standout!  It was a bit more charred on the outside that we would have liked but the inside elicited 'ooohs' of yumminess by my worldly relatives.  The saganaki (flaming goat cheese!) served on various breads was an interesting sight, salty and simply ok.  It's something to order with the relatives, but not something I would recommend otherwise.  The service was decent and the atmosphere fun for the occasion.  Order the grilled calamari!!"}
{"text":"Pork souvlaki was not cooked through and was just gristle and fat. Second time was cooked correctly but still gristle and fat. They took it off the bill with lots of apologies but still would never return there."}
{"text":"When the place first opened I was really happy with the food and happy there was an alternative to Mr. Greek. But over the last little while, I find they are giving smaller and smaller portions (except for their salad that is 98% iceberg lettuce, some onions, crumbled feta and 1 olive) and the prices are getting higher. It is OK but with other Greek restaurants opening in the area, I will likely be taking my business elsewhere...which is really too bad!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I've been going for years. The Saganaki is my favourite thing, today I arrived in hopes to capture the Saganaki being served so that I could refer friends that I told earlier about Astoria, but when I asked my server to give me 5 seconds to get ready for it she completely ignored us and just quickly set it aflame and turned my Saganaki into a SADanaki. This server has always been cold to us but I never minded, but this was unacceptable, I can't wholeheartedly recommend Astoria anymore, that's just rude. Food is great though.   TLDR: Dark haired server with glasses blatantly ignored our request to capture the Saganaki."}
{"text":"Great Greek restaurant!  The portions are huge and the taste doesn't disappoint!  I love the chicken souvlaki dinner, it's what I always get!  It is served with a delicious Greek salad to start and comes with your choice of 2 sides - I always get the rice and potatoes and along with the garlicky taziki, it's a great meal and very filling for a reasonable price.  The staff and decor are also great... Very nice family restaurant and they do take out :)"}
{"text":"Love this place been going off and on for 8 years. I don't even live in Toronto anymore but when I come to visit I make sure to come and get my Astoria fix!!   Chicken Slovaki is unmatched anywhere. Huge chunks and so tasty with taziki."}
{"text":"Back in the day, Astoria was one of the best places to get Greek food on the Danforth, but now, it's been lacking in some key areas. The food used to taste much better and cost much less, but that's all changed now.   The other day, I went to Astoria for the first time in years. I remember when the portions used to be rather large (not that they aren't now, but they used to be much larger) for a fraction of the cost of what it is now. You also don't get free bread anymore- not that I need anymore carbs after rice AND potatoes, but I eat them anyways.  Aside from that, the food still tastes good, but not as good as before. I had the calamari dinner like I usually do and it was much oilier than I remembered. I think they just didn't let it sit for long enough when they took it out of the deep fryer, but I can do without the pool of oil at the bottom of my plate. I tried a bit of the grilled calamari as well and I wish I ordered that instead.  As for service, it's always been pretty good here. The servers are super nice and they remember you... even if you haven't been back for 10 years.They bring your food out in no time and if you want a quick meal that tastes good, you might as well go to Astoria."}
{"text":"Spontaneously came to the danforth in the search for some good old Greek food. Stumbled into Astoria and with the place looking quite inviting decided to give it a try. We ordered the fried calamari, chicken souvlaki dinner and grilled shrimp dinner. The service was really good and our server was very friendly. However, in regards to the food I would say it's good but nothing special. The fried calamari was crispy but felt like they were a little overcooked. The chicken and shrimp dinners were decent and come with the usual rice, potatoes and salad. They weren't as flavorful as I had hoped. Worth a try, the place is very nice inside."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal - authentic food with Greek waiters to boot. Portions are plentiful and the food was quite satisfying.   We ordered the saganaki, fried calamari, and souvlaki dinner. I'm not a huge fan of saganaki as it is - I find it far too salty - and this one was nothing special for me. Calamari was good, good texture and paired nicely with the uber-garlicky tzatziki. I enjoyed my souvlaki dinner, chicken was moist, potatoes tender, and rice flavorful. The massive Greek salad we got to start was decent as well. I have to say that my dad's pork souvlaki was burnt, so I'm taking away a star for that.   Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We never felt rushed, and everything came out in good time. Atmosphere is alright, fireplace inside was a nice touch.   Prices are reasonable - $18 for a huge souvlaki dinner with 2 sides and a Greek salad. Overall, pretty good, especially considering the neighborhood it's in.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Starving after a long day in the ER when my sister suggested we come to this place as they have very decent portions. Service was great and fast! Within 5 minutes after our order we got our Greek salads (come with their entrees). My sister ordered the small pork and almost couldn't finish them. I ordered the beef! And dad had the lamb! Large entrees are better for value but the small is almost just as much food. Everything was cooked to perfection. Lamb was very tender! I will be ordering that next time. Sides are delicious as well! We were so stuffed we didn't get to see if they have any baklava or not!  Overall a v.good dining experience !"}
{"text":"Well done, well done  We need more restaurants like this. Chef is extremely professional . Very very very clean place.   Food is delicious ..no surprises..we had the Beef souvlaki and several orders of sauteed shrimp !!!   We will definitely come back to try more stuff !!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service.  Prompt and polite.  We ordered wine, water, calamari, and saganaki.  Water and wine served immediately. Hors d'overs  very shortly afterwards.  Delicious.  Waiter kept checking with us despite being very busy.  Lamb was delicious.  Everyone of our party of 7 was pleased with the service and food."}
{"text":"Have had way better Greek food on the Danforth. Very pricey and quality is not there. I ordered a chicken souvlaki wrap. It was all wrap and no chicken (ratio was off).  Would not go back."}
{"text":"I loved this place for years before this location opened. This location has solid food, you know what you'll get every time. The Greek salad is unbelievably good! This is the first time ever they didn't screw up an order. The service lacks at times, they never refilled our water glasses once during the meal."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location on the Danforth years ago but since they opened up this restaurant in Mississauga I've only been going to this location now.  It's much closer and the parking is easier and it has basically the same quality food as the Danforth.  One thing I have noticed through out the years is that is seems as if their portions are getting smaller and smaller.  I'm not necessarily talking about the meat because for things such as the souvlaki platters you're ordering small or large etc but all the sides that come with such as rice, potatoes or fries etc.  The plates looks less \"full\" than they used to it seems.  There just seems to be more space on the plate than before...  The salads that come first are still fantastic.  The particular feta they use for the salads is not your typical grocery store feta.  This cheese is much more tasty and is almost \"pellet\" shaped.  The tzatziki sauce is really really good too but I think they don't give enough of it.  If we order an appetizer place like hummous and tzatziki I usually keep the extra tzatziki for my meal.  I think (not sure) but I think they actually charge if you want more tzatziki on the side with your meat dish.  One of the great things about this place is that they do take reservations and they will do large parties like 20+.  I've been here numerous times with a party of 20+ and although you will be in the back side room adjacent to the patio because that's the only place that can hold 20+ it will become noisy there considering you're pretty tightly packed and you're in an enclosed area.  I've only eaten outside once but it's nice if you can get a spot outside.  There aren't that many tables outside in comparison.    Going to the restroom is kind of weird because it almost seems like you are walking through the kitchen to get there.  It's not the kitchen but where all the servers pick up the food.  You also have to go to this area if you're paying by credit card as well.  Overall the food is very good.  The portions are still decent although I think they have shrunk a bit compared to say 10 years ago and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"- Portions for items are huge (leftovers for days) - The restaurant is SO spacious & accomodating - You can park your car or bike on the street nearby or Chester Subway Station is literal steps away  - Flavour/food itself was satisfactory, the meats were a bit chewy (could use some tenderizer or slow roasting tbh). I don't eat Greek food too often nor am I a food snob when it comes to it, so I liked my meal just fine aside from the meat (pork souvlaki), all's well - Came here during Taste of Danforth (Sun), my friend who lived in the area recommended it  - The waiter was a friendly young man who patiently answered our questions; orders came in a timely fashion - good service, I would say  - Noise level: average - Ambience/dress code: casual  Wouldn't necessarily come here again but it was a good stop and I enjoyed my time :)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, tender beef and customer service was awesome. Big portion for a large size and remind me of sa forth location"}
{"text":"My parents have been going to this place for 30 years. I've been going my entire life... and I've only ever ordered one thing. Pork souvlaki platter with potatoes and rice. UNBELIEVABLE meat and the tzatziki is the best I've ever had. It's gone downhill a little lately, it's more of an institution than it used to be but still serves up the best souvlaki."}
{"text":"This is the third Astoria I've been to and I remember way back when there was only one.  The original Astoria on the Danforth near Chester Ave was the one and only and the original used to be a hard place to get into because it was always so busy.    Just as how Astoria has expanded out to Mississauga on Dundas east (the location I've been to the most) as well as Newmarket, this Vaughan location that has been around for a while has a sign as if they just opened.  As it was my first time actually entering the doors of this place it wasn't the first time I've had food from here as my in laws have had take out/catering before from this Astoria location.  This \"new\" Astoria location located across the street from Vaughan Mills on the north side of Rutherford is a busy place.  The mall is busy, the restaurant is busy, the street is busy and the entire area is a buzz.  This location seems to be well loved and while the name is familiar for those that know the old Danforth this new place doesn't necessarily have the same charm as it's just too \"new\".    Now that I've been to 3 of the 4 existing locations, this being the third of three I can say that things have certainly changed when comparing Astoria to Astoria that is this is a location apples to apples comparison.  To me the original will always be the original.  Although I'm not in that area as often as I used to be (the Danforth), my wife is in the area daily.  She tells me how the place is much emptier than it used to be.  The Mississauga location my wife had gone there late last year and was not as impressed as previous visits as she told me the servings seemed smaller and smaller with each visit.    Now while I haven't gone to Astoria in a while I will take her word for it that being that she'd always get a large souvlaki order eat what she could and bring home the rest.  The bringing home of the leftovers has shrunk because overall the plates have become smaller as do the portion sizes.    While nothing can compare with the serving sizes of say 15 years ago at the original Danforth location the serving sizes for somebody like me who has been going to Astoria for decades would know and these days the prices are understandingly higher but the servings have definitely become smaller.    It's all the little things and they all add up.  The large lamb souvlaki \"cubes\" in which the order had 6 cubes, to me were noticeably smaller.  The rice and fries or potatoes are no longer plated on the opposite sides of the meat which is in the middle of the plate but rather on the same side essentially each taking less than a quarter of the plate.  Instead the tzatziki and ketchup are plated to opposite to the rice/potatoes/fries side.    This plating technique is significant because it now allows for LESS food to be plated on seemingly smaller oval plates that previous which in turns makes for less overall food and portion sizes.  Now while there is no real comparison to a place like Zet's who's serving sizes are arguably the thing of legends, Astoria used to be \"less skimpy\".  My wife spoke of it and now I witnessed it.    Bread which used to be served with the meal is now a la carte unless you order a dip like hummus in which they really don't give you that much.  The side salads that come with souvlaki meals seem to be more of the same and by more I mean less.  Less than previous in that there's a single olive on it and for me what equated to maybe a quarter wedge (3 thin slices) of tomato.  The feta cheese which makes their salad so good didn't have a consistent serving on top of the 3 salads I saw (my mother in laws, my wife's, and mine).    I don't know if Astoria has just slowly adapted to serving the public less and less over time or am I the only one that noticed it?  I mean back in the day the original Astoria's portions were borderline ridiculous.  Ordering chicken would get you 2 full sized center breasts.    While the food is decent at Astoria it certainly for somebody with a memory like mine when it comes to food can basically quantify how it has changed from bread that you have to pay for to portion sizes that are noticeably less generous to salads basically almost all lettuce to less potatoes and rice that used to fill a full sized platter, Astoria is not what it used to be and this new location sadly has made it more than clear.    The service makes up for what to me is a place past its prime even though it's just so packed at this location but if it weren't for a family function I'd not want to necessarily come back for what seems is a place which is a shell of its former self when compared to the original location which to me is the standard by which to measure this establishment as a whole.  Sadly, this is not your father's Astoria on the Danforth."}
{"text":"the food was pretty bland and the meat was tough. the meal was overall satisfactory but not really worth the price."}
{"text":"This place made me a fan of Greek food!  I return to this place about once a month and I love it.  I hardly ever have to wait for a table even on the weekend since the dinning area is so big.  The best is the fried calamari, a must order for me every single time."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant, great food and great service. The food was hot when it came to our table and our server was the best ! The deep fried calamari was a big hit with my daughters. This was my first visit  but it will not be my last."}
{"text":"Love this place. For the best value, go for the lunch menu. Food is something to praise about! On the pricier side but for the most part worth it. Their calamari is something not to miss-grilled and fried are amazing. Wonderful eats that tantalize the palate and leave you wanting so much more..."}
{"text":"The best souvlaki I've ever had, grilled and seasoned to perfection. The tzaziki is the best anywhere! My go to place for Greek on the danforth."}
{"text":"Our go to Greek restaurant for years. Convenient parking and right next to Chester subway station.   Everything is great!"}
{"text":"We have been back a few times. The food is great. The service is good. I will be back again.  The moussaka is great, the souvlaki is very good. Everyone enjoyed there dinner."}
{"text":"Usually quite good but last time the service was slow and the food wasnt as great.  Other times the food was very good, wonderful atmosphere and good service"}
{"text":"I have been to 3 different Astoria locations and I am glad to have this one in Vaughan. Been to this location 3-4 times and I am happy with it.  Everything is pretty fresh and portions are good. The grilled calamari could be more tender, other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and beyond excellent service. Our waiter Alex was exceptional. We had grilled calamari, saganaki, chicken and lamb souvlaki dinners , all was great ! Can't wait to go back.   Salad is soggy which is my only complaint"}
{"text":"Excellent pork souvlaki and calamari. Prices have gone up recently but still love this spot"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a few weeks ago with a friend. I was excited to try moussaka in an actual Greek restaurant. It was disappointment and I'd say I like the one from Mr. Souvlaki down the street much more. My friend's food didn't seem that great either and service was just okay. I'd give this place one more chance just to try their chicken souvlaki."}
{"text":"The food is as good as anywhere else on the Danforth and they are not very accommodating, treat customers with attitude rather than gratitude for eating at their dime a dozen restaurant."}
{"text":"This town is turning into piss and shit with all the franchising of restaurants. I got duped into thinking that this was a corporately run extension of the original on Danforth.... Not even close. Nothing was up to par and it was way too expensive.. Dinner for 3, no drinks $95!! Calamari tough, lamb and chicken souvlaki no flavour... Frozen shrimp and fries. I'll never go back, and for punishment I won't even go back to the idiots on Danforth who felt the need for greed over keeping the quality of what was a Toronto institution.. Are there really that many desperate franchisees that want to cut corners and drive a business into the ground?  Complete joke."}
{"text":"I have to agree with recent reviewers...  Service is a hit or miss...waiter can by to ask for drinks and before we could answer, he disappeared for 10 min.  Then it was 10 to 15 min before the water and drinks came by.  He forgot one of our appetizers, the meat was over cooked (we asked for medium but got medium/well). Plating looked like it was thrown together in a cafeteria line up.  We were entertaining guest from out of country so this was a bit embarrassing because up to now they have had good experiences with the restaurants /meals in Canada.  Too bad because our cousins really recommend this place and I felt like walking out right after the drink order experience. Walk further down and pick a random greek restaurant and I think you might have a better experience."}
{"text":"Tried the Mississauga location for the first time today and the food was great. Usually we see the long lines at taste of Danforth, so it was nice to sit down and try their food.   We ordered Greek fries and a small entree of chicken souvlaki which comes with a side salad and your choice of 2 -rice, potatoes or fries. They also have the option for a large entree. Honestly the small is more than enough for sharing with an app as well. Their take on Greek fries was really cool. We are used to the ones with just feta on it. Astoria's came with a sauce on it in addition to feta and it was tasty. Chicken was very moist and delicious. The salad was a generous helping, and the rice and potatoes will fill you right up.   Overall the food and environment was really good. Our only knock was that the main entree took awhile to get to us - our fries and salad were almost all eaten before it came! Regardless, would definitely come back for another round of food."}
{"text":"Excellent! I must say what a turn around from our last experience. The food was delicious, fresh to order and quick, even though they had 2 large parties, and quite a few other tables, they paid very close attention to our small 6 people table. My gluten free 'needs' were met, our server 'Peter' was amazing as usual, professional and easy going, very sweet person. Our portions we're very generous! Even took lots to go. The place is very clean, very well maintained. And with Lots of parking.  And the high lite of my night; celebrity spotting! Yes right here at our local Astoria! What a treat!!!!  Was honour to meat Mr Marc Anthony! Celebrity stylist!!!"}
{"text":"Opa!  The saganaki is always great; we usually start with this.  I have personally enjoyed the \"small\" beef souvlaki and pork souvlaki dinners. Why \"small\"?  Because the regular sized dinners are far more than I could ever consume in one sitting. Pricing is good.  The \"dinner\" includes a really good Greek salad, piled high on the plate with generous olives and cheese.  The potatoes are flavourful but not greasy, and the meat is always cooked to perfection. We have also visited the location in Newmarket, but there is something to be said for the Danforth.   This place is always busy.  If you come after 6 p.m. you will likely have to wait in line. A must visit restaurant on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"Feeling Greek tonight and came across this place. It was pretty packed and the atmosphere inside is really lively. The food is definitely a little pricey, but quality is good and portions are huge (a single dinner can probably good for two people). Service is not bad and food came out pretty fast. Overall, an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! Definitely one of the highlights during my trip to Toronto. My friend recommended the souvlaki, so we each got a different type. I shared the large lamb souvlaki with the boyfriend and the portioning was perfect- we left full and happy! The meat was juicy and tender and perfectly cooked (with just the right amount of burnt spots!) We got ours with a very healthy helping of potatoes and rice, but they have other sides as well, like fries or mixed veggies. Also came with a huge salad! Astoria is a safe bet if you have guests or want a nice dinner with family (there were a lot of families dining there when I went). Fair price, great portions, fantastic service- what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner of chicken souvlaki with salad potatoes and rice. Prime dinner time and this chicken was dry as a bone. Tzaziki was without cucumber and pasty. Service was slow and inattentive. Have been to the Danforth and that's still the way to go because they have to serve you a decent meal or they would be out of business there. Salad was overdressed and soggy. The rest of our party of eight were not impressed either.  Spend your Money elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"They did a great job accommodating a large, tricky party (10 adults, 5 babies) on short notice; the food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"There is only one word that describes every aspect of my visit to Astoria - disappointed.  After a much anticipated warm day, the parental unit and I decided to go on the Danforth for dinner. I had drinks with co-workers here so I wanted to check out this establishment, not knowing what their meals were like.   Granted it was a Friday night, the place was packed. As we did not have a reservation, we waited for about ten minutes before being seated. Our server came instantly, which I thought would be reflective of amazing service to come. After 15 minutes, our drinks came. By this time, we had all decided what to order. Luckily I was there with my family so the 30 minute (a good half hour) wait for our food didn't seem that bad, in spite of our stomachs growling. If I was on an awkward first date, on the other hand, it would have become even more awkward!   We ordered the chicken souvlaki on a pita and the pork souvlaki large dinner.  * The meat was dry and tasteless, it was obvi overcooked.  * The potatoes were undercooked with absolutely no flavor.  * The rice was hard and bland.  This establishment is relying solely on its reputation. Unless you have some sort of debt to Astoria, use your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Super huge portions, you could probably share with a friend. I ordered the dinner combo with pork and deep fried shrimp with a side of potatoes, Greek salad and rice. The salad itself was huge- enough as a meal. My friend ordered the dinner combo as well but the calamari and shrimp. I loved the calamari- it was baked just right and probably one of the best calamari I have every had. The customer service I found was okay, no one really came by to check up on the food or poured us water until the end of the meal. I also found the pricing to be a tad bit expensive for the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Not very impressed at all, I yelped before we went and warned my party we should probably just go to the danforth one but this one is in walking distance  Appetizers took too long but were good, the menu was nice and small which is ideal for kitchen turnaround but not always as fun for patrons  Food was decent, waiter was good, would never return or recommend to anyone though just too blah to even remember after this review"}
{"text":"Being from Queens, NY I found being in this restaurant surreal. The atmosphere is pretty cool and it's well designed. The food was not the best Greek I've ever had but certainly not the worst. It's not a bad feed. I'm used to a slightly different style so I can't criticize too much.   Two things I would change are: 1) the waiters are a bit short (rude) with the customers. They were very impatient and hard to get a hold of. You certainly are not made to feel welcome. I know Greek waiters are known for that but even by NY standards this was not cool. 2) the bar is very VERY limited. If you want to drink Greek beer or your standard well drinks you won't be bothered by this but if you like a more sophisticated drink you will be disappointed.   I'd probably give this place another shot but there are several others I'd try sooner."}
{"text":"This is a huge restaurant; it has 2 separate patios and a ton of indoor seating. I've come here on many separate occasions in the past, and while it hasn't disappointed me, I can't say I've ever been wow-ed. I had the small pork souvlaki dinner with rice and roasted potatoes ($14.95). The portion sizes are good and the tzatziki is super garlicky (I do love garlic). The potatoes they gave me (3) were also huge!! So, I left very full (and feeling like I undid my workout just before)."}
{"text":"I've been to Astoria a few times now and it is a great place to get Greek food! I haven't found many places that I like but this place always provides me with awesome juicy chicken Souvlaki! This place is right next to where I work so it's really easy for me to go in and grab a lunch to go!   The atmosphere is great on the inside, my family and I had an excellent experience here when we came, the service was friendly and the food was delicious, will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The best Food ever!!!! Service is excellent, staff is friendly, place is always clean and portions are worth every penny."}
{"text":"We went to Astoria on Dundas in Mississauga for my husband's birthday so it was his preference.  I, being Greek, knew better, but whatever.  The taramasalata was delicious and alongside warm pita bread, we quickly ate it up.  However, once we got to the main course, that was a different story.  My husband ordered the Lamb Souvlaki dinner, I order deep fried calamari and my daughter ordered the Moussaka.  My husband was happy with his meal but I found the calamari VERY tough and my daughter's very heavy moussaka came with a huge mound of rice.  Way to lower your standards.    When it was time for dessert, they didn't even have any options for and kind of Greek dessert.  No galaktobouriko, no loukoumathes.  Just a little Baklava and cheesecake.  I have found with Greek restuarants, that thereis no pride in cuisine.  They just want you to leave full.  That's all that seems to matter.  I will choose another restaurant next time and it certainly WON'T be Greek food."}
{"text":"This is hands-down our favourite Greek restaurant in the GTA. We have visited both the Danforth and Mississauga locations over the years and were pleased when they opened their location in our new hometown of Newmarket. We have dined in and ordered take-out many times since they've opened. Service is always great. I have met and spoken with the owner many times and he's always pleasant and helpful. Our favourite is the chicken souvlaki although we do get the beef or pork on occasion. Their french fries are really good, especially if you have them freshly cooked when you dine in. The salad is always filling. The hummus is one of my favourites anywhere: lots of garlic and lemon - it's so tasty! Of course, you must try the baklava for dessert (the last time we were there, we tried their new offering, carrot cake, one of our favourites, and it was also really, really good)."}
{"text":"I have been going to Astoria for about 30 years. It was the 'go to ' Greek restaurant when we were on the Danforth or were in the mood for Greek food. My kids loved the saganaki experience. I went recently and what a disappointment. The prices went way up, portion sizes shrunk and quality isn't as good. My big complaint is the seafood dishes are over $20 and don't include the salad. Given the cost,  we all agreed we would not be going back. I think we'll try pantheon next time."}
{"text":"Damn, this place is terrible.   It looks nice, and the service is great, but the food was just awful.   Had chicken souvlaki, with a Greek salad. The souvlaki was tasteless, and the salad had too much dressing on it, giving me heartburn.   Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Food isn't great. It wasn't horrible but I would not return. Prices are high for the quality and service is nothing special"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and is complemented by equal service. A regular for me. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If this restaurants aim is to ward off the worlds vampires with their over abundance of garlic, then mission accomplished.   This evenings visit was a first and last, best described as simply disappointing. Baked from frozen Spanakopita, Tsatiki with more garlic known to humankind and the smallest Dolmades ever.  Overall the food was bland.....the final straw was no doubt a sign I should have made note of, a Greek restaurant that doesn't have Gyros!"}
{"text":"I don't typically give scathing reviews but this place deserves it. We show up ready for a good meal. The front greeter assumed we were part of some party so she ignored us while helping everyone else. Once we made it clear we were not part of a party she didn't even apologize but just walked away to help the group of four she had set a table for. The older gentleman sat us at a table when we asked for a booth. We over looked that assuming no booths were available. Then we ordered dinner. I ordered the rare beef souvlaki with rice and potatoes. My fiancé had the well medium well beef souvlaki with rice and potatoes. Before the dinners were sent out we received big plates of Greek salad. With lots of yummy feta. The salad would have been lovely except for the Un-washed lettuce that was like chewing on grit the entire plate.  The meals came out and my beef was so over cooked that I was chewing for what seemed like hours to get the meat to digest. My fiancé had his beef so bloody that he was gagging. So we just switched plates as I don't mind really rare meat and he doesn't hate over cooked sacrificed food. The rice was over cooked. They potatoes were flavourless. The tzatziki was awesome. And they kept our water glasses filled. That's about as good as I will give our experience. I hope to never eat at this location ever again."}
{"text":"Fresh. Flavorful. Legit. Reasonable price and friendly service. I enjoyed the grilled calamari salad! Great place to have lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was good.   I have always enjoyed Greek food, and at Astoria there are some great choices on the menue. From a simply cheese to an all out 3 meat plater, which is good by the way. Lamb, Beef, Quail with your choice of sides its a great combinations.  However, something I really HATE is that they take now debit!!! What kind of stone age place do not have debit machines!!!!"}
{"text":"We went as a large family group of 16 after visiting the local Ontario Science Center. They had no problems seating the adults and the children since the space  is apparently larger than it seems.  Our waiter was excellent he not only handled our large table but a mixture of other large and small ones adjacent to ours.   I wish I knew his name since I'd mention it here but we all tipped him extra on top of our mandatory group gratuity of %15.   He and the other staff kept the water glasses topped up, got all the orders correct, and were attentive as we dined.  As for the food we all had a mixture of the chicken, lamb, and pork.    Many other reviews here have noted the pork souvlaki and I can definitely agree with them, it was excellent and probably the best I've had.    I had the lamb and it was good however maybe a bit chewier than I would have wanted it, if I go next time I'll ask for it medium rare since it's very easy to over-cook lamb.     From the doggy bag I just had the chicken for dinner today and it was excellent, very well seasoned.  We also had all the regular side dishes (dips, salads etc) and the kalamari.   They were all good however half the table raved about the Calamari, for my expectations I was expecting something with a lighter fried texture.  Overall it was an excellent family dining experience and will definitely return when it's warmer and the patio is open again."}
{"text":"My favourite place for greek food! The decor is a bit dated and the staff can be hit or miss. It is right by the parking lot and subway station so very easy to get to.  Large restaurant with lots of seating and large tables. The grilled calamari is always soft and not chewy and got that nice charcoal grill taste. The saganaki comes flaming and it your standard fare, however the stopped giving out complimentary bread (not that it is needed anyways) The portions are huge - I always leave really really full and sometimes with leftovers for the next day.   Each meal comes with a greek salad covered in feta cheese. The lamb kebobs and beef kabobs are delicious especially if you are craving something meaty. The pork is also amazing really flavourful and never dry or chewy. All the meats are nice and charred and has that bbq taste you want. Comes with rice and potatoes which are also good (steamed veggies can be substituted for a cost) The tzatziki sauce is also really garlicly (bring gum for after!) but it makes it so good. My go to place and will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not being a connoisseur of Greek food, I enjoyed Astoria's. The salad comes with lots of feta (a must!) and a nice light dressing and all of the meat is tender and juicy.  We also had the flaming cheese, which is just the best. The service was friendly and all of the food came out quickly. What's stopping me from rating Astoria's higher is just that there isn't anything stand-out about it. Though the food is great, it isn't different from any other Greek food and the restaurant has a distinct chain restaurant feel."}
{"text":"This restaurant has almost fallen off a cliff. It was much much better a year ago. They have \"dumbed down\" the menu, and increased their prices. The service is so/so. When ordering shrimps we were told that they brought them frozen and breaded, and that they contained garlic powder in them (one of the dinners in our party does not like garlic).   The \"greek\" specialties are rare, no pasticio, no broad beans, no string beans, no stuffed eggplant.   The service was impeccable a year ago, but is now much less professional.   I think the death spiral for what used to be an institution is well underway. There are plenty of other choices available.  My wife and I like to use the Toronto Discount Coupon Book which you can buy online for about $25.00. It gives you the opportunity to try new restaurant and provides both the dinner and the restaurant with an incentive to save on the one hand and to excel on the other."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:   Expensive, Small Portions, Lousy Service.   Astoria Shish Kebob House is a mediocre Greek Restaurant that opened a location in Vaughan (directly across from Vaughan Mills).  With much anticipation of this new location, we were very excited to try it out and see if it brought some of the Danforth up to the Vaughan area.  The Astoria Vaughan location disappoints from the moment you view the menu.  The prices are very expensive compared to the great Greek restaurants located on the Danforth.  The portions are shockingly small.  I mean, VERY small!   The Greek Good you get at the food court across the street at Vaughan Mills are much larger and tastier than what you get at this location.  If you want to experience Astoria, go to the Danforth Location.  It is 100 times better and they give you double of what you get at the location in Vaughan.  Do not waste your time and money at this feeble copy of a Danforth landmark...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"came here with a party of 8, I had the large chicken souvlaki dinner which came with a Greek salad and I had rice/fries for sides. chicken pieces were big just a bit dry. Rice and fries were pretty good but portions were a bit small for those. Bread/rolls were available for extra cost... overall the food was ok if you're looking for average/decent Greek food and just hanging out with old friends I'd just head to the Friendly Greek same quality, bigger sides, free garlic bread"}
{"text":"This is a meal!  I had the lunch Pork Souvlaki with Greek Salad and rice and potatoes.  I think it was on a plate, although I could not see the plate for all the food spilling over the perimeter.  The pork was very tender an moist--not usual for most souvlaki.  It was not overcooked and just loved being dipped in the garlicy tzatziki sauce.    The generous greek salad was layered with feta cheese, and very fresh.  The potatoes must have been boiled in lemon juice and seasonings to get that much flavour.  I had to plan my attack:  eat the souvlaki first, get a good portion of the salad and devour the potatoes, leaving the rice as the end filler.  I can imagine this place would be great for dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Been going to the original location on the Danforth for like 40 years so I know their food well since I grew up on it. Now Astoria is older and 4 location mini chain but it's still all about the huge souvlaki. The salad and potatoes have always been ho-hum.   Here it's alway been about the meat. I recent visit took to the mix grill with lamb chops, quail and chicken souvlaki. The meal brought back memories of childhood backing the trek to Greek town. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"a SOLID 2.5.  This place had the potential to be a 4 star place if the service was at least average.  went here with a bunch of people and we asked to get separate bills but instead of a polite answer we got a straight up \"no\".  the waiter said we already ordered drinks and it can be separated after the meal.  one of my friends asked \"oh...so it won't be complicated after right?\" the waiter said \"yes\"....well it was very complicated after because each person had to go up and tell him what we had.  He even added something to another friend's bill when he never ordered it.  We even heard the guy swearing at us in Greek...nice buddy nice!  If your food did not taste like heaven you would get a NEGATIVE.  i remember asking if we could order about 5 times before he came around.  The funniest part is that the other waiters were amazing....just this one guy was disappointing at best.  Astoria i do hope you read this because i love your place and believe you have probably one of the best souvlaki's on the Danforth.  My review could have been different if i had another waiter but I hope this will help improve your service...i am not trying to attack you but you i have to be honest if you are to improve."}
{"text":"When you think of Greek and Taste of Danforth, one of the first places that comes to mind is ASTORIA!  Its hard to miss this restaurant since its the only one along this stretch of road that's illuminated in bright Pink and Green lights!!!!!   I've been coming to this place for Years, and its one of the first authentic Greek resturants that I have ever been to.  The interior is clean, and the decor gives you the feeling that you've actually landed in Greece, sky blue ceilings, lighting, and garden-esque decor, I felt like I was at one of Epcot Center's Cultural Pavilions lol!!   Summertime they've got a decent sized patio, and the servers are very personable! Iriana and I came here during the Krino Taste of Danforth based on my ummmm recommendation... so no pressure haha!! For Drinks: Iriana had the Zinfandel, and I tried their Greek house wine.... 6oz For food: we both decided to order their Astoria Appetizer Platter since we wanted to try the food vendors as well.  The platter consisted of Dolmades (stuffed grapvines with rice herbs & spices), Golden Fried Calamari, Spanakopita, humus and tzatziki DIP! Drawbacks!: calamari was overcooked, too much breading, and the spanakopita didn't have enough feta. The pita could have been warmer...  Overall, the appetizer was not the best! however I think we should have had their souvlaki dinner instead. With the street festival occurring, we had people lined up right against the patio so it felt a bit awkward trying to enjoy the outdoor dining experience as people were glaring at you lol..... maybe next time Astoria!!!"}
{"text":"Top quality Greek cuisine along with friendly service. First time at this location, have visited Mississauga and Newmarket. Same excellent service and food. I would definitely recommend lunch or dinner. Easy parking, GPS might be of since its a new location. It's across from the Keg."}
{"text":"Uninspired menu. Just okay. This is not the real Greek experience.   Greek salad with iceberg lettuce...that's not authentic.   Can't ruin saganami. It's always delicious.   Spanakopita was average and not that hot.   The sausage is the same flavour as two other Greek places on the street.  The bread looks purchased from a bakery, as opposed to fresh from their oven.  Busy, though, so..."}
{"text":"It's A-ok. Comfort Greek food. For the most part, the food was good and tasty. My socks weren't blown away.  The calamari, definitely the best of the meal Grilled with olive oil, very tasty. This fish roe spread, I don't understand why restaurants give so little bread for so little spread. I mean it's good they give us more of the main, but if I don't have enough bread for the amount of spread, then it's a waste. Better for me if you offer less, charge less. I guess better for them to give a little more and charge more.  I ate the lamb chops. I was really considering getting the 8oz but instead opted for the 16oz. It definitely does not look like 16oz, but the bone could be deceiving. It was tasty, but at times felt a bit burnt.  The service, he was hard to get a hold of. Always had to track him down or get someone else to get him. Hardly could get enough water.  The place though looks nice, in the back the room has a sky light which I thought was cool.  It's like literally across from Chester station, I got off the subway and it was right there at the corner; major convenient."}
{"text":"The food is quite similar to the Greektown version. The decor though is light years more modern, there is tons of space between tables too. Parking of course is free given its in suburbia.  One thing that was really weird is when we got there, I wasn't sure if we had a reservation so I started listing possible names. She then looked and asked again to which tried to help and she pulled the clipboard in as if I'm trying to steal someone's reservation, just wanted to help. Besides, they had plenty of take given it was an early dinner hour.  Seated, server was nice enough. Food is quite good. Liked the pita and dips, pork souvlaki is delicious. They have a decent car menu as well.  I had the chicken souvlaki and it rates food but I'd say it could be slightly juicier. Overall it was still a good dinner for a decent cost."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Resturant for over 20 yrs. it was my husbands favourite Greek Restuarant on the Danforth. In the last year we have been disappointed every time we ate there. Perhaps ownership has changed and the portions have shrank. When we asked for additional tizziki, we were charged. Asking for replacement of rice with additional salad, we were charged. They no longer serve any bread with the dinners. Will think twice before coming back. There is certainly a choice of restaurants on the Danforth."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a Friday dinner to give this place a second chance.  The saganaki was decent but a little burnt. The garlic bread is made with very low quality buns that don't have a lot of substance, but I don't think it would have mattered much because they were oily and tasteless.  We both started with a Greek salad which was very bland. It tasted like Canola oil and oregano.  I say Canola oil specifically as there was a huge container of it in the kitchen that was visible from the dining room.    I had the chicken souvlaki on a pita and my husband had the chicken souvlaki dinner.  The chicken was overcooked and dry on the outside, but rubbery on the inside.  Didn't have much taste either.  My husband's potatoes looked all hacked up and tasted just \"okay\".  The potatoes were definitely overcooked.  T  I'm not sure why we decided to try this place a second time.  The first time we had the beef which was fatty and low quality.    Overall, bland, poor quality ingredients, overcooked food.  The server was very nice and attentive though.  We won't be back...."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The restaurant itself was very nice and staff very friendly. They did have a kids menu which was great. I had the pork souvlaki dinner which came with Greek salad and I chose the potatoes and vegetables. The salad was awesome. The meat was very tender but had cinnamon as one of the seasonings which I did not enjoy. As for the Tzatziki, it was fantastic! the potatoes and vegetables were very nice as well. The server brought the main dish as we were still eating our salads which was a bit awkward. I would go back if they did not use the cinnamon spice on the meat but not sure if that is possible."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The problem: overpriced.  Way too much for 2 people to have dinner.  Also slow, wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Well I ate here tonight for a family birthday . We had a large group of 30 people there . So they accommodated us with a pre set menu  And had great service m our waiter and waitress were super friendly and helpful which is part of why I rated it 4 stars . The decor was fairly nice nothing overly fancy but nice and atmosphere was good . I assume it was because there was 30 people in our party that my lamb souvlaki was a bit dry maybe sat around a bit till all out food came out . So ill give them a pass on that this time . This place is definitely a good greek -Mediterranean place to bring a date or family for a nice evening out ."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The pork souvlaki is delish, and the tzatziki wasn't uber garlicky.  We had a nice time here.  I like the atmosphere and it's easy to find.  The portions are a fair size.  I can't complain about coming here."}
{"text":"Food is really good and service is great. A bit on the expensive side, but definitely the best Greek restaurant I've dined at.  My only ISSUE with this restaurant is when I order the lamb. Astoria really needs to rest their meat before serving it, because you get great food but it's drenched in a pool of blood because they don't rest their lamb   I've even mentioned this to them, and I still get a plate of blood, a big turn off imo. Really hope the staff are reading this and fix this issue, had it not been for this, I would have given the restaurant 5 stars"}
{"text":"Went to Astoria this past Friday evening for the second time. Enjoyed the first visit on a Sunday evening when it wasn't busy.  The restaurant was about half full and quickly noticed that the volume of sound was quite high due to a party and loud talking tables nearby. The floor and walls are made of hard materials and along with a steel deck ceiling, noise tends to reverberate quite freely in the restaurant. There are few soft surfaces to dampen the sound.  I ordered the grilled calamari dinner that was quite good but my partner wanted a souvlaki combo of pork and chicken. \"Can't do.\" said the waiter, something about mixing the different meats on the plate. Can't believe that, thought I. A small plate of tasteless overcooked meat showed up which the waiter claimed was pork. Another small plate of chicken pieces showed up which was a tad overcooked but eatable. A huge side dish of rice showed up with some bland mystery sauce on it. Presentation was awful And this was a disappointment to my partner. Why they couldn't have put it all on one plate with some nice vegetables is beyond me. Is this restaurant company so huge that there is absolutely no flexibility? I generally find greek restaurants on the Danforth to be very accommodating.  Our waiter seemed extremely busy with two others seemingly looking bored with lack of duties. It took, what seemed forever to get a bill.  The restaurant seems to have a management problem as all the poor performance can be tracked backed to disorganization.   Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly and attentive staff.  Juicy chicken breast kebab. Flavorful pork kebab. Amazing super garlicy Tatziki.   Would definitely come back next time we're craving Greek."}
{"text":"This was my favourite restaurant on the Danforth but unfortunately, it no longer is. The prices have increased and the quality of food has decreased.   Today I ordered their pork souvlaki dinner. The starter salad was too salty to eat and on top of that, the pork was burnt to a crisp.   Other restaurants on the Danforth will charge the same (some even less) and give you far better quality food. I would only go to Astoria as a last resort from here on in."}
{"text":"Recommended by a Greek coworker, this place did not disappoint! The tzatziki was out of this world, very creamy and garlicky, and served with piping hot fresh pita. I ordered the small lamb dinner and my friend, the moussaka. The lamb dinner came with a massive greek salad, served before the main. The main itself came with another side, I'm which I opted for fries. The lamb was deliciously tender, perfectly cooked to a mrdium rare, and the portions were well worth it - I had leftovers, which doesn't happen too often! Fries were also surprisingly good; thick cut with a good crunch in the crust. We opted for dessert too, sharing a chocolate slice and I had a Greek coffee. The coffee was spot on and complimented the moist and rich chocolate. The prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food - I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My pick for some of the best Greek food in Mississauga. I have 2 recommendations: the grilled chicken souvlaki with their very garlicky tzadziki sauce, and their grilled calamari. If you stick to these to courses then I dare to say you can't go wrong. Any odd time someone will tell me they don't care for Astoria I always ask them what they ordered there, and it's always something else. Their Greek salad is terrible though. Who the hell puts raw white onions in their salad? Disgusting.  At least use red onions. And their white vinegar based dressing really needs some work as well."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Total meh!  The only reason to really go here is for the patio. It's large and seems to catch the last of the evening sun during dinner time. I assume this is why it's the most sought after restaurant on the Danforth, it is always packed.  The food is 2-3 star at best. It's a good place to take picky eaters or people who are afraid of \"ethnic\" food.   Astoria only has the most boring \"safe\" Greek food on the menu (souvlaki, anyone?) I heard this place was cheaper than most, but I was horrified to see they are charging the same, if not more, as places like Omonia, Ouzeri and Pan on the Danforth that have truly delicious authentic food. WTF?  The souvlaki meals ranged from $13-$20 depending on meat (pork/chicken = $, lamb/beef = $$). My pork souvlaki was adequate but super plain. The salads here came out with some really sad looking lettuce. Really, how hard is it to serve fresh iceberg lettuce? My guess is the salads are pre-made during the day and the lettuce has lots of time to wilt before hitting someone's dinner table.  The service here is fast and efficient but the servers are quite like robots. Don't stand in their path or they will run you down. We got up to leave and pay at the front, yet our waiter quite rudely yelled us down in front of other patrons. I think he thought we were doing a \"dine and dash\"."}
{"text":"I was in here today November the 7th  we ordered few things I'm surprised how terrible it is the quality it's not there like they used to be the best on the Danforth when some Greek American had purchased the place since he sold it n the knew  guys picked it up its not the same terrible The management should wake up and smell the coffee and  not to get greedy  the most recent operator looks like a lost farmer ....!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised how this guys can operate in this manner nice decor but terrible food  and honestly I've been to all of them I'm very disappointed but again it's Greek food so it's rice and salad n potatoes nothing special I hope they turn it around cause it's just not good"}
{"text":"I struggled a bit for what I wanted to give the Astoria Shish Kebob House and I wish it wasn't so. I made my way here on Sunday night after a show got out down the street. The place is pretty huge and has a ton of seating and a pretty large menu to go with it. It was late when we arrived and I was impressed by how fast the ordering/cooking/eating process went which was super important since I had a 2 hour drive back to Buffalo ahead. We ended up ordering the \"large\" chicken kebob plate which was $24.99 so I was expecting a large meal, which was not really the case. This places version of a \"large\" is what pretty much every kabob place I've ever been to serves as a regular Kebob for anywhere between $10-$15. Don't get me wrong, the chicken, rice, and fries were good, but certainly not worth $25. Overall, I enjoyed the food but I did not enjoy the price that went a long with it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 10 years or so and have sadly noticed a steady decline in both the food and service.  The salad used to be my favourite thing here but last time it literally tasted like just iceberg lettuce, cheese and oil. Most of the waiters are grumpy old greek men without any interpersonal skills, which really doesn't help foster a welcoming, comfortable dining experience.   And they're charging for bread now?  Give me a break...  We used to bring guests and family from out of town here but will probably skip this place from now on -- seems it's past its prime. The patio is still cool though..."}
{"text":"Been here twice with the gf for dinner. Would always order the souvlaki dinner which included a starter salad. Dinner was with rice, potatoes or fries.   Salad always has too much onion. Portions for souvlaki are big and are  value for money. Service is good as well so I give it a solid 3 stars.  No need to go to the danforth for greek food. Mississauga has this or colosus at port credit"}
{"text":"Great food!! I think for sure the food is better than DT location, waiters are much nicer too.  For sure is a good place to eat :)"}
{"text":"Came here to this establishment last Friday at around 4:30pm, the place was relatively empty and only began to fill up an hour or so later. Both me and my girlfriend ordered a pork kebob dinner each along with a side of roasted potatoes, Greek salad and rice with their really, really creamy tzaziki sauce. I would definitely return again for dinner.   Pros: - Service was welcoming and friendly - Food came out really fast, within 5-10 mins of ordering - The kebobs were amazing even though I think it was a tad bit too salty for me  Cons: - Took a long time to bring bill out - Roasted potatoes were not roasted as advertised."}
{"text":"For 25+ years Astoria has been our \"go to\" Greek restaurant but I'm disappointed that over the past 2-3 years the quality/portion sizes keep going down and the prices just keep going up. $9.99 for a small fried calamari consisted of 12 small rings (literally...I counted) and an oversized portion of tzatziki on a huge plate. The ratio of calamari to tzatziki was embarrassing. The \"large\" dinners are simply not worth the extra $...I compared my small dinner to my husband's large dinner and the only difference was ONE extra piece of souvlaki on the skewer...portions of salad and sides were EXACTLY the same. Sad to say we will be going elsewhere when craving Greek food."}
{"text":"Cinnamon on pork does not work. Hugh disappointment.  Was waiting for this place to open. Was hoping for some greek traditional dishes. Not here."}
{"text":"Since when did pork souvlaki become as popular as four gras?  Popped in here on a regular afternoon for lunch.   Ordered the 'large' pork souvlaki dinner thinking I'd take some leftovers for dinner - but boy was I ever wrong.   Firstly - service was super friendly was seated fast, had my order arrive quickly and was provided free refills  without having to ask.   The good - the pork was amazing. Perfectly cooked, deliciously seasoned, and the rice and potatoes were spot on.   The problem really is the price to value ratio. $22 for a dinner just doesn't seem to cut it. After the drink, taxes and tip it worked out to be a $30+ lunch.   Honestly- that seems insane to me.   Food was amazing overall, however, price is absolutely insane for what was ordered."}
{"text":"The only thing I can comment on at this restaurant is their pork souvlaki. Bottom line, it's the best in the city. Succulent, flavourful and charred perfectly. Price is also right. The restaurant also offers great service. Great ambiance with good music. Staff are super friendly and prices are great. I'd have no problem recommending this as the best pork souvlaki in the city."}
{"text":"Nice patio. We had an amazing server and considering how busy they were ( taste of danforth) got well taken care of .. But the food so blah. Greek salad a joke . Limp iceberg lettuce , 2 pieces of overripe tomato and 1 olive . Chicken ok . Hubbies food very greasy."}
{"text":"I've been to Astoria many times over the years. It remains a good option, if you know what to order.  The entree portions are massive and come with a huge greek salad. It is wise to share an entree and appetizer unless you are truly starving. This may still be too much food.  Recommendations: - grilled calamari - pork souvlaki (it's their best type) - saganaki  decent options: - dolmades - mousaka  do not recommend - spanikopita (just go to Athen's bakery instead. seriously.) - lamb chops  The service is spotty, especially on weekends when they are busy. You normally get your food quite fast though.  I've been here with a larger group before, which works fairly well because you can order a nice range of appetizers and share. It also helps that the restaurant is huge, so they're more likely to seat you"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what they put in the pork souvlaki at Astoria, but its got me hooked. My other half and I can't go more than a few weeks without eating that stuff.  And ohh, the tzatziki... that thick, garlicky tzatziki.  When you get the souvlaki dinner, it comes with a greek salad and two sides - I usually carb load with potatoes and rice, and my usual dining companion will have rice and fries.  The salad is nothing special (iceberg with tomatoes and an olive or two), but generally is quite fresh and covered in a healthy portion of feta.  I love that salty feta.  The rice and potatoes are covered in that red, tomato-like sauce that you often see at Greek places, and aren't too special, and the fries are OK - but good god, when you smother it all in tzatziki you can do no wrong.  I should mention that although I have eaten in the restaurant a number of times, generally we grab it for take out as you will often have to wait for a table and the ambience is nothing to write home about.  They have the takeout ready in about 10 mins, which is just enough time to scoot over there, and it survives the trip home with flying colours.  WARNING: After consuming the tzatziki, you are going to have some serious garlic breath.  Don't plan on getting too close to anyone you are trying to impress for a good 12 hours after eating that stuff."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Portions are decent and worth the money. From the chicken to the salad and potatoes, everything was cooked right and had a lot of flavour."}
{"text":"Nobody eats the potatoes! True story. This place serves massive entree platters; almost all come with rice, potatoes and massive (separate) plate of side salad (ingredients: 1 iceberg lettuce, pieced into squares. 1 Roma tomato, halved. 1-2 pieces of seasoned, previously jarred olives. And a lot of feta cheese, crumbled). Truly Greek, I tell ya!  In all honesty, the food isn't bad. Actually the souvlakis are really good; \"small\" is usually enough unless you're really really hungry. The sides, other than the rice, are meh. I would rather order an appetizer to fill up on. The appetizers are really good. The saganaki (fried cheese) is to die for. The grilled calamari is a close second.  Are we drinking? I am surprised that the Greek restaurant does not offer ouzo on their drink menu. They do, however, serve sambuca in shot glasses with 3 meticulous coffee beans. Delish... The sambuca, that is! I highly recommend getting those. Their cocktails aren't bad either. I ordered a margarita for myself. Came in a smaller glass than usual but was made to perfection. Also, note: Beer aplenty, cider none.   Mega tippy tip? In summer months, enjoy Greek food on their patio. And observe the gorgeous people and their pooches walk around the streets. And order the saganaki."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! My first time here and I did not regret it. Service was fast and food was amazing. I love that Jessica, our waitress, was very attentive and friendly. I will definitely return here again. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Astoria was the Danforth location. I'm glad that there is a location closer to home. I had the pork souvlaki lunch express and my mom had the chicken souvlaki. Both dishes came with generous portions for the lunch hour. The quality was top notch Greek food. I will definitely return to this location and hopefully experience their dinner menu! One thing I would suggest improving is speed. We were the only customers at the time of our arrival and the food took a bit to get from the kitchen to the table. Unlike my experience at the Danforth location which was surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants on Danforth, I would recommend going somewhere else.  If there is a difference in size of the plate (i.e small or large), I expect a difference in the quantity as well.  You pay \"extra\" for certain items yet the quality and especially the quantity is lacking. Location and service are given for the two rating."}
{"text":"arggg......we had such high hopes for this restaurant.  We arrived on a Sunday night at 8:00pm. We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess who promptly seated us and gave us menus. From this point, everything went downhill.  We flipped through the menu, and waited, and waited, and waited. Servers kept passing by us, not one stopped to see if we wanted to order drinks, to greet us, to even acknowledge us. The restaurant was not busy enough to warrant this type of service (if it was busy, you'd expect some service delays). After waiting 20 minutes, we decided to leave and go to another restaurant, one that would actually acknowledge us as paying customers. Just then, a female employee, who was busy bussing a nearby table, walked by. One of us (we were a table of 4), asked if we could place an order. She stated she would be right back to take our order and off she went. She returned within 5 minutes and offered to take our drink order..then come back for our food order. By this time, we had the menu memorized and we explained that we were ready to place our full order....which she took without hesitation. From this point on she was a fairly good waitress..checked on us frequently, etc.,  although we had to ask for drink refills, whereas a more seasoned waitress would notice empty glasses and offer refills (or just bring them without asking).   Anyway, our table of 4 ordered: Saginaki - it was excellent and served with pita wedges. The chap who \"flamed\" the cheese for us was friendly. Lamb souvlaki meal  - the person who ordered it said it was excellent. She ordered fries and rice with it, but didn't like the tzatziki. Chicken souvlaki  meal - ordered with rice and potatoes. The person who ordered this dish said the chicken was \"flavorless\" and that the tzatziki overpowered the plate. 2 Pork souvlaki meals - with potatoes and rice. Perhaps the driest souvlaki I've ever had in a restaurant...it was way over cooked (despite the fact that it was riddled with fat). I've eaten at many Greek restaurants and I'd rank this as the worst souvlaki I've ever had. While the tzatziki was VERY garlicky (I prefer it that way) it was a bit too strong to compliment the meal. It was as if the owners know the food isn't great so they try to mask it with garlic.  The rice was good but the potatoes were pretty flavorless. The Greek salads that came with the meals were large and loaded with feta...they were the hi-lite to a pretty dismal meal.   While driving home the 4 of us agreed that the food/service isn't worth the trip back. Too bad....."}
{"text":"The pork  souvlaki was overcooked. Their hummus was tasteless. The greek wine they sell by the glass is not worth $10. Go somewhere else !"}
{"text":"Not terrible and portions are large, but quality could be a bit better.  My souvlaki was very oversalted."}
{"text":"I have been remiss in not reviewing this, as I've eaten here several times.  I find the food much better than the one in Greektown.  Generous portions of shish keobob and souvlaki, very well flavoured.  The come with Greek salad and two sides so you don't need to order anything else.  Modern suburban atmosphere, but not unpleasant.  Service has always been friendly here.  Don't go for other Greek dishes - their specialty is shish kebob / souvlaki and the other Greek choices are somewhat limited."}
{"text":"it has a great seating..  service is marvellous (sit down, dine in).. but if you order their chicken skeweres it will be dry.. all the time... try to go more with beef.. or other stuff...   if you want take out.. then good luck with that.. they are slow..  a bit pricey too..."}
{"text":"I've completely had it with this place. I've been coming here for ten+ plus years and I guess that's why I've given it so much time to change but after tonight I feel like it's time to call it quits.  My biggest problem with this location is that the food is not consistent. I always order the Lamb Souvlaki and the Fried Calamari. My lamb is 95% never cooked the way I like it which is medium well. It's always cooked well done. I don't get it??? Why do you bother asking me how I'd like it if you're just going to cook it the way you like???  The calamari is also hit and miss but I've never seen it like it was served tonight. It literally looked as if they picked up every old leftover from every plate, re fried it then served it to me.  On another occasion we had come in to eat with our children, I was pregnant at the time. The manager had come over to our table to let us know that a group of 40 people had just walked in so our dinner would be awhile,.. Like an hour.   Okay, no problem but being in the food industry myself would it have been so much to offer us an appetizer at least or maybe some bread in the meantime???? Children and a pregnant lady?? No brainer, right????  Another no brainer for me is when you have regular customers maybe you should acknowledge them from time to time.. I mean that is what the hospitality industry is all about.  Their waiters/waitresses are odd as well. I came here one time with my girlfriend and as we had our forks to our mouths the waitress asked us if we'd like to take our food to go?. When I complained she said that she thought we were ready to go. I didn't know I could look like I was ready to go while I was still eating?.  As you can see I've given this place way too many chances. I won't ever be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this location out as we have been to the Danforth and Mississauga location and were displeased with both.  Place itself is okay looking, very modern In it's design for a Greek restaurant. I find the Mississauga location is the most beautiful.   I was surprised they weren't playing any Greek music at this location either.. it's a nice touch when dining Greek.  As soon as we entered we could tell something wasn't right. We were shown to our table and noticed they only had two waiters working.  No crayons and paper were given to our kids which is different as they do this at Mississauga location. It's a nice way to distract the kids as it can usually take some time for the food to come out.  We noticed the Manager frantically running around and saw him working in the kitchen. At one point their was a situation in the washroom, I guess a toilet had over flooded. I saw him literally put gloves on and get a mop then attend to it.  I felt kind of bad for him and also the waiters who were running around trying to make sure they were staying on top of things. Customers just kept on showing up though..  Where were the staff? Why was their only two waiters??   Let's get to the food.. It was very fresh and tasty. My only complaint was my lamb, I've never received it with pieces of fat on it... overall it was still good.  Salads were fresh. Lettuce and tomatoes was fresh and tasty. My calamari was excellent! Fresh as well and hot!  My waiter was good, not super friendly.. but considering the position they were in (under staffed) I'm not going to blame him.  I'm not totally sure if I'd return,.. we'll see.."}
{"text":"I ordered the small pork souvlaki entree for dinner.  Came with a big plate of Greek salad.  Chose rice and potatoes for the side.  The pork souvlaki was too burnt.  The rice tasted good with the tomato sauce.  The rest of the food tasted average."}
{"text":"I tried I try or the restaurant send this one is one of the best. The quality of the food is excellent and also the people are very friendly. The seasoning is very very spicy and tasty I recommend this restaurant very highly.   Yu wil like it"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and honestly its a hit or miss.  I usually stick with the small chicken souvlaki which comes with rice and potatoes and a greek salad. The chicken is moist, flavorful, and very meaty! So even if its super expensive i would always go for it. But that delight pretty much ends there....  Tried the calimari, NOPE. It was the opposite of crispy, dare i say it was downright soggy?  Tried the salmon, and while the portion was big the taste was a huge 'meh' nothing impressive about ot and was sorta bland.   Usuallt they do a good job with my staple chicken souvlaki, but last time i got take out and ordered a large instead of small. However, when i got home it was unfortunately a small chicken souvlaki, yet i paid the full price of a large.   Overall its a hit or miss. But one thing for sure is that they make a great chicken souvlaki, other dishes? Meh."}
{"text":"Went to Astoria for their pork soulvaki on pita which came out to be $7.33 after taxes  Their portion size is decent, around 5-6 huge chunks of juicy, tender pork, coated by the super garlicky tzatziki sauce. The meat was well cooked but I wish it were more well seasoned. Pita bread was thin so it soon became soggy which I didn't really like. And I don't think they grilled the pita before loading it up. It was a super messy sandwhich. I used up 3 napkins while eating this thing. And ended up with super garlicky breath back at work. Probably not the best lunch date idea but great bite for lunch when you're eating alone and can make as big of a mess as you want  :)"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Had such high hopes for this place because I was really pleased when I went to the one on Danforth years ago.   The village salad came in a small bowl with the feta in blocks so it was difficult to even try to break up the feta and mix it. Also, the cucumbers and tomatoes in the salad were warm- not appetizing at all. We had an appetizer sampler plate to share and the tzatziki was extremely garlic-y to the point where we couldn't eat it. The pita that came with it wasn't warm. The calamari was good but nothing extraordinary.   By the time we finished our appetizer, we expected our main course to be there (chicken shawarma meal). It seemed like they just forgot about us because our water wasn't refilled once and it took them a solid 15 minutes to come by and check if we had gotten all our food. When we told them to just forget about the chicken shawarma because we wanted to leave, the manager insisted we take it home with us free of charge. Although a nice gesture, the chicken was dry as a bone and the rice was so bland.   As I mentioned, I really wanted to like this place. However, they're gonna need to make some changes before we return. Womp womp."}
{"text":"We were a party of seven and the restaurant wasn't very busy but it took a very long time for a our food to arrive after we placed our order. I had the pork souvlaki dinner with rice and fries that also came with a Greek salad to start. The salad was a let down because they served it with mushy tomatoes. The pork souvlaki was good but considering it's on the Danforth, I wouldn't accept less. The fries were basic frozen fries and the rice was also a let down because they served it with the roasted potato sauce which I'm not a fan of. Service was okay. I would have left a 2-star review but most of our party wasn't feeling well after dinner so..."}
{"text":"I was happy to discover there is a Mississauga location! The food is just as good as the Danforth location, and I appreciated not having to drive around to look for parking-there is a shared lot with plenty of spaces. The lamb chops dinner is seasoned and cooked to my liking and I've heard good things about the grilled quail. Very big portions too, and generous dollops of tzatzki!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has problems with consistency, but it has remained one of my favourite places on the danforth. I usually only go there for take-out, electing to go to pantheon when I want to get a table. At one point the grill men were actually greeks (maybe a greek guy still pulls an occasional shift) but that seems like it was ages ago.  In any case, the lamb sandwich on a bun with extra tzatziki is my pick, although sometimes the chunks of lamb are just too fatty and make for a chewing struggle. Depends on the day. Oh yeah, and be prepared for onion breath. Those are raw onions :)"}
{"text":"I finally can get Good Greek food from the Danforth in Vaughan. This operation finally made it to the north end of Toronto  With decades servicing Toronto you cant go wrong. The Greek meals are what you would expect.   This is not a 5 start establishment. It's a family, casual place for everyone.   The portions are huge and the food is fresh.  The Lamb, beef and chicken suvlaki were all perfectly cooked and prepared. The rice and potato were ok. Nothing to be wowed with.   The combo appetizer was a great choice.   Everything for the most part was very good.   The fails for this place were the wine selection was very poor. The grilled calamari was poorly done which was the worst part of the meal.   We had a party of 8 people with 4 kids and everyone ate well."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch with family..  Ordered various souvlaki plates.. Pork.. Chicken.. Beef.. All were on the dry side... Potatoes n rice were ok... Greek salad was the only saving point..   Not sure ill give it a try again..  I guess ill have to trek down to the Danforth for my greek food.."}
{"text":"2.5  Everyone who frequents the Danforth knows about Astoria.  It's a decent place but if you ask the locals, you can do better  Pros: Large place with ample seating Lamb souvlaki was very good  Cons: Prices don't reflect quality Air con is very weak at best Not a place for a quick dinner  Came by here last Sunday after my soccer game.  Even though we were a party of 12, we were seated rather quickly.  Even though this place is right on the Danforth, it's huge.  There's a ton of seats and only during the Taste of the Danforth will you find it hard to get seating.  We were seated in the back where there's a little sunroof.  This is a good and bad thing as I will explain later on.  I ordered a Lamb souvlaki dinner and my GF had the chicken souvlaki dinner.  Dinners come in small and large (you get more meat with large) and come with a greek salad and two sides.  You can choose between fries, potatoes and rice.  The Greek salad comes on a pretty big plate.  It's a pretty large salad considering it comes with the dinner.  The souvlaki was hit or miss.  My lamb was very good.  It was medium rare goodness save for the end pieces which were closer to medium but that's fine and part of the cooking process really. Still one of the better lamb I've had. My GF's chicken was a little on the dry side.  Our little one usually loves chicken but she had a hard time chewing through some of the pieces.  The rice and potatoes were average at best.    Here's the thing about this place, it pretty much runs on people knowing it's name.  When you think Danforth, you think Astoria.  However, the experience just doesn't match up to the popularity and hype.  When you're seated in the the back, there's a sunroof that basically blinds anyone during a sunny day who's seated underneath it.  Half our table had to shade our eyes constantly because of it.  They need to cover it up during a sunny day because it's not comfortable to eat like that.  Also, the air con is almost non existent.  It was a very hot day when we went and we were sweating buckets inside.  Again, not a comfortable feeling when eating.  Dinner for 2 here will run you about $60 if you don't get a drink.  Adding drinks will run you closer to $80-100 dollars.  Is it worth it?  I'm siding more with no.  The souvlaki is OK, but everything is just average and when you're paying that much, it just doesn't feel right.  I work with people from Greece and they tell me there are much better options than Astoria.  You just have to do your research."}
{"text":"We usually go here when we're in Mississauga (specifically across the street at Starsky). Some yelpers have said the prices were high, but I feel it's totally worth it for the portion size. We always have leftovers to take home. We usually go with the beef and chicken souvlaki dinners which are always cooked to perfection. One time we tried the quails and that was a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised by all the negative reviews of this place. I mean I can't say that every visit of mine has been perfect, but it's definitely been consistent in terms of the service and food.   My girlfriends and I came here for lunch on a holiday Monday. It was pretty empty at 12 but started to fill up a little. My go-to meal is pork souvlaki. It's my fave! I can't cook pork the same way as they do so it's a must each time I come here. I also love the potatoes and rice. Super flavorful. We had good service. The server was quite funny after he overheard our convo he made a joke.   Overall I've been coming here consistently for 5+ years and I haven't had a terrible meal. It sucks that they don't give away pita anymore but I get it...cost savings."}
{"text":"I went their with my family and the manager and waitress was rude.  My calamari dinner came to me all burnt and dry twice and my fries had some green stuff in their. Ive sent it back and again it came back the same way and the manager said im sorry we are really busy.  I will never go their again. Worst place I've ever went to.  I hope the owners smarten up their rude staff and get better cooks."}
{"text":"We were seated in comfortable seats and had a good view of the entire restaurant. We felt comfortable immediately. Our server Thomas was friendly and efficient. He always made us feel right at home.  We began with an appetizer, Saganaki. We were served a good portion of this flaming crispy cheese in the hot small frying pan. It is slightly salty and called for a glass of red wine.  Next, my wife had the pork souvlaki and I had the Chicken Souvlaki. We both agreed that meat had been well marinated and then cooked on the BBQ to perfection. We ate the tender and succulent chunks of meat covered in the best tasting Tzatiki in the entire GTA. You should try it. We both love it.  Unfortunately, the rice they served my wife was not warm anymore when the plate was served. Otherwise, I would give it a 5/5 instead of a 4.8/5.   On the other hand, I asked for well-done fries and the cook who made them should get a 6/5. They just couldn't have been better. The greek salad was also just what we wanted.  All in all, the evening was a great success. We received good value. The favour-buds in our mouths were dancing for hours after dinner. It is guaranteed that we will be returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"In & out in under an hour!  Came to Astoria during my lunch break with my bff and got a few lunch specials. I ordered the tamaramasalata, small greek salad and the \"add 3 butterflied shrimp for $3\". It was all pretty tasty! I really like their seafood sauce for the shrimps. Wasn't really expecting deep fried shrimp but here we are... I thought it would have been grilled. The flavour was still good. I felt a little ripped off when I compared the price to the size but hey, it was flavourful so I'm content.   The tamaramasalata is a Greek caviar which was spread on warm pita bread. I'm a fan. It wasn't very salty. I thought it was going to be black but it was pink! I think the serving size is a bit excessive but who really complains about too much food?  Oh ya - I've had Astoria catered for lunch a few times through my work, always a hit!  Now to bribe my Greek boss into letting me have the rest of the day off in exchange for left overs..."}
{"text":"Best tzatziki around.  I've frequent this location in Newmarket a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed. I usually opt for the same meal every time, while sampling new appys each visit. I love their chicken souvlaki. The rice is amazing especially when mixed with their own tzatziki sauce. The dolmades are excellent and the taramosalata was very tasty and new to me. My only suggestion would be to ask for the salad dressing on the side as they tend to abuse it's potency. Also, they love their onions so first dates beware. Portions are huge but still just as good (if not better) the second day around.  Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great covered patio with tons of seating. And generous portions of souvlaki.  The best part about Astoria is their large chunks of meat for the souvlaki. Not only are you getting your fill, but the size of meat helps the meat from drying out. If you don't like fat in your meat though, steer clear of the pork as it has its share of fat. Again, the fat does help keep it moist. The small size portion comes with 8 ounces of meat. So enough for most people. And the large size is 12 ounces. The portions for the Greek salad is also quite large and has lots of feta. Though it's kind of silly there is only one kalamata olive...  As far as the sides go the roasted potatoes were good, the rice was fine, the side veggies are crisp and definitely fresh, and the fries are soft and fluffy, though not spectacular because the outside could be crispy but not bad. You can't go wrong with of them, so pick what you are in the mood for.  Pretty solid Greek restaurant. You could do a lot worse on the Danforth for Greek food and I have."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 15years!! At the start the food was amazing! Tasted the best!. Then there was a time that it was not as great. I moved to brampton, and now i am in markham, and everytime i am down near Astoria, i have the craving. Was there about 6months ago, Service was good, The pork souvlaki always seems burnt on the edges. So i switched to Lamb souvlaki, which is so much better.  I guess people want their pork med- well done to be on the safe side, but the burnt edges is not inviting.  Other than that, one of the best greek restaurants !! Love it. For all the other reviewers, come try the pork souvlakis in brampton/thornhill/markham, you would be heading to the danforth every chance you get."}
{"text":"I ate at Astoria Shish Kebob House back in June with my husband and my parents. My parents really like coming into Toronto and trying out different restaurants and generally the places we take them are a hit, but this one didn't sit well with us. Friends of ours had recommend this place to us, but I think if you are looking for a great Greek food experience you need to look elsewhere.   I find the food is a bit overpriced for the quality. One thing I expect from a Greek restaurant is a good Greek salad, and I've had better Greek salads from some chain restaurants I've eaten at.   The one nice thing about this restaurant is the patio. They have a very large patio to accommodate many. I've heard great things about some of their appetizers, so if I'm ever to try this place again it will only be for apps and maybe a cocktail drink because their beer list is limited to domestic beers that lack flavor!"}
{"text":"***TIP:  If it is cool outside, avoid sitting under the covered patio.  It's not heated/insulated, so there is a draught that makes it quite cold to dine in.***  Service - 4.5-5 (very friendly, accommodating, upbeat) Food - 2.5-3/5 (just ok this visit)  Was debating between Astoria or Zet's, but my bf wanted a nicer, sitdown place as opposed to a 24-hour diner atmosphere.  Honestly, I didn't have a preference as I only care about good food.  In the end, we sorta wished we drove out of the way for Zet's as they have bigger portions, better prices, & tastier food - at least in comparison to this visit.    I ordered a small lamb kabob ($19.99), cooked medium-rare.  Half of the chunks were more on the rare side, so I couldn't eat them.  I'm sure I could've asked them to re-cook it, but I'm not sure how that works seeing how I already cut into each piece with my knife/fork to see the level of rare-ness.  Kinda weird, but my bf's chicken souvlaki only had 4 pieces of kabob.  Seems like 1-2 pieces were missing, just look at the photo.  Again, $17.99 is how much the small Chicken Souvlaki costs here, but at Zet's it's $14.99 and the chicken pieces are much bigger and there are more than 4 pieces!  Plus, no tipping necessary at Zet's AND there are always leftovers.  I usually share their platters between 2 people and it's more than enough food.  Overall, if you like being served, sitting down, getting drinks, you can go to Astoria.  However, if you're looking for portions and don't really care about atmosphere, go to Zet's instead!  They should also look into fixing the front door as it was constantly slamming shut when patrons would enter/exit the restaurant."}
{"text":"This has been one of the top hangout spots for me and my husband whenever we need somewhere to go for a date night and are craving Greek food. Actually, I confess that we had our first date at the Astoria location on the Danforth in Toronto so there are a lot of sentimental memories associated with Astoria for me.  We've also been to the Mississauga location with family and they seemed to like this restaurant as well.   Upon entering, the interior is fancy-looking and the design makes you feel like you're living in Greece. The hostess who greeted us was friendly and there was no wait time to get a table for us two. The menu pricing is a lot lower than average for an elegant and fancy restaurant and you get authentic quality Greek food in generous portions. I actually had leftovers from tonight which I took home and will have for lunch tomorrow. I ordered the small size Lamb Souvlaki dinner, cooked well-done, which comes with a choice of 2 sides so I chose potatoes and rice and included was a starter Greek salad, served on a large plate. I only ate half of my salad in order to save room for my Lamb dinner. The lamb and fresh tzatziki sauce combined had a nice flavor but I think next time I'll try ordering it medium well-done so that it will be easier to chew. I also loved how the rice and potatoes were soft and easily melted in your mouth. I also tasted one piece of breaded shrimp that my husband ordered with his meal and it tasted as fresh as the seafood I ate at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco a couple of months ago.    At the beginning of our evening, I was already prepared to give this place a perfect 5-star but I unfortunately had to reconsider that by the end because of the service. It started off perfectly. The waiter was quick to serve us our drinks and food and he came to refill my husband's drink without us having to ask and he checked on us.  However, when  the restaurant started getting more crowded, I started to wonder if they were short on staff because our waiter barely checked to see how we were doing and when I asked for a refill on my Gingerale, he forgot about it but I didn't remind him as he seemed busy so I instead asked for some water when we saw him walk by our table. I think we pretty much waited half an hour longer than we should have, once we were finished, before we finally got our bill. However, to be fair, we could see that he was stressed and working really hard to attend to a large crowd of people and he was still very nice to us.   On the whoIe, I would come back here in the future if we happen to be in the area and will try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Enormous portions. Calamari ok. big rings but chewy. Over cooked a bit and stringy.  Huge Greek salad with feta tomatoes. Pork souvlaki nasty. Was fatty and chewy. Chicken souvlaki good. Large portions and awesome sauce. price only 12 99 for the chicken. i guess would go only if I was in the area and craving for greek."}
{"text":"Pork souvlaki entree was burnt and extremely chewy! Pork souvlaki was full of sinew/ gristle and fat. The meal was fkn inedible and had me fearful of indigestion! Salad was limpy! Would never go back! Take ur friends to Christina's at Danforth and Logan for proper Greek cuisine."}
{"text":"Although (every location) of Astorias isn't perfect and someone's order is always wrong I still come back.... Probably because their salad dressing, potatoes and RICE are so yummy.   I hate to do this but I'll start with the negative :  Years ago they used to bring you bread/pita to the table at no additional cost when they stopped that it was annoying but fine. What gets me angry is that if you order a basket of $2.00ish pita it's the most minimal order ever not even served with  tzatziki  , oil or anything. If you want  tzatziki on the side it's another $2.00. My main meal (souvlaki dinner) comes with  tzatziki so I asked if I could get that with the pits and they said no they would have to charge me. Ugh.   I don't mind paying money for good meals but they're actually squeezing every penny out of you.   The food is usually amazing which is why I come back allllllll the time. Last night my chicken tasted like it was cooked earlier in the day and then just tossed on the grill to heat it up. That's sad because the Resturant wasn't busy which means the chef could have/ did have time to make fresh chicken.   I hate writing negative comments for a Resturant that I've been going to for years but sometimes it has to be done.   On a positive note the grilled calamari is to die for ... The side salads are a great size and the staff are usually very lovely.   If you could overlook the whole bread issue then check this place out !"}
{"text":"Amid the many Greek eateries in the Danforth, this one has stood the test of time. Great kebabs, salmon plate excellent, generous helpings, fair prices and good service. Great saganaki...Have been there several times and each time was good..."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner on a warm day. Patio was nice, service was great, BUT the salad was awful , wilted, soggy, browning, yuk.  Main dishes were great."}
{"text":"Lunch for 2 was excellent.  We both ordered from the Express Lunch menu and chose the Chicken Souvlaki for $10.99.  It came with a greek salad, tzatziki, pita bread and a choice of rice, potatoes or fries.  We chose to add the extra chicken stick for $3.99 and it was a perfect lunch portion.   The quality of the food is excellent and the service was attentive and friendly.  Our food was ready in no time and I felt the wait time was perfect - enough time for conversation.  Drink refills were no charge and our waitress checked on us regularly to see if we needed more drinks or anything else.  The construction along Yonge Street made it a bit challenging to find but now that I know where it is i will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Had takeout and dinner here and they both taste equally as good. Chicken Souvlaki is nice and juicy and there beef souvlaki is awesome.  The saganaki was really good too. I absolutely hate lamb but tried some and it tasted just like beef."}
{"text":"Great food. Great European decor.  I ordered the beef souvlaki and the beef was just perfect. Not over cooked at all.  And the saganaki was really good."}
{"text":"We booked ahead and that was a smart idea - the place was ultra packed when we arrived.  That's generally a good sign. Not that lots of people couldn't be wrong (think them many elections), but at least it gives you hope that with that huge number of customers the staff was able to gain significant experience in what they're doing...  Now seriously, the food was very good. Not the greatest of it all I ever eat, but very, very good. We've swapped some bits and pieces from different plates, and they were all yummy.  For the not so good part, service was slacking quite a bit - except for a supervisor type of guy being around. That was a monster, real professional! Immediately noticed that we were a bit cozy seated, spotted a just released table, wiped it clean and seated us there, all super polite and fast. Appreciated that a lot!  Default servers, however, were not being able to cope with a flow of people - always in rush and missing, not friendly, not caring. Hence three stars - places like that must be able to afford decent service, there's no excuse.  Price was right and portions were decent. I can absolutely recommend Astoria, except for the service part of it."}
{"text":"1st visit last evening and we will definitely return. The service and food were excellent. The environment is comfy casual. The calamari were the best I have ever had. The Moussaka was excellent according to one friend and the souvlaki dinners were great. The Tzatziki is home-made and packs a powerful garlic punch. The ONLY disappointment was with my dessert. I LOVE Baklava; it's my dessert island dessert and Greek Baklava is the best. But, not here. To be fair to the restaurant I ordered the \"special menu\" so the portion is probably more a sampling than a full order but the SAD part was they fancied up the plate with chocolate sauce! Baklava is best all on its own drowning in its own syrup . Where does chocolate factor in? As I said I will go back; food was great."}
{"text":"Honestly, you cant go wrong here. Weather it's a birthday celebration or on a night you just don't feel like cooking. The prices are great compared to the quality of food and service. These were typical Greek people. Our waiter was warm and friendly, the manager came over and checked in and asked if we wouldn't mind filling out a survey, and they definitely over fed us. The food was exceptionally traditional good Greek deliciousness. I wanted to lick my salad plate and although I couldn't get through my not-so-small chicken souvlaki at the time, it made a nice bedtime snack and slept like a baby.   We will certainly go back here and can't explain why we have drove by as much as we have without going in. My boyfriend ordered the mixed grill which was amazing and again a lot, which came home in a doggy bag. Oh and they bring you the container so you can put what you want in. I hate when servers take your food away and box it up and leave out an integral part of the meal like the tzatziki, Speaking of which Astoria's was as good as it gets.   I highly recommend this place and would definitely take friends with me as most of us are foodies and love a good meal."}
{"text":"Astoria has been around forever, and for a good reason. While other places on Danforth come and go, change ownership and menus, Astoria has consistently provided the best authentic Greek experience on Danforth, from its simple, but deliciously executed menu to slightly scuffed service. We've been coming here for years and after occasionally trying out other places on Danforth, always come back to Astoria's patio.  Their grilled calamari and tzatziki and terrasalata are by far the best you can find, the kebabs are almost always good and the village salad is absolutely delicious. The service is a bit indifferent, but if they remember your face from before, you are welcomed like a dear guest - and all of that is just another part of your authentic Greek experience. In this forever changing city, I hope Astoria remains as is for years to come"}
{"text":"VIBE I came here for take out but the vibe is your standard typical Greek restaurant. Patio is great in the summer but I miss the fountain. That said, the service was terrible. How many times do I have to say to the cook (yes, the cook took the order ---there's a cash register at the counter. Is that even hygenic?) \"I would like a chicken souvlakii\" for him to understand that yes, I would indeed like a chicken souvlaki sandwich. Maybe it's PMS but I literally had to say it slower for him. He looked at me like I was speaking alien!   I ATE Aforementioned (and to the cook three times), a chicken souvlaki on a pita. St. Hubert would be jealous of the size of the meat on this sandwich. The pork chunks looked genetically modified. There was a LOT of meat on this one (usually, some restaurants will skimp). That said, there was a faint flavour of lemon on the otherwise bland chicken and a tomato trying to get some attention from the chicken. Tomatoes need love too.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Meh. Really, meh. It's not that it's bad. It's just not GREAT. Asteria has my souvlaki money right now."}
{"text":"Ah, old faithful.  I've been coming to this Greek restaurant since before I can remember, and though it's nothing spectacular, it's my downright favourite stop for comfort food. A lively, family friendly atmosphere, with great staff, great drinks, great food, and the occasional spout of flaming cheese. Opa!   Anyways, I've tried a lot over the years, so I'll just highlight my favourites.  First - the tzatziki. Oh my. It's thick (unlike the watered down variations that I've unfortunately experienced elsewhere), incredibly flavourful, and easily the most addictive thing on the menu. It comes in a moderately sized portion, and it's seems like too much at first, but you'll finish it. And then order another. I swear to God, I could eat a plate of the stuff with a spoon. But hey, I guess on pita is the more 'polite' way to go about it. You get the gist, though - it's the best in Toronto, easy. Even though your breath will smell terrible for the next eight weeks.  Second - the grilled calamari. GIRL. I only started ordering this one recently, as I've never been that enthusiastic about fish, but I regret waiting until now to try it. The spices are spectacular, and mix flawlessly with the tzatziki. Well, anything mixes well with the tzatziki, but this is particularly great. Plus, it's never been chewy or overcooked in all the times I've tried it.  Third - the chicken souvlaki. It's been my go-to order for years, and I've yet to be let down. The chicken is well spiced and tender, and the veggies are nice and fresh. It even has loads of - you guessed it - tzatziki stuffed inside. My one critique? The pita can be a bit hard, depending on the batch you get. It's a touch hit or miss in that department. Not like it's stale or anything, it can just occasionally be a bit firmer than I prefer. Regardless, it does little to diminish a great dish, and I would certainly still say that it's one worth ordering.  Fourth - the greek salad. Now, I'm a sucker for a good greek salad, and this is one of my favourites. Fresh lettuce, delicious dressing, and a mountain of feta? Who could ask for more. It goes perfectly with any meal or by itself (though the meal-sized portion is absolutely massive), and you might even want to try mixing it with some tzatziki. No, I'm not a lunatic. Just try it, I promise.  So, if you and your family are ever near the Danforth, do yourself a favour and come to Astoria. Then order eight plates of tzatziki to go, and maybe drop a few off a my place."}
{"text":"I must say I was hardly impressed at first, a waitress sat us in another waiters section, there was maybe one or two other tables when we walked in here.   I really started to feel like a nuisance to our waiter, he came by and took our drink order and I ordered an appetizer at the same time, he had pen to paper waiting for me, I just looked at him like how many appetizers can three adults eat. He came with the side plates just kinda dropping them on the table, which was loud and annoying. I get he could have been having a bad day and all, but the device industry only gets one shot with a new customer.   Luckily for him, the food was amazing, the chicken was perfectly cooked, the rice wasn't dry and had a nice amount of sauce, the tzatziki sauce was nice and garlicky, just how I like it, and the roasted potatoes were nicely cooked and soft. The salad had a decent amount of dressing, they didn't cheap out, everything was good.   We had dessert, then a hard time to find the waiter to get our bill settled. Once we did get his attention he couldn't find the machine, then when he finally did he stood there impatiently while we did our thing.   I've been to other locations, but the food here seemed to be better, the service on the other hand was pretty poor. When we come back I'd contemplate asking not to sit in his section if I saw him."}
{"text":"We went here for my husband's birthday. My husband ordered the chicken souvlaki with butterfly shrimp, potato with rice and a salad. The portions were enormous. The salad alone was big enough for a meal and they definitely didn't skimp on the feta.  They didn't have much in the name of gluten free so I had a Greek salad (sigh) with chicken on top. The chicken was actually really nicely cooked and with some tzatziki sauce it was great. The salad was also massive, so I was pretty full by the end, despite not having any carby-goodness to fill me up. My husband really enjoyed his meal (I believe it was a December special). His brother had the pork souvlaki and said it was dry.  The waiter was new and didn't have the best manners but I'll attribute that to a learning curve rather than not having good communication skills and hope I'm right. He did bring my husband a free slice of cake with a candle at the end of the meal.  I think I'd be back for the tzatziki sauce alone.  Side note: they do not provide free bread - I guess they did at some point, but the waiter said they no longer do."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Astoria since the early 80's, when they were still next door and they use to serve a delicious garlic bread with the meal. The portions were generous, well cooked and the pork souvlaki was the best in town... Today, April 26, 2016 is the last time I am going to eat here. The changes in ownership and in the menu completely transformed this place into a 'has been' without care for nothing more than the bottom line.  The pork souvlaki today was the fattest, grisliest and most chewable ever. Throwing in butterflied shrimps is nothing but a gimmick. It's time to move on... The search for a good souvlaki continues..."}
{"text":"I visited Astoria yesterday evening - a Wednesday night, with a group of 10.  I also visited about 2 months ago. The general group consensus was \"food was awful.\" All the dips on the menu were tasteless and badly in need of flavour and texture. The chicken and beef kabobs were overcooked consequently dry and tasteless; service was poor.  AND, the attendant had the nerve to add a 30% tip to the bill.  In hindsight, we should have objected to paying the tip.  I used to love Astoria. Recently, the location on the Danforth has been going from bad to worse.  I can't imagine what's going on with this location.  And the restaurant was not busy. Just plain sloppy, bad cooking and poor sevice."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the grilled chicken salad for lunch. The chicken was tender and flavourful. It is a bit expensive for  Newmarket my salad was $14 plus taxes and tips. The service was a bit  slow. Beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Very authentic Greek food. Everything made from scratch and on site.   Must try their Tzatziki, Greek Fries, Pork Souvlaki and Chicken Pita.   They even sell Sangria now...(even though it's Spanish drink, they make it good)."}
{"text":"Went to Astoria on Rutherford for weekday dinner. The place was 1/3 full so the service was good.  We ordered the lamb souvlaki dinner with potatoes and rice and salad.  The salad came first and it was a very good size but there was no feta cheese that we could see.They use an oil dressing which was tasty and there were lots of tasty tomato chunks and white onions.  Next came the dinner plates and again, the portions are very good, so much so that we had to take some home.  But the lamb (cooked medium) had some good pieces and some chewy not so great pieces.  The flavour of the lamb was good. However, the tomato sauce on the rice and potatoes was very average and quite mild.   On the other hand the tzatziki was plentiful and very very garlicky and heavy. Some may like their tzatziki this way, it was fine but it really stays with you hours later."}
{"text":"Good food, ok presentation, ok service. Three stars!  Craving Greek, I went her with a friend on her recommendation, and the food was definitely delicious!   We had the trio of dips to start, served with a basket of warm pita. Two of the dips, the hummus and tzatziki, were absolutely delicious, while the third (the fishy one?) was kind of questionable. I would definitely recommend doing the \"two dips\" appetizer instead.   For a main, we both had the \"Small Chicken Souvlaki\". The chicken is tender and well seasoned, and I'm sooo happy they took it off the skewer. I hate wrestling with those. This was served with a Greek salad, potatoes, rice, and a smear of tzatziki. So while the food was good, it wasn't the most attractive presentation ever.... it kind of looked like they had just used a spatula and wiped the side of my plate with tzatziki... a little gross... and the plate was kind of empty overall, even though there was a ton of food.   While the servers were really sweet and nice, they were a little slow and it took forever to get our bill. When we got the bill I found out my diet coke cost almost as much as a glass of wine (lesson learned, always drink), and in total, we spent $30 each for something that maybe should have cost $20, max.  So while this was a good experience, I think it would have been better if it was take-out. The food is delicious, but for the price, everything else could have been a little better."}
{"text":"For Mother's Day we decided to try Astoria after my mother and her friends had a positive experience several weeks back. Being the proactive person that I am I decided to make a reservation which was an excellent idea considering what day it was (Sunday and Mother's Day). Upon arrival we were promptly seated in the comfortable and modern dining room.  We ordered the appetizer plate of Taramasalata which is a Greek caviar paste served with pita bread. It was good and not as salty as I remember this type of spread being. We're off to a good start so far. Next up, our Greek salads arrive (each main course came with a salad). The salad was excellent with a good amount of dressing and feta cheese. Their dressing is definitely homemade. Bonus points for not overdoing it on the tomatoes (not a fan of too many in my salads). Despite the salad being an included accompaniment to the main courses, it was very plentiful in size. Shortly after our salad plates were cleared the main courses arrived. I had ordered the 8oz beef sirloin souvlaki with potatoes and rice (each main comes with your choice of 2 side orders). I had ordered my beef cooked medium however it was closer to medium-well. Not wanting to wait for a re-do and hold up my family I opted to eat it anyway. Unfortunately, the pieces of beef were somewhat fatty which is a turn-off for me. One piece of the five or six I received was nearly 70% fat. To me, it is not acceptable to serve souvlaki with that much fat on it. All in all, I was not overly impressed with the beef portion of my meal. Fortunately, the potatoes, rice, and delicious homemade tzatziki helped improve the meal drastically. Their tzatziki with its excellent garlic flavour and a thick texture was some of the best I've had in a sit-down restaurant. The chicken souvlaki (white-meat) and grilled calamari my parents ordered were both excellent according to them.   While I would certainly return to Astoria's Vaughan location, I will be opting to try another main course from their menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they are consistently good. Staff is very patient and friendly which we needed because we could not figure what we wanted. Ended up going with what yelp recommends which was good and filling. A little too much on the starches though."}
{"text":"Great authentic greek food at a nice open and friendly restaurant. Place felt very friendly walking in and it was still friendly walking out. fries were amazing for some reason. all the meat items were very good too. Will have to come here again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent family restaurant,  they have great service and a comfortable ambiance.  My husband and I always get the souvlaki  dinner and the meat is done to perfection.  They also have the best Greek salad I've ever tried.  This restaurant is a must try,  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. I don't often review but thought this one needed one. I am not sure what went wrong for the other posters but we were a party of 4 and we ordered two mains and one appetizer and we left stuffed.   We had the grilled calamari which was perfectly cooked. We also had the lamb chops and the beef Souvlaki. The beef is by far the best beef souvlaki I have had in this area.   This is easily the best Greek restaurant in Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"I have to say that we were in the mood for some Greek food for a while now and haven't got the chance to satisfy this craving until last night. We were in Toronto for some business and decided to have dinner in the Greek Town. We chose Partheon as our venue but the place was so crowded with a lineup outside that we decided to switch to Astoria, where we got to seat right away even though the place was packed.  We started with appetizers, Greek fries and grilled calamari. The fries come topped with feta cheese and oregano and I think some tomato sauce. I would have added a bit of garlic to that sauce or at least a tzatziki dip on the side. Nevertheless, they were good enough. The grilled calamari were absolutely amazing. Served with olive oil and garlic, we were really impressed.  For our main course we went for a salmon and shrimp entree and a mixed grill platter. The platter comes with a quail, pork souvlaki and lamb chops. A huge portion. And before the meal comes out we were treated with some Greek salad which surprisingly lacked olives. Only one on top is not enough.  The sides that come with them are forgettable, but the tzatziki is the best we had. The pork souvlaki is good, the spices that they use to marinate it in are giving the meat a nice flavour, but the meat could have been selected better. All the pork cuts had a lot of fat in them so I ended up throwing a third away. The lamb chops are really disappointing and the only thing on the menu that I regret having. The quail was a really nice touch and it complemented the meats beautifully.  From my wife's platter, the salmon was good and both it and the shrimp were cooked just right. The broccoli were a little overcooked though.   In the end, we were happy with our meal. Granted that the lamb chops were as bad as they could get, this place gets 4 stars for the service, atmosphere and most of its food options. I'll finish by saying that all of it, with a beer and a glass of wine, ended at 80 bucks. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Have been going to astorias since I was a kid down on the danforth.  When they opened in Mississauga started going there and when they opened up in Newmarket close to home then went there.  This place is amazing, there tzatziki sauce has to be there best around, very garlicy.  Feta on the Greek salad is so good.  Get the lamb souvlaki!!!!  Service at this place is really good.   Management is always friend and super nice.  Only thing is there prices seem to keep going up  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My favorite place since I was a child. I have been coming here for years and the food phenomenal.  I have since moved to the states and So many Greek restaurants stateside give you this soupy like tzatziki, but it's done right here!  I love it for the nostalgia and for the food. Every time I'm in Toronto I try to stop here at least twice."}
{"text":"We always have a meal here when we come to Toronto.  Best lamb souvlaki ever and love love love the roast potatoes as well.  The Tzadziki is also awesome!"}
{"text":"i have been going here for years but recently within the past 2yrs i have found it has really gone down hill. i have stopped going because of the food quality. ITS NOT THE SAME! everything taste like its freezer burnt. the fries are gross,the rice is gross,the salad is so thrown together with shitty lettuce.even the chicken taste weird. so disappointing. the tzatziki is still my fave but thats not enough for me to go back. the servers are still very good and there is always no wait time. they really need to focus more on food quality and not so much just putting food out that is quick and easy. its sad that i wont be returning cause it use to be so good."}
{"text":"I came here with a few coworkers for lunch. I had the pork suovlaki with potatoes and salad. The pork had this nice hint of cinnamon, which was different for me, but very delicious! I would go back again if in the area."}
{"text":"We order take out from here frequently. Food is great but they have yet to get our order correct. Maybe it's because it's so noisy in the background when you order over the phone. But just be aware you may not end up with exactly what you have ordered. That being said, we will continue to do take out on our way home after a long week."}
{"text":"We got takeout from Astoria, and the food was OK, but not great. Overall, I found that the meat was not the highest quality. We were asked how we'd like the meat cooked, and when we asked for 'medium rare', we were told it would be \"too red\", so we asked for 'medium'. Instead, we got very dry (beyond 'well done') meat. Here are specifics:  Taramasalata appetizer - 2/5 Did not have a nice fish roe flavor, but instead was just plain salty.  Tzatziki - 3/5 Was nice and garlicky but missing cucumber and dill.  Garlic bread - 2/5 Was like hot dog buns, not great.  Beef kebab - 4/5 Nice flavor, but way overcooked  Lamb kebab - 3/5 Meat was not very flavorful, and way overcooked.  Pork kebab - 2/5 Meat was not very flavorful, and way overcooked.  Rice - 3/5 Nice and flavorful.  Baked potato - 3/5 Nice and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great family place.   Great food.  Great service.  Great dinner.  I'll be back.   We ate adding this to our list of casual dinner places."}
{"text":"I had dinner here in a large group for my cousin's grad party. She picked a great place for the venue -- the ambiance was casual yet upscale enough for the occasion, appropriate for a somewhat loud group, and the food was delicious.   I had the saganaki (how can you go wrong with flaming cheese?) and vegetable souvlaki, both of which were great. The portion sizes were gigantic, with an included entree-size salad preceding the souvlaki, which itself consisted of a huge kabob, lots of potatoes, and much rice.  I can't speak for most of the menu because I'm vegetarian, but everyone else I went with was very happy with their food, so I think I got an accurate impression."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Go here often for birthdays. Fair prices for generous servings. The staff is always corpus and polite. They are not slow, but service is not rushed. It is a place to sit and enjoy your meal with friends. Also great- the bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. Often there is a lineup/wait so you may want to call for a reservation."}
{"text":"I don't get it. My friends organized a group event here and said this place is awesome. I came here and didn't think it was awesome at all.  The Saganaki (cheese on this grill plate) tasted like goat cheese, yuck! The calamari was good, but the sauce was waaay too garlicky (and i love garlic) The entree pork shishkebob was bland giant overgrilled pieces of meat with whatever starch you asked for for sides. We had rice and fries. The fries were gross. Entree comes with a greek salad the serve before the meal itself, and you end up feeling like crap after all the heavy meat and starch. it was too filling but utterly unsatisfying. Cheap though, as we paid $17 for a large meal shared by two people."}
{"text":"I would like to rate this place a 5 but that would have been many years ago.  The prices have gone up and the portions have adjusted downwards.  The souvlaki is still AMAZING though.  They stopped serving warm garlic bread while you wait for your order.  What a shame.  It was really good.  I hesitate to got back there now because the experience is not as good as it used to be.  They are competing with their own record of excellence.  If you don't have a point of comparison to the past, you will probably enjoy it.  The staff have always been friendly.  It is conveniently located near Pape subway station."}
{"text":"MASSIVE FOOD POISONING - I had the Pork Souvlaki dinner on Friday, the 3rd of December and the meat was definitely undercooked. I spent the entire night with abdominal pain, and ended up in the ER the next day after vomiting multiple times. Had to get 3 shots just to relieve the pain and nausea, and I am still suffering.  Service was mostly non-existent and our waiter greeted us by saying \"do you know what you want?\". I am making sure that none of my friends ever visit this place again."}
{"text":"Patio! Patio! Patio!  Astoria Shish Kebob House has one of the nicest patio in Greektown, that alone worth 1 star.  I am a little bias as I don't like Greek food too much.. nothing ever wow me.. they are either too bland or too sweet.. Greek Salad would be the last thing I enjoy eating...  The dip I shared with fellow yelper was meh... and thanks for a nice yelper that gave me a taste of his grilled Calamari which was quite ok.. but my Yelp Drinking Buddy's lamb was just dry and bland...  So I just want a drink.. nothing more...nothing less... on this beautiful patio next time...  Maybe I have to try REAL Greek food?? Probably not in Astoria though!"}
{"text":"The salad did not taste fresh and was very bland.  The meat was very tough and poor quality not to mention the meal was served in an extreme plate of oil.  Very overpriced and expensive for bad quality."}
{"text":"My favourite Greek restaurant on the Danforth, partially because of traditions. It has become the \"birthday restaurant\" for me and a friend, the restaurant we go to on both our birthdays, almost every year. We usually order the same thing, because it's what we crave, and we leave happy (and sometimes drunk).  Astoria House is still a great restaurant, despite traditions. It has a cute interior that is half-Greek palace, half-Swiss Chalet. It's home-y but still restaurant-y. You walk past the kitchen as you walk in so you can see exactly what is going on in there, which is always comforting. Most of the waiters on staff are older Greek men who love to ask if you're Greek if you have dark hair. They're mostly adorable though, and are really attentive and helpful.  The menu is a classic Greek restaurant menu. A choice of Chicken, Beef, or Lamb souvlaki that comes with rice, potatoes and a Greek salad. Small or Large? The small is actually quite large so unless you're ravenous, I'd stick with small. Their deep fried calamari is SO good, and their Greek salads exceed the standards.   This place does tend to get pretty busy, so get reservations for weekend dinner. And don't even think about going during Taste of the Danforth...it gets insane!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a very late dinner. I was in Greek town and in need of some kebob. Our server was really nice and the restaurant was huge. We ordered a large chicken kebob plate to share. We figured it would be enough for two people because it was about $30. Unfortunately, when we got it, it was one small portion. I don't understand why it costed so much for what we got. The food however did taste delicious. The chicken was really yummy. I was just let down by the portion size."}
{"text":"Trustworthy spot.  The tzatziki is packed of raw garlic so beware if you're in for date night!  Lemon potatoes are good and menu is solid."}
{"text":"Super slow service and way over priced. I ordered the calamari diner with rice and veggies. The calamari was rubbery and the veggies were barely cooked. Could not cut the broccoli with my knife."}
{"text":"I loved it here...but they've decided to stop providing bread with your meal.  The only greek restaurant know of to do this.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in university!   Amazing food.   Great sagnaki, Greek salad, and I just love the lamb souvlaki. And of course the baklava!   Service can be uneven/not around nearly enough.   It's the only thing that they need to fix!   Oopa!"}
{"text":"OPA!  Order the \"Saganaki\" Appetizer for a blazing surprise! It's a delicious panfryed cheese!   Friendly Greek restaurant located in Greet Town.  The Chester subway stop is litteraly a few steps away from the restaurant.  Yummy food. Big portions.  Really fun!  Recomended: Do make reservations for dinner especially on the weekend; gets VERY busy."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dinner. The ambiance is quiet, clean, and modern. Perfect for a lunch meeting, where people can talk. The food was very good. Likely the best Mediterranean I've had in a while. Love the lamb option in addition to the beef, chicken and pork. Very hearty servings, quality food, at a reasonable price. You won't be disappointed and you certainly won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"A couple of ladies from work took us here for lunch and this restaurant has changed my perspective on Greek Food (after many horrible experiences).  The service was quick, tentative and friendly. The decor is unique and you feel like you are in Europe.   Since we were here for lunch and I've had many unpleasant experiences in the past- I decided to play it safe and went for the chicken souvlaki lunch entree with french fries and veggies. To start we had a some platters of fried calamari and pita bread with tzatziki dip.   I personally prefer lightly golden/breaded calamari but this was still very delicious and cooked to perfection. The warm pita and tzatziki dip were AMAZING. I could personally have a bucket of it myself without hesitation.  My lunch entree was a big portion but it didn't look overwhelming on the plate. The chicken was grilled perfectly but the chunks were large- would prefer perhaps smaller but more pieces. The fries were also thick cut and the veggies were steamed perfectly.  I truly enjoyed my experience at Astoria and would love to go back and try their grilled calamari and some other dishes!  I highly recommend if you are into Greek food or looking to try it, give this place a shot :)"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. The food is always great although the original location is significantly better. I had the golden fried calimari and the large beef souvlaki. The beef was good. the salad is a huge portion and is always good. The portions in general is huge and the food is made well. the golden fried calimari was burned though. I remember a time where they offered bread though."}
{"text":"Good meal, great service. I wouldn't visit again only due to the slightly high prices for food on par with most of the quick joints on the Danforth. Decent environment, I would recommend people give it a try, but be prepped to pay a lot more than the Mr. Greek down the road."}
{"text":"My go-to Greek restaurant for authentic souvlaki.  The meat is always tender and the service is adequate.  They are always very friendly but you may have to request water or salad.  The pork souvlaki is the best but the chicken is decent as well.  The \"small\" portion is not so small and is more than enough for one sitting!"}
{"text":"Overall the food is decent but I feel as though the prices are a bit high. $23 for a large chicken souvlaki dinner is a bit high for my liking. The chicken is tasty, as is the tzatziki. The sides could use improvement. The potatoes were a bit bland and the rice tasted off, maybe because it was at the end of the night. The salad was alright, nothing special about iceberg lettuce topped with some feta.   3/5, I'll give it another shot in the future and try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner.  Ordered a lamb souvlaki - came with salad and potatoes and we got a glass of wine. The food is ok - nothing mind boggling or memorable. The salad was huge but the amount of souvlaki was underwhelming.   Service was friendly so that saves the rating. Otherwise, nothing special to note."}
{"text":"Great ambience, awesome lamb souvlaki, and other standard Greek fare. The homemade tzatziki was very garlicky, and good. Thought the rice was a tad watery, and the Service slow, even though it wasn't very busy. Overall, I'd come back."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Astoria! Coming from Vancity, I needed my souvlaki fix, so my ex-roomate took me to Astoria. I was hooked, amazing Tzatziki and the lamb kebobs were wow-just unreal. But coming here again, I was so disappointed. Imma just be honest, it was really bad. The greek salad is just wilted shredded lettuce with slivered onions. \"Well dude..you don't go to greek for the salad, it's about the meat!\"..I got you..I agree. The lamb souvlaki I asked for medium rare, it came out well done. When I asked the server to check it out, she took it back super fast and came back with rare kebobs. So..I basically STFU, ate half of it, took it home, and nuked it to make it medium rare..True story."}
{"text":"Day 2 of taking my suddenly married but single friend for another night out of food.  This time we chose something I glanced at random in Yelp around his area.  At the server's recommendation I had their beef souvlaki, it is more expensive than Zet's and less volume.  Tastes good, the portions were just right I wasn't full in the end, but I am satisfied (I don't think there would be room to finish dessert if I tried).  Only problem I had was I chose medium, guess I was tired, I should have chosen medium rare instead.  Tried a piece of the pork souvlaki and it tender, not tough.  I can't say it was juicy, but maybe because I picked the end piece.  I would go here again if I want a more classier Greek experience which is different  from the cheaper, but still good fare I usually go to such as Johnny's and Esquire around my home.  No free Wi-Fi and the price being a bit higher is what would prevent me from giving this a 5-star."}
{"text":"We arrived as a party of four. We were seated relatively quickly for how busy it was, so we were happy.   As soon as we sat down, our waiter greeted us with water and we ordered some dolmades. The dolmades again came relatively quick (I'm assuming they are pre made and stuck in a fridge). They were none the less delicious. Our waiter came back and we placed our orders. I asked him rather than two starchy sides (potatoes and rice) could I have veggies? His response was \"we don't have any\". How in the bloody hell does a prominent GREEK RESTAURANT ON DANFORTH not have veggies as a side? \"I can give you more rice and a bigger salad\". With no other option, I agreed.   Then the salads arrived. This is where the evening really began to descend down hill. Upon beginning to eat my salad, I came across moulding lettuce. Disgusting. -2. Even McDonalds has fresh lettuce.   Then the food came. The chicken, flavourful but burnt to a crisp. The rice, severely under cooked. Actually that bad. Rice was in the water no longer than 2 minutes. Totally inedible. The only thing worth eating on the plate was the tzatziki sauce, even that was full of garlic. Not to mention my plate looked like it was platted by an 8 year old making their parents dinner.   After dinner, we waited 20 minutes till the waiter returned. I counted 8, yes 8, waiters working one side of the restaurant. Still took 20 minutes, then another 10 to pay. When I didn't tip his sorry ass the 20% he was expecting he just tossed the bill on the table. Some nerve this 40 yr old waiter had. If you're that miserable and hate life, get a career you enjoy. Your services were atrocious and food inedible. You're not getting a 20% tip.   As one of the longest lasting main Greek restaurants on the Danforth, I was severely unimpressed. Will never return here again.   Use to come here all the time and never has it been this bad. I hate to say it but after reading some of the fellow Yelp reviews, the majority of the bad ones hold true. I guess coming here on Taste makes no difference as I originally thought.   Final conclusion: Pass and try something else down the road. This place knows its popularity and they no longer care about the service or food. 1/5 for me, only cause Yelp doesn't allow ZERO."}
{"text":"Greeted at 8pm sat night by friendly hostess.  Our party of 10 seated pretty fast.   Had the grilled calamari (3 pieces) served natural grilled with lemon, euro style. Not for everyone but tasty. I like mine with olive oil. Pay 3.99 extra to upgrade your greek salad to village salad (horiatiki).  Pork souvlaki dinner is done to perfection. I usually prefer chicken but their pork is so tasty.  Comes with rice and potatoes too.  Our young server was really attentive and friendly too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff , great service and food.  We had pork souvlaki dinners, grilled squid , grilled salmon , grilled shrimp and desserts.  Cheesecake and baklava were nice but I love the cappuccinos.   Andy is great.  Always mixing with guest to make sure everyone is happy."}
{"text":"Yummy grilled pork and chicken kabobs.  Had the grilled calamari for and appetizer.    lg pork and lg chicken kabob dinners, Came with greek salad and sides for the kabob dinner.  Clean resto with seating for lg groups avail.  They do a great job of ensuring meats cooked to your liking of medium well or medium.   Manager / owner drops by to say hi and checks on guest.  Friendly staff and attentive."}
{"text":"I love Astoria! It's definitely a go to of mine when visiting the Danforth and the fact that they brought a few locations north is awesome!  Every experience I've had there has been great, friendly and quick service.  I usually order the chicken souvlaki dinner or a chicken greek salad. Can't go wrong. They have the best tzitziki though!! It's so garlicky and strong unlike others!! I love it! Just don't make plans to kiss anyone afterwards haha  Will definitely return, maybe I'll check out the Vaughan location!"}
{"text":"Astoria hands down makes the BEST pork souvlaki! If anyone has ever been to the Taste of the Danforth, the line up for a stick of there succulent pork souvlaki is always a mile long!  My family of five came in on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm for dinner. Be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations on Saturday night. However the wait was quite short, 10 minutes max. We chose to sit inside as it was 40+ degrees outside but they have a gorgeous patio that borders Chester Avenue. The restaurant was filled with lots of large groups and other families dining as well.  I have been here soo many times but I always end up ordering the Pork Souvlaki Dinner and I definitely recommend it! I can't say enough about it, its cooked perfectly, juicy insides, nice char on the outside, tender and seasoned soo well it makes my mouth water thinking about it. This piggy will definitely change your take on Souvlaki!  It comes in two sizes Small and Large. The differences is the size of the chunks of meat, the Large size has significantly larger chunks of meat and a few more chunks so make sure you have a big appetite to tackle the large but the small as deceiving as it sounds is quite a hefty portion itself, still larger than most restaurant portions of souvlaki.   But before your dinner arrives you are welcomed with a basket of sliced white bread and butter. Next comes the Greek salad. I love that the greek salad isn't served on your plate with the souvlaki instead they give you a huge plate of delicious greek salad with ample amounts of feta sprinkled on top!   They time everything perfectly so as you finish your salad then they bring out your entree. Along with your souvlaki you get the option of 2 sides. I have tried all sides but my favourite has to be the rice! It's soo fluffy, cooked perfectly and seasoned well, it arrives steaming hot plus they top it off with some of the \"potato gravy\" (sort of like the drippings and mashed up remnants of the greek potatoes sounds gross but its genius!). You can also get there tender and flavourful greek potatoes, thick cut french fries, or vegetables for an extra charge. All sides taste amazing you can't go wrong! Plus a side of there delicious perfectly garlicy Tzatziki sauce to top it all off!  From great service, to spectacular food, huge portions, and good company Astoria is the perfect place to get your souvlaki fixing. Definitely come in and try the PORK and get the large if you dare! It can't be beat!  FYI It's conveniently located right outside Chester Subway Station!"}
