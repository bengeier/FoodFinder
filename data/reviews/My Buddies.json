{"text":"Another sports bar, Babes, and a Hooters \"breastaraunt\" knock-off, The Tilted Kilt, have previously occupied this large space in an east side Target parking lot. For My Buddies' sake, let's hope they do better. 

Here at 1pm on a Wednesday, and I was only 1 of 3 occupied tables. I can't see that they've changed the decor much, except they're probably a lot lighter on the sports memorabilia than the previous tenants. Lots of tvs showing various ESPN channels. 

The menu is typical sports bar fare with an emphasis on burgers and sandwiches, although there are also entrees, pasta, salads, desserts, and appetizers.   I may have to try their Cajun pasta at some point. 

Full bar with a mediocre assortment of beer taps. It gets a little better for local selection if you don't mind a bottle. Happy hour is from 11-6, Mon-Thu (that seems excessively happy!). They also have some drink specials, including a \"Mystery Bucket\" for $8.  This intrigues me, and if I wasn't in the middle of a workday and felt like blacking out, I could see myself considering trying one. 

Lunch specials today were a open faced beef roast, and a BBQ rib snadwhich - or half a sandwich and a cup of soup.  I wasn't very hungry and after hearing their soups were homemade, i made the pedestrian choice of a bowl of chicken dumpling soup. They didn't skimp on the chicken, and while I'm probably not normal and prefer my soup spicier, it was still pretty good. The waiter kept offering extra crackers which I guess are in high demand. Not that I didn't appreciate that he was a crack(er) pusher, I just found it funny. 

So if you're looking for a decent bowl of soup for $3.50, you can come here. Right now though I don't think this place gets very busy unless there's a Badger or Packer game on.  I'll try a more traditional selection the next time I stop by (if it's still open, as mentioned previously I think this location is risky)."}
{"text":"My husband, my son and myself stopped by on a Tuesday night for dinner. We ordered the Nachos with cheese & salsa. Basic, but delicious. There was plenty of cheese sauce on nachos and it paired well with our fries too. We each had the special-$5 Cheeseburger and Fries. I was expecting it to come with just 'basic' fries, but we got to choose from their 4-5 types of fries. We both chose the Ranch Steak Fries--YUM!. The burgers were good sized, tasty bun and toppings and cooked as we requested. Our son had the mini corn dogs and fries--it was a big portion for a child's meal, but he enjoyed it. \"Dave\", who we assumed was the owner/manager, had overheard our son say he wanted to see the kitchen. He stopped by our table and gave our son a kitchen tour. He was so excited! This is the first time we've seen that done--a very nice, personal touch.
Another thing we liked about this place was the volume of the tv's. They were loud enough to hear, but not too loud like most sports bars. 
Good prices, great food, good atmosphere~~we'd recommend it."}
{"text":"We have been to my buddies 5-6 times. Every time the service has been very very slow. The food is pretty good, but some things on the menu are a little blah. It is a bar but they are offering things like prime rib dinners so they should deliver. The last time we were there was a push over the edge. The food came out about an hour after our soup. One of our soda's had a bug in it and it was on our bill when we got it. When I told her I did not feel we should have to pay for our drinks she told me she would only take one drink off our bill. I couldn't believe it was on there in the first place. We kept going back because they do support local and we really liked a few things on the menu. The service is just lacking too much- from the crabby lady at the door to the really slow waitresses when they are not busy, it's not worth going back."}
{"text":"No, I don't think that My Buddies and I are going to be able to be friends. Went there for a couple of appetizers, beers and football, plus a couple of waters. We got the football served promptly, but no one seemed interested in serving us either food or drink. We managed to flag (tackle) a server who was walking by, and got our beers in short order. A beer later, we still had no food, and it was not busy at all. There appeared to be plenty of staff on hand, I just have no idea what they were doing. Too bad, really, because the food was actually pretty good when it arrived.

We ate, stacked our plates (still waiting for water), and watched another quarter with no service at all. Had to go the bar for the bill, paid it and left. 

On the plus side, the bathroom was very clean."}
{"text":"I've been to My Buddies THREE times.  Each time I wanted to like it, each time I was severely let down.

The only pro is: the food is good.
My boyfriend and I live right up the street so the convenience of location could've made us regulars. But we aren't.

Our first trip there was for a late lunch and to watch some football.  My boyfriends a packers fan and I'm a bears fan (boo, I know).  Anyway.  Our first waitress was good, she checked up on us regularly and understood we were there to watch the game.  Unfortunately her shift ended before the game was over so we closed our lunch bill with her and she handed us off to waitress #2.  With waitress #2 I ordered a beer.  About 15 minutes into her shift she was \"cut\" and asked if we'd close our bill with her and our next waiter or waitress would be over in a minute. REALLY?!  You want me to close my tab on ONE BEER.  I know they do this mostly so they can get their tip, but you're that desperate for a $1 tip?  The bill was $3.75 and I put a $5 in with the bill.  At this point I'm slightly irritated that I'm closing a second tab.  She comes back and says \"do you need change?\".. I said yes.  I don't like being asked, you're that lazy and ready to go that you can't walk an extra 10 steps to drop the change off?  I left her the $1.25 on the table.
So we left immediately after the game and didn't bother opening a third tab.

The second time was for a brewers game and packers game.  We headed down at the end of the baseball game (it's less than a minute away from us) probably around the 7th inning.  The packers game started at 3:15 that day.  Our waiter was good, he forgot our waters for about 15 minutes but no biggie he eventually remembered and he was extremely personable.  The brewers game ended at around 3.. and shortly after 3pm my boyfriend asked if they'd have the packers game on.  Whoever works the monitors clearly isn't trained well.  It wasn't until 3:20 that they finally got the packers game up.  I thought this was a sports bar? .. shouldn't they be on time with games?  He wasn't the only packers fan irritated by that.  Unfortunately again our good waiter was cut before half time.  We closed our tab with him and he said our new waitress would help us out.  This waitress happened to be waitress #2 for our first visit.  Let me say, she's the worst waitress ever.  She NOT ONCE checked on us.  She chatted it up with the table on our left for about 10 minutes, checked on the table to the right and never stopped to check on us.  In the mean time, I'm assuming it was a manager, yells across the dining room to the host \"Hey KYLE!  you aren't scheduled on Tuesday but could you be here for the meeting?\"  Seriously?  you're that lazy you cant get up and walk across the room to ask him?  WOW.  Needless to say, we left at the half.

The third time we went it was just for drinks somewhere around 930pm (maybe) on a saturday night.  We sat down at the pretty vacant bar.  The bartender was busy chatting with other employees who were off duty having a drink.  Once she finally noticed us she was nice, got us our beer and went back to her conversation.  The bar was dead.  They played poorly functioning music videos and went from 80's rock to really bad hip-hop.. weird choices.  They still had espn on one TV though.  We stayed for 3 beers each I believe and than decided the really annoying douchebag hitting on the off duty waitress & bartender was too irritating to listen to anymore.

But like I said, they have good food... however, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Management, Fantastic Food, Slow Service

The service at My Buddies is slow, make no mistake, you do not want to go there for lunch if you are on a clock.  Expect dinner to take a while as well, leaving you lots of time to watch the game.  It doesn't matter if they are packed or empty.  

Like any restaurant, they have incidents of less than stellar service, but the management is quick to make it right.  Their reputation is important, and they care if you are a return customer.

When you go, make sure you enjoy their chips......Irish Nachos or Warm with the French Onion Dip."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times food was great! I had the Rib-eye steak and was very good. The service was excellent the server was extremely friendly and all of her recommendations made our meal even more amazing."}
{"text":"Came in with my parents on a Saturday night around 730pm for the prime rib special they offer on Saturdays. It was also the same night as UFC 148 and they were airing the fights. For $11 bucks you get an 8 oz prime rib, side of fries (sweet potato crinkle cuts!!) and soup or salad. My folks got salads and I went for soup which was made fresh in house, on this evening it was classic chicken noodle. 

The only real issue we had was getting service after being seated. We were placed way up front in a booth in the corner and I think we were literal caught in an \"out of mind, out of sight\" matter. I went up to the bar to let them know it had been 20 minutes since were seated and still had not been asked for drinks or anything else. It was not very busy yet either so I couldn't really play it off as just being super busy. However after making mention to this we had a server out to our table in seconds to take drink orders and our main orders as well. 

The place is very dimly lit and makes it kinda hard to read the menu I have to say. I have 20/20 vision and I was squinting to make out the menu myself as was my dining company, nothing terrible but something we could not deny either. It took maybe 10-12 minutes from the time orders got placed to the time food started to hit out table so the kitchen works efficiently and quickly for sure.

As for food quality.....GREAT! The soups, salads steaks and sweet potato fries were all delicious! I am a fan of any place that offers up sweet potato fries as a side option so kudos to mybuddies for that! 2 of our prime ribs came out a hair smaller then the 3rd one and so our server made sure we would be brought out a 2nd prime rib if we so choose! Cant pass on that now can we!? We took him up on that in a heart beat! 

Our bill came to about $42 with drinks and a beer. Not a bad price at all for a full prime rib dinner for 3 I'd say. 

Despite my fights not being called very well for the remainder of the night, this was a positive experience and I will be coming back again soon. 

Props go out to manager Jason and our server Kane for some top notch customer service as well!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place when I first tried it, but now?  Not so much.  

They've got really reasonable prices and great burgers.  The Tex-Mex and Southwest Black Bean burgers are my favorite.  The sweet potato fries are awesome, too.  But if you're looking for good wings, look elsewhere. 

It seems like over the past few months that I've been frequenting this place, it's gotten less awesome each time.  I understand that not every server is going to be awesome, and people have their bad days.  That's fine.  But I don't like that this seems to be a regular thing.  The hosts/hostesses that have seated us the last 3 or 4 times we've been have been rude and barely said a word to us.  They act like it's the biggest chore in the world to show us our table. (Newsflash: Your job is very easy!  It doesn't hurt to smile or at least tell us our server will be with us soon before throwing the menus down and stalking off.)  The servers have been competent but not always friendly.  I don't like to be a bother and complain, but the whole thing just makes you feel kind of uneasy and a little unwelcome.  Especially if you come here off hours - right after the dinner rush or when there isn't a big game on.  

I'm giving it the 3 stars for the food and price, but the service and overall feel of the place isn't ideal anymore.  I probably won't be coming here much anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a movie tonight for some late night fare. The Bucky Book coupon got us in the door and we weren't disappointed. Maurice went into full detail of their new menu and mentioned everything is made fresh and to order! We're the only one's not at the bar and received our food quickly and piping hot! We ordered the Cajun Pasta and Chicken Parm. Both were excellent. The shrimp and sausage snapped when biting into it and the parm had a nice breaded crust on the chicken that went well with the mix of marinara and alfredo sauces! The salads were fresh and the dressings tasted homemade too! All and all a great experience! We'll be back for sure!"}
