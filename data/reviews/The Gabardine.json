{"text":"should be a 3.5. Mac and Cheese was indeed very tasty, my friend had a club sandwich and he complained about too much chicken... it looked pretty good. but i would say the price is still on the higher end for mac and cheese or a sandwich"}
{"text":"This place is completely out of character for the financial district - quirky and cozy. It's more like something you'd expect in Parkdale or Leslieville. This is a good thing, however - people who work and live in the centre want good food options, too!  The food is very good - particularly the chicken pot pie.   My only complaint is the somewhat unfriendly \"too cool for school\" service from the staff. Would it hurt to crack a smile or try to engage your customers a bit? There's one guy who's consistently nice and fantastic, but otherwise I've found it pretty surly. This is one part of trendy restaurant culture I could do without."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 4/5  Food: Portions seemed small but the creaminess of the 2 dishes made it very filling. Mac and Cheese: opted out of the smoke ham. Creamy goodness. Loved the crispy crumbs on top.  Chicken Pot Pie: Very creamy and filling. The crust on top was flaky, but doughy. Went well with all the creaminess of the pot pie. I expected it to be more meaty, but there wasn't much chicken in there. Reminded me slightly of a New England Clam Chowder.  Fish Tacos: Average, not bad, but wouldn't order again. I didn't expect much from this to begin with, since they aren't really known for this. Drinks: Expensive cocktails. $14, but they were pretty good. Easy to drink, can't taste the alcohol much. The hibiscus one was not too sweet. The deveureux one was lemony and refreshing.   Atmosphere: Cute little place. Nice ambience. Not many tables. I definitely recommend making reservations. We sat at the bar because we didn't on a Friday night, which was expected. We arrived at 6pm and got the last seats by the bar. For some reason, the place was slightly on the hotter side, temperature-wise. But I sat next to the entrance, it got chilly when people opened the door. They have a curtain to block off the draft, but it got so crowded, people were standing by the bar and around the entrance, so the curtains were pretty much useless.  Service: Took awhile for them to get us the machine to pay for the bill. We were at the bar, so they took our drink and food order pretty quickly.   Final thoughts: I would go back to try the deep fried beer cheese because I didn't even know that existed until I wrote this review and read other people's yelp.  Can definitely share the chicken pot pie and the mac and cheese with people. Might be too heavy to eat on your own."}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food in a cozy place. Craft cocktails & local beer on tap. I had the Mac & cheese with smoked ham while my daughter had the chicken pot pie. Both portions were huge!  Perfect food for a snowy night. Place is small so make a reservation. Great service"}
{"text":"All food and cocktails are delicious. The only bad thing I have to say is that they do not take reservations for lunch so by 12 pm, there is a line in front of the door. Good for a group of 2 to 4 during lunch. They do make reservations for dinner. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Even though it's on Bay St., it's a cozy place with great service and a laid-back atmosphere. You can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Looked forward to eating at The Garbadine and it did not disappoint (but avoid a window seat unless you line being bumped a lot by coming and going diners).  Menu is simple but nice and we tried all courses, each nice.  Best dishes were house made chicken pate for starter and halibut with lentils for main.  Good service - all in all a solid 4.  Expect to pay $30 - 45 per head depending on drink selection."}
{"text":"A two star rating for poor service and bland food.   We ordered  - cappuccino $4  - chicken pot pie $21 - mac & cheese with ham $22  The good thing is the portions are very large (considering the money you'll spend here). The bad thing is both the pot pie, and mac & cheese taste exactly like cream. If it wasn't for the texture difference, I would think my friend and I ordered the exact same thing.   The service was awful. The servers didn't make any effort to explain the specials of the day. We had our glasses filled once, and only because we asked. It wasn't even busy (lots of vacant tables around us) and we were handed our bill as soon as we finished eating. I noticed all the waiters just stand by the front talking with one another, and texting on their phone.   It's a cute, small place but it's just another overpriced Bay Street restaurant. I might come back to give it one more chance, but only if a friend insists."}
{"text":"I stumbled into The Gabardine in the middle of a snowstorm with a giant suitcase and two bags, dishevelled after an eight-hour flight (and about to get on another plane). No matter: the staff overlooked my general stink and quickly found me a table, even though I didn't have a reservation.  I had the warm olives and the roasted root veggie salad with arugula, burrata and blood orange. I also had a huge glass of the Sancerre. All of it was delicious. I wish I had been with a dining partner, because I left so many juicy olives behind. I also wanted to sample so much more of the menu.   The restaurant is cozy and popular, so book a reservation in advance (especially for dinner, I was told). The Gabardine serves up fresh, quality comfort food with flair for reasonable prices in the financial district. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch as I decided to treat myself to a nice lunch on an afternoon off.  When I first arrived it was absolutely packed so I went wandering around The Bay for  a few minutes and came back so I could snag a table.  The tables are pretty close together so if you're wanting to have a quiet conversation, this isn't really the place for it but the decor is cheery and kind of cute.  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and I really liked it.  I think its one of my favourite grilled cheese sandwiches in the city.  It had a great onion jam and a nice balance of cheese to bread.  Its also not that greasy so you don't feel gross after eating it.  The sandwich came with a nice little side of potato salad (with purple potatoes!) and some salad greens.    As I was on a mini vacation day, I decided to go for dessert so I ordered the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich - wow!  It was decadent and worth every extra calorie.  The service was okay - I kind of felt like I was a bit ignored - maybe because I was by myslef?  I don't know.  Anyway, the food was great and I liked the decor so I would go back."}
{"text":"A few weeks back I excitedly headed over to The Gabardine with a friend because I saw that they had chicken & waffles on their menu. I have been in search of a good chicken & waffles ever since I heard about this dish. It is essentially savoury fried chicken paired with sweet waffles and syrup, comfort food at its best.   The Gabardine offers dressed up versions of classic comfort food such as Mac and Cheese, Fried Chicken on a Cornmeal Waffle and Sirloin Cheese Burger. I am, of course, there for the chicken & waffles.  For appetizers, we were really keen on getting their Salt Cod Fritters, served with iceberg lettuce, aioli & piri piri, but unfortunately it was not available. Such a bummer. We ended up splitting the Devilled Eggs and Warm Olives. The Devilled eggs were delicious, with a very creamy filling that wasn't too heavy tasting.  For our main course, we both had the Fried Chicken on a Cornmeal Waffle. Unfortunately this was a disappointment for me. The waffle wasn't the breakfast-style waffle that I expected, as it was actually quite salty. I thought the point of the dish is to pair up sweet and savoury? I didn't love the fried chicken either. The plus side is that the chicken was extremely juicy and the coating was very crispy. It was cooked perfectly. But the coating was too thick for my liking and not as flavourful as I would have liked it to be. I personally would not come back here for their fried chicken. Total bummer.  We were offered a free dessert because the waitress moved us to a different table mid-meal. We picked the Tres leches cake to share. The dessert was great. The texture of the cake was unusual, because Tres leches cake is sponge cake soaked in three kinds of milk, giving the cake a wet texture. The flavour was great though, creamy, rich, not too sweet. It's definitely worth coming back here for.  Read more on my blog? ;)  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/07/the-gabardine_14.html"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this restaurant while searching for a place to have dessert. Both of plates were very good. The atmosphere is nice inside. The biggest trouble is the slow service. Our waitress was not very attentive, although lady behind the bar was very friendly."}
{"text":"A cozy, fun little spot with friendly service and stellar food.  Hands down the best chicken pot pie I've had in my life.  Perfectly flaky crust, rich filling and very fresh ingredients.  The Chinese bbq sandwich is excellent too.  Finally,  the Queen Elizabeth cake with coconut toffee sauce  & vanilla ice cream made my eyes roll back in my head.  Makes me wish I lived in Toronto so I could explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food never disappointed me. I most recently went again for lunch and the restaurant was bustling! Since they don't take reservations for lunch, it's pretty hard to come here during my lunch hour without knowing how long the wait would be. Luckily, I had spare time that day because even though we were sat fairly quickly, it took a really long time for the food to arrive.   We ordered the chicken pot pie and mac & cheese with smoked ham - both were very delicious. The chicken pot pie was thick and creamy, making it a perfect \"dip\" for the top crust. The mac & cheese had just the right amount of cheese and it was baked perfectly. The smoked ham was definitely the right choice and complimented the dish well - totally worth the extra $2! The portion for both dishes are huge so I wouldn't order appetizers unless you're THAT hungry.   Overall had a pleasant experience here. The server was friendly and he was apologetic about the delay in food delivery. Just don't expect the entire dining experience to be quick if the restaurant is busy."}
{"text":"Busy and active restaurant, chicken pot pie was absolutely delicious. Staff were all nice and friendly. Although price is not cheap, I was satisfied with taste and atmosphere. I'll come again to try another dish."}
{"text":"Went with some girls friends after work one night. The service was good, I called about an hour before our reservation to see if we could add one more person and they were very accommodating. We ordered the fish tacos, chicken & waffles and chicken pot pie. Everything tasted pretty good but the chicken pot pie went down as the best dish for the night. I wouldn't rush back but it's worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Tried Gabardine based on the numerous positive reviews and the restaurant lived upto its billing.      We had our infant child (in a stroller) and were unsure whether the restaurant would be accommodating; but staff were exceptionally friendly and guided us to a table in the corner which allowed us to securely park the stroller.  (We reached after peak lunch hours (2 pm) and there were a number of tables available.)  We tried the mac and cheese (yum, rich and can be shared as it gets too much for one person) and the burger (exceptional).  Our server was friendly and efficient and we would come back."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst dining experiences in a while here. I was excited to try The Gabardine as it is rated as a top 100 restaurant on the Joanne Kates list. To start I ordered the clam chowder which was great, but when I received my order of chicken and waffles as I cut into the chicken I saw that the entire piece of \"meat\" was actually just fat that was disguised by the crust around it. My friend ordered the smoked trout as her main and it was too salty to eat.   My friend has celiac disease and they would not accomodate her by changing a mains side dish to another. Allergies are like this are quite common these days and restaurants should be a bit kinder to those who have them. She said she has never had issues like this before.  Our waitress approached us after seeing our reactions to the food and was kind enough to take the fried chicken and trout off the bills.   To say the least we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"(3.5)  Had lunch in this new space today and enjoyed the surroundings. Epoxy-lacquered wood tables, white walls, patterned white tin ceiling, mis-matched dishware, and a chalkboard. This is an upscale N. American bistro with elements to make it more casual.  Got a lovely and delicious grilled cheese. I opted for the smoked ham and thought it added a nice saltiness to things, but the ham didn't come up to the front. I'm nit-picking though. This was quite satisfying. Came with mixed greens in a light vinaigrette. All very good.  For dessert, I got the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich. Nice toasty-tasting ice cream, thin chocolate cookie wafer, all sitting on a dollop of dulce de leche (yes? wasn't as sweet as caramel). Was happy to have ordered it.  Service was amiable, but I did think it odd they'd offer a London Fog on their coffee/tea menu but not be able to offer me Earl Grey as a tea selection. Space is cozy - a max of 30ish seated, and maybe 6 at the bar. Menu includes a ploughman's, mac 'n' cheese, daily soup, and more meaty options, all comfort-food. Not extensive, but a good breadth of things.  For lunch, I felt prices are pretty high, but so's rent in that area. With a cup of tea, lunch cost me $25ish, after tax, before tip. Mostly because of the addition of dessert which most people wouldn't necessarily have at lunch."}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese, as well as chicken pot pie"}
{"text":"The Gaberdine is a nice little spot in the financial district that offers hearty meals with sprinkles of originality, but without pretension. My friend and I had the mac & cheese and cheeseburger, both of which were quite good...and plentiful in portion size. Trust me, you will leave feeling stuffed. I got the mac & cheese minus the ham, which was plenty. I've gotten it with the ham before, and although it's yummy, if you're not a huge eater, it can actually be a bit too much.  The cocktail selection is nice and original, although the drinks are pricey. The beer selection is not as great. The wait staff, although friendly, could use a bit of polish. But no complaints about service overall.  The one tip I would give anyone looking to try the Gaberdine is to be aware of the fact that the place is very smelly! The ventilation is not good, which means that you will smell like a deep fryer when you emerge. Not an issue if you're heading home, but something to keep in mind if you're going back to the office afterwards or heading somewhere else after dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner here.  We phoned in  a reservation and had no problem getting a table when we arrived a bit early.  The place was a bit cramped and the low level lighting made it a bit on the dark side.  We ordered the korean wings as an appetizer, I got the special of the night which was a trout and brussel sprout side and my wife got the burger.  The quality overall of the food was outstanding.  The wings were great despite being very sticky.  My trout was really good as was the side dish but my only criticism was that it lacked seasoning.  My wife loved the burger and I agreed that the flavor was spectacular.  This is a great place for a date and a quality meal.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Since there were four of us, we made reservations for a friday night dinner. However, turns out it was a pretty quiet evening. I was hoping this wasn't an indication of the food...  My boyfriend and I were starving so we started out with the chicken liver pate - with house pickles and toasts ($7). It came with a spoonful of the pate. It came with a side of greens, pickled mushrooms, several pieces of toast and a bit of sweet marmalade. The sweetness went really well with the pate. We both really enjoyed this dish.  I went with the PEI mussels with white wine, garlic, cream and fries ($19). The mussels were cooked well and I really loved the sauce. The wine, garlic and cream are a classic combination - can't go wrong! It came with a large bowl of fries, which were perfectly crispy. A great dish.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie (must be a new item, since it wasn't on the online menu). It was fantastic! I normally don't like chicken pot pie, but I loved this. But be warned, its a really heavy dish - very creamy with large chunks of chicken in it. My boyfriend normally eats everything (and half of my meal), but he had trouble with this.  The other couple ordered the mac and cheese ($13 or $15 with ham) and the roasted brined pork with creamed polenta and vincotto ($21). They both enjoyed their dishes.  We ordered two orders of the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich ($7). One serving comes with two large triangular sandwiches. I can't imagine one person eating all of this. It was drizzled with caramel and was absolutely amazing. Perfect way to end the meal!  Overall - the food was fantastic. Everything was really enjoyable. The only thing keeping me from giving the Gabardine 5 stars is the service. Even though it wasn't very busy, our server wasn't very attentive and it was very difficult to locate him/flag him down. He just seemed very uninterested..."}
{"text":"Delicious food options, but beware of smelling like the restaurant afterwards. The fried cheese croquettes were creamy, unlike the usual plastic mozzarella cheese and came with a sweet, but not too sweet maple dip. I also had the Chinese barbeque pork sandwich which was delicious, but not quite the same taste as Chinese barbeque pork...the egg bun was far too much for the meal. Side salad, however, has a gorgeous oregano olive oil dressing."}
{"text":"Horrible service, but the food was excellent! Arrived at 11:30 to secure a table (4) for a client lunch meeting (they didn't take reservations). The clients ran late and at 12:05 I was told by our irritated server that my guests had 10 minutes to arrive or \"OUR TABLE WOULD BE TAKEN AWAY\". Our server was short, unfriendly and rarely visited our table. It took over 40 minutes for our order to be taken. I understand the restaurant was busy  but there are hardly 30 tables. We didn't receive our bill until after 2pm... It was a pretentious, unpleasant experience for a table of friendly people. We will not return."}
{"text":"This is just a review based on desserts and drinks and not on their much hyped up food!  We surprisingly got a seat right away and it was quite packed. I thought the uniforms that the workers wore was quite interesting...Jeans, farmer cloths of sort.  We ordered their Woopie Pie- Looks like a Joe Louis dessert with two cakes, and it had nuts of sort in there. I wished it had ice cream and such. The cake was kind of dry tasting, and I felt in need of drinking quite a bit of water. Tried their hot chocolate and cappucino, def needed sweetner on it. The hot chocolate was light tasting but needed a bit more of sweetness, but its okay...  Next time to try their actual meals...Seen the po boy shrimp, skate fish...Tempting!!! =)"}
{"text":"I had a friend coming into town at 10am from montreal for a meeting in the eaton center via porter airport so i texted a financial district friend for a resto reco that suited my west end style.  i got there before my friend at around 10:20am and the waitress was super friendly and sweet, gave me my pick of tables (was 30% full in there) and then alerted me the kitchen closed in 10 mins. so the kitchen staff could take a break btwn breakfast and lunch/dinner. But when my friend showed up late, she slipped in our order anyway.  I got the egg, cheese & carmelized onions panino which was on this fantastic bread and came with a small side salad. it was absolutely to die for. the cappuccino i got was also delicious. My friend got the smoothie which she raved about (she's uber picky) and just an order of toast with butter and jam but even the jam was special.   The plates were really pretty, the decor is very indie, ossington style, the staff is pleasant to look at. This definitely doesn't feel like it's in a stuffy neighborhood. All together the bill was around $25 which I think is quite standard since we both had coffee's as well. Definitely worth it. I absolutely loved this spot. Definitely a diamond in the rough (if you consider men in suits rough)."}
{"text":"I ate here on their second night open and everything was absolutely delicious. The steak frites ($23) was perfectly cooked and amazingly tender.The beet risotto and the beef stroganoff were big hits with my friends.   They also do tasty looking sandwiches, snacks, and desserts which are apparently all made in-house. I can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"The service was a solid five star. It's busy busy busy so make reservation if you are a party of more than 2.  The food was 3-4 stars in my opinion. I got the Atlantic cod and my friend got the Mac n cheese. Heck a lot of oil and mayo in the sandwich but the salad that came with it was amazing."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, but the service has been hit and miss 50% of the time I've visited this place. I think the feel of the place is great, the menu is awesome, but if I have to hope that the service will be better than the \"last time\", I'd rather not go back.   I'm big on the entire experience, not just the food when resto-hopping. You can go to hundreds of restaurants in the city and get great food, there's just more to it and I've not been won over."}
{"text":"Wow, it's been a while since I've done a review....  As soon as I entered, stumbling into the bar chairs that are inexplicably placed directly in front of the entrance, I felt like I was home. Well, if home was a ultra-trendy-hipster-themed restaurant with bar chairs in front of the entrance.  The atmosphere here is very relaxed (I mean, they are hipsters). It feels like I should be friends with everyone here... But, strangely, I'm feeling a bit of a cold shoulder from the staff. I might be projecting, though. There is a very \"Starbucks\" vibe here (stole that line from another review of another resto, forget which one).   I was here for a \"business lunch,\" even though I was dining alone (shhhh don't tell my accountant-- wait-- I am an accountant)  I wanted to try a couple different things so I ordered rillettes (memories of France :( ) and a baby greens salad. For dessert I ordered the apparently famous burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich.  Interestingly, the rillettes alone were a bit sweet. The accompanying preserved sour cherries and pickled turnip made it even sweeter. Good thing was I still liked it. Portion was small, but then again, I was spoiled in France by having huge spoonfuls of it for supper at a friend's house... Along with the amazing Loire red it was a perfect experience. But I digress.  Actually, I don't digress-- the wine list is microscopic and at the same time too focused... A non-vintage Dolcetto D'Alba, a Spanish 2001 Tempranillo La Mancha 2001, and an Ontario Meritage 2007 is all they had for single glass reds! I peeked in their wine fridge and the selection was basically that-- Italian, Spanish and mainly Ontario. Boo.  Next up was the baby green salad with \"seasonal veggies\" (heirloom tomatoes and cucumbers). I learned from the waitress that October is tomato season in Ontario (to clarify, the previous statement was written with extreme sarcasm). The salad was overdressed, but I like it that way-- how did they know?!?!? Greens were browning at the bottom (yuck), the hydroponic heirloom tomatoes tasted quite hydroponicky. However, the saving grace to the dish was a slight bitterness to the baby romaine, which I love, and creamy dressing and shaved sheep cheese were a perfect complement.  Finally, the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich. After two mini-dishes, the dessert is inexplicably gargantuan (I know I used the word \"inexplicably\" twice. That is on purpose. I demand explanations.)  The dessert is good, but not as good as the Yelp hype, and not as good as the server sold it.  Finished off with a cappuccino that had some embarrassing latte art which I pretended not to see so that I wouldn't have to be drawn into the barista's whirlpool of shame. Actually I lied-- I didn't finish with the cap, I followed that with an espresso which was also inexplicably monstrous. I ordered a double which they somehow were able to conjure into a quadruple.   Anyways, this is an OK place to go when you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket and are wearing your non-prescription clear Wayfarers and summer scarf with your ironic band t-shirt and espadrilles and feeling like savouring every single moment in life because really life is short and we should do more savouring shouldn't we. And on other non-such occasions as well."}
{"text":"The service was amazing , my friend and I had the chicken pot pie and was underwhelmed , very rich but somehow bland at the same time , there should have been peas or some type of vegetable to lighten the dish because no ingredient really stood out. It was mildly warm and a little bit too thick, it also needed some pepper and salt because the flavour was lacking. The positive about the dish was the crust it was incredible."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner - food was good, nice atmosphere.  A solid choice if you're in the downtown core and looking for a place with a casual vibe...and best to go if you're starving, as the portions are huge.   Yes, the space is rather small but not tiny...it's one of those restaurants where the tables are so close together you can hear the conversations next to you.   We had the fried beer cheese app and the beef tartare to start.  Highly recommend getting the fried beer cheese! It was gooey inside, crispy on the outside, and came with a honey/dijon dipping sauce.  Definitely addictive!  The beef tartare was ok.  Nothing bad about it...I just didn't find it to be anything special.   The chicken pot pie had a nice flaky crust, filling was piping hot, and it was huge.  Tasty.  I recommend.  The mac and cheese with smoked ham was also delicious.  The bread crumb topping was nice and crispy, and the saltiness from the ham helped balance out the richness of the dish.  Again, the portion was huge but very tasty.    For dessert, we shared the fritters which was a perfect way to end the meal.   The only minor issue we had was with the service.  It was quite busy that night, but it was pretty hard to flag down our server...or any server, and placing our orders took a while."}
{"text":"The Gabardine has just launched a new menu within the last two weeks.  Checked them out for dinner last Friday. Sampled a bunch of their new dishes. Here is what we had:  Starter: Sweet Corn Hushpuppies ($9)  super light and airy, nice corn taste. Served with a buttermilk poppyseed dressing for dipping. Delicious.  Mains: All three of us ordered something different so that we could try as many new items as possible.  Fish Tacos (from the daily specials) ($16): Two huge tacos chalk full of beautifully crispy deep fried & battered pickerel. Spiced with cumin and garnished with a lovely slaw. Served with really tasty purple and yellow baby potato salad, light creamy dill dressing. Awesome  Shrimp Po'Boy ($14): Wowzers. A huge portion for the price, larger than I anticipated. The po'boy sandwich was served on a bun similar to the type usually used for lobster rolls. Tons of battered, deep fried shimp overflowing from the open face sandwich, dressed with butter lettuce, tomato relish & and aioli. Sides include a small green salad and a portion of the potato salad (which was served with the fish tacos).  Kolapore Springs Smoked Trout Salad ($13): Not a new menu item but has been updated. The smoked trout was melt in your mouth delicious. Salad consisted of green beans, cherry tomatoes, fingerling potato crisps (great addition, added some much needed crunchy texture), olives and a remoulade.    Topped off dinner with cappuccino's & two desserts: the burnt mashmallow ice cream sandwich ($7) & the chocolate whoopie pies with dulce de leche cream and cinnamon spiced roasted peanuts ($9). The whoopie pies were good, the cake was a bit overbaked but the dulce de leche cream was the perfect filling. The ice cream sandwiches were the clear hit at the table, even though we were all pretty full we couldn't stop eating them. They use Ed's Real Scoop ice cream, rich and decadent.  In conclusion, the new menu at the Gabardine is a clear hit. Check them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner.  I had the cioppino and my buddies had the burger and another cioppino.  The ambience is great, but the food was really lacking in flavor.  We had to put a lot of salt in the cioppino and even the burger.  Drinks were good!"}
{"text":"Had the mac n cheese with the ham..of course. It was tasty but would try something else next time. The room is nice but we found it loud and sometimes hard to hear each other. We were there over dinner and it was full. The service was fantastic"}
{"text":"Depending on what mood you've caught me in, I either love or hate this place, and will either tell you I'll go back or not.  Why I'll go back:  - The food. The last time I came here I had some kind of chicken sandwich. I wish I liked the sandwich better (it was good), but I think I liked more the potato salad that came with it. I could eat a tub of that stuff.  And here's a tip: always leave room for the dessert.  Why I won't go back:  - No lunchtime reservations, and no chance of getting in without a long wait when arriving around noon.  So I have this internal battle between the feeling of frustration of rarely ever being able to get in, versus the desire to get at the yummy food that lies within. *Goes to sob in the corner*"}
{"text":"3/5. Average food. Great location. I had the club house and was not impressed. Fish pie and Mac and cheese were okay."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal, the French Martini was perfect and the service was really great! The staff were extremely friendly and I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The cappuccino is the best I ever had. The black cod is excellent. However, the portion is small to a female and it is $24.  The vegetable ricsotto is so-so. It serves like an oatmeal with some tomato. Yes, it taste like ricsotto.   Tuna sandwich is very good. Pull pork sandwich is a bit disappointed (not as good as the one in RibFest). The fries makes my friends smile.  I am not a big fan of shrimp-po sandwich tho.  The waiters and waitresses are very friendly. The shop has its character.  It is too bad that they are not open in the weekends and holidays......  It's better arrive on or before 11:45am. Otherwise, you may not have luck to find a table for lunch."}
{"text":"I should have ordered the mac and cheese - an extra star just for that.  I used to walk by The Gabardine everyday on my way to and from work.  Walking between huge skyscrapers on Bay St, you get used to the stone cold, lifeless buildings.  Garbardine seemed to stick out as an escape from the greedy corporations of the financial district.  The atmosphere appeared really comfortable, but the tables are too small and too close together for my liking.  I might as well have joined the party beside me.  The staff, while acceptably competent didn't seem that engaging or even welcoming.  When I asked for parm cheese, my server acted as though I had inconvenienced her in some way.  For dinner I had the risotto of the day featuring leeks.  It didn't have much flavour at all and the rice was on the crunchy/undone side - hence my urgent need for parm cheese!  My friend's meal fared much better.  Her mac and cheese was so creamy with a wonderful bread crumb crust and huge cubes of ham.  It just looked so cozy and warm... unlike my experience at The Garbardine.  I'm not going to be making any future plans to go, but maybe I'll revisit it if I happen to be passing by and feeling optimistic."}
{"text":"Best Mac n cheese I've ever had. Amazing! My husband's pot pie was also wonderful. It seems like a hip place with an unwritten dress code - everyone had a beard and was wearing plaid..."}
{"text":"I had heard great reviews about the mac and cheese here, and it did not disappoint! Although I'm not a chicken pot pie fan, I tried it based on the rave reviews on Yelp, and it was really good too! Our waitress was not having a good night (I asked her what kind of ham was in the mac and cheese, and she looked befuddled. \"umm.. the regular kind!\"). Kind of turned me off. But the food more than made up for it. The place was jammed on a Thursday night at 8pm. Can't really have a romantic conversation... although who has time for romance when you are happily stuffing your face!"}
{"text":"The food is great, that is, it tastes great and the portion is huge but the place need to fix their ventilation! You can see smoke coming from the kitchen and you come out smelling like their food!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner, once for lunch. It sort of an anomaly within the finance district. It has an unpretentious, rustic vibe serving comfort food.  Food has not disappointed me, eg. cod croquettes, beef tartar, chicken pot pie, Mac and cheese. Main are generously portioned. Wine list is a hit and miss. Still its a good place to hang out with friends or for couple. Its always pack but never feels loud or crowded. Without reservation, there can be a wait but they have always seated me in less than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a NYC foodie and generally dont write reviews, but last night went to Gabardine for 5th time and I REALLY want to like this place...but every time a leave a bit disappointed. The food is good, solid food, done well although last night my chicken pot pie was \"mushy\". Good attentive service and very helpful. The place has a cool vibe. BUT sometimes you need to control your patrons. The woman sitting next to me at the bar, never put her phone down, talking loudly, had her crap spread all over the bar. Totally self absorbed and obnoxious. After an hour, ask her to take it outside and sit in the cold. Even if she can't, let the rest of us enjoy the place. Oh, one more thing....youre in Toronto, it gets cold here, fix your door, it's freezing inside."}
{"text":"If you are looking for comfort food you have come to the right place!  Gabardine never fails to please when it comes to comfort-food favourites (but good luck finding something healthy on the menu).  This cute-as-a-button restaurant, with its mismatched china, cute catchphrase (\"fine grub and libations) and black and white website is located smack dab in the middle of the financial district whereas its the type of place you might expect to find queen west west somewhere.  It should be noted that they don't take resos for lunch.  I've been on several occasions and can comment on some of the food choices: - the beer croquettes are DELICIOUS as a starter, think of a moist gooey fatter-than-usual mozzerella stick; - the cod is also yummy but does tend to air on the salty side - I found the fish tacos a bit overbattered and unsatisfying - they were almost dry for some reason; - the mac and cheese is FABULOUS but if you get it, consider doing a split portion (I have never met anyone who could eat the whole thing on their own).  In terms of pricing, despite its unassuming atmosphere, a meal here can add up surprisingly fast especially if you're getting alcohol.  I'm always surprised at the wine prices (cheapest bottle of white is 34, red 42 and glasses are all around 15 and up).  It should be mentioned that the service has always been consistenly good here but in my mind, where this place excels is the ambiance - it is absolutely adorable.  Its the type of place where I want to LOVE the food more than I actually do, but its also the type of place where the ambiance is so fun that it contributes to your meal in a positive way.  All in all, its worth a trip to the Gabardine (if only to get away from the typical bay street options)."}
{"text":"Awesome little place!   (Awesome and little both being key words!).  Amazing mac & cheese.  I could have eaten 2 dishes of it.   My hubby had the bahn mi sandwich and enjoyed it, but didn't rave about it like I did with the mac & cheese.  He also had the roasted root salad to start, and although I wasn't going to have any, I'll admit that we both really enjoyed that.  The dressing was delish.  Hubby liked the beer options, because he discovered Duggan's Brewery beer, which he'd never had before.  We were disciplined and didn't have dessert, but everything looked good.     Atmosphere was quaint, cute, love the mismatched china... as others have said, it's very West Queen West, but in the Financial District.   I love the defied boundaries!  Service was okay.   Not oozing with niceties, but not rude either.  I just want some more mac & cheese........."}
{"text":"So I went to downtown to have a quick lunch with JW. We met around Bay and Queens and had no idea where to grab a quick lunch. After doing some research with the Urbanspoon app, we decided to go to a restaurant  that we never heard of. It was very close to us and had a relatively high rating, thus we decided to give it a shot.  After entering The Garbardine, I immediately got super excited because I LOVEEEE restaurants of this kind. It was like a little coffe shop around the corner with modern-country style decor. Everyone was so intimate and chatty. The atmosphere was lively. The servers were so friendly. Everything looked perfect. So lucky that we came across this restaurant.  I ordered the Shrimp po'boy sandwich, one of the two dishes that our server recommended.  I DIED. I never expected to find such a sandwich on earth. The sandwich came with a trusty combination of fried shrimps and tomato relish which highly resembled sweet and sour sauce commonly found in thai cuisine. The bread was not so hard to it took away the spotlight of the crispiness of the fried shrimps. It was like everything I love in one little sandwich, so much love in one bite. After my first bite, I already knew that I will come back to garbardine for this heavenly sandwich.  JW ordered to mac & cheese, with ham added, the other dish that our server recommended.  The melted cheese layered on top went pretty well with the macaroni covered  by a creamy, white sauce. The ham tasted a little like bacon and was fairly tendered. Overall, the mac & cheese was not as amazing as the sandwich. Also, comfort food like these tend to get a little overwhelming after a short while. JW said he probably won't order it again next time.  conclusion:  roasted.   I LOVE THE SHRIMP PO'BOY SANDWICH. Maybe just because I am a shrimp lover. However, the mac & cheese was fairly ordinary and nothing surprising. I will definitely come back for the sandwich and maybe grab a coffee to go with the whole little coffee shop/laid back atmosphere. It is noted that the food came pretty fast so prefect for those who want a quick lunch in downtown.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/02/04/the-garbardine/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"I went to The Gabardine on a Friday night and luckily arrived early since around 6, there was a bunch of people waiting. The atmosphere sort of had a home-kitchen sort of feel to it and the restaurant wasn't huge. I did like the dinnerware they used which was cute and different.  I opted for the Mac and Cheese with ham which was delicious! The dish was extremely cheesy (and I don't even like cheese!) but what made it for me was the bread crumb baked top which added a nice texture to the macaroni. I did wish I didn't order it with ham because it wasn't necessary.  My friend got the daily soup (which reminded me of tomato sauce - in a good way) and the club sandwich. He enjoyed it a lot. I had a taste of the salad that came with it which was pretty good due to the fact that there was a big hint of pickle in it. We also ordered the toutons which were warm and toasty like a warm muffin. I liked the black current sauce that came along with it but I didn't think the devon cream was necessary.  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at The Gabardine with their selection of comfort foods."}
{"text":"Lovely haven in the financial district. Wouldn't have expected to find such friendly waiters and delicious food in the area! The food was light but incredibly tasty, not the kind of place you leave feeling full and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice quiet lunch a few weeks ago... loved it!  As Vivek mentioned below, the decor and feel of the place seemed too West Queen West for a place located in the Financial District but that's probably what gave it extra points in my book. The hipness of an area we all love right in the convenience of my neighbourhood!   I went for a late lunch so it was not busy, but they got a decent amount of traffic for the hour of day (plenty of folks enjoying beers at 3pm... life is good). I ordered the portabello sandwich and my friend got the smoked trout salad. Both were delicious and reasonably priced. We also each had a tea and it came in cute cups that complemented the decor.  I wouldn't say the server was overly friendly but he was attentive nonetheless. Would definitely return for another lunch date!"}
{"text":"The drive to downtown Toronto and the half hour wait at noon for the table were all worth it. The Mac n cheese was as amazing as advertised on \"You Gotta Eat Here\".  Super friendly and efficient staff.  Got to meet the head chef too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a cute little homey place near the financial district. It is like dining in your cottage home (well a little bigger). I had the pork chop and boy it was big! I was craving protein and the dish did it all. My friend who had chicken pot pie also enjoyed the food. The portions are big and be prepared to be full. The service is ok and there are limited washrooms (one for guys and one for ladies) I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing place! like a queen west place but more trendy and in the financial core. Had the trinidadian geera pork sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. service is awesome as well and a great crowd. Definately a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food! I tried the geera sandwich and I was not disappointed. I also tried a bit of the mac & cheese and it lived up to the hype. The portions are big. Come with an appetite or share with a friend."}
{"text":"Visited on a Tuesday night for dinner and had the mac and cheese dish that everyone raves about. I did have it with the smoked ham and it was excellent although a huge portion for one person. Perhaps a little pricey ($19) for the dish but delicious. The can of diet coke for $4 seemed a bit high though.  Nice atmosphere and a good hang-out place. Staff was very friendly and appropriately attentive."}
{"text":"The place itself exudes a cozy feel with warm, \"country kitchen meets modern diner\" look if that makes any sense at all. Been a couple times now and it has been pleasant with tasty food and friendly, attentive service. The tables in the back are a bit close together but I guess that adds to the cozy charm. What stood out for me was black cod special I had and the fried chicken. Nothing crazy mind-blowing but comfort in knowing you'll have a great meal."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant. On last visit I had a rabbit charcuterie (special?) and a salad. My DC had this magnificent Bahn Mi. Service was great, space very homey.  Minus a star only for the strange hours.   must-visit."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a relaxing place for a farewell dinner when someone recommended The Garbardine. I had walked by it a few times but never really noticed it. It has a cozy little entrance and the store is quietly tucked away along the busy Bay Street. The first impression of the restaurant was that it was really casual and comfortable, although the entrance was a bit narrow because of the tables and the bar. We felt comfortable immediately and the server seated us rather quickly (we had made reservations). For a Thursday night, most tables were occupied and it was busy.   Once we were seated, we immediately ordered Mac and cheese with smoked ham, the beef tartar and the sirloin bacon cheeseburger, all to share. The beef tartar arrived first and got us really excited, the taste was just right and the portion was generous. The Mac and cheese was amazing, although it's a bit salty for my taste, when it's shared amongst three people, it was just right. Of the three dishes we ordered, the burger didn't really stand out to me, it was good but nothing that really wow me. But overall, for the price and the quality of the food, this place definitely is worth a revisit. I will be coming back here to try the highly raved chicken pot pie. Definitely a good recommendation for a causal night out with good food and nice restaurant to have good conversations."}
{"text":"Right now, my favourite locale for dinner. Given, The Gabardine lives in a neighbourhood where hip is hard to come by, which makes me love them all the more.  A quaint spot wedged in between soaring skyscrapers, this place has all the rustic homemade charm of a resto way west of Bathurst. Service is attentive, and despite making a reservation, we were surprised to see that the place was empty when we swung in at 7pm (though it did fill up by the time we left at 9).  \"Snacks\" aka \"Appetizers\" are well-priced and great to rev up our appetites as we lingered over moodily-lit conversation. Portions were extremely generous, especially with the desserts. $7/each for our toffee puddings and burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwiches were more than enough to share between 2 people.  I'll be back. Count on it."}
{"text":"We've been here before but we learn this time that if you come with no reservations during dinner time, you may have a table but you have one hour to get in and get out. We were ok as we had a game to catch but it also limits the food you can order. We were limited to the risotto and mac & cheese, we couldn't get any of the protein dishes as they take long to cook. So my friend got the mac & cheese and I had the risotto.  The mac & cheese was delicious. Hot with crispy bread crumbs on top, very tasty macaroni and cheese. I ended up eating more of my friend's dish then my own. My squash risotto was more bland, it was creamy and the rice was cooked well through but just not enough flavour. That's why I had to eat my friend's mac & cheese to get some more flavour.  After we done our dish, we were given the bill as a signal that we are to be kicked out now so they can make room for the next table."}
{"text":"I been dying to try this place FOREVER! I had the burger and it was average. A little salty. (To be fair, it was right after I had the best burger ever at Marben. Hence, it will take a lot to beat that.) :(  But I will definitely come back and try the mac and cheese (read couple of great reviews about it.)  Friendly staffs. Love the grand-mother's plates. Very shabby chic."}
{"text":"I ordered the halibut and my friend ordered the risotto. My halibut tasted good , but my friend's risotto was not worth the price. It was way too creamy and heavy. Wait is usually long. Restaurant is pretty small."}
{"text":"When walking by The Gabardine, I often think to myself, \"I wish I was eating there right now.\" Nestled in the middle of the constant construction and bustle of Bay St., The Gabardine is a small and cozy little restaurant that serves some of the best Mac n Cheese around.   That's all I really need to say, I think. It's everything a little restaurant needs to be; warm, friendly, and providing good comfort food."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pot pie. Overall Very tasty. Crust deliciously flaky. Filling inside was a bit one note. Could use perhaps a little thyme. Mom and sister had the fish special: trout, veggies, and potatoes. They raved about it. Very fresh. Definitely farm to table. Beware kitchen doesn't start serving dinner until 5pm. We were hungry after a long day of sightseeing. Waited at the Hudson Bay across the street until they opened. Only downside: didn't quite appreciate the server's attitude. she was a bit snobby. I admit, my mom can get quite befuddled when presented with complicated food options especially when hearing words like Kalmata olives, smashed fingerling potatoes, frise. I also get we were also not your typical well dressed business men/women clientele. We were just tourists passing through after reading rave reviews on yelp. But reign in the attitude chica."}
{"text":"A gem in the midst of the contemptuous financial district. Food, service, ambiance are great. The beer cheese croquettes are delicious and the mac'n'cheese is an accomplished and gratifying rendition to this childhood comfort food. Delicious desserts and great drinks are the culmination to a great night at The Gabardine.  Highly recommend. Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Great choice for dinner, close to all the downtown Toronto entertainment. We chose the fan favorites Mac & cheese with ham and the chicken pot pie. We were not let down , serving was more than enough. Service was good and accommodating as we did not have a reservation. Highly recommend a reservation. We shall return another time."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for a while as I'd heard good things. Now.. I don't often eat mac and cheese.. but from now on when I do, I will always want it eat it here. If you're gonna eat it, you may as well enjoy the cheesiest, creamiest, ooey gooiest version of it. It was very rich and heavy so I only ate half, but I know my future self will thank me for saving leftovers for tomorrow :) Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place is definitely a nice break from other establishments in the area. BUT I think this means the servers feel a little superior and somewhat \"relaxed\" about serving customers, at least at dinner time.   The food was on average just ok. I thought the cheese croquettes were a waste of money but this was countered by a strong chicken and waffle showing (although at 26 bucks this should be expected!)."}
{"text":"I finally managed to get a seat at this place and it was worth it. Had the juniper gin and tonic and the southern fried chicken sandwich. Both were amazing and service was fast and friendly. Got there at 11:30 and the place was full by 12:00. My friends had the club sandwich and the Trinidadian geera pork sandwich, both of which were reported to be good as well. I will definitely try the chicken pot pie next time. The lady at the table next to me had it and it looked phenomenal. Food was served on 'granny's fine china' which gave things a nice homemade feel. Another nice touch was the huge curtain by the door so the wind wouldn't get in. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Caught up with an old friend over lunch at the Gabardine this afternoon. This relatively new lunch spot is a welcome addition to the financial district!  We arrived at about 11:45 and had no difficulty getting a table (no lunch resos). We were warned that it would get busy and should order quickly if we were in a rush at all. Appreciated.   I had the grilled cheese with ham. It was served on a multigrain panini with caramelized onions and a tomato jam (yum!). There was enough cheese on that badboy for two sandwiches, but I'm not complaining. It was served with some mixed greens, but the pieces of lettuce were seriously massive and lacking dressing. For $14, maybe a bit much but a nice spot for a sit-down lunch.  I'm a little bummed I didn't try this marshmallow ice cream sandwich I keep reading about. Next time!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere for Bay Street options. French Bistro feel. Small, loud and lively. Feels like a NYC restaurant. Food is solid. Mac and Cheese, burger and tacos all favourites. Good breakfast spot as well but very very limited menu options."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I used to walk by the previous dive-bar which inhabited this spot,  it was a dark and dingy (don't remember the name) spot I tell you.... almost scared to venture in.   Alas, The Gabardine sets up shop.   I've been on a number of occasions since it's opening. By far no means a regular but  I've used it as a go-to spot for dinner when friends are around the area.   So last week I headed over to have a bite and some pints with a 'suit' pal who works on Bay. It was packed out but the server slid a table out and said we're welcome to sit back and dine.   I'm a big fan of their Okanagan on tap. Using this to wash down the sirloin burger of course, which was BIG. Topped with cheese, tomato, aioli, and some usual fixings. Accompanied by a side of fries which were, well, okay. But I was there for the burger.  I like the layout of the place, not too big, well decorated. Nice sized kitchen in the back which let's you see all the action if you so please.   The servers I dealt with that night were bar none pros. Attentive, friendly, and accommodating given me and my friend did not have a reservation.    It's a well-mixed crowd every time I've been. Considering you're on Bay and given the area you'd expect a room of suits. Not so much. Yeah, suits, hipsters (the Gatsby types), locals?, maybe even a tourist or two? Either way; diverse crowd. I like it.   Hands down, I'll be back."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a breakfast place in the area. Walked in, asked if they serve breakfast - yes, ok let's try it.  In a nutshell, if you want to pay $14 for a sandwich and a cup of brewed coffee, this is your place. There is not much else to say; the food was ok the staff was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary or anything that would justify the price.  I am going to keep looking for a breakfast place though."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Our family of nine came in for a late dinner on Tuesday night, an hour before closing time. For some restaurants, a large party late in the evening can put the staff in a bad mood - not here!! We had the best meal and the best service from the entire staff. Jason, our waiter, was funny and helpful and took great care of us! The food here is delicious - It;s been mentioned in other reviews, but that Macaroni and Cheese is so very very good, we all had to steal bites from the people who ordered it. My husband had a chicken sandwich, my dad had the burger, and I had the schnitzel... wow, such amazing food.   We don;t live in TO, but spend at least one weekend a month there, we will be back to the Gabardine again  and again!!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken pot. The portion size was fantastic but the filling was too overpowering. The heavy cream made it quite the challenge to finish. However, great quality pastry and overall very well done for a filling lunch."}
{"text":"Long ass wait for the food, it took 40 minutes to wait for our order. The food is good though. It's worth a wait, but not 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place - reminds me of some midscale restaurants I frequented in Brooklyn when I lived in NYC. It's got that hipster-laidback-retro vibe that's so popular these days and its reflected in the decor and the menu. Deviled eggs? Check. Old photographs? Check. Mismatched plates? Check.   Highly recommend the chicken pot pie. It's massive! Pair it with an Okanagan draft and a couple of deviled eggs, and you're set."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to restaurant in the financial district since it opened.  Restaurant is the perfect size to keep the space busy with a cozy ambiance.  Service is always very friendly and food is always spot on.  So many good comfort dishes like mac n cheese (with smoked ham) or chicken pot pie;  caesar is excellent as well with a good anchovy dressing and soft egg.  I look forward to coming here for a drink after work or grabbing a bite with friends.  The downside is that there are no reservations at lunch, which means you really have to go at 1130am if you want to be guaranteed a table.  One of the few spots in the financial district that doesn't rob you blind for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the Gabardine. The place was filled with the business lunch crowd, but the staff was accommodating and we were quickly seated.  I had the open faced tuna melt on rye with aged cheddar and it was delicious coupled with an Okanogan Pale Ale. Cozy atmosphere and attentive service considering the lunch time rush. Would recommend this restaurant for those looking to dine in the Financial District."}
{"text":"Sirloin bacon cheeseburger with aioli lettuce tomato and fries: $18. Mac and cheese breadcrust- $17 Old fashion atmosphere, 5-10min wait but beers made it fly by. We went around noon and it was a busy yet cozy setting. Burger was extremely juicy and well flavoured. Perfectly cooked. Served well done however no carbon aftertaste. First bite had a lot of beef and hammy flavour come out. Served on a china plate. Very hearty burger. Bun was flimsy and not much flavour or uniqueness to it. Cheese was sharp and well paired. Lettuce and tomato well portioned, did not overwhelm the overall taste. The meat was well marinated, perfectly cooked, and extremely filling. Bun lost its points but the china presentation made up for it. So far best traditional style burger we've tasted, but not better than the maple burger (review about that to come). Mac and cheese was amazing. Breadcrust on top of it was perfect, the cheesy sauce and macorani perfect a la dente. Very cheesy, filling but perfect for 2. Nothing needed to make this any better. Gourmet Mac and cheese at its best."}
{"text":"The Gabardine is consistently great on all counts!  Warning: no reservations at lunch and this Bay Street hot spot gets very busy! Also, they are only open from Mon to Fri (which is too bad because I would eat there on the weekends if they were open - so would other people including tourists!)   The staff are great from the bartenders, to the wait staff. For my latest dinner there I had the chicken pot pie (again). This is the best one in town, don't bother looking anywhere else. It is HUGE (by my standards), the crust is perfection and the chicken is all white meat chunks in a creamy smooth sauce. It is absolute perfection. My friend claimed her lemonade was the best one she's had this lifetime and her burger and fries were good too."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to the Gabardine for ages now.  There was a blizzard brewing outside, so it made this experience extra cozy. Nestled on Bay Street between the clock tower and the biggest bank towers in the country, the Gaberdine is a lovely place for lunch or dinner.  The menu is clean and honest modern pub food with a French / Asian accent.  There is a sea of Brooks Brother's suits accompanied by a bar of slender good-looking business women and bar flies.  The service staff are very friendly and make you feel at home.  You wouldn't expect such a great place to exist beside a Tim Horton's and 7-11. If you're looking to pick up a Bay Street investment banker or to slouch into a banquette and read the newspaper alone, this is the place.  I only ordered snacks, but I really hope to come back very soon to have one of everything else on the menu.  http://www.swallowfood.com/the-gabardine-fine-grub-and-libations/"}
{"text":"The Gabardine is always amazing, as expected. Ended up going there with two friends that allowed us to order what I call the Gab's trifecta - Mac N' cheese avec jambon, burger and chicken pot pie. Food was  consistently delicious. I had the pot pie- crust was flakey and crunchy and the inside of it was all  gooey goodness and was perfect for that cold Winter day. Staff were awesome and always a pleasure. Can't wait to return soon!"}
{"text":"Just did a take out from this fine restaurant. I had the lobster role with fries that comes with great home made ketchup. Great fast service and the consistant food quality."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 4  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  *Open for breakfast 8-10:30am *Closed on Saturday and Sunday *Don't take reso for lunch *Make sure to make reso for dinner *Canadian Comfort Food  The Gabardine is one of very few restaurants in Financial District that is known for their food, not for ridiculous price or pretentious service. It is conveniently located near the Eaton's Center which means you can get there by Subway even if you don't live in Downtown.  I dropped by on a Tuesday not expecting to wait. But boy, was I wrong! It was super busy at the restaurant filled with everyone dining in for dinner after getting off work. Thankfully I was there only with one friend so we waited about 30 minutes before we were finally seated. My point: make sure to make reso!!  Ordered: Devilled Eggs 2/5  * 4 pieces (2 eggs) of devilled eggs for $4 * I've never seen restaurants serving devilled eggs for snack/appetizer so this was new * This was just a small and simple appetizer * These were nothing special * Paprika sprinkled on top * The filling (egg yolk) was too sour for my likings * I was expecting something special but the yolk was just whipped (with something that was giving it this sour taste; mustard perhaps?) * I would not get these again  Ordered: Shrimp Po Boy 4/5  * Deep fried popcorn shrimp with butter lettuce, tomato relish and aioli on bread for $14 * Served with potato salad and greens on the side * This was a huge sandwich, served as open-sandwich * Generous amounts of deep fried shrimp  * I really liked the tomato relish on top * The sweet-sour'ness of the tomato relish really balanced out what could have been a heavy sandwich * The bread was soft and had just the right consistency to accompany all the fillings * Salad had light dressing and it went well with the sandwich * I didn't try the potato salad because I was too full * This is def worth $14 and I would get this again  Ordered: Mac & Cheese 4/5  * Mac & Cheese with breadcrumb crust for $13 * This is one of their popular menu (for lunch & dinner) * Huge portion of Mac & Cheese, served Canadian style * You can add ham for extra $2 * I got mine without the ham and it was still a lot of food * One of the creamiest and cheesiest Mac & Cheese I ever had * Loved the cheese crust on top * It is overall very rich  * This would be good to order and share with someone since it is a heavy dish * Good price for dinner, would get this again  Ordered: Burnt Marshmallow Ice Cream Sandwich 4/5  * Ice Cream Sandwich drizzled with chocolate served with berries for $7 * This is another popular item on their menu * It is a big dessert and comes in 2 huge pieces so share if you are full from your meal * This was just sweet enough as it is * I could have had it without the chocolate drizzle and it would still be good * It was a solid, good dessert to end the meal  Service was excellent at The Gabardine. Our waitress was friendly and helpful- and checked on our table couple times. It's always nice when the service feels genuine and you feel welcomed at a restaurant.  Summary: The Gabardine is the place to go if you are looking for a restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere where you can enjoy dinner without breaking your bank in a Financial District. Their food is delicious and the staff will treat you like you are a regular. I will go back to this place."}
{"text":"Like it. But so busy and difficult to get a table.   We had Mac n cheese and Shrimp Po'boy sandwich. Not a big fan of Mac n cheese becuz it's pretty heavy, but it's very creamy.  Liked Shrimp Po'boy sandwich.  By the way, didn't get the ice cream sandwich thing for dessert. For some reason, it wasn't on the menu. Ended up with pie and fried donut with chocolate Caramel sauce. Pie was ok, not sure about the other one.  Total was 54 ish. A bit pricey considering of the quality.   Loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Took me a while to get to The Gabardine given their rather eccentric hours, but I was really disappointed.  Firstly, while the male staff seemed friendly, every female we encountered was extremely cold and unfriendly.  Meal-wise, I had the candy cane beet risotto and it was awful: Tasteless, way too wet--the consistency of slop. Wasn't good at all.  My wine had a fly in it and our waitress acted indignant like it was my fault.  The only positive element to the place was the deep fried beer battered cheese croquettes in maple mustard--they were exceptionally tasty.  Alas, I won't be back to get them again."}
{"text":"I went to Gabardine on a friday night. It was really crowded, but being alone, I easily found a seat on one of the bar stools. The service was nice, considerate, and prompt, and the food was as good as promised by all the positive reviews I had read about online. I ordered the Mac'n Cheese with smoked ham, which was indulgently creamy and much better than the Kraft Dinners I had grown up eating. I wanted to order a Caesar Salad, but the waitress reminded me of their huge portion sizes, and suggested I get a plate of mixed greens which they offered but was not on the menu. The waitress was right; the mac'n cheese was huge, and as good as it was, I was still unable to finish the thing. I also ordered a side of fries. They were nicely done but extremely salty. I ended up telling the waitress about it at the end of my meal and she took the fries off my bill without me asking-as I said, very nice of her. In all it was a good experience and well worth the subway trip from uoft."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was a big YES!  + We showed up WAY early to our reservation. They had seated us in minutes. + Service was great- friendly, reasonable time, helpful. +I had deviled eggs as an appetizer, my friend had the chicken liver pate. Both were excellent. + She had chicken pot pie for the main, I had the macaroni and cheese with ham. Both were WONDERFUL. We both found them to be incredibly filling- you will not leave this restaurant hungry! We didn't have room for dessert, and I wasn't having a drink that day, so I can't comment on the drinks or desserts, but I would for sure go back, and try both!  +Small menu, and from what I hear, it's because they've perfected the items. I'd love to go on a date here. Will be back for sure!  Make reservations if you can- the place is small!"}
{"text":"I finally got into this place after getting turned away a bunch of times because it was so busy. The staff is a bit attitude-y but I'm in it for the food. It's likely the only hipsterish place in the heart of Bay St.   The mains are super rich and is usually just that dish with few sides. It's quite British influenced with menu items like chicken pot pie and the London Fog earl grey tea latte. The Chinese BBQ pork bun is actually more like a burger and my mac & cheese was pretty satisfying though I think I prefer the one at O&B. This place is popular so make reservations for dinner (they don't take reservations for lunch). They also ran out of some menu items."}
{"text":"A nice little quaint restaurant. We went there for dinner. The crowd was young and chatty, some were there for drinks and some were there for food as well. My husband and I shared the sweet pea salad on crostini for appetizer and ordered the po boy and the macaroni and cheese for our entrees. The sweet pea salad was so delicious and the combination of it with the crunchy bread and the seasoned bed of greens were amazing. The clean flavor and the different textures were my favorite aspects and I give the dish  five stars out of five. The macaroni and cheese was gooey and very cheesy looking but the taste was off. I was not a fan but my husband loved it. The po boy had the is ultra seet honey onion con Orion that I didn't like at all but once I took it off the rest was ok. We attempted to order the lemon donuts for desert but they ran out of them so we decided against getting other deserts. The service was nothing to write home about, a smile and \"how are you doing\" or even a \"hello\" could go a long way. The staff look like these hip friends who are there because they have no choice not because they wanted to be there."}
{"text":"So, truthfully, I had high expectations and intended to come here for a while.  THE GOOD: - Service! Delightful, fast, friendly, funny. - Wine - good range of options and good price - My friend's fish tacos were terrific!   THE SO SO: - My risotto was super mild - basically, no flavour at all. I was starving and scarfed it up as I really didn't want to wait for another dish, but if I was not I would have likely sent it back. Don't get the risotto is all I'm saying. - Shrimp appetizer - on the small side to split for 2 people, pretty decent but not amazing. Better as an appetizer for one. (Or maybe I was just really hungry.)  Overall I'm likely to come back, but with much more lowered expectations."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Gabardine, the service is always perfect any time of the day i go or for any occasion.   The espresso and americanos are the best in the neighborhood, not sure what type of beans they use, but they are super fresh and develop a perfect crema.  I have also been for breakfast a few times, the kitchen is truly talented, always churning out fresh and innovative comfort food specials that change daily.    I most recently had the croque madame, which was perfect: spongy and fresh bread, runny egg and just the right amount of cheese.   It's easy to miss walking on Bay, make sure you don't pass it by."}
{"text":"Gabardine is a cross of hipster meets bay street; yes it is an odd mix but it works.  It is a cozy restaurant tucked away close to the Bay & Richmond intersection.  Gabardine prides itself in upscale pub food, I was able to try their classic club sandwich.  It was good, a tab bit too much mayo.  It was accompanied with a potato salad and fresh greens.  With the potato salad, it was a bit mayo overkill.  For $12, it was decently priced.  Service was attentive. they were able to spilt the bill when we asked!    Overall, Gabardine is a unique spot to check out on Bay street if you are craving pub food."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago on a Tuesday evening and it was packed. My friends and I had to wait about 15 - 20 minutes at the bar for a table, but the wait was definitely worth it.   I tried the burger (no cheese) and fries and this was seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was gloriously juicy and beefy. The homemade 1000 island dressing was tangy and delicious. And the soft bun worked to hold everything together. The fries were quite good as well.  I can see why this place is so popular and it is a very small venue so make reservations or be prepared to wait even on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"This place is stellar on all counts. From the moment i made the reservation for dinner, the service was excellent. The atmosphere is charming. The food is amazing. This was our first time here and it most certainly won't be our last. We had the devilled eggs - best ever, Mac and cheese, fantastic.. With the ham.. And the best chicken pot pie we've ever had. Topped off with Queen Elizabeth cake which is the gooiest mess of deleshiousness.. Our waiter, sadly we forgot his name.. He is from Venezuela. Very friendly and great sense of humour, gracias amigo.   I would recommend The Gabardine to anyone who likes great food and service.   Ps. The cocktails were very good. Spiked lemonade and French martini... :)"}
{"text":"I've been here two or three times and I would rate it as just ok. The menu is a little boring in my opinion, and portions will vary based on what you order. It has a cool list of Canadian ingredients for most dishes but some items are clearly riding a financial core mark up. The Eastern European heritage in me can't help but flinch at the $28 price point for schnitzel for example."}
{"text":"I love the Gabardine! I've been twice (once for lunch and once for dinner) and had stellar service both times. The atmosphere is warm and has a ton of character. Each time I went I had to wait in line, but only for a few minutes, which I can only assume is lucky on my part as this spot always seems to be busy.  My favourite dish at The Gabardine has to be the chicken pot pie, though beware it is quite heavy! For the quality of food, and the comfortably classy atmosphere I think the prices are on point. I'm always looking for my next excuse to go!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat overhyped. Inside, it looks nice, good gastropub feel to it. The food however was a bit dissapointing. Had the Mac and Cheese with smoked ham, which was pretty good, and the chicken and waffle which was a mistake. Had an upset stomach that same night which I can only translate what came from uncooked chicken (even some of the breading was not cooked); waffles were soggy too when served. Better gastropubs can be found out west or east."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for so long and finally had a chance to drop in. The inside is a lot smaller than I imagined, but so cute and quaint. We split the caesar salad, Korean fried cauliflower, and salt and pepper fried sandwich. The salad and fried cauliflower were the standouts, so good! The fries that came with the sandwich were great too. Portions were pretty big--we had leftovers. My only criticism is my cocktail. It was average and nothing special."}
{"text":"Went here last night after seeing the other positive reviews, and was not disappointed. Great food, friendly service and really good drinks. Kentucky Pete - not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Best place for a FRI night if you're looking for a charming and cozy place with great food and drink... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Mac and cheese, great fries, good service. I was a little disappointed with the Caesar though, good flavour but small and not enough garnish. I'm too nice to give this place a 4 star because it's definitely worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"I heard the Mac & Cheese here was exceptional so I came here with high expectations. The Mac & Cheese with the ham was $20 in total, however I regret adding $2 for the ham. I saw a review on Yelp that warned me of the ham, but alas, was too foolish not to listen, since the waitress said it gives the dish a \"wholistic\" feel. Personally I thought the ham was way too salty and obstructive since it was piled on top of the Mac and cheese. Every time I had to shuffle some salty ham out of the way to access what I actually wanted to eat, and that was way more work than I wanted to put in.   The Mac & Cheese itself was worth the praise. It was smooth and cheesy, and paired well with the bread crumbs. However, I found the portion size to be overwhelmingly large since it was so heavy. About a 3rd in, I felt like I had to stop. Luckily my boyfriend gave me words of encouragement, and helped me eat half of it. This dish would be much better served in half the portion size, and without the ham (I would've preferred a pig plushy and a bowl of salt)."}
{"text":"My main man @Vivek S. reviewed this place, so when a friend suggested we meet here for after work drinks I was all over it. And man, I was not disappointed,  It's a strange location in many ways - across from the humdrum of Bay just below Queen. It seems like a more likely location for a Subway Sandwiches than home to wheelers and dealers. The decor is fantastic. A warm, neoclassic look. The waiters are all very friendly and well versed in the food and drink. And that food and drink? Fantastic.  To start we had a plate of olives - which were oddly warm (on purpose) - but still delicious. We had a pint and talked at the bar which is a fantastic spot to look over the other 12 or 15 tables and watch the kitchen work away in the back. My friend ordered the club which he had with salad (IDIOT!) and which was satisfying. The chicken was moist and the bacon well-cooked. The salad had a nice vinaigrette which he enthused about. But all his words were wind compared to my burger. HOT DAMN that's a fine burger! Perhaps the best I've had in the city? Could be... So juicy, yet the fresh bun had the structural integrity to hold together. Slathered in cheese and bacon this was an absolute delight. Words are failing me - I wish I just had a GIFF of Homer drooling over the Gummy Venus De Milo. Oh, and the fries? Amazing too.  I picked up the bill - whoops - and the damage was a bit steep. This IS Bay Street after all, and I suspect that Gab's takes advantage of lots of folks throwing down expense account cards. So it's a bit steep for us mere mortals, but still pretty worth it. The burger was one of those things I want to ask for for my birthday. That, the great atmosphere and genial attitude of staff makes it a no-brainer for lunches of any kind; classy, friendly, whatever.   All in all a great place - heavily recommended."}
{"text":"Place is pretty electric, small spot with a line coming out the door for lunch. Menu is pretty refined and the service is excellent. If you drop in and say you heard about them through Yelp, they may just give you a free order of cheese croquettes! (which are to die for)"}
{"text":"I will be honest. After reading these reviews, I was kind of expecting a lot. I guess I shouldn't have, because my experience didn't end up meeting expectations.  Let's start with what was good: The service was really great! Our server tried to find us a table and when she couldn't, she offered us seats at the bar. She kept our water refilled at almost all times -- it was like our cups had infinite water or something!   The roasted marshmallow ice cream sandwich. Yummeh. I think it's hard to go wrong with ice cream sandwiches but roasted marshmallow ice cream is just a totally swell idea. :)  Really pretty plates. Flowery and very catching.   The bad: Had the daily bruschetta which had sundried tomato, basil and cheese on bread crisps. WAY too salty. Really small portion for the price.   The server told us about the specials, and my girlfriend ordered one of them. Heinously small portion (that didn't even make my girlfriend full, and she doesn't even eat that much...) for $20? Also, it was aesthetically unpleasing. I've uploaded a photo to show you all what it looks like. NOTE: My camera is not the best, but I think you can get the gist of it from my picture.  The so-so: had my first mac and cheese in a long time here. Nice portion (which I shared with my gf to sate her hunger...), filling, hearty, simple good food. I think it's a little difficult to mess up mac and cheese, but this was nothing to write home about either.  All in all I kinda think this place may be just a little too expensive for what they're offering. You can see my full review on my food blog, located conveniently in my profile. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto every other week on business and I always try to find a few go to restaurants; Gabardine is one of those. Food is awesome especially the Brine Pork Chop and the Cesar to start. They've got seating at the bar when alone and a great place for business lunches. Priced right, great food and everyone working at Gabardine is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Has it ever happened that you felt the vibe of a place all the way out on the street and it stopped you in your tracks?  The Gaberdine has that vibe--an upbeat, happy satisfaction that trumpets out the front door.  My buddy and I were wandering for food on a business trip in Toronto and stumbled upon this absolute delight of a restaurant.  As we poked our head in, a waitress read our minds and asked, \"Would you like to see the menu?\". Of course!  We immediately found ourselves perusing an array of upscale comfort food at quite reasonable prices.  The smoked trout gravlax appetizer was perfectly balanced with horseradish crème fresh, country mustard, and pickled cucumber slices. The chef had pickled the cucumbers very lightly and with a bit of sweetness to beautifully contrast the delicate but smoky trout.  This dish let me know I was in for a good ride!  Listening to the specials, it became clear this is a kitchen that cares about its ingredients.  The pulled lamb was served in home-made pita, and the fish tacos I selected were served on home made corn tortillas.  Having grown up in Southern California, I care deeply about my tortillas, and these were excellent.  But those fish tacos were so much more!  Two tacos were served on a plank, separated by a mound of potato salad.  The fish was panko crusted and deep fried (cod, I believe) and served with an avocado purée and green chili salsa.  The red cabbage slaw was incredibly crisp allowing the tacos to satisfy all five senses--touch, sight, smell, taste, and SOUND!  Amazingly, it was the potato salad that won the day.  Our waitress made sure we tried them because it \"made her sad\" to see other patrons leaving it untouched.  The red potatoes were cooked to a silken consistency that was still firm enough to hold its shape and not fall apart on the fork.  How do you do that???  The dressing was subtle and delicious.  I will remember those potatoes for years to come.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely go back if I ever return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends. We asked to view the menu before we were seated so that we can decide whether to eat there or not, at the waitress was pretty snooty about giving it to us. Anyway, we ended up grabbing a table. I ordered the chicken pot pie. The inside of my chicken pot pie was very soupy, a lot more watery than I am used to. However it tasted great! The crust was very crisp. It was a little on the pricy side though, especially since the food was pretty average."}
{"text":"I'm not from Toronto so I found the drinks and food a little pricey, but worth it. We had the fish tacos, which were light but so fulll of flavour! And the Mac and cheese with ham, and calling it just plain old Mac and cheese with ham seemed understated, as it was also very very good, lots of cheese, light bread crumbs and big cubes of real ham! Would return again, but there was a lot of things on the menu I'd probably never eat hah. Service was nice too!"}
{"text":"The hypster / antique / modern fusion decor definitely paralelled the diverse and original menu. The chicken pate accompanied with the apple butter was unique tasting and a good starter. The sirloin burger had more than copious amounts of sauce, such that my plate was an artist palate of mayonnaise and burger grease the moment i picked it off the plate. The game flavor of the burger was excellent however proportions were far from ideal in terms of sauce, meat and bun. Overall a nice restaurant with above average food. Go here for a changeup in your everyday cuisine, but dont excpect to be blown away. Four stars."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Great cocktails.  Often a long wait for a tiny table. But oh well.  If you're not ordering the beer cheese, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Really tasty comfort food and good beer on tap. I had a soup to start and got their burger as my main. The burger was delicious and I would get it again. A touch on the pricey side, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch on a Wednesday and I'm so glad my friend recommended this restaurant.  The Gabardine feels like a Queen West hipster restaurant but with the business crowd found on Bay St. The place was packed by 12pm so if you're coming for a weekday lunch make sure to arrive slightly earlier. There was soothing music on and Edison lightbulbs above. A very cozy place but does get loud when the crowd come in for lunch.  Staff here were amazing. Our water was never empty and our waitress checked up on us several times and told us about the daily specials before ordering.  The food was amazing. I got the sirloin bacon cheeseburger and it was just full of flavour. The price is on par with most lunch restaurants in downtown Toronto.  I'll definitely be back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"It's 4 pm in the screening and they are not serving anymore food. Why bother be open if you are a restaurant. Doesn't matter how good the reviews are if yoy can't serve when you are open."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not exceptional.  The wait staff was competent, but not particularly  friendly."}
{"text":"in a sea of suits  Gigi and I made plans to meet up. As per usual, we had a long wishlist. I left it to her to narrow down the list.  The Gabardine won the draw, but we were the ones who got lucky.  A lot has been said about this place already. I agree that it doesn't really fit on Bay Street. It's a welcome change from the usual watering holes. From the moment I walked it, I forgot where I was. It reminds me of something I might find in Montreal; a comfortable clean space with white walls, framed images and antique-y hanging lights.   It's a bit crowded in the front given the bar area, but the dining tables weren't as cramped as some critics have made it out to be.  At the risk of sounding like a superfan, I loved this place. It was warm and welcoming, and the service was spectacular. I'll say that again, because I don't get to say it often - spectacular.  Our server anticipated needs, knew the food, was friendly and attentive, and aware of his surroudings (i.e. knew when to engage and knew when to be invisible) - basically, a bonafide superstar.  Gabardine's menu includes a wide range of unpretentious food like grilled cheese, sirloin bacon cheeseburger, and chicken pot pie.  They say come in and get fed, well, Gigi and I are really full:  We shared some fries (of course) and the sweet corn hushpuppies with buttermilk poppy seed dressing ($9).  The hushpuppies were perfectly fried, moist and buttery.  I loved the mismatched plates, \"Grandma's china\" as Gigi said.  She had the black cod with braised lentils and mushrooms ($24). For those of you that know a little about me, you know I love black cod. One of my favourites is at Blue Water in Vancouver. The Gabardine's is a contender. It was really, really good. Delicate and delicious:  I had the shrimp po'boy with butter lettuce, tomato relish and aioli ($14). I'm a sucker for po'boys. It was really good. The bun/baguette was the way fresh bread should be - crispy outside, soft middle.   We finished with the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich ($7). I wanted to love it, but I ended up liking it. I wasn't too crazy about the sandwich part. I may have been hoping for a graham cookie, but then again, I'm thinking s'mores. Now there's an idea.  It really was fine grub.  Note 1: Based on service alone, I'd give this a rating of \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" Note 2: Smaller restaurants with an open kitchen make for eau du restaurant.  We left smelling like food."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch last week, it's very busy!! We were seated pretty quick, seems like most people are in and out during the lunch rush anyway.  We really enjoyed the food! The club comes off more as a chicken salad sandwich with bacon! Yum!! The bread was delicious and buttery! We also had the fish po'boy which was a little on the greasy side... But I guess that happens when you order a fried fish sandwich. But I loved the sauce on it!! Wow!! The icebox pumpkin cheese cake had great textures crunchy, creamy & moist, the presentation was very rustic!    Over all a great lunch, I give this place a 4.25/5 stars we had 2 servers, one was very nice- kind, caring and knowledgable and the other was a little on the rude side... Kinda cold, not friendly and just didn't seem happy to be serving us, which is part of the experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! We order cheese balls for appetizers. Something new!   I had the chicken sandwich. Phenomenal!  Reminded me of the southern fried food I miss so much.   Service was great considering it was Thursday night and the place was packed.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We finally managed to get a table on a walk-in on a tuesday night and I am so glad we did. This place lived up to all the hype and then some. The staff was friendly and very accommodating and the restaurant had a very relaxed feel that is so rare on Bay street. The food is the prefect comfort food that soothes the soul bumped up just a notch. I had a glass of the wonderful Caesar sans alcohol and it was strong, pungent and held its own.  My SO ordered the seafood stew which I thought might be too creamy but it wasn't. It was a perfect balance of stewiness and seasonings allowing the seafood to be the star. I had the po'boy and could not finish it. The shrimp was perfectly friend and seasoned but what makes this sandwich is the relish on it. - absolutely the best.  The burnt marshmallow icrecream sandwich was a perfect finish to a fun evening - one that I intend to replicate over and over again. Thank god I work across the street!!"}
{"text":"I visited with one thing on my mind - The Gaberdine burger. Listed on Toronto Life's top 25 burger list, around 20th place. I think it should definitely rank higher after trying most of the burgers on this list.    We arrived just after the lunch rush on a Thursday so we didn't need to wait (no lunch reservations). Service was polite and efficient.  Let's get right to it - the Burger was delicious. Probably sits around 5th place on my Toronto Burger list. Easily the largest burger on my \"top 5\" list. I was stuffed as I ate the last bite. The burger is $18 - the going rate for gourmet non-fast food burgers.  The burger patty is made from ground sirloin and cooked a little more than most gourmet burgers - I would say slightly more than medium on my visit. The burger is very rich as it includes bacon, cheese and a thick aioli topping. Warning - this is hands down the juiciest burger, the juicy goodness will leak all over your hands and shirt if your not careful (good thing I had my tide stick). The bun is neither a plus or negative - a basic egg bun with sesame seeds on top.  The fries that accompany the burger were very enjoyable. They were cooked with fresh rosemary and a have a real unique flavour. A nice change of pace.  As I looked around the restaurant, a few dishes clearly stood out. The Mac & Cheese looked heavenly and the Club sandwich was immediately added to my must try list.  They had 3-4 craft beers on tap and good wine selection.   I will be back for again soon to try the mac/cheese and or club sandwich.   BK"}
{"text":"I visited the Gabardine on a Thursday night for dinner, around 5:30pm. It is very highly recommended that you make reservations before you go because this place gets full quick. Its a pretty tiny place, with mostly tables for 2. I normally prefer having a little more elbow room when I dine out though, especially in the winter time when coats and bags taking up so much space.  After perusing Yelp as I normally do before trying a new place, I decided that the Yelpers unanimously voted the mac and cheese as being one of the best dishes to try here. So that's what I got. Turnaround time was pretty quick and the food arrived in around 10 minutes.   THE MAC AND CHEESE WAS GOOD GUYS**  **It was very heavy though, so heavy that I had to take a break halfway through to let my stomach settle a little. Normally, I'm the kind of girl that always needs a side to go with her food, either hot sauce or veggies or something. Just something that introduces a little variety so I don't need to take the same bite one after another. But in this instance, I was okay. The mac and cheese was seasoned well and the herb breading added some nice textural contrast too.   My only quip about Gabardine is that the vegetarian options were limited. I know the menu is small, and that's fine, but I like eating at places where I'm not limited to 1-2 options. I've heard the menu rotates by season so I'd be interested in checking out the Gabardine again during the spring/summer."}
{"text":"Visited The Gabardine for the first time while attending TIFF. It's got a great spot in the downtown core, although, unfortunately for them there is scaffolding covering the large windows into their well-decorated interior.   The food was all excellent. Every bite was filled with flavour, whether it was the crust of the chicken pot pie or the fries. The menu is very diverse with dishes from all corners of the world. Reflects Toronto well. The prices are very reasonable for its location.  The service was prompt, polite and professional. Reservations for dinner were easy to make and, most importantly, kept. The only downside I found was that drink prices, especially draft beers, were much higher than nearby establishments.   Would I go there again? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Fresh flavours and excellent service describes the Gabardine.  Made a reservation for a Monday evening dinner. Restaurant was still quite busy with several tables taken already.  We ordered the Philly Cheesesteak ($15) - tender and flavourful meat on soft bread, layered with provolone - and the Fish Tacos ($16) -  fresh Pickerel topped with a citrus type slaw.   Both dishes arrived quickly. Beer and wine selection also pleasing.   For dessert, we ordered the Tres Leche Cake ($9). HIghlight was the toasted coconut!   We plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Cozy tables, can definitely follow the neighbors conversations.  Food was solid, so was the service.  Dessert was very good."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim with my cousin in a Thursday night. It was pretty busy but they had a no show so we got seated right away. I loved the atmosphere inside. It was dimly lit and not very pretentious, especially for a place in the financial district. It definitely is a nice spot to take a date. The menu isn't insanely extensive but I'm also a non seafood and pork eater. I got the mac and cheese of course and my cousin got the fried chicken sandwich. I also got a 5oz of the white cuvee which was very delicious and not overly sweet.  My mac and cheese was in a fairly good size ramkin dish. It was very hot and gooey and covered in breadcrumbs which is how i like it. I did still feel a bit hungry though. My cousin's burger was so yummy. Definitely not your kfc fried chicken! I would try that again. The fries had a rosemary flavoring to it and i could have had buckets of it to myself. Such a winner this place was. It isn't the cheapest but i think my money was well spent. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Not a big place, cozy seating right downtown. Friendly, laid back staff. Not cheap though!  Husband had the fried chicken with waffles and I had the BBQ pork sandwich. Both are delicious .... Wouldn't be a health conscious meal at all though.   Fries are great too!  The pulled pork sandwich had a bit too much sweet BBQ sauce in it. Otherwise, I was happy with it.  Bill for 2 came to over $70.  Walked in on a Wednesday night, 20 minute wait. Downtown work crowd.  People in business clothes, a couple chanel bags...."}
{"text":"I had exactly one drink at The Gabardine, but it was a lovely drink and a lovely spot. I'd definitely go back if I lived in Toronto, and not, say, thousands of miles away in another country.  I went with a new friend during a conference at the Sheraton, and wanted to get off campus for a drink, mostly to avoid the sad hectic atmosphere of the lobby bar. The Gabardine was a cute place a quick walk away, and it was blessedly quiet when we went in, at around 4 on a Friday afternoon. No happy hour, which may have accounted for the near emptiness.  The Gabardine is a restaurant, but the kitchen was closed between lunch and dinner, which worked for us just fine. It was a small, charming place, neatly decorated with lots of white paint and hanging lights. We sidled up to the cozy curved bar near the entrance and had a leisurely round of drinks.  There was a full bar, with a few draft beers and a half dozen cocktail on the menu. I got the Classic Caesar, which is apparently Canada's version of a Bloody Mary, made with Clamato, vodka, and Bloody Mary fixings--in this case, horseradish and pickled pearl onion, olive, and cornichon, with a seasoned salt rim. This was satisfying, briny and flavorful with a bit of heat, and I particularly liked the fresh horseradish. The bartender was friendly, and she did a great job mixing my drink.  If I'd had more time in Toronto, I might've gone back to check out the food at Gabardine. It was a sweet little place, with pleasant service and atmosphere, and I enjoyed my clammy Canadian Mary."}
{"text":"This place is highly overrated! Greasy unhealthy food which I love but not that much better than other Greasy unhealthy food joints.   Came back here for a second time because it wasn't that memorable the first time so thought it was my fault. this time ordered the Pot Pie and the burger.  Burger is nice and juicy but fries were undercook inside for my liking. And the Pot pie was good but highly overrated.   Service wasn't that good as I waited and waited for a refill and then had to ask the staff.  Food 3.0/5 Service 2.0/5 Ambiance 2.5/5 Value 2.0/5  =========  Overall 2.4/5"}
{"text":"Went to Gabardine yesterday after the lunch rush was over and was surprisingly impressed by the food. A bit expensive but nothing out of the norm for Bay St. Nice little establishment with friendly staff. I had the chicken pot pie which definitely hit the spot! Hubby had the fish tacos which were fresh, crispy and very flavourful. We had a latte to top off the meal which was also good. My only issue was the wait time. I felt like it took forever to get our food! Maybe about 30 minutes and I was ready to eat anything by that point. Apart from the long wait time, we were satisfied. We will definitely be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner based on the fabulous reviews that we found here and elsewhere. We arrived around 7 with no reservations but we able to be seated within about 15 minutes (it was a Monday).  We had the beer cheese croquettes for an app, I had the chicken pot pie and the husband had the chicken and waffles, all based on the reviews we've seen. They were all.....fine. Nothing bad - my pot pie filling could have used more flavour, but it was fine.  Fine is the best word here. Nothing bad about it, but considering the rave reviews we read and heard about this place, we expected so much more. We wouldn't necessarily come back when there are so many other options downtown."}
{"text":"Nice place. I really enjoy restaurants that try to use local foods. A small, cool place that got crowded as the evening progressed. There are ten chairs at the small, L-shaped bar and at least one large \"group\" table by the window. The prices seem a bit steep but it was all good. I ordered a cocktail, the Kentucky something! and that was good. I had that with the risotto special with squash, pumpkin and sage. The rice was cooked perfectly. My colleague had the sirloin burger. That was huge. He enjoyed it. If it weren't for the giant crowd at the entrance pushing on the bar chairs, it would have been nicer. Something needs to be done with that area. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Smaller than I expected, yet very cozy and welcoming!  We ordered the chicken pie, mussels and fries.. highly recommend both dishes.. it feels like my grandmas food (I mean it in a very positive way) made with care and love the waitress was quick, friendly, attentive and efficient !you can see the kitchen which is nice but at the same time will leave this restaurant smelling like food, which is annoying!  Would definitely recommend it! And also hope they bring back the fried chicken and waffles dish!"}
{"text":"Good price, tasty hearty food. Won't be my last time!! Try the Mac'n'cheese delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness! That mac n' cheese with the smoked ham! It's huge and really hit the spot. Thick, creamy and super cheesy. The smoked ham was piled high. Without it, the mac n' cheese would have gotten boring pretty quick, as delicious as it is on its own. We also had devilled eggs. Combined with the fun, classy and girl cocktails, we had a great time! It was still pretty busy on a Friday evening in the Financial District, though we were able to get seats at the bar right away."}
{"text":"We got lucky our first night in Toronto and had the pleasure to dine here. I really was impressed by the taste of the food and the portion sizes.  We ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and it didn't have much flavor to it.  I ordered the brined grilled pork chop and I enjoyed it. It was actually too much food. My mustard greens were delicious and I enjoyed the slightly sweet sauce around the edges of my plate. My beans were a little under-cooked, but all in all, it was a great meal.  My friend ordered the mac and cheese and it made me want to slap the entire kitchen staff, that is how good it was.  I was dreaming about that mac and cheese and I can't wait to visit Toronto again so that I can have some more of Gabardines!"}
{"text":"had their daily special - catch of the day, seafood stew was flavourful but could benefit more with a thicker sauce. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Decor/Vibe: 7/10 The place is nicely decorated, elegant, and modern. The booth seats are comfy. The place don't really have much room for people to wait at front. The restaurant was busy for a Wednesday evening. It looked like most of the business crowd was here for dinner and it was packed. Make reservations if you plan to eat here or be prepared to wait.   Service: 7.5/10 The server was friendly and our food came out quickly. The rest of the staff seemed friendly too.  Main: 8/10 For appetizers we ordered the beer croquet. This was good it was crunchy and cheesy. The beer flavor was noticeable and added a unique flavor to the app. I decided to try to Mac and Cheese after reading about in on the reviews here. The mac and cheese is delicious. The dish was creamy, rich, and decadent. This is a good enough portion for 2 people. The sauce had great cheesy flavour, and the bread added a nice crunchy textural element to the dish. I think if the dish came with a small side salad, it would be good just to get a relief from the richness of the dish. I also tried to fish taco dish. The fish was tasty and cooked well, but I've had better fish tacos elsewhere.  Dessert: 2/10  I heard so many good things about their dessert, but I was disappointed. I even made sure not to eat too much to have room for dessert. I ordered the whoopie pie, cookie dough pie. This tasted more like a cookie to me and was really small. I asked for a substitution of ice cream instead of the cream. For $3 extra I got 2 tiny little scoops of vanilla ice cream that wasn't very good. The price is not worth it. I can go to other places to get better dessert that is not as pricey.  I'd be back to try their other mains, but not the dessert."}
{"text":"Such a huge fan of this restaurant!  Very cute interior -- grabbed seats at the bar.  We were served promptly and the food was awesome!  We were in and out in half an hour.  Both of us had salads and they were delicious with the most tasty ingredients.  The goat cheese in my salad was extremely good -- smokey flavour with a good texture.  Walnuts, pears, goat cheese and buttermilk dressing on red leaf lettuce.    My friend had the root salad and it looked really good and she was happy.  We also had some alcoholic beverages that were wonderful.  I also came here previously in June 2011 and was equally as impressed.  The deviled eggs are a definite must and the desserts are to die for.  My only complaint is that they are not open on weekends!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for awhile and the opportunity finally came up with some friends.  We spent a Wednesday night having dinner after work at this restaurant.  I'm an instant fan of The Gabardine.  Our night out wasn't perfect but it was pretty close.  First, the bad to be aware of - yes, it's small so you may wait for a table (not sure if they take reservations).  I love the cozy atmosphere but that means waiting for a table.  The other negative about this place is the drinks are a little pricey ($14 cocktails? $9 draft beer?).  It is in the financial district of Toronto but those are both a couple dollars above competing restaurants in the area.  Now - the good.  And I mean GOOD.  The food - it's excellent.  Every single person raved about their meal.  I shared three items with friends - the hamburger which was very tasty, the mac and cheese which was phenomenal and the chicken pot pie, my least favorite but still good.  I thought the under $20 pricelist for all of these items was a good deal as well - the portions were pretty generous.  Overall - we had a great time here and I would love to go back.  I've also been recommending it like crazy to my friends since we were there.."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Tuesday at 5:30pm before a Leafs game but I wasn't too impressed.  Seating is pretty limited, as it's a fairly small place.  The atmosphere was that of a casual but upscale bar.  Unfortunately, my table and dining space was so small, I was almost bumping elbows with the person beside me.  I got the chicken pot pie but had to wait about 25 min.  I will admit that it was worth the wait because it was delicious!  It's pretty heavy but so very creamy and full of flavour.  The chicken was incredibly moist and the pastry was flaky and delicious.  I was a bit disappointed that it doesn't come with any sides but it was filling enough for a dinner.  The big con was the price.  The chicken pot pie was $20 and a can of Coke was $4.  I wanted to get the soup as well but was not going to pay $9 for it.  Overall, I had a delicious dinner but felt I paid too much for what I got, and I had to rub elbows with my neighbour."}
{"text":"Another month, another dining group meeting - and this month was my turn to choose the restaurant!  I've been curious about this place for a while, and it didn't disappoint.  Our reservation was at 6:30, and I'm glad it was because when we arrived there was a sign on the door that the restaurant had to close at 8 due to city work.  The server explained and was apologetic, but apparently they had only been told the day before.  We actually left after 8 though, so they definitely didn't rush us out.   Between us, the orders were shrimp po'boy, Caplansky's smoked meat, pulled pork, and mac n cheese.  All looked fantastic, although I can only speak to my po'boy.  The shrimp were very flavourful, and generously portioned on a fresh bun.  The tomato relish was a nice sweet accompaniment to the saltiness of the shrimp - they were a little too salty on their own, but within the sandwich it worked nicely.  My only complaint about this sandwich, and it's not much of one, was that it was a little difficult to eat it gracefully.  The aioli oozed, some of the shrimps popped out (one actually rolled down my arm onto the floor!)...but it wasn't enough to negatively affect the experience.  A friend and I decided to split the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich - and it's a good thing we were sharing because it was huge!  It was a little difficult to get the fork into because it so solid, but it was very tasty.  It didn't blow me away like it seems to have for other people though.    I really liked the décor, it was cozy and country - even down to the mismatched patterned plates!  I enjoyed it.  It's a medium-sized restaurant, and it was pretty loud.  The server was very friendly, but we couldn't understand the wait on our bills.  Long after we'd finished dessert, we could see him at the bar polishing glasses.  Due to the volume and the fact that his back was to us, we couldn't get his attention.  When he did get our bills, he didn't give us any problems with splitting them which we appreciated, although he told us that he couldn't split the dessert - no problem for us.    All in all, fun décor, good food, decent prices, and pretty good service - I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie is legit awesome. As other reviewers have commented, the pastry crust was done quite perfectly. The pie was huge and loaded with chicken pieces, and the creamy sauce it was in was delicious. I wouldn't have minded having more veggies in the pie!  Mac and cheese was good too, but I found it to be too salty for my liking. The cheese was nice and stretchy, and the crunchy top was a nice touch. Not sure though if it's worth the price point. We had the ham added on, and I actually preferred eating the mac and cheese without the ham.  Atmosphere was nice and cozy, and location is sweet. Would definitely recommend the chicken pot pie!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing when you need the ultimate comfort food!!!  It's so cozy and warm, and the service is impeccable! We were greeted right away by the bartender, and then sat at a table where we were served by Adrian. Adrian was so welcoming and inviting.  We had the fried cauliflower, liver paté, and the gnocchi to start and all were delicious!! We then had the veggie burger (which was so tasty), regular cheeseburger... OMG!!!! , and the Korean fried chicken thigh sandwich... The sauce was so rich and incredible. Ultimately- this place is my go to for a comfort food binge night.  Their macaroni and cheese is dangerously delicious!"}
{"text":"Walked by this cute restaurant so many times and decided to finally give it a shot. Surprisingly, it was really tiny, with very limited seating, and it was really packed for a Tuesday night. The Gabardine has a very cozy and warm atmosphere, with a lot of chatter going on in the background.   I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie after reading all the other Yelp reviews and it was so amazing! The portions were huge, and the crust was so crisp and baked to perfection. Although a little bit heavy, they really didn't cheap out on the chicken bits inside and it was possibly one of the best Chicken Pot Pies I've ever had. My friend ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger over the Mac and Cheese w/ Smoked Ham based off of the waiter's recommendation. It definitely did not disappoint!   Prices were a little bit higher than I had expected, but the quality of the food was worth it. Service was good, like everyone else promised -- but the waiter wasn't much of the social type (not that I minded). Very straightforward, got to the point, kept it short and sweet. Would I change anything? Maybe expand the food options, add some more mains, and diversify the lunch and dinner menus a bit. Other than that I'll be back again to try the Mac and Cheese and I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a new restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant you go to on a Friday, when it's been a long week and you need to treat yo'self with something heavy to get you into weekend mode.  I have only had the mac and cheese here; which came highly recommended by coworkers. It's one of the best mac and cheeses I've had *with the smoked ham*. It's creamy, cheesy, with a bit of a breadcrumb crust on top. The price point is high for mac and cheese, but because it's so rich and heavy, I've only ever been able to finish half and I take the other half home. I guess that makes two meals in one.  The restaurant itself is very small;if you're trying to snag a table for lunch go at 11:30 am, otherwise you'll likely be waiting for a spot. Service is OK, not particularly friendly but our glasses are always filled with water, and our bill comes quickly.   As long as you're OK with food comas, I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love The Garbardine. The cozy atmosphere, good music and a quick 2 minute walk from my condo had this place heading for 5 stars.   We went on a Thursday evening and it was busy; thankfully we had a reservation. My friend and I both ordered the Mac and cheese. After reading raving reviews on yelp, it was a must try!  The Mac and cheese had a nice brown crust and was very creamy. I was disappointed that there wasn't much cheese or any flavour - it tasted like cream. The addition of \"smoked\" ham didn't help either as it was also flavourless. It was altogether bland.  I'll come back if I'm looking for a cozy place to get a drink, but I won't be ordering any overpriced, bland food."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've ever had!  The food was good from beginning to end with appetizer and finishing off with dessert.  I had heard a lot about The Gabardine and especially for their mac and cheese (and chicken pot pies as well).    There were a lot of people there already and dining and drinking on a Monday evening.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The Korean Fried Cauliflower arrived first.  This was a small plate with sweet gochujang, Japanese style mayo and nori.  It was a really good appetizer!  The flavours were strong and I enjoyed it smothered all over the fried yet soft cauliflower.  So many restaurants serve savory cauliflower nowadays.  The Mac n' Cheese came with herbed breadcrumb crust.  For $2, you could add smoked ham to it and I was so glad that we did so!  (If you come here, you have to add the smoked ham to it as well.)  The Mac n' Cheese was a beautiful portion of macaroni and cheese.  It was seriously the best Mac n' Cheese I've ever had!  The cheese was so flavourful and creamy and coated the macaroni perfectly.  The tender cubes of generous smoked ham just added perfectly to the flavours.  I was in foodie heaven.  I couldn't believe how delicious the Mac n' Cheese was!   The Chicken Pot Pie also had a herbed pastry crust.  This was served to us steaming hot.  This was a very heavy and rich chicken pot pie.  It was very creamy inside and quite good too!  The two mains that we ordered were both very heavy and carb-heavy.  However, it was so worth it because that Mac n' Cheese dish was the absolute best!  We packed up our leftovers of the mains and ordered dessert too.  We ordered the Peanut Butter Frozen Custard.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm not a big peanut butter fan.  Despite that though (and especially because of that), I found this dish to be so, so good -- and you know that says a lot for a non-peanut butter lover!   It had chocolate crumb, an espresso ganache, and salted peanuts on it.  The frozen custard was absolutely delicious.  It smelled and tasted strongly of peanut butter but was so smooth and frozen at the same time.  I don't think I've ever had a dessert like this before.  A very well done dessert!  Thus, you can see why I enjoyed this meal so much.  The dishes were all very delicious and so well done.  I loved the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant too.  No wonder The Gabardine is so highly rated!"}
{"text":"A friend and I have passed this place many many times (it is right at Bay and Richmond) but have never been -- so we thought we'd give it a try. Restaurant was 1/4 filled at 8 pm on a Tuesday night. I can't say no to a bacon cheeseburger. But I wouldn't order this one again. Very bacon-y but burger was dry. Was offered fries or salad... I went for the later but it was just lettuce.  Service was also fine, but not great. We felt a tad rushed when our server came by and asked if we were ready for the bill at 9:30 and we were still drinking our wine. All in all, it was fine. But I'd much rather devour Marben's burger. (And they stay open later.)"}
{"text":"Late 2012 9:30 PM  I had the pork chops... good but not great. Round the corner from the Sheraton hotel.   More of a trendy place."}
{"text":"Imagine it's Thursday and you're trying to find a Friday evening reservation near the Sheraton Centre for seven hip young professionals who love fancy food but also like big servings and a whole lotta booze? WHAT DO YOU DO?  Well, for starters, you call The Gabardine.  This was the situation I was in this week, a bunch of people to impress and not a lot of time to do it! But luckily The Gabardine was up to the challenge. From our initial seating to our final goodbye, we were well-watered, attended, and the food just kept coming. The staff were super helpful, fun, accommodating and really made this dinner a night to remember.  With regards to the atmosphere and seating, the restaurant has cozy corners for couples and some communal tables that makes it appropriate for either lunch or dinner, depending on your fancy. We were located at the table closest to the kitchen and had the bonus of being able to keep tabs on what the food prep looked like before it hit the table.   To begin, we tried a few of the shareable of the appetizers and the scorecard is... -Ploughman's Lunch ~ 19 - A giant platter of patés and terrines with paired munchies like apples, sharp cheddar and preserves. It's HUGE, I've never seen one so generous and tasty for this price. Must-get. (Might even be too much for only two people!) - Deep fried beer cheese croquettes ~ 12 - These look like battered cheese sticks and are amazing. It's like cheesy candy when dipped in the mustard and was also a generous serving. - Smoked Trout - $15 - Tasty, ample, not really my thing so I can't comment too much but everybody else at the table seemed to enjoy it!  Then on to the mains!  I personally had the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich ($16) which was delicious with a heap of little battered shrimp on a thick baguette doused with a generous dousing of tomato relish and a giant side of fries. I tried to switch to salad before my meal came but it was already plated, so they let us keep the fries no problem! Super kudos for that, and my table-mates helped me finish the fries ;)  The Mac and Cheese ($16 or $19 with ham) was huge and probably the most filling of the meals. We ended up finishing the final third as it was too big for one person. One of the tastiest I've ever had. Good cold-weather meal.  Chicken Pot Pie ($19) - A super creamy version of the classic winter warmer, definitely not dry on the inside but a big generous bowl full of goodness.   The pork chop was eaten so fast that I never even had a chance to look down the table at it, but it also went over well. The ONLY main that was small was the fish tacos, which, understandably, is a thing with fish tacos, but it was weird to look at the BEEEG plates we had, and our friend's smaller one. She said they were fantastic, however.  I'll definitely have to come back to test out the cocktail menu however, I had to resort to my third and fourth choice for beverages since they were out of some mixers. Ultimately it was nice to try something I wouldn't normally order, so I went for the gorgeous and floral Hibiscus Royale ($12), and finished the night with a well-topped Caesar. The Kentucky Pete was also a huge hit with our table too.  Needless to say, we were too full for dessert, which just means we need another visit and sometime soon :)"}
{"text":"I met the lovely Steph C for lunch last week. I walked in & instantly felt like I was in a cafe in Europe. Just felt that way for me.   The place packed up pretty quickly yet I was impressed at how quickly we were served. Our waiter gave us time to talk & didn't overly check in on us.   I ordered the club house panino & I loved it. I ate as slow as possible just to savour the taste. The multigrain was perfect; just the right amount of grain and not too dry. The side salad lists that it comes with a \"simple vinaigrette\" and it was just that, simple. It didn't have enough dressing for my liking and I would've liked a bit more flavour. Also the lettuce pieces were big; listening to someones convo and trying to shove lettuce into your mouth is awkward. And cutting your lettuce or taking several bites of one piece looks weird.   All in all, the food & experience was good & we both got back to work in sufficient time. The food is a little on the pricey side, closer to sit-down restaurant prices than a lunch-grab spot. Still, I would def try this lunch spot again."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-3 Food-5 Strikeouts-1/3  Strikeout time!! They have two gender neutral bathrooms, one was out of commission, leading to lineups, and not being that clean! hopefully no one else has to go through this. No penalty in terms of stars since it's out of their control.  The place is small, making seating not as comfortable as it looks, and the wait staff seemed a bit high strung that night. No one was rude, but was over attentive when one of my friends clearly wasn't finished with his food, and she kept asking if he was done every 5-10mins.   The food was simply delicious. Every part of each dish we ordered was done well! Ordered chicken liver Pate, the cabbage nori dish, sirloin bacon cheeseburger, and the chicken pot pie. Best chicken liver I've had! They gave such a huge chunk, that the crostini given(a fare amount) had chunks to spread on each. The pickles were not too salty but full of flavour too. The cabbage didn't taste like cabbage,but sorta like.. a party in my mouth with a bit of kick. The cheeseburger was definitely on the ball, but the highlight was the fries!  No need for ketchup. Every bite was to enjoyed! lastly, I hate chicken pot pie, because my impression of chicken pot pie is like no frills frozen box and you oven it, but this changed my impressions of it. The crust and soup go so well together, and the chicken! Those big pieces at the bottom and done right!  Overall, food was fantastic, the mandatory service charge for having 6 people and the the mediocre service is what got me not giving this place a 5. Definitely a good place for a date!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of restaurants in the financial district, but I'll make an exception for the Gab. It's a cozy and intimate restaurant with attentive staff. Prices are reasonable (for downtown core) and portions are great. I've had their chicken pot pie but the mac and cheese is my go-to dish that wins me over every time."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch, the lunch specials were written on the chalkboard. Immediately, the fish cake stood out. I placed the order on the fish cake. Presentation wise, the plate did not stand out. I find the batter a bit thick and too much potatoe inside."}
{"text":"came here before asthe raptors game last week. convienent location and got a table right away. Things seemed to be going well. The salad was great. ( I love salad) and then got the cheeseburger ( I love cheesburgerzz) it was really good. nicely melted cheese and gthe bun was warm. My husband had the mac n cheese with ham, tasted great, but only had a few cubes of ham. didnt seem worth the price. We will come back next time we are in the hood and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I really really liked this place. Upon walking in, I already liked it. Tucked just south of Queen street in the heart of downtown, this small restaurant serves simple, flavourful food, with dishes you don't see everywhere.   The rustic decor gives it so much character. Make sure to make a reservation because it's busy!!  Unfortunately, I had a huge lunch and couldn't try the entrees like I wanted. Instead I got a salad, but this roasted pear and cheese salad was really good. I stole some fries from my DPs burger dish and it was SO GOOD.   For dessert had the caramel apple in a jar (it was something more fancy in the description). It was tasty.   I really like the variety and unique dishes at a good price point, this is going to be my new go to place.  Parking is $6 at Nathan Phillips Square after 6pm"}
{"text":"It was a Thursday celebratory evening dinner. All was well in Toronto, clear crisp day, passed exam, new hair cut and no reservations at Garbardine. The service was lovely. They were full but still managed to fit our little party in.  Great draft beers to try: the Chambly and my personal fav, Okanagan (BC represent!)  As for the food, here is where the lucky stars started to fall.  - Beer cheese (app): It's a glorified mozzarella stick coated in bread crumbs and then deep fried... There wasn't enough cheese, oddly potatoe-y. - Shrimp po boy: Crispy and plentiful but I found the sauce to be overpowering and too sweet. - Chicken and waffle: The chicken was over crispy and lacked sophistication in its flavouring... The waffle was good but they slabbed on collards or something that made it mushy. And I HATE mushy. - Burger: one word, WINNER. This burger was perfect. Perfectly cooked. Perfectly flavoured, a personal fav in burgerville. - Cheesecake: Also a winner. First, it's made from goat milk, so there is quite a strong flavour there and second, it's deconstructed. OMG the rhubarb compote! Where have you been my entire existing?  All the mains were a very healthy size.  Well Gabardine, you truly deserve a 3.5 but since I can't give you a .5, I'll just put in 'High five!' Still had a great dinner though!  But the best part of the evening, my cousin picked up the tab...  Shout out to my peeps."}
{"text":"Really great comfort food in a cozy setting.  The southern fried chicken sandwich was delish!  The bacon cheese burger was yummy but a tiny bit oily.  Fries were a bit salty but I still devoured them.  I didn't try the chicken pot pie but it looked amazing.  Next time I need to try the mac and cheese. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"It was a late night and my family and I had just driven up to our hotel and as soon as we got connected we tried to find some good grub. The Gabardine was the closet, highest rated, and most reasonably priced restaurant we could find near our hotel.   We sat at the bar and my father had a smoked trout salad to start. The presentation was gorgeous with a beautiful peace of trout covered in a salad of cabbage and a citrus dressing. And that was just the beginning.   2/4 of us had the burger. Each entree ranged from 11-30 dollars. My mother and I split the home-ground sirloin burger and the club house panino. My father had the beet risotto. All were fantastic, especially the burger. You could tell the meat was indeed ground at the restaurant. It was moist, tender and full of flavor. Very possibly the best burger I've ever had. Most of their sandwiches came with aioli which really made it. My panino was delicious, the bread was hot and the chicken was very tender. The side of the panino was some greens lightly dressed to perfection! My father's risotto, amazing yet again. The risotto was perfectly cooked with a some crumbled goat cheese on top with some greens for garnish. You got a good taste of the beets, as well as the cheese. The color was quite interesting as well! Oh and to go along with the delicious fries, they had a home made ketchup. It was quite different with brown sugar and a hint of honey, however it was delicious. Didn't get the try the dessert, however the cappuccino I had was delectable!  On top of all of the delicious food and drinks, the ambiance and the service was great. The room had dim lighting, pleasing to the eyes, with an eclectic style. The service was very friendly and conversational. This is a place I will remember to come back to next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Had the squid ink risotto special.  So delicious! Would definitely come back for some more hearty goodness"}
{"text":"Love the Port Chop there. 3rd time visit already."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful evening. Every dish had complex subtle flavors, the service was professional and unobtrusive, the wine was smooth."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week. Service and food is consistent if not better than the typical fare around my office. Gets busy during the lunch hour, best to call ahead! They'll get you in and out quickly if need be."}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for place to grab a quick lunch or dinner in Toronto.  We tried this restaurant on my first day in the city.  My gf ordered their grilled cheese, which she raves about to this day.  Based on the few bites I had, it was actually pretty delicious.  It honestly wasn't your average grilled cheese.  There was this mix of cheesy, savory and sweet that we didn't expect, that went really well together.  On the other hand, I ordered their burger.  Not only was it cooked exactly as I wanted it, but it also very juicy and well seasoned, and came with lightly seasoned fries.  She washed her meal down with cider, while I opted for the spiked lemonade - a must try!    As a side note, this was also the very first place where I learned that restaurants in Toronto bring credit machines to your table if you're paying by card.  The entire process is so simple and quick.  I love it.  If only NY would follow suit!"}
{"text":"WHat's not to love in a cute little cozy restaurant with lots of wholesome food and VERY VERY filling for a decent price?  WHen I say 'DECENT\" i don't mean ... cheap... I mean for the proportion and the amount of 'fullness' I feel, I don't feel ripped off at all!  Everything we ordered, we had to share because we all wanted to try each other's dishes. We did have the chicken pot pie (huge, hot, and filling). After a few more spoonfuls, you kind of get bored of it --- like that feeling that you are too full to eat it... and want other flavours to explode in your mouth (that's how I felt).  Luckily, my dish arrived and it was the shrimp po boy! mmmm It was definitely flavourful indeed.  I shared it with 3 other people and I still FELT FULL!!! I thought i pretty much gave more than half my sandwich away.. but once again, After awhile of eating it.... the flavours get boring and gotta move on to other foods.  My friend ordered the tacO *which i felt was the most jipped dish since after splitting it with everyone, she barely had enough for herself to eat. *NOTE: not a sharing sharing dish --- order something else if you want to share with many  My friend ordered a meat dish... THIS was the beef or pork plate?? IT WAS one of the meat dishes and it was HUGEEEEEEEEE .. he finished it.. but if it was me --- i cound't handle that large proportion.. so DON\"T WORRY boys , you'll be nice a full 'after you're done eating here!  I'd go back for some filling dinner and knowing that the food is good, atmosphere is nice, and size of the restaurant is decent -- why wouldn't i?"}
{"text":"Great lunch place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were running an errand at lunch today, when we happened to come across The Gabardine. Being one of the many places on our list of restaurants to try, we decided to pop in. It was packed, but we got a table after only a few minutes wait.   We started off with drinks - he had a beer (I did not pay attention to what kind), and I had a French Martini (which is a drink made of vodka, chambord, pineapple juice, and lemon twist). My drink was delicious and refreshing... I thought it looked a little small, but it packs a bigger punch than it looks.   We ordered the famous Mac and Cheese and the Sirloin Bacon Cheeseburger to share. They were both as good as I expected ! The burger was definitely one of the best I have had - very flavourful and juicy without being greasy. The fries that came with it were well seasoned. The Mac and Cheese was one of the cheesiest I have ever had at a restaurant. There is an option to add ham to it, but I think it is decadent enough without.   The wait for the food was quite a bit longer than the wait for our table, considering how we arrived at 1:30pm or so - but it WAS lunchtime in the Financial District, so I consider this a very minor drawback. Service was good - friendly and efficient. I love the what they did with the space.. everything from the banquettes to the lights. Everything goes together well and totally works.   I'd like to come back again to try some other things on the menu... like the Po Boy Sandwich, the Club House sandwich, the Chicken Pot Pie... oh hell, I might have to come back and try everything!"}
{"text":"Quite delicious! Went there for the first time for lunch and tried the Deviled Eggs and Burger. Both were quite delightful. The fries were fantastic. a little pricey, but for a tasty burger and laid back atmosphere, 4 stars is well deserved."}
{"text":"The food is terrific, the prices are reasonable, the location is great, and the atmosphere is surprisingly pleasant despite its Bay Street address. The only complaint would be the small selection/variety of dishes, and the tiny interior that only accommodates a handful of diners."}
{"text":"We went to Gabardine for dinner. I ordered the Marconi and cheese. I would recommend adding the ham just for variety. I thought that the ham went well with the Mac and cheese. While it may seem like it is a small quantity, the cheesiness can fill you up.   My friend got the the chicken pot pie. It was also done really well and I especially loved the crust.    I also got the Brewmaster Black lager. While it is a dark beer, it isn't particularly bitter (which I appreciated).   Overall, I would visit again. Seating is close together and you would have to book ahead of time for dinner. It tends to get really packed for lunch and they don't take reservations for lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down the best after-work spot (for cool people) in the Bay St area. The cocktails are well-made, the food menu is intriguing, and the decor is very unique for this part of town (white tiled back splash, curved bar, wooden tables, low lighting). Could be good for a date. The Ploughman's Platter is scrumptious: includes various tapenades of pork, rabbit, and chicken pate accompanied by deviled eggs and toasted baguette chips. Minus one for the staff who was not very friendly or professional (washing glasses in front of me when I was trying to get their attention). They really took away from everything else that was so cool here. Nevertheless, The Gabardine is truly the only enticing spot in the neighborhood and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I heard the chicken pot pie was delicious and a \"must order\". Sounded a bit too heavy, but as I'm not often in Toronto, I ordered it for lunch and decided to suffer any consequences that came from eating such a heavy dish mid-day. It was delicious!! Reminded me if my grandmother's with the flakey scrumptious crust and hick chicken and gravy filling. Well done. Odd about the iced tea I ordered though....nested in a can?? Will be back."}
{"text":"Food is listed as Canadian cuisine but they really serve more comfort food. I ordered the Haddock Po' boy with fries, the fries were really good and the Po' boy may be the best Po' boy i have ever had. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken pot pie which was also delicious. We also saw the couple next to us devouring what looked to really delicious mac n cheese. Lastly, we got the cinnamon sugar butternut squash donuts with whipped goat cheese, it was pretty good but we when we went to order they were out of 3 of there 5 desserts. We really wanted the blondie that sounded delicious. Despite this the food was phenomenal if I'm ever back in Toronto this will be the first place i go to eat."}
{"text":"Not busy on a weekday night around 5:30pm. The food was done very well, whether it's burger, fish, or even their fries! Will definitely come back!!   Nice decor with lights, tres romantique!"}
{"text":"Really interesting restaurant, mainly opened for Business People around the area (they don't open in weekends). Here is one of those places that makes me want to go work at Downtown.  American and Fusion style food, taste is delicious, well known for their burgers which taste good, a bit oily on my preference, but overall really nice quality, quantity and presentation. It worth to try.  What blew my mind wasn't the burger tho... It was the special of the day - Leek Soup, that is one of the best soups I have ever tried.  The place is worth to visit, get together with friends, have some drinks or coffee. The staff is really friendly and customer caring.  BTW, at the beginning is hard to find the place since there are constructions around, so take your time and the delicious food will pay back :D  Good luck with your visit!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly - whoever the server was at the bar last week, he entertained guests who were waiting for a table, and also helped take orders from my party promptly.  I had the fish tacos! It was good, but the double layering of the shells was a little heavy for my taste because I could taste the corn starch pretty heavily.  This is according to my own preference, because my coworker who got the same dish absolutely loved it.  It was really busy during lunch during a weekday and there were constantly people looking for a seat after noon. I'd plan to arrive a little earlier without a reservation."}
{"text":"Been here several times, tried a few things on the menu.  Love the environment (this most recent time there were quite a few flies on the wall... minus a star for that...), dim, romantic, nicely decorated, attentive staff.  hubby absolutely loves the burger, it also comes with heaping plate of seasoned fries. I've tried the mac and cheese with ham, the chicken pot pie, the fish tacos, as well as the fish sandwich. Maybe the fish sandwich was a meh - bun was a bit weird. But over all, The quality of food here is always awesome.  and certainly, it helps to have a nice cold beer with your burger. try it, and steer clear of the flies"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese burger and the macaroni and cheese with ham. Food tastes good overall and it's at a convenient location! It's blocked by the construction so make sure you know where the restaurant is. Only reason why it's 4 star instead of 5 is because there is nothing special with the food. Just standard stuff available on the menu (sandwich. Burgers. Pasta)"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way through Toronto. My husband really liked his sandwich and cocktail. My fish tacos and cocktail were okay, but nothing special. Our deviled eggs appetizer was disappointing - too rich with little flavor. The service was fantastic and the vibe of the space was really cool."}
{"text":"Good spot! Vibe is good, trendy and slightly older crowd (makes sense for its location). Had the southern fried chicken sandwich with salad. Amazing. Salad was just greens and dressing but very flavourful. Sandwich was juicy and didn't need any additional sauces. Great meal. Ordered the devereaux (bourbon and other stuff). It was good and strong but I would probably try something different next time. Had rhe butternut squash doughnut for dessert - good and unique dish to share with friends. Service was a little slow which is the only reason I gave this place a four instead of a five."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to The Gabardine for some time to try out their famous mac and cheese. Word of advice: go when you are super hungry, since it got increasingly difficult for me to devour the whole thing on my own. The breadcrumbs and the cheesiness was what made the mac and cheese stand out from all of the other mac and cheeses. Personally, because it is a pretty simple dish, I think $22 is a little pricey...I would probably pay like $15 max. Service was friendly and the interior was super cute. I would recommend this place for a lunch/dinner date."}
{"text":"Make a reservation since it's a pretty busy restaurant and not very large. I had emailed to ask a question about the menu and place my reservation - they responded within hours.  The Mac And Cheese was deliciously creamy and filling. My husband had the Fried Haddock Po Boy which was tasty as well and came with a generous portion of fries. My dish was better though ;)  We were seated right next to the open kitchen which I thought was awesome at first. I quickly realized that there were some fall decorations (squash etc) on the booth separating my table and the kitchen, and they were attracting fruit flies. None came on my food and they weren't inside the actual kitchen area, but obviously this was off-putting."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese was really good. I liked their salad as well. The fish tacos were merely meh. I say go for the atmosphere. It's a lovely spot at night. Elegant yet comfy, a hard to find combo."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - we went here before heading to the Blue Jays game, it is super close to my work so very convenient (hard to spot though due to scaffolding). I made a reservation which was a good call as they were very busy when I got there. The restaurant is small but cozy, trendy feel. The staff was very efficient and I guess you would have to be with that many people to serve!  I wasn't blown away by the food and I can speak for myself only right now. I got the Trinidadian Chana sandwich, I originally wanted the risotto but unfortunately for me that days special was with goat cheese, the worst cheese of all the cheeses! The sandwich was good, the coleslaw was yummy and the bun, though it looks unappealing, was actually great - toasty and buttery. The Chana was ok, I have def had better, all together it works. Fries were nice, really enjoyed the seasoning. I just felt like it was all good but not great. I got the hibiscus Royale to drink, it was really good and very potent, but also cost the same as my meal! My boyfriend got the chicken pot pie. It was huge! The crust was fresh and perfectly done. The inside was very creamy and hot, I got the impression he felt it didn't have enough chicken in it. He did seem to enjoy it overall, I think with his meal the rating would have been higher. I still really want to check out their Mac n Cheese, with seasoned bread crumbs on top. So I will likely be back and maybe that will up the rating!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of the place. Highly recommend the Mac and cheese and the chicken pot pie. Beware of your first few bites because they are piping hot. Love the quick service for lunch. I definitely am going to come back for dinner"}
{"text":"Cute cozy place with the most amazing mac n cheese and chicken pot pie! But the scene stealer here is the fried cauliflower coated with sweet gochujang sauce. Every table orders it and you'll regret it if you don't (even if you dislike cauliflower this is a must)  The mac n cheese has the richness flavour I've ever tasted, which also makes this the heaviest thing ever haha so come super hungry! The chicken pot pie is super divine and I loved how you can taste each ingredient's natural flavours instead of it all being mushed and cloaked over with heavy sauce. The pie crust is very flakey and buttery, mmm, perfect.   I don't think this is an every day place but if you're really craving that home-y yet upscale diner food? This is the place :)   The mussels and sandwiches are also good, just not my favourites.  P.s. It's quite small so I don't recommend a large group and reserve in advance as it was very busy!"}
{"text":"Literally everything is amazing. You cannot go wrong. The fried chicken sandwich, the mac and cheese, the tuna melt, the fish of the day. So good. Great beer selection and friendly staff. This place is always busy so come early."}
{"text":"Found this gem when i was searching for a nearby western restaurant close to work with good food on yelp and I am glad I had the opportunity to come here.  This place is a small little restaurant with a bar table near the door, it has tables that can fit around 30 people at a time.  Decoration is very modern and relaxing, chairs are also very comfortable!  The selections on the menu is a little limited, but I didn't mind that.  Specializes on what you are good at is key.  On two separate occasions, I tried the Chicken Pot Pie and the Mac and Cheese with Smoked Ham.  Both dishes were well-made!  Mac and Cheese was baked to perfection although it did feel a little heavy, the Chicken Pot Pie was full of ingredients and the puff layer to cover the pie was amazingly done!  For appetizer I tried the deep fried beer cheese \"rarebit\" and it was also very good.  You can really taste the beer and the honey mustard pairing complemented well with the beer cheese.  5 out of 5 in my book!  Very cozy and relaxing environment with great food!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the cheeseburger but the Mac and cheese was amazing. Noise level was okay. Overall atmosphere was pretty good."}
{"text":"The shredded pork sandwich is mind-blowing- easily the best of its kind I've eaten in years. The mac n' cheese was also very tasty.  This resto is a cozy, welcoming place. Make reservations, though, as it's a small place that seems to be very popular."}
{"text":"Venue: The Gabardine Specialty: Canadian comfort food Dining experience: Dinner Menu items: Deep fried beer cheese croquettes, Rabit Rillettes, Mac & Cheese, Shrimp Po'boy and Goat \"icebox\" cheesecake.  Two weeks ago I ventured into The Gabardine for the first time and was quickly impressed by the venue's decor and vibe. The Gabardine is not your traditional Bay Street restaurant catering to the suits and ties in the financial district. It's a more relaxed joint with a passion for all things tasty and yummy, an open concept kitchen and waiters that know their drinks and food really well.  Accompanied by a trio of female foodies, we decided to make this night an unforgettable one and indulge in almost every dish The Gabardine offered, which turned into a four hour ordeal.  Our night kicked-off with the Deep Fried Beer Cheese Croquettes.These bundles of joy tasted like heaven and were oozing with cheese. The batter was delicate and thin and had that extra beer-tasting note one often needs on Thursday night, just when the work week is about to end. We dipped these ooey-gooey creatures in a maple mustard sauce, which brought another dimension to the dish. The result? Double-dipping!  Next up, we ordered the Rabbit Rillettes. This was basically a rabbit pâté sitting on a bed of sour cherry preserve and accompanied by small pieces of toasted baguette.  Though pâté tends to be silky-smooth, we did not mind at all the chunky pieces served on the rillette as it gave more texture to the dish. Rillettes are very similar to pâtés but made a little coarser and are traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder.  Once our palettes were enchanted by all the fried, buttery and fatty goodness from our appies. We decided not to deviate from our goal - have an awesome time with zero worries on fat and calorie intake. As such, we decided to continue on the same tune and ventured into The Gabardine's infamous Mac & Cheese.  For me, this was the star dish of the night; I've yet to try a Mac & Cheese like this one. The pasta is perfectly cooked and baked with tons of cheese and what I assume a cream sauce made with endless amounts of butter and milk. Topped with breadcrumbs and herbs, this dish had flavour and texture like no other.  Back on the deep-fried tune, we decided to split in 4 sections (regretting afterwards) the Shrimp Po'boy. A perfectly assembled sandwich with pieces of deep-fried shrimp wrapped in butter lettuce, tomato relish and aioli. What we liked most about this dish was how well balanced it was with the greens and the sauce. Not too dry or mushy, just the most succulent bites of deep-fried shrimp. And since we were kicking ourselves for not ordering more, we settled for devouring the tasty french fries that accompanied the dish. The fries, were almost as good as my fave fries from Marben.  And since we were in a butter and batter comatose, we ended the night by cleansing off our palates with a smooth and refreshing Goat \"icebox\" cheesecake with roasted almond granola and berry jam coulis. The creaminess and mild sweetness from the goat's milk ice-cream was probably my favourite part of this dessert. A perfect de-constructed dessert that just hit the spot.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Came here once with friends probably a year ago. Long overdue review I know. Lol. I remember it being quite packed and since I didn't have reservations, I was waiting about 20 or so minutes to get a table.   Through Yelp reviews, I decided on their popular Mac and Cheese with smoked ham. It was good but I don't think memorable. Especially, since it costs $19!! I think that's way too overpriced for Mac and Cheese. Maybe since its in the financial district and they are aiming towards the business set? Personally, for almost $20 it should be the best darn Mac and Cheese I have ever tasted and come with a side dish like fries or even a soda drink! Besides the price, the one big issue that actually blocked out everything else and is the main reason why I'm taking off stars is what happened during my dinner.   My dinner was going fine, until all of a sudden I noticed a film of light grey smoke covering the restaurant. I don't know what was happening in the kitchen when I was there, but the smoke coming out of the kitchen was to the point it caused me to cough a lot. I half wondered if someone accidentally burnt food or a pan? It was weird and my group was sitting waayy in the front of the resto too. About 2 tables away from the window/doors. I don't know how diners who were sitting right near the kitchen handled it. If it were just me, I would have just left.   My group was finishing up our meals and smoke had noticeably dyed down by this point. While servers were polite, they did not address the issue or say anything about it, so I just left confused about the situation.   Hopefully, my experience was an anomaly but I didn't come back after because of that. If you decide to give it a go anyways, the decor is nice and they have low lighting. It looks to be suitable for groups, dates and if you are grabbing food with coworkers."}
{"text":"The Gabardine is a ten out of ten - it checks every box: Great, bustling atmosphere Fantastic food (fried beer cheese OMG) Friendly & attentive service Did I mention the food!? I would order anything off the menu, all looks super appetizing & huge servings also. Some places don't live up to the hype, but some do! Enjoy! Ps. reservations are a must (at least for dinner)"}
{"text":"Dinner gets really loud and busy.  Make a reservation if you can.  Not recommend for first date"}
{"text":"lunch on a Thursday afternoon with a good friend in the financial district, Gabardine was a winner!  First off this place does not take reservations for breakfast nor lunch, only dinner, so be sure to show up early, because it gets loudly packed during weekdays.   Mac and cheese with Ham!!!! 5/5 just complete blissful perfection, soft, smooth, silky, and RICH indeed.  This is a heavy hitter, and the portion is perfectly filling. its topped off with bread crumbs so it adds a beautiful crunch to the overall dish! definitley among my favorites.  SoftCorn Tortillas beautiful presentation i must say.  Diverse flavors to go along with the ontario white fish include the avocado cream, with purple coldslaw and salsa verde.  A lot less heavier than the Mac and cheese!  4.5/5  Goat Icebox cheesecake was a perfect way to end off this meal, a perfect 5/5 served on a bed of well handpicked blue berries and rasberries.  The honey crumble that came along with this added more lovely sweet flavors to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Was on my way to have lunch elsewhere when I walk past a window underneath scaffolding with plenty of people inside. Place looks unusual compared to others around, had an old school Parisian look to it.  We poke our heads in to see if there were seats (there weren't) and but still looked at the menu because we're hungry. What was supposed to he 20 min wait was a 5 min wait. The menu kinda looks underwhelming but with hungry stomachs we decide to stay.  Once seated, the waiter was great. He was friendly and poured water immediately. Suggested trying the shrimp po'boy and it did not disappoint. This po-boy brought back memories of my time back in Alabama. There were shrimp bursting out of that French bread with the tomato relish piled on top! How could I eat into this monstrosity. I open my mouth and take a bite of a balance that was surreal. The tomato relish surely made the sandwich!   We also had the chicken BLT with fries. Compared to the po'boy, it does not stand a chance. But on its own it was too much for one person as the chicken, bacon, lettuce and tomato piled high. The fries were also an immense stack that were justifiably enough to taste fabulous.  The crowd has a lot of suits here. They kicking it back with a beer for lunch. The prices are reasonable. My only beef is the menu items don't jump out and grab my intention. I think they could make the menu sounds a bit better, but perhaps not because there aren't any available seats."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious. If you work in the financial district, this is a nice place to go for those lunch meetings on the company's dime. It isn't stodgy, a chain restaurant, or a place that might as well be a chain restaurant like so many other financial district spots. The haddock po' boy was interesting and delish."}
{"text":"It's a grand change from most other dining options in the northern downtown core (which there are not that many that don't go by a ubiquitous corporate chain name or open only for the M-F-9-5 Bay Street crowd), but The Gabardine makes me feel like a Don Draper-type character trapped in a 1920s Manhattan tavern or hotel bar, surrounded by modern hipsters. That seems the best way to describe a place that feels dimmed and \"vintage classy-manly,\" with its seats filled with a mix of Bay Street suits and hip young faces. I guess I quasi-fit right in... in through the narrow entry and were in the early weekday evening seated soon after another pair had just left. It's bigger than it looks from the outside.  The $18 sirloin burger, served with tasty well-seasoned fries, seemed kind of basic in the toppings department beyond the couple sticks of bacon. The ground patty was a grand big inch thick (based on my trusty thumb ruler) and juicy, but bite after bite reminded me much of a $6 sirloin burger I had in Buffalo. Well, maybe that is not a fair comparison, but it wasn't an impressive burger either for that price. Eh, you can sell me on how the meat is humanely raised or some other Portlandia-type gourmet rationale, and maybe I'll shell out a fair $12-ish for the whole meal. But $18? I'd bloody rather run to their kitchen, find a bone saw, detach one of my arm and offer that as payment. Which is pretty much my eyegouged response to most of the menu, though it should be said all their entrees are definitely largely portioned for their price points. To really feel like you got your money's worth, come with an empty stomach.  There was also the chicken pot pie on the table that I ended up finishing. In retrospective, this is a much better choice. It's a giant beast, and its thick crispy crust hides an endless slurry of heartwarming creaminess that never seems to cool down. Perfect for telling an extreme winter cold to bugger off to hell.  Their mac 'n cheese, served with smoked ham slices on top, looked so tempting like something I should try in the event I ever find myself here again, hopefully with all four limbs intact. I also enjoyed also their various house cocktails, but not so much the hint of snottiness emanating from some of the staff.  {TTC: 6 bus to the Richmond/Adelaide block, or any Queen streetcar to Bay Street and walk south a block.}"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto and perhaps anywhere.  Home cooking hipster foodie friendly place tucked away in downtown."}
{"text":"Look this place is as good as it gets. First off it use to be a hole in wall, the place before it was awful. I guess the previous restaurant tanked (go figure) so this place opened right up. Its beautiful inside. All white a little glamorous and super cozy. In the middle of all the hussel bussel fast food garbage, this place is a gem.   Lets talk food: The food is incredible. I will start off by saying, my boyfriends work is right around the corner and when it opened, that week alone there were people from his work who went 3 times a day-no joke. He ranted and raved about this place and I finally got to go last night......its well worth raving about. The menu isn't even pricey considering the that you pay for and what you get. Even if you think its a bit pricey its still so damn worth it! I will not eat pulled pork. The though of it totally turns me off and the few other times i have had it i hated it. This place changed my mind completely. I got the pulled pork sandwich-O M G it was delicious. SO juicy and full of flavor, a little messy but you don't care when your eating it you just want it all in your belly. I got a side garden salad with balsamic dressing. This is my forte, I eat garden salad pretty much every time i go out and balsamic dressing i love, but i have never had dressing like this. It was so amazing words cant describe. My boyfriend got a burger-that ish tops any burger joint ive gone to,ever. It was perfectly made, not to greasy and just the most impressive homemade burger. Fresh homemade hand cute fries were the winner at our table, everyone dived in and did not stop. You didn't even need to add ketchup or salt, they were perfect!  dessert was ridiculous. Everyone else got dessert and i got to try a bit of each:) I would recommend the Burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich and Sticky toffee pudding with sweet cream and toffee sauce...To.Die.For. This place is so impressive.   Lets talk service: Really really good. Even though the place looks kind of, say, uppity, the servers are not. Our guy was super friendly and was talking to us like we were regulars. which i though was really key, especially because the place was so busy, but he made us feel like we were worth his time. Key in any dining experience. You want to know your being taken care of right? one of our guests had ordered a salad with her meal but wanted to change it to fries. We call over the server, we get the fries for free.........UGH when does that ever happen? Id say never, so im even more impressed now.    Overall: really good experience, atmosphere and AMAZING food. I know this one is a winner just from the buzz i have heard about it and the many repeat customers it has created :my boyfriend and his fleet or workers lol Definitely going back again and again and again....and maybe again :)"}
{"text":"The gabardine serves simple food with a gourmet flair... making it ... not so simple?  In a cute little restaurant with dim lighting and an open kitchen, the place seemed perfect for a date... and for me a catch up with a friend visiting from far far away. Service was definitely not the quickest, and we were pretty much waiting for our server to come to our table, do his job, and rush off to the next task.  After much debate, I went with the smoke trout salad with beans, shredded olives, and roumalade... in my mind, a twist on a nicoise inspired salad :). Not going to lie... the portion was smaller than I expected and left me wanting more. The smoked trout was very aromatic and it seemed to be infused with every bite.... still wish it was a little bigger.  My friend who got the smoked meat salad said it was good, especially the potato salad.  For dessert, we decided to share the strawberry and rhubarb shortcake with marscapone cream. I was surprised that there was only one shortcake (thought I had seen 2 in other photos). The rhubarb pieces were cut at a good size so I could actually taste it. The marscapone did taste more like whip cream.. but I guess I will never know.  We ordered soda water and it seemed to be unlimited and charged at $1 / person. I think this place is really cute, but may be a better fit for lunch appetites. There are dishes like mac and cheese and chicken pot pie for dinner plates that may satisfy the dinner palette.... heard it is REALLY GOOD."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I started with the gin and tonic, where they infuse their own tonic and sprinkle it with juniper berries. It was delightful. One of my favourite G&T recipes now.   I ordered the chicken pot pie, a signature dish. It came out piping hot, but not so hot you couldn't eat it. The herbed pie crust was perfectly crisp on top and moist underneath. Wonderful chunks of carrot and chicken in the white sauce gravy. I did find the sauce a bit heavy for my preference. But yummy and filling.   The staff is attentive but not constantly at you.   The space is quaint so the noise level escalates but it isn't overly invasive.   Definitely on the return list."}
{"text":"This is a lovely, charming, with a hint of a quaint quality underlying it, restaurant. I came here for drinks after work b/c I read it was part of the happy hour list from Toronto Life. While the cocktails are not meticulously made as they are in Museum Tavern, they have a respectable list. This time around, I did not feel like having a cocktail and instead ordered a Quebecois beer, which had a citrus flavour. I ordered the pear, walnut and goat cheese salad. Service was good."}
{"text":"My go-to place if I find myself looking for restaurants in the financial district! Everything on the menu here is de-licious! Atmosphere is great, with a good mix of suits as well as more casual downtown folk. Great decor, bar and cocktail list is impressive, and food is hearty and flavourful. I had the chicken pot pie when I went and another friend had the mac and cheese - both super hearty (albeit a bit heavy after a while). Amazing desserts as well!   Small space so make a reservation if you can but otherwise, you can usually get a spot fairly quickly if you beat the rush."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with some friends as party of 6. I feel like it's so hard nowadays to find a really good breakfast/lunch/brunch place in Toronto. I'm so glad that I came across this place. Most of the meals we had eaten over the week were subpar or absolutely terrible, so it was nice to FINALLY have a good meal.  The restaurant is under construction around the exterior, so it can be a little difficult to find. If you need a landmark to get an idea of where the restaurant is, it is nearish to the Eaton Centre and Old City Hall.   The restaurant was very busy. The environment was casual, but the tables were very close to together. Be prepared to get cozy with your neighbours as there isn't a lot of room to move around in this place.  We were seated within minutes, and our orders were taken quite quickly. My friends ordered Mac 'n' Cheese, while others ordered the Fish Tacos and the Sirloin Bacon Cheeseburger. They all enjoyed their meals. Looking back, my friends, who were visiting from all over Canada and the USA, did nothing but reminisce about how good the mac 'n' cheese was, so much so that they started dreaming about it (literally). Oh boy, did that mac 'n' cheese become a recurrent topic of discussion when recounting their vacation.   I ordered the Sirloin Bacon Cheeseburger. It was sooooooooooooo good. The burger patty completely cooked, but still maintained the taste. The burger as a whole was oozing with juicy goodness (4.5/5 in taste).   The portion size was large, and the food was very filling! The positive reviews about this place are true to their nature."}
{"text":"I loved this little restaurant so much that I wish I could've eaten here more than once during my short trip to Toronto earlier this week.   I stopped in on Tuesday for dinner and fortunately had a reservation. The place was packed. Tables are close together and I could hear the conversations going on to my right and left, but I tried not to focus on that too much. The drinks and food in front of me were too great to care.  My first drink was the juniper gin and tonic, which was a great twist on the classic, and my second was the hibiscus royale. Delicious! I also hear the spiked lemonade with gin was good. I can't believe I didn't sneak a sip. Strange of me.  For an app, I had the deep fried beer cheese croquettes and they went down too quickly. It was ridiculous. They were too good.  When it came time for my main dish, I flip-flopped between the chicken pot pie and the mac and cheese. I had read the Yelp reviews ahead of my visit and both sounded top-notch. Finally, I decided on the chicken pot pie and geesh! That thing was huge. Huge. And so, so good, creamy, fresh, meaty, crusty and hot. Man, oh man.  Considering my level of stuffed-to-the-core, I don't know why I ordered dessert. But I did: the mini doughnuts. Cleared the plate, too. Tells you something.  The Gabardine is an experience I'll most definitely want to repeat if I'm ever in Toronto again. Fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"This is a bit of a throwback from about 6 months ago, but came across this place on Yelp again and I wanted to go back. Me and a friend decided to stop by at 5pm on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was relatively empty, but it turned out almost every table had reservations. No biggie, I actually don't mind sitting at the bar if I'm only with one other person.   Like other reviews, the clientèle were mainly suits a couple of classy ladies. It was still quite a casual setting so don't feel inclined to come here with a top hat and monocle.   Me and my friend actually came here for drinks and a bit of food.   Beef Tartare (18) - it was good. Ingredients seemed to be fresh, although I felt like I could of gotten the same dish elsewhere. It wasn't mind blowing but it was good.   So then we got cocktails. They were bomb (or maybe that's the cocktails talking, getting all cocky) .   The Argyle (13) - you can taste the hit. But the sweetness hit you after, pretending like you were never drinking in the first place.   Classic Caesar (11) - biased. I love Caesars because they are life and this was pretty good. Of course I've had better, but oh man I've had much worse.  Hibiscus Royal (12) - my favourite from the list. It's so soft, not too sweet, not too bitter but like you're sitting in the meadows.. With a cocktail.   The Devereaux (14) - it was good! Not bad, but not really my favourite.   The service was also good. I feel like it was an all around good restaurant at a good location. Not really a place where I HAVE to have gone to, but it's good (as I've said before) ."}
{"text":"Was meeting up with an acquaintance from long ago, so wanted to find something simple and that didn't cost the earth.   Found this place when looking through reviews and thought it might work.    When I arrived, my acquaintance was already seated.  He indicated that he had been there for only a couple of mins but had already had a bit of an issue with the server.  The Server kept squeezing the table into him, each time he pushed it away to get some space, she pushed it back.    We had ordered and each time the server came I got rather curt responses.  I had ordered the Fish tacos.  The food was served up in a decent amount of time.  The fish was battered haddock, which was ok, but it was fairly heavily battered, and the amount of fish was pretty small underneath all that batter.  There were some sprigs of 'Slaw' and what was supposed to be a avocado crema & taqueria salsa, but this was in pretty short supply, and it was hard to even tell there was any avo in the taco.  It wasn't anything special.    End of the visit and time to pay the bill... $30 for 3 tacos and a beer.  I gotta say, it really wasn't worth it.    Overall, The service, although being quick and attentive, it felt as though I had stayed too long at a friends and the sooner they could get me out the door the better.   The food was ok, but I just think that for the amount you get and the quality, it just doesn't add up.   Maybe this was the perfect storm, ie: bad night for the server and tacos isn't their signature meal.  However, that being said it's unlikely I'll be going back.  Too bad as it does have a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cosy and inviting! This place serves the best fried chicken sandwich that I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Came here after work one day so there were plenty of seats available. Service was great. We ordered: - Chicken Pot Pie: I love comfort and warm foods so I thought this was excellent! The portion was a little big though - I couldn't finish it all. The crust was crispy and the inside was nice and hot. Very yummy. - Risotto (beets): I didn't like the risotto :( the taste was very bland - I wouldn't order this again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I have been twice and my manager has been several and both of us have never had a bad meal. Make sure you order fries, they are the best.   The lunch crowd fills up quickly so be sure to come early or have a small group with you. It can also get quite noisy as well."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for quite a while now and I'm so happy we got to finally try it on a double date night!  Service was ok from some and amazing from who I'm guessing it's the owner or manager. We ordered the Korean fried cauliflower to start and it was so good! I could and would come back just for a plate of that. :)  We had the fish special which was well balanced but I wasn't a big fan. My boyfriend had the Mac and cheese with ham pieces on top. That was really cheesy and satisfying!!   I had the fish tacos which didn't come with sides but still enjoyable. I think the coslaw could have been more acidic to add a bit of dynamic.   The mains were okay and I enjoyed them. I think they get points for originality :)   Definitely want to come back and try other things here and more deep fried cauliflower!!!!"}
{"text":"Update:  LOVED the grilled cheese!  It was sooooo cheesy, with cheese oozing out from between the dark rye bread (great mix by the way).  I added peameal to my sandwich - never though I would like the combo, but it was delicious and hearty.  They don't cheap out with the peameal either.  There's a nice thick layer of peameal bacon in there.    The sandwich is accompanied by a side salad, to cut the grease.  I love their house dressing with delicious fresh dill.    Service was attentive, even with the busy lunch rush.  I was happy that my water glass was always full!  (Sometimes the restaurants with the tiny water glasses don't come around often enough to fill them, and I drink a lot of water with my meals!)    As mentioned, the lunch hour is usually quite busy, so hopefully you don't have too many bags with you, b/c it's a tight squeeze in there."}
{"text":"Hands down, Fish Pie and Roasted Brined Pork Chop.    I came upon this place based on a recommendation from a friend that lives in Toronto.  I looked up the Yelp reviews and there wasn't much to complain about.  The Gabardine is located in downtown Toronto; so, prepare yourself to find a place to park that costs a billion dollars.  Luckily, there is a surface lot around the block that costs $10C on the weekends.  This is a very unassuming place; you wouldn't think of this place as a great dine in establishment.  The place is narrow and small, with a dark setting and a small bar.  Seating was tight and we were only able to land 3 stool seats at the bar, right by the front door (it was cold!!!).    After ordering something to wet my whistle, I browsed the menu for something to mellow my hunger pains.  The menu is very simple, appetizers, salads, sandwiches and mains.  A few items caught my eye, which I ordered; the chicken liver pate and the fish pie (yes, FISH PIE!).    The pate was great!  Served on a small plate with crispy toast and house pickles.  Very creamy and quite tasty; not as liver tasting as many people would think.  It's a great starter for those with a little bit of adventure!  The fish pie arrived and came packed with with clams, mussels, haddock, smoked trout on a bed of mashed potato and a buttermilk biscuit.  Let me tell you, this was an amazing dish and even more amazing if you're a seafood fan.  What an amazing collision of flavors, starch and fresh seafood.  The creamy sauce is something else!  You have to try this dish, I promise you won't be disappointed.    My co-worker got the Roasted Brined Pork Chop.  This is no small chop that you'd expect to get; this was a monster chop, about 2 inches thick, served on sautéed kale and split peas.  I tried it and it's another item you simply have to order!!!  Don't kid yourself, find time to make your way to this hidden establishment of downtown Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"I started yelping restaurants a couple weeks before my Toronto trip and bookmarked Gabardine. I went here with a friend on a weekday for lunch at around 12pm. It was very crowded but we only had to wait about 15 minutes. We sat in the back corner and it was cozy. We ordered the shrimp po 'boy, deviled eggs, and maple cretons with toast. The maple cretons were ok. It honestly didn't have much flavor to it. The deviled eggs were tasty but definitely not the best deviled eggs I've had. The shrimp po'boy looked amazing but when it came down to taste, the jam was a little too sweet for me and the shrimps were super tiny after biting into all that breading. Overall, the food was just \"fine\". The service was good and the dishes came out quickly. If I'm ever in Toronto and go to Gabardine again, I'll try the cocktails instead. The atmosphere was great so that's something to at least check out. Prices were a little high for lunch, we spent about $45."}
{"text":"The Gabardine is a cozy little spot serving up nostalgic dishes in downtown Toronto. I would make a reservation as it's a pretty popular lunch spot and they don't have a lot of space.   Now there's tons of stuff on the menu but please disregard all of it and go straight for the Mac & Cheese. It is probably the best Mac & Cheese I've ever had and the ultimate comfort dish. Be prepared for the rich and gooey cheese, I would suggest adding the smoked ham as it helps cut the richness down but not the sodium so drink lots of water after.   You obviously shouldn't have it everyday but if you are craving good mac & cheese then I would only suggest The Gabardine.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"It was packed when we got here! Thank god we made reservations! We got our appetizers and drinks pretty quickly, but our Main dishes took a really long time to come! It was really busy, but it would have been nice if the servers acknowledged the long wait time for our food.   Chicken pâté was amazing! My fave dish!   Devilled eggs -very creamy, but I found it too salty  Chicken sandwich - the chicken was deep fried and very good! Nicely spiced.   Fish taco - the wraps were dry, but the deep fried fish was nice and tender. The sauce was interesting. It seemed to have indian spices in it. This wasn't good in my opinion. Will pass on it next time.  Pork sandwich - not bad. Very tender.   Lemon pancotta - this was ok. Nothing special.   Overall, I would come back for the pâté and chicken sandwich, and to try their infamous Mac and cheese and chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"An overcooked burger is not a crime. Hipster meets financial district vibe, quite welcoming actually, staff in depeche mode t-shirts chattering about power-pop bands they know around the edges of working. Good service, very attentive. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, medium-rare, and fries. The fries were very good. The burger looked good, and probably would have been very tasty. Alas, it was beyond well done -- not only not pink, but hard, so that cutting with a knife required some pressure. Given that the cheese was also a bit congealed, I had the sense that it had been sitting under a heat lamp (or perhaps not under a heat lamp) for a little while. I pointed this out to the very nice guy who was serving me, and he went back and told the kitchen, I think. He certainly recognized that I'd ordered a medium-rare burger and received something else. An overcooked burger is not a crime, but my bill was $22 for just the burger and fries. Add $4 for a tip (do you penalize the staff for the kitchen's error and we are up to $26. At that price, and with the pretensions the Gabardine has to foody-ism, it's not acceptable."}
{"text":"Fish pie.  Fish pie?  It's not something you see on a dinner menu every day, but the Gabardine's got it. And if you have a thing for rich and creamy comfort food, you should consider trying it. I'm writing this review during an ass-kicking cold-spell in t.o. so this dish hit the spizzot.  Fish pie. Actually, it's not so much a pie as a stew. They even ask if you'd prefer to eat it with a spoon (I did, obvs) since it's served in a bowl and appears to be more of a soupy concoction consisting of mussels and clams, with bits of haddock and smoked trout, served alongside/atop creamy mashed potatoes and accompanied by a wicked buttermilk biscuit. Dude, FISH PIE. Reeeally good, filling dish.  Cocktail creations are also legit. Cool little place, too. I'll be back to taste more menu items.....if, that is, I can resist ordering the fish pie again :)"}
{"text":"Good hearty Canadian (soul?) food! I'm a fan of their burger, mac & cheese and shrimp po boy. The location is very convenient for those working in the financial district. Be prepared to wait for a table if you go during peak hours. It seems like they cater towards the working crowd as they do not open on weekends."}
{"text":"I really enjoy restaurants with an intimate setting. The Gabardine was just that, cozy with beautiful lights decorating the ceiling. Their food was good too, our group ordered the fish tacos, chicken pot pie and pork katsu. All delicious. We shared the sticky toffee pudding which was amazing! The cake was fresh baked and served soft and warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was the perfect ending!"}
{"text":"Delicious fried fish sandwich with a house-made bread, tamarind sauce, and shredded  cabbage. Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Such a welcome surprise in a sea of suits! It's hard to believe this little gem of a resto can be found on Bay Street. The setting is shabby chic and a complete foil to its surroundings.  I would describe the menu as upscale comfort food but without the upscale price tag. All dishes are under $20, and given the dimension of the ingredients, it's quite good value. I have never had a bad experience in the three times I've eaten here and can recommend the mac and cheese, the spare ribs, fish tacos, and a number of the starters. The signature cocktail is also lovely!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here just before 1pm on a Wednesday. It was definitely after the usual lunch rush, so there weren't too many customers. However, service was still a tad slow, and I think that's the main reason this is not a 5/5.  I ordered the Colombian chorizo pork patty with french roll, queso fresco, mayo & aji. I'm usually not crazy about sandwiches, but this one had plenty of flavour, and managed to win me over. You have the option of fries or salad on the side, and combined with our sandwiches, it was quite a hefty lunch. My friends ordered the club house and grilled cheese, and neither were able to finish.   Given its convenient location, I will likely return to try some other items."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this place. The food was good, there was a nice ambience and lovely decor, but the server we had was quite rude. I came here for my birthday celebration, and he was snippy with us the entire time, and as the bill was being paid he made a snarky comment about the tip that was left. The bill was split up into three, and each person tipped on their portion which I guess he didn't think was enough and told us so in a very rude way. It was an honest mistake, and we would have been happy to add more if he had mentioned it nicely, and also hadn't been so unpleasant during our time there.   Ended a nice celebratory evening on a sour note and I don't know if I will return because of this."}
{"text":"Aww man I so wanted to love this place--but everything about it was so mediocre and so overpriced. I ordered the negroni and the famous mac and cheese with ham, my friend ordered the taco salad and the thyme lemonade. The drinks were honestly pretty bad...would not recommend. The taco salad was your average salad and the mac and cheese was your average mac and cheese...with ham. Total after tax and tip was over $85. I WANTED TO LOVE YOU GABARDINE, but alas, it was not meant to be."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick hang sesh with my 2 friends and thought that the plave had a great ambience. Dimly lit room, with somewhat classy decor.  Now the food - I wasn't blown away with the chicken pot pie I had.. it ws a little too soupy for my liking and the flavor wasnt amazing. I also dont like the fact that it was made in a glass bowl, when the crust is one of the components to look forward to.  My friends had the same thoughts about what they had. One of them had the Southern Fried Chicken Thigh sandwich and the other had Trinidadian Geera Pork sandwich.  I wasn't particularly impressed by the service either. The server I had was very cold and was almost rushing us out.   Probably won't be coming back.. everything was very meh."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's pub food/comfort food, but done so right, at a good price, in a great atmosphere. I think it's huge with the business crowd for lunch, but I've just been here a few times for dinner. So far I've tried: - Sirloin and bacon burger - Trinidadian jerk pork sandwich - Chicken pot pie - Mac and cheese - Caesar salad  I honestly could find no fault with any of it, loved every dish. However, I gave 4 stars because I told myself I should be more \"discriminating\" with my reviews....  oh well the heck I'll go with 5 stars, this place totally deserves it."}
{"text":"I obviously ordered the wrong thing. I picked the po boy and wasn't impressed at all, the sandwich tasted mostly like pickles and tomatoes in a plain bun. The fried haddock was visually there, but tasted non-existent. It didn't even give me another layer of texture from the fish being fried. I was sad for it, but mainly sad for my bad choice of an entree. The dish was only saved by the side of well executed fries. They were done to perfection and was my favorite thing from my whole plate.   Luckily I came with good friends that let me freely stab at their dishes. The main theme for the better life choices was that they were all very rich dishes. The mac and cheese is creamy and decadent, one bite was enough for me to know that I would not be able to eat much of it. My friend only got through half of it before she tapped out. Maybe this dish would be better for sharing between two people instead of one main dish? The burger was apparently small but delicious, so it was also a good choice. The pot pie is indulgent, with plenty of vegetables and meat in a thick white sauce topped with a flaky pastry hat. If I could rewind and do this meal over again, this would be my first choice. I will try it again on another day and hopefully make better choices."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The $13 cheese balls tasted like wasabi to me? Way overpriced. The mac & cheese was good though, very filling. Split it with a friend and was still satisfied.  Ambience is more than \"casual\", but nothing too fancy.  Since the space is so small, it feels intimate.   Strangely, the place was fully booked on a Tuesday evening! My friend and I had to get seats at the bar at just 5pm."}
{"text":"I came here with a coworker on a work trip to Toronto, and thought it was a cute, fun, hip place. The selection on the menu definitely skews towards the not-as-healthy, so don't expect to stick to a diet when you come here. I'd recommend sharing dishes; we shared 3 appetizers and 1 entree (burger).  Deep Fried Beer Cheese Croquettes ($13) - A bit on the pricey side for basically, 4 cheese sticks, but these are every bit as delicious as they sound. The cheese inside is not gooey and stringy like a mozzarella stick, but instead it's a mix of 3 cheeses. It's a softer texture (simliar to pub cheese), and deep fried to perfection and served with a sweet maple sauce on the side. I'd highly recommend these.  Roasted Beet & Farro Salad ($15) - They took something healthy (beets and farro) and then made it unhealthy by putting it atop cream cheese (yes, my comment about this restaurant being not-healthy rings true with this dish). It was delicious though - the beets were fresh, the farro was crunchy and it had great flavor.  Smoked Trout Dish ($16) - I imagined something much different than this when I ordered it. It reminded me of a coleslaw with a piece of smoked trout on top.  The smoked trout on top was delicious, but the rest was had too much mayo. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't my type of dish.  Sirloin Bacon Cheeseburger ($18) - This came with fries which were good (and slightly sweetened in a good way). The burger was not really one of my favorites. I love burgers, but the patty was disproportionate to the rest of the toppings & bun, and a bit on the thick side so it was hard to eat. They also had too much aioli on the burger, and I didn't end up eating the bun. The patty was too gamey for my liking and on the dry side. I wouldn't get this again.  All in all, I would give this 3.5 stars. Stick to the unhealthy options and I think you'll be fine. The croquettes are a must-have and if I'm back again, I'll try the chicken pot pie. It's a fun place to come with some friends and share a bunch of dishes."}
{"text":"I made the rookie mistake of coming here the week of TIFF not making a reservation because I thought \"oh it's only Wednesday night, it's not going to be busy!\". I was wrong. It was still very busy but luckily they slipped me in with the caveat that they needed the table back in less than 2 hrs.  Waitress was super friendly and very attentive. Always ensured our drinks were topped up and checked in with us regularly.  In terms of food, I would highly recommend the chicken liver paté with apple butter and toast - so good! I got the cod po boy which wasn't bad and my friend got the catch of the day. We got the peach pie to finish but I found the crust too hard to even cut through. Still delicious though! This place is pretty loud though so I had to talk loudly to be heard."}
{"text":"Fine grub... is how the Gabardine's menu describes its offerings. And yes, it's definitely more than just fine. Located just south of Bay Street and Queen Street, roughly on the southwest corner, this place epitomizes the meeting of hipster and suits in one spot. Very casual atmosphere, with the Bay Street crowd dropping by at peak meal hours.   We were a group of 6 that visited on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 PM - note that they take reservations for dinner. It's a very narrow space with limited seating, so make sure you call ahead and book a reservation earlier than later.  First, the parking situation. Basically, it's limited. There are some lots in the area, but very limited street parking in the vicinity (even less at a reasonable rate). There is, however, parking at a $4.00 lot about a 10 minute walk away, just east of Yonge Street.  Second, the service. Nice staff - definitely not conversationalists by any means, but they got the job done. They were a little slower towards the end of our meal when the restaurant was at capacity (understandable), and it did take awhile to split our bill since they initially delivered just one bill for all 6 of us. Overall, it looks like service slows down significantly when it gets busier (no surprise, but not very convenient when you're in a hurry).  Third, the food. The menu has a pretty decent variety of food and drinks. If you're looking for something health-conscious, you'll find limited options to your liking in this menu. They offer genuine comfort food, albeit at a higher price point. We ordered: a) the Mac and Chese with Smoked Ham on top ($19.00), and b) the Sirloin Cheeseburger with Fries ($20.00).   The Mac and Cheese was deeeeelicious, but may not be for everyone. It isn't thick and creamy like some people are used to - instead, the sauce is a little milkier and looser. It's topped with herbed breadcrumbs and the pasta itself is super soft. The flavours made me smile and was super comforting to me - I absolutely loved it, but again, not for everyone. The burger was also delicious - it's definitely pricier than your usual burger and fries combo, but the meat is delicious and definitely top quality. We just didn't like the fries - really oily, soggy, and not crispy at all. Pass on the fries if you can.  Overall, delicious. A great contrast to all the other offerings in the Financial District. And I'll definitely be back for more Mac and Cheese.  For the two dishes (no drinks), with tax and tip, the total was around $51.00."}
{"text":"Every time I lookup for a good place to grab dinner at downtown Toronto I always see The Gabardine popping up on Yelp. The reviews looked great, the food looked warm and hearty, so on a cold weekday night I dropped by this restaurant with a friend. This place is located right next to the 7-11 that I always go to for my usual fix of cheap XL coffee.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese with ham on top and the chicken pot pie, they each costed around $20. I was actually looking to order the chicken waffle but they no longer offer that :( Mac and Cheese was amazing. It was warm, creamy, and I liked crunchy burnt areas. Best Mac and Cheese I have ever tried. I liked the pastry crust of the chicken pot pie, however the soup was just alright...still bumped out not getting the chicken waffle boooo.  There was actually a time limit on your table of one and a half hour. We came at around 5:15 and were told we could stay until 6:30. It was quiet when we sat down and I could tell the restaurant getting busier as our time limit approaches. Eventually people had to wait for a table when we left.   Still can't get over the fact that chicken waffle is gone from their menu for good. Well guess it's time to try out other places"}
{"text":"Recommended. Great food. Great service. Excellent cocktails. Mac and cheese to die for. Peanut butter ice-cream dessert likewise. Everything we ordered was terrific. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I might be over-generous here, but I had the Philly Steak (waiter's suggestion) and it was a really good meal.  Salad was fresh and delicious as well. The wait staff were unreasonably pleasant and attentive, which may just be a Canadian thing.  I try to reserve 5 stars for only the cream of the crop but this is exactly the kind of place I love.  Tiny, quirky, and tasty."}
{"text":"Stumbled by here one Saturday evening with my sister & decided to check this place out.  Immediately greeted at the door by some very friendly staff & seated promptly. The staff were absolutely awesome the entire time - attentive, helpful, and sweet.  My sister is currently preggo, so I opted to join her in a non-alcoholic Shirley Temple. Delicious! Though I suppose it's hard to get a Shirley Temple wrong!  Started off with the deep fried beer cheese croquettes with maple mustard. Came hot, gooey, and crispy! The maple mustard was AMAZING. Seriously, I wanted to bottle it up and take it home.  My sister & I split a cesar salad & the deep fried cheese salad. The cesar salad was very fresh and yummy with the bacon still warm. It came with some cold soft cooked eggs which is a nice touch to change the cesar up a bit.  I don't know who came up with the idea for the fried cheese salad but they clearly win at life :P. We devoured that thing. Even though the cheese is fried, the salad & dressing are nice & light so the meal doesn't weigh you down too much. Portion sizes for both salads were very good.  Finished off with the peanut butter & jelly pie with chocolate toasted walnuts. Oh. my. god. I'm not a big pie person normally but WOW - Foodgasm! Just try it - that's all I can say (and really, who isn't a PB&J fan!?) :).  I don't really have a single complaint about The Gabardine - really, just stellar service, great food, and overall awesomeness. I will most certainly be back :)."}
{"text":"Any place on Bay street that makes you feel like you're eating at home, is a place worth visiting.   I have been sitting at the bar at The Gabardine for more than half a year now, either sipping a latte, london fog, or munching down the occasional croissant. Their espressos stand out against the sea of Starbucks (using Rufino Espresso beans, if anyone cares) and Sonny pulls a mean espresso.   But the problem was I had never ventured in for dinner, since the place always seemed overloaded. A few days ago I finally decided to meet a friend for dinner. True to their nature and as a testament to their uniqueness, they were fully booked by 6pm. We sat at the bar, not far from where I usually linger, and enjoyed a feast for the ages.   We started with the rabbit rillettes with sour cherry preserve and toasts. The preserve was delicious and did not overpower the rillette. A nice touch was the inclusion of a few caper berries that added a nice salty sourness to our appetizer.   For mains we had the shrimp po boy and special of the day - fish tacos, thinking we could compare seafood and juggle between heavy and light. It was served with a heaping salad of butter lettuce, lightly dressed and almost falling off the plate. The french bread was strong enough to keep its fillings in, but so soft it melted in your mouth! The aioli and sauce on the po boys definitely blew us away. The fish tacos came in threes with a light side of potato salad. Both yukon and purple potatoes were used, which was a bonus; I love purple potatoes. The tacos were topped with pickled cabbage and assorted veggies. It was hard to pick out everything due to the dim lighting. I've had better spiced tacos, but this was a solid main.   For dessert...we ate air. Unfortunately by the time I enthusiastically asked about the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich, they were sold out. This was ~8pm! Note to others, order this early in your meal! It was just as well, since my companion and I had already filled up on beverages.   On the subject of libations (it is in their slogan), the bar is stacked with your standard spirits - heavy on the Italian side. Their draught beer list doesn't seem to vary from the 4 offerings: Sleeman's original, Sapporo, Okanagan Spring Ale and Blanche de Chambly. They also serve Q water, a filtration system attached to tap water. Their caesar was delicious, rimmed with a celery salt that seemed to taste not as overpowering as commercial ones and added plenty of horseradish.   As we were sitting at the bar, we were served frequently and got to see the wait staff's meticulous execution of drinks. It's a pleasure to see staff busting their behinds to serve patrons well-executed simple cooking - truly an intoxicating experience."}
{"text":"Had their Mac N Cheese with Ham. The Ham was kind of bland and the Mac N Cheese was much more salty than it was creamy. Average Mac N Cheese despite all the rave reviews. For $19, I expect something much better.  Their cheeseburger was pretty good. Moist and tasty. But the fries that came with it tasted like they have been sitting around for a long time before being served.   Service was fine.  Overall, a bit disappointed. This place is over hyped."}
{"text":"The stellar reviews led me to believe I'd be eating dinner at a premium restaurant; what I found instead was a restaurant trying too hard.  I had the pan seared black cod with braised lentils and mushrooms.  The chef undoubtedly has talent, as the black cod was seared crispy on top and extremely delicate.  The presentation was also exquisite.  But, the fish was masked by an extremely salty sauce, and it sat on a bed of under-cooked lentils.  After adding in a glass of wine, my individual meal stood at almost $40... this is not good value."}
{"text":"The last time we came here, it was because we were craving mac and cheese and chicken pie. I didn't need to think long before I said, I know exactly where to go.  I used to love the Gabardine and would come here just for the chicken pot pie...and other times just for the mac & cheese. OK, I might have on occasion come in for both at the same time even.  I had forgotten how cramp the space is. And how dark it is. The tables are very close to one another and it's seemingly always busy though. We were lucky though, and didn't have to wait long to get seated.   After placing our order and me raving about how good it is here, we got our meal!  Maybe it was an off night, or maybe I had hyped it up too much, but both tasted fairly average. The mac-and-cheese, we thought didn't taste gourmet at all. It was similar in taste to stuff from the box this time. My chicken pot pie was OK, though it wasn't piping hot. It was luke-warm at best and tasted average as well. The portion, fortunately, was not very large but we didn't even finish it.  We were a little disappointed, especially given the price ($21 for the mac-and-cheese and $24 for the chicken pot pie). Service was OK, though the waitress didn't come by very often. After taxes + tip, the meal was about $58 or so. Not sure what happened here. I remembered that it used to be so good."}
{"text":"Holy cow is this place good. Fast and friendly service and amazing food. Boyfriend got the steak and fries, which he said was delicious and I got the zucchini and mint risotto (the risotto changes daily). We also ordered the beer cheese croquettes with the honey mustard dipping sauce - LIFE CHANGING. I would come here specifically for them. Loved the open kitchen concept because you could actually see the chefs making the food. Good tap list. The ambience was also nice. Location is not far from some attractions which is good because we were able to walk back to our hotel relatively quickly. Had to knock off a star because our server forgot we ordered the appetizer but quickly changed that and brought us one (sadly while we were eating our meal already though). Overall a great experience and would come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic night. Our waiter never let our glasses get half full and our food was out in no time. We ate at the table near the kitchen and got to see the amazing food. I have the chicken pot pie and boy would my mom be upset. The food was full of flavor and was cooked just right. They are excellent cooks here I as a visitor of the city I recommend anyone who is not from the area or that someone who is in the area regularly should eat here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"So, I've been dying to come here for forever (as it consistently makes the list for places that you have to eat in Toronto), so full disclosure, maybe I was a little biased.   The restaurant is small, and very cozy with a mixed crowd of families, business people and foodie hipsters. However, despite the mixed bag of patrons, the prices are very distinctly downtown Toronto prices. Cocktails are the expected ~$15, and food isn't cheap either. The cocktails are good, but nothing too exciting.   Coming here, we had to try the mac and cheese and the chicken pot pie. We also got the friend cauliflower (I think that's what it was), and a french onion soup. I will start with the most exciting and go to least. The cauliflower was good, and had nice sauces to accompany it! The mac and cheese and the chicken pot pie both tasted like they had the same base cream sauce (which they very well might), but that was thoroughly disappointing. They were too creamy, and there were no other notes of anything. It just tasted like a rough with heavy cream on top of noodles, or with chicken chunks and some veggies, but it drowned out all the natural flavours of the other ingredients. The most offensive (in my opinion) was the french onion soup. This is probably one of my favourite foods for the classic oven soup dishes that have bread and melted cheese atop an onion soup. What I got was a shallow soup dish with lukewarm (let me say for the umpteenth time that only bodily fluids and pee pools are lukewarm) with a small baguette round sprinkled with melted cheese...SO WRONG.  Will I be coming back? Only for alcohol, and even then, in a city like Toronto, there are always better places to drink."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie here is fairly decent and the mac n cheese was good. If you go with the mac n cheese be sure to order it with the ham. Portions are very substantial and you leave feeling full. The beer options were a little sparse and it isn't a large place so you're sitting in tight quarters. Service was good in my experience. I will likely stop in here on a monthly basis since it's close to work."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice night out here tonight. Cozy place with great food.  We enjoyed many things, some with the help of the reviews here: Cauliflower - get this. Amazing Deep fried jalapeño cheese bites - delicious Chicken liver - I did not partake but it was well liked. Two of us split the pot pie and a Caesar salad. So good and a whole pie would have been very heavy Two enjoyed the risotto special One had skirt steak Can't recall the other Add some drinks  Only thing that surprised was that they had already added gratuity and we were only six people. ~420 all in."}
{"text":"Every time I walked on Bay St down to Union Station, I would pass by this restaurant. It looked cute and people in their seemed to be enjoying themselves, and also almost always full. Tonight I got to try this place. I ordered the cod po' boy sandwich with fries and my friend ordered the chicken pot pie! Even though my sandwich was good , I think I will order the chicken pot pie next time.  My cod sandwich was served on a hot dog style bun with one lettuce leaf, pieces of crispy seasoned cod, topped with sweet tomato relish. The sandwich was tasty  and the fries were average. My friend's chicken pot pie was buttery yumminess. The pot pie was very rich and delicious.   As I was exiting the restaurant I saw an order of rissotto which also looked very good! Prepare to spend around $20 on food plus additional for drinks."}
{"text":"Second time here and I enjoyed myself. Tiny restaurant located in the financial district, it's a great spot for dinner after work. It's probably a good idea to make reservations. The service was fine.  Mac N Cheese: this is a must try, big portions and tasty. Get it with the smoked bacon. It's heavy though!  Chicken pot pie: just as tasty, the pot pie is really hearty and I was stuffed after eating it.  Both dishes are the highlights based on other reviews and I agree. Give this place a shot. I'll visit again!"}
{"text":"the food here is hit or miss.  table had the liver mousse, korean cauliflower, burger, chicken thigh sandwich and fish tacos.  mousse and cauliflower were great but a little overpriced for what you get.  it was agreed that all the mains were below expectations - burger was very salty and way too much mayo, fish tacos were pretty bland and 2 for $17 is a bit steep although the pieces of fish were pretty big, and the chicken sandwich needed the hot sauce or else is was just meh.  seems this is another restaurant in the financial district that survives off location rather than quality of dishes."}
{"text":"Service: The servers were kinda short and curt. If you're going to move chairs around LIFT do not drag them.   Food: Kinda pricey...I had the pork chop, it sounded delish but the flavours were kinda flat and boring, needed more seasoning.   Dessert: rum cake..couldn't really taste any rum, also flavours were flat, BTW if you serve a dessert with custard, I need a spoon please."}
{"text":"I really liked the Gabardine! Food was delicious and well-priced for the area. I will definitely go back and look forward to trying more of the menu.  Even on weeknight this place was packed - reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere. The beer-fried cheese was phenomenal."}
{"text":"The fish tacos here are excellent! That said, the portions are pretty tiny, you'd be wise to order an appetizer in addition to your entrée. I came here for dinner on a Friday night without a reservation and suggest you make one if you're planning to arrive later than 6 pm. It gets very crowded!   What strikes me about this place is how it feels more like a casual diner than a fancy Bay St bistro, but the quality of the food is excellent and the cocktail list looks promising (I didn't try any on my first visit). I'd like to come back here for a late lunch or earlier dinner to escape the crowds. The noise level is deafening when this place fills up!"}
{"text":"Deep fried beer cheese - very soft on the inside. Soft deep fried batter on the outside is just the right thickness to hold shape until you bite into it. Enjoy it for its texture and smoothness.  The mac and cheese was good. If you pull up a string of cheese on your fork, you can spin it around endlessly. The smoked ham was good, but I wish I saved the $2 so I could better appreciate the crust. There were two distinct sauces in the mac and cheese, a stringier layer of cheese on top and a creamy sauce that the macaroni was in. The mac and cheese was great but I wasn't blown away like I was with the deep fried beer cheese.  Hard to find at street level but it might just be the scaffolding from (temporary) construction. Doors into office building for 372 Bay St locked and entrance nearby inconspicuous. Look for the fancy people dining on the SW corner Bay and Richmond, heading South on Bay looking West through the windows of 372 Bay St.  The restaurant was VERY warm. I'm not sure what the reason for that was.  They take reservations. They take credit card. There is no wifi."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place and have tried virtually everything on the menu.  The food is truly great here - simple, hearty and fresh with enough complexity and flavor to satisfy the foodie in anyone.  Today I had one of the best chicken soups I've ever tried.  Day after day they keep the hits coming.  What a great. Cozy place in an otherwise very business like part of town."}
{"text":"Visited the Gaberdine after seeing a segment on You Gotta Eat Here (well, rather that a segment was coming up, but I never made it back after the commercial - the idea of a segment was enough to hook me.) I was nervous about the dress code as it's a flashy diner in the financial district and I was going for lunch on a workday. When we arrived at 1pm the spot was rammed to the gills with suits, but quickly emptied out by 2pm and allowed us a quiet environment to enjoy our food.  I got the Arctic Char with Sour Cream Mash and Red Cabbage Slaw. At a pricy $26 for the lunch portion, I was pretty impressed. The fish was flavourful and flaky, and the sour cream mash was creamy and added a different flare to the typical mashed potatoes. The only thing that really turned me off was the $3.50 can of coke I was served. For $3.50, you would assume that it's an AYCD deal. I guess the highball glass with a lime wedge they served it with warranted the extra $2.50, who knows. That said, I'm glad I didn't shy away from wearing my comfortable neon runners after all.   Not sure if I would try this place again, unless it was for the comfort food like mac and cheese or po-boy that they're supposedly known for.  It was just-OK, and in a city like Toronto, there's just too much choice to not have a meal your your little world."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and location.  It is always busy here and sometimes hard to get a table. Got po boy and chicken pot pie. Loved it! Quite heavy. But delicious  i think i would only come here once though."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's pricey but the food and the ambience is worth it!   Amazing mac and cheese (with huge chunks of ham), really great cocktails.  This is a great morning place as well to go for a cafe au lait and a croissant or pain au chocolat.  Really romantic/European feel."}
{"text":"If there was a no star option, it still wouldn't be low enough. The poor customer service says it all.  Had the worst customer service in a Toronto restaurant today, and I've seen some doozies.  I took time out my busy work day to call this place. My first call was made at 930am, where I left a message as instructed for reservations tonight. As the day went on, and no response from the restaurant, I called another 3 times. (Annoying enough they don't even pick up when you call, at least get OpenTable or something)  They finally decided to returned my call after the fourth time, around 3-4pm, and said they were fully booked. when i said \"am i one of those bookings, i left a message\" they said \"we've been fully booked for hours\".  Once I informed them I left my reservation this morning, she sounded surprised, put me on hold for one minute, dismissed the fact that I had called in the morning, still saying they were fully booked with no other explanations. I then asked her how one goes about booking a reservation, all I heard was dead silence on the other side of the phone because the broad hung up on me.  I live in the area with my girlfriend. We were thrilled to try out this place. Perhaps making it a regular spot to dine. Not anymore...."}
{"text":"Tight quarters, cool atmosphere. Food was delicious, service was ok (it was really busy so it was tough to get someone's attention) Small menu, but very well done."}
{"text":"This was an absolute pleasure of an experience. First, the decor is amazing. It is a warm, romantic, and inviting space with great little touches like the gorgeous tin ceiling. It is whimsical and totally unexpected for a place at Richmond and Bay. Second, the service was great - attentive, thoughtful, and prompt. Finally, the FOOD WAS FANTASTIC. We had the ploughman's platter which was elegantly served and full of amazing treats. My mac and cheese was awesome and the beef stroganoff my friend had was perfect.  The burnt marshmellow sandwich for dessert cannot be missed. This place is a great addition to the restaurants downtown and would be perfect for a pre-theater dinner or just a romantic dinner downtown after work. It is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch on a friday and there was a line up inside the restaurant.  We stood near the door and right in front of the bar behind a couple expecting someone to tell us how long we need to wait for. After a good 7-8 minutes of waiting and the waiters at the bar seeing us standing there, a waitress finally came up to us and asked how many people and told us how long the wait will be.  The actual wait was not too long, maybe about 5 minutes. Our server took our order and our food arrived quickly. We got the chicken pot pie and the tacos. Chicken pot pie was average, liked the tacos a bit more. There was nothing that stood out with the taste. On the other hand, although the portions are not huge, they do give you a decent amount of chicken and fish.   No service during our meal. Had my water pour twice from behind my back. Did not see a single smiling face from the people who work there...would rather go to food court for better service."}
{"text":"The price range definitely is pricely (yelp shows $$ right now, should be $$$) - the $30-$60 range is more like what you will end up spending.  Accidentally stumbling in a higher price range would make you hope for better service, alas i got frowning/tired/busy staff and one was busy texting while standing right in front of me.  Kinda disappointment, would be ok if the prices would be down a notch."}
{"text":"Reading negative reviews on a place is sometimes comical. Comments like the small space at the front door or how tight everything is. ITS A SMALL DINER!! Saying that the staff member with the suit throws me off. Food was fresh and tasty and the atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Had the fried cheese in beer croquettes as an app, a little pricey but very tasty. Chicken pot pie for my entre which was so hot but really great. My mom had the fish tacos which were very fresh and flavorful. Definitely recommend going here, but I'd suggest making a reservation because it got very busy very quickly."}
{"text":"I like that it's a new addition to a fairly monotone formulaic strip. I like that it's welcoming and warm and cozy. I like that the servers are grown up hipsters. I like that its got dim lighting and mismatched plates.  But that's about it. I don't really like the menu all that much and i don't really like the smell of deep fry oil wafting in the air."}
{"text":"I may come back and update this if/when I go again but my initial visit here was underwhelming.   Granted I didn't get any of their staple dishes but had the deviled eggs (way too much mayo/cream), Caesar salad (drenched in dressing) and butternut squash soup (above average).   Sandwiches that others had looked pretty good so will give that a try next time."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group of about 10 people here mid April.  Everyone enjoyed their food and service was excellent. Nice atmosphere and it was bustling for a Tuesday evening.  I had the burger which was dee-lish. Generous portions so makes the slightly higher price for a burger worth it.    Only drawback was that this place needs better ventilation / fumehood.  We all came out smelling strongly of grease from the fryers. Had to dry clean my jacket afterward so I would not go back unless I was wearing all machine washable clothing!"}
{"text":"Saw The Gaberdine on t.v. And read most of the review; it seems like a promising restaurant.  Came here when they just opened they were still setting up the restaurant. With most of the staff on it seems odd that candles were not lit and were just getting lit on all tables when we were having our appetizer. But anyway staff seems to be well bonded since they were taking photos at the bar. Not sure if that was good or what but it was distracting for me. The ambiance of the whole restaurant was great clean and simple .... Had a small open kitchen concept which is always good to see. For the app we ordered the beer cheese croquettes served with maple mustard. Came with four pinky sized cheese sticks for $13 very very expensive. People said its worth it so we tried it. These cheese sticks were very disappointing, not hot in the middle but warm for the cheese to melt.  Light beer flavoured cheese, would enjoy a normal mozzarella stick over these croquettes. Adding on, the sauce doesnt help because it just over powers the whole stick, too sweet.... 1/5stars We ordered the mac and cheese, it looks promising, i was thinking this has to be worth it being a $17 mac and cheese,  which was alright, the bread crumbs parm crust was a good addition to the flavor and texture, it also had a little zing of garlic in the crust. But for $17 i dont think its worth coming back for. 2.5/5 stars Next we ordered the fried chicken and waffle. $26. Yeah......$26.....!! Served with sausage gravy, maple syrup and iceberg tossed in buttermilk ranch. This dish looked good. I love the whole breakfast dinner concept of comfort food. The chicken was good nice crispy chicken, the waffles were soggy and dense not what i was expecting. Sausage gravy was very light in flavor and needs more flavor.  Over all this dish was ok but i would rather have stockyards chicken and waffles anytime compared to these. Price , flavor, and waffle.  2/5stars  Service was poor since we didnt even know what a servers name is he'd rather talk to the other workers i guess, didnt recommend anything , didnt say the daily specials which is pretty standard, water was piss warm, we werent ask if we want desserts not that i wanted to spend more for mediocre food. So disappointing . 0/5 star what service again?!? Sucks because its a custom to pay 15%.   Over all i wont be going back to the gaberdine and wont be recommending it to others , its over priced mediocre food and poor service! Id rather spend my money else where.    Save your money and avoid The Gaberdine.  Paid $85 for 1 app 2 entrees and a beer."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little spot in downtown Toronto. The Mac and cheese was killer. Nice little restaurant that serves a lot of good dishes. The burger was awesome and fresh, the pot pie looks incredible and the drinks are very good. They have a house old fashion that takes the cake."}
{"text":"VIBE  This café is in my old work stomping grounds and it is really refreshing to see something (relatively) new on the Bay Street scene that welcomes in their customers and is affordable. I was immediately struck by the white walls and how it encompasses how bright and airy this place is. When I came in to meet my best friend after work, the place was relatively packed and it seems like The Gabardine is a place that is usually always crowded. It definitely felt like that when the gentleman beside me was eavesdropping on my conversation or when we noticed the 25 inches of space between the bar and my friend's chair. After the eavesdropper left, it was the perfect venue to catch up with the bestie, but there were a lot of coworkers and friends hanging out here as well. It's classy without being pretentious and it's exactly what the opera crowd needs (well, at least the middle class opera crowd).   WE ATE  Due to the impending doom of fall beckoning earlier sunsets, we were craving comfort food. We started with the sweet corn hushpuppies with buttermilk poppy seed dressing. The hushpuppies are essentially fried dough and they were cooked well, but I wish I had some bread to dip that poppy seed dressing. Yum. I ordered the mac n' cheese because you can't go wrong with a white cheddar baked mac n' cheese. It filled the comfort food gap but it was a bit too cheesy for me - as in it was just oozing everywhere. It was too much. I tasted my friend's pot pie and it had a bit more flavor than my mac n' cheese but it also seemed to be overly gooey. They were both large portions and we were stuffed by the end. I will return but I wouldn't order either of these items. I know many are raving about the po' boy and think I will try that instead. I'd also like to try their cocktails next time.  A note:  Is it just me or is it awkward getting to the bathroom? I felt like I was going to the staff room on the way there.   Another note: those mix n match flowered plates are awfully cute! It reminds me of going to Grandmother's house.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  The Gabardine lets you chat and chew in a cozy setting that makes me feel like I could call this my \"regular.\" Minus the calling out of \"NORM!\" but of course. Cheers, this café aint."}
{"text":"We went during lunch time around 11:45am and waited for an hour for a table for 3. A table for 2 would be a 30 min wait.  Go before 11:30am to avoid the wait.  There's no reservation for lunch time.  The food was great.  The mac n cheese with ham was bomb.  The chicken pot pie n salad were good but mac n cheese is a must order. Their sandwiches look very crispy and juicy. I would order them next time.  Good service."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in the ironically culinary void of the entertainment district. The atmosphere is very cute and quirky. We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed with the post work business crowd. The menu is small and mostly new takes on classic comfort food. We had the chicken pot pie, which was large but pretty tasteless and a fish pie (fish special) which was quite nice. The portions are large and reasonably priced. The cocktail menu is interesting, and the service was quick but quite cold.  Worth a venture if you're in the neighborhood but not worth traveling for."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this quaint little place for a small and quick dinner on Friday evening. They were pretty packed and barely managed to squeeze us in as we didn't have a reservation, but they were definitely very accommodating.   ATMOSPHERE: This place is so quaint and cute and I love the vibe! There were a million little string lights coating the ceiling and all the dishes came on different styled vintage plates. Service was very prompt as well!  FOOD: We weren't super hungry so the two of us shared a couple of apps! The korean fried chicken was my fav - lightly battered and super flavourful. The outside has a light crisp to it when you bite into each piece, and pairs well with the cauliflower being so juicy and soft. We also tried the smoked fish pate and charred broccoli salad. The pate was so light and creamy with a nice smokey flavour, and it was paired well with crisp flatbreads. The charred broccoli was also delicious - a little similar to the cauliflower but without the fried crispiness. There wasn't any lettuce in this dish so it's hard to think of it as a salad at all.   Overall, the food was delicious for a quick bite in the city. The only downside is the small menu and the price, but I'd definitely come back to try other dishes if they change up the menu every so often."}
{"text":"an amazing tiny restaurant  Offers comfort food  My favorite was the chicken pot pie and tuna melt. The portion was huge and i was so satisfied and full afterwards!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, service and food.  Pan seared trout on hummus was great, as were the fish tacos and Caesar salad.  A great find downtown, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Gabardine is always full and it's easy to see why. It's a small comfortable place with a menu of delicious comfort foods. The Caesar salad is served with a soft boiled egg and it is delicious! Burgers, Mac & cheese and other favourites make one of those hard to decide menus. Service is fast and the staff is friendly. A few more draft beer choices would help but I have no complaints. Cheerful vibrant crowd to make you feel better after a stressful Bay St day!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this place and I guess it's just not really my type of food.   Tried the Mac and cheese thing and the chicken pot pie. I usually don't even like Mac and cheese but I thought it tasted pretty alright and the way that my friend devoured it told me that it must have been delicious. The chicken pot pie was really good too.   Anyway, I was surprised at how the food that I normally didn't like was made so that I could eat it and enjoy it so kudos!"}
{"text":"Got the catfish sandwich which was my first time trying catfish, and I have to say, zero complaints! The fish was perfectly marinated and cooked, the fries came in abundance, and the ambience of the place was great! A bit costly for the size of the sandwich, but it was still a good experience. I did ask for recommendations from the server and she wasn't very helpful (maybe she was busy, but she didn't seem to want to engage) but I'm glad I chose what I did for my meal!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were supposed to meet for lunch and he suggested we meet at The Gabardine. He asked that we meet at 11:30am because it gets very busy by noon. I arrived at 11:25am and by 12pm the place was packed and there were several people waiting by the door to be seated.   As soon as my friend suggested that we meet her for lunch, I went on to Yelp to find out what dishes this place is known for. After reading several reviews, I decided that I wanted to order their burger. I am always searching for a good burger, so I was excited about the possibility that this would be the burger I have been looking for MY WHOLE LIFE! Can it surpass the #1 burger that currently owns my heart (this burger was eaten in Miami. Boo.. soooo far away!)?  In terms of the clientele, the place was packed with suits. 80% business men in suits with a sprinkle of women. I think I was the only one wearing casual clothing. Well, the staff and I.   We started off by ordering 2 teas at $3.50 a pop. When my friend requested honey for his tea, they offered him a bottle with dry honey in it. My friend tried to squeeze whatever life was still left in that little bottle, but he was only able to manage one drop or so. No honey?! The waiter seemed embarrassed, but no honey? Cross the street and buy some!  After some deliberation my friend decided to order the chicken pot pie for $18 and I ordered the burger, for also $18. I had read a lot about how puffy the crust is and I was so excited to see this \"puff.\" We got our food about 15 minutes later and the crust on his pot pie was flat as a pancake! How disappointing! My mood deflated and I am sure if you could visually see my mood, it would match the crust on this pot pie! Also, the pot pie did not come with a side. I have this weird habit of dipping my fries in the pot pies I eat, so not seeing fries on the side was odd to me. I know, this is not Swiss Chalet!  My burger was not as big as I expected it to be. Mind you, it was still a challenge to fit the whole thing in my mouth, but I managed (not a good sign since my mouth is not particularly big). My dish did come with fries and they were okay. I still prefer the fries from Le Select Bistro. I ate 75% of my burger until I called it quits. The burger came with cheese and bacon, and found the burger overall to be on the salty side. Funny since I felt that the fries needed more salt, and the burger needed another element to balance out the salt from the bacon and cheese. Did I think that this burger was a contender for best burger I ever had? No. The meat was juicy enough even though it was cooked well-done, and the bun was neither dry nor moist. But personally, I like my meat to be cooked medium to rare, and I like soft buns. Yes, I am being super picky here, but I really did have higher expectations for this restaurant. My friend did enjoy his chicken pot pie, though he did not finish it. I tried some of it, and it tasted good, but the filling was quite watery and fries would have absorbed the liquid quite well. ;)"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was the most memorable thing for my friend and I. Very good, but extremely heavy and creamy. Not calorie friendly at all. Our other friend had a BLT burger and she liked it.   Great servers and atmosphere. Would come back to unwind after work."}
{"text":"Last weekend while in Toronto, we were a bit early for the Nuit Blanche festivities, so we decided to go to The Gabardine for a drink.  I absolutely love this place, we had been here about a month prior and their drinks are fab.  We came without a reservation and we simply had our drink at the bar.  I ordered the ceasar and my sis had the kir royale, and both of the drinks were 10 dollars.  My drink had a lovely rim and the drink was SUPER spicy.  My only complaint is that use use fresh horseradish, and props to them, but the amount was too much.  I love horseradish, but there were moments where my mouth was on fire.  I think that they should ask you what your tolerance level is before concocting the drink.  My sis' drink was delicious, we have had champagne cocktails before but this was even simpler.  It was just champagne and cassis, it was simple, and perfect.  Overall this is such a great place to come to.  The service is genuine and the food and libations are outstanding."}
{"text":"Must try: Chicken Pot Pie  This is my go to place for Chicken Pot Pie as it's got one of the most legit pie crusts I have eaten to date. It's fluffy and herbed (such an awesome touch) and what I love the most is how it spills over the edge of the pot and forms this beautiful extension of extra crustiness. Oh.my.gosh. I'll stop here before it gets creepy.    I'm a little bit of a snobbish chicken pot pie aficionado and I don't understand why it's such a struggle to find a properly crusted pie. I don't want a tart cover or a potato cover or a film-of-sauce cover, thank you! Or if the crust is acceptable, then the filling is not creamy or cheesy enough, or it's too salty or it's missing one of the essential (simple) ingredients. And since Gabardine jumped over all these potholes, I'll come back time and again just for this dish.   Although not to be overly myopic, my companions have liked their food selections as well so I think everything is generally well done.   WYWH"}
{"text":"Trusting our handy guidebook, my boyfriend and I decided to hit up The Gabardine for dinner while visiting Toronto. The restaurant is small but has character. The ambiance gives off both a cozy and classy feel and the menu is diverse and reasonably priced for its location (or so I'm told).  I ordered a french martini off of the cocktail list, which was perfectly tasty. For dinner I couldn't resist ordering the sirloin bacon cheeseburger. The burger was delicious, well cooked, and came with a heaping portion of crispy french fries. My boyfriend ordered the sauteed black cod with braised lentils and mushrooms which was really great. I stole more than a few bites!  The Gabardine is a great place to visit for tourists and locals alike. The menu offers something for everyone and is a unique dinner choice in Toronto's financial district."}
{"text":"Tiny resto found in the Financial district of Toronto. Walked in for breakfast and opted for their granola, Greek yogurt topped with fruits with a side cappuccino.  Portion was actually quite huge which is good but perhaps a smaller portion available on the menu would be a nice to have. My breakfast was quite tasty and hit the spot. Couldn't finish it, too much.  Cappuccino was good but nothing to write home about.  Waiter was attentive and breakfast/coffee was served quickly. Location has a small intimate hipster vibe which is  a nice change compared to the majority of the restos nearby in this area of the city."}
{"text":"In an area like Parkdale, the Gabardine might have been just another artsy-updated-retro diner, but here in the downtown core, it's a down right hipster-inspired yet hipsterless (I'm obviously not counting the plaid-clad servers and chefs) haven. It is such a juxtaposition seeing the cinq-a-sept set chill out in this non-businessy hang out in their shirts and ties and designer handbags. Had there been a spot like this in the area back when I was still rocking the pinstripes and stilettos I might have been inclined to stay in the core for a few extra hours rather than brave the rush hour subway traffic with hunger pangs after a long day trapped in the cubicle.  The welcoming curved bar right up at the front can be a tempting place to park yourself, but the tables are more comfortable and the food is simply tasty. We chose to start with the devilled eggs and were pleased with the rich nostalgic flavour of them. My medium rare steak was just that and incredibly juicy. After all that and a bottle of wine, it was a small miracle that each of us still had room for dessert. Boy, were we glad that we did though! My sticky toffee pudding arrived looking like a giant meatball and was fantastic. A bite of the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich was also heavenly.  The service was incredibly pleasant from start to end. This is the type of no fuss place I'd be comfortable becoming a regular at if only my pocketbook would allow for such allowances."}
{"text":"Went tonight for my birthday dinner with some friends and it was hands down the best dinner I've had in a long time!  We ordered deep fried beer cheese, soft corn tortillas, mac and cheese, and the chicken pot pie. We shared everything amongst the three of us, and everything was delicious. All menu items ordered were absolutely delicious and service was quick and friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant.    I do suggest calling a few days in advance to make reservations as the restaurant is small and it took us two days to get a hold of someone, but it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Was visiting the area, and went with a friend who has been before. I had risotto, she had a salid. Both enjoyed a lot! Busy at lunch (we arrived at 1:30p and had a 10 min wait). Tables are close together. Not idea for intimate meal, but great for a casual lunch and catching up. Food is delicious, appropriately portioned, and well presented. Ended the meal with a decent cappuccino (7/10). Would definitely go back, and recommend."}
{"text":"Really like this downtown eatery.  There's nothing like it around that area.  Had a late dinner around 9pm on a week night and the place was still bustling.  We had the pull porked and the clubhouse sandwhiches.  Both were good although I favoured the pulled pork over the clubhouse. The sandwiches came with a small mixed green side salad.  We had originally wanted the burger but they were sold out.  They have $3 or $4 cans of PBR which is a bonus.  Skipped dessert but will get it next time around.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar for lunch. It's a cozy bar (no tv thank goodness) and ordered their roast chicken club sandwich, which came with a small salad and delicious potato salad. The chicken was very moist and so flavorful, I could have eaten another one!"}
{"text":"Good meal , great drinks and charming decor. We had the cauliflower for appetizer, and I had the chicken pot pie. Both was tasty and enjoyable. I had the tequila lemonade -really liked ."}
{"text":"Cosy place. Small intimate seatings. Friendly, hip and knowledgeable servers who knows how to create small talk to world politic affairs. I'm impressed!   First when I looked at the menu what seemed ordinary in the menu was just a list of comfort food. Nothing special, I thought. But wait till you get a taste of what was...ordered. I ordered a simple chicken pot pie. It was creamy, chicken was flavourful and best of all was the puff pastry. That was the right texture and consistency of the first bite.  We also tried one of the specials of the night- cod fish and steamed mussels with tomato base stew. The taste is just what you need for a cooling night. Darn right it hits the spot as a comfort food.   Greatly recommended. It gets busy during lunch and later at night. Weekends is almost impossible to get seats unless you make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"Today, my friend and I went here for a quick bite to eat. The service was decent. My friend grabbed the hot chicken pie and I the sirloin bacon cheeseburger. Both were decent. Good \"grub\". However, our major complaints are that the service wasn't up to par. When refilling our water, the server over poured. Water went all over the table and I left the restaurant with one shoe soaking wet. Before paying, I used the bathroom to wash my hands. It's down a hallway past the kitchen. As I was getting there, the servers seemed to be very gossipy about fellow diners and also about a select coworker that refuses to close up. We were highly unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Love it here! Great food, amazing cocktails, hot staff! Great breakfast (which is hard to find on Bay Street). The cheese selection, the pate, the doughnuts, the Mac and cheese and croque Monsieur are a few of my favorites."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot when I traveled to Toronto (March 2017). My boyfriend and I got there right when they ended their breakfast menu and started serving lunch, around 11am. It was empty but was filled up really quickly with  people in business attire. We were glad we beat the lunch rush for sitting down.  We ordered a chicken liver pate with apple butter and toast for appetizer. The portion was small (expected for what it is) but it was on par with the fruity jam.  For entree, we got mac n' cheese with breadcrumb crust and smoked ham ($2 more), and also chicken pot pie. We agreed we made the BEST choice. Both of the dishes were so delicious. For the mac n' cheese, those strings of cheese paired so well with the smoked ham. Everyone near us ordered mac n' cheese so it was clearly the winner. For the chicken pot pie, the filling was flavorful with a lot of ingredient."}
{"text":"Oh the mac-n-cheese! I added ham which was like Christmas dinner. My sister had the chicken potpie which was great too."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I tried the Korean fried cauliflower and the avocado ricotta toast.  The fried cauliflower was exactly what I expected and tasted exactly like Korean fried chicken with a nice crunchy and saucy \"skin.\"  Maybe a tad more batter than I like but pretty good.  The ricotta was a nice addition to the avocado toast, overall it was still light.  Considering it's avocado toast though, a little more avocado and a little less ricotta would've been nice, but it was decent (it's hard to screw up avocado toast)."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! This is what I have to say about this place. All the food here was simply amazing. We went there for lunch but it seems dinner is pretty similar.  - For appetizer we had deviled eggs - the filling was amazing and plentiful - The main dish as a fish that I can't really remember the name - it was the plate of the day. Impossible to describe how amazing it was. The skin was crispy and it included a mix of sauces that were out of this world - I was by then super full but couldn't leave a place like this without trying their dessert - once again went for the dessert of the day, a chocolate pie with fresh whipped cream on top - super crispy tart base and chocolate that tasted like a wonderful mousse  If there is one place I'll go back to eat when in Toronto is this place... no doubts"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. I made a reservation for a Friday night through the online form on The Gabardine's website, and they responded the next day to confirm my reservation. We arrived right on time, and after walking in we stood there awkwardly for quite some time before someone came over to greet us. We told the bartender we had reservations and it still took him a few minutes to figure out where we could sit. He looked really flustered. The greeting was not welcoming at all. He finally figured out to seat us at the one two-top that was clean... which was in plain sight when we walked in. After sitting there for quite some time, our server finally came over to take our drink order. Our server was really short, curt and super unfriendly. This didn't improve at all throughout our meal. She didn't check up on us or ask us if we wanted more drinks when they were running noticeably low. A server grabbed my plate while I was still working on my fries. The service was overall super unfriendly, and I felt like the servers didn't even want customers to be there. Ugh.   On to the food, which was marginally better than the service. To start we had the Korean Fried Cauliflower ($14). The cauliflower was nice and crisp, and the kitchen was generous with the delicious sweet/spicy sauce. This was pretty good, and the portion was fairly large. I had the bacon cheeseburger with fries ($20) as my entree and my husband had the chicken pot pie ($22). The cheeseburger was terrible. The bun was stale and looked like something that had been sitting out for several days at Rabba. Tomatoes were gross. There was so much sauce on the burger that I couldn't pick it up. The bottom bun was totally destroyed. It was super messy, there was way too much sauce, and the ingredients were poor quality. The fries were nice and crispy, with nice seasoning, but we had all of the bottom bits making it difficult to eat. I expected a lot more for $20. The chicken pot pie was better, but I don't think I would come back for it. The pastry was nice and flaky, and there were large chunks of chicken, but it was nothing special, just really rich and heavy.   The portions are large, but execution on the food is poor. We won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Gabardine. I'm an American that was visiting Toronto for a week and wanted to get a taste of what Canadian food really was. I'd say that the menu at the Gabardine wasn't very different than what I'd see at a nice American restaurant. The menu items and ingredients were very familiar so that was a little disappointing but if that's what Canadians eat then who am I to be upset. My favorite part about this place was their Gin cocktails. Try the chicken and waffles or the pot pie if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Mac and cheese with smoked ham and it didn't live up to the hype for me.  Portions were great and then people were good. Definitely a nice place to catch up and network."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of four on a Friday night with a reservation and really enjoyed our meal!  Limited beer and wine menu, but they had some great picks so no complaints.  I tried the signature burger which was delicioussss: juicy and not dry at all and super hearty with melty cheese all over it (drool). The fries were great too and super crispy and salty.  But even better than the burger was the chicken pot pie which my bf ordered. This was incredible and super hearty and creamy and the crust super buttery and homemade and fresh. Being lactose I would have likely died if I ordered it and ate the whole thing on my own (its HUGE) and the few bites I had were more than enough as it is really really rich. Even my bf who has no end to his appetite was stuffed after finishing it.   Also got the korean fried cauliflower to share. This was the best version of this dish I've had to far and even tastes better than fried chicken imo.  Our other two friends tried the fish tacos and the spicy fried chicken sandwich and both enjoyed their meals.  Total for two of us (burger and pot pie) and 4 beers came to $90 so not bad prices either. And love that they will take resos.   Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This Mac and Cheese was the most amazing mac and cheese in the history of my 27 years of life. This by no means an exaggeration. it is what my dreams are made of... and  everythign that is forbidden on my paleo diet....or anyother diet for that matter.  This was on the TorontoLife list of top 25 burger places. It held a loweley place at #16/25. So myself and my hubby met up for a Bay Street \"power lunch\" and the plan was to meet at 11:45/12:00pm and snag a table and try this delicious burger and mac and cheese that many yelpers rave about.   We arrived around 11:50. Result: PACKED. if your comign here for lunch get there by 11:30. And dont even bother coming after 12 because you will not get a table. Seriously. They dont take rezzo's an di saw so many people being turned away. We were told itd be a 30 minute wait. We were resilent. We stood in the back, grabbed 2 pints of delicious beer (beau's was yummy) and had a lovely conversation as we watched fellow diners devour their delicious looking meals plates on ....what else... china.   After 15 minutes, and not even 1/4 done my beer we were told a table was ready! Hallelujia! We sat and promptly ordered from our very friendly waitress. The lunch special sounded amazing by the way but we stayed the course...we had a task at hand.   Food came out within 15 minutes and my first impression was..omgod my thighs are going to expand and i may not be able to button these pants. The portions were MONSTRUOUS. The burger was HUGE. the fries were ABUNDANT and overflowing. the mac and cheese (no ham) was HUGE. The waitrer who brought our food out also was kind enough to bring it back to the kitchen to cut into 2 and plate for us seperately. Bonus points. I took a bit first. It was so hard to contain my excitement from what i was experiencing as my husband begged me to keep my emotions intact until he had a chance to taste it. he was too busy taking photos with his crappy iphone. (love you baby - not your phone).   Once he bit into it... he knew... just like i knew..that this was not a #16 burger. This was a runner up to the maple burger at e11ven. and damn close. The price point was excellent at 18.00 for the copious amounts of food you recieve. It wasnt anythign fancy but the meat quality was awesome, juicy, flavoruful. No crazy toppings to mask its delicious beefy flavour. The bun was sturdy but nothing special. Overall, a super enjoyable burger. The fries were just MEH. we played aroudn with them and poked at them but they were much interest to us. We had devoured the anteloupe...why would we bother chasing the fox?   The mac and cheese was a huge main size portion. Creamy oooey goooey cheese. Just strigns of cheese everywhere.a  feast for my eyes. and sooo tasty and decadent. The toppings were a lightly coated with breading...chrunchy... people, i licked this plate clean. No words. No words. So good. just eat it.  Will definately be back at this place for more lunches and to try soem more of their items...and definately for that burger. If your in the area... dont go to any of the other wasteland food options.... this is the real deal."}
{"text":"I was working really late one night and some friends wanted to meet here for a late dinner. I arrived a little after 8 and my friends were already there but it was pretty packed for a random Tuesday night. I wasn't expecting this so make sure to make a reservation! We started off with drinks at the bar and just ended up staying there since the restaurant was so full. We all ordered something different and the waitress recommended the mac and cheese, chicken pot pie. Personally, I felt everything was too rich for my taste and the portions were pretty big so none of us were able to finish our food. Everything on the menu was comfort food so make sure that's what you're looking for before you come here! Overall, I thought the first two bites of everything here was pretty good but after that the food is just too rich."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here for dinner on a Friday night and made a reservation and it took the staff 15 minutes to get our table ready. Stupid. I ordered the chicken liver pate and chicken pot pie, both were really good and I finished by myself. The chicken pot pie came out piping hot and there were huge chunks of chicken and the puff pastry was sooo delishhhh. My friend ordered the mac and cheese with smoked ham, which was amaaazing, super cheesy, rich and tasty. We all left extremely full with food babies popping out of our stomachs. Although we all thoroughly enjoyed dinner, everything on the menu is a little too rich/heavy so probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were on a Canadian family vacation and just left The Hockey Hall of Fame. We were wandering around the neighborhood looking where to eat, checking Yelp reviews as we went along. This place had great reviews and they were most accurate. I wish it was in my neighborhood.  Nice atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food. Walk here after the HHoF and have a great meal and a cocktail...or two"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to have lunch here today. They don't accept reservations for lunch so you'll need to be here by 11:45am to guarantee yourself a seat. In that respect, I am not a big fan as I prefer to have a later lunch 12:30 to 1:00ish, however, you won't get a seat at those times unless you wait a little bit.   Is it worth the wait? - yes most definitely. The food is extremely fresh and cooked to perfection. I had the cheddar bacon burger and it was amazing. One of the best hamburgers I have had around the city. The fries were really great as well.   Service staff were so friendly and attentive, so would highly recommend this to anyone who wants good quality food in a nice environment."}
{"text":"This place has some really great reviews, but my experience here was not very impressionable, 3.5. I came here on a Tuesday night with one other person, without a reservation. When we arrived around 7:20, the place was completely packed and we had to wait a while to get a table (maybe around 20-30 mins?), so I would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand. Eventually we got a table because the people who reserved didn't show up. The place is not that big, and is dimly lit. I guess it could be considered a good place for a date, since we saw quite a number of couples there, but in some areas of the restaurant the tables are pretty close together (i.e. ours and the pair beside us), so that kind of makes it difficult to have an intimate conversation. I do like the decor though - lots of wood, kind of a rustic feel.  I ordered the mac and cheese with smoked ham, and my dinner partner ordered a burger. I thought the mac and cheese was pretty good, but super super heavy and filling. I had a really difficult time with it and only ended up finishing 2/3 of it. Although I enjoyed it, it didn't really blow me away though, and after about halfway through I got kind of bored of just the cheesiness and the salty flavour from the ham. Not bad on the restaurant's part, but maybe I'm just not a mac and cheese person. I didn't try any of the burger, but my date said it was really good, as in on his Top 5 list of best burgers in Toronto. So while I can't attest to anything, i would say that's a good review, considering he's tried burgers from a lot of different places. He did mention that it was pretty oily though, but I suppose that's what made it so good.  I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here and trying something else, but I don't really have any particular inclination to either. Service though was great, the waiter serving us seemed genuinely nice and did a good job."}
{"text":"Would love to review the food. Unfortunately you can't eat here even with a reservation. Their system knows how to take reservations but doesn't know how to hold or recognize them. Big waste of time. And the snobby front of house service was completely obnoxious as they refused to recognize their mistake and fix it. Don't waste your time or money here. Too many better places."}
{"text":"Great food, Great atmosphere, what else can I say? Even my buddie Hao agrees"}
{"text":"Very obnoxious female hostess/manager speaks about me within earshot old me and enforces an obnoxious rule that you can't order from the bar menu to go"}
{"text":"The Gabardine is a hep lil' spot that seems more befitting of West Queen West than Financial District. Its washwashed brick walls covered with mismatched frames and old newspapers, white tin-ceiling, old-timey lightbulbs, newspaper clippings and well-bearded staff scream hipster more than pinstripes. It's like they took a well-heeled core cafe and \"put a bird on it.\" Metaphorically speaking.  Their kitchen closes at 10pm, which only is a few minutes after I get up, so after a few false starts, I finally managed to grab a seat here. Their mostly-local menu features \"snacks\" (a collection of under $10 nibbles), salads, sandwiches, and their large plates (which range from $14 - 23). You can grab the Ploughman's Lunch which fancy-talk for a sharing platter. They also have a respectable array of desserts and old fashioned cocktails.  I picked the rabbit rillette with brioche. It was nice, not too salty, and a fair-sized portion for $9. I also snagged an Old Fashioned and a Negroni. The old fashioned was a bit sweet for my liking, but that's not really much of a complaint. Drinks are $7-10, and a premium martini will set you back $13, and they have a pretty long wine list too.  Definitely a welcome addition to the core. I'd like to come back and try more drinks and maybe a few more drinks after that. Closed on weekends.  Obligatory Title Pun: The gift of GABardine.  Menu Readability: Centred aligned and beautiful.  Need to mention: Closed on weekends.  What this place teaches me about myself: I need to get up earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Great spot. The food is fantastic and th service is spot on. All of the waiters and bartenders were very kind and accommodating. The food was fab-tacos were killer! Will be back."}
{"text":"Good food feelingly place and staff. Had cajun cat fish sandwich and fries. 17$ Husband had the mussels 28$ Glass of cab 15$ And the apple upwind down cake was excellent and a good finish touch 10$. With tx and tip close to 100$ diner. A bit pricy but it goes with the neighborhood being in the financial district."}
{"text":"I am happy to give an overall A based on single visit.  Nice variety of high quality and tasty food and drink options, good and friendly service, simple but nice ambiance.  Not fancy or pretentious.  Not intimate or quiet seating. Not a scenic view or even a good view of not the best foot traffic outside for people watching, but that is not really to be expected downtown."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at The Gabardine this weekend. I went to grab a light lunch with a friend and ordered the soup of the day, Cauliflower Purée, and a starter, Chicken Liver Pâté with Apple Butter, Sprouts and Toast. The flavours were excellent and creative and portion sizes were perfect. I have no complaints whatsoever! Definitely coming back for a second round of tasting."}
{"text":"I can here for lunch with a couple of other coworkers. It's quite busy at lunch so I recommend going around their opening time at 11:30am to ensure you get a good spot.  They are quite protective of their own branding and will pour any outside coffee (I.e. Starbucks) into a glass cup.  Service time was average for a financial district restaurant. I ordered the haddock sandwich and it was delicious. The haddock was nicely fried. The salad was probably the highlight with a mix of greens and a very tasty dressing.  The place has a good variety of foods as my vegetarian friends got risotto (daily special) and a Mac and cheese. It may be a bit heavy but was quite tasty too."}
{"text":"my review is based on 3 visits to The Gabardine. thsi is really closer to a 4.5 star place in my opinion.   The food here is fantastic, the mac and cheese is a real winner here. It's creamy and garlicy and piping hot. the sauce is flavourful, wasn't clumpy or broken, the crust is great and it's beautifully put together. The fish pie is great, very favourful, and just great comfort food on a cold day. the chicken pot pie is deliciously creamy and full of moist chicken under a flakey buttery crust.  Also, the drinks here are strong and well balanced, and the caeser is not diluted down with ice.   the service is great for the most part; friendly staff who aren't pretentious. it was a bit inconsistent though, i feel like the dinner service has much better waitstaff. the lunch waiters were ok, but it was a bit hard to flag someone down at times. the place fills up fast and there was a line up the 2/3 times that i went. The resto has an ossington feel to it, not your typical downtown restaurant, i certainly did not expect the interior to be as comfortable and intimate as it was. i will certainly keep coming back here.  what keeps it from being a 5 star is it's probably not good for larger parties; for a table of 2, the tables are a bit close together; and the inconsistent service. otherwise, it's a very good place."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  This little gem for the financial district is well worth your visit. It's packed full of tables and a little noisy, but the decor is fab and wow the food is fantastic!   We had the rabbit rillettes and the chicken pate, which were both phenomenal (including their sauces, although the little bits of bread croutons were nothing special). The mac n cheese was perfect, albeit very rich and could be shared. The chicken pot pie had a beautiful crust and was full of flavour, although again very rich and worth sharing with a salad.   We will definitely be back, especially for quick after work meals."}
{"text":"Food = Awesome Service = Awesome  We had the beer battered fried cheese croquettes, the mac and cheese, the philly cheesesteak, and the lemon cardamom doughnuts. This place is fabulous. I wish I lived nearby.  Yet another gem buried in the crap pile that is Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a great afternoon to evening at The Gabardine recently. Prompted by an article praising their mac and cheese, both I and my dining companion ordered this and we were not disappointed. It is amazing and would be worth a return visit... but there are so many good looking entrees! The deep fried beer cheese croquettes were also delicious. We were there so long, we needed an order of fries and they were tasty too.  Great service: friendly, accommodating and knowledgable. Liked the decor too."}
{"text":"Gabardine was the perfect spot after a long day on the road (From North New Jersey with a stop at the falls in Buffalo then into TO). Relaxing atmosphere with not a worry about dress code. We sat at the bar in the tall seats which were very comfortable. You can tell a place that cares about it's food from the demeanor of the service to the choice of beers all chalked up on a board with the food specials. The care that the waiter made to make my wife's cocktail ensured that we would be in a for a great meal. I started with the smoked trout which was laid out on a bed of luscious salad (cabbage, carrots and greens). The dressing was citron and a beautifully subtle accompaniment to the fish. Zero bones - couldn't find one!!. Great start. My kids and wife had the burger and panino - the burger came highly rated and used home made sirloin - very tasty! I chose the beet risotto and it was delicious - I'm a bit of a beet freak and coupled with the risotto it made a great combination - lord knows where you come up with that pairing but it worked really well. A couple of local beers and some delicious espresso to finish up the night made for a great experience. I wish we lived closer as I would love to work my way through their menu - lucky Torontoans!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow fish pie. How could I resist such a unique item. Honestly, I could tell the quality was quite high, but it wasn't my thing. Luckily, I like their ploughman's lunch.. It's amazing.  The distinct allure of this place also caught my attention part of it being on bay street."}
{"text":"I finally made my way to The Gaberdine (@thegabardine) last month since I was craving for some indulgent comfort food. It's not a typical restaurant you'll expect to find in the Financial district and it also just so happen to be within 3-5 mins walking distant from Eaton Centre which is perfect for a shopaholic like me (^_^)  We arrived there at around 8:30pm on a Friday night and still manage to get a table without reservation (lucky us). I have only manage to snap one picture of the interior since the waitress advice me not to but feel free to take picture of the food.   Fielding Estate Winery 2011Rock File Pinot Gris ~ As usual we love supporting local and not only was it tasty but super affordable. I made a mental note to visit this winery one day :)  Ploughman's Lunch $19 ~ We decided to share this and although it's not the fest terrine/pate I had, it was pretty good and I especially enjoy their pairing of the jelly/compote and fruits  Mac and Cheese w/ breadcrumb crust $16 (w/ Smoked Ham $18) ~ This is probably their most popular dish, so we couldn't resist since we were craving for some comfort food after all and this is the ultimate comfort food. ~ I personally thought that the ham was necessary but apparently the bf thought differently, so he ended up eating most of the ham :) ~ I don't know about you but I love picking on the side for the crispy/burn cheese  ~ Rich creamy deliciousness  Crispy Sweetbread w/ Garlic Scapes, Black Bean Sauce  ~ I totally forgot to ask about the special and then saw this on tweeted feed, seeing the sweetbread we just have to order it.  ~ The sweetbread was really delicious but I though the back bean sauce was way too salty and overpowering    Deep Fried Black Currant Toutons w/ Maple Caramel, Devon Cream & Black Current Jelly $9 ~ This was served piping hot, perfect contrast with the cold cream and the tart jelly balance out the sweetness brilliantly.  ~ This was my first time having toutons which is basically frying bread dough, it was slightly more chewy taht I expected.   Verdict : ~ Very friendly and attentive service. ~ Great food and very affordable wine list  ~ Love teh laid back atmosphere to enjoy some comfort food without breaking the bank. ~ I will definetly go back"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about The Gabardine that I couldn't be more excited to finally try it out for myself. My friends and I met up for a Friday lunch. We arrived promptly before 11:30 so we luckily were able to snatch a table for 7, quite a difficult feat for such a small restaurant. The place soon filled up within 10 minutes of opening for lunch service and remained extremely busy throughout our meal. Note that The Gabardine does not take reservations for lunch.   One of us had the fish pie ($20) with with clams, mussels, haddock,smoked trout, mashed potato and buttermilk biscuit. The \"pie\" turned out to be more like a seafood chowder. I tried a spoonful and it was luxuriously rich and creamy, maybe a little too heavy for lunch.   A friend and I shared a shrimp po'boy ($15) with butter lettuce, tomato relish and aioli. I was so glad we settled on ordering this as it turned out to be my favourite dish on the table! What really stood out was the sweet tomato relish, which packed a punch of flavour. It was a difficult to contain everything in the sandwich - the delicately fried shrimp, in particular - into one bite, but the resulting combination was absolutely delicious!   Two of my friends shared the sirloin bacon cheeseburger ($18), which they both reported to be too salty. We also couldn't finish that mountain of fries, despite our best efforts.   And lo and behold... some of us ordered Gabardine's famous mac and cheese. We tried the version with smoked ham ($18). To me, mac and cheese is the epitome of comfort food, and I've heard nothing but praise for the Gabardine's version. I have to say that it was superbly cheesy. Perhaps I didn't love cheese as much as I thought I did, but I found it all a bit overwhelming after a short while. I also wanted more of that breadcrumb crust, but maybe that was obscured by the smoked ham. I would be happy to share this with a table of 4, but eating its entirety would be too indulgent.   I really wanted to try dessert here, but after chowing down my po'boy and mooching off too much of that mac and cheese, my stomach had absolutely no room to spare. Overall, I enjoyed my sandwich immensely, but the mac and cheese didn't exactly live up to my expectations. That said, I'd definitely want to come back for dinner to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe in this hip gastro pub. The food is a little heavy for my taste, but the beers are excellent and the atmosphere transports you far away from the financial district that surrounds."}
{"text":"Updating review, almost exactly one year later -  service and food still fantastic! asked server if they had any Korean fried chicken wings left over from the other day (saw on Facebook that this was their special the night before), she said unfortunately not but lo and behold a box of it shows up on our table, free of charge!   I'd eat here everyday if it was in my budget."}
{"text":"Very good baked Mac and Cheese and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner and had the fish tacos and chicken pot pie. The fish tacos were really good. I wish I was given more! However, I did not like the side salad. It had too much dressing for my taste. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her pot pie and wasn't able to finish it because the portion was so big.   I had seen a review online for a burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich and was really looking forward to having that for dessert. Unfortunately, that's not on the menu anymore =(."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I heard good things about the Gabardine and I was excited to go. My girlfriend and I came on our anniversary and started with their cocktails, which were really nice. Very inventive drinks with good flavours.  The place is small and intimate but with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff is friendly and attentive and our waitress recommended some dishes, her top being the skirt steak. Now I've made some skirt steaks in my day and I think it's a nice cut of meat but since it was one of the most expensive items on the menu at $30, I had high expectations. I wasn't impressed with it. I asked for it medium rare but it was a little more on the rare side which didn't bother me but as I made my way through I found the steak was kind of cold. I also thought it didn't have much flavour even though it came with an au jus type sauce and some fries which were well seasoned. The cut of meat just tasted cheap and it was a little tough. It came garnished with bacon which was over cooked. I eventually asked them to heat it up a little (I had eaten half of it by the time I got to the middle and realized it wasn't warm enough). When it came back it was only slightly warmer but on a new plate with practically none of the sauce, which made the meal even more disappointing.  My girlfriend had the mac and cheese, which was quite good if you don't mind a rich dish. Overall, I might go back to try something new as I heard good things about the chicken pot pie but my experience has been kind of soured. I really wanted to like this place but maybe I went on an off night. Our waitress saw that I wasn't that into the meal and she offered to buy us dessert, which kind of insinuated that she would go out of pocket instead of it being on the house, so we politely declined. It was a nice gesture but it wasn't her fault my steak wasn't good. Nonetheless, give one of the other dishes a try, you might have better luck than me."}

{"text":"Saw that the Westin Harbor Castle wanted $22 for a clubhouse, so decided to grab an Uber and see what else I could find in the financial district.    This place is very cozy, with great - and quick - service.  Full of people clearly on break from towers in the area, but no big groups creating noise the day we were there.   The clubhouse sandwiches ordered by the table next to us looked absolutely delicious, and were massive.  Huge chunks of turkey breast.  Definitely wish I had ordered that instead of the grilled cheese, which they do on a sweet dark rye bread.    Beware of menus you find online - the one I found, which I think was linked by Yelp - was out of date.  The Tuna Melt is no longer available!!"}
{"text":"This place can be a lil hard to find lately cuz of all the scaffolding up around this area. It's just around the corner from where I work, so I chose this as a bday dinner spot. Made reservations the day of and got seated right away when we showed up. It's busy, loud, and tables are pretty close together. This isn't the place for a nice quiet dinner.  I had to order the daily risotto because, for some reason, somewhat mushy rice appeals to me. It's always a veggie risotto and today it happened to be some spicy corn  risotto.It was done really well, the rice wasn't overcooked and it was just spicy enough to make my mouth tingle.   The other dish we ordered was the shrimp po'boy, based on recs. Not sure what to expect, but this didn't really live up to how good I thought it would be. I love shrimp and I love breaded shrimp, but when you put it in a sandwich with sauce and toppings, the breading turns into a soggy mess. Maybe I need to eat it faster next time, I dunno.  Ended the night with the famed burnt marshmallow sandwich, which was every good as I imagined it to be. I love the choco cookie they used to sandwich the marshmallow ice cream.   Drinks were reasonable. I got a Bourbon Old Fashioned and it was good enough to last me the dinner with a buzz. Great night."}
