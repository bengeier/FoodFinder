{"text":"Well we went with another couple to have a nice dinner for the first time there,. We found the place tiny and tables very close  together.  Uncomfortably so. The menu looked good.  Now the not so good part.  The waiter and we believe he was also the owner was so very rude to our guests.  We were all taken aback.  Never have we been treated with such arrogance and disrespect.  Our lovely female of our couple was just mentioning something about a dish we were going to order and he said if you'll stop talking I'll finish the special!  It was was jaw dropping rude! Our friends are The sweetest people well traveled and polite.  We're all late 50 to 60.  Dressed nicely.   I think the food was ok as that really put a huge damper on our happy mood. . I felt so badly for our friends.    We will never ever go back.  I wish we would have said something to his rudeness but with people packed in around us and this arrogant man catching us all off guard we had no chance to stand up for this lovely lady who was embarrassed by this total jerk. People That arrogant and rude would have justified his his terrible behavior and made a worse scene in front of his captive audience anyway. He definitely thought very highly of himself and his loud voice.    This is a true review. Happened about a year and a half ago now and before I ever knew about yelp. Negative stars for this owner aka very ignorant man.  Can't believe he's still in business. .unless he adjusted his arrogant attitude and Nasty mouth."}
{"text":"Very good! Phil's great too ( the cook/owner) pizza, soup, three course meals and carpaccio are all my favorites, I'd recommend extreme to anyone. Plus its so close to home. Make reservations though its a small place! You could order to take out too"}
{"text":"My friends parents hired them to cater a party for a wedding it was a complete disappointment in every regard . If your function is a once in a lifetime affair don't trust them . The food that was provided  was extremely lackluster and I have a very hard time believing a executive chef prepared the food. Sandwiches were provided with very good buns but the only meats given was extremely dry and overcooked turkey  and what seemed like store bought precooked ham. No cheese was even provided . The whole thing seemed like they were trying to feed a crowd as cheaply as possible . Why no normal cold cuts why no cheese . My my friend told me what he had to pay for the food I was shocked , I've had better meals made for me in a pti camp on a drilling rig  and that says a lot . It seems it was his mother that picked the company and the groom is not currently happy with his mother . /shrug maybe it was just a bad night or maybe they forgot some trays or something .  But really what kind of chef overcooks a turkey , hasn't he ever heard of brining. Tempted to try the restaurant but then again why bother . Sorry if this seems overly critical but honestly not one person there had anything good to say about the food.  Maybe it was a bad night but more care and effort is needed for a important function like a wedding .  Found out at a later date that several trays of food was missing so a minor discount was given but once again if it's a once in a life time event do you want to risk it ? Added one star"}

{"text":"I've driven by here hundreds of times but didn't realize there was a restaurant here. It's  kind of tucked away and has some strange neighbours and if you manage to catch the sign it doesn't really do much to describe what you're in for.   This is NOT a hole in the wall kind of place like you might expect.  It's actually in the higher end for food when considering other places around it.   With that is mind the prices are reasonable for what you can expect.   The decor is nice inside and a surprise from the curb appeal.  The whole place was very cold in the winter and I put my coat on a couple times after someone entered or left.   The service was very slow (I think only 1 in the kitchen, 1 on dishes and 1 on service that night) but even still there was only 1 other table at any given time.    The food is obviously a classically trained chef made type food. It's too small to have much of a staff so I think the chef actually made it himself which is fairly rare.   He also popped into the front of house a couple times to talk people who were eating their mains.  We ordered carpaccio which was a little different than expected.  It was served warmish because it was seared in a fairly thick portion of meat.  Our expectations were VERY thin cuts that were cold and raw.  This was mostly like a thin raw steak but  decent.    Also got the brushetta but I wasn't tickled by the olives that were featured in it but it was fresh and otherwise quite good and I was surprised by the portion of it being larger than expected.  For the main we had Vegetable Bean Rice Chili which was amazing and stayed amazing the next day when I had my leftovers at work while my coworkers wished they had some too.   I've been to southern USA and had some of the authentic foods down there and this was better than anything I've had there.   The Linguini DeMilo my finance got was boring boring boring.  It lacked any taste (even of garlic).  I was quite sad by this because it's only 1 of 2 veggie dishes and I would never order it again.   Desserts were not the best here.   I think we had lemon cake (a bit old tasting even if it wasn't) and brownie sundae (the brownies were waxy with little chocolate taste).  I don't think i'd do these again unless we went with a 3 course menu which includes it.  I will be back and I think the 3 course menu looks like a great deal (but nothing veggie for me) but it's something to watch for on sundays or early weeknight evening for sure."}
{"text":"Small location tucked away inside a small strip of shops.  We heard the place gets busy so we arrived early for lunch.  The place is elegantly decorated which contrasts with the exterior.  There were maybe 10 tables with only two being used so I was thinking it was a slow day.  The waitress/hostess asked if we had a reservation - we didn't.  She seated us at a table and said make sure to make a reservation next time as this was the only spot.   Food is comfort style with everything from omelettes to stew with a small but good selection of dishes that includes chicken, beef, pork, and seafood.  Lots of stuff with mashed potatoes and veggies.      I had the schnitzel which I thought was good and the mashed potatoes were tasty.  The veggies were some overdone scoop of something.  It came with a house salad and I wasn't asked what kind of dressing I wanted.  The salad was similar to the kind you find in a chain place that comes out of the bucket.  My friend had the omelette which was pretty runny in the middle and she hates runny eggs.    The deal breaker for me was when I went to pay.  The waitress did some stuff with the cash register and then said what kind of cookie do you want.  She then proceeded to reach into a large basket of meringue cookies with her unwashed hands and put a couple on a plate.  I was going to suggest some tongs but it was past the point.   Just as we were leaving, another couple walked in and the waitress told them there were no tables unless they wanted to sit at the unclean table we just vacated.  There were still 5 empty clean tables."}
{"text":"Been here four times now: thrice for lunch and once for dinner. Small but charming space, food is delicious, service superb. A mostly European menu, and don't overlook the desserts (creme brulee, chocolate mousse, pecan tart, etc.). It only seats 28, so best to make reservations."}
{"text":"Chefs special 25 bucks...... Super. We ordered from the menu anyway, great service and quiet on a Friday night . Out of the way location but worth The trip. all the appetizers and meals were great, nice touch being able to get a half a desert so we all tried something . Very tasty and good menu.  Little over 200 bucks for four with, two bottles of wine great value AND FOOD"}
