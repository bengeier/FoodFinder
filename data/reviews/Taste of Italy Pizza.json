{"text":"I love this place I'm from New York and I can tell u these guys know how to cook from the pizza to the pasta salad subs whatever you think of is absolutely delicious this is real food as I always say family Buisness are more appreciated in doing there craft then big restaurants everything homemade from the sauce to the doe this place is absolutely perfect a taste of Italy in the beautiful desert can't go wrong with that and to you \"taste of Italy\" cheers :)"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. It is family owned and operated and the service and food is exceptional. I've been going here many years and have never been disappointed. They make everything fresh and everything tastes amazing. Customer for life. Frank makes a custom item for me called the Eggplant Rollatini stuffed with red peppers and penne Vodka sauce. I love it!"}
{"text":"This is pretty good pizza and I believe the same owner has the other 1 a little further down estrella and there pizza is definitely better I drive a little bit further  to get their pizza"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service.  If you are looking for fantastic pizza, go no further.  This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Pizza is top notch! Friendly people, cute place. Penne Vodka to die for!  I'm from a predominantly Italian area in New England and this pizza is the real deal. Their homemade dressings are yummy too. Love the staff!  Eggplant parm is always on point. Couldn't ask for a better neighborhood pizza place!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff.   This is the second time and probably the last time that I visit.   Each time the cashier messed up on my order and the food cost much more that I anticipated.  Today for example I ordered the eggplant hero sandwich but received an was charged for the full eggplant parmesan dinner.   Previously ordered a delivery pizza when the pizza arrived the delivery man wanted my credited number an was going to write it on a 3x5 card!  I had to call and inform the cashier that was inappropriate.   The food is okay but too pricey.  Cashier needs more training."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Food has gone downhill a bit. It's the only thing up here aside from fast food so they get away w things. Something simple like spaghetti and sausage, mostly noodles w a splash of sauce. Is the sauce really so costly u only put tablespoon per order?"}
{"text":"The cooks are amazing when I eat there and the delivery is the quickest I've ever seen!  They always keep it nice and clean. Everyone has great hospitality and the counter girls are always the nicest. The owner really knows how to make you feel apart of the family even for a moment. I suggest this restaurant to anyone. Great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Always a good experience here.  The antipasti was great, plenty for 4 of us to share.  We ordered the Eggplant topping pizza, medium size.  Again generous portions.  Would have been enough to feed us alone.  Also ordered cheese calzone.  Food was all great, fresh and hot.  Took boxes home for what we couldn't finish.  Friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere, casual, clean, family friendly.  Enjoyed dining outside on the patio this time, great surroundings.  Have also enjoyed the Taste of Italy location in Goodyear.  Recommend both but this one is tops for having out-of-the-way elegant setting along with consistenly great food."}
{"text":"Great authentic food with great service! Greasy deliciousness. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Chicago and was nervous I would never find good Italian food or pizza like we had back home. I was blown away by Grandma's Sicilian pizza - you must get it! Their pasta with red clam sauce is to die for! I'm so happy this place is just minutes from my house. What a gem!"}
{"text":"I live in California and everytime I come to AZ I make sure to stop by Taste of Italy. The food and service is awesome and the manager Frank always makes sure you're taken care of. Highly recommend this place if you are ever in Goodyear!!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the pizza because it's all I get here, but it's fantastic.  The Taste of Italy is a work of art.  Crispy, slightly chewy crust, delicious toppings.  Just awesome."}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza. Nice place to have in the neighborhood. We arrived late one night for pizza and wine. The guy at the counter happily served us and insisted we dine in anyway."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Always happy with the service and the food. :) Favorite: Spaghetti & Meatballs. Simple - Yummy."}
{"text":"Order the Taste of Italy Special pizza.  It is awesome!  We love this place and it is close to us. I was expecting to drive for miles for a decent pizza. This place rocks!!!  Great employees and a happy place for dinner or take out!"}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to get an order correct?  I can't wait till the new pizza place opens at Starpointe.   Last week the girl taking my delivery order over the phone was obviously very new and not trained.  She didn't know the menu at all when we tried to order. Even after asking someone else there several times during the call, our order was still not correct.  Last night our delivery had 2 mistakes. One item was completely wrong and not even close to what we ordered and then we got the wrong salad dressing.  It's also funny how every delivery order will take 45 mins, yet it will actually arrive between 20 mins and an hour later. Guess the training program at this place doesn't really exist, but as others have said, when you're the only place around I guess you can do what you want.  If the food wasn't so good, I would never go back."}
{"text":"We order monthly from here and it's always very good..quality has dropped a tad but overall we liv the quality ofv their food. Only order wrong few times in 3yrs do thts good, lasagna great,  pizza good, jalapenos n anyltipasta salad my fav..Ranch dressing the bomb!!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that this place is nothing special.  There are some tables available if you would like to dine in, but for the most part people call in for takeout.  The pizza and sandwiches are decent, but not out of this world amazing.  I would steer clear of the pasta dishes.  They just aren't very good.  Edible, but very disappointing.  This place is overall not a bad option if you are looking to bring something home for dinner after work.  However, don't expect to be blown away by deliciousness."}
{"text":"Pizza is really average might as well get papa johns across the street for the price"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and often incredible wings. The reason for that 'often' is the same reason for my 4-star rating instead of 5. Unfortunately, Taste seems to be quite indecisive in its barbecue wings--often, the wings are nothing short of magical, probably the best wings I have ever had at a restaurant. However, they will occasionally completely switch the wing sauce for a few days to what is typically a far inferior sauce. I don't know whether they are experimenting or not, but I do wish the wings would remain the same as they usually are--I'd rather not play Russian roulette when I'm hoping for their typically wonderful wings."}
{"text":"Great Thin crust pizza. Very consistent . Not impressed with the little baby wings they offer however. WHERES THE MEAT? also need more flavor variety. I'd say go with the pizza but for sure get your wings elsewhere. Also I've never dined in so I'd like to try that sometime. We shall see."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Very friendly staff, franky is a great guy. It's got that local feel to it and the owner does his part in the kitchen. What they may lack in professionalism they more than make up for in authenticity. I bring my friends to this place when they visit because it's always a unique and new experience. The staff is great, the food is good and the atmosphere is always improving. Franky has definitely made some awesome changes since the last owners left. I'd definitely recommend giving them a shot if you want good food or cool people to talk to!"}
{"text":"This is the the tastiest New York pizza I have ever had! You must try the Stromboli it is very good but a little greasy. I also really enjoy their pizza and wings combo... The wings are surprisingly very good for a New York style pizza place.  There is a good beer special when you eat in.  Excellent and would put up against any New York style pizza in the valley. The owners are straight out of New York and it has a Bronx Tale feel to it. Fuggedaboutit!Mangia!"}
{"text":"We used to LOVE Taste of Italy as our go to place for good quality, consistent Pizza & Italian food .We usually pick up our orders but tonight I asked for delivery since I just got out of the hospital after having knee surgery and half of the topping was off off the pizza when it was delivered. Check out the photo. We have frequented the restaurant at least once a month for the last 3 1/2 years but no more as it's been all down hill for the last six+ months."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with the food here.  We've tried almost everything on the menu.  Our regular picks usually end up being pizza and wings, but when we have guests over, we mix things up with a variety of salads and pastas.  Staff is friendly enough given how busy it can get at times."}
{"text":"If you crave pizza slices of authentic Italy street food, this satisfies!  They make thin crust \"New York style\" pies -- a great little place to have in my neighboorhood, a local favorite with fast and friendly staff.   Granted I prefer thick \"Chicago style\" with way more toppings, and their versions of Greek or Ceasar salads are tailored to Americans (i.e., iceberg lettuce), other than that quite tasty."}
{"text":"Recently tried this restaurant. We had take out pizza and wings. They're we were excellent. Had family over for the holiday and ordered their pizza and wins special. Again the food was excellent. This will be our go to place for pizza from now on. The owner and staff are friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I always thought most pizza was the same. Ok, not great, but ok. Then I finally tasted pizza that blew my mind! They must use fresh ingredients cuz it's the first time I've been blown away by the flavor of a slice of pizza! I won't eat any other brand anymore. Taste of Italy ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, salads and wings. It is nice having it close by when we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I love having this place up in Estrella. I am not a fan of PJ across the street and don't want to go far for a pizza. This place has great pizza and more. I like the fett. Alfredo and it was good but needed a little more alfredo IMO. I do wish this place was more of a sit down for service kinda place rather than go up to a counter to order place but I am thrilled to have this as a place to eat up here in Estrella!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food, service! Visiting sister on the hill so it was nice to find this joint close by, other places are fast food!"}
{"text":"We tried this place as it is the only restaurant near our home where you can sit down to eat.  The servings are large but not edible and expensive.  Service did not exist - just young kids who don't care.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a Calzone Special. It has mushrooms, peppers, pepperoni, sausage and cheese. Hope I didn't leave anything out. It was really good! I live in Peoria so I probably won't be back for that reason, but if I was close by I'd definitely stop in to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I love the strombolis here they are delicious. The pasta is also very good. The pizza is ok, sort of average for my liking but i've only tried the meat lovers. This is a family owned local business and that says a lot since there aren't many local places on the west valley.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, reasonable prices, and free delivery! Will definitely order from again."}
{"text":"Nice place to gather, have a beverage and a bite to eat. Calzones are pretty good, pizza is average. The plus for us is location and ability to take the family."}
{"text":"Not the greatest, but in Estrella there isn't that much to choose from. The pizza is acceptable as are their other offerings. If it's quick food you want, this is my best choice. Ted S"}
{"text":"Always great service and  food! I didn't even like wings until I tried theirs!  Definitely  the best around - pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"Omg! Too much food. They have a great family friendly atmosphere and their food is good. I could've made 10 meals out of my order. This is a plus for most people"}
{"text":"It's a rare restaurant that can actually make the food they serve look exactly like the glossy pictures on their menus. And to top it off, it's the best Italian food I've eaten in years! Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is pretty decent NY-style (though the name says Italy) pizza serving the residents of Estrella Mountain Ranch. The other option is Papa Johns, so... In all seriousness though, the food is good, and the place is nice and clean inside. They offer fair lunch combos, and the wings (which I've tried previously) aren't half-bad either. If your anywhere near EMR, A Taste of Italy is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Staff is very attentive and caters to locals which is good for me, a local. Pizza is flavorful and fresh, beer is cheap and the environment is inviting. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Good, but I enjoy the one down the hill a little better. Smaller, more at home feeling at the other location. Food tastes the same."}
{"text":"I expected to find great pizza when we visited New York, but Arizona? Ironically, we had better pizza in Arizona than in New York, thanks in large part to Taste of Italy Numero Dos. Our friends live two blocks away and are enthusiastic about this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?userid=fDny65qdxn3EJH0PZbCxIw  We got takeout:  * Half Caprese Pizza (Fresh Homemade Mozarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Garlic, Fresh Basil, Pecorino Romano & Freshly Sliced Tomatoes) - I didin't see tomatoes, but I didn't hold it against them. I think we may have gotten the Margherita instead. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=k6KdshrFJ1aX3_c36fHtpw * Half Cheese Pizza * Meat Lovers (Pepperoni, Meatball, Sausage, Ham, Bacon, Extra Cheese) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=ZS6DxijAx51SqPI-4ZY7qg * Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=-zSvKvsXY6-Ih7KYhuGDNw  The fresh homemade mozzarella on the caprese (or margherita) was fantastic. That, the tangy sauce, and the fresh basil elevated the pizza to the elusive 5 star status. The crust was a little chewier than I prefer, but this is truly one of the best pizzas I've had (and yes, I've been to Italy).  The cheese pizza was delicious and well-balanced, adult and kid-friendly. Mr. L and our friends enjoyed the meat lovers special. The meat toppings were very generous. Our salad was fresh and tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r64n5_4dwTJ-qHZJgJGz1w?select=JLSU9y1uIHG-2QHJp-SbOQ  This is a family-run business and our friends say the chefs are from Italy. I didn't confirm if they are from Italy, but the pizza sure tastes the way I think it should. On our next visit to Goodyear, I will be happy to return."}
{"text":"Good Italian food just a couple of blocks from my house.  They have comfortable ambiance a little nicer than the other original restaurant.  Other comments about the food are on point.  However, I have gotten soggy pizza and watery salad in take out orders.  Hopefully this is just growing pains.  Consistent quality is the result of good leadership in the kitchen.  I will continue to visit, but for now, my first choice is the original location that is a couple of miles away."}
{"text":"great pizza and fantastic pasta.  They are very nice people and attentive.  At first I was confused because I thought there was waiters but it turns out you order at counter first and then they bring you the food... definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Taste of Italy since moving to Estrella Mountain Ranch. We did carry out. The calzone I ordered was the special and I thought it was really good. The dough was a little over cooked on top, but A LOT of cheese! We also got hot wings, and they were exactly what you'd expect from a NY style pizza joint. I can't comment on the service since it was just carry out, but the inside of the restaurant was clean and inviting. All in all I'd recommend them considering the only other option for pizza nearby is Papa Johns."}
{"text":"There is no where else for the best Italian food in the Southwest Valley. We have enjoyed the delicious food and friendly service here for several years. Pizza, pasta, sandwiches - it's all good!"}
{"text":"I've had the Sicilian Pizza, panzarotti, and an antipasto salad. I too, being from Chicago, was looking for a good pizza place in the area. I chose the Sicilian becasue it was the closest thing to a Giordano's stuffed pizza, (which I was craving), and I'm not really a fan of thin-crust pizza. Pizza was pretty good, but I didn't like it as much the 2nd time I had it. (Maybe I was \"jonesing\" too badly for that stuffed pizza the first time?)  I should give the thin crust a try though- it is their specialty and lots of people were ordering it- even the Goodyear police officer in line.  The panzarotti was really good- (4 stars). It was baked and stuffed with cheesy and saucy goodness! Antipasto not good. They cut paper thin pieces of lunch meat/ cheese on top of head lettuce. More like a cheap salad. Don't waste your money on this one. Also- no giardiniera? What's up with that? They never even heard of it? Is that just a Chicago delicacy?   I would definitely check these guys out if you live in south Goodyear. They also have pitchers of beer/pizza specials and a couple of tv's with some sort of sporting event on. I'm just not sure if they're really Italian, (never heard of giardiniera?) but hey- as long as they cook like it."}
{"text":"Being that we do not have a lot of choices within 15 minutes of our house, I am sure glad that Taste of Italy is one of the few.  They have great food! The pizza and wings are fantastic!   Great Lunch Specials with a slice of Pizza.Family Owned and Operated.   Plan ahead though as most nights it gets busy, being that this is almost the ONLY restaurant up the hill. Sometimes your wait can be very long, The food is well worth the wait.   Thank you Taste of Italy for being \"local\" to Estrella Mountain Ranch!"}
{"text":"We have been a regular customer for quite some years now, this pizza place is really good and their customer service is even better. We will always be loyal customers."}
{"text":"After visiting a customer the boss and I were in the mood for lunch and being a perfect day in the Valley of the Sun we were looking for a place with outdoor seating and Yelp guided us here. It was noon and the dining room was virtually empty which made for easy seating and quick service. Order at the counter, get a number and they bring your entree when it is ready. Ordered a slice of the Taste of Italy Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom, Green Bell Pepper, Red Onion), side salad and a soda for $8.95 plus tip. The salad was very carrot heavy. The pizza crust wasn't cracker style but more had the mouthfeel of stale and the sauce didn't bring much tomato flavor. The slice was small and had the look and taste of struggle. A war was waged against the proteins by the veggies and cheese and they had advanced and pushed my proteins to one side. I was left with my proteins straddled to one side and a veggie pizza for the most part. In my world the veggies enhance the proteins they can't be the star. The final blow was as we were getting ready to leave I noticed a lunch deal on the back of the menu touting two slices and a drink for $5.50. Shame on me for not knowing the menu front to back on my first visit but I would like to think the server might have mentioned it since it would have saved me a few bucks and netted me a second slice. On second thought scratch that."}
{"text":"This place has always been consistently good.  Never been disappointed with the food.  Menu is not real big but what they serve is top notch"}
{"text":"We finally have given up on this \"pizza\". Card board with cheese and toppings is New York style or any other style. I thought papa johns was bad until we got the card board pie tonight. At least it was hot when it was delivered. Sorry to blast a once good local pizza but order at your own risk."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. But I wouldn't say it's good pizza. Doesn't really have much flavor. The sauce is lacking. It was also very greasy. I would eat it if I had to or someone was paying, but we would not choose to come here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Mozzarella sticks and steak & mushroom sandwich to die for!!!! Great service! Authentic Italian !"}
{"text":"Always great New York style pizza. Buy by the slice and cover it with your favorite toppings."}
{"text":"YUM! We were hesitant for a while to come here because it's attached to a gas station and can walk through to it from the restaurant. But I was craving pizza for a while and hoping to find some good and closer to home. Happy I gave this a shot because the food is awesome! It was pretty packed when we came, kinda reminded me of a sports bar but with Italian food. They have several TVs with sports on to watch. Definitely not the traditional Italian feel and the tables weren't cleaned off very well, fingerprints and little grease marks here and there shined on almost all the tables. You walk up to the counter here to order, and they'll bring the food to your table.  We ended up getting a couple pizzas and some small jalapeño poppers. Warning that both come out BOILING hot! And I only got to finish a couple slices of the pie because it was still hot halfway through. However the food is DELICIOUS! We customized a veggie pizza and they actually load the pizza up with veggies unlike most other places who barely sprinkle them on. The crust was my favorite part, not too thick not too thin, perfectly crunchy. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now! We saw several people with pasta dishes that looked really good, we'll have to try some next time! Just docked the star for the cleanliness of the tables, floor, and the bathrooms were also a little gross with dirty toilet seats, pretty old. Food however was really fresh, excellent through and through, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Decent food, good neighborhood place. Pasta and wings are better than the pizza. Like the neighborhood vibe in this place on a Friday night."}
