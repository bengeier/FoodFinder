{"text":"A very good bbq joint.  Ribs were cooked perfectly, the special ribeye was naming the best steaks I have ever had, but really could just sit here and eat garlic bread and bacon all day long. So good!"}
{"text":"Finally got to Big Crow with a few friends. Good atmosphere as I like the outdoors feel as the place is semi-open. Had the flank steak and others had ribs. Really solid food and reasonably priced for the portion size. Had to say the most surprising part was the garlic bread with roasted cloves of garlic. Definitely an original twist.  Servers were really nice, although it was a little loud. Only downside was that we had to wait for a while because they had given our reservation to someone else with the same name."}
{"text":"This place is ok, nothing amazing. The cornbread is a standout dish which was a bit surprising. Service is haphazard, but friendly. The ribs were overcooked and dry. The rest of the food was also pretty standard bbq and nothing overly amazing. Portions are not huge. I probably wouldn't go back or recommend to others, as there are other plenty of other bbq joints in the city to check out. It seems hard for restaurants to do really good ribs - so it is probably a timing thing or something."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very casual also service was very friendly. Had the whole fish and ribs.  Amazing.!!!!! Reasonably priced.  Will go back for more in the future for sure."}
{"text":"Is this all some sort of a joke? Is the emperor wearing any clothes?  A waiter with terrible teeth sits down next to us uninvited and whispers amid all the din. Yes, yes, I know this is supposed to be a style a la certain American restaurants (the sitting down uninvited part, not the teeth part; American student waiters usually have perfect teeth). Sorry, never been a fan, but let's move on.  The drinks come in Hobbit-sized glasses while sporting outlandish prices. The famous chef didn't personally tend the orange groves that produced the cartoned Tropicana OJ, did he?  The ribs with pear is curious. Oh, I love thinking \"outside the box\", and I love ribs, and I love pears. Give me weird food. I'm game. But there's gotta be a point to it. The ribs are edible but nothing to write home about. The pear on the side is quite tasty, except it does nothing to rescue the sad ribs. Why are they together? To distract from the utter blandness of the meat? To disguise the poor skills of the pit master? Why not add anchovy in there too, even more fun.  The sausage (wurst?) is another forgettable concoction, overly dry like its rib cousin.  Considering the prices, the whole situation is a fiasco. I cast incomprehensible looks at the happy diners around me. Somehow they've convinced themselves that they are having a great time eating super cool food. They are free to continue with their charade. I'm outta here."}
{"text":"Went here for an event the other night and it is seriously delicious! It's got a fun kind of sugar bush feel to it too since it is in a little cabin. The staff was super friendly and the food was excellent - so were the drinks!  Just a short walk from the subway as well :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is ok. The food is awful and really expensive. The ribs were dry, salty, and had pesto instead of bbq sauce which overpowered whatever smokiness the ribs had. Pesto was good on its own. The pickles weren't good, baba ganoush wasnt good either. I tried a piece of the tri-tip and that was good. Drinks are also more expensive than most places. I got charged $28 for a double shot drink.   Music was all backstreet boys and nsync  Great place to take someone you hate if they're paying"}
{"text":"I had the worst brunch, ever. It was seriously bad. It was gross actually. I ended up leaving hungry! On top of that, you'll leave smelling like a fire pit. Also, whoever makes the coffee should be fired because they obviously don't drink it or they would have realized it was salty. Yes, undrinkable and salty. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for the rest of the day. (Note: sometimes ppl add a dash of salt to cheap coffee to cut down on the bitterness, I know. A dash, not a cup ppl!) And when I let the server know, she remarked that they serve Maxwell House, like that was something they should be advertising! It became a game to watch other ppl order a cup and see them make faces. I still can't believe I paid for such a lousy experience.  (We had planned to eat at Rose and Sons but it was busy so the hostess suggested we try BC instead. I wish I'd ignored her advice.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for. It is tucked behind Rose & Sons and you have to walk down a narrow alley before you reach the entrance. It is also recommended that you make a reservation (at least for dinner).   The rustic interior of the restaurant felt cozy and inviting. Eating as a group of four allowed us to order quite a few dishes to share:  - red pine salmon poke - delicious and chock full of peanuts  - chilli garlic broccoli - perfectly grilled and the chilli sauce actually has heat! - smoked country beef verscht - the apricot glaze was yummy but the beef was so-so - baby back ribs - the ribs were excellent but we had mixed feelings about the sage pear pesto. It complimented well with the ribs but the pear could have been cut into smaller pieces or pureed because the bigger cuts made for an awkward eating experience.  - cornbread - doused in maple syrup? delicious!   Overall, everything was great. I wouldn't order the verscht again but I recommend everything else. The server was friendly but hard to track down when it got busy."}
{"text":"The appetizer salmon poke is delicious.  The frito  is not bad but can make at home.  The steak  and lobster and ribs not bad. It is a little pricey though.  Good experience. I would come back."}
{"text":"Food is great, but portions could be a little bigger considering it's a barbecue place."}
{"text":"A perfect bbq experience! Our server - Ryan - was super knowledgable and enthusiastic and helped us eat our faces off. Baby back ribs were smoky and served with this righteous pesto, we had the special which was a flank steak with chimichurri (ahmaazing) and slaw and potato salad. All fabulous. The space itself is really unique, outdoor but very cozy, and smoky but in a really nice way. Shared an ice cream sandwich that was the most literal interpretation ever - brioche bun FTW. Can't wait to go back and eat everything else!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so looking forward to a delicious meal as Big Crow is hailed as one of the best BBQ restaurants in Toronto. We eat out quite often and in comparison to some of the other BBQ joints in the city, we were very confused at why most of the reviews were so positive.  We ordered the Corn bread, Mac N Cheese, and a full rack of ribs. We saved room for dessert, but after seeing that each dish was so mediocre, we didn't bother with ordering dessert. The ribs: the middle few pieces were juicy, but for the most part the ribs were dry inside and out (as it was only a dry rub).  I like hipster places and thought the cabin was very cute, but for the 3 dishes plus a drink, the bill came to $84.  You'll have better luck going to other places like Smoque N Bones or Barque."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it to the Big Crow tonight.  After reading the rave reviews and going over the pictures we were super excited to finally checked it out for ourselves. The cozy atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff is easy going and friendly. The menu is short and right to the point, which makes it easy to select your meals, even for the indecisive crowd:) you know who you are! Now the food; good but nothing out of this world. The Ceasar salad is a true 4 star salad with the right amount of dressing for all you health freaks. The baby back ribs were topped with pesto source which just didn't do it for me. Over priced broccoli and 14 dollar drinks were just mediocre. Overall worth a try. Hope this help folks."}
{"text":"This place is on the top of my list! Love the casual outdoor setting, and the food is out of this world. Who knew a corn bread could be so life changing! Great service, great cocktails, amazing experience."}
{"text":"This place is cool. I'll give them that.   Cocktails were not bad -- although the margarita seemed a little weak.   Corn was great. Although at $7 it better be. Shrimp app was delicious -- the sauce was killer; the shrimps were well glazed; the pumpkin seeds added a nice touch. The guac it comes with was good but perhaps out of place. The dish needed a further textural contrast -- a few tortilla chips would have been nice.   The ribs. Wow. These weren't good. They were undercooked. Not like raw; like tough and dry. You could see that the meat hadn't pulled back from the bone at all really. They needed some more time in the smoker. I don't want mushy (overcooked) fall off the bone ribs but they failed to find the happy medium here. Also, take the membrane off. Its gross and it doesn't make you look any more 'authentic.' It just gets stuck in your teeth. Finally, the pesto. I don't even know what to say. It's not a bad pesto but why is it on this dish? It makes no sense. It's just a greasy mess. It's richness on richness.   Slaw wasn't great.   Ice-cream smore sandwich is a cool idea but get rid of the bun. It's either stale or too cold from the ice cream. Either way it makes no sense.   I wanted to like this place. I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The ambiance is A+. Definitely a unique space, especially considering that it is in the middle of the city. I felt like I was in the middle of the woods. The food is delicious, served family style so you get to try a good portion of the menu, depending on the size of your group. We especially enjoyed the trout and the feature (pork sausage). The cocktails were very good (the Cesar, just ok). The service is casual, attentive and personal, with good suggestions. One bill for the group but they make it easy by dividing up the drinks into categories and taking separate payments. We spent about $30-35 each on the food (tax included) and left a happy full, guys and girls alike. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ spot in a unique location. I agree with the other reviews about it being loud, and the communal seating might not be for everyone. But the food and drinks are great, tons of flavor and good sized portions. For a casual Friday night date it's a winner!"}
{"text":"Wow, just Wow.  Although this is my first time ever having real BBQ, I doubt it will be topped any time soon. The restaurant is situated in a nice and cozy wood structure in the back of rose and sons which gives it a camp-like atmosphere. When we arrived we did not have reservations however the nice and welcoming staff had a spot available for my friend and I to sit.  When it came to the food we decided to order a half rack or ribs, the salmon poke, the cornbread and the broccoli salad. First of all, I have to say do not come here without getting the ribs. I am not a huge meat eater but these ribs were TO DIE FOR! Although it seems strange to order poke at a BBQ restaurant, this was hands down the second best dish from our meal. It was very nicely balanced with the chips and was a pleasant surprise, a must order in my opinion! The cornbread was great and I thought the broccoli salad was nothing special, however it was good to cut through the heaviness of everything else.   When I go out, I never skimp on dessert so my friend and I decided to split the S'mores Ice Cream Sandwich. The sandwich was good, but not amazing by any standards. I found the bun to be a bit bland but the ice cream, presentation and marshmallows all made it worth the money.   For two people, we left with a doggy bag of leftovers from the sides however we both felt full but not overly stuffed. With a cider each and the food split down the middle, the total came to $50 each. For the quality and amount of food we had, I think this was a fair price.  All and all, the atmosphere, the food and the family style presentation make this place a huge winner in my books. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten in the restaurant (yet) but was at a party catered by them and the food was delicious so I am going to try in house next weekend!"}
{"text":"Been twice, thoroughly enjoyed both visits. The burst tomato pesto on the ribs was the perfect complement and I could probably eat ten orders of the thuet bread and bacon.   Some might not enjoy the communal benches but it makes for good eavesdropping!"}
{"text":"Good food but small, overpriced portions. Servers struggle to provide regular service to tables.  Went for food once and was disappointed, went for drinks with a group another time and paid $22.59 for two beers! Gonna have to save up for the next couple months before I can afford to share my thoughts."}
{"text":"We tried to grab brunch at Rose and Sons but the wait was too long so went to Big Crow instead.  The restaurant itself is really cool - a cabin / woodsy type of place.  I thought the coal baked brie was very good, especially the garlicky bread that it came with.  I also had the smoked mozzarella and roast garlic bread sandwich - which was good but really not that filling, even though we shared the brie before our meals came. My friend was really not a fan of the bbq bacon that came w/ her meal. Glad we tried this place, as it really is a cool restaurant, but the food was not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"I love all of Anthony Rose's restaurants, but Big Crow will always be my favourite, especially after this weekend! We had a group of ten dine here for my birthday on Saturday, and it was a phenomenal experience all-around. Our server was outstanding, drinks were delicious, food was out-of-this world.   We got the cheapest of the family-style large group options, and it was more than enough food for everyone - I have a couple nights worth of leftovers to look forward to!   We had a few pitchers of sangria (the pitchers are small but the drinks are good), some beers and shots (The $11 option is my choice, love Henderson's), and our DD enjoyed Coke (thanks, DD). We ate: Caesar salad (the best), pickles (I haven't found anyone else in Toronto that does new pickles - I LOVE new pickles), smoked mozzarella garlic bread, country beef salami (my favourite thing on the menu!), baby back ribs, the jw bird... and all four sides. With a selection of bars for dessert. Everything was amazing, except for the potato salad... but that's mostly because I don't like potato salad.  Including tax and tip, it came out to about $60 a person which was really reasonable giving how much we ate (and drank).   A HUGE thank-you to the entire team at Big Crow, especially our server (I wish I could remember his name!), and Marlowe and Chelsea on the events team - my boyfriend organized everything and said they were great to work with. I had an awesome birthday thanks to these guys.... see you next year?"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for dinner and we shared the full rack of ribs with a side of kimchi and everything was super tasty. Loved the vibe of the place and the staff were also very friendly.   It was so good we went back the next weekend for brunch - we shared the beef brisket garlic bread sandwich with the sweet and sexy grits (didn't expect it to be so soupy) but it was deliciously filling. Again the staff were awesome and made us great brunch cocktails.   Definitely going back and recommending to friends!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very cool, in a ski lodge style barn. Service was good and our server was helpful, could have pointed out that we way over ordered but no big deal.   The food was just ok. Had the garlic bread - yum!! Ribs (not great) and flank steak with beans and potato gratin. EVERYTHING was way too salty, I like salt but this was crazy. My husband and I drank 3 pints of water when we got home and still woke up with a raging thirst. I watched the chef seasoning the meat in the open kitchen and one large steak got 5 handfuls of salt, really??!!!  Go for the experience but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Visit here with 2 fellow diners last night as we've been to Rose & Sons (and are big fans!) and had been meaning to visit this backyard barbecue house for some time now. Unfortunately we picked a rather frigid night, and if you didn't know this -- this restaurant is pretty much a loosely tarped patio so if you visit in the winter, layer up and bring scarves and a hat.  The service here is fantastic -- very down to earth, friendly and courteous -- as you would expect from an Anthony Rose establishment.   We were promptly brought water as we seated, although given the frigit temperature in the restaurant, some sort of complimentary hot beverage would have been the jump to 5-stars for Big Crow.  We shared all the food ordered:  * Caeser Salad: fresh and crisp with a unique dressing that made this common salad a bit untraditional yet a welcomed rendition of this classic (7/10)  * BBQ Beef Ribs: finger-lickin marinade and cooked to perfection, these ribs were amazing! Comes with a small garnish of cucumber salad that pairs nicely with the meat. I would order this again (7/10) * JW Bird: a generous portion of succulent and juicy cornish hen topped with a delicious salsa verde (8/10) * 1/2 Rabbit: juicy and succulent large pieces of rabbit with an incredible honey hot sauce on top (8/10)   They do offer a $25 Hibernation Dinner that is basically a generous chef's tasting menu with many offerings from each of the categories on the menu. I'll know where to go when I'm really hungry.  The rating really should be a 4.5 but because of the temperature in there being so uncomfortable and needing to wear my winter jacket and hat without being offered anything to warm up, my review comfortably sits at a 4.  I'd return -- but never again in the winter!"}
{"text":"It's an inviting oasis of BBQ'd meat at the end of a dirty ally. Very fun relaxed environment, and the food is pretty good. Not the best ribs i've ever had, but not bad. It's pretty good quality with absolutely zero pretentiousness, unless your interpretation of pretentious is chill hipsters and tattooed wait staff."}
{"text":"The redeeming elements in the Big Crow experience are the excellent quality of the meat and the presence of an open fire pit, but man are the prices sinful ... and I was also left wondering why they were determined to make a distinct impression by replacing traditional bbq sauce or rub with pesto."}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've had in a very long time. The perfect place on a nice summer night.   Go on Fridays for the whole smoked pig."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about the pork belly and the garlic child broccoli 18 hours later.  Don't pass up the chance to have a pitcher of bourbon and root beer."}
{"text":"Big crow came highly recommended by a coworker of mine and I was stoked to try it out.  This place is a bit off the beaten path  and it's literally a shed in a back alley.  I liked the cabin look of the restaurant but was not really impressed that we were sat so close to the kitchen even tho we were the only two ppl there.  Our server was super knowledgable and did not hesitate to make lots of recommendations. I got a Hanky Panky cocktail special which I originally thought was $7 but was actually $14 how is this a special price? Lol  We got the Shrimp Diablo as an appetizer. This is probably the best shrimp dish I had in a while. We had a full rack of ribs as our main which was tasty but not the best in Toronto as they dare advertise.  Overall the food was good but overpriced."}
{"text":"I am torn between 3.5 and 4 stars, but I did enjoy myself, so I'll lean upward.   Having been to Rose and Sons, and enjoying both that experience and BBQ in general, we were excited to go to Big Crow. I enjoyed the communal tables and the general ambiance of a camp dining lodge done up with hipster touches, but fair warning: it's loud. If you have any kind of conversation, it'll have to be at a volume that invites eavesdropping. (More fun when the people at your elbows aren't spending their entire meal discussing the merits of moving to the South Kingsway or putting $100k into your $700k home to sell it at $1.2. Really? This is two hours' worth of conversation?? Ok, ok, not the resto's fault, but just to illustrate how communal dining has its pitfalls.)  We enjoyed the Caesar salad with bbq'd bacon slab draped over it (although we didn't actually order the bacon option -- amidst the din, our server misheard us) and grilled shrimp with thousand island dressing, cocktail sauce, and Ritz crackers (David could have done without the Ritz crackers, but I have a soft spot for them), but off the bat noticed the salt quotient.   Our taste buds continued alternately singing and shriveling at the Miami ribs (tangy, rich, salty) and the baby back ribs with walnut (?) pesto (hint of spice, lots of salt -- without the pesto mostly just smoke flavour; with the pesto much more interesting). Coleslaw was tasty, not too creamy or too vinegary. Did I sense a saltiness in it too? Hard to tell by then -- my taste buds were inured by the rest.   Glad we went, don't need to go back. David does BBQ as well, if not better, and without the salt (I was up twice in the night for a drink of water). A fun place to go, though, especially on a crisp late-summer evening."}
{"text":"Great for a finger licking shared meal. The ribs are my favourite while the puttanesca fish and whole chicken are a very very close second. I like to go with enough people so I can order all three. The bakermans bar is a must have desert you'll find very hard to share."}
{"text":"Sorry, I call 'hype' on this place. And/or a lot of drunken reviews/reviewers.    Had a 2 person $100+ meal here consisting of shared ribs; beef 'verscht', coleslaw, beans and two pitchers of some delicious alcoholic goodness.  Normally that level of drunkenness would lead to love.  In this case it couldn't even make up for the meh food.  The ribs were not tender & not sliding off the bone (half portion for $18; full portion for $35!). You had to gnaw the meat off. I can personally cook better and have had better in many places, including Aft in my neighbourhood.  Came with an inoffensive smokey pesto but these ribs really would have benefited from a sauce considering their chewiness.  Everything was extra salty.   The coleslaw was good but not that special; the beans were chewy and not tender, seemed undercooked; the verscht was like a flattened hot dog with sweet apricot 'glaze' ($16!)-- basically a chunky one-note jam-- and a dinky two pieces of bread. The pitchers of watermelon sangria and some other cocktail were the only good thing.  Doesn't hold a candle in terms of quality of food or value to best bbq places either in Toronto or Brooklyn.  I actually felt embarrassed that I had suggested this place to my very unimpressed date (who normally is easy to please) and who couldn't help commenting on the various lacks.  I tried in vain to defend my choice but in the end the meal was half eaten.   Yikes.  Days later I was still thinking about the disappointment. So two stars is generous.  Hype: pitchers of booze; casual picnic table seating; a difficult to read menu; inflated prices given the setting and quality of the food.  You will like it if you: are a hipster, rarely eat BBQ, have too much disposable income for your own good, want to be in an 'it' spot and are under 34.    Service was friendly and reasonable.   Overall - quite disappointing.  Wouldn't go back.  PS - due to the open air environment, your clothing and hair *will* smell like smokey BBQ. That could be sexy if you are feeling satiated and warm and happy and all ready to move onto the next 'course'. But given the experience, it just added insult to injury."}
{"text":"The ribs here are to die for!   The atmosphere feels like a rustic chalet and it feels like a hidden secret space behind Rose and Sons. I left smelling like BBQ and I am not complaining!"}
{"text":"The food is yummy, though I think Rose and Sons is a hundred times better. But it's so loud that if you're actually looking to enjoy the company of the people you're with, better to go somewhere else. We did even ask them to turn it down since it was a relatively slow night and we were with a distinguished older guest, but they didn't. If you're in the mood for loud and messy and kinda chaotic, it's a fun place. And I think it's better for brunch because the light is nice."}
{"text":"This place has a phenomenal atmosphere and wonderful staff, but it is overpriced and food is medium.   The highlight was the Steelhead Trout Poke. It was awesome. I'm not sure the portion is worth $16, but it was damn tasty. The other highlight was the pickle appetizer - not the whole platter, which was underwhelming, but specifically the pickled red bell peppers that had a lovely combination of pickled sourness and pepper sweetness.  The balance of the food was not great. We had a $32 striploin steak cooked medium rare that was fine, at best. Our friends ordered the chicken and had great things to say about it. And then we collectively shared desserts: a fudge brownie square and a bakermans. Each was $7 and dry.  Overall, I'd return for drinks, the vibe, the warmth, the trout poke and the staff, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Food is great but be warned -The sign outside says \"cash and debit only\", so we asked if they take credit cards and they said yes.  However when the bill came they wouldn't accept our amex.  They also charged us extra so make sure you double check your bill before you pay.   On a brighter note: get their smoked chicken wings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  Great service  Well done bbq   Salmon and garlic bread my fave!  Take your friends and have an amazing time"}
{"text":"Been there around 10 times during my year in Toronto. I left the city 3 weeks ago and I already miss the place. The atmosphere is amazing. Be careful if you don't like crowded and noisy place. That place is definitely like that even on the week days. I love it though. Started last winter and Brent there almost every month since. The staff is always helpful and try to be as nice as possible even when it's really busy. Let's talk about the food now. What can I say? Good quality and always the right flavors. Loved the sauerkraut last winter, the pork belly and green dandelions this summer and the smoked country beef and apricot glaze lately. Super seasonal as always.   As good for a couple than a bunch of friends.  Why 4 stars and not 5? A little too expensive but that's what you get when you have a trendy/meaty place right?   Thumbs up.  I will pass by again if I come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  It was a little chilly outside but the fire pit made it so nice and warm.  It also helped that we were the table right in front of it.  In addition the food was so good.   I had the baby back ribs with the Caesar salad.  Both items had a special kick to it that I have never tasted before.  If you are around the area you should definitely try this place.  Such a great chill spot with great food."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends and although initially their was some confusion to the location we found it tucked away behind a funky looking hamburger joint. Walking towards the entrance you instantly catch the wiff of burning wood and gets the mind thinking of  all the delicious meat that is cooking.  The server was instantly awesome finding us 5 of us space without having a reservation and believe me this place does have a constant flow of people.  Initially looking to get dishes individually she again came up trumps and advised us to share dishes and get one each. We went a few dishes further and got most the main items.  The Salmon poke was great and just the write amount of salmon and not drowned too much in whatever it was. The chicken drums were kind of dry and did not care much for those.  The Korean ribs were awesome as was the full rack of ribs we got. Those had to be my two fav dishes.   For 5 of us it came to a decent overall price so definitely worth the time and money to go to this location."}
{"text":"I had really liked this place when we first went a few years back but I recently visited because I was in the neighbourhood and while much is the same, a few things I felt I should point out. The food is as I remembered is well seasoned, cooked perfectly and worth every penny. Initially it seemed little but it is quite filling. The potato salad isn't your average salad but it's good. It loses a star for its cocktails, I ordered their special punch which tasted like water, it had the rose gin but I couldn't taste it at all. I also ordered a Cesear and it was watered down as well and you couldn't taste the alcohol. The two cost $34, not worth it. And therefore has lost a star.   The atmosphere is great, it gets busy, so make a reservation. We ate at the high top tables which do not have stools. the waitstaff are friendly but they were constantly distracted amongst themselves that, we waited like 15 mins to get someone's attention to get a machine to pay, this is after we told two different staff members we will need a machine."}
{"text":"I went here about 2 months ago (I know a little slow on the review) which was a cold winter evening. It's a tented, almost outdoor patio but it was very warm and if you needed they provided blankets. The food definitely does the trick and warms you right up. We got a full rack of ribs and 3 sides; grits, their broccoli, and potato salad. It was all very delicious! The ribs were a perfect balance of crispy outside and tender, fall off-the-bone meat covered in a fantastic wet rub. The sides were all very delicious, especially the broccoli and grits. It was a ton of food for 2 people so bring your appetite. I look forward to going back here in the summer months. One of the best BBQ places in the city right now without a doubt. I also had their root beer and bourbon which was nice and heavy on the bourbon and really complimented the meal. Another reason I had no trouble staying warm and satisfied."}
{"text":"No idea why this place is so highly rated. The popular ribs were dry and tough like jerky... and so heavily charred that all we tasted was smoky carbon.  The salmon poke was very nice, but I was so grossed out by the ribs that I can't rate higher. This is supposed to be a BBQ restaurant!   If you like tender ribs forget about this place. For the price you can go to so many better restaurants."}
{"text":"Do you know what the word 'crow' means in BBQanese? It means feed. Thus the name of this restaurant should be known as Big Feed, Big Meal, Big Portion... take your pick, it all means the same delicious thing.  Opened about a year ago, Big Crow is the back porch BBQ addition to Rose & Sons restaurant just on Dupont. The entrance is a little hidden, but just think about walking around the back of your friends place when you were a kid going over to play in the backyard - ya just like that, but instead of play, you're going to eat.. and eat... and eat.... and EAT.  We were part of group of 18 guys here for a bachelor party and apparently the best option for a group that size was to do their prix fixe option of $65/person. Normally i shudder at the idea of prix fixe sharing dinners as it ends up being a fight for food and everyone (being Canadian) is always feeling guilty and apologizing for eating the last bite - except for me, I never apologize when it comes to food #sorryNOTsorry.  Before the food began to arrive, I partook in a few cocktails, most notably the Purple Jesus, which from frat part experience, had all the same delicious notes without the extra additives from being mixed in someones bathtub - it happens, and it's delicious. Their PJ, shy of being served in a Red Solo Cup (tm), was spot on and even more delicious than I ever remembered.  The food began, and I'm going to try and mention everything that came out to give you an idea of everything that was included but forgive me if I forget because there was so much! Just know everything on this menu was incredible, plentiful and we all walked out stuffed.  - Over-sized pickles - Salmon Nachos (almost like a civiche) - Garlic cheese bread - HUGE smoked/BBQd shrimp cocktail - Whole white fish - Chimmi-churri topped rack of ribs - flank steak - Cornish hen filets - potato salad  - BBQ baked beans - Even options for those with religious dietary and vegetarian restrictions (I partook in neither, but was told they were equally unreal). - Finished off with an assortment of delicious dessert squares  There was probably more... I honestly blacked out and ate until my face and fingers hurt. I have no shame, and neither should you when you eat at Big Crow  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends and it was the best idea anyone could of ever had.   We started off with beers, and proceeded to order with some sweet suggestions from our very helpful waitress (she was amazing, I wish I got her name so people could have her as a waitress as well).   The ambiance was like a high end sugar shack with cowhides tacked on the seats. But I can't talk about the ambiance, I gotta talk about the food.   We got the sauerkraut and pickles, the caesar salad and the garlic bread to start. Ok. I need to just talk a very explicit, sexual game about the garlic bread... Smoked mozzarella. Need I say more? Apparently there were three types of butter on this thing. I think my face melted when this entered my mouth... No wait, it did. It was melting with the cheese. I've never had better garlic bread.   For our main course we got the smoked chicken, pork and beans, and their ribs. DUDE. The ribs were amazing but I think I preferred the chicken with chimichurri on top. Not a pork and bean fan normally but I've been converted (my inner fat kid knows what's up!) I probably still smell like a BBQ smoke house. This was seriously one of the most epic, enjoyable meals I've had in Toronto. It had all the fixings of a good restaurant.  We were four so I definitely recommend coming here and getting a bunch of different things off the menu. The menu was a little on the pricey side but who cares when there's eating this good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Big Crow wasn't as good as I remembered from the first visit. And definitely don't come here if you're starving. The food can take a long time to arrive. The ribs have a great flavour but it's not fall of the bone tender, the shrimp is probably my favourite, and the ice cream sandwich with a fresh bun are fantastic. However, the service can be hit or miss - I hate that they constantly try to get you to order the bigger portion or more food. The BBQ Caesar is also inconsistent - it was really watery the last time but it does come with a slab of bacon."}
{"text":"I have been living in the neighborhood for almost a year and never ventured around which really is a travesty. I had come across Big Crow on yelp and remarked that they were only a 10 minute walk from me and how I had to try it out!  My wonderful bf made resos here to celebrate some job success I had (super braggy I know).  We arrived slightly early, gave our name and the hostess was enthusiastic \"Oh yes! We have a table for you!\" - She seated us and then promptly poured two glasses of bubbly. Apparently when making the resos online, they prompt you to call them if its a special celebration and they help you think a way to celebrate. They suggested a glass of bubbly and my bf (ever the smart one) said absolutely -  I have trained him well (just kidding).  For food we got:  - full rack of ribs - jerk chicken wings - cornbread - mac n cheese  It is all family style (my favorite way of eating) and it was all delicious. The ribs have this great pear pesto on top, the wings aren't spicy at all but do have a great pineapple salsa on top, and the mac n cheese was cheesy without being heavy (pro tip: put some pesto in the mac n cheese - heavenly)  The standout to me was the cornbread. It is a huge slice and ladled on top is this beautiful chilli maple sauce. I remarked to our server on how they should bottle the sauce and sell it and he came back out with two little containers for me to take home (not before explaining to me how they make - home made hot sauce yall)! I was smitten at this point. Just smitten.   Everything is made with in season ingredients, which is why they couldn't make me their blood orange cocktail but he asked what I liked in a drink and came back with a delicious beverage.   On top of great food, and great service - the atmosphere is laid back and fun. It is located in the alleyway behind rose and sons in a giant shed.   I will definitely be back - and hope to score more of the chilli maple sauce!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the city! Great atmosphere and even better food. Was my first time here and would definitely say it won't be my last. Nothing like this in the city, and the food is incredibly creative and delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped by at about 7:30 looking for a last minute table. They weren't able to seat us inside, but offered me a standing spot outside.   We ordered the Poke nachos, squash and a half rack of ribs, as well as a pitcher of their drink special, the Algonquin iced tea. It was a take on the long island iced tea with tequila, vodka, rum and... something else. Mixed with ginger bitter and ginger beer. It was delicious! The portions are large, we had one app, one side and one main and it was more than enough.  Service was great, even though we were outside and sitting away from the main eating area.  I would go back again. Even if it was just to smell the smokey campfire smell that works it way into your hair and clothes (that's a good thing!)"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo cozy. Went for a birthday party and the family style meal that came out was top notch. The fish done ceviche style melted was so delicious. Ceaser salad was killer. The ribs were not amazing but I think that might have been because everything else was so good. Our server was probably the best server I've ever had. He was super conscience of allergies at our table, on too of our drink orders and water refills, explained each dish that came  out in a way that made your so excited to dig in. He loved the food and his job and it showed. Loved this place, looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It's a nice, cozy, heated wood cabin-like structure located down a short alleyway. Very unassuming store front, I would have easily walked past it if my friend wasn't waiting outside.   A few must try food items: It was a three way tie for the Baby back ribs - smoky, delectable and perfect for sharing.  The reuben sandwich - huge slices of meat, soft bread, the grainy mustard ties all the flavours together The dirty bird - so tender and flavourful  A couple a nods: The frito pie - basically your Taco Bell fries supreme toppings on Fritos. It's disgustingly satisfying but it's also $11.  I would order it again. I would also make it at home before a Netflix binge session.  The broccoli - got a nice kick to it and a nice change from all the meat entrees   A couple of no-nos Ketchup chips - it's Covered Bridge ketchup chips and served in a bag for $11. Not worth the money.  Baked beans - nothing fancy here. Could definitely do without it.   It's nice to go with a group of 5-6 so you can try a few dishes.   Cocktails were delicious too. I tried a few of them and you can't go wrong with any. It all depends what you're in the mood for. They range between $10-14"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded our expectations. We eat out alot and have been to many of Toronto's best BBQ/smokehouses, and this one was hands down THE BEST. You need a reservation because it is a small place, tucked away behind Rose and Son's, their flagship restaurant. Most seating is at long communal picnic tables, but there is good separation with pillars. We were seated right by the door, because I made the resi last minute, and the heaters kept us plenty warm, so there is not a bad seat in the house. See my photos, which show a menu as well. So....wines are well-selected, with a limited offering but solid choices. Beers are varied and all good. There are a few cocktails, and I had the bourbon and root beer. LOVED this combo. We ate through most items on the menu, and the beautiful thing here is that each offering is unique, and lovely, and incredible. Most smokehouses slather one of two sauces on every meat. Not this one. This one makes every dish unique, and the tastes are completely different. From pesto to spicy, to traditional, to Korean, the dishes here are all superb. LOVED the garlic and smoked cheese bread. OH MY. And the Smores cake? Died and went to heaven. Our server, Ryan, had me in stitches the whole night. This is not a formal place. This is a fun, loud, happening place, where there is zero pretense, so get ready to use your Wet Naps....you are going to need them!"}
{"text":"There is no getting around the fact that outdoor seating in Toronto in the middle of winter is a little on the crazy side, but the food and service were both exceptional. It was well worth the slight lack of comfort due to the weather. I will be back but wearing more layers next time.   Plan ahead as its cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Our server was aggressively trying to upsell us drinks. They don't take credit cards. The default tip option on the debit machine is 20%.   Fine dining pricing for humble food in a backyard setting.   I'm glad I went once but I don't need to go again."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! The baby back ribs were incredibly well cooked and the corn was amazing! I'm a huge fan of slaw and I felt that it just wasn't anything special; the flavour wasn't there.  My only complaint would be the service. My friend and I (two girls) went and were introduced to the menu as family style, which we knew going in and we often share food. We were told it's typical to get 4 plates. We had the ribs, slaw and corn to share. When we ordered it we felt a bit of judgement - 'how are your appetites, the corn is only one ear'; and 'Most people order more than this'. We share food all the time and know how much we can eat. I don't go to a restaurant to get stuffed, I go to enjoy the food and come out comfortably full. We felt a bit judged the rest of the meal, it's unfortunate because the place is great and the food is delicious.   That being said it was likely a one-off thing and I would still recommend people to try it, and forsure try those ribs :)"}
{"text":"One of the coolest restaurant atmospheres in the city.  We arrived on a Wednesday around 8:30.  They were packed and still had reservations to fill, so we waited about 15-20 minutes.  While waiting we had Thomas Lavers Ginger Beer (as in the Kensington Market cannery) and Berry Red Sangria.  Both were exceptional - and they are NOT lying about their berries being boozy.  They were quite alcohol infused.  We also ordered some of the garlic bread, with low expectations and it was the smokiest, saltiest, garlicy amazing I have had.  So much garlic, so satisfying.    We then got seated and ordered the rest of our food.  1/2 rack baby back ribs.  Boyfriend said they were just okay although tender.  The verscht.  TO DIE FOR.  With mustard seed and apricot.  So.Good.  Please order this.  We had two sides: coleslaw and potato salad.  Both were a little boring.  In fact, the potato salad could use some more kick in some way.  Definitely try some of the other sides.  The service was great, the food was great or good, and we are coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Finding this place is half the fun! We went for our birthday dinner with our family and the food was so good. Sadly I don't eat pork so I missed out on a lot of the great food but what I did have was still good.  The drinks were great, too, and what a cool atmosphere. The food came quick and it was just good.  Not cheap, but you know that going in, because it's a notch above your average restaurant - it's a part of the Dupont Rose Holy Trinity, after all."}
{"text":"Whoa...BBQ'ed bacon is so good...as I lay down to sleep I thought I could feel my heart stopping...  Caesar salad came with a 1/4 lb strip of bacon, very delicious.  The sauce was a little different than a normal Caesar salad, but I like it...couldn't put my finger on it but good flavour. Bacon Caesar, which had a 1/4 lb strip of bacon as well.  They did their own twist of the Caesar with dill juice inside it.  Not my favourite, still good, and the bacon made me quickly forget about the slight change.  Tried the smoked mozzarella and roast garlic bread because of the great reviews, and so happy we got it!  Definitely a must have! BBQ Ribs were delicious as well! The special of the day was a steak with blue cheese, the meat was cooked great but the flavour was just okay. The Mexican broccoli and pork and beans were good sides with the meal. For dessert, the Bakerman bar was okay, but the PB&J ice cream sandwich was worth getting!  Portions were great, but a little salty, but I love salty so it was no problem with me.  We went in May, so it was a bit chilly because of the open roof, so I would say definitely great for a warm summer night.  Overall, service was great, food was pretty good, and we were all full from dinner which was great!  Would go back if back in that neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Is all I can say. Excellent service Ryan, you blew it out of the park!and amazing atmosphere. Small and quaint not fancy decor but it makes up on the quality of the food. When I find places like this, I feel like I hit the lotto. I'm a big time foodie."}
{"text":"Great place. A bit on the high end side of things but it's the experience. One reviewer said his 2 party bill was $160 and they left hungry. Ok people, I was in a party of 3 and we were full for $133. You see the menu, you know what you hope to get for the price ambience and food wise. So for what it was, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Just ordered from UberEats -- have ordered many times in the past, but will not longer patronise their restaurant again. Egregiously overpriced with terribly small portions. Ordered the Korean ribs -- $19 for 2.5 burnt, dry ribs. A real let down."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed by Big Crow. Ambience is great with its cool backyard setup and the food is fairly tasty but quite overpriced. The restaurant claims to be family style, as all the dishes are meant to be shared but the portions are seemingly meant for a family of two. The most ridiculous item on the menu is the garlic bread - $14 for half a loaf. I mean, it's good bread, but really?? Service is friendly but not outstanding. Good to try but I'm not in a rush to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's very rare that my husband would exclaim \"This is amazing\" for a restaurant, but that's what he said about the Trout and its side tomatoes.   We came here on a weekend day evening. Although I made a reservation (easy, online) for 5:30, we were the first ones there. Filled up quickly around 630pm.   Love the atmosphere in here, tucked away behind Rose & Sons. You walk the narrow alleyway, and your nose smells the wonderful smokey scent into a covered area with picnic tables and heaters.   The wood burning bbq and smoker is at the back, which also keeps the place warm. It's interesting how you can't smell all the food, it's well ventilated.   We ordered 3 entrees and 2 sides for the two of us. If you're planning on having dessert too, I would remove one entree.   The Grilled Trout (must!), Corn Bread side (very good, but spicy, ask to put the chilli sauce on the side if you can't take it), Coleslaw side (a must if you're having bbq), the Smoked Beef Verscht (a beef sausage, it wasn't amazing, but was good), and The Chinatown Miami Ribs (beef short ribs, similar to Kalbi. Good but not unique enough).   I definitely want to come back and try everything else on the menu. Great for groups to share. Not really children friendly. I didn't see any high chairs. This is a must for anyone that likes bbq."}
{"text":"The only amazing thing about this place is the cornbread, as it was mentioned in the previous reviews. The next best thing was cheesy grits. Other than that everything else was mediocre. I'd say if you happen to pass by this place, then check it out, otherwise this isn't a restaurant I'd go out of the way for.  Cornbread -amazing 5/5 Cheesy grit- amazing 5/5 The P.W bird- way too salty  2.5/5 Ribs- meh 3/5 chicken wings- meh only 4 pieces of DRUMBSTICKS for 16 dollars , so quite over price 2/5 all day breakfast - meh 2/5 dessert fudge brownie - 4/5 worth to try    The interior design was pretty cool but it can get chilly if it's a cold winter day. There are no insulators in the restaurant so there are many heaters. It feels very dry inside because of the heaters and the smoke from the kitchen. By the end of your visit your clothes as well as your hair will smell like smoked wood."}
{"text":"Very good! It is a hidden jewel, place is great! Beautiful setting in a backyard, all wood large picnic tables, delicious bbq and smoked items just the smell waters the mouth! The staff and the crowd very amicable, families, couples, friends.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yoooo this joint is sick!!! Pickled stuff, bbq bacon...friggin mind blowing. The swordfish was delish.flank steak and chimichurri chicken are both cooked well and very tender.   The ambiance was also solid. Service is also pretty good. The ribs were a bit on the dry side but nevertheless tasty They  do reservations for a reason, and I highly suggest you do otherwise you be lining up with the other loosebags :)"}
{"text":"Shack behind a row of buildings. Pass by a shabby outhouse on the way to the entrance to be pleasantly surprised inside. Cozy cabin in the winter, communal tables reminiscent of a Québec sugar shack, (seasonal?) menu that is compact and interesting. This is more a plaid shirt kind of night, and utensils will be given up at some point. Smoked garlic bread is a must-have so are the baby-back ribs with pesto. Corn bread packed with flavours. JW bird was tender as promised. The mains did outshine the sides (mac n cheese, potato salad). Dessert s'mores cake was slightly disappointing - wouldn't order again at the price point. Will definitely want to come back in warmer weather when parts of the roof come off."}
{"text":"Came here last night for an awesome casual dinner date. Ambiance was super cute, although a bit loud for intimate conversation. Definitely a fun spot with communal tables and good energy however! We each had an Emma Watson cocktail and shared a Caesar salad, beefsteak tomato salad, 1 lb steak, jerk rainbow trout. All were absolutely awesome and very very well done.  Overall probably arguably the best bbq I've had here in the city. Highly recommend and hope to be back soon to try more items!"}
{"text":"This is less a review and more to say that the menu format was so bloody off-putting, I've decided not to bother going here. The menu posted on their site is hectic and confusing--is the reuben sandwich really $24, or is the menu just a hideous beast who has decided that prices and words don't need to correspond?   I feel like if I had epilepsy, just looking at this menu would give me a seizure."}
{"text":"Amazing smells and great ambiance.....reminds me of being up at the lake in Northern Minnesota. They played old school rap which was pretty sweet.   Food is wonderful....baby back ribs were very, very good.  A great precursor to this meal would be the Mexican corn or the BACON!!!!!  Big Crow....is a Big Feed indeed! A bit spendy, but worth it."}
{"text":"My review for Bar Begonia is basically identical: good food, great potential, beautiful space, terrible service.  Time for the rose & sons crew to step it up. Having good taste and access to money alone does not create a welcoming, hospitable and enjoyable environment that is worth returning to. The staff need an attitude check."}
{"text":"First off, kind of hard to find. had to rely on the yelpers to find the proper entrance.  Decor is super cute, butt-heaters on the benches, nice lighting, wooden shed - takes you out of the city for a minute i love it!  food: ok. the ribs had a bit too much pesto on it, i don't think the flavor goes. the pork was good. kinda pricy for what it is.   Verdict: OK. i'm glad I tried it - my tummy just doesn't agree with that pesto sauce."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ spots in Toronto. Flank steak cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce on top. Ribs with pesto. Salmon poke with nacho chips. Even the Cesar salad is on point. Also had the sides potato salad coleslaw. Cornbread with maple syrup. It's everything u expect from a BBq spot with a slight twist and it all works. Most of the food was recommended by the waiter and we were all very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Me thinks not. I like the concept, it's so beautifully rustic, but it was a bit chilly, the food was a wee bit greasy, and the coolness factor may be better served fresh in the summer."}
{"text":"fantastic food! great service! best barbecue place in toronto. and the best thing its not a typical southern US vibe. its original and way better than some BS pulled pork with store bought bbq sauce.  ribs are incredible! baked potatoes are insanely good!  the J bird is delicious!  the poke-poke is the best thing ever!   love this restaurant! have been many times !"}
{"text":"This place has family style seating and a very relaxed atmosphere. It's located behind Rose and sons in what almost looks like a cabin in the woods. The food is a bit messy and incredibly flavorful. We had Korean short ribs, broccoli and bean salad, cornbread and salami with apricots. I would highly recommend them all! The broccoli and bean salad was slightly bland, but was the perfect palate cleanser between bites of meat. They made a drink with Bourbon, ginger beer, lime and mint that was out of this world."}
{"text":"Got takeout, not great. Ordered the baby back ribs, potatoe salad, and smoked chicken drum sticks. Personally,I think they charge way too much for the tiny portions. While I thought the taste is ok but $20 for 4 drumsticks? That's a total rip off. And $7 for 1 single scoop of potato salad? It's worth $3 at most. And the baby back ribs were small and kind of tasteless. I won't be eating or ordering from here ever again."}
{"text":"Really cool place. tucked way - great tunes.  Favourites were the Miami ribs, pickles, rib steak, beans & pumpkin cheese cake.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here maybe 40 minutes before closing and it was DEAD inside. We thought it was closed but they assured us to come inside and take a look at the menu.  A dead restaurant usually indicates to me that the food's not so great or the service might be off but this was definitely not the case.  This cabin/camp style restaurant was amazing! It was a bit chilly out and I was worried that it would be chilly in the restaurant too because it's in an outside setting but they had those patio heaters and some cute blankets rolled up and tucked away for anyone that might feel cold.  The service took a little long but they told us this when we sat down. This is a family style restaurant where everything's made fresh and there's no rush. I apologized for coming in so soon before closing and the server told me it's no worries at all. Everyone inside was so kind and hardworking."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this ribs joint. Highly recommended by a friend. But after spending more than $200 between the four of us, we weren't impressed. Meat doesn't fall off the bones. Extremely unsatisfied. The table adjacent to us was also telling us how disappointed they were. Will not be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time at the Big Crow and we really enjoyed it.  We did not have a reservation but after some juggling they were able to accommodate our party of five.  We had several servers attend to us throughout our meal and they were all very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy. Sort of like a log cabin with a big smokehouse fire at the back.   The food is delicious and very well presented but the servings are small. Mac and cheese is delicious and so were the ribs.  The ribs do not have sauce on them but were so flavourful.  Corn bread was good but I prefer just plain old corn bread.  This one had a creamy topping and a red sauce on the plate which together was a little overwhelming.  Nachos with brisket was great. Garlic bread was very garlicky but we loved it.  The best part of the meal, however, was dessert.  The warm s'mores cake is perfection.  The homemade marshmallow topping is flambéed overtop of graham cake with a delicious chocolate sauce.  The cake is caramelized on the bottom and is nothing short of mind blowing.    I have given only four stars because I found it to be very expensive for the portion sizes.  The garlic bread was $14 and we needed two of them.  A full rack of ribs was a cool $39. With tip our bill came to $185 for more of a sampling than a meal with only one dessert to share between us and 1 alcoholic beverage.  I will say that the quality of food is excellent.....I just wanted more on my plate!!    On our way out, the person who sat us thanked us very much for coming in and had hoped we enjoyed everything.  We did and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Never mind the food, the hospitality and atmosphere is some of the finest I've ever experienced. The food is superb, especially the salmon tartare and ribs. My god. The music is a serving of genuine good times. Such a tremendous experience."}
{"text":"First experience at Big Crow was for their weekend brunch. Enjoyed it immensly, the plates were plentiful and the staff extremly friendly. Will definitely go back and bring friends next time!"}
{"text":"Big Crow offers one of the most unique dining experiences in the city. Tucked behind the Rose and Sons diner, Big Crow is nestled in a small shed at the end of a dark alleyway. Upon entering, the place has a warm, cabin-like atmosphere - marked by log benches, heavy wood tables, and a cozy feel.   We ordered the mac-n-cheese ($11) to start. It was clear that Big Crow's chef likes to keep things interesting, putting a small twist on traditional classics. The mac-n-cheese itself was more of a cream sauce macaroni pasta, as it was lacking some stick. The bread crumbs and parsley sprinkled on top added a nice touch.   As a main, we shared the baby back ribs ($39), chicken drums ($16), hunter's sausage ($16), and a side of potato salad ($6).  The ribs were smoked to perfection. The cherry tomato and basil pesto toppings were interesting. Not my first choice for rib seasoning, but it was a nice change from the standard BBQ.   Chicken drums were spectacular. The Alabama style white BBQ sauce drizzled on top added a tangy finish.   The hunters sausage platter with sauerkraut and dijon was perfect for sharing. This is the right dish to pick if you're a sausage lover.   Oh ya - the potato salad was also delicious :)   We finished off with the sticky toffee pudding and it may have been the best dish of the night. Perfect way to end the meal.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in other reviews, I myself had some difficulty finding an entrance to this restaurant but once you enter, the place looks really warm and cozy.   Personally, I was not a fan of the dishes that were served. I feel like those who loved SMOKED dishes would like it very much but as a person who does not love the smokiness and strong fragrance food, I did not enjoy it too much.   Also the portions were really small for the price it was offered for, my friends and I ended up going for ramen after lol."}
{"text":"Reviews made us visit this place after shopping around Cumberland/Bloor West.   First of all I was quite disappointed with the service. Yes, we did not make a reservation but it was a Monday night and we didn't think it would be busy. The hostess/waitress and I did not start off on a good foot. I felt a little annoyance from her that we came to the restaurant without reservation. Our server/hostess took our order once we were finally seated, but never followed up how our dinner was. We had a difficult time getting our server's attention throughout our stay at this restaurant. I would understand if it was crazy busy but it wasn't for a Monday night. We had another waiter get us our water, condiments and finally our bill.   Secondly the food was disappointing. My bf and I ordered the popular ribs and was very disappointed. The ribs were very dry and burnt and could not really enjoy the flavour. One end of the ribs was not as dry as the other end but for the cost we were not impressed. There was a bit of a weird gassy aftertaste as well. We also ordered the beans and coleslaw. We were weirded out by the cheap hotdog pieces in the beans. Our 2nd side (coleslaw) we ordered never came.   Sadly wouldn't try this place again. Very trendy spot. And we fell for it."}
{"text":"A fun place to party. Big Crow is a BBQ lover's dream come true. Now that warmer weather was upon us, I was really in the mood for some good ole backyard barbecue eating and I was not disappointed. Picnic tables under a tent-like canopy, the smell of smokey charred meat, the plastic plates and paper napkins and the the occasional train rumbling by all remind you of one of the things we love most about summer - eating outside.   The food was really good. Lots of bold flavour. Our party of six shared jerk wings, pesto ribs, spicy broccoli, and cheesy garlic bread plus some amazing brownies in honour of the birthday girl. There's a good selection of beer and some interesting cocktails to try. We got a pitcher of sangria for the three girls to share. It was barely enough for three small glasses and mostly ice. That was my only complaint. Not that the pitcher was not much bigger than a beer mug, but that our waitress did not clue us in to that when we ordered it. Nor did she tell us that the order of wings was 5 wings and we were six people. No biggie, we just ordered more wings. But I do appreciate it whenever the staff gives a little input where needed.   I was already full before I got to try a few of the other dishes people have been raving about so I will definitely have to go back. Just remember that they only do cash or debit."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything about it - the food is amazing and the ambience is so cozy (it's a heated cabin with picnic tables, also a bit hidden). Came here for a work Christmas party yesterday and the food was delicious. I don't say this often either! We were fortunate to try a bit of everything as we ordered tons of dishes. The rainbow trout was superb and cooked perfectly, I would definitely get that again. The baby back ribs were to die for. The chinatown miami ribs were awesome too. The only thing that could have improved was the service - every time our server brought us a dish she told us what it was very quickly and quietly. I'll definitely come here again though!"}
{"text":"Another cool looking joint with really nice staff ,overpriced warm wine  and burnt brine soaked BBQ"}
{"text":"It's like a hidden gem! It is behind the Rose and sons restaurant in Dupont. A narrow entrance at the side of the restaurant. A very unique restaurant, nice ambience, friendly staff. I love their trout and their baby back ribs!!"}
{"text":"Diced pear and pesto with ribs. Not traditional but these guys do seem to do bbq right. I was there for brunch oddly enough and I tried the ribs. Thought it was excellent. We also shared the nachos with beef brisket (which came with a runny egg and guacamole). The brisket was fatty and tender, which I found lacking in most bbq joints in TO. My friend had the grilled mozzarella sandwich which she said was quite good as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The waiter was a wee bit hard on the upsell and the prices seem high for sitting out in a backyard shed - but the food was good and we were decently sated for the money.  The corn bread was solid, but the chicken was really good: sour pickled brined chicken with salsa verde.  One of the juiciest birds I've had in a while."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, waiter was very attentive. I loved the princess mimosa! I was afraid the cornbread would be too spicy but it was delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with a friend. It was not a full house but we were happy that we had extra space to catch up over good brunch. Caesar was good, I would ask to see if they can make it spicy next time. I went healthier with a crunch fried egg tostada with chorizo Verde that was yummy throughout. Will go back for dinner another time."}
{"text":"i had my birthday party here in february with a group of 12. bottom line: it was amazing. aside from the fantastic food, the venue was really cool and the service was great. all the food was served on time and in good order.   if you're organizing an event, make reservations well in advance and figure out a menu early. we made a set menu with enough options for everybody and it worked out really well. the staff was very flexible and easy to work with.  one word of caution: you will smell like delicious food and campfire smoke at the end. i wanted to eat my shirt."}
{"text":"Second time by big crow, last was in the middle of the summer, this time a couple weeks ago. It wasnt cold in there at all for a guy like me, but I saw people eating with their jackets on. Easily remedied by a blanket and some bevvies imo. Very nice and inviting covered patio.   Started off with some pickles which in my opinion were meh, the sour pickle, peppers and slaw was good, but the quick pickle was just a cucumber rubbed in brine imo. Not worth it quality wise for the price. Shared the kraut and potatoes which was just luke warm flavourless sauerkraut spiked with mustard seed served over two split pieces of cold boiled fingerling potato, didnt taste any fennel. Nothing special. The stars of the show were the grilled flank steak and 1/2 rabbit. I expected more heat from the sauce served with the rabbit, it was more buttery and sweet than hot, but went great with the perfectly cooked meat. Perfectly cooked mid rare flank topped with some mushrooms and a nicely seasoned herb and butter sauce. Wanted to have the pickerel app, but unfortunately they didnt have it, my fault for going to a restaurant on a monday night I guess.   Service was just what we needed, attentive but not in our face, never let the drinks run dry, let us know the drink and food specials up front, and bought me a shot at the end of it all. Great service. Heard rumblings of some menu changes, might be back when that happens. All in all nice experience on a monday night outdoors in the middle of winter :)"}
{"text":"After hearing excellent reviews from their other restaurant Rose & Sons, our party of 8 decide to come here for brunch today.  The menu was very limited and a lot of the flavour profiles are too sweet for a brunch. Our table had everyone order every item from the menu, so I had a pretty good idea of the outcome. While the garlic bread with fried egg and apricots was very tasty, I found the other items wasn't special enough to warrant the trek all the way up to Dupont when there are so many other superior choices of brunch in Toronto.  My biggest gripe was the service and the issue with my order. We were 1 of 2 tables that were occupying this restaurant at 11am. After waiting close to 20 minutes, I noticed my order did not arrive yet (BBQ Bacon and 3 fried eggs). This was very odd considering my extra side of bacons had already arrived.  Had the server who was very nice made a simple check in and asked \"how is everyone's food\", she would have noticed my food never came. Worst off, I was the ONLY person with a huge empty spot on the table with no food.  I eventually followed up with our server after 20 minutes and I see her conduct her due diligence. It looks like she did record my order on her paper notepad and the order did transfer correctly into their POS system. However, it looks like the chef did not prepare my order and rushed it. None of this was ever communicate to me, I was just told it was coming up. No apologies really. Under such a situation, I would expect a small gesture such as compensating me with a free cup of coffee, something insignificant to show a token of my patience and repeat visit.  It's also worth noting that she really up sold my group and made us order more coffee than required. They offer coffee in your standard cup or a French press that has 3-4 cups. She up sold our table to have 3 French presses when only 4-5 people were drinking coffee. We basically spent $30 for coffee with lots of coffee left to waste as we had about 12 servings delivered to our table.  Naturally this was our first visit and we expected her recommendation would fit the need of the table. I always find it inexcusable for service mistakes when the place isn't busy.  I think given the brunch choices of La Societe, Origin, Mildred's Temple to name a few, I wouldn't venture all the way up there for this type of service and food. My girlfriend and I spent $64 after tips/taxes for our brunch which most would agree was way too pricey."}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly staff. Awesome beer list. The pork belly alone is worth the visit. Nice and cozy in the winter, and a great patio in the summer. If you're sitting inside and plan to go somewhere else afterward, expect to smell a bit smoky. The price of admission to this great place."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere!  Best Garlic bread and Caesar salad I ever had!  Great venue for private parties or just hanging out with friends!  Highly recommend ed!"}
{"text":"What a treat this place was.  Tucked away behind a gas station the smell of campfire drew me in.  Most things are cooked over an open hard wood flame.  I had the ceasar salad (best in the city), ribs and chicken.  Everything was great.  the chicken was a real shocker.  Super moist and very tasty.  I loved it."}
{"text":"If you want AMERICAN style food go here. The food was out of this world, they made their own creations and I loved it. This place gets busy during the weekends so if you have time in the week make your way down there. The food is high in fat but it's always good to have a cheat day every once in a while. Go with a group if you can so you can experience dif types of foods!"}
{"text":"There are no words to describe this place. No words. It is so good. Just come here immediately and bask in the glory of the greatest BBQ hole in the wall joint north of Texas.  Don't mess with Texas, or the Big Crow."}
{"text":"I went here a while back with some friends of mine. the ambience is so great! Even in the cold, we were warm under the blankets, and warmed further by the fire from the barbecue. The food was great, especially  the bacon! I have to just mention that the chicken was a tad salty, but barbecue can be like that sometimes.  I would definitely go back, big crowd or small, there's something for everyone (as long as you eat some sort of meat)."}
{"text":"Won't be back Service 1 star-  prickly bearded blonde hipster dude,  who was not interested in serving and couldn't serve. Poured our cocktail in to a water glass  2 star drinks-  tasty cocktails but light on the booze. 2 star pricing.  20-30% overpriced for  what you get serving and taste. 4 star food-  tasty but I've had better. Too much sauce hides meat quality. Recommended items. The bacon and ribs. 4 star ambience. Good music and crowd. I like being outdoors with blankets and heaters. 2.6 stars"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for the vibe and atmosphere alone!!! Super cool place on a cold winter night. It feels like you are in a chalet or log cabin with plenty of heaters to keep you warm and cozy. The staff were friendly and had fun recommending dishes and definitely added to the experience. The food was pricey but plentiful. We all had the baby back ribs with delicious sides that included Caesar salad, grits, and thick slabs of BBQ bacon and maple cream onions. Well worth the price if you consider that you are paying for a fun, unique dining experience. We also all left with lunch for tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"We always bring our friends from out of town here. I love going in the winter when it's cozy, can highly recommend the smoked trout and the smoked mozzarella garlic bread"}
{"text":"We live in neighbourhood and my wife and friend have wanted to try this place for some time. Food was good but not spectacular, overpriced for quantity   you get. Full  rack of ribs ($39, a little dry, not huge) and only 5 wings ( $16 but good ), beans ($6 good with chunks of pork) , cole slaw(6), 3 beers came to $ 101.00 without tip. Steamwhistle draft, 7.50!  We were still hungry so walked down to Bloor and shared a pizza. Service good and staff helpful."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a hot summer day. We couldn't get seats for Rose and Sons as we would have to wait 30 min, so we just went to this one. Its the cutest little backyard restaurant I have ever been to.   BBQ brunch is also really cool because they have an open kitchen. The servers were very nice and the host incredibly kind man.   I will definitely rave about their coffee. That French press holds magic. Its coffee that taste so much better than your regular coffee shops. But!! We had 4 people share one coffee press which was not enough :)  Their pork chops with peanut butter and jelly was memorable as the pork chop was soft as ever and so tender to the taste. Very good mix of different flavours too. We ordered the cornbread, the banana bread and also the brie with greens item. They were all delicious"}
{"text":"It seems to me that hipsterland keeps trying to do what it does best : sell overpriced and overhyped food.   We got 1) the half slab ribs (for a whopping 20 bucks) and aside of them being small (a bag of cheetos is more filling), burned and with a very \"meh\" pesto sauce, it is the most uninspired dish you could have, 2) the most overpriced SLICE of corn bread, which for 14 dollars, I have to say I do qualify this as the most expensive \"starter\" in town and, 3) the fish tacos, which they state they are for two, which is not true as they bring you a small fish (which also tasted like it was frozen before) with some bad corn tortillas. Not only this, our waiter was quite arrogant. The only good part of this is the actual place which is quite nice. Anyway, just follow advice on one of the earlier reviews, where they say that if you want to make someone that you hate a lot pay for your meal, come here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love everything about Big Crow. From the history of how it was physically made, to the rustic food they serve and to their style.   Yes i agree it's quite hipster, but I do love the food. I miss their octopus but hey, life isn't fair."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the juiciest, most succulent ribs, you've come to the right place!! For starters, my friend and I ordered the mozzarella bread and the cheese was melting perfectly! (we also asked for chilli sauce and they accommodated!)  For the main course, we tried the baby back ribs, miami ribs and chicken wings  The great: RIBS RIBS RIBS! Baby back ribs were the best item on the main course menu for us!  The almost-great: The Miami ribs were also fantastic, but they take on a kalbi-type taste due to the way they've been sliced. Still fantastic, but nothing could compete with the baby back!  The average: The chicken wings were all right - not the best I've had (the server recommended the hen! We should have listened)  Dessert: We shared a sticky toffee cake thing (i don't remember the name).  IT WAS LITERALLY A BITE OF HEAVEN  A special shoutout to our server Olivia who was so friendly, and helped us with great recommendations!"}
{"text":"This is an outdoor eating experience where you share seating at picnic tables.  If it's really hot outside it's best to be seated away from the heat of the BBQ.  The ribs are not sauced but the flavour was good.  The wings were tasty but overpriced for the portion size.  The sides were ok - we had the potato salad and the beans.  It's behind Rose and Sons at the back of the narrow lane way."}
{"text":"So much deliciousness comes out of their wood fired grill. Try the Roasted Mozzarella Sandwich. For brunch, also get a jug of their French press - trust me, I'm a Seattleite and was pleasantly surprised by this coffee :)  The Caesar drink (with bacon!) is very interesting too."}
{"text":"I had a dinner here for a large party & it was perfect.  It takes a minute to get the swing of ordering portions intended to be shared... food is *wonderful* - FYI the caesar salad might seem like a boring order but it's one of the best I've had. The $130 60oz steak was a little lighter than 60oz but still good.  Ambiance is fantastic, music not too loud, perfect place for a group of people.  Only losing a star because our server was a little out to lunch (forgot orders, difficult to track down)"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. Unfortunately, I do not have any pictures since I came here during 9-10pm for a late dinner. The place is a bit hard to find since you have to take a narrow path to get in. I was getting annoyed since I kept missing the entrance. It was such a tease especially when I could smell the charcoal and food being grilled. What I love about this place is the patio style dinner. It is the best feeling to enjoy the fresh air and feast on delicious BBQ with your friends.   We had a big group and ordered a lot. The ones that stood out were the Perth Pork Belly, Baby Back Ribs and J.W Bird. All three dishes were delicious. My favorite was the Perth Pork Belly by far. It just melts in your mouth and you just want more! The two dishes that I did not feel were great were the BBQ Chopped Pork and Smoked Country Beef Verschi. I really did not like the taste of the BBQ Chopped Pork and the Smoked Country Beef Verschi was too salty for my taste.   The drinks here are very good and worth looking into (4/5). To be honest, I had no idea what my friend ordered but she was really good at it!  Overall, I really enjoyed the place. I would give it a solid 4.5 and definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really like the ambience in this casual restaurant. The smell of wooden oven brings back the memory of cottage life in childhood! The round eye steak tastes like heaven and the baby back rib is beyond this world! Make sure to order pickles that goes really well with both."}
{"text":"Expect to be affordable by the look of their interior and branding but actually really expansive. I don't mind paying top dollar for really tasty meal but it wasn't the case. The food was good but definitely not the best bbq in town. The meat is often dry and salty. Their garlic bread came to be 15! Again its nothing special not worth the price. It may look like friendly hipster style management but the servers act as upscale restaurant. We got there early and the whole restaurant was empty. The server made us stood at door long and pretended to there will be no seating due to many reservations. It came not to be true. I hate when they do that. Just make it reservation only restaurant then. Again fake hipster thing very misleading. Food is ok. Price way to expensive. (2 meat dish 2 sides with 2 beer for two people came 80 dollars) its a hype!"}
{"text":"Ate here on business this week. As a vegetarian going to a BBQ place, I did some quick research before agreeing to go. I was misled (not their fault) by another review elsewhere that they have a vegetarian menu. They don't. So this review is only to try and manage expectations for others.   The veggie options are the sides, which consisted of broccoli covered in cheese, potatoe salad, kimchi and a bag of chips (yes, an actual personal sized bag of chips). If you have diary issues, and don't eat meat, don't go here. They said they're expanding their vegetarian options in the weeks to come, so it might get better. However, the seat backs will likely still be made of cow hide, so there is that...  Also, if you're an environmentalist, the poorly insulated, propane heated, basically open to the out-doors space (ala Hemmingway's rooftop patio) will also likely offend.   The rest of our group had a fantastic time. So if you love BBQ, apparently this place is pretty good. Just not for 5% of the population."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch, The restaurant is hidden away in the back and is actually a really cool \"sort of outside setup\" They do good barbecue here so you should be a fan of meat. The competition style ribs are delicious a solid 8.5/10. The Rueben is amazing albeit messy. They serve good beer and cocktails (I had the Root Beer and Bourbon). Even the sweet stuff the serve is great. The only thing I could advise is if you want eggs over easy for brunch, order them as over medium. I think I've eaten almost everything on the menu at one time, at least the brunch menu. Its BBQ meat delciousness"}
{"text":"Went here after enjoying the food at its hipster sister \"Rose and Sons\". Here the service was rude, pretentious and totally hipster BUT better than R & S. So off to a good start. Went on a cold wintery morning for brunch. Got the BBQ bacon, eggs and broccolini. BBQ bacon was fucking unreal almost candied, thick and innovative. Eggs were perfectly runny. Broccolini was brilliantly done with a delicious vinaigrette. Mixing the 3 was crazy good.  Were seated right by the door... It was cold. but that only added to the cool motif. Wintery generic (Hudsons bay-esque) blankets on the benches. Felt like a camp site. Great scene we left smelling like campfire (my friends thought this is shitty, i thought it was dope). Everything is thought out. The water vases are re-done to look old and generic. Really cool little spot.   Wedged between a gas station and a place whose sign just says \"food\" and the waiters just say \"food\" when they serve you."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Big Crow and went out of my way to try it out. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the ribs. They were extremely dry and tough. The potato salad wasn't any better. Bland and nothing special. Service was good though, and I lov the cozy space with the smell of campfire."}
{"text":"It was a very neat little gem that was nested behind two restaurants!  It was neat to see the barnyard rustic theme in the restaurant and everyone was very friendly. I was excited to try everything on the menu but we have decided on ribs and flank steak with corn bread to start.  The ribs were a little too dry but the steak and corn bread was spot on! I'd definitely want to go back in the summer when the roof is open!"}
{"text":"Big Crow is tucked behind Rose and Sons restaurant. Just follow the big sign FOOD and walk around the side of the building to the back. Use your nose and follow the sweet scent of smokey meat.   Yes, the prices are a bit steep but the portions are large. A full rack of ribs plus one side was enough for 2 people. But if you are super hungry or want to splurge, get more by all means. Without drinks, the bill ended up being $75 with tax and tip---yeah, not cheap!  The ribs were nice and flavourful but I still think Barque is better! Sorry! Our Cesar salad was good too, but nothing special. FYI l: I saw the server bring the \"pitcher\" of sangria to another table and it was super small, nearly baby-sized and appropriate for only 2 people, maybe.  Overall 4 stars for atmosphere, very rustic, and summery. Good but not amazing food. Extremely pricy. More of a splurge one time BBQ place than a regular favourite. Worth a try though."}
{"text":"I just dined at Big Crow this evening with 6 people. The food was perfect. Our server, Ryan, was absolutely fantastic. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails, and guided us (who were first time diners) for the perfect amount of food for sharing. Most importantly, was his presence and personality. Made us all feel welcomed and comfortable, went the extra mile, and made us laugh. His personality perfectly fit the atmosphere. One of the best dining experiences I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Cool like place at the back of Rose & Sons. The atmosphere is certainly A+. If you looking for an original restaurant, look no further than Big Crow. Located in a barn like setting, Big Crow gives you the feel of being in a classic French Canadian sugar shack.   A lot of reviews complain about the price point, but you shouldn't listen to stingy hipsters. They have a set menu for 35$ which includes: 2 appetizers (salad and cheese bread), 1 main course (ribs, chicken, and few others I forgot), plus a small dessert. They also recently added Mac & Cheese to the menu. You shouldn't worry, for 35$ you'll be full."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Big Crow (@bigcrowbbq) this past Sunday for brunch. Located just behind Rose and Son, it's very easy to miss. No idea what took me so long since I have been fan of Anthony Rose other 2 restaurants (here &amp; here)  The weather was so nice and sunny, wished they had their rooftop open. Love the semi open space with the long communal picnic tables, I was surprise the kitchen was rather small and open where you can see all the meat being grilled.  Cowboy Coffee $10 ~ Strong French Press style coffee in my fave Le Creuset color   Fried Egg Toastada $14 ~ guacamole, charred mushroom &amp; black bean salsa, pepitas &amp; queso ~ When ordering, we were recommended this since the other two dishes was heavy meat one and we were told that it's a rather popular new addition to their menu. ~  Let just say it tasted as good as it look, very light and flavorful, didn't even miss the meat here. Perfect for vegetarian at a BBQ with friends   Baby Back Ribs $17 for half slab ~ burst cherry tomato &amp; basil pesto ~ There weren't fall off the bone tender but were not too chewy and perfectly moist.  ~ The ribs had a really nice flavor on their own but love the touch of pesto with the pop of tartness from the tomato.  Chopped BBQ Pork $16 ~ buttermilk potato salad, ezell's sweet slaw, pickles &amp; toast ~ I originally thought it would be some kind of pulled pork but it was more like chucks and wasn't drench in BBQ sauce which wasn't needed since it was so flavorful just on it's own.... wish it came with more than one slice of bread.  Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Ice Cream Sandwich $7 ~ I never would have thought that I would like my ice cream sandwich in a bun instead of cookies but this work so perfectly, the brioche bun was light and airy which make it not that filling which is perfect after all the meat we had.  ~ The blueberry sauce and the runny peanut butter was amazingly delicious (btw, where can I get that PB?!)   Verdict: ~ Large portion make it perfect for sharing! ~ Love both the space and would love to come back at light with the lights on which I am sure will look so pretty. ~ And also try the rest of the menu like their brisket and ox tongue"}
{"text":"Interesting and flavorful take on traditional BBQ. A bit on the pricey side and smaller portions but definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing in this place, and the smells are fantastic. However when it comes to the food it's a different story. Our dinner for two ended up costing $160, and we were still so hungry when we left that we immediately stopped for a slice of pizza... which sounds crazy i realize, but this place is so far from good value that I had to give it 3 stars.  The dishes are tasty - there is no doubt, but be prepared to spend some serious money when you are here. There are no sides at all. so for $27 you get some chicken, and that's it - and it's really not enough for even 1 person."}
{"text":"My best buddy and I were nowhere near this restaurant, minding my own business drinking martinis on a patio trying to decide where to go for dinner.   A Pepper Play:  EW: I'm getting a bit hungry, and a lot tipsy. Where should we go? BB: I know where we're going. EW: Would you like to tell me? BB: No. Cheque please!  Apparently he'd seen a video showcasing their brisket earlier that day, and into a taxi we got and up to Dupont. We could smell the place before we could see it, and admittedly I had to wash my hair from their smoker when I got home, but it was all worth it.  We had their sashimi nachos, pork and beans, ribs, potato salad and some beef salami-like dish. We still have a fridge full of leftovers, and I can't wait to get home and go for round two. To pair with all of these meaty treats they have a cocktail list full of whimsy, including grown up twists on Purple Jesus and coke and red wine sangria.   Look at the photos to understand how awesome the ambiance is. Think outdoor sugar shack, only prettier."}
{"text":"Love this spot... the ribs with pesto are my fave. Daily specials have always been really nice as well."}
