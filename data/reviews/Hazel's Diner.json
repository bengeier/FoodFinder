{"text":"I rarely write five star reviews.  If I find a really good restaurant, I tend to think that there must be someplace better, so I give it four stars.  In that spirit, I'm giving Hazel's Diner two stars.  There must be someplace worse.  Hazel's Diner is old, the vinyl booths are worn, the lighting is adequate but not bright and the general ambiance is dingy.  They don't offer wifi, and they don't accept credit cards.  I didn't dare check out the bathroom but if it looks like the rest of the place...  Aside from the \"no substitutions\" breakfast special, most of the breakfast items are expensive compared to other neighbourhood breakfast spots.  When I was there (8 am on a Saturday morning), the owner (Tony Xavier) was seated up front, there was one waitress, and there were two people in the kitchen.  The staff outnumbered the patrons and I can see why.  In spite of this, I was never offered a coffee refill and received one only when I called out to the waitress.  The food was not bad but the presentation was unappetizing.  I has a \"Mexican Bennie\" which was piled on top of some so so baked beans.  The home fries were tasteless.  When I asked whether they had wifi, the waitress said, \"No.  Will that make a difference?\"  I replied, \"Yes.  I won't be back.\"  And I won't."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. Seems like a family run restaurant. High quality and they really watch how much salt they use:)"}
{"text":"Used to be my fave diner in the Yonge/Lawrence area.  Not any more for several important reasons. Unappreciative staff. Long wait.   Unappreciative Staff  1) Staff does not appreciate our business. My running group has been going there every Saturday morning for nearly 3 months. Staff still does not know our names. We can be a group of 6 sometimes. They don't like this. Make us feel like we are a nuisance because we take up too much space (more about this later). I don't get it. You have regular customers who want to come in every week but you treat them like 2nd class citizens. From what I understand the owner is not there. He's running the one at Davisville. Maybe if he was there he'd care more than the staff.  Whenever I get there before the rest of my party the lady there always makes me feel like I'm just taking up space. She always asks how long the rest of the party will be.  Not as in \"I will be back to take your order\".  As in \"I don't want to give you this table because other people are waiting\". Again, unappreciative. I'm here every week. Show a little respect.  Long Wait Even When Restaurant is Half Empty  2) Wait. It's not because they are busy. It's because their seating is stupid. 50% of customers come in parties of 2 yet they have no tables for 2. The bar height table does not count. No one wants to sit there. It's more a waiting area than proper dining table. I mentioned this to the staff and was dismissed. Gentleman with blond hair said it was \"luck of the draw\" who came. Nonsense. Every week. Without fail. Half your customers are parties of 2. Clue in for pete's sake! You need tables for 2. All your tables are for 4. They are all taken with couples. Your restaurant is half empty and people are waiting out the door.  Stupid business practice. Again if the owner was there maybe he'd care more than his staff.  At the end of the day I must say the food is good.  But it's $ and there are restaurants up and down the street.  Why would I stand in line when there are tons of spaces available. Figure out that you have a seating problem."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot we tried for the first time today and took it as take out.  Both got the Canadian omelette which was good, packed full of bacon and onions.  Not the most amazing place ever, but good."}
{"text":"Well, in any restaurant the journey of their meal starts with the demeanor of the hosts/hostess. Hazel's owner/server won me over. They r very nice, attentive to everyone. I ordered the egg Benedictine and it was really delicious. Worth every penny. I recommend it highly and will return and want to try the Mexican Benny!!!!"}
{"text":"Really love atmosphere, GREAT food and fresh-squeezed juices. I recommend!"}
{"text":"I usually have the breakfast special.  I tried the pancakes they are delicious. I came back for lunch which is even better than breakfast.  Great soups, salads and great burger.  If you like diner food it's one of best in the city."}
{"text":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised. We went around 11am on a Sunday. There were about 4 tables in front of us waiting. There was no wait list everyone just milled around in the entrance waiting for a table. This wasn't ideal, especially if you were seated @ the two table near the front as the people waiting were basically standing right beside your table, but the line moved very quickly and we were seated in less than 15min. In the summer when people could wait outside I imagine this would be less of an issue.  Once seated the booths were quite comfortable. The menu was standard and since we were only interested in breakfast I didn't really look at the second side. I ordered the Mexican one, my husband and our friend both had the Eggs Natasha. The poached eggs were great, just they way I like them - supper runny on the inside. I had fresh squeezed OJ which was also delicious. The coffee was re-filled often and this was a nice surprise given how busy the place was. The portions were enormous. I didn't even come close to finishing my meal. Oh and mine came with french fries - normally I'm not a huge fan of fries, I find them kind of soggy in dinners, but these were amazing.   I didn't see the final bill but the prices looked reasonable on the menu. Oh and they only take cash or debit. We will be going back, its a great addition to the neighbourhood, and now I'm just wondering why it took us so long to go this first time."}
{"text":"I went a couple of weekends ago with my family.  Upon walking in I was greeted with a snarky young woman who I believe should not be working in the hospitality industry.  When seated, we found our coffee cups to be dirty and a unclean table.   My daughter is celiac, so I asked our waitress for any gluten free options and if the kitchen could prepare any dishes separately from the regular menu....she responded with an eye roll and a quick response of ...Sure! ...this made me feel uneasy of the breakfast . I don't know if she was hungover from the night before but the amount of sass this little blonde brought to the morning of my families day....was not the start we were looking for.  We left without ordering and will never return Again. I hope that this young blonde haired woman is fired.  This made me so upset that I had to start a yelp account to share my experiences. Thanks for listening. .....do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Stellar service and better food. Fries are some of the best in the city. Hazel's hash takes comfort food to the next level. And all very well priced. Couldn't recommend it more."}
{"text":"No idea what God G. was talking about. Service is fantastic, very quick. Hazel's hash is stellar. Fries are incredible. Solid diner."}
{"text":"The Bedford Park neighborhood is a funny one. Family friendly, but without a lot of family restaurants. Upscale, but every Ontario-wide pizzeria chain is represented within a two-block radius from each other.  When Hazel's was going up, I got excited. Could there really be a solid diner opening up with a good all day breakfast?  Needless to say, my wife and I were amongst their first customers. Service was predictably a little shaky when the doors first opened, but inside a couple of months things were running tight with a friendly wait staff, a cheap before 11:00am breakfast special ($3.99 for toast, breakfast potatoes, a couple of eggs and bacon/sausage) and some truly delicious burgers and sandwiches.  I'm happy to report that Hazel's is the real deal.  Weekend mornings are busy, between the special and the fact that a family can go somewhere comfy and get a no-fuss meal in between shopping stops. It definitely took a little longer for the weekday/lunch crowd to take notice, though. Fine by me--watching the more entrenched denizens of the 'hood try to figure out Hazel's provided great entertainment.  I'd be eating some of their crispy fries or slurping up a killer milkshake as they'd press their noses to the windows examining the menu. It's like they'd never seen a $7 sandwich in print before.  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. The owner of Hazel's also owns Chega a few doors down the street--an upscale joint (with no sign!) that I'd have to study the menu's pricing posted on the door carefully before committing to. Maybe they just wanted to verify that it's a lunch/breakfast place.  One thing that will surprise them: the pedigree means top quality food, regardless of how the table is dressed. The ingredients are always fresh, the cooking is never sloppy. This place is consistent for all day breakfast or lunch and this neighborhood just got a whole lot more desirable still.  Something to note: over the winter, they shortened their daytime hours from 6pm to 4pm. I suspect when things warm up they'll stay open later."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Hazel's. The food is great, the service is very friendly though it can get slow when the place is packed. Then again, it's packed because the food is so good. Try the Caker. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great brunch on Saturday. Terrific size portions. Seemed like a large selection, but went for eggs. Service, taste and atmosphere were excellent. looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite breakfast/ brunch places in Toronto. Ive been here many many times, and have tried pretty much everything on the menu. Their food is different, homey, and delicious. All I can say is everything is good here, its all about what your feeling. My absolute favourite is the caker. Also the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and there was a lineup at ~ 1:30 pm. Understandably - the food was good, service was good. I love the salmon & avocado omelette. Definitely a neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"I like this place - the menu is good, the food is good and consistent.  Waitresses are efficient and kind.  They are usually pretty busy and they are actually what the eglinton strip needed!  Unfortunately they only have two high-chairs - one of which is broken.  I have been turned away multiple times because there are no chairs available for kids.  Same has happened to several friends of mine.  For goodness sake, you're a family restaurant in a residential neighborhood.  Even Big Bite Burger down the street has more high-chairs (the $20 kind from ikea, which work great), and they run predominantly a take-out business. The lack of highchairs suggests that they don't value their customers, as they would recoup the cost within a day. This may seem like a small issue, but it is problematic when you walk over with a hungry kid (or pay for parking) and are then turned away. So they lose points in my book for not being as family friendly as they should be in this neighborhood - something another reviewer below noted, as well.  If not for this issue I would have given them a perfect score."}
{"text":"As far as a diner goes, this place is excellent. Tasty food, interesting specials, comfortable atmosphere and no diner smell. Also the service was friendly and kind. Great spot with kids. Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place was delightful by all counts. The service was outstandingly good, the food was amazing, but the price was a little much for breakfast. It is a clean and modern looking diner and they serve a wide variety of breakfast options. I had the hazel hash ($14) and it was an amazing blend of meat, eggs and potatoes. The portion sizes are huge and the serving time was quick. They had freshly squeezed juices and coffee available though it has to be said the coffee was a little underwhelming. I will have to go back to try out their other menu items as it all looks delicious.   Notes: The washroom is very clean and has a cool sink!"}
{"text":"I was really put off over one silly thing but that's just the way I am. I have enjoyed breakfasts at two of their locations Yonge Street and  Mt. Pleasant just this last Wednesday when upon asking for an ice water with lemon was told by the server that they charge for the lemon. They charge 1 buck fifty or 1 buck twenty - five as since I saw RED at the word 'charge', I wasn't focused on the exact amount since no matter what the charge would be, I already knew that I would not be prepared to pay anything. However, the amount of this surcharge was so outrageous that I was more interested to hear an explanation and here it is as feeble as it was. Firstly, some customers would order lemon with ice water and proceed to make their own lemonade using the sugar at the table and when I said that they must get some very nasty customers, she was quick to defend their customer base as mostly being nice. So then she tried this one on me, a lemon can cost over a dollar and if they serve only one customer lemon that day then the rest of the lemon is tossed and they need to recover the cost by charging for a whole lemon. Enough prattle! Would have left then if I had been on my own but did not want to subject my friend that I was with, to any unnecessary inconvenience so we enjoyed a breakfast special which was very good value but with just plain tap water. But since there are other diners around that can provide a decent breakfast at a fair price and still put a slice of lemon in my iced water, Hazel's is off my list as it hard for me to imagine any diner that could not figure out a way to be able to include lemon in the ice water when requested without sounding so ridiculous when they try to justify such an exorbitant surcharge. Management should work on a better story for their servers to use on their customers rather than these excuses that are an insult to the customer's intelligence."}
{"text":"Had trouble finding the place because the place is actually called Sassy's family restaurant. Very busy but good food."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. There were a few other tables of people, but the service was very fast anyways. Food arrives at the table within minutes of placing the order and the Tuscan Omelette was fantastic.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, generous portion Enjoyed breakfast for a business meeting - egg white omelette with avocado, Smoked salmon and tomato served with strawberry spinach salad and rye toast. Would definitely return to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"I dined here today after a friend of mine told me that it was really good... big disappointment! As soon as we arrived the server greeted us and told us to sit at any table we'd like. We sat down and it wasn't busy at all however, it took our server at least 5-8 minutes to take our order. He was the only person in there but he literally had two other tables so theres no excuse.   Once we ordered it literally took over 30 minutes for us to finally get our food. During which time it started to get busy around 10 minutes after we ordered. When we finally got our food we were all very disappointed. Everything was bland, the potatoes were soggy, my omelet was steaming hot as if it was placed in the microwave. My sisters burger was burnt and the food was just overall lacking any flavor or substance.   I understand that its a diner but everything is moderately priced which means that you should be getting quality food. Anyways, we won't be going back there thats for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food ordered egg benedictine for me & Bonnies hash for my husband..both were terrific i gave it 4 out of 5 though excellent service & yummy food cause the place was hot i think the ac was broke."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch staples.  Quick efficient service.  I always have the Eggs Benny (sans meat) & with extra hollandaise...Yums!!! It's not a fancy place but the food is good & the coffee is fresh & hot.  We sometimes like to linger & we've never been rushed out.  A neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on yelp and took my gf here for Sunday brunch. Great little place, food was good and prices reasonable. Staff was pretty friendly and didn't find the place noisy as another reviewer posted."}
{"text":"This little neighbourhood gem serves classic comfort/brunch food made with a subtle gastronomic flair in an unassuming but cozy little diner featuring the friendliest of owners whose passion it is to please you and your palate.  The total experience is warm, pleasing and yummy."}
{"text":"Im sorry to be a bummer with my review. We found this place from previous reviews. Were not impressed though.   The atmosphere is OK. Very little decorations with some cheap mirrors and paintings. The room felt pretty blend. It was kind of noisy and there was a heavy smell of breakfast which we carried with us for the rest if the day! The tables are only for 4 people although a couple of tables can be attached to each other. If you are a group of 6 or more, there is a good chance not to be seated. There was only one server and we had to wait quite a bit for our coffees to be refilled.  The food was good though. Except the bacon which had the test of burnt oil.   They only accept cash and debit, which was inconvenience for us. Didn't have cash and we probably git charged 1.50 each from our banks for each transaction, as we didn't have cash on us. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"The food was really good! So, why the two stars? My dining companion asked for a slice of lemon with her water and the server refused, saying:\" We only give lemon with Perrier.\" To me, that is the ultimate in cheapness and puts this experience down as really pathetic. I mean, how much is a slice of lemon??!! I paid over $50 for our lunch, so we did spend. I think management needs to look at this. It makes the restaurant seem very uncouth!"}
{"text":"Experienced a couple pleasant mornings here - a great variety of classic hearty breakfast items and healthy alternatives. Amazing service, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab breakfast in Toronto. service was rather fast and friendly. food was delicious but the portions could've been a bit bigger for the price. we were with a group of 10. the restaurant is smaller and we were lucky to get such a big table."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Hazel's Diner this week.  I had been wanting a really good burger and had read a review that Hazel's had one. I rarely find a restaurant burger that I really like. The burger was great! Nicely charred, hand patted, 7 oz. burger. My friend also had the burger and was equally impressed! Not so good the ambience though. Wanted to sit in a booth in the back but there was no a/c and it was kind of humid that day. They had a small fan going but it wasn't enough. Sat in the front and the server was kind enough to open the big glass window/door so we got some air.  Unfortunately, the flies were many and bothersome.  Other than that - the burger was excellent! We will go again, maybe in the winter!"}
{"text":"great breakfast good food and variety you have get there early or late lol but worth it"}
{"text":"What a gem! The food was amazing, fresh and pure yum for the stomach. The service was warm and friendly. Ask for Mom's homemade hot sauce."}
{"text":"Location: Located right on Yonge, there was ample street parking.  Facility: Cozy, mom-and-pop type. It's quite small and easily over crowded. We came on Mother's Day and the wait was almost an hour. There was barely any room to wait too, so it was a little awkward standing next to people who were eating by the door.  Food Quality & Price: So much to rave about the Egg's Natasha which was executed to perfection!! Prices are very reasonable and it's a nice change of pace from the big name chains. Portions are huge, definitely split-able.  Service: Was welcoming and warm, although nothing exceptional. Water was refilled without being asked and it wasn't an absurd wait time for food.  Overall: I really enjoyed the experience and can see why people like this place a lot. If I lived closer I would probably return on a non-busy weekday. Avoid weekends and special occasions unless you want to wait an hour."}
{"text":"very nice brunch spot, warm cozy environment and nice food. we went in at around 11:15am on a saturday, no queue and had free booths, order two benedict natasha (that's egg benedict with smoked salmon and pancake instead of english muffin). we were a little bit surprised with the pancake-based benny, which turned out to be very yum!! i loved it much! we also tried to get the english muffin one, but it was not as good, a bit too toasted and crusty for benny. we would totally recommend the pancake-based ones!  a 10-min walk from Lawrence subway station, it was a rather sunny and warm day so it all came to a perfect brunch day!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Hazel's for breakfast because of the amazing reviews. We walked in and didn't have to wait long for a seat which was nice. I ordered a hot water with lemon and the eggs Natasha. I had asked if I could make substitutions and the server said np! I asked for salsa instead of hollandaise on the side, capers instead of caviar and English muffin instead of pancakes. When my order arrived I had no smoked salmon, my potatoes were cold, I had 2 fried eggs instead of poached, the salsa was smeared on the  English muffin, (not on the side) which made the English muffin incredibly soggy. They apologized and brought the smoked salmon on the side and offered to change it but I politely told them I would eat it.   When we asked for separate bills he said he was too busy to split the bills. Which i found frustrating. Then when the bill came i noticed I was charged for my substitutions (which is fine but maybe mention it) and I was charged $1.50 for my hot water with lemon! They didn't take credit and the debit machine was in the back by the kitchen and was incredibly cramped. Also there was a long line because everyone was trying to individually split their bills themselves to pay so the server ended up having to do the math anyways to make sure the amounts added up! Also the place is pretty tight so it made the whole paying situation worse!  Over all, if you aren't looking for service and just want a quick egg breakfast this place is  decent. However from my one experience I would never go back."}
{"text":"I've now been to Hazels about 4 times and have never been disappointed!!! Just had an excellent burger there! One of the best diner burgers I've ever had. The ceasar salad was average but the burger alone was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Expensive for an average food. One of few locations that doesn't accept credit card. Even though there were couple of servers, only one of them seemed to be effective and she was covering most of the tables to tend the guests. Overall very average."}
{"text":"This is a good place if you want a quick and simple breakfast. It's a classic diner...With Toronto prices of course. I had the eggs over easy, and really liked the side of potatoes. I found the burger overcooked and a bit tough...would not get that again. Pancakes seem to be a family fave when I go."}
{"text":"I have been here a small handful of times now. Each time I come here is because I am in the area, I see the good Yelp reviews, and each time I leave disappointed. For a diner, they have ok food but definitely not worth the price. We ordered the Mac and cheese and it was way too salty and swimming in a cheese sauce that was way too watery. Also, this whole fad of putting bacon on Mac and cheese is getting old but good if executed properly. This place does not. I ordered the meatloaf, which came with 1 small slice and your choice of side for $14. Lastly, as previously mention, this place doesn't take credit cards which means they should probably move to a more remote location if they feel like scamming taxes."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood spot with a cozy atmosphere. Friendly service, reasonable value, decent food - won't wow you but holds its own. Best value is the all day breakfast for 5.99 between 7 and 11."}
{"text":"First time i came eggs benny were awesome. Second time, they were the worst ive ever had. Eggs totally cooked inside and cold. Maybe different waiter i dont know.  Menu is a tad on the $ side. 12$ eggs benny Decor a little outdated and boring. So hot in the summer time. No AC."}
{"text":"For those who do not want to go through a complete review, let me start by saying I love this place.  It's the best diner I know of between Eg and Lawrence on Yonge.  Brunch is my favorite meal of the day, and Hazel's is a great way to start of the weekend.  This is a diner that has a great authentic feel to it, unlike some of the chain places.  The owner is always polite and the service is great.    I've been here a few times and liked my choices every time.  Their home fries hit the spot, with just the right amount of crispiness.  The Eggs Benedictine are my favorite.    I'd go there every weekend if it weren't for my rapidly expanding waistline!"}
{"text":"To my friend's chagrin, I ordered a lunch salad on my visit here rather than one of the all-day breakfast items.   I'm glad I did.  The nicoise salad ($14) was a huge helping with generous pieces of tuna, hearty eggs and potatoes, and fresh greens and beans. It was well-dressed (i.e. flavourful but not dripping with dressing) and hit the spot for a mid-day August bite.   The restaurant is casual and cozy. Booths were large enough to spread out in. Didn't feel crowded for a weekday lunch.  Service was prompt and efficient. We were able have lunch and conclude our lunch meeting within the hour which is always a plus when going to a sit-down restaurant mid-day.   They only take debit or cash, so come prepared."}
{"text":"horrible food,when the owner is not there what do you expect, try to bring you in with cheap sign but when you get the  bill its a surprise. way better pl,aces to eat breakfast and lunch and they only take cash. How can anyone screw up breakfast?"}
{"text":"Expect a line up at this family-run brunch spot - the ambiance definitely has a \"diner\" feel to it and the menu options offer more than the average brunch place.   My all-time favorite is the Mexican Benny - Poached eggs on corn break with chorizo sausages and smothered with beans. This is an extremely filling dish, so you've been warned! The Trucker's special is also a great option if you have a big appetite - it comes with the super fluffy mini pancakes (those are amazing).   Service is quick, but not the friendliest when they get busy. It's hard to keep a smile on under diner dash stress, so it's totally understandable. Prices are fair considering the portion sizes are pretty big! Street parking is available, but the residential side roads will have free parking if you're lucky to find a spot.   There are no patios, but I could just imagine how popular that would be if they did have one. Freshly squeezed juice is available to order and hot coffee/tea is constantly refilled to your satisfaction.   Call me a big fan! I can't wait to try out other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, love their bacon, just very pricey on the beverages _ 3 dollar tea, 5 for juice??? Hotel rates not diner _ I'll go back for the bacon and service"}
{"text":"When u call these types of places greasy spoons that is exactly what it is. Although the place is good. The food is dripping with grease. Not quiet sure why they fry with so much grease. If there was less grease in their food id rate it a 4 for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and all I can say is that the service was phenomenal the breakfast came out really fast my coffee cup stayed full, the food was good and the place was packed. If you do go here just park on the same side of the street the restaurant is on. There aren't really any crosswalks and the abundance of traffic going down that street is crazy fast!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch and got lucky because it wasn't packed. The place was clean and the waitress was friendly. We didn't have to wait too long for our food either. I got the All Day Breakfast which came with toast, bacon, eggs, and potatoes. Super greasy, but super good."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back again. Portion was relatively large and I loved the Eggs Natasha (eggs benedict on pancakes). The diner on a Good Friday morning was packed and there were some people lined up at the door. Overall, a good brunch place if you're looking for a filling, hearty meal."}
{"text":"one of the worst breakfasts I've had.   waitress and \"chef\" had no idea what over medium  egg was.   even after waiting half an hour  and showing them on my phone step by step instructions they could not do it.  what kind of breakfast place doesn't know how to do this???   not even a discount offered.  didn't offer to reheat the rest of my cold breakfast waiting for their eggs.  they insisted smashing the egg yolk and cooking it well was how \"their style\" of over medium was done, and the Internet and I were just wrong or \"style\" was different."}
{"text":"I hardly come to this area, but on a whim decided to explore a new part of town.  I'm glad I did!  I got the Eggs Natasha and it was tasty.  I liked how the mild sweetness from the pancakes complimented the rest of the dish.  A cozy and cute brunch spot that I will come back to :)"}
{"text":"This was a tough one. I was inclined to give 3 stars, but two of my breakfast mates talked me out of it.  Here's why;  My initial 3-star appraisal was based solely my the food, which was average. I had my typical \"breakfast special\", eggs over easy, home fries, toast and coffee (which was a notch above average...not great, but not bad).  As I said, all solidly average which normally relegates it to the 3-star range. However, what I was overlooking, and I usually don't, was the vibe of the place.  It was definitely a step above in decor. Sure, it has a \"diner\" breakfast, but it is nicer than most of the \"greasy spoons\" we visit. Dark wood booths, comfortable seating and very clean. Our server was great and the menu was quite diverse.  The price, on first inspection, seemed too good to be true, at 4.99 for the breakfast special (my order PLUS bacon), but this didn't include coffee, which was 2.50. So, to compare with dozens of comparable breakfast specials I've had (see list), this one was 7.49, which takes it to the high end. This would be fine, since it's definitely a \"nicer\" place, but these \"nicer\" places usually step it up a bit with a nice garnish of fruit or beans or something like that (see George St. Diner, The Senator). Many lesser places have included a couple of slices of orange, for example.  Sooo, what I'm saying is my food deserved a 3, the decor a 4, so in a perfect Yelp world, 3.5 stars.  (My friends, who were judging a fancier breakfast - Eggs Florentine - and the quality of the bacon, were firmly in the 4-star camp.)"}
{"text":"I would like to rate it a four, but overall I question whether it deserves it or not.  If you go, you must order their pancakes. They were amazing, and really carried the whole rating for me. I ordered the eggs natasha, and if it wasn't for the pancakes at the bottom if would have been a total flop!  Ambiance was nice, service was odd, place was very tight and crowded, food was served luke-warm."}
{"text":"Went to go for lunch today. Most of the street was closed ( there was a power line down) so it wasn't busy. We had a stroller with us wth a sleeping baby and two toddlers. Other strollers were already in there. The server said we couldn't come in as she wouldn't have room to work. She claimed ours was too wide ( for reference it was a Bugaboo donkey in single mode, couple of inches bigger then the uppababy I could see in there. We have both strollers so I'm very sure if this). We were discussing it at the front and she came by again and pretty rudely said, see this is what I mean, I need to use this space ( she could have just said excuse me). Pity as we live in the neighbourhood and thought this would be a good place for regular lunches after the kids football, but I can't stand this kind of poor attitude. If it had been a seriously busy day with multiple strollers fine, but this was just clearly something they need to work on in a family restaurant."}
{"text":"So this was a disappointment. Mind you the food wasn't bad nor was the service but having read the reviews I was expecting amazing food that would make me want to keep coming back. Unfortunately it wasn't, the food was okay (like most diner food), good quantity and good service. They don't take reservations so you stand in line waiting to get in, you also don't have to option to put you name down (so if you are thinking of doing that and walking around the neighbourhood.. think again).   Brown girls says, \"don't except to have your mind blown away\"."}
{"text":"This place is quaint! It really has that \"diner\" feel and loving the booth seating.  Yes, because this place is quite small, it can get quite busy. I feel like any brunch place gets packed really quickly, so don't even know how early one would come to get a seat! My friends and I came at a really good time because a table was just leaving. But, unluckily for all the people who came after us, they had to wait.  Food is great - Hazel's has your signature brunch options (eggs, pancakges, hash etc...). I had the yogurt partfait which would be their \"lightest\" option, but I shared a Hazel's hash with my husband and it was great, full, and satisfying.  Hazel's also has lunch/dinner options as well.  Great brunch place if you're in the area. Loved their coffee."}
{"text":"Breakfast at this newish, attractive eatery was uninspired, to say the least. The decor set it apart from a typical diner or greasy spoon, but the breakfast special was just about average.  The eggs were overdone, the home fries were bland and lifeless, and the brown toast was \"Wonder\"-ful. I think I remember the bacon being described as \"weird\".  The waiter was attentive and the coffee flowed freely.  If you are looking for breakfast in this general area, you'd do better 1.6 kms northeast at Mars http://www.yelp.com/biz/mars-uptown-toronto or the Sunset Grill http://www.yelp.com/biz/sunset-grill-toronto-2, on Yonge just north of Eglinton."}
{"text":"Arshawn and I came here for breakfast a few days ago for breakfast.  It's a diner and prices are low and frankly so is the quality of the food.  I don't think I'm coming back again."}
{"text":"Nice little diner with friendly staff and good portion sizes. Eggs Natasha and the Mexican Eggs Benny were both good.  The pancakes are light and fluffy. They do get quite busy after 11:30 so be prepared to wait.  As theres not much room to wait inside, you will likely be outdoors. Home fries were ok but would like it more seasoned and crispy."}
{"text":"I went in and I was surprised that there was a line up, more surprising was the half the restaurant was full with customer while the other other half of the tables where full of dirty dishes. There was only one server on duty. I can just imagine how long it would take to get served, a quick bite could turn into hours of waiting."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Was heading home and wanted setting besides hotel or airport food and searched for somewhere between markham and the airport   Parking is street level and at 9am on a Thursday was pretty busy traffic wise but we found a slot out side pretty easy.   Food was great.  Cooked fast. Nice small diner and the omelette I had was delicious and great."}
{"text":"The morning after a wedding, I was with my boyfriend looking for a solid breakfast place in the area to start our Sunday off right. I came across this place on Yelp and decided it was worth checking out because of \"The Caker\" I read about. I love being able to try places with unique menu items and this is definitely one of them! I thought it was great, lots going on, but it was a little bit too rich for me to finish. My boyfriend got an omelette which he really enjoyed. The service was excellent and the staff very friendly. If I am ever in the area again I would come back. Remember they only accept Cash and Debit at this time :)"}
{"text":"Excellent little diner for brunch.  Great place for my post workout meal.  The Trucker Special: 2 pancakes,  3 eggs, 2 sausages,  2 pieces of bacon, toast, potatoe hash, baked beans....it was a pretty awesome brunch meal!  I would even say it was epic.  The baked beans was the cherry on top and I could barely finish it.  We got there just before a line up formed outside.  Even if you had to wait a bit, it's worth it. I'll definitely come back again.  They had other non breakfast type foods on the menu but the breakfasts is what you come for. Take a stroll and have some brunch!"}
{"text":"Shared the Loaded Waffles + Poutine =$18 and we were both full before finishing the meal :)  The server was so friendly! You can tell she actually cares about service and the restaurant.  Only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because the poutine had kind of a weird gravy (maybe chicken idk) and not fresh cut fries. The waffle was good though, lots of fruit toppings."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS Nothing spectacular about the hollandaise & omelette which was over done. Very reproducible at home. Service was above average, friendly & attentive but I was the only customer on a late Sunday afternoon. I would rather go out of my way to eat at Under the Table than here.  Food is not special enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! I've been here a few times now and they never let me down! The owner is friendly and always in a good mood.   The food is great, I only tried their breakfast dishes but I'm. Sure the rest of the good is also good... It looks good!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, a classic little breakfast diner with a nice menu of breakfast and brunch items with nice twists. My personal favourite and a bit of an addiction is the eggs Natasha, basically a smoked salmon eggs Benedict on tiny pancakes with black caviar, it's amazing. The staff here is always friendly and generally run by an older staff that is always on their game. A great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Excellent local place for breakfast (or lunch)...standard as well as eclectic breakfast menu...comfort-food type lunch menu.   Perplexingly...not open for dinner or later (makes no sense to leave the place dark after lunch...costs have already been paid for). Would also be a cute place for dinner and could also be a cool bar. One more recommendation..man-up your coffee!!! They serve only standard coffee/decaf from a depressing central bar area (with a several generation-old green iPod dangling vicariously from a similar circa amp)...a nice Italian espresso/latte machine....and a dedicated barista...would go a long way...not to mention, obviate the need for the long-suffering, overrun servers...having to make drinks/coffees...in addition to serving, busing, cleaning, etc. Oh my God...spend a little...gain a lot!!"}
{"text":"I have tried many different brunch places in the city, and this one is my favorite. Perhaps not the fanciest of all, with the beautiful design, etc, but for sure the best choice food wise. One important factor is the portion sizes and quality with respect tot the price. So best bang for your buck I think."}
{"text":"Since the owner swiched hands (now Sassy's) this place has tanked. Small portions, undercooked and the food is anything but fresh. All of which has doubled in price! 3 bucks for a damn Tea! Avoid this place like the plague. At least the service was good."}
{"text":"Truckers breakfast (all day) at 12$ can't be beat! The food is super fresh, hot, delicious in every way! I love this little mid town spot , only reason it's a 4* is that it lacks some fresh fruit or any thing that looks like it still has life to it, just a slice of an orange or a cantaloupe and it would be a perfect 5* other then that no complaints, does get busy on the weekends so expect a little wait! And parking isn't free but you can park on the street for  2.25$ an hour. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"TL;DR Cozy atmosphere, love the decor and lighting, service is very very friendly, the food is pay what you get for and perfect to have brunch dates. Friendly neighbourhood and family vibes going on.  This experience was a little awkward for me mostly because me and my friend weren't sure if we should have waited to be seated or just sit down anywhere we liked because the waiter was no where to be found.  It was okay after we invited ourself to seat oursellves at the taller tables by the and the waiter seemed inviting and also as though guests who seat themselves in is a normal thing.  My friend ordered the all day breakfast with sunny side up eggs and they said the dish was a STEAL and well worth the price with its quality.  I ordered the Natasha's and because they used pancakes it was such a sweet twist that I loved it so much. I really enjoyed their pancakes, but I'm not gunna lie, I've had better pancakes and these are pretty mom friendly made at best. Not a bad thing because it was very nostalgic of the premade pancake batter my mom used to make pancakes back in the day.  The caviar and smoked salmon were nothing too special or crazy to say it was amazing but a very good meal for the price. Loved the poached eggs very muchand the hollandaise was perfect.  I really love their coffee as FOR ME it was not too watery nor was it too strong in coffee beans. A perfect homey brew for a smooth wake up call in the morning.  The potatoes were done nicely, but like I said nothing too spectacular to go crazy for.   I mostly enjoyed the atmosphere this place had and the nostalgic food that brings me back into the times of my childhood which is why I gave this place 4 instead of 3 when most of my reviews are very food based and service picky.  Thank you for having me I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying this place. everything was great. the food, the service was excellent. their fresh orange juice was awesome. it was a bit hot inside the diner but  that didn't stop us finishing our food and coffee. thanks again Hazel's diner."}
{"text":"Decent place for a weekend brunch. As other reviewers have pointed out it can get busy pretty quickly. We got there around 11am and still had to wait a good 20 minutes. No big deal although if the weather was colder it wouldn't be so nice waiting outside for a table.   It seems as if their eggs Benedict is a really popular choice. I went for the truckers special which is a little bit if everything: pancakes, 3 eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and baked beans. The baked beans were too sweet but everything else was quite tasty. They don't allow any substitutions. They also have fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice. This place is a bit pricey for breakfast.   Service was pretty good. The diner itself is a bit divey. It didn't exactly feel that clean. Overall an ok place but I wouldn't make a special trip out here just to eat here."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday morning with 3 friends. Service is good, pancake is quite delicious!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I had eggs florentine which were delicious as were the home fries that came with it. My two young nieces had waffles (covered in whipped cream and fruit) and the plain jane burger both of which were well received.   The service was great and I really liked the atmosphere. Excellent place. I've no reason to come down to this part of town very often, but I would come back specifically to eat brunch at Hazels."}
{"text":"Expensive for mediocre breakfast food. Mediocre service. Would not recommend. I'll stick to my usual breakfast spots or even Boom as a last resort..."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place can get busy easily.  Friendly staffs... this is our secons time back again for the Natasha benedicts, love they use the mini pancake instead of breakfast muffin."}
{"text":"Dishes were not clean. Eggs had the 'egg smell'. Overall a cozy and nice environment but owners can do better in term of food and service quality."}
{"text":"amazing breakfast/brunch place, easy access, free parking infront , on sunday before 1pm.  great services,  food was unbelievable good. huge portion for the price.  100% satisfied. will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with wifey last Sunday. We were in earlier than I would expect the crowd to be there so it wasn't too busy, the place is on the smaller side though so beware when going on weekend brunch rush hours. The service was great, they always made sure we had enough coffee, which wasn't bad as well, a lot better than what I expected it to be coming from a diner. The food was great, I had the Mexican Benny and my wife had the Eggs Benedictine both of which were great. Also got to try their house hot sauce which was really good, not too far on the hot side. Would definitely recommend as a great local brunch place."}
{"text":"I was craving some yummy breakfast the other day and came across this place by looking at the many Yelp reviews.  My fellow Yelpers did not let me down! Hazels has  home cooked feel and there was a line up when I went. After a short 10 minute wait I ordered the Eggs Natasha with salad. It was delicious! The portions are massive and the sides I got were scrumptious as well!    If you are looking for a great brunch/breakfast place then this place is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a small but busy diner in Toronto that has good service but just average food. They specialize in breakfast and have the usual items like Eggs and bacon, French a Toast, Waffles, and Pancakes."}
{"text":"Nice traditional diner. All day breakfast is fabulous. I had a Cobb salad which was great. The place is small and can fill up quickly but service is lightning fast and they turn over tables quickly. A great find on uptown Yonge St."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend. We found this place from Yelp and it surely did not disappoint. We arrived just before 12 before the rush hit and waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. The restaurant was packed but the service was very friendly and efficient. My boyfriend and I ordered an eggs benedict meal and a side order of bacon and sausage...both were delicious. Portions were massive and cooked to perfection. It was a family owned business so you could tell they put their heart into it. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many a breakfast restaurants all have been very good and this one is just as good as all of them. The food is good, the service is good, and prices are reasonable...given the location. Only cash or debit only. Even though we had to wait (15 minutes) the entire experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"Ok, this may or may not be because of the time but that still does not excuse everything. We had brunch around 12:30pm. The place was pretty empty. Roughly between 6-8 other customers in the building. First off, the waitress left the empty tables filthy with dirty plates and cups. She did not bother to clean them up because she was busy chatting it up with regulars. So immediately the place felt dirty. It took her forever to get to us, again because she was busy chatting it up with a close friend. Finally we order: a half stack, an order of french toast, 1 egg, 1 order of potatoes, a cup of coffee and orange juice. The food tasted bland, very plain and dull. I tried my best to flavor it up but it was not working. The coffee was an absolute disaster. It was horrible. The service was very poor. Yes our waitress was kind but, the place was a mess, and she was not tending to her customers as she was preoccupied talking to friends. Oh, the prices are insane! We spent $35! The coffee and orange juice came to $7.50 alone. Absolute rip off. I've had better food and service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good option for breakfast. Two tone rye bread, real potatoes, crispy bacon, 2 eggs in the breakfast special for $5.99. It's clean and bright and doesn't have the greasy spoon vibe too much."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast, inexpensive brunch. Bacon crisp, eggs perfectly cooked and fresh potatoes. Cost for the \"All Day Breakfast\" is extremely fair and well worth it!"}
{"text":"It appears that there's not too many breakfast joints that open up early close to us, so we ventured to North York for some early morning grub.  Hazel's is a typical diner with old, dated mismatched furniture with a friendly and efficient hostess/waitress that keeps your coffee cup constantly topped off (diner quality drip coffee).   Here's where it breaks the mold: a bold and creative menu that pairs different flavors that you wouldn't expect. THE BEST example was my Eggs Natasha with poached eggs, smoked salmon, on top of pancakes, covered in hollandaise, a dollop of sour cream and topped with a little bit of caviar. Oh my! I ordered this because the description peaked my interest. I was surprised and delighted that the flavors complimented each other so well: salty, sweet and savoury. I thoroughly enjoyed the pancake underneath that was light, fluffy and delicious. It came with a side of home fries that tasted decent but were too soft and missing the crispy edges that I like.  Hubby ordered the Hazel Hash: 3 eggs, potato, corn, ground chourico, onions, (bell) peppers, jalapeño served with a side of buttered Texas toast. It was alright, not very spicy at all with a pool of orange grease at the bottom of the plate.  They do need to clean up a bit with it's coffee stained menus and a few fruit flies buzzing about. Whoever renovated the wash rooms (looks newer) needs to redecorate the main dining area with some modern furnishings and splashes of color.   Would come back if I'm up for an early breakfast."}
{"text":"Hazels as 2 locations but for whatever reason I prefer this one over the one on mount pleasant. Food is very tasty. I always go with the eggs Benny and am never disappointed. Get the breakfast specials when you can  always a Excellent. What really adds to the charm of this place is the service. My girlfriend and I always talk to the owner when we go and he is nothing but smiles. Get here soon."}
{"text":"Arrived pretty late by brunch standards but there wasn't a wait. I've heard a lot about this place and I guess I was lucky to get a table with no wait (still a full house though!)  I ordered the fabled Eggs Natasha and my fiancé had the Trucker's Breakfast. So let me say I'm a notoriously slow eater and I absolutely pounced on my dish. Like inhaled the eggs like I was a starving beast. I had a few potatoes which had fried onions with them (delicious), but was absolutely stuffed. But despite feeling like I can roll out of here, I don't feel \"gross\".   The staff is busy but very attentive and kind, smiles all over...it's not easy especially if you're working like crazy. Kudos to them and the chef everything was great and tasty. Best pancakes I've had in ages!"}
{"text":"Have been driving by this place many times and decided to check it out for brunch. It was packed, but my pal and I were able to snag a booth. Hazel's is a super clean greasy spoon with menu items perfect for a weekend brunch. Service was excellent; coffee, tea, and water refills came often. Pricing is average, it's definitely not a cheap eat, but you're also not spending a fortune eating here. I had the Eggs Florentine with a Rosti ($2 extra) and a tea ($3 extra) - my bill came to $16. Food was pretty good - then again, I love eggs - can eat at any meal of the day.   Good for: breakfast, brunch"}
{"text":"I love this place.. all day breakfast is great and service is out of this world!!  my server, both visits, remembered everything about my order from the time before which was about a month prior..!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal... Had the club house sandwich -  Crispy bacon and grilled chicken. Fast service and a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really nice little diner! Quick turnaround and delcious food! Definitely want to go back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good brunch spot near Yonge and Sheppard that I could saunter over to, on laaazzzyyyy Saturday mornings. I found Hazel's Diner on Yelp (thank you Yelpers!). Everyone raved about their hearty brunch and great service. Well, they were right. I had the Mexican Benny with Chirozo topped on cornbread. It was delicious and the servings were huge. My friend had a handsome looking mushroom and mixed green salad- not something I would expect to find at a diner. I would totally go back here and would recommend it others. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp with the high ratings of this place. There was a bit of a wait for a table, and the service seems a bit on the slower side...it's a bit delayed.   We ordered the Eggs Natasha ( wasn't a huge fan) it was good don't get me wrong. However I found everything just mushy. I'm not a huge fan of the mushiness.  And my date ordered the regular eggs benny. Nothing to report there, was good.  Overall, the amount of seating available and the slowness of service you'll need to expect to wait a bit for a seat."}
{"text":"We live just down the street so we stop in for brunch a couple times a month. We've been there 3 times so far and only had to wait for a table once, and it was a 10 minute wait. We usually visit around 10am on a Saturday or Sunday.  It's a small place so there's just one server working, and she's run off her feet so the manager does the food running and helps her bus tables. Sometimes it's hard to get the server's attention if you need something, so you have to be a bit patient.  The food sometimes doesn't arrive all at the same time, but other than that we have no complaints. The food has been consistently prepared and good each time and they keep your coffee topped up well.  If they took credit card payments and were a bit more organized I'd give them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"After browsing on Yelp for a little this morning, I decided to try Hazel's Diner for breakfast. It was not very busy when I arrived (I seem to say this a lot in my Monday morning breakfast reviews!), so service was very quick, and the waitress was really perky. The restaurant has a nice look inside with dark wood trim and furniture, part of an old brick exterior wall, a half-dozen booths and three different types of lighting.  The breakfast menu is heavy on egg breakfasts, including a wide assortment of omelettes, and then the usual sandwiches and diner plates for lunch. At first I was going to choose The Caker, a pancake stuffed with eggs bacon and cheese. But then I decided to have the Mexican Benny instead, poached eggs with chipotle hollandaise sauce on chorizo sausage and a corn biscuit, with baked beans and home fries. It was a fine choice, spicy but not too much, and the sausage and beans were good. The only downside was that the corn biscuit was falling apart constantly, so it would have been easier to eat with a regular English muffin.  The bill came to $18 with coffee, so a little more than other similar places I have been, and $2.50 for the coffee is more than most. But it was still worth it for a good and different meal, and I am sure to return sometime to try The Caker. Definitely a recommendation, but note that they accept cash and debit only, no credit cards."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Hazels because the other restaurants in the are were not open.  In the future, I will wait to eat rather than go to Hazel's again.  The eggs Benedict were definitely below par with a very globy dose of hollandaise sauce.  The potatoes were average and the Americano was poor.  I would not return."}
{"text":"We were in the area, and stopped here for breakfast on sat morning. the egg benny is good, not super awesome but good. home fries - again, pretty average. hubby had the burger patty with some beans all around the egg and cheese. it was interesting. didn't taste like much and i was wondering why wouldn't they serve it with some toast at least? Everything needs more salt.   cash and debit only! people still do that these days?"}
{"text":"We've been to Hazel's twice now, as it's nearby to good friends and makes for a convenient Sunday breakfast spot.  Unfortunately, the undeniably friendly staff can't make up for average food at above average prices, or the tragic comedy that is their coffee.  So what's my gripe?  Well, our most recent experience saw:  *  Unreasonable and illogical upcharges for menu substitutions (turkey bacon is 50c more by menu price for a 3pc order, but $1.50 more for a substitution of 2pc on a breakfast).    *  Questionable quality and freshness:  the same turkey bacon, and accompanying sausage, were flavourless and cold upon arrival.    *  Three eggs according to the menu arrived as two, and an order of over medium came barely over easy.  I suppose it's easy to slip up on quantity of eggs, but at their prices it's annoying at best.  *  Previously mentioned coffee.  Words cannot describe how bad, though I'll try: I came armed with a hangover and desperate need for caffeine, which usually translates to \"I'll drink just about any coffee-type-sludge you put in front of me\".  I couldn't finish a cup.  Sour and burnt are pretty accurate descriptors and no amount of milk and sugar could rescue it.  This is a diner, people!  A breakfast diner!  Average coffee?  Sure!  Bad coffee?  Ok, I can tolerate... but perhaps the worst coffee I've ever had?  Gods, no!  Who brews your coffee, Hazel?  Tyler Durden?  So why two stars and not one?  Well, the first experience was about a 2.5, perfectly serviceable (same awful coffee, however), and the staff really are just super likable.  It's hard to give a * review to such nice people... so let's hope they improve their coffee, re-examine their price structure, and do a better job of ensuring food freshness.  They deserve better.  But then again, so too do their customers."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the Yonge & Lawrence area hands down.   Don't let the store front \"fool you\"  :) ... I always select my toppings when making an omelettes.  The food is never greasy and really good also well priced for the neighborhood.  Ok I live in the area : )  This diner also has that atmosphere where you just wanna sit and talk with your friends forever, no wonder it's called Hazel's.  Keep the coffee coming ... The pancakes are also delicious ... Rocked 5 years ago and still rocks now ...  On a sunny Sunday this place can have you wait a bit."}
{"text":"Dropped by Hazel's for a weekday lunch. Interior decor is reminiscent of a 50s greasy spoon with a combination of booths and tables.   Menu is fairly extensive with lots of combinations on the standard 'bacon an eggs' breakfast.  There's a nice variety of salads and burgers too.   I opted for the sautéed mushrooms and salad. My companions had a bacon and cheese burger combo and a smoked salmon omelette. The mushroom salad was tasty as was the burger combo. Unfortunately my other friend found the omelette to be on the bland side. Portions overall were reasonable.  Prices slightly high (but in line for the area).   Service friendly, establishment average for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Americans on vacation! The hotel breakfast just wasn't cutting it anymore. We found this place on Yelp and thought it would be exactly what we wanted. It really was. The coffee is delicious and endless and our food- omg- I had the TPA Benny and my boyfriend had the frittata omelet. SO MUCH FOOD! Service was wonderful, our waitress was very attentive and kind. Since we are American, our American debit cards don't work in this particular place, but there is a place to get cash nearby! So bring cash!!! It's easier. We will be back should we ever find ourselves here again."}
{"text":"I was excited about a new \"authentic diner\" opening in my neighbourhood. I Live near this place, have gone there a few times and always thought something was off, but couldn't quite wrap my head around it. The kitchen staff can whip up your standard breakfast bullshit that anyone with a half functioning brain can, with slow incompetent service to boot!  (having to ask for ketchup for fries,jam for toast etc). Not only do you have to ask for every single thing twice, but the food is all around average. Small portions, boring flavours, and high prices for average greasy spoon eats.  The real kicker for me was failing to mention they only take cash til' the last minute, then having the owner try and steal my wallet / hold onto it.   That's when it dawned on me that this place isn't necessarily horrible, just ran by a mean narcissistic prick who wants nothing more to than take your money and get you out the door in time for his next customer. Instead of dealing with a pretty simple customer service problem he made me and the person I was at the restaurant with feel like criminals, and ruined the entire experience forever. How anyone who owns a new restaurant could be this rude and unprofessional really beats me.  I've never been so disgusted with service or a restaurant before and I hope this place gets condemned. I also highly recommend this place for over privileged yuppies who need a place to feed their irritating loud kids, or is too lazy to cook breakfast. Since that's the vibe I got from this place.  Don't be fooled by the friendly welcome you get from the owner, this guy has some SERIOUS deep seeded issues.   Oh the interior is outdated and pretentious."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Was quite busy but staff was very attentive, offered us coffee while we waited. Tables didn't stay empty and dirty, as soon as someone left they worked as a team to have them clean and ready as fast as possible. Delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"You can order anything on the menu at breakfast. Had the BLT with salad. The bacon was nice and crisp and it went well with the rye bread I chose. Would definitely recommend. The place was practically full the time I went in the morning"}
{"text":"This is a very good place to go for breakfast. The prices are a little bit higher than I'm used to paying, but I found the food to be tasty, creative and with just the right portions. No heaping, greasy, messy breakfasts here, only sophisticated, flavourful dishes with some flair. The coffee is good, too. It's not a huge place, and there was a lineup out the door when we left--the sign of a good restaurant.  If I hadn't found a $30 parking ticket on my windshield when I left (I was over by 7 minutes), I probably would have given Hazel's five stars. Next time."}
{"text":"This is a cute diner and an alternative to the pub brunch in my neighbourhood. The regular breakfast dish (eggs, bacon, home fries & toast) was well made and not greasy - so bonus points. The tea at $3 per pot, while the coffee is $2.50, is not though!    But it's a cute place and the meal was well cooked."}
{"text":"Yes, Hazel's is as good as they say. The service was excellent. Fast and friendly. Not rushed at all. The coffee is good.  I had a Frenchie: a delicious fluffy omelette with caramelized onions, brie and asparagus. What a great combination!! I chose the rye for my toast and was surprised at how nice it was. Fresh marble rye toasted crispy on the outside but still a little soft inside. The hash browns were pretty good, too but the omelette was definitely the star of this dish.  My hubby had the Eggs Natasha. Poached eggs with smoked salmon served on pancakes. Eggs benny with a twist. It doesn't get much better than this. A hearty breakfast. Be prepared to wait a bit on a Sunday morning. Trust me, though, it's worth it! Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for business breakfasts.  Englishman handling the tables provides quick service and food is consistent. I take the subway here as parking is not that easy unless you find a place on Yonge St.  This is a very affluent area with great networking potential.  Now taking all my musicians here for breakfast and they are loving it.  Happy New Year.  TJ"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The owner was friendly and inviting....you could tell he really appreciated our business. The breakfast special is priced very well (especially before 11am for 4.99) however the menu is a but on the pricey side for a diner. the food quality and taste, did however make up for this. its a great little place to pop into for a more gourmet style diner food experience."}
{"text":"The customer service wasn't impressive.  I ordered the caker which is a pancakes with eggs and bacon inside. It was tasty until i got turned off from the eggshells and the bacon which was mostly stringy fat"}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE the Mexican Benny at Hazel's. It's just the perfect spicy dish for brunch."}
{"text":"I was approached by the owner of this establishment following a negative online interaction with one of his staff. He handled it with integrity and honesty and I am appreciative of the way the situation was handled.   My experience here was good but the way the owner handled the situation was great. I was called bad names by his staff but he took ownership, which is a very respectful thing to do.   Given the owners response, I feel as though my needs have been met and that based on the food and the attention by the owner, this place deserves a solid 4*.   See my original review about the food. It is good. But the fact the the owner stepped in to resolve a somewhat sensitive staff member is much appreciated and very valued.   Their menu is great and you should check them out."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp on a holiday morning. Had a very pleasant surprise when the Eggs Benedict was served on top of fluffy pancakes! Delicious!! It provided the sweetness to balance out the yummy hollandaise sauce. Very friendly staff.   The only thing that would have made it a better experience was if they served tastier coffee, but I guess it would have changed the classic diner experience."}
{"text":"We were looking for a great breakfast spot and read the reviews.  Had a great meal   People were very very friendly. Will come back again when we are in Toronto.  Portions are large.  All home made. You gotta eat here.!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the far drive for breakfast. My friend found this neighbourhood gem on Yelp. The eggs benedict and eggs Natasha are my fave! Wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Ordered the famous Eggs Natasha with a side of sausage and the Smoked Salmon Rosti, both of which were pretty good, and also very creative dishes that I haven't encountered anywhere else. I'll definitely be back to try out one or two other items on the menu (the caker is up next!)."}
{"text":"Best hollandaise sauce I've tried outside of Lambton Golf Club's Chef Kieback. It's about time. I've been in search for the last 15 years and HALLELUJAH... They even put it in the salamander. 100% must try!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars The menu had a lot of variety and I wanted to try almost everything that was listed. Tried the Eggs Natasha $13 - poached eggs with smoked salmon on pancakes with home fries (4/5 stars). Eggs were poached perfectly with the yolk oozing out when punctured. Also got the Jumbo chili dog with fries $9. This was quiet the letdown. First off jumbo is more like a small and the chili was like 2 spoon fulls worth. In my mind I was picturing one of those jumbo street sausages with chili all over my fries and all over my hotdog. I was ready for a messy meal...bib and all but everything was just so neat and tidy (3/5 stars). Also got the deep fried mozzarella sticks with apple sauce as a side $7. These were basically the cheese stings that you get at groceries deep fried and the apple sauce was actually from the supermarket (Motts Fruitsations -  refer to picture). Not worth the $7 in my opinion (3/5 stars). For the money I was really expecting more but I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. A true diner feel and homey atmosphere. Friendly service and somewhat quick service since there was only 1 server. The chili dog didn't come close to filling my enormousness appetite so had to actually get more food elsewhere. Good thing Burger Priest  was right next door."}
{"text":"Come early on weekends or expect a wait time. Love love love their pancakes!!! I think I came here 3x in one week just for the pancakes once. My husband ordered their fish and chips once and enjoyed it. So I'm sure their lunch items are just as good."}
{"text":"Equal parts 50s diner and brunch restaurant, Hazel's diner is a solid 3 star. With ample amount of tables and consistent food quality, you can't go wrong with this place if you're looking for a family-friendly restaurant that doesn't try to deviate too much from the norm.  Food? Decent but nothing to write home about.  Ambiance? Noisy at times but there is definitely a positive energy.  Service? Prompt and courteous.  Truckers Special and The Caker seem to be the two most popular dishes but I honestly can't remember what they taste like. What I do remember though is having a good time every time I visit Hazel's Diner. It certainly helps that it is situated on a particularly interesting stretch of Mount Pleasant road.   I recommend: come here with a few friends or family members, enjoy a greasy but satisfying brunch and then take a walk along Mount Pleasant road to burn off some calories."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Wednesday afternoon around 3ish.. we were the only ones in the diner. It looks like a diner from back in the 1990s. Not impressed with the atmosphere or the decor, a bit dark on the inside, but we were starved and didn't care. Coffee and tea were $2.5/$3 respectively but it's complimentary refills with food purchase so it's not too bad. Coffee tasted mediocre but it wasn't burnt or anything. We got the egg benedictine (around $12) and it was very delicious. Fresh homemade chunky homefries, paired with two toasted English muffins, 2 perfectly poached eggs, 2 slices of back bacon (tastes and looks more like ham), and hollandaise sauce smothered on top. Their sausages were pretty lean and tasty too. Overall a good place for breakfast but not worth it if you don't live in this area."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast we had today at Hazel's! It's a low/key, not fancy diner with excellent service, reasonable prices and delicious food. I only found it because of Yelp ratings, so thank you fellow yelpers!  We had the all day breakfast ($7!) and the caker. The all day breakfast was solid and well priced. Now let me talk about the caker. Boy, was that a worthwhile splurge of deliciousness. This is generously sized and I found just a tiny bit of maple syrup perfect even with the egg and cheese contents. I subbed sausage for the bacon. Coffee was continually refilled.  Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Line is very long so I expected it to be pretty good. Service is very slow. We arrived at 1:30pm didn't get seated until half an hour later.  Ordered and food was sub par. Not worth the long line and slow service. Not very sanitary place. Not cheap either.  Worst part is near the end of my meal I felt pain in my stomach. I got home and had diarrhea.  The place wasn't very clean.  Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, the staff always seems to be on the ball and warm which starts the day off right. Breakfast special (before 11) is pretty solid and the restaurant itself is very clean and welcoming. Reliable spot for solo breakfast, visiting with friends, or bringing family members (have done all three multiple times). Usually the volume of people is pretty good so never really a problem getting a table or service (have heard on holidays it fills up).  Have only done the breakfast (special, omelettes, and the eggs bene) and one day will try lunch, so far so good!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on the weekend, and it was a super cozy and relatively small restaurant :)  There were several pieces of interesting artwork (and random rectangular mirrors), which gave the resto a modern feel.  Eggs Natasha - I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and not as big on pancakes, but Hazel's made it work!  There was caviar with sour cream and smoked salmon on top of the pancakes - I wasn't really feeling the sour cream and preferred the dish without. The smoked salmon was definitely on point though, and the poached eggs coated the pancakes perfectly. Mexican Benny - YUM.  I liked this more than my own dish because the chorizo sausage was deliciously spicy.  I also thought the chickpeas and cornbread were nomsworthy, would definitely get this the next time I come :)  Annnnd!  The fresh OJ was excellent, I enjoyed the pulp :3  Service was pretty quick, waiting time was only a couple minutes on what I expected to be a busy Sunday.  Worth a visit (or two)!"}
{"text":"We couldn't find the breakfast part of our bed-and-breakfast so we booked it uptown to find something closer to church. Hazel's was it. It seems out of place, being a reasonably-priced diner in a trendy part of town.  The decor is plain and comfortable, and the booth seats are a little too squishy. It was crazy busy with two (maybe three?) people working. Service was friendly and fast.   Hubby had a loaded waffle, which is really loaded up with berries and almond-flavoured whipped cream. I had... the Caker. This is a pancake wrapped around layered eggs, cheese, and bacon, and it comes with a little pitcher of syrup. I said to the waiter (who may  have been the owner/manager, I'm not sure) that I was intrigued, and he said if I loved savoury/sweet combinations I would like it. And I did. I also wasn't hungry again for about six hours.  Prices range from $4.99 for the eat-in breakfast (7-11 am) to $14 for the special chorizo hash. You can splurge or you can cheap out.   This is a great little spot in the middle of a sea of more pretentious cafes and bistros. ."}
{"text":"Four stars, but remember it IS a dinner!  NOTE:  They only take cash and debit.  They do NOT take credit!  Busy and very loud.  Not a place for conversation.  Took my elderly father there for lunch and that was a mistake due to the noise.  I had to basically yell for him to be able to hear anything I said.  On the other hand, the server was excellent.  Quick, knew the menu, friendly, and there when she was needed without being in the way.  My brother had the \"caker\".  He enjoyed it but had a hard time finishing.  Very generous portion and very heavy!  Based on another Yelp review, I asked about the smoked salmon and avocado omelet.  When I learned it was an egg white omelet I should have passed, but it was intrigued and ordered it anyway.  I personally find egg white omelets are always a bit blander than I like and I find I want a sauce or something to zest them up ... undoing any reason of not using the yolks.    The omelet was generous and plenty of fresh smoked salmon and avocado.  As advertized, but next time I would request they use whole eggs and not whites or try one of the 3-4 other menu items that caught my eye.  On the whole.  I liked the place and if I was in the area again (without my elderly father) I would return to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"3.5  Came here based on the reviews and it was everything most said it would be. A nice place to come to breakfast  Pros: Nice place for breakfast Friendly service  Cons: If you're not there early, expect to wait a while for a table Cash and debit only  We came in early on a Saturday morning.  The place was half full already.  Within 10 minutes the place was packed and there was a line up to get a table.  You need to come early or you will be waiting.  By the time we left, there were crowds of people waiting for a table.  We ordered the Trucker's Special and the Eggs Florentine.  The food came out pretty fast considering how busy they were by the time we ordered.  The portions were plentiful and for the most part, everything was good.  The bread they use for toast is very thin and was like a cracker after they toasted it.  Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else.  My GF said her eggs Benedict were OK, but she's had better.  The servers were terrific.  There were only 2 of them though.  For a place as busy as this place can get, they should really have more.  The running all over the place.  Still they managed to do an excellent job.  She came to refill the coffee and immediately realized my GF ordered a decaf.  She took the whole cup back and came out with a new cup of decaf.  I know if I was her, I would not have realized as quick.  The bill came out to $37 after taxes.  A little pricey for breakfast for 2 compared to other places. Cash and debit only can be a hamper to some.  Still a nice experience though.  Good thing we weren't one of the people outside waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"What can I say?  They can't seem to do toast.  The butter was still cold on the cold hard toast. I had a bit of the hash only to find out that it was spiked with hot sauce. No mention on the menu about that. My wife's omelet had a big piece of cold brie in the middle of it, we sent it back, the second one is better, but too late since our Two year old has a very short sitting span, left most of it on the plate... didn't even bother with the coffee.   We have had better luck with the one on Mt Pleasant. Go there if you still feel like you want to roll the dice.   What I wouldn't give for a good breakfast place around here..."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened by this place after a long run in the rain; we were ready for a greasy breakfast and that's pretty much what we got. No surprises.   The service was friendly - joking about the rain and getting drenched. We ordered coffee and our meals. I had an eggs Benedict with a side of sausage. It was average food; I think it spent too much time under the heat lamp since the hollandaise had congealed and burned a bit (somehow?). They had a couple servers for a packed place due to the rain but they had things under control.   Overall it's a decent place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love their fancy all day breakfast, especially \"Natasha\". mmmm... salmon, caviar, cream cheese on eggs, fries and try the rye toast it has that crunch Or try the \"truckers breakfast\" that comes with pancakes. They make awesome pancakes."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The staff here are very friendly and the food is perfection on a plate. I am sitting here having the Hazel's Hash. It is so fresh and so good. I had the Eggs Natasha when I was here last. I hate pancakes but I loved the Eggs Natasha. I never had black caviar before, but it was superb. I am very impressed with this restaurant, which is now my favorite breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Food was made really quick and was absolutely delicious! I would go early, we had to wait a bit to get a table, but once you're in service is super quick. Staff are friendly despite them being super busy."}
{"text":"Dropped in here again but during the day, not a large menu beyond breakfast but the food was still fantastic. One of my top 10"}
{"text":"Average food. Excellent service. I would return to the restaurant if it didn't smell like bathroom. The door to the bathroom downstairs was open the whole time we were there. If I closed it, someone would open it. No one who worked there closed the door. The smell ruined my experience.  I don't understand how people are able to enjoy their meal, with the smell of bathroom wafting through the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the Trucker's Breakfast and Eggs Natasha. Both were good. The over easy eggs were a little hard for me but no big deal. The Eggs Natasha were pretty good. They had the door open while we were there (it was a nice day out) so we had some unwelcome guests (flies, bees) join us. The server was good but it took awhile to get our food. We'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Good service, nice atmosphere (but very loud).  The hash browns needed more seasonings, too bland.  The bacon was really tough.  The omelette had that dry, tough 'skin' on the outside.  My wife had the Loaded Waffle which she hoovered up really fast... it was a nice soft waffle with fresh fruit and the whipped cream, though artificial, tasted good with it, she said."}
{"text":"Was taking a stroll on Sunday morning, saw this small joint. Was it ever packed, had to wait 20 mins to get a seat. However, it was worth the wait. I had a sore throat, and I guess vitamin C is good so I ordered their freaky squeezed juice. It's very good they have orange and grapefruit or half and half. 1st time I didn't have coffee but juice, a bit healthy :P but the breakfast wS just amazing. Specially the egg Natasha, my gf loves salmon and did she ever love the breakfast. As she described the flavor of the salmon and the quantity, I would sum it with it was worth every penny as for the egg Benedict, if you love breakfast as much as I do and love a non strong mustard or non creamy hollandaise, you will love this place. It was almost just right. As you will see from the pic, they sort of put it in the oven for a bit too long, where they would loose a point. But likewise I loved their breakfast sausages. It was just amazing, didn't feel like I was eating oily fat at all. I would go again for the orange juice and those breakfast sausages."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad. Reminded me of a place I miss in my hometown."}
{"text":"A real diner in Wanless/Bedford Park? Get out! Go for the All Day Breakfast!"}
{"text":"There isn't too many good brunch places up North so we decided to go to Hazel's Diner. The food was good - I got the Eggs Natasha and my bf got The Cake. Large portions of food and it was good but nothing really stood out. My stomach was also not feeling that great after eating here for the second time so it's a bummer...."}
{"text":"Many years ago, I moved to an apartment in the middle of the city. I lamented the lack of affordable dining options, specifically a spot for an inexpensive, greasy spoon style breakfast. Sure, I had McDonalds and Timmies and Starbucks nearby, but shouldn't there be an option somewhere between a $5 McMuffin combo and a $20 white-tablecloth affair? Sometimes a guy wants to roll out of bed, pick his jeans up off the floor, and cure his ills with bottomless (good) coffee and bacon+eggs.   Some years (and a temporary move to the 'burbs) later, I'm back in the heart of the city and loving almost every minute of it. I'm not far from the Eglinton strip, and while I'm often dismayed at the carnage new streetcar construction has inflicted on local businesses (stops to pour one out for House of Chan, Tasty Chinese, Ken Fong and others), I welcome those brave enough to set up shop west of Avenue Road.   Hazel's is one of those brave souls.  Hazel's opened around the time I moved back downtown, and has been busy ever since. It's an outpost of a mini chain of diners, more upscale than Wimpy's with higher prices (although a $7 bacon and egg early bird special is good value). A sandwich board outside promises a variety of breakfast specials with exotic ingredients. Great stuff, but if I want a diner I want a grease transfusion.   My introduction to Hazel's is sub-optimal. Meeting my folks for breakfast on a snowy winter morning, we are told that we have to leave my kid's stroller outside, in the middle of a busy street, with no way to secure it against a rash of thefts in the area. After much back and forth, they reluctantly agree to let us keep it inside at the table, if we forgo a high chair and feed our very busy baby in our laps. We want to order the baby some fruit-a half portion, since we know we will be cleaning most of it off the floor before we leave. This sets off another round of extensive bargaining. More trouble than it's worth.   Coffee arrives quickly; it's hot and fresh, and refilled often without having to flag a server down. Breakfast itself is a bit of a wait, which is surprising since we're the first people there.   When food arrives, it's generally good. Scrambled eggs are fluffy and loose, as requested. Bacon is burnt to hell, as is my preference. Sausages are thick and bronzed and filling, presented with a choice of hot sauce (breakfast needs to hurt a little).   Pancakes admirably soak up syrup while maintaining a crisp edge. My mom orders onion rings. I don't know why. They're really good, though; golden and crunchy outside, with yielding oniony centres.   The biggest sore point are the potatoes. Full disclosure: I am not generally a potato fan, and for breakfast vastly prefer American style crispy shredded hash browns to the.starchy under cooked chunks I often see here. Hazel's are definitely on the starchy, under cooked chunk side. Even requested \"super well done\" they need a visit to the deep fryer and a good hit of salt. I could slather them with hot sauce and ketchup, but really they're a drag on the meal and a waste of precious carbohydrates.  The bill arrives quickly, although change lags. Notwithstanding the surprising issues accommodating new parents (I like to think I'm not one of those unreasonably demanding parents who hovers over his precious snowflakes, but surely there's a place to fit a stroller or two so they're usable when we leave), service is pleasant, and we leave full and happy.   If you're wondering Which Hazel's you should visit. I vote for this one."}
{"text":"Would actually give this place five stars for ambiance.  Wonderful spruced up neighborhood diner.  Mainly for breakfast with many options. My breakfast was overdone;  eggs scrambled hard, bacon fine, potatoes good, toast saturated in butter or margarine. Waitress was cheerful and took care of everyone easily.  However I really don't like being charged extra for coffee.  It's a breakfast standard."}
{"text":"I have a bit of an addiction to their eggs Natasha, on an english muffin & additional spinach. This place has a simple menu, which makes it nice to come to as a brunch place. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is a nice and fresh as well.   It's mainly an older man who runs the shop and the longest I've ever waited is about 10 minutes. The shop itself has very basic decor and has a large \"Specials of the Day\" blackboard. The service is always fast and the food is consistently cooked well and served at very large portions.  Definitely check out this place if you're looking for a simple brunch, especially after a crazy night out!"}
{"text":"When you think about a good diner, you anticipate tasty but not too healthy greasy hangover food that likely comes from a kitchen that hasn't been updated since the 50s.  Hazel's is a bit different than your average diner experience. They don't have much in terms of comfy diner booths (bummer), but in turn provide somewhat gourmet food coming from a visibly clean kitchen (bonus points!).  The burger and the shoestring fries are very good and it seems that the owners are trying to compete with the new Burger's Priest next door! Be warned that the burger and especially fries will be mysteriously extra soggy if you ask for takeout, so take the time to enjoy your burger right away! The service is very pleasant and amicable and the prices are reasonable. The wait time for the food might be a bit longer than expected, but you can just use that time to bask in one of the better diner atmospheres in the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a diner. An honest to goodness diner. Staff are accommodating, efficient, and friendly. Food is excellent for diner fare. I come here often through the week but stay away on weekends. To quote Yogi Berra \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded\".  I'm deliberating on a four star rating. Not so much through the fault of the diner but that of the patrons.  Privileged parents and the boorish heirs can grow tiresome quickly.  Five stars it is. This is a diner!"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday.  The place was steady with customers, but usually one table was available for walk-ins.  I was there before 11am, so I was able to get the all-day breakfast (2 eggs, bacon (you cannot substitute for another meat), toast, homefries) for $5.99 instead of $8.99.  Service was friendly and food came quickly once we ordered.  My friend had an omelette ($13.99) and when she asked for no homefries the server was nice enough to suggest substituting tomatoes, grilled or fresh.  I got a smal grapefruit juice ($3) which is fresh squeezed.  It is really small, I'd say about 5 oz.  But it was good.  Overall, the place is clean, staff is friendly.  It's a nice neighbourhood place.  Anything but the all-day breakfast seems a bit prices, including the drinks/tea.  My $5.99 breakfast with a small grapefruit juice and my friend's omelette and tea came to over $30."}
{"text":"This the the only cool diner place I can find close to Yonge and finch area. I am so happy when I discovered this little gem.  Usual diner seating, great service and very good brunch.  I had \"the caker\" and my hubby had the big breakfast.  They are both good.  The waffle for my caker is very tasty.  This is now go to diner spot."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great potions and good coffee!  My BFF and I meet at various midtown places for brunch a couple of times a month.  Need a relaxed place to sit, enjoy good food and linger to play catch up.  Since we have midweek time free we were in on a Tuesday around 10 am and had a perfect get together over a generous portion big breakfast.  The home fries are great and not greasy!  Lovely waitress I assumed is the owner.  Will go again and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome diner. Exactly what you want from a diner.  Kids had milkshakes and service was fantastic.  Fries may be a bit peppery for little ones, but otherwise a great new gem in the neighborhood. Wish they were open for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good portion. One of the best brunch in north york area. Defn go there again."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with the family!   The food was great, the portions were large, everyone was very pleased!  I got the All Day Breakfast, my partner got the Trucker's Special (with extra sides!), and the other people at our table got the Mexican Benny or the Eggs Natasha. It didn't feel too greasy, the pancakes were fluffy, the coffee was good. Happy eaters all round.  We would definitely return!"}
