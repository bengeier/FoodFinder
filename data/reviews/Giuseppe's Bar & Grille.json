{"text":"Damn good pizza. We will be back for The Original Giuseppe's Pizza. Their Hangover Burger which came with fries was also very good. Could've eased up on the lettuce. Overall, great food and great service. The pizza being so good got this place the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the service was very poor, I had to keep asking for what I needed, for example a side dish with our appetizers, did the server expect us to eat over the table? When my entree of pasta came, she never offered Parmesan cheese, I had to ask for it. The coffee, was luke warm, and when we asked for a piece of bread with our meal, we were told it was $2.00 extra. For bread?? Get a grip........My biggest gripe is that the food was aweful.......this is not like the original Giuseppes on Durango. I will not return to Anthem."}
{"text":"Not at this location anyway,moved to old Vox restaurant at horizon ridge and eastern in albertsons plaza"}
{"text":"Our family has dined her often & their food is delicious! The staff is friendly. My favorite is the pecan crusted halibut that was on special one night. It was $ 24 but a big piece of fish! The last time we were there we had a waiter we had never had before & he wasn't that great. Service was slow but it was really busy that night, with all tables being full. After reading some of the negative posts, I hope they improve their servers."}
{"text":"I order from this place often being that I have 5 kids and sometimes it's hard to cook a big meal. Over all the food is good. They have a lot to choose from. Most of the time I get eggplant with a salad both of which never disappoint. I get the kids either pizza or chicken finger an they always seem happy with both. Over all the food isn't beyond amazing but it does the trick if you want a tasty meal close to home."}
{"text":"I have to say that the bartenders here are great! They can't do enough for you. Very welcoming and hospitable. The food is good and desserts are fabulous! We love it here now! And.....we win money here, too!"}
{"text":"This place gets slammed pretty hard (I reviewed Yelp before going in), but I just didn't see it.  I love the other Giuseppe's and because of that the Anthem location earned a visit.  This is a beautiful building with gorgeous decor on the inside.  We had lunch on a weekday and opted to sit in the bar thinking we would get faster service.  The bartender did not seem to care and has obviously refined the art of ignoring customers and chatted up her friends instead of greeting us (why they aren't getting 5 stars).  Moments later, however, the (only one working) waitress came in from the restaurant and took our orders, answered menu questions, etc.  She was incredibly professional, friendly and prompt.  The food was good.  Not as good as the other location (they are different ownership), but that could be transient... I understand that food is rarely identical and the quality wasn't that far off.  All in all, I would go back here.  It seems like the big issues are service which is highly subjective.  The girl that helped us made the visit enjoyable.  Had someone else helped us I'd probably be screaming like everyone else."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a little of everything. It's really reasonably priced and the food isn't bad. I wouldn't say the food is excellent, but it is what you'd expect for the price. The service when we went was incredibly slow, though friendly. There was barely anyone in the restaurant, so I'm not sure why it was so slow. The atmosphere is an odd mix of a sit-down restaurant and a sports bar, but I guess they were trying to appeal to the Vegas crowd (though it's nowhere near the strip). I'd go back if I had to but I wouldn't rush in."}
{"text":"Aw, I wanted to like this place SO badly because it's practically the only restaurant in the neighborhood. It was very cute inside, and my non-fancy self thought the menu looked quite tasty. The creamy chicken soup was very good. Unfortunately, the Chicken Parmesan that came afterwards tasted like something that would be served on the \"before\" portion of a restaurant makeover show. The chicken and the very oversauced pasta had very little flavor, and what was there wasn't very good at all. 

I want to see this place succeed and serve tasty food to this very underserved neighborhood. Keep trying Giuseppe! I'll give you another try next time!"}
{"text":"I was here today for lunch and the pasta size was literally about four bites, it looked like a side item... while the flavor was good the portion was very very small (I asked for bread and was charged $2 for stale bread).  Another time I came here about midnight and the food they brought out to me was cold and obviously not fresh.  I've also been here for breakfast and it was decent, but out of those three experiences only one was decent.  This property seems to lack management while the PT's nearby is pretty consistent on their food and it's fresh."}
{"text":"We arrived after 6pm on a Friday night. There was a 25-30min wait for the dining room so we chose to sit in the bar. We were greeted promptly. We ordered our drinks & our meal. We had the Chicken Chopped Cobb salad and a full rack of Ribs.  
They brought us fresh & hot bread with olive oil & balsamic. It was delicious!  The ribs came with your choice of soup or salad we choose the soup, Clam Chowder which was delicious!!  Our food came out shortly after that! 
The ribs arrived with French Fries & Cole Slaw. The ribs were tender and came with just the right amount of BBQ sauce! The fries were hot and the cole slaw was just the way we like it, creamy & crispy!
The Chicken Chopped Cobb salad was fresh and had just the right amount of toppings. 
During our meal the server was attentive & friendly and the manager even stopped by to ask how our meal/experience was tonight. 

Overall a great experience & we will be back!"}
