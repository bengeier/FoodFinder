{"text":"Lovely fresh juices, plenty of healthy and filling options. The staff was very helpful and friendly in helping me decide on what to have. I had the veggie burger with the Delice JR smoothie. My friend had the quinoa salad with the Mango Mango smoothie. All delicious but I would recommend the burger for something a bit more filling"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's close to work, but I really don't...
They're smoothies aren't smooth at all and the food I tried was bland.

I've given up on this place."}
{"text":"I went here with a Groupon deal, expecting fruity delicious smoothies. When I arrived there were little kids milling around behind the counter while no employees were in sight. When finally greeted by an employee we ordered a raspberry blackberry chia seed and a strawberry banana smoothie. The fruit is not fresh, it's all frozen. Both smoothies were gross and tasted overwhelmingly of wheat germ and dirt not fruit. I don't know what everyone else got but our smoothies were not good. Definate miss"}
{"text":"We stopped here while we were exploring Montreal. At the moment I am really into juicing so I did not pay much attention to the rest of the menu. The juice was good but there was a lot of foam, due to the type of juicer they use. 

Also, I did not see the employee who helped us wash his hands one single time. He took care of us and a couple of customers afterwards, dealing with the register/money and the fresh fruits as well ! Ew ew ew"}
{"text":"I tried this place today and I was so disappointed. I had a carrot ginger soup, it tasted like water with ginger. I tried the edamame vitality bowl, it was also very disappointing, it only tasted like the dressing. Also, the counter was messy and dirty, the blenders were full of juice, not covered and not in the fridge, none of the two employees were taking care of it during the 30 minutes that I was there. ( it was on a Monday night at 7pm so they weren't busy at all). You can see the kitchen when you go to the bathroom and it did not look clean. No tablespoons for the soup, we had to use teaspoons. The girl who brought my food was nice."}
{"text":"Nouveau venu, j'étais curieuse de le découvrir.  Ma salade Aagrumes, avocat et coriandre et quinoa, légumes et canneberges était délicieuse.

On retrouve un grand choix de jus, smoothies, cocktails. J'ai choisi un smoothies kale/lait de coco/dattes

Le service est un peu lent. Ca va se replacer j'imagine. Ca gagne à être connu"}
{"text":"If you need a giant vegan milkshake fit, this is the place. The Pina Colada one was refreshing.

It's mostly known as a smoothie joint (don't forget to take a loyalty card) but they also got some decent sandwiches. That falafel wrap in the display looked huge.

I know that some people will complain about the price, but you're paying for better, healthier ingredients.

I'd admit the portobello burger was a little underwhelming for the price, but they got decent lunch specials."}
{"text":"Incredible beet burger and they wrapped mine with a butter lettuce wrap, my cousin loved the carrot soup - everything was perfect, especially the wonderful staff, thanks Melissa!!!"}
{"text":"Just read a comment on how \"expensive\" that place is, and it's complete BS! That place is just AMAZING. I has their combo and had it with their ceasar salad, the beet burger and the energy ball for 15$ only, and it blew me away! I've tried Copper Branch, Aux Vivres, Lola Rosa etc and this is to me, by far, the best vegan food I've had in Montreal. 

The consistency or their beet patty is on point, and that burger topped with the dijon mustard and the freshness of the tomatoes and onions is a great combination! 

The ceasar salad tasted SO authentic, I had to stop eating to take a moment LOL. So delicious! You know how long since I've had ceasar salad?! They nail this salad. Next time I'm gonna have the meal portion of that salad, I really could not get enough. There's chickpea bacon which reaaaally tasted like bacon and added just the right amount of crunch and saltiness. The salad was absolutely amazing! I want more already.

And it also came with the energy ball dessert which is an extremely moist ball of pistaccio, lemon and dates, coated with some cononut shreds... You guys... I can't even stress how good and refreshing this was after my meal. I'm SUCH a fan. You guys will LOVE it. And it was so cheap for all of this!! Like whaaaaat?! I'm now obsessed. I'm about to spend my whole paycheck there, pay their rent and praise this place to Jesus . Amen!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food made with love. They recommended the veggie (beet) burger which was fantastic. I should have gotten some of the Dijon to go because it was amazing. Also got a juice which went great with the burger. Omnivore friends were at Schwartz deli, this is just 2 blocks away so I ate great and cruelty free and was back before they knew I was gone. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great juice shop! I came here for the sole purpose of detoxing after eating too much junk!:) The girls at the counter were very knowledgable and friendly. They assisted me with every question I had and were very patient. The juices were the best I've had and were very unique. I also ordered a raw \"macaron\" on the side. It was very good and you can tell the ingredients they use are of higher quality. The place is clean and they have a great communal table and couch area to sit and read or relax. strong wifi connection too! Will def be back before I leave Montreal!:)"}
{"text":"Nouvellement ouvert sur la rue Rachel coin St-Dominique, ce bar à smoothie végétalien (vegan) est une autre addition dans ce quartier. Local/Décoration, correct et simple. Ils ont beaucoup de choix comme smoothies ainsi que des soupes, salades-repas, wraps, desserts, cafés. Ils vendent aussi sur place des produits bio végétaliens. Je me suis pris un petit smoothie (20oz) fraises/bananes 6,95$, taxes non incluses. Le petit format est déjà assez gros, merci. Résultat, je préfère les smoothies des compétiteurs dans le quartier. De plus, j'y suis allé la 2e journée après l'ouverture et même avec tout le personnel qui y avait sur place, on m'a demandé 2 fois ma commande après 5 minutes et j'ai été servi 20 minutes après.... alors qu'on été que 2 clients sur place. Donc, conclusion, personnel encore en formation et smoothie sans grand éclat au niveau gustatif pour ma part pour le moment. De plus, au prix qu'on paye, on aimerait que ça soit servit dans des tasses éco-friendly ou encore design plutôt de vulgaires tasses de plastiques cheap, pas assez de détails à mon goût. J'attendrais d'ici quelques temps l'après rodage pour revenir et essayer un autre smoothie et/ou manger une de leurs préparations.

{"text":"Cafe Nutrimania is a great choice if you're looking for a vegan restaurant. I tend to get delivery from here and whenever I do it's very quick. I've eaten in a few times and the staff is pretty nice, but the service can be very slow. The restaurant itself is fairly small, but also quite cozy. I personally love their complimentary lime-infused water. The food is pretty expensive though, which tends to be the norm when ordering vegan food so I wasn't surprised.

I've ordered a few things off the menu and all have been good. There are quite a few options, from burgers, to milkshakes, to smoothies, etc. The restaurant itself is very accommodating when it comes to allergies (i.e. lots of gluten-free options), which is awesome. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This no-frills vegan eatery was very quiet when I went for a quick lunch on a rainy day in the middle of the week.
I ordered the falafel burger, and it arrived in just 5 minutes. Unfortunately, the falafel was stone cold, making the burger just \"meh\". At $10 for the burger without any sides, the price was ok-ish. I think the dish could have been elevated with just a little bit more care (eg, by heating the falafel).
Overall an ok lunch, but lacking the passion you may experience at other vegan places."}
