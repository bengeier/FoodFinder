{"text":"I'm very remiss for not writing a review! I've been coming here since they opened and Tropical has never let me down. Lovely people and great food. My favorites are the fresas congeladas con crema (frozen strawberries with creme) and chamoyada (your choice of fruit with chamoy, shaved ice, lime and magic fairy dust!). Recently I tried the mangoneada (frozen mango) which is also fabulous and I uploaded a picture. Go and get one. Now! Right now! And they have a loyalty card. And no, I don't any stock. But I would if they offered it. And if they franchise, I want to know! jaja"}
{"text":"If you're lookin for a snow cone made with real fruit, this place has them...Oh man, they are something of another planet."}
{"text":"Tropical Snowflake Raspados.. All our cocktail de Elote taste like water and cold when is suppose to be hot,  costumer service was by two girls, really poor in every moment, like they don't care. We had to call them out loud from inside every time we need to buy more things, that was annoying.       So sad they got new ownership, in conclusion, 2 families won't come back for sure."}
{"text":"Super clean, always a very nice service, love all the raspados, Elote en vaso with lots of cheese , Mangoneadas the best I had!! The spicy apples are always fresh  Great place."}
{"text":"My husband wanted something sweet to end the night, so I headed to Tropical Snowflake. The employees were very nice and helpful. It was delicious. I recommend getting ice cream and sweet and condensed milk on top."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their raspados are delish! I also had a chicharrón preparado. Yum"}
{"text":"Love this place.. So clean and great service! I work close by and wanted a snack and this place hit the spot. Couldn't decide what I wanted because everything looks so delicious. If you haven't been you should definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The employees were very nice and helpful. If you are craving spicy, sweet or sour this is the spot."}
{"text":"Came across this place a couple of months ago ordered 5 chamoyadas for my family they enjoyed every last bite. Friendly and great customer service. Been back every other weekend ever since."}
{"text":"Just discovered this joint right down the street from my house. I got a large Aqua Fresca and a small Elote (cup of corn) with mayo, cheese, lime and salsa. Can't wait to go back and try some of the deserts."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different so I hopped on yelp and ended up here. Delightful clean Mom & Pop kind of place. We started with the Tosti Veranda and the Tosti Ceruiti (forgive the spelling). Basically container with the round Tostito chips with cucumbers (diced small), tomatoes, cabbage, pickled pork skin (the size of little macaroni covered with type of cream not sweet and not sour and also a cheese tat reminded me of parmesan in a can (texturaly) didn't taste like that it was milder.squirted a wee bit of hot sauce. Lots of flavors and textures bottom line very tasty. Dessert was something called the Voinovich (multiple variations on the base). Apples, banana, papaya, mango, melon, grapes, cream (mildly sweet cream, shaved coconut, granola, pecans and a scoop of pistachio ice cream pretty big and heavy with fruit. This was outstanding; fruit was all very fresh lots of textures while eating. It was very refreshing and satisfying.  We will be back. Very clean including the bathroom.  Very helpful staff. I would definitely suggest this place mostly for the desserts."}
{"text":"Mediocre raspados. Not to mention, they're somewhat expensive for the quality you're given. I don't mean to be rude, but too much syrup was used, not enough ice. I orderered a mango raspado, and I was disappointed by the few small mango chunks I was given. The presentation of the drink was of low quality, but staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a regular , started coming here since they opened . Their mangoneadas , fresas , chamuoyadas are excellent but their service is poor . Very disrespectful to the customers , just disappointing. They are a bit over priced big o didn't mind it til now . Experienced the lack of professionalism from the owners themselves. Considering not coming back unless they change their attitude towards us( clients )."}
{"text":"I love it. It's best Mexican treat shop I have found here on the east side of the valley. They use fresh fruit, and no imitation flavor whatever stuff some other places use. The staff is always friendly. Been here, a few times, and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is not authentic antojitos. I ordered the corn in a cup and it was filled with water! The whole cup. I also bought a nuez raspado and the ice cream was in top! This is not how the raspado gets made. I have attached a picture. This is not an authentic place to go get your antojitos. Look at the nuezes. Go to another location same yourself some time and money."}
{"text":"If I could rate this a 10/5 I would! Such an amazing raspados place. SO GOOD. I recommend the tamarindo and mango!!"}
{"text":"OK so they opened and I have someone very close to me that is VERY addicted to things like escamochas and raspados and such. I get roped into going and I can't believe how much I fell in love with this place. I get the fire cheetos with nacho cheese and the tostitos with Chicharon and Pepihuates....All really good. My kids love the ice cream and I have to say that is not regular ice cream. The cotton candy in particular is very good. Everything appears to be very fresh there and we met the owner. She seems really nice too. I'm really happy to have a great place like this so close to where I live so I don't have to drive really far into Phoenix."}
{"text":"Authentic antojitos! This place is amazing and has lots of options. Raspados, Chamoyadas, Tostilocos and so much more! If you're looking for a snack during work, after work or on the weekend, this place is the spot. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Noon on Thursday and they aren't open. Sign said open at 10. Well, not today. Ive never tried them and I was looking forward to finding something good that was close to work."}
{"text":"I brought my family here to cool off.  I was pleasantly surprised with the fresh ingredients and generous servings.  The wait time was just right,  considering that every dessert was made from scratch.  I'd come here more often if it wasn't so far from my home."}
{"text":"A very clean place!!  Everything super delicious, I usually drive all the way from North of Scottsdale,  love it!!!"}
{"text":"Escamochas are made exactly as I remember them in my younger days. I still have to try other items from their menu, but this place is very clean."}
{"text":"Yummy! What a treat on a hot day. The staff was so helpful since we had never been here before. Yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night. Place is very clean. The family running shop were very friendly. I got the Bionico which was massive! Lots of everything - fruit variety, coconut, granola, cream and ice cream. It really was a 2 man dish. I could barely eat half, had to save the rest for later. It seemed pricey for $6.50 but is was so huge it could easily more then fill 2 adults. Will be trying other stuff soon. I liked it better then Fruitlandia in Mesa."}
{"text":"Great authentic tasting raspados  Medium size is around $3  I tried ciruela & tamarindo raspados they were good !!"}
{"text":"Last night at AZ bike week and we just found this place and it is amazing.  The people who work here are very helpful and the fresh fruit is very good. I would recommend this place to anyone who gets even close to this area."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but the elote in the cup was so horrible, so much mayo and cheese it's over powering your palate for the corn."}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean. I love their elote and escamoda. I haven't had the other things on the menu, but it all looks delicious. I always come here for a treat. I enjoy that this place is a reasonable distance from where I live and it seems to be the only raspado place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS! Terrible service!! Went with a large group. We had TWO separate orders helped by two different ladies. 1st order was fine, 2nd order took FOREVER and to top it off they overcharged us. The   lady that helped us claimed we didn't pay for the first order but we had both receipts. She refused to give us the money back because we all walked in together and to her that is proof that it was one full order. You can easily find better treats elsewhere. don't trust them. THEY ARE THIEVES AND OVERALL A TERRIBLE BUSINESS!!"}
{"text":"This place is Yummmm! My little monster just got his shots and I promised him ice cream but this is better.   FRESH FRUIT ! Wins for sure in the mom book"}
{"text":"It's my first time to try it here.   It's so Good , Delicious with fresh tropical mango. Hummm. Yum Yum   Tried some other place. Here still be the best. Wish this place closer to my house, then can be regular customer.   Anyway Will be back soon. ;)"}
{"text":"The Elote tasted like vomit.. for whatever reason, my boyfriend also agreed with me on it. Our elote was like calm chowder, with no chilies at all. When we tasted it, it tasted like expire sour milk. The problem with our manganda was that it was over spices so we didn't taste the mango at all"}
{"text":"new to me!!!! but it's kinda great. shaved ice...with whole fruit soaked till it's syrupy and then loaded into a cup with the shaved ice. you can add all kinds of stuff to it...i chose condensed milk (because i've had something like it before, so i wanted to be somewhat \"in the know\"). it is sweet and cold and hit the spot after working in the yard all day.   there are all kinds of options here. luckily the staff wasn't too busy so i spent the time asking them \"what is that? what is that? what is that?\" and they were more than happy to explain it to me.   another refreshing treat from our neighbors to the south. they do have the standard fruit and cream and some delicious looking granola, fruit, and yogurt snacks as well!"}
{"text":"Large selection of mexican creative fruit and snacks desserts. Hot cheese on cheetos, mango with chili powder, and ice cream."}
{"text":"I got a medium Chamoyada  for $3.99 with tax.  A chamoyada comes with shaved iced, fruit/juice of your choice (I got mango), chamoy, chili powder, lime, tamarind candy, and Japanese peanuts. I ordered mine without peanuts. It was very delicious but waaaaay too sweet for my liking. I think the mango juice over powered the whole thing. Next time I will ask for extra chamoy to balance out the sweetness.   At first, the lady put peanuts on them, but as soon as she was about to hand it to me, she remembered I said no peanuts. Without hesitation she made me one without peanuts, so it was a big plus for me.   The service is quick and they have a large menu to choose from. I will most likely return and try something else."}
{"text":"Never had a raspado before.  It was good - basically crushed ice with chunks of fruit and sugar water, can be topped with condensed milk and ice cream.  I'm a bit Spanish challenged, but was able to figure it out.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I lived in Mexico for nearly 5 years and have had many raspados. I think this place is 2 notches above the runner up. They use fresh ingredients and the staff is always super friendly and greet you with very welcoming smiles.  I would recommend the diabilto or the mangoneada, although anything you think that sounds good is surely to be excellent. I wish I could give them 6 stars. AMO RASPADO RICO!"}
{"text":"Great place for chamoyada! Small place with only a few tables. Extremely affordable, but most importantly tastes great too!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this kind of desert and I really liked it. We had a strawberry chamoyada and a vanilla raspado. The staff was very helpful with explaining everything to us."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a Califonia girl, a Southern California girl to be exact, and I love me some Raspado! So when I spotted this colorful little shop I heard the choir singing and angels from above saying, \" gooooo here Jackieeeeee!\"  I threw the quickest U-Turn and stepped inside.  A clean, south of the border decor, Raspado shop and all its glorious frutás!  I got a cup of cut up mango with chili ... Simple but so good!  Good enough for me to return that same day with the family!  We loved the choices and they also serve regular ice cream in a cone as well as banana splits and hot fudge Sunday's!  It's not California good but it's better than most for menu choices and friendly service!  4 stars \" I like it a lot\" review for Raspado Rico!"}
{"text":"Rude customer service, me and my friend hardly get time to eat anything with sugar and we raced to get some Raspados to treat ourselves . It was 8:53 and the girl cleaning the lobby ran to switch the sign to closed and turned off the open sign. My kids literally ran up to the door and they just ran to the back and turned off the lights."}
{"text":"I came here during the middle of a warm weekday.  The lady behind the counter was hard to hear because of the buzzing of machinery, but we eventually got my order through.  The place is small and fills up quickly when groups start coming in."}
{"text":"Que rico! Raspado is Mexican style shaved ice, oftentimes combined with fresh fruit. After a filling dinner, we decided we did have some space in our stomachs to indulge in some refreshing dessert. The restaurant has a cheery interior with lots of bright color and equally bright colored desserts available. The menu has desserts, snacks, and tortas/sandwiches to satisfy anyone wanting something sweet, light, or savory.   We tried a sample of the raspados de leche quemada which had a delicious caramelized, rich flavored milk added to the ice. We did decide on a different dessert but next time I feel like getting shaved ice I will try this version of raspados. I had the fresas con crema and tried the pico de gallo. The fresas was a huge portion of thick syrupy cream, freshly sliced strawberries, and granola. It was sweet, rich, creamy, and a great balance of textures and flavors. The pico de gallo was also good as well, with fresh mango, jicama, cucumber, and watermelon spears dusted with chili-lime powder.   At another visit I also tried the basic raspadas (Con fresas) and it was decent, but a bit too simple for me. It had syrup, a few strawberries, and shaved ice. The mangoneada I had was too much of a salty flavor for me with a few chunks of mango, mostly shaved ice, and chili lime salt with syrup.  Spanish and English are both spoken fluently here and don't be afraid to ask about the menu selections if you are new to these type of desserts. They are quite patient here!"}
{"text":"Of all the raspado places in town I have tried, Tropical Snowflake Raspados is the best. Located in a mostly empty and dated strip mall on 32nd st, north of McDowell, Tropical Snowflake Raspados is a small, but clean establishment that will surprise your taste buds.  They have many snacks to choose from, I get their mangoneadas, which are the top! Instead of using ice and adding mango syrup, they use frozen mango and fresh mango pieces to the top, plus some other tamarind candy treats!  I also tried their duros preparados. These were really good and could make  decent lunch.   They also have ice cream and aguas, plus other sweet treats you will enjoy. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Despite being Phoenix born and raised, this was my first time going for raspados. Not knowing what to expect and having limited Spanish, I'll admit I was a little intimidated. (Silly, I know, but not everyone is a brazen and fiery Pegasus!) I went with the bionico, which was a mountain of fruit and nuts in condensed milk, topped with a huge pile of ice cream (I got strawberry) and shredded coconut, and pico de gallo, a cup of fruit and jicama with a tangy chili coating. Even splitting this between 2 hungry people, it was a lot of food! I can see myself coming back here all summer long.  The seating area was clean, and only occupied by one other person, the son of the owner, who was working on his homework! Yes, it does take a little time to prepare your treat, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh raspados. My new favorite to go place. Their mangonada is fresh and prices are fair ."}
{"text":"Too pricy. Plus, the cheese is something I could get at a gas station. 12 bucks for a medium limonada and hot Cheetos with cheese. Bad call by coming here. Props on trying to bring the Mexican tradition over here though. My girlfriend had Tostitos preparados and they were filled with \"cueritos\" and nothing else. Where's the pepihuates where's the Clamato, chamoy? Overall unsatisfying experience."}
{"text":"Was craving an ice cold treat and found ourselves here. Very authentic Mexican treats. Chamoyada and mangonada were delicious! Also serves thrifty ice cream for the less adventurous. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location twice now. Both Times I really liked what I had. Tonight, I ordered the mangonada.  Not too spicy, not too salty, except the salted plum, just the right amount of sweet!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy mangonada. It took forever for the ice to melt but the flavors was on point."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food was disappointing. Had a few bites & threw the food away. Wouldn't recommend just wait until Zero Degrees is open, save your money."}
{"text":"love love it!!  yummy for our tummy!!!  everything on the menu is delicious !   reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I'm currently 8 months pregnant and woke up craving a bionico. I thought I was gonna have to drive to Phoenix to satisfy my craving but thankfully Raspado Rico is just a quick drive from me in Tempe. It was my first time and have to say as someone who has frequented many bionico spots through out my life, this place is legit. The fruit is fresh, the horchata is extremely tasty and the woman working was nice enough to gift me with a vanilla raspado simply because I mentioned it looked really good to me. I'm thinking it was a, let's be nice to the the pregnant lady thing which is always nice! Two big thumbs and happy belly up!"}
{"text":"Cute place!!! My husband and wanted a sweet treat and this was in our neighborhood. Lots of people enjoying themselves. I am not sure what I got...Sambores I think. Fresh mango ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy!  Wes got a strawberry sundae...which was gone in 5 seconds!! Check it out for a place to beat the heat."}
{"text":"Hand made fruit toppings, wonderful service and the yummy Mexican corn. This place is awesome and very conveniently located."}
{"text":"I sent my hubby here one day when I was sick. I wanted a delicious pineapple and coconut raspado and also wanted to try their version of Mexican corn. When he came back I was disappointed. I was hoping for big fresh pieces of pineapple and what I got seemed out of a can. They also put some cream on top that I was not fond of. The mexican corn was wayyyy too salty for me and drowned in cotija cheese. It seemed more like a corn chowder than what I have experienced in the past. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it fell completely flat!"}
{"text":"This is a small shop that sells all kinds of Mexican drinks & dessert. I got a drink that was super sour but I know (after I ordered it of course) that was normal lol. There are no more than 10 tables inside the shop. If u want to come here with a bunch of friends, be prepared to order it to go."}
{"text":"As I've always said, I have a second stomach for dessert. Even though I was very full from dinner, I still have more room for dessert. Most of my close friends know I have very little exposure of Mexican food, let alone Mexican dessert. I've found myself pretty lost when I looked at the menu. I guess \"I have no idea what is what\" was written all over my face. The owner came over and explained the menu to us. People who were next in line were extremely annoyed with us asking a thousand questions. Without embarrassing myself further and holding up the line, I've decided to stick with what I know - Pico De Callo. This is actually street food when I used to live in Los Angeles. People sell them either by the Venice beach or on a shopping cart in my old neighborhood. I also saw many street vendors selling them in Mexico. I've always loved them. Having this dessert reminds me of the good time I had living in L.A......  I definitely ordered the right dessert. All the fruits were sweet, fresh and delicious. The lime and pepper add so much flavor do it and I absolutely love them. I couldn't have picked a better dessert. I peaked over to other tables and noticed they were eating something out of Dorrito bags. I have no idea what it is but for sure I'll be back to try them. I also want to make a note of how much I enjoyed watching the owners. They've worked really hard and was very nice to their customers. I'll most definitely to come back again and try something else."}
