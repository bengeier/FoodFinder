{"text":"Ariyoshi is an outstanding sushi restaurant!  We've been there twice in the past few weeks.  One test of a sushi restaurant is to ask the chef to prepare a roll of his own choosing.  First time, we ended up with \"Funny Kiwi\", a roll with excellent mix of interior items and an exterior coating of thinly-sliced kiwi.  So good that we ordered that again the second visit.  The other items were also excellent.  The \"Black Dragon\" roll had excellent flavors.  Also try the \"Avacado and Peanut\" roll.  On the second visit, we happened to catch a pre-8:00 price special  ---  any single sushi or sashimi for $1.  We had three each of four different sushi for the four of us, as well as several named rolls.  There are at least 4 other places for sushi in Cleveland Heights.  Two of them within a stone's throw of Ariyoshi.  Pacific East on Coventry is the best of the competition and we still think Pacific East is excellent, too.  Pacific East also offers a Malaysian menu in addition to the Japanese one."}
{"text":"Had a special for a buy one get one Hibachi style dinner. I would probably never order it but decided we would give it a try.   The Food was good but not as good as I would have expected considering the price. I don't mind paying for a nice dinner but I expect a nice dinner when I pay for it. This didn't quite deliver.   if I go back it'll be for the sushi."}
{"text":"Being half Japanese, I would like to consider myself a connoisseur of all things sushi and Ariyoshi fits my standards.  I was pleasantly surprised the first time I ate here (which is usually the case when trying out a new sushi restaurant).  There is a wide variety of sushi ranging from sashimi to big specialty rolls as well as very tasty food for you non-raw fish eating folk.    If you like to have a drink or two with dinner (I know I do!), then beware that the drink menu is quite limited.  However, there is some good sake on the menu and if you're down for a sake bomb or two, then by all means go for it (and it won't break the bank either).    To sum it up, I would say that this is a great little restaurant with good food for really good prices."}
{"text":"Menu was good and very reasonably priced. Atmostphere was pleasant and welcoming Prompt service Conveniently located"}
{"text":"Ariyoshi is under new management. While we have not done any further delivery, all the pick-up we did was very good, so I am willing to upgrade my rating."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't discover this place earlier.  Because of its convenient location, I've gone there about 5 times in the last 2 weeks.    I generally compare sushi places to Pacific East on Coventry, because they have the most delicious sushi in Cleveland.   The sushi here isn't quite as good as Pacific... but several other factors make up for it.    Ariyoshi has about 25 rolls for $3 each.  I almost always add a few rolls even if I'm ordering other foods (like udon noodles or teriyaki salmon).  The rolls are surprisingly good for the price.    I also think their udon is a little better than Pacific East, because it's not as salty as Pacific's.  Also, the ambiance of Ariyoshi is a little better than Pacific East as well.  Pacific East (bless its heart) also has a funky smell inside, which Ariyoshi.... or now that I think of it... Sushi Rock, Shu Hei, or any of the other Japanese restaurants I've ever been to, does not have.    So in summary, the food here is good, nice ambiance inside, no funky smell, good service, the prices are great (with even better deals with the lunch specials).  No complaints!"}
{"text":"WHY WHY WHY do sushi places insist on serving ice cold fish?  Sushi is meant to be eaten at room temperature, or slightly below.  It's not meant to be eaten directly from the fridge!  Cold sushi has far, far less flavor than sushi served at the proper temperature.  This is my biggest pet peeve.  If you don't even know the proper temperature to serve your food at, you should not be serving it.  Other gripe: Sushi is only available a la carte, no \"sashimi sampler\" type dishes....which means if you make a meal out of sashimi alone, you're spending about $50.  Samplers usually ring in around $20.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Cleveland but not the best sushi I have ever had (a restaurant in Lima, Peru holds that distinction).  I don't know where they get their fish, but it's absolutely mouthwatering and blows away the fish at Pacific East, Sushi Rock, or any of the other Cleveland sushi spots.  Great prices, fresh sushi, fantastic meals.  That said, not the best sushi ever, but best yet in this town - that is why it gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cleveland Heights has a number of very good sushi restaurants and Ariyoshi stacks up with the best of them. The interior of the restaurant is bright, open and welcoming. The service is excellent. Our server was attentive without being annoying. Ariyoshi has regular rolls for $3 all the time. We ordered six of them and they were all delicious. My only minor complaint with this restaurant is that they don't, for whatever reason, have descriptions of the regular sushi rolls anywhere on the menu."}
{"text":"I loveeeeee this place. It's one of the best sushi I've had in Cleveland. The staff is very nice and welcoming, the choice of special rolls are incredible. MUCH better than pacific east. Things I would complain about is probably the restaurant decor, the music they play and the wait time for our food."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese restaurant in a great location. For those of you sushi lovers out there, this is a great find. Excellent service, great atmosphere, excellent food. If you crave those pieces of fish daily and nightly (like I do) then this is the place for you. Excellent food and a great price. For those you of you not so into the raw fish scene, they have other excellent meals as well."}
{"text":"pushing to 3 start. Better not get takeout unless ur a reg. I sat at sushi bar and the magic number was 3 bucks. Martinis, beer, wine, Beer. And sushi rolls. That needless to say i got some decent drinks and rolls for 3 bucks. U do the math!. so i was happy before sushi. Talked with sushi bar and the plate they put out was competent. Fish to rice ratio was better. Still not great, but for 3$. The service was nice, and the seemed  happy that I had arrived 5 minutes before they close.  So I can bump them up to 3 stasr for a lot of threes they give me!"}
{"text":"The sushi was great and so was the chicken teriyaki. Stylish atmosphere and a wonderful staff made would this a place I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've come to realize over the last few months that Ariyoshi is a hit-or-miss kind of a sushi restaurant.  Usually, their rolls are decent and their fish is fresh.  My last trip to Ariyoshi, however, was less than pleasant.  My uni came frozen solid.  The worst part was when I told the waitress and her response was that the uni was edible before walking away and ignoring our table until we could flag her down again.  All in all, the sushi's okay and the service is incompetent to customer's needs and expectations to have non-frozen food.  I have yet to find another decent sushi restaurant in Cleveland, so I would only recommend Ariyoshi if you were desperate for some Japanese cuisine.  If any fellow Yelpers find a better sushi place, please pass along the find."}
{"text":"I would call this place \"fresh and tasty\" if I was in charge of naming, because lets face it, I have no idea how to pronounce the name. And Fresh and Tasty would not be an ironic hipster named place, a place teeming with thick-rimmed glasses, Ben Gibbard look-alikes, and MacBooks, because Ariyoshi is fresh and.... wait for it.... i see you shiver with antici....pation..... tasty.  I got the chicken teriyaki and my date got faux-sushi (i.e. no fish were harmed in their making). I was impressed with both. The chicken was well cooked, and the sauce was amazingly good. The miso soup was miso soup-esque, so if miso is you thing, dig in. My entire plate was wonderful.  My date's shrimp and crab roll things were reasonably priced for sushi and good as well. But I was too busy trying to fumble around with chopsticks and get rice to fill my gaping maw.   The service was also amazing. Our server was always around without that weird hovering thing that waiters seem to love to do at places."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland, my husband and I came here for dinner with our Cleveland relatives.   I have to say, I was really impressed with the sushi at this restaurant.  They have a really good selection of sushi rolls.  We ordered a number of rolls and one of their nigiri dinners to share. Everything was great! I especially loved the Beauty Roll and Dragon Roll.  The only negative is that it takes forever to get your food once you order.  So, don't come here if you're super hungry."}
{"text":"Ariyoshi vs. Pacific East  Be mindful that for my Japanese food, I only care about tempura and rolls.  Atmosphere:  TIE Pacific East is much smaller and more cramped. Their furniture is old, bordering wobbly. It was almost full when I went. Ariyoshi is much larger, but it was almost empty the two times I went. The extremely good waiter to customer ratio is haunted by awkward silence. You also save couple quarters, since you pay the meters to go to Pacific East.  Tempura: TIE While I enjoy tempura, I don't think I'm good enough to differentiate the subtleties. Both restaurants gave similar portion of crispy tempuras, coupled with the delicious sauce that I can't identify.  Rolls: Ariyoshi  It's been several months since I went to Pacific East, but I remember not being impressed; it was whatever. Then I tried Thai rolls in Ariyoshi, and DAMN they were awesome. I tried two other rolls there as well, and they were great. But the Thai rolls! THAI ROLLS!  Bottom line:  If you are fan of rolls, go try the Thai rolls. If you haven't had too much exposure to Japanese food, try my favorite dinner: mixed tempura for appetizer and Thai rolls for entree. Order Sapporo if you like beer."}
{"text":"I am a fan. been a fan of sushi and sashimi since my first experience back in high school. There are many great things about Ariyoshi: pumpkin tempura roll, edemame, and the miso soup being just a few. However, don't look on getting out of there in any less than a couple hours if you plan on sitting down. While I would expect this at a place like Sushi Rock on W.6th, it's a surprise for. Although take-out is very quick (only about 10 minutes) the wait for food does deter me a bit from going there more often.   Overall a good place to try for first timers"}
{"text":"To be succinct: 1. Food delivery was unacceptable: Food arrived at scattered intervals.  The first sushi was brought out for one person...then 5 minutes later another person's sushi was brought out... then 5 minutes later another sushi was brought out... and this continued for a span of 30 minutes.  No one was able to eat together based on this. 2. Waitress was not attentive to table: She never checked on us - we had to physically get up and find her if we needed water. 3. Incorrect orders: All orders were incorrect, despite our table writing them down for her.   4. Did not honor specials: Despite website promoting  1/2 price sushi night on Wednesday, the management said that the website was \"outdated and old\" and they weren't honoring the discount. The promotion is STILL posted on their website. 5. Food quality: VERY poor. Unfortunately we were unable to consume our meals - the fish was not fresh and tasted unfresh. 6. Final Bill: The bill was completely incorrect AND it took over 15 minutes to receive the check/bill when we asked.  When we mentioned the incorrect items on the bill it took another 10 minutes to explain that we didn't order certain items and to have them removed.  In closing, this was a terrible dining experience. I would not recommend this to anyone.  Instead of this sushi restaurant, choose another one.  Might I recommend Sushi Rock or Otani or Shuhei to start."}
