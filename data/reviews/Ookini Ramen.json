{"text":"As a frequenter of Marda Loop, I was happy to see a new ramen restaurant. Upon entering, the restaurant appears clean and modern. My husband and I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and the Ookini ramen. Unfortunately, both were bland and left much to be desired. The broth had no depth of flavour and the char-siu tasted like regular pork without any hint of barbecue or smokiness. The restaurant itself was quiet, with only one other table occupied during a weekend. While service was quick and attentive, it's the food that counts and it's awfully hard not to compare their ramen against the many other ramen joints in town that know how to serve a darn good bowl of noodles. Overall, we won't be returning unfortunately."}
{"text":"The food was great, the soup was the most authentic and tasty ramen I had in Calgary. We ordered the Ookini and miso, Ookini has a very complex taste with a rich pork broth and some seafood flavour. We also ordered the Sencha tea and tasted fresh and organic. Overall a great addition to the Marda loop community."}
{"text":"I had the Ookini ramen. Loved their broth - very flavorful and clean, no MSG! Nice selection of vegetables that top their ramen. Hubby thought portions were a bit small, but for me it was more than enough. I think it was one of the best ramen places for me. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time was good and i would give 4/5 stars, but he second time was very disappointing. The soup was very different maybe they changed chefs? The pork tasted nothing like char siu, more like any kind of Chinese braised pork, and the soup was very oily. The noodles were also thick and overcooked."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant and I found the soup to be very clear and refreshing. Not the typical deeply flavoured broths you would find at other ramen restaurants. My husband and I had takoyaki (which was made in house), miso ramen (chicken base) and ookini ramen (pork base) and found them all very tasty!  Not to mention the decor gave a very welcoming Japanese feel but was tasteful and modern. 

 Ultimately as a customer I would come again and again!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see some Ramen in my part of town, so we went out Sunday for lunch to give it a try. I had the Goma Chili and had to say it was quite good; I'm not a fan of fish cake so I was glad it was listed on the ingredients and they had no issue holding it from the order. My wife had a different order which I can't remember, but it wasn't as much to my preference. The menu seems to have a few distinct choices, and I think there should be something for every Ramen lover.

The service was friendly and bringing our three-year-old wasn't an issue. We'll likely be coming back to get our Ramen fix."}
{"text":"Pretty good Ramen, kind of inconsistent from experience to experience, but the customer service is awesome and the ramen is the best in Marda Loop."}
{"text":"Environment: Newly opened restaurant, clean, and has a very modern style. Bathroom is clean which is always a plus.

Food: I ordered the Ookini Ramen and Pork Siu Bao. The pork bun was bite size. The steamed bun felt slightly hard with little to no taste. The pork was very oily and slightly overcooked. The overall taste was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. The soup base for the ramen also lacked flavour. I was really disappointed when I first tasted it. The vegetables in the ramen were undercooked and hard. The egg was not seasoned... my impression was they just cut a boiled egg in half and placed it in the ramen. The pork in the ramen was hard and mostly burnt. The ramen itself was very thick. Overall, I am glad that I tried this place, however there are other ramen restaurants in Calgary to excite your palate. 

Service: The service was quick. The server was very polite and was always checking in. The server asked for feedback at the end when I was paying so I ended up talking about my meal."}
{"text":"Today felt like a Ramen kinda day & since I saw some appetizing pics on Instagram about this place, I had to try it for myself!

The place is easy to find and is located in a nice neighbourhood with plenty of parking. 

We got our table quickly & ordered our food
The service was fast & we had a very polite friendly server :)

We were starving so while we studied the menu, we ordered our appetizer and it arrived very promptly. 

I'm a sucker for simple menus & this definitely is one of those, plus it has pictures!!! 

The food was very generous & it really hit the spot!

Will keep this place in mind next time I'm in mood for Ramen.

The reason comfort is 3.5 is because if you are not on the sofa side of the table, you are basically sitting on a stool, so nothing to lean on :("}
{"text":"Prompt service. Good selection. Very tasty. What more is there for Ramen?? Wait... fresh made... not too salty like many others. Awesome decor and Japanese DJ tunes."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen and good service. Had the Tonkatsu Black which had excellent flavor. A little strange to charge extra for the egg though."}
{"text":"Saw the sign of a new ramen joint in Marda Loop - Was excited as it was within a 5 minute drive from home.  I heard they were having a soft opening a couple of weeks ago and decided to try tonight thinking they were fully open now.

NOPE.

Still a soft opening with very limited items on the menu.  Basically everything you did want to try wasn't available (ie Tsukemen - Chick/Pork Broth).

Ordered the Ookini Ramen, Miso Ramen and the Ookini Buns (char-sui sliders).

1. Ookini Ramen - The pork broth had the usual milky opaque colour to it, but it really lacked any distinct flavour.  The noodles and toppings were ok - nothing special.  The tamago soft boiled egg was cold and again lacked any flavour too (it was advertised as marinated).  Last thing was the char-sui was really thinly sliced - almost bacon sliced thin.  I was expecting thick cut like other places.

2. Miso Ramen - My wife had this and she said it was ok, just a bit too salty.

3. Ookini Buns - They weren't kidding when they called them mini-sliders.  They were basically single bite buns.  Pretty good but nothing to rave about.

Overall Ookini can satisfy your ramen craving if you're not willing to go anywhere else.  Pricing was on par with places like Shiki Menya or Momofuku, but the flavour is definitely not."}
{"text":"I went here because I am a ramen obsessed person! My mom saw this place yesterday so we decided to check it out after work today. If I am not mistaken, this business is only a year old. Place is small but neatly designed. 

Service was prompt-- there's only one server but she approached us as soon as we walked in the door. 

As per the food, we ordered pork buns, Tonkotsu, and Miso. Pork buns here are actually cheaper than Jinya pork buns (maybe because Jinya is already an established ramen bar. Don't get me wrong, I really love Jinya Ramen Bar) . For Tonkotsu, its broth had a rich flavour and texture of noodles were great. For Miso, well I really don't like miso in the first place but theirs was good. Servings of ramen-- I can say that it could possibly be shared by 2 people.

Since the place is along 33 Ave SW, you might think that it's hard to find a parking space. There's actually a parking lot behind it, so it's a plus!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, massive and very well priced. Our server was accommodating and friendly and even made my fussy five-year-old into a believer. Please eat here as they deserve to be lined up out the door!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food just isn't very good. The noodles had an bad taste and texture, flavorless broth and tough meat. If you want real ramen there are much better places in town."}
{"text":"From Portland and this would compare to some of the best ramen we have eaten"}
