{"text":"A very interesting little place for kimchi lovers. All sorts of kimchi: green onion, radish, cabbage, fresh and maybe a bit more fermented. They have it all. They didn't have the dumplings today as they sold out, they had a special kimchi sale day :) I think they distribute to restaurants as there is not much traffic in the place yet. And it's new and its a bit secluded. The girl at the counter speaks enough English for us to get along, she even shared her lunch with us and let us try some of those dumplings. Absolutely delicious! She will make a new batch tonight and saving me a bag for tomorrow. If you lie kimchi this place is a must visit. Came home, tasted the kimchi- simply delicious!! And forgot to say, it's cheaper than anywhere else! Turns out they make the kimchi right here in Mississauga.. So we have a kimchi factory in our own little town :)"}
{"text":"I was torn whether or not to give this place 4 OR a whoppin' 5 stars, but seeing how giving this place a 4 would lower their overall rating, I'll stick with the majority!  This is a clean unit within an industrial strip, just South of the Dundas overpass on the westside of Cawthra.  And just like their name entails,  they sell...you guessed it, KIMCHI everything!  From your standard kimchi cabbage - kimchi green onions - other banchans and even, as fellow Yelper, Gabi experienced, homemade mandu (dumplings).  (During my brief visit, I didn't really see any mandu displayed, so I'm thinking it's something that you may have to ask about!)  There was no one behind the counter when I walked in, so you may also hafta hollar behind the counter.  This Korean lady came out and she was very friendly, explaining  how long the kimchi's been fermenting, how long it lasts for, and that it's made on-site, which is quite impressive!  Just a little over 1kg container of kimchi was $8.  Not bad, not bad at all.  And I just tried it tonight and what a flavour explosion!  Not overly salty either which I like.  Quite a pungent and fresher taste than what you'd buy at the grocery store.  So whenever I'm done with this vat, I'll definitely go back for more...hopefully some mandu as well!  ;)"}
{"text":"I love getting my kimchi here because rather than going to local supermarkets you can go directly to the source that sells the most high quality kimchi right in their factory that's open to the public! It is fresh and only uses high quality ingredients with no msg. There is a store in the front and a large back area where they make the kimchi. It is a family owned business and I absolutely won't buy my kimchi anywhere else. They also sell their kimchi in loblaws and other supermarkets but if you want really fresh kimchi come check out the store."}
{"text":"Maybe I have a hgh expectation with Kimchi Korea, my experience with it was so so.  Maybe I arrived there late for a weekday, there was hardly anything left on the shelves and no sight of any mandu left.   We ended up getting a Baek Kimchi (nappa cabbage fermented without the use of chili powder) and Baechu Kimchi. Crunchy, refreshing and subtle. Perfect for the hot weather.   But personally I do enjoy kimchi that has more punch both in spiciness and saltiness as I use mine to make kimchi soup and stew too.  I still need to try other products Kimchi Korea offers, maybe even their home made dumplings!"}
