{"text":"Delicious authentic Hyderabadi food, excellent service.
We had three kinds of kababs, Hyderabadi mutton curry, deal and biryani..all dishes were tasty. Mudassir was very attentive and was prepared to cook anything we wished."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the customer service. We asked politely how long we might have to wait and the person was very rude. Will never visit that place again. I belong to South Asia and our culture is our pride, please keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Hyderabadi food, excellent variety of dishes and reasonably priced. Wait times may be annoying at times as they are freshly prepared but it will be worth the wait. You can enjoy the Hyderabadi hospitality here, Mudassar would keep feeding you as long as you can eat :-) If you are in the mood for good authentic Indian food, try pariwar and you won't be disappointed.
Must try: chicken 65 and biriyani."}
{"text":"I had originally given them one star as zero was not an option,  because of their poor communication and lack of customer service.
They do NOT home deliver as promised, by Uber Eats or any other method.
I phoned in my order on Saturday night as they opened at noon on Sunday and I had guests for lunch.
I guess that they did not bother to record my order, and when I reached, I was told that like all the other customers there, I had to wait 20 minutes.
This is why people from the Indo-Pak subcontinent get the reputation of being unreliable.

That said, if you don't mind close quarters, sticky counter and the wait, the biryani (ordered lamb biryani) is delicious, which is why I re-scored them 3 stars instead of zero."}
{"text":"Excellent food . Needs more people to attend  the customers, and their cash register area is a chaotic zone . Everybody standing there , and the phone is answered in loud voice , very annoying .  The phone should be in the kitchen or answered in a professional manners . Wait time is very annoying, in the mean time they should offer some papadam . It is s good takeout place . But dine in is a  taste of tolerance power
Most of the Item were finished in the menu . They should make less things but well stock their kitchen even a cup of tea they could not provide or a bottle of water . They have tap water only . 
But I donot think they will care to change because they are more than busy so you have to put up with this environment  so that you can relish their excellent food . I will give them 5 star for food quality I salute the chef , but management of the front shop is one star , and the poor server even with her excellent service could not keep up the environment tension  free . Anyway I will take out next time"}
{"text":"I have been there so many times, they are one of Toronto's best biryani place.

Mostly spicy, but tastes good.

I recommend to give it a try

Little pricy for the type of restaurant. Ambiance is mostly crowded all times."}
{"text":"Yelp says they open at 11:00am today. Their website says they open at 1:00pm today. I got there around 1:30pm. I walked in, and there were already two other tables seated. The server looked sort of surprised we were there, and when I told him it was a party of two, he stopped, thought for a bit, and finally said, \"we're not open yet.\" Um, excuse me? He then said it would be at least another twenty minutes. No. Just no."}
{"text":"Foods great but the customer service is so bad that I wouldnt even think of going back...!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent indian food restaurant located at lawrence and victoria park. Tried couple of thing there. Their butter chicken and chicken masala are decent. But stay away from their beef/lamb items, i dont know what kind of meat is it but taste really weird and bad."}
{"text":"Took my parents here because we had heard good things from others but ended up having a horrible experience. We ordered the bihari kebab and chicken biryani. The kebab tasted bad and had way too much artificial colouring and the biryani made our stomachs upset. Would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I only get my biryani from here now  everything on their menu is delicious - my personal favorite is the mutton biryani and Irani chai"}
{"text":"If you are super hungry and passing by a Biriyani house, you should drag yourself to it! You will love it, no matter how they make it. 
PS. Good taste and also good portion according to the reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, they do not know how to treat customers. Arrogant, unfriendly!"}
{"text":"If you are an authentic Hyderabad Biryani lover , Pariwar satisfies you if you are in and around Markham/Scarborough. Their biryani rice has the right flavors and try their chicken 65 too - packs a punch. Even though they have a small seating place it's usually a take out place"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this place. I ordered take out for chicken biryanis and they told me to come in 30 mins to pick up. After renting a car and reaching Pariwar 30 minutes later, I was told that there is no more biryani left. The woman at the cashier was not even apologetic and didn't even pacify me. It's a shame that they don't bother informing the customer when something is out of stock and waste people's time.

Very unreliable restaurant with poor customer service. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"I work at York Mills and Don Mills area and the guys at work order food from time to time. This is one of those places. Located at Victoria Park and Lawrence area, they don't deliver I believe. That makes it a little more difficult, non the less we order when there are more people willing to place an order so it makes the trip worth it. 

Butter Chicken with naan is delicious!!!! As much as I try not to finish the entire dish -- it still happens. HAHA. I have yet to actually dine in but perhaps I will one day!!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, this place is literally 'THE PLACE' if you want authentic Hyderabadi Biryani and Salan. Big portions. Extremely satisfying to the taste buds. Super filling. These portions are also offered in trays for larger parties. 

Must try:

Special Chicken Biryani 
Chicken 65"}
{"text":"Went in.. found a seat but the place was freezinnnnng cold. Grungy looking but we went because we heard the biryani was really good.

We were told the biryani would take 30-40 minutes, I know, sounds crazy but we decided to wait. It ended up taking 55 minutes so we were upset but they didn't seem to care, guess it's a popular take out restaurant because that's where all of the biryani was going. 

The biryani had more spice than flavour so it was very disappointing. It could be that they rushed it because they ran out.. I'll probably go back to try it again to see if it's any different.

The chicken 65 was good though!"}
{"text":"Was looking for desi food at 10pm and found this place Delicious food Big portions One of the best butter chicken I've ever had But as I went the 2nd and 3rd time the portions started getting smaller and smaller .... don't know what's the reason for that but they'll lose business by trying to save few bucks"}
{"text":"Very good value and price
Will come back for chicken 65 and beriani servers were nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food, and reasonably priced.  Takes the concept of hole in the wall to a new level, however, when the food is this good who cares?  Still, it's a clean joint, and the guy at the counter, also the waiter, was efficient, if not overly friendly.  I'd come here again in a second!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best biryani place in Scarborough!! The biryani is spicy and delicious. The Chicken 65 is spicy but  melts into your mouth . The ambience is pretty decent and you can see stacks of different Indian spices .Also you get to hear the Hyderabadi Hindi from the man on the counter . But But but the service is terrible and when I say terrible it means you have to wait for 40 mins just for your biryani and another 15 mins for your starter . The first time we went there the service was pretty decent . But then after that it's just getting worse . Thanks to \"skip my dishes\"that they are delivering to my locality !! I would suggest either you use home delivery through one of the numerous apps or order your biryani and go pick it up from there !!! They need to improve their service or their rating might come down !! Enjoy your biryani:)"}
