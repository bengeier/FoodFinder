{"text":"I've only been for coffe during the day but will go for dinner based on my day experiences.
 Great cappuccino and muffins. I'm a Mom with young kids and I LOVE the play area. The play area gives me hope that I can have a nice meal put with my kids."}
{"text":"Great to see The Porch Light serving dinner now! Great flavours and loved the portions. We will be back! 

Try this little Gem.  It's a great spot the food and deserts we're great.  

Being freshly open I am confident the wine list will grow, but that's me a wine snob...."}
{"text":"The coffee is pretty good, but the service is slow and the prices are high.
It's not advertised as fair trade or organic, so I'm not sure what's driving up the cost. 

There are plenty of tables to park your buttocks and connect to some free WIFI. There is also a play area in the back for young children, which was a pleasant surprise. It's basically catering to rich beach moms and their  young nannies. 

I'd like to see them use fair trade organic and offer some decent food, which is not yet the case."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new dinner spot on the east end and came across this place. It was a Tuesday night and it was mostly a local crowd. Great cozy, neighbourhood feel to the place! Between the 4 of us we shared 2 starters and 4 entrees. Loved the mussels - perfectly cooked and we made sure we sopped up every last bit of the sauce. Pork chops were juicy and mushroom risotto was cooked just right. Nothing to fault except that they didn't have a printed wine or cocktail menu yet."}
{"text":"The Porch Light is my favourite coffee shop in the east end! They have amazing coffee beans which makes fantastic cappuccinos, a great baked goods menu, and is a fantastic place to drink some wine and share a meal!"}
{"text":"A lot brighter in person, the Porch Light is the perfect spot if you're hungry but need to get some work done. Igot the arugula tuna salad for around $12.00 and then a cup of (refillable) coffee. Beats the pre-packed snacks at Starbucks any day"}
{"text":"Best coffee in the east end without a doubt. Ambiance is great and I look forward to checking out their new dinner menu asap!! This place is exactly what the upper beaches needs -- keep it up!"}
