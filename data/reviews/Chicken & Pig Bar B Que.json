{"text":"All fareness, I had the ribs and chicken and it wasn't the good, and wasn't horrible. What was missing like traditional BBQ, was the smoke flavor. Meats were boiled cooked, and grilled on a stove, rather than a wood, or Charcoal Grill. It's definitely no authentic BBQ."}
{"text":"Man.. I should've read the reviews before I came here. Chicken and ribs are ok.. nothing special. It the corn on the cob tastes like those microwaveable frozen corns from the grocery store. The bread tastes like paper and the mash potatoes were gross. Never going back."}
{"text":"I would recommend for no one to ever eat here. I bought three of their wing plates today and two hours later my mom and I began vomitting. Just do your self the favor and save your money and your stomach."}
{"text":"If you are only going to serve barbecue, you better at least get it right. This food was poor quality across the board. The mashed potatoes are from a box mix without any gravy, the mac and cheese is just overcooked noodles with no cheese that I can see. The BBQ steak is tough and the cornbread is basically a hockey puck.  We couldn't even finish it, it was so terrible. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the same place that is on the Mortons Truck stop on Losee and Cheyenne. Went in today and had the chicken and rib combo with Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. The rib was very small but not bad tasting. The chicken was not cooked all the way. The Mac n Cheese must of been dry because they put NACHO CHEESE on them to make them look fresh! REALLY?????? The mashed potatoes were horrible with no flavor at all! I guess this business won't be around to much longer!"}
{"text":"I usually get the pork ribs or BBQ chicken which are good for the price.  Decided to get the hot links tonight , ended up with 2 hotdogs, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was so happy a different type of food place came into this neighborhood after being bombarded with Mexican food all around these parts it was nice to see this bbq spot was open.  Stopped in for lunch only 2 people had orders in front of me, the place seems clean.  Ordered the BBQ pork sandwich, which on the advertised pic was pulled pork with slaw on top looked delish. I chose the mac n cheese & Cole slaw as a side. Unfortunately the sandwich was nothing like the pic. The meat was chunks instead of being shredded and was absolutely disgusting because of all the cartilage/ tendons, it was more like tendons with a side of meat which is a pet peeve of mine nothing I would willingly pay for. Also there was no slaw on it, there was lettuce, tomato, pickle and mayo just not a good combo. The coleslaw was missing flavor and the mac n cheese was mush. Very disappointing back to tacos I go..."}
{"text":"IN all fairness they gave me my money back! So at least they seemed to feel remorse. Also I was told this was the cooks fault-so based by my photo and the horrible tastw-yes they need a new cook!"}
{"text":"went back and got the nachos, no where near as good as last time, i dont think I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is ran by don tor taco and is the absolute worst BBQ you'll ever eat in your life. Honestly."}
{"text":"I should of known by the name alone that this place was gonna be terrible I mean who names their bbq spot chicken & pig? The pictures of the plates and meals looked terrible as well we definitely went against our better judgment here, I mean we walked in the door and the cook even had a look on his face like are you sure you wanna eat here? I definitely 100% do not recommend humans, chickens, cows, dogs or pigs to eat here. Save your money go to smith's across the street buy your own chickens and pigs to cook at your house and you'll get get a better outcome."}
{"text":"Went in today for my first visit. Got the pulled pork sandwich . On the menu it has pulled pork and coleslaw in the picture . I got a chopped up pork sandwich with tons of pieces of cartilage then had lettuce ketchup mustard pickles and jalapeños. Took one bite and had to pic the cartilage out of my mouth almost pucked .macaroni and cheese was dry seem like it had been sitting and mash potatoes were soup.. 
such a shame would be nice to have a local BBQ place that was good."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Why is there only 1 star? Just because they're not FANCY? Cmon now...

Very reasonable prices for good BBQ. And I've been to TONS of fancy places and this place is just FINE if you want basic BBQ with quality sides. Try the baked beans, mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob. The pork ribs are great! Hits the spot for your BBQ craving!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken and ribs bbq! It is so good! Their kalbi ribs were good too. 

Now their breakfast menu, I'm sorry but it sucks. Their waffles I believe are eggos and came out from the toaster, their eggs weren't good, I ordered for bacon and they gave me ham and they left an opened butter packet inside my to-go box. 

I would order their bbq menu but not their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered a Cheeseburger. Who puts jalapeño's on a burger and doesn't ask the customer if they want them. Took a couple of bites and mouth was on fire only to realize they were on the burger.  Also ordered the pork sandwich which was so so.  On the whole we were disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Employees are great but the food isn't. It doesn't taste like it's fresh. It's very dry. Even the mac &a cheese. :( pictures had gravy but informed me they do not have gravy. :-/"}
{"text":"This is not a BBQ joint. It's crappy, leftover cafeteria food. Never come here. It's like a Robertos or Don Tortaco's of BBQ. You can tell by the menus, the decor, the employees clearly don't know how to actually BBQ, and obviously by just how bad the food is. 

Pulled Pork Sandwich- more like fried crap. Do not even attempt to eat. It was made on a flat top burner. 

Mashed Potatoes- flavorless. 

Corn on the cob- mush, flavorless 

I took three bites of each, threw the rest away and left. Awful. Please close down immediately.  You're singlehandedly giving BBQ a bad name."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place. Its no wonder why when you google the place it says PERMANENTLY CLOSED. No matter what you order  chicken, pork, or ribs they all taste the same. Too expensive for small portion that is not that great."}
{"text":"YUCK!!!  We spent over $30... Ordered the pork nachos, pulled chicken sandwich, and the chicken and rib combo. The nachos were slimy, the pulled chicken sandwich had chunks of rubbery skin, and the chicken leg seemed par-boiled with no grill marks at all.  Unfortunately, when walking to car with our two bags of food, two customers walked out with us stating it was the worse BBQ they ever had.  Do not recommend at all.  So sad, we were hoping for a great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating here. Tonight I bought the Barbecue Family combo, and it wasn't so great. It came with ribs and chicken, and choice of 3 sides. The chicken and ribs actually weren't half bad, but every one of the sides was dreadful. The cornbread was rock hard, the mac & cheese totally flavorless, and the crinkle-cut fries were so sad. It was like the quality I would expect from a school cafeteria. 

Save yourself the trouble, and just get some barbecue from the grocery store. It will be of similar quality, if not a little better."}
{"text":"I totally forgot to review this place. I ate here months ago. We were visiting a friend in the area and he wasn't home yet so thought we would grab a quick bite. What a mistake. I'm over here again and just remembered. I thought this place would be closed down by now.

I don't know how to even classify this place. It says BBQ but it's more of a bunch of random things, no theme. I wasn't feeling their BBQ so ordered the buffalo chicken wings. It was frozen wings from a bag. The person behind the counter didn't even know English but attempted to take my order. I told her but then another lady who knew slightly more English had to take my order again. When I got my chicken, it was still red inside. I felt sick to my stomach because I already had eaten a couple. I threw my napkin on top and was done. There was no point in complaining to people who couldn't understand you. I just vowed to never go here again. This place was the worst establishment I have ever been to. Please save yourself the time and money. I wish I had checked Yelp before coming here. As bad luck would have it, the only time I didn't, was here."}
{"text":"Tried here for the first time tonight. Should have known that I needed to walk out the moment I saw the \"B\" health rating hanging by the cashier. I work as a manager for a restaurant that does over $20mil in revenue a year and I know that B ratings are usually not horrible you can get them for a reason of stupid reasons suck as our hot water taking more than 10 seconds to heat up, or if there isn't a proper sign hanging somewhere--- but seeing as how the place is tiny, if they were able to get a B, I assume they just don't care about their guests or their establishment.

Ordered a chicken leg/thigh combo. The \"creamy\" coleslaw was dry. Like literally bone dry. No dressing at all. The mac and cheese was... okay. Not horrendous. It's supposed to come with 2 rolls and I only got 1. The rolls not a big deal, just thought it was funny.

Ordered a side of mashed potatoes as well. When they gave it to me, the potatoes weren't there so I told them it was missing. The girl apologized and went to go get the side for me... except she gave me more mac and cheese. Not potatoes. So I told them again and they finally gave it to me after they had me open my box to make sure there's not potatoes inside already... they just made it and there was no one else in there... I'm pretty sure you'd remember if you put potatoes.

To the chicken-- it tasted like they grilled it and just finished it with BBQ on top, nothing else. It was so basic. The BBQ sauce had good flavor, but it kinda tasting like store bought... which thinking about it now, I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the gas station next door and got some.

Will I return? Maybe if I'm THAT drunk. But I doubt it. Avoid this place and save your money. I doubt if this place will be open much longer"}
{"text":"This place is nice dried chicken, frozen but nice. It's  a side kick for robertos. Smith has better BBQ chix. I hope yelp doesn't remove my post because every time I right a negative they always says \"This is not a right comment\" . So the food here terribly fine. Excellent non taste dried chicken slathered in BBQ Sauce on top. I saw people come in and leave without ordering. But really wonderful place."}
{"text":"Awful, plain and simple.  Same issues with the sandwiches.  Seriously who dresses BBQ like a hamburger... The menu lies as well don't rely on that.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Our chicken was raw, Mac and cheese was dried out and the mashed potatoes were flavorless and watery.  Ribs had a good flavor but just \"meh\". Our kids ordered burgers and they were super peppery, fried hard as a hockey puck and unedible.  No reason to return."}
{"text":"Saw the other reviews after we were there and they are correct. Hamburger wasn't cooked all the way through.  Mac n cheese was dry and tasteless, coleslaw is blah!!!!"}
{"text":"We knew as soon as we walked in, not to eat here. But we had a case of buyers remorse as the place was empty. 

I got the pulled pork sandwich, which turned out to be more like chunks of fat burger with same sauce on it. It had lettuce, tomato, onion and tons of ketchup and mustard, for a bbq sandwich...uhh?

my boyfriend had ribs, which we saw come out of the freezer. 

Don't waste your time or money here. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Probably the worst b-b-que place I've ever been to. 
Let's start with the service: a kiosk would have had a better personality. No hi, good morning, nothing. Not even thank you for your order, or a sorry when I got your order wrong - Nothing 
We should have been warned when we asked the cashier if the food was good - he said it was ok - great confidence in your food. 
But, it's about the food. So, ordered the combos:  1 hot links, 1 steak, 2 orders of the chicken and ribs. 
The hot Link: it was a a HOT DOG cut in half and put on the grill to get the grill marks on the outside - BUT the inside of the HOT DOG was COLD -that take skill. 
Next: the steak: flavorless, cold, beans colder, rice was old, the roll was the best part. 
Finally: chicken and ribs: chicken very dry, ribs; seem to be warmed up and bland. The best looking dish I saw come out was a burger and fries - that definitely was made Fresh. 
Very disappointing and definitely will not return. This place has no personality, neither in the personnel or in the food."}
