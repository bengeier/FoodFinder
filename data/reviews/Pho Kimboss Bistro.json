{"text":"I recently visited Kimboss for dinner with a group of friends and had an excellent experience! The restaurant is clean, well decorated, serves food on real china dishes (not worn out plastics bowls and plates) and quality, round chop sticks. All of this, plus the owner is such a sweet man! You can tell he appreciates your business and wants you to enjoy your experience. He even gave us an order of his delicious grilled jerk calamari with mango on the house! 

His pho broth was well flavored - some of the best I've had in the city. You can tell he uses quality ingredients. His spring rolls (meat, deep fried) were plump and flavorful. The shrimp and chicken pad thai was loaded with both, as well as plenty of veggies, with an authentic (tamarind)  pad thai sauce (not the disappointing ketchup-heavy kind). 

I will be a regular visitor to Kimboss.  More people need to find out about this new little gem of a spot. Once you visit, you'll understand what sets this restaurant apart form the crowd!"}
{"text":"Recently my partner and I visited PHo  Kimboss Bistro for dinner.  It was by happenstance. After visiting a neighbor pho restaurant a few doors down, we  decided not eat there when we learned that 1.  They put MSG in their dishes.  2.  They insist that they cannot put  MSG from their dishes.  Fair enough.   In the end, we were very happy to walk a few doors down the street to try this very charming restaurant.  We were greeted by the owner, who turned out to be this amazing cook.    He was also lovely and welcoming as the host and server. Even better, the food turned out to be equally yummy and charming.  I had the vegetarian noodle soup, which was delicious.  I asked if he cooked with msg and he said no because everything is home cooked and it definitely tasted home made and not packaged.  My partner had the grilled chicken.   When we inquired about the tea, he graciously provided us a bag to take home while providing us with  fresh squeezed orange juice and fruit.   What a lovely restaurant and we are glad it is not far from home.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"For the first time, I'd say I can't wait to return to a pho place not because of the amazing food, but the hospitality and the charmingless of a pho restaurant. 

Cute decor, round wooden chopsticks in individual package; Vietnamese music, AMAZING tea, cute teapot, Spring Rolls on the house; individual dipping sauce. It's like you stumbled upon a Vietnamese household and you are the owner's old friend. By the end of the dinner we were also given sweet sliced oranges and persimmon . This is by far the best pho experience i'd had."}
