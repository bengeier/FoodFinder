{"text":"\"All you can taste\" - Great aesthetic of the restaurant let down by indifferent service and hit-or-miss dishes. I recommend Riz on Bayview as opposed to this Riz North location - the Bayview one has much better food and service."}
{"text":"Second time here and it was horrible. Bad service. We waited half an hour for anyone to acknowledge us and give us a glass of water. The food was awful and funny tasting. Our server was absent for most of our visit. At one point, she was more concerned with dragging a wet mop across the carpet and mopping the front entrance. We won't visit here again."}
{"text":"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE BY FAR  If I could give 0 stars, believe me I would.  The sign outside says \"17 dollars\" in gigantic font and \"or up\" in barely legible print. They also did not specify to us first-timers that the dinner menu, though serving the EXACT SAME FOOD as the lunch menu, would be twice the price.   The food was subpar at best. Our yam tempura was cold and crunchy... fairly obvious signs of a poorly cooked yam. Seeing as teens working their summers at The Exhibition can do it, I would think deep-frying would be a difficult thing to mess up. But with careful effort to be careless, every fried item on the list was uncooked. High prices do not necessarily mean high quality, demonstrates Riz, through their lack of authentic flavour, or any flavour for that matter. Bland and over-sauced, my friend and I were unimpressed.   Going against the clich√© saying \"it's QUALITY, not QUANTITY,\" Riz consistently was able to deliver neither throughout our courses. As we were conveniently uninformed at the beginning of our attempted dining experience, you only have an hour and a half to eat as much mediocrity as you can.  However, nothing could have left a worse taste in my mouth than the service. When I ask a server for a recommendation, I do not mean to ask a recommendation on my portion size. The three different servers we had were careful to 'suggest' when we had enough on our plates, so to speak.   Continuing on about their service, I would suggest you are careful in reading the menu. Reading \"all you can taste\" does not make one aware that it is \"all you can taste if you can catch a waiter\". Left and right the waiters scurried, their destinations seemingly everywhere but a table, most likely in order to run out the clock on your precisely timed eating.   Our dinner was charged with an extra hour, which was as you can guess infuriating. Not to worry though, we washed down our anguish with a pitcher of water that had been angrily slammed onto the table after a half hour of not being given a single thing to drink despite our polite requests.   For our underwhelming party of two, gratuity was included, which probably eliminated the incentive of doing a good job, or merely their job at all. I rarely find it acceptable to not tip at a restaurant, however the extra fees for left overs and surplus hours would have been just cause had it not been slapped on for us.   It's fortunate Riz makes twice as much money on one meal, because I would never come back a second time."}
{"text":"Visited Riz North with high expectations. Maybe the bayview location is better but I did not believe that two blocks would make much of a difference. My husband is gluten intolerant and we went specifically for the Gf menu. Unfortunately, the Gf items were not clear on the main menu. After a short conversation with the server, and going through a few options that couldn't be made Gf she finally offered the take out menu for GF items. This was mildly annoying but we were reassured that the bayview location has a dedicated GF menu. The take out menu was much better and it was nice to see that GF items did not always cost extra.   We were a table for two and we ordered one appetizer and two entrees. Plates were notated as GF which is a nice touch, similar to what they have at Pf Chang's. The GF chicken pho was lack lustre and came with two sause containers but no explanation as to whether the sause were GF. The bowl was not marked GF which did not instill 100% confidence but husband had not reaction after dinner. My meal selection was not GF friendly, and while it was delicious.. It was expensive. $10 Spider roll with four rolls.  We will likely visit again as there are not many GF friendly restuarants (Asian cuisine) to try the all you can taste menu for a special occasion."}
{"text":"My favorite pan-asian all-you-can-eat. Thai curries, Sushi,  Dim Sum, and Pho all in one place."}
{"text":"I went here last night as a last minute plan.  I was so excited that I was wearing black and white, because I completely matched the decor.  I agree with other Yelpers that the ambiance is nice (though loud), white (the colour, not the people) and chandelier-y.  It was really hot in there, which may or may not be normal.  If it is, then I would not suggest eating here because I was boiling.  I also agree that the menus were old and cheap looking, but found that the content was all over the place.  They really have a large variety of everything and nice sized wine list.  Thumbs up on the vegetarian options.  The table ordered: -Edemame) hard to screw this up) -Vegetarian Pad Thai (nothing extraordinary) -Green Curry Coconut tofu w/veggies (on rice, very tasty) -Avocado and Sweet Potato tempura UFO (it's shaped like one, but a full-on tempura) -Sweet and Sour Chicken (sweet and tasty) -Sweet and Sour soup (yummy)   For dessert they offer a combo of traditional Asian desserts and chocolate cake-type options.  Overall I was satisfied, but mostly because the company was great.  I would go here again if I was taking a client out or meeting colleagues for dinner, but would not make my way here because I crave a particular dish."}
{"text":"The flavors of their food are good.  But I am giving them only 3 starts based on their all you can taste menu.  Their portions are not all you can taste but rather huge.  You can really only order a few dishes rather then taste a bunch.  It makes no sense, if you ordered off of their regular menu you would save about 50%.   They mentioned better value, but that is not the case.  Stick to the a La Carte menu and you will be happy and save a lot of money and have leftovers.  They don't let you take the leftover from the all you can taste, what a waste."}
{"text":"The owner of this place does not seem to care at all of its customers. All I can tell is how they used up heavy species to cover up the half spoiled food. Go somewhere else and don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Riz North. There were 5 of us at 7:30 on a Friday night. It was very busy but the service was spot on. We opted for the tasting menu which gives you 80 choices and allows you to have a small portion of anything on the tasting menu. All you can eat. And!!!! We had two guests who are gluten intolerant and the restaurant was able to accommodate beautifully. They even had plates with the words \"gluten free\" written down the side! We also had a pregnant woman who was experiencing some 'food aversions' and they worked with her on that too. On to the food - fabulous! Everything was delicious. And I'm not exaggerating. Everyone at the table loved everything. There wasn't a morsel of food left on the plates. And the wait staff were great at making suggestions of things we should try - which impressed me because they were quite busy. The atmosphere is lively and loud which is what we were looking for. Green P parking is close by. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Be careful what you order, they over charge and to top it off, they charge a 15-18% \"service charge\" on the total bill on top of the tax! Read the menu and be prepared to pay more than advertised! Waitress are nice but the manager, short Asian with big micky mouse glasses is very rude."}
{"text":"All u can eat menu is very expensive. Service is dismal and you are charged automatically for  15% service charge whether you get it or not. Why am I charged 15% service charge when there is absolutely no service??"}
{"text":"First time here and totally loving it!  It had a fantastic selection of gluten free dishes.  We had egg rolls, crispy beef, Singapore vermicelli chicken & shrimp, beef & broccoli, thai green curry chicken, sushi rolls, and green onion ginger crab.  Every dish was so delicious and beautifully presented.  The staff was very friendly and the food came out quickly.  Not to mention that all-white decoration is so chic and contemporary.  We would definitely come again soon. Highly recommended if you are a celiac and looking for fine dinning in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not worth the money or the time to go there.  We had a reservation for 7:30pm - stood and waited until 8pm before they seated us.  At 8:37pm I finally went to the manager and said could someone serve us - we have been waiting since 7:30pm!  She didn't apologize or get someone - she just said \"I've been busy in the back someone will come\".  Don't waste your money - the food is mediocre at best - you can get the same food anywhere.  There is absolutely nothing about this restaurant to make you go back - save your money!  They shouldn't be in business - rude, rude service!"}
{"text":"Well-this is a new revised review.  We went there for dinner against my wishes, BUT - THE FOOD AND SERVICE WERE OUTSTANDING! Had the tasting menu.  Everything was fresh, hot and tasty.  The service was  genuinely  friendly beyond expectations.  So good for them!  Will go back to eat or get takeout again!  Good to see that people and places can change for the better!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, clean, white  on white, contemporary \"fancy\" but not too cool.  Service was fine, nothing special but not bad.  Veggie appetizer plate was okay - not very generous but fine. Hot and sour soup was weird - sweet and (black) peppery and not very hot (temperature)  Cashew tofu was a very unattractive dish - overcooked fried tofu tossed with brown goopy sauce and a few, hard to find cashews.  Vegetarian pad thai was basically a heap of rice noodles tossed with some kind of ketchupy tomato sauce. A few slices of celery mixed in and a couple of squares of tofu.  Curried vegetable dish was okay but bland and not very generous.  Fried banana, split in half lengthwise, was soggy and lukewarm.  These guys need to hire a chef."}
{"text":"Two of us had lunch and not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the tablecloth (totally stained on the sides) topped with a paper placemat that had obviously been previously used, paper covering the chopsticks was filthy.  Service from greeting to leaving was slow, despite the restaurant not being very busy.  Food came out in drips and drabs.  Hot and sour soup not spicy at all, wonton soup tepid at best.  Har gow was gummy, Pad Thai over cooked.  Only pleasing dish was the cashew chicken.  Not sure if we would go back again...maybe try the Bayview location instead."}
{"text":"My father is almost 70 and walks with a cane. when he picked up take out for 5 people (lots of bags all tied together) he asked the gentleman (he thinks the manager) if someone could help him with the bags to the car parked literally right out front. The response he got was \"no I cannot\"  Not \"no I'm sorry sir I cannot help at this moment\". Not \"I'm sorry we are very busy sir\"   What a rude and disrespectful employee who clearly doesn't value the customer.  On top of it all the food wasn't even good. There's much better Asian around!"}
{"text":"The food tasted fine, but it wasn't exceptional.  The sushi rolls were sloppy.  Though there are tons of Pan Asian options, nothing seemed authentic.  They have tons of gluten free options for those looking. Perhaps better suited for take out given the poor service.  Nearly all white decor with sort of shabby chic looking chandeliers attracts a more affluent crowd for sure.  The former host & co-owner of nearby Cravings Restaurant seems to have split with his business partner and moved here.  I was appalled that after we (husband & I) were seated at 5:30pm in an otherwise empty restaurant then served beverages that we were asked to move away from the only window seats to another table because they needed to seat a group; being from the industry, we politely obliged without so much as a fuss.  It turns out we were simply displaced by 2 women without a reservations who literally whined until the host gave them our window seat.  We were virtually ignored.  We had to top up our own wine & our water was not refilled.  When asked if we wanted dessert, we said we'd like to see the menu.  We were miffed that the waitress returned with our bill instead?!  So, we can take a hint.  We were not under dressed or did anything embarrassing to deserve this treatment.  From the looks of other reviews, this is the norm for service, so be aware before you take an important client or special date there.  Parking is a problem.  There is no street parking on that block on Yonge Street, so you are limited to 1 hour free parking on side streets, meter parking 1-2 blocks away or Green P parking behind Super Pet."}
{"text":"Had a working group lunch here today and I was impressed by how much food ended up on our table but in hindsight I am still mixed. I totally agree with Lawrence T's opinion of the crispy beef. You nailed it and I couldn't say it any better. Coconut curried chicken was easily the best dish. Phad Thai had excellent shrimp and chicken. Mango salad was amazing too. I've had better convenience store sushi, please don't ask why I know this. In a nutshell we had a good experience where too much food was served and they accommodated our group quite well."}
{"text":"Would never return. Overpriced for what it is and staff are unfriendly. I would be concerned with level of sanity as well as a consumer.."}
{"text":"We chose the all you can eat menu. It was absolutely great! Wonderful food and plentiful at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering anything from this restaurant. Ordered take out... asked if they had veggie fried rice as I didn't have a menu. I was told they did. After picking up my order I grabbed a takeout menu and noticed that it shows many different versions of veggie fried rice, but when I called I was not asked what version I preferred. I was simply asked if I wanted gluten free. Expecting to see at least one of the versions listed on their menu (with chili, cashews, and/or light soya sauce) I was very disappointed to open up my order and find steamed rice (not fried) with the tiniest (and I mean TINY) bits of broccoli and possibly some cabbage which was too small to make out. Definitely NOT what I ordered, and for $13 a pop (x 3 orders) for a grand total of $39 and change this was a huge disappointment. Would have returned it had we not been so hungry. Lucky for me my husband is a great cook and he fixed it up in order to make it palatable. Mistakes happen but when I walked into the restaurant there was not one person in it. No clue what their excuse was for not clarifying what kind of  veggie fried rice I wanted (since they have so many options) and why mine looked nothing like any of the ones the menu (except of course for the price). Will not return. Too many better options out there at a much better price....this may be closer but the added 20 minutes to go get the real deal elsewhere will be worth it."}
{"text":"Why open an all you can eat restaurant if you can't handle it.  After a few orders the owner actually asked the waiter no to take any more orders.  Not worth it.  she actually cane and insulted us.  The food isn't that good any way"}
{"text":"Great place to go to for some Asian cuisine - they have a nice sushi menu, pad Thai, Chinese themed dishes, etc. Definitely recommend it!  Service can sometimes be a bit slow, so you need a little patience for that. But the food and especially the tasting menu is worth it!  Ambiance - 4 Food - 4.5 Service - 3 Price to value - 4"}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience. I called to inquire about gluten free options to ensure that it legit was as I have a severe allergy. I wanted to make sure it was a separate gluten free frier. I was answered by a very very rude and unprofessional person over the phone. Instead of answering politely to my question if you are really gluten free? Which only requires a kind yes or no. He repeatedly said shouting \"I got you! WHAT DO YOU WANT!!! Repeating in such an awful manner. I will never ever order or be so disrespected! There are many places that offer gluten free options in Toronto! Why would I ever settle for mediocre food and terrible service! Disgusting!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not my first visit and certainly won't be my last! Riz always delivers. The food is reliable and tasty and I prefer this joint to rival Cravings down the block.   Lemongrass soup is a home run. And I get cravings akin to those of early pregnancy for their Thai Green Curry.   I would also recommend the Crispy Beef, and the Pad Thai is pretty good too. Also a nice Mango Salad for $5.  For the price-point, any reviewer awarding less than 3 Stars must be insatiable.   Service is quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"To be honest I was a little disappointed that we were dining at this location rather than the original Riz on Bayview. We came to Riz North for a family dinner with out of towners and they treated so we had no qualms as they ordered dish after dish of Asian Fusion fare. I had a couple favorites here and there. The ones that stood out were the veggies dishes. I'm not a vegetarian nor do I have any dietary restrictions, but the vegetables dishes were pretty tasty. The sushi was pretty standard fare...but the tuna stood out favorably for me because it melted in my mouth. Yum!! I like that Riz caters to many patrons with diet restrictions like vegetarians, and celiacs. A lot to choose from. Service was okay. We had a large party and we were pretty satisfied with the pace the dishes were coming in. Would I come back here again? Probably not, I wouldn't pay this much for sushi when I can get it somewhere else without the hoopla and the high expense! But it was an experience."}
{"text":"We are a family of 5: 2 adults and 3 young kids. The restaurant looks good and the food is decent with gluten free options but all this meant nothing with the very poor quality service at this restaurant. Not sure if it was the owner but an oriental women with very short hair ( looks a bit male) rushed us in without a smile or greeting and throughout it was quite difficult for us to get any of the waiter's attention to order things. At the end, the bill came with already included service charge of 15% which was quite surprising since we should be given the opportunity to tip according to our satisfaction of the service provided. The same male-ish looking waiter commented that it was standard to charge this for 5 people..we were 2 adults with 2 kids and an infant..! We refused to pay this and this waiter/ manager became emotional and threw our receipt at our table..left a very bitter taste and will never return to this place although we live down the street."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude service. A group of young women,  we spent $375 for dinner.  They brought us two pots of tea without us asking for it so we thought, like in many Asian restaurants, the tea was complementary.  They then kept asking if we wanted more, and we said 'sure'.  Little did we know we would end up being charged $50 for the tea!!  The food was delicious, but the attitude and demeanor of the staff soured everything."}
{"text":"I don't know who these people are that have trashed this restaurant!?  This is my families favorite restaurant.  Half of us have gluten issues and half do not.  The gluten free options are so good, that people who can eat gluten are happy eating gluten free.  This is unheard of.  One of my daughters suffers from  a very serious level of Celiac and she has never had an issue.  We eat a huge amount (all you can taste) and come out feeling full, but great!  For people who suffer from food allergies and sensitivities, that is also unheard of.  I think that the people who wrote the harsh reviews must be the competition as we have been there multiple times and never had an issue of any kind.  But then, we are nice people.  There are people who would never be satisfied no matter what."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here. Being allergic to gluten makes good Asian food hard to come by. My favourites are the sweet and sour chicken and pad Thai, but I have tried many other things and everything has been SO great!  I usually do take out, but the restaurant itself is lovely!"}
{"text":"Riz on Yong is a CERTIFIED Gluten Free Restaurant that is 100% SAFE for Celiacs but more importantly provides DELICIOUS dining options that are hard to find - like crispy shrimp tempura - dim sum and fried options! The TASTING menu is the way to go - suggested by our incredible and kind server Veronica - it allowed me to eat my way through the menu, trying a variety of items with out having to pick just one thing. TOP CHOICES: - shrimp tempura - because it's crispy! Hard to find! - coconot peanut chicken - creamy, smooth and FULL of flavor with no gluten OR dairy - used a coconut milk base - dim sum - delicious rice or bean based wraps - seaweed salad - because why not! - spring rolls - husband loved these, but I am not a fried food person, so these were not my favorite Veronica was attentive to my needs and checked in on me frequently offering insight on what to pick next CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK - three hour drive was worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a weekday lunch, and ordered from the \"All You Can Taste\" menu. Great to see they had so many veggie options. Service was standard - attentive and adequate. The food was just \"okay\" for the price. I don't think I've had a worse pad thai to be honest, but the other items I tried were pretty good. The lemongrass soup was delicious, the spring rolls were crisp and hot, and the green curry was a nice blend of hot and sweet. The veg maki was just maki. Nothing too exciting, but the black rice was a unique touch.   One thing I would recommend, if the \"powers that be\" are reading, is to perhaps increase the plate size. It's very difficult to eat any of the entrees out of the tiny serving plates, and the side plate they give you is also too small. I found myself picking at my food to avoid making a mess, rather than just digging in like I wanted.   Overall an \"okay\" experience at Riz North. I won't rush back but would probably come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"this is one of the restaurants i've been to ever hands down. whether you need to eat gluten-free (they have an extensive and authentic menu dedicated just to gluten-free items) or not, you'll love this place. the ambiance is absolutely beautiful and all the food tastes fresh. even better, the owner of the restaurant truly cares about your eating experience. 100% try riz if you or a loved one eats gluten-free or even if not! THE BOMB"}
{"text":"I hate writing a review not based mainly on a restaurant's food or ambiance, but I had a very unpleasant experience here and it was mostly related to their confusing multiple menus, and especially the rude and disrespectful way the manager dealt with us.  But first the food:  The dishes my girlfriend and I ordered were acceptable, but nothing more. Curry singapore noodles were greasy and overly salty. Red thai curry with chicken was tasty, but also too salty and the coconut rice (advertised as jasmine) was overcooked and mushy.  The ginger honey iced tea was tasty if expensive at $4. Our appetizer of vietnamese veggie spring rolls was flavourful but greasy. It had taro in it,  which has a mealy texture that for me wasn't working in the spring roll context.  The decor has been accurately describe by others here. It's white, and clean with some modern and classy touches. However the settings aren't complimented by either the middling greasy noodle stall food or the cheesy instrumental disco playing over the hifi.   These are but trifling issues. The real problem with this restaurant relates to their confusing and misleading menu system. We walked in based on the lunch menu pasted in the front window. It showed most of the dishes such as the curries and singapore noodles for around eight dollars.   When we sat down we were given a small menu with no prices. We found the dishes we wanted and asked the waiter. He explained that we had the \"all you can taste\" menu, which is a fixed $18 for as many small dishes as you want. Seeing it was lunch, and we were looking for a reasonable meal (not $18 each) I asked if we could have the same dishes of the lunch menu. He said that would be fine.  The food arrived fairly quickly and the portions were quite large. I didn't think about it again until the bill arrived and the prices were much higher than on the menu we'd seen in the doorway. We ended up with a $40 bill. At least $10 more then I would have thought.  When I inquired with the manager on the floor why there was this discrepancy, she said that we'd ordered from the \"all day menu.\" I asked why the menu on the door was so much less and she said that was because it was the \"combo\" menu, which includes a drink but smaller portions. That was what I saw advertised as the lunch menu, and seeing as we got there about 1:30-1:45 that would be what I would expect to be ordering from.  The hitch came when we were given the \"tasting menu\" then asked the waiter for the same dishes a la carte, and he took the liberty of ordering us the most expensive, \"all day menu\" versions.   So to wit, the restaurant has three menus (at least, who knows if they have more) and no one explains this to the diner -- at least not in our case.  The manager was defensive and rude off the bat. She said \"we've been doing this 20 years, and it works for everyone.\" Thereby denying that there could be any confusion or onus on the restaurant to be clear about the different menus and pricing options. When I said the waiter could have explained this the manager responded that they \"can't read people's minds.\"  She was utterly unapologetic, and knee-jerk dismissive. It's the type of response I expect from someone engaging in what I see as purposefully misleading pricing. I would have forgiven the waiter for not explaining everything, if they had been a little bit accommodating and understanding, or maybe acknowledged that things could have been clearer. Instead I was made to feel like I was remiss in not understanding their byzantine menu system.   Well good job Riz. You have mislead me right out of your restaurant, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Decently priced for an all you can eat lunch, or prixe fixed lunch. Lots of gluten-free options and veggie options for all you can eat. I wouldn't say this is totally authentic Asian if that is what you're looking for. Taste-wise our all you can eat pickings were decent but not anything 'wow' worthy.   Service was good, and our water cups were attended to. My only gripe is when the waitress took my credit card, she picked the 15% tip option on the machine herself. Fine, I'll deal with the fact that gratuity was automatically added, and that requirement isn't listed anywhere on the menu... but this was a weird practice. For that, I won't be back here and take away a star from my review."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family on Christmas Eve. We had a tremendous amount of food; Mango Salad, Crispy Beef, Tempura, Drunken Shrimp. Everything was decent but with a ton of salt or sugar. My aunt enjoyed it because it was all gluten free. I am leery of \"Pan-Asian\" places that try to do too much and end up doing everything mediocre like.    7 /10"}
{"text":"It was a bad experience and I don't want anyone to have such a bad experience like me here!! Pls read it!! \"It's enough!\" That was the waitress said When we were ordering!! and ended up with...\"you know right that you could order more later!!\" Was it nice to say that?  Anyway, my family came after and ordered more food and drinks. After that she was gone and not even came back to check on us if we needed anything. however, We got none of our drinks except tap water!  There were 3-4 staffs around there at that time and it wasn't busy at all. But it seemed like they didn't want more customers. I forgot to mention that we chose all you can eat. It cost $30 plus 15% gratuity. We were quite a big table..9 people but it wasn't enough for them to care about. They just kept talking and walked pass us many times.  I have many questions for them but they might not be interested to listen. You're not a cheap restaurant but your service was cheap. If you don't care about serving food and taking care of your customers, how you're supposed to have good business. We brought you $300 but you guys acted like it was nothing. You were rude to us by ignoring and you knew it. I was sure that you guys knew that we were disappointed but you said nothing. I just want to know if it's your policy to ignore your customers. Why're you still doing business if you don't have service mind? This is Toronto and we need good restaurants with good food and service!!  Don't cover your bad service with a nice decor! It's not enough!!! Such a bad night for me and my family!!!  Go somewhere else if you don't wanna have bad mood like this!!! Awful awful awful!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good for the most part- shrimp sticks, crispy calamari, crispy beef, salmon sashimi, green curry chicken, black bean beef, mango salad, bok choy were all really good. I personally didn't like the shrimp in lobster sauce and lemon halibut. Ambience is really good, prices are good for location and feel of the restaurant.  Service by the waiters who work there was excellent but the owner was horrible. This was my first time meeting a nasty and quirky owner who is racist and did not smile or give a warm welcome. He also gave us a \"friendly reminder\" that there is a $2 fee for left over food (as though we hadn't seen his fine print on the menu).  We ordered a few items from the tasting menu which is supposed to be AYCE but the owner was trying to restrict how much we ordered all because we returned two items that we genuinely didn't like---what is the point of a tasting menu if they force you to eat items you didn't like??  When I said to the owner that this is the first time that I've experienced ordering restrictions at an AYCE place, his response was \"we all learn something new everyday\" LOL what a joke. If you are caucasian you'll be treated like you're God otherwise don't have high expectations from the owner if he happens to be there. He didn't end up charging us the $2 for the items we didn't like because we put him in his place...O and he also mentioned that they have cameras for a reason i.e. to record people who don't pay the $2 surcharge for leftovers lol Joke of the year!"}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner. We love the all you can eat menu because you get to try small portions of whatever interests you on the menu. We all enjoyed the food and the staff was great. the only reason why I am not giving them 5 stars is because they were missing a few of my favourites on their menu which is available at their other location."}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu lunch. Thoroughly impressed - had the $17 tasting menu and everything was really good. Even the sushi (spicy tuna roll) was good quality which I know can be tough with such a diverse menu. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Our whole family agree that RIZ N is pretty awesome. This is unusual because generally the younguns never agree on anything. Great variety of asian cuisine.  I strongly recommend a reservation as RIZ N seems to be full all the time, even a Monday night.   This of course is a good sign for asian food."}
{"text":"Riz North serves up very mediocre to poor quality and tasting food in big portions in a beautiful setting (especially the two story arch room in the back).    Decor: modern white, with classic touches is pleasant but also shows a lack of total cleanliness and dusting. Every restaurant is probably the same, but the shiny white decor does the beautiful restaurant a disservice.   Service: The servers were attentive, helpful, and friendly, and the food arrived promptly and as ordered.   Food: Big portions of poorly prepared bland food. We ordered the Singapore Noodles (a curry spiced noodle dish) and it was so far off of what a true Singapore noodles tastes like that it should bear the same name. Spring rolls were well made and delicious. Spicy Crispy Beef was sweet and crispy, but tasted like something that could have come from a food-court fast-food Chinese restaurant. The chicken and cashew dish looked really good, but was quite bland and lacked enough chicken (but had a ton of fresh vegetables).   Additionally, I found the menu weird...so many items can rarely all be cooked well. The menu had Chinese, Japanese, including Sushi, and Thai. I will not be rushing back to the place, but I must be in the minority as the restaurant was busy, and it is actually the second location within Toronto."}
{"text":"Thoroughly love the experience of the all you can taste dining. Will go back as many times as possible.   A delight for sure."}
{"text":"My weekly go-to because of the Celiac kitchen. I never have to worry about getting sick and everything is delicious. I've taken many people, friends and family alike, none of whom could tell the food was gluten free. Truly my favourite place around!"}
{"text":"I ate hear last week for a work dinner.   The food is basically a slightly higher end Manchu Wok/Food Court type of place but in a nicer setting.  None of the dishes were terrible. None were delicious. Not a place I would go myself. Leaving the restaurant, I would have given it 3 stars.  However, I got food poisoning the next day along with at least 5 others in our group (of 15 total).  So...1 star it is. Wont' be back."}
{"text":"Great all you can taste menu. Very fresh and always busy. The crispy beef is awesome. Reservations are a must on Saturday night. Very high quality for all you can eat"}
{"text":"Always a favourite in my books. I typically come on off hours so I can't comment on service during peak times. Service from 4-6pm is quick and fresh. I love the gluten free all you can taste menu. The spring rolls, tornado rolls are crispy and hot enough to burn your tongue. There is gluten free soy sauce and hot sauce that comes to your table. The ginger tea is always warming. I recommend the crispy beef, the spicy green beans, the har gow, the gf sushi pizza. I haven't not liked anything on the menu. It's a great place for a good filling dinner. I have had a large group book this place for dinner. The management gave us a server dedicated just to us so we didn't have to wait around. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for work, we had a group dinner here with about 18 people.  They served a tasting menu of sushi and appetizers, along with several entrees.  The food was surprisingly good, and the service was good.  This was highly recommended by a local fan, and I've made a bookmark for them for my next visit to Toronto.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and dishonest with their pop refill policy. Waitresses don't really tell you prices at all and never state that a soft drink refill will cost you $2.50 for a half a glass of ice!  Automatic gratuity of nearly 17% also didn't make me happy because I half-wanted to tip 0% after finding out only on the bill that our pop refills weren't free.  Would have made a scene and asked to see the management were it not for the friends we were with.   Definitely not for the budget-conscious. Will just go to Mandarin next time."}
{"text":"We were a party of 15, which understandably it does get frustrating and confusing for the waiters.The service at first was good, but after we got our food it was almost like they forgot all about us. We had to reorder a few dishes that were forgotten and they gave us attitude about it.  They charged $24 for green tea, so watch out with that and I believe they also charged for hot water and a lemon.....  Overall the food was ok, but the experience made me not want to go back. Ever.  Oh and they don't take debit cards!!"}
{"text":"The food here was decent. It was enjoyable and tasty and they had a large selection. The server here was very kind and she made our experience wonderful. Our friend was having his birthday and she brought us our cake and even cut and served it for us. She was very quick and we didn't even notice her clearing our empty plates away. We had the pineapple fried rice,  green Curry,  and the Singapore vermicelli. All of which were delicious. I didn't try their buffet but I would love to try it next time. Food was 3/5 but service 5/5.  Ps. They should have properly marked washrooms. Both unmarked and doesn't distinguish between male or female."}
{"text":"Best gluten free Asian restaurant in Toronto   I absolutely love Riz for it's gluten free food. I can't disagree with other comments that the food is pricy and the service is alright. However, I go there for delicious gluten free Asian food that doesn't really taste gluten free  because it's so wonderful. I'm a regular there and always order gf shrimp tempura, haw gao and sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm overly critical but my experience was pretty bad. The food quality was food court like. Service staff were brisk and dispassionate.  Atmosphere was okay but a little frantic. After two attempts I'm not going to return, which is a shame since I live so close and prefer gluten free Asian foods."}
{"text":"Once again the yelp community has nailed it again! We love going out for dinner. The ambience at Riz is truly great. They fall down on service and value for $$. I will go back to Cravings - great food/price/service. The place is pretty, but we want more than that.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a long time!  Horrible service from a team of inept servers.  Took us 5-10 Minutes to be greeted. Another 20 minutes to place a drink order. When i said we were ready to order drinks the only person we could flag down was more concerned with taking our drink menu away to bring to another table instead of actually taking the order.    Food was mediocre. Small sized, bland tasting Dumplings. Sushi portions were very small ($12 for 4 pieces of spider roll instead of the usual 6-8 pieces elsewhere). We were still hungry when we left despite a large bill for our group of 6.  Staff was concerned with doing odd jobs like changing the paper on other tables vs providing quality service. Restaurant was noisy.  Just a disastrous meal from start to finish. You can do much better! Avoid this place"}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn on my overall impression of Riz North. It has a pretty even tie of pros and cons, and while I wasn't overly disappointed, I wasn't amazed either - so we'll settle at 3 stars here. I went for a family member's birthday on a Tuesday night, so any reviews on service or wait time may be biased to that fact.  The pros: As everyone above me has mentioned, the decor is very appealing. The fabrics are all white and the trimmings are glass/crystal, and gives off an overall classy and upscale vibe. Our waitress was fairly knowledgable and was able to recommend dishes to suit everyone, and the wait time for our meals was fairly standard. Though we made reservations, the place was about half full and it wasn't too loud.We ordered thom-yum soup and lemongrass soup, and while I'm usually a fan of salty food, the soups were a bit too salty for my liking. The spring rolls were hefty (ya know, sometimes they skimp on the stuffings) and delicious in both vegetarian and meat varieties. I could have filled up on those alone.  The cons: We ordered 2 different noodle dishes (singapore vermicelli and udon), chicken teriyaki, thai basil beef, and cashew chicken. The portions were very generous, that's for sure! But once again, WAY too salty. The beef was probably the least salty of the meats, but the noodles were almost unbearable. The chicken dishes were flavourful but i kept tasting the salts instead of spices.   We didn't order dessert, so I can't judge.  It might have just been my palette- but then again, maybe not! I would be willing to come back and try some of the appetizers and vegetable dishes to see if they are more tolerable than the meat dishes. But if you're looking for a WOW place for a special occasion, I'd look elsewhere just in case."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing food outing experience I've had since diagnosed with celiac (10 years ago). Nice upscale atmosphere with very speedy service. I had the gluten free all you can eat dinner and I got to enjoy delicacies I had not gotten to enjoy in over 10 years. Things that you could never typically get gluten free were made gluten free with ease and were DELICIOUS, coming from an entirely separate gluten free designated kitchen for no chance of cross contamination! Things like crispy beef, sweet and sour chicken, breaded lemon haddock, spicy salmon rolls, shrimp tempura, crispy spring rolls, beef and broccoli, black tempura maki, dim sum -- all FABULOUS and satisfied what I had felt missing from my diet being gluten free for all these years. I left STUFFED and smiling from ear to ear. The manager spoke with me and brought out a specialty dish as a recommendation that was delicious as well. Great experience and i will 100% be back. My parents are not gluten free but got the gluten free all you can eat as well and enjoyed it thoroughly as well, they found everything amazing. You definitely get your money's worth at this place.  Huge variety of delicious food for every person's tastes."}
{"text":"Riz is one of my family's favourite places to eat.   The service has always been top notch, and a lot of attention is put on the experience and making sure that it is safe eating experience for people with food issues.  The variety of foods is exceptional.  I had sushi, Thai, and Vietnamese food.   They also offer Dim Sun.  I ordered off of the all you can taste menu, so I was able to try several different dishes.  I especially like the Satays.  An interesting thing about Riz North is that they do not serve pork, and every dish can be made gluten free.  This is an exceptional find.  I had sushi with the crunch, and I wasn't limited to 4 or 5 dishes.  Every thought has been put into place to make this a great dining experience: beautiful dishes, fine furniture, well decorated and seating for close to 150 people.  All of this, and am upstairs party room that can handle 54 people for special events."}
{"text":"Went for the all you can eat.  It is tastefully decorated.  The food is tasty.  The ingredients are Good.  The best thing is that they have an extensive Gluten free menu.  Yes!  Certified Gluten free and on well labeled plates.   I think I ate too much."}
{"text":"This is a strange but appealing place- kind of an upscale dim sum restaurant for the Yonge & Lawrence crowd. It's much larger than the surrounding restaurants and offers the most ridiculous set of menus. After a long day of work it is disconcerting to be confronted with all the paperwork you must sift through just to order. I've posted a photo of what it actually looked like. We ordered the tasting menu. The appetizers were just ok, sushi pretty good, and curries and pad Thai very tasty. For an upscale all-you-can eat it's pretty good and we'll be back there."}
{"text":"We ordered through UBER eats. Had the spring rolls, pad Thai, tofu and cashews and chicken.  Chicken and tofu was really good. Pad Thai was HORRIBLE, and was missing steamed rice and spring rolls. Called and spoke with the owner as there was items missing. She said it was sent and the video shows it going into the bag, but it was not there. I asked about the steamed rice and she said\" I don't care about the steamed rice at all\".  So rude and average food = never going to order from here again..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that serves all you can eat Gluten Free Asian cuisine, Riz is for you.  They even have dishes marked Gluten Free as well as Gluten Free soy sauce.  The sushi was as good as any other all you can eat place - just more expensive because of all the additional items like Thai Curry and Dim Sum items.  Many items like Tempura, Siu Mai and Har Gow are on both menus, so they make the Gluten Free version for everyone.  Unlike most AYCE, you place your order with the wait staff item by item, not on a form.    Highlights were the Mango salad, Red Curry Sauce and Yam Tempura sushi.    Low points were the rice that came with the Curry - cold and hard Jasmine rice and the Coconut Sticky rice was mushy. Also, General Tso Chicken and Crispy Beef are cloyingly sweet with no spice, but half the tables had little kids so perhaps that's why.  For the weekend price ($32.99 for Gluten Free AYCE and $30.99 for regular AYCE), I thought there would at least be green tea ice cream or fruit for dessert and there was no way we were going to pay extra for a scoop of sorbet, would rather go for some fresh gelato.    They also charge extra for tea per person so if you don't really want it don't say yes to it.  All in all, if it weren't for the Gluten Free option, it wouldn't be worth the trip to Yonge and Lawrence especially for the price."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was awful. Only good thing about this place is the decor of the restaurant.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"My wife had ordered take out and when she got the food, she discovered they had given her the wrong food. They were rude, dismissing, and insulting when I called them. They refused to own up to their mistake, getting into a he said she said argument. When I explained to them that my wife ordered the food this morning and because she is admitted to hospital (trying to avoid bad hospital food) and I am upset with them, the manager told me that she should come down to the restaurant so she could show the sushi chef how she would like the food made. Extremely poor service, and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. Yes Riz you are one of the prettiest Asian fusian restos around, think Moroco Chocolat chandaliers and Frenchified styling meets Spring Rolls gweilo-fied menu, however the service leaves me a little skeptical.  The service was congenial in the beginning with the ever enthusiastic host ushering us to our table but from there on it goes downhill.  Don't get me wrong we were served quickly and efficiently, but when presentation is key as evidenced by Riz's gorgeously plush surroundings the service should be less dry and one dimensional. In truth the service felt more like I was at some run of the mill Asian eatery in an obscure strip mall in Markham versus at an upscale fusion restaurant Uptown.  Also the menu should be more elegantly laid out than some poorly kinko's copied mess of laminated pages, with both the lunch and dinner menus all mashed up together.  I will credit that at least there is a fair amount of vegetarian items offered on the menu.  Having said that the food was actually quite good in that Asian food created for a Caucasian palette kind of way. To start my husband and I order the Mango soft roll which is bland and forgettable then the Avocado salad with ginger sesame dressing which was great.  Hubby orders the Drunken Garlic Lobster which is wok fried in lemon parsley butter, smoked garlic & white wine along with fried rice in a crisp rice bowl shell as he devours it like a lion devours it's kill on those Nat Geo documentaries.  Scavengers take heed!  Myself, I have the Crystal chicken lettuce wraps with minced chicken, shrimp & chunky rice seasoned with hoisin sauce and am very pleased with the crispy little rice bits textured along with the flavourful deliciousness.    The facilities which is a trek up a narrow carpeted flight of stairs is simply stunning and feels like a little boutique of a lieu, a word of advice though, the sandpaper-esque toilet tissue was NOT a classy touch given how beautiful everything else is.  Upon leaving the lieu you'll pass by the private party room, which is pretty exceptional with a mod mural of a light installation and nouveau Asian decor flourishes.  It'd probably be a pretty neat place to throw down a shindig of sorts.  The clientele is mostly seniors/caucasian families gathering for an \"Asian\" style dinner. I will suggest to try to secure reservations at Riz north as by the time we left about 8pm the place was gangbusters with a line-up about 20 people deep waiting to be seated.  I will give  Riz North 5 stars for aesthetically beautiful surroundings, a 3.75 for the food and a 2.75 for service.  Yes, Riz north is somewhat of a gem but until they fine tune and refine some of their kinks it's just cubic zirconia trying to pass for diamonds."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many soso reviews!  The new sampling menu is incredible.   Great selection.  The food was always hot and fresh.    Their normal dishes are usually too big.  This new menu is awesome.    Definitely recommended!  Get here before 730 to beat the busy rush on the weekend."}
{"text":"For the first time in a review, I'm not sure where to begin.  Walking into the restaurant was surprising.  It was spacious, clean, classy, and obviously Asian-ran.    My mom had a company dinner and they rented the second floor for the occasion.   The space is somewhat cramped for 40 people.  The food came quickly and I was sooo excited to try the sushi.   Food: 1. The sushi was so overhyped. They use a lot of rice and you can barely taste the fish. It was like biting into riceball mixed in with slivers of veggies and fishie.  2. The chicken skewers I loved. The peanut satay sauce was perfect.  3. The curry was amazing too. Although their roti was super oily.  4. The green beans were good! It is an oily dish but acceptable.  5. The dim sum was surprisingly average for the amount we paid. If you're looking for dimsum... Go elsewhere.  6. Other dishes that I can't remember due to insignificance.  ~ The food, overall, was either average that met expectations or fell sorely below.   The kicker honestly was the employee. My mom was showing her friends the new $10 bill for Canada's 150th and this middle-aged male waiter was like, \"Can I see?\"  THEN HE HELD ONTO IT.  I grabbed the other end cause noooo way was this happening. We already tipped you?! Then he has the audacity to ask my mom, \"how about I keep this one?\" And although we were all laughing, we knew he was being serious.  When my mom's like: haha noooo. Him: wow, \"yut jeung do mhh bey?\" Which literally means, really you won't even give up one? Thank god these were her close friends and not anybody else from the company around.   Awks. Manage your staff better please. The food isn't horrible and I do love the setting."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so bad here... Came here a few times before but this time was for my sisters \"congratulations on your wedding\" dinner. We had a table of 15 people! The service was great! Good food but not that great size portions for the price.. especially when there are so many of us and 1 dish goes so quickly!  Really recommend the sweet black crunchy chicken- not sure the name of it. But we ordered like 6 plates of it!  For dessert they only served hot tea no coffees.. Kinda disappointing I love my cappuccino!"}
{"text":"First time going to Riz North, is the last time going to Riz North.   While the interior is nice with white decor that cannot make up for the low quality of food.  It tastes as though it was preheated in a microwave--you know that taste when you pre-heat rice or a meal and you can tell its from a microwave--where the outside is warm but the inside is cold? Yeah just like that.  Moreover, the waitress forgot many of the things we ordered off the menu--and we were there at around 3:00pm when it wasn't busy. The teriyaki chicken tasted as though it was again preheated in a microwave and the tasted too dry.  Be careful to ensure that they don't charge you for tea--they charged 3 people at our table for tea and we did not even know it!  I live in the area and I was really looking forward to having a place nearby to get food, but unfortunately it did not meet our expectations.    After I tried a few things off the menu, I was ready to leave...hungry."}
{"text":"Watch out for sneaky waiters who include gratuity into your bill and then try to add an additional 20% tip in from your credit card...  Food is below average. Went with the tasting menu. The quality of the appetizers was very disappointing, tasted like something you'd expect from a school cafeteria. One of the worst pad thais I've ever had. Mushy and ketchupy, almost inedible.     Service was worse than the food.. If that's even possible. I've never experienced service so slow and sassy... the staff are just plain rude. Stay away from this place if you have any ounce of self respect. Just disgusting.  Such a shame, it's a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst, most hostile service I have had at a restaurant in a very very long time. Possibly the worst. After the first few dishes ordered, the lady serving us basically cut off our group of 7 adults and 2 children.  We had to apologize for asking for additional food. She would interrupt us in the middle of a request and said she had to tend to another table, several times. Waters were never topped up. Half of our requests were fully ignored. In the end we had to hunt down someone to try and pay our bill to get out of there. Never going again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I've been coming here with both friends and family for years and always tip generously. Today at lunch I asked for the change back (I gave a $20 bill, and the lunch special was $14.68) and one of the owners (Terry Wei) came back with the change after about 5 minutes of running back and forth to other tables while ignoring us, and said \"you can tip however you want but if you don't tip good then next time we will turn you away\" as someone who always tips this aggravated me to no end. I won't be coming back, and left no tip this time. The fact that the service was terrible and no one came to ask how the food was, or fill up the water, is enough to warrant no tip anyway - but I still would've had it not been for the extremely rude owner. Not the first time he has acted this way either. Steer clear of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just walked by here with a friend and went in for lunch because the sign outside said all you can taste for $17. It was 4pm and the host said they close at 3pm and I would have to have dinner which was $29, way more than what I was looking to spend for a quick bite. I mentioned my reluctance and he said he would serve us lunch but it was significantly smaller than the dinner menu. Whatever went for it because at that point there was no one even in there and I was starving. Super fast and tasty but I do think it was because we were the only people there. Don't get teriyaki or sushi pizza (I know right?) and be careful how many deep-fried dishes you order because they come large unlike the delicious maki. The decor was very nice, so much white, marble tables, chandeliers. Daytime everything just seems so chic. $6 drinks. yellowfish maki. crispy tao chicken"}
