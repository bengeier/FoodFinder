{"text":"This place is OPEN!!!!!!  Just stopped in last week on Friday, December 18, 2015, and had a great meal!  Super friendly server and wait staff and good food.  Don't know who said this was closed but it had been another restaurant in the past.  Reasonable prices and soup and salad bar.  Nice inexpensive family restaurant."}
{"text":"I and a partner have eaten here twice. The first time for lunch was so good we came back for dinner a couple of weeks later. For lunch we both had standard Mexican fare, fajitas for me and burrito for her. Both were very good, but it's hard to make either exceptional... or lousy for that matter. Our waiter was obviously not a pro, but he was friendly, helpful and competent. Dinner was a super experience. My partner had the shrimp and rice, which was seasoned perfectly and portion was HUGE. I had the Camarones Monterrey, which was superb. The shrimp were tight and flavorful, the bacon was crisp and not greasy and the presentation on a sizzling cast iron skillet was great! I want to point out strongly that if you're in the mood for Mexican and you're in Phoenix, Joe's is a waaaay better choice than Si Casa Flores at the Shoppes at Exit 24. The only reasons I'm not giving 5 stars is because the atmosphere is a little too casual-both times we were there, there was a table occupied by employees' children. Making your dining room a daycare center is not cool. Also, the service is, again, a little too casual. I hope Joe's makes it because I'll be back at least once a month."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Joe's numerous times. We always enjoy the food. I have never had a bad experience here. The meals are beautifully served. Always fresh, we would recommend this resturant to everyone. Very pleasant family operated."}
{"text":"Love this little diner. American & Mexican food. They have pretty good service and food is yummy. Great for the kids they are definitely a family oriented business. I love places I can feel comfortable with my youngins!!!!  And it's a plus they have bloody marys:)"}
{"text":"Decided to try out this restaurant after receiving a coupon in the mail. We were NOT disappointed.   The chili rellanos were made fresh wit a variety of cheeses and the perfect amount of sauce to accompany it.   My wife has the chiliquillas. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the chips and green sauce were so yummy. Love that they serve breakfast all day long.   We will definitely be back, especially for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation of a friend. Very good food, good presentation, reasonable pricing and good service. You won't walk away hungry! What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Very friendly people working there. Ive eaten take out about 4 times and been happy with my orders.I have had biscuits and gravy, eggs, hash browns, cheese burgers and fries. Recently had the huavos rancheros and it was very good. I think Id like some kind of sauce to make it a little more gooey but it was very good and Ill try more dishes."}
{"text":"My mom and I go here very regularly.  They have a nice salad bar that includes soup.  VERY friendly, caring owner and staff.  Their food is tasty.  They care if something is not to your liking.  They go out of the way to make my mom happy and comfortable.  They are open on Sunday just 8 to 2 pm but are open through dinner the rest of the week.  Have great lent specials including tuna casserole!"}
{"text":"Went to Joe's for dinner and found it very quiet on a Saturday evening. I ordered the pollo con arroz that came on a large platter and consisted of a bed of Spanish rice topped with strips of chicken, fresh green onion and mushrooms covered with a tomato cheese sauce and cheese. It came with three large tortillas. All together a meal for two unless you get a lot of exercise. The food was not spicy; in fact a bit bland. The ice tea, as is too often the case at restaurants, was weak and more ice than tea, but refills are offered."}
{"text":"What I like about this restaurant is that the service is just amazing! The restaurant staff is always very welcoming and nice to their customers--at least every time I go there that's what I see. I haven't tried eating here for lunch or dinner yet, but I do enjoy their all-day-served breakfast food. I really enjoyed their hot chocolate as well. The server told me it was a mixture of Swiss miss and a chocolate syrup, nevertheless it was great---makes it even better with whipped cream on top!   After reading the other reviews that people wrote, I did enjoy reading the one about finding a hair on their ice cream because at the bottom there was the comment of the owner of the restaurant. I asked  about that to hear what happened. Oh man, gave me a good laugh!   Overall, I'd recommend this place to family and friends. Also, it's good to support your local businesses."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Everything!  Food, atmosphere, service, prices!!!  Can't think of anything not great!  We'll be back!!! Our group ate the tostada lunch special with ground beef, chili relleno lunch special, burrito al carbon, chicken enchilada lunch special. All very good!  Would order any of them again!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch during a weekday. I had prompt, friendly service. The food was delicious and fast. I had a grill cheese which was Crunchy yet the cheese was perfectly melted. My French fries were crisp. Eating utensils were clean which is always great! The seating was good and I felt like family when I walked in. I'll be back"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place with 0 stars I would when my guest and I came in for the first time there was a very sick child in the back and she was running around the restaurant. To make matters worse I found a hair in my fried ice cream and when I told the waitress she took it away and sai \"I wont charge you\" then went to the back and came back out and said the manager said I can offer you 10% off your bill which was like 1 dollar and some change..I was applauld she never even offered me a substitution instead she threatened me with her mother who was the owner said \"you want to deal with me  i am much nicer\" after some back and forth with waitress explaining to her that is only right to comp me for the $4 ice cream and remove it from bill she then trys to tell me that the chef just got his hair cut and it couldn't possibly be his O.O then when I told her I was just going to call my credit card company and explain what happened and have it removed the waitress said if I did that she was going to call police over $4 item and something I didnt even eat!!!! So by the time the mother arrives all I wanted to do is just get out of there so I told her I would pay the 10% off and she made a motion of cutting her neck to somebody in the car...I dont know what she was planning but it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me in a restaurant ..I will never ever go back..."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, family owned tasty food!  I love the build your own breakfast option.  Lots of choices, and their hash browns are nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Ok, will do  always willing to give someone a second try. Will update this asap.  Well, tried Joes again to be fair in judgment. Won't be back. Still nor will ever be impressed with the food or the service. Too bad I can't support a local business with positive reviews."}
{"text":"Great burrito! Extensive menu consisting of Mexican and American offerings. Very nice/helpful waitress. Nice clean atmosphere to boot. Will be back to try more."}
