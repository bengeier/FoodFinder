{"text":"I went with the chorizo tacos. Very respectable tacos: good size, the chorizo is on point, served with a sunny side up egg on top. I'll go again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks and fantastic service. Must try the make your own guac. This restaurant was difficult to get into and I tried for months, but it was certainly worth the wait. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Very crowded night. Steelers playing. Had a spicy cucumber margarita. Fantastic, not spicy at all. Guacamole is really good. We ordered the mushroom tacos and the chicken tacos. Never got to the chicken, they are in my fridge right now. I would eat the mushroom tacos again and again. We love all the great restaurants in Pittsburgh, this is at the top of the list. Go there!!!"}
{"text":"This place has such a fun vibe, my bf and I both agree that this is our favorite taco place! Our server, Chris, was excellent too!"}
{"text":"täk? is a must eat in Pittsburgh.  Fancy tacos that leave you full and sated.  Their frozen drinks are worth the price!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambience! I found delicious vegetarian options. Really nice to have a live dj playing music. I went with my sister but it's a great place for a date too! My favorite appetizers were the beet tostada (sounds too healthy to be tasty) and street corn."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool.  Fish tacos are fresh but missing something in the taste.  Steak tacos were better.  Make reservations.  I would go back but not hurry back."}
{"text":"First of all, we were seated after 15 minutes of confusion and bickering between the hostesses. We were seated at one of the empty tables that they told other guests were reserved... for ghosts apparently. Once seated outside the server looked at us; coming in and out of the restaurant multiple times without even bringing water or saying anything to us. After being ignored for upwards of 10 minutes right outside of the front door and kitchen with our menus, we decided to leave. The food has been great on previous occasions, but the current service (and in particular the FOH staff) leaves enough to be desired that we won't ever be patronizing this restaurant or its affiliates."}
{"text":"After months of having Tako on my must try restaurants in Pittsburgh, my husband made reservations for us to go on my birthday. We were seated right away and greeted by an extremely friendly server. We had street corn to start and I had the yellow jacket cocktail and my husband had the lychee & pepper cocktail. Both drinks pleased our palette perfectly.  For dinner I had the mushroom tacos (being a vegetarian that was the go to option) and my husband had the al pastor tacos - simply put, amazing. Finally, for dessert we had the whipped cheesecake. After leaving we both talk about the complex food profiles of everything we had that made the food so one of a kind and desirable. We are looking forward to go back!"}
{"text":"Turned up on an early June night (as they opened the doors) before a Pirates game. Excellent spot. Went with the Korean tacos. Super tasty. Especially the fermented cucumber and the (I'm guessing) hoisin sauce that tied it all together.   As for cocktails, the grapefruit and sage margarita was excellent. I would have never thought of that combination, but that bittersweet grapefruit, together with the whiff of savory sage was excellent.   If you can, get there early, and try to get one of the six or so seats on the street where you can watch the kitchen work. I did, and it topped off a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely sensational. My mouth waters just thinking about the Kale salad.  The restaurant is casual and delightful, and the decor is fun.  I would have given this SIX stars except for the noise. The noise inside is unbearable. PLEASE turn it down.  It's the level of a dance club not a restaurant/bar and I feel like my ear drums were damaged. Perhaps the staff are all already hard of hearing?"}
{"text":"Tequila, tequila, tequila!!! Love the cocktails! Favorite would be the \"el Diablo\".. Bartenders are fab and friendly! Tacos are really delicious! They come soooo very close to the best tacos in the 'burgh, although I still believe El Burro holds the title of #1. Beyond the great food and drinks, the atmosphere is cool- the decor is on point!   For a great meal with friends, I recommend the queso fundido, street corn, chorizo and al pastor tacos, but honestly- you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!   So happy to have this gem in the city of Pittsburgh! I moved from NY and the Pittsburgh food scene here is -dare I say- better? I do hold a special place in my heart though for NY bagels and pizza :)   Please keep opening more great restaurants like tako, butcher and the rye, and meat and potatoes! My taste buds thank you! Well done."}
{"text":"We had to make reservations almost a month in advance for a Friday night, however, it was well worth the wait.   For drinks, we ordered a watermelon basil margarita and a diablo. Both were fantastic, but I preferred the diablo as the watermelon was very very sweet. Then, we started with the queso, which was creamy  with a little bit of spice. My boyfriend and I both chose the pollo asado tacos for the main entree. AMAZING!   The portions were just the right size and we left feeling very satisfied. Our server was very accommodating and knowledgeable about celiac substitutions as well. The ambiance is very unique and fun. Overall we had a wonderful experience and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Really great food. We made the reservation about 1 month before - we've tried to go two other times and not been able to get a spot. Totally worth it. The tacos were aaaamazing! Some of the best I've had. They hand make their own tortillas right in house, you can actually see them freshly being made in the front of house kitchen. Delicious! We tried a few different ones and all were good, so full of flavor. Cocktails were really great as well. The decor is cool, similar to the groups other restaurants but has its own flair. Server was super nice also. Dessert was a little on the heavy side and not my favorite but I didn't go their for the dessert so 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I love Täk?! The atmosphere is wildly awesome, dark and loud, not the best for conversing but fun in its own right! The wild mushroom tacos are incredible as are the signature Täk? tacos, which features octopus as the main meat! The grapefruit and sage margarita is refreshingly divine! Highly recommend for a cocktail afterwork or Friday night downtown!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Our waitress was great and explained everything very well.  She described all of our options and helped us decide between all the delicious drinks and tacos.  Everything we ate and drank was superb.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went here on spring break for a birthday dinner. Very upbeat place with a super cool vibe! It's impossible not to have a good time here! The food and presentation was good too! A great night!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! This place has a cool atmosphere and service is great.  I enjoyed the apps and my meal and drink.  I would definitely check this place out if you are in Pittsburgh.  Only downside was how you need reservations..Or your going to wait to sit at bar ..So call ahead of you can"}
{"text":"First: you need a reservation.  I had to plan almost a month in advance to get a reservation.  My boyfriend ate the octopus taco, and he said that he's \"had better.\"  (Yes, he has had octopus tacos before!). The slushy margarita was excellent.  My friend loved her Chorizo taco.  My pollo asada was pretty good.  The Korean was delicious, with some nice spice to it."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  Love the atmosphere and the taco's are the BEST anywhere!!!  Of course getting a reservation in a reasonable period of time is an issue but worth the wait and hassle.  It has  ruined any other taco place....LOL!!!   We take all our out of state visitors here when we can.  Keep up the awesome work.  WE love this place!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Food and Drinks were amazing, get the Tako Taco it is our of this world! The people made it from the Host, to the Bar Tender, to the other customers at the bar that moved seats so my wife and I could grab a seat together. Go here! make a reservation, enjoy. you're welcome."}
{"text":"The food was the stand out. The apps were our favorite part of the meal, for sure. As many have said before me, the corn and the wings were distinctive and just yummy. We chose the beef and chicken tacos and both were very good, but maybe not the best choices after such distinctive apps.  Next time, I will try something a little more exotic.  The drinks were interesting but approachable. The gin fizz was a great surprise, as was the iced strawberry-line margarita, with bits of fruit in the drink. Very nice touch.  When we arrived 15 min early for our 7:30 reservation, we were seated right away, Our server was extremely knowledgeable and with us at every turn, offering good advice. My only disappointment was minor and overcome by the good food and drink. The restaurant was cool and funky (love), but it was too loud to hear anything and too dark for me to actually read the menu. The décor was cool and I loved it, but a slightly lighter touch on the music and lighting would have made it a better experience for us and several of the diners around us joked about the same issues with us. That said, it was an older crowd on a weeknight, so perhaps that explains it!  But I'd go back in a minute, with my flashlight and megaphone - for the wings!"}
{"text":"Superb, great atmosphere and ideal for sharing!  A gourmet take on tacos!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic!  My favorite is the mushroom tacos and the elderflower/aloe cocktail.  I've never been disappointed.  The best is when the weather is mild and the outdoor bar is open.. the kitchen staff plays awesome music and their energy adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of tacos (including squash a duck), yet thankfully we made reservations! The lighting was a bit on the dark side. The guacamole was phenomenal, especially with all of the add-in's to personalize. Overall we had a great experience but again, reservations are definitely suggested as we have tried getting in before without and it has been a two hour wait."}
{"text":"Great vibe and service. Kudos as well for the outdoor seating / bar, which was amazing in good weather.  The menu claims to be inspired / based loosely off of Southern California. I can't say it completely hits the mark, but then again, that's a difficult standard to met in a location that's so decidedly inland and distant from either SoCal or Mexico. E.g. the fish in my taco (I got \"BAJA\") was fairly mild -- it tasted best when paired with salsa -- and didn't wow me with freshness. Similarly, the spiciness of everything (even \"hot\" salsa) could've been kicked up a notch.  That said: the combination of flavors, though milder than I would've preferred, was excellent. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. And as mentioned previously, the service was low-key but friendly. So yes, if you're far from the beach and craving a modern taco, this is a good place to come."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an incredible dining experience at täk?. Our server was very friendly and helpful. We started out with the guacamole with crab, corn and mango. It sounded weird, but tasted amazing! We also sampled their salsa and chips. It came with hot, mild and green salsas, and they were all tasty. Then, for our main course, we split three different types of tacos - the lamb, the duck, and the pollo asado. They were all good, but the lamb was our favorite. The meat was very tender and the flavor from the hummus and the tomatillo sauce was fantastic. I would highly recommend giving täk? a try next time you're in downtown Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've had the luxury of going to Tako twice now and I can't say I've ever been disappointed with the service and the food. I had the same server twice and she was very attentive in taking our orders and was patient when we had issues with deciding what to get and made wonderful suggestions for us!  The first time I went I had the Chorizo taco and it was the most flavorful, scrumptious, piece of taco heaven I have ever had. For the second time I had the Pollo Asado. It was a nice slightly charred piece of grilled chicken packed with all of the same other ingredients the chorizo taco had (minus the fried egg).   For the dessert we had the mint chocolate ganache. WARNING: the ice cream is very minty like the leaf. It's not your standard mint chocolate ice cream kind of deal which in my opinion is awesome. When it mixes with the dark chocolate and the blackberries it creates an odd bland flavor, but once it sits in it becomes somewhat of a masterpiece of flavors.  Also if you're wondering what the little dispenser is in the bathroom. It's a condom dispenser. We asked our waitress after having a 6 person dispute on whether or not it was a condom dispenser, a sticker dispenser, or a giant hoax that kept the customers in a perpetual state of curiosity, forcing people to spend the 4 quarters to find out the mystery.   Will definitely be coming here again to try out the guacamole and more of the delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything I had  -sangria + salsa/chips/quac and the tacos. place was a little loud but food was good and I will be back. PGH finally has a good taco joint!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is worth the hype about food. Each taco here is usually a fusion of flavors from different cultures which I usually love but to be honest, I don't think they paired the flavors well. It's not bad but definitely not even close to amazing.  The atmosphere is cool so I'd recommend coming here for the atmosphere and drinks, not the food"}
{"text":"4 stars because the taco ingredient options and combinations are amazing, as are the guacamole options, and the service. Not 5 stars because the tacos are served on flour tortillas (albeit homemade) by default, which really is a shame, but because the wait staff fail to mention that corn tortillas are an option.  And, \"We are still trying to perfect making our own corn tortillas\" is weak; it's simply not a priority."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and dimly lit. I also really enjoy their cucumber drink. However, the food is good, but not worth the prices."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late night snack and drink.  The place has a great feel to it.  The music was awesome.  We had poem belly tacos that were fabulous.  Definitely. Fun place to be with great food."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, in fact I never have. But this was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.   While sitting on the patio, my friends and I observed a man who we're assuming was homeless leave some possessions outside and go inside to (presumably) use the restroom. Immediately, our waiter noticed the pile of blankets and bags of bottles and asked us, the closest table, if it was ours. We said no, it was a man's who went inside. Within a minute there was a manager outside checking out what the stuff was. She picked up the bags and began kicking the blankets along the sidewalk in an attempt to move it away from the restaurant. She even went so far as to throw away his belongings and leave his blankets in a spot where people could step on it.   All of this was done not only in our sight, but seemingly to our benefit. I don't know if the manager and her staff thought we would like to see this treatment of another human being, but we didn't. It was awful. It was uncomfortable and cruel and showy in a way that suggested malice.  It was extremely hard to think about the meal, or carry on with our conversation after witnessing that. In fact, we debated paying for our appetizer and leaving because it was so baste.   The food was fine, but overpriced. The staff was generally fine but our waiter seemed to lose interest in us as soon as we said we didn't want drinks and the portions weren't big enough to justify the price or the hellish display.   I knew it would be pretentious, I had already resigned myself to that when I decided to go. But I didn't expect it to be demoralizing."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something. You are sinning right now by even questioning Täko. No review will do this place any true justice that it deserves. Go there. Now. But pack 2 diapers. 1 because when you walk in you will drop one from the shear sight of the interior. Your mind will try to make sense of it but you will fail and start to drool. It's like trying to understand the 4th dimension or the movie Interstellar. Your second diaper will be soiled upon biting into any 1 thing on their menu. It's like everything was crafted in the image and likeness of heaven. If my tacos were any more fresh, I'd be eating from the earth itself. This review may seem a little much, but then again you haven't been to Täko have you? Because you wouldn't be reading this and you'd already know. This place exceeds any expectations you've ever had in your life. Go now."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go to Tako for a very long time and let me just say that it was more than worth than wait!  Everything from the food (in particular the thrice cooked wings, queso fundido, and papa bravas) to the drinks (my favorite was the spicy cucumber!) to the atmosphere (dark, swanky with lots of personality) was perfection!  Can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"The Food was very good. I just wish I could see what I was eating. It's so dark in there. I guess Friday they have a DJ and it was challenging to hear the person next to you. Service wasn't bad. 2 tacos will not fill you up they are small but full of flavor."}
{"text":"Holy delicious tacos. I was not crazy impressed the first time we visited, but the last time was PHENOMENAL.   We came in as a group of 6 on a Friday night and were lucky that the bar cleared quickly, so we all sat and dined at the bar.  I love micheladas, and almost jumped out of my seat when I saw this on the drink menu. It was delish! Others in the group tried as well and loved it. Some others had the pineapple jalepeno margarita, and spicy cucumber- nice spice and delish as well.  The tacos- Oh. My. Goodness. The chorizo had a sweet taste to it, with the egg and other fixings, this taco was out of this world. Seriously. My mouth is watering as I describe this to you. The Korean, equally mouth watering. The flavor in this made me pause and say MMMMMM with each bite. Wowzer. I don't know what was different about the 2nd visit, but was SO much better this time. Can't wait to stop by again."}
{"text":"I love tacos and was not disappointed with the premium taco experience here. The restaurant has a fun atmosphere and a terrific staff.  Reservations are strongly suggested."}
{"text":"yummy! Still a wait for a table on Monday night at 8pm, so I took a seat at the bar. Tried the traditional guac, which was delicious, and the al pastor tacos, which were tender and meaty, with a wonderful taste combo. It's a dark atmosphere inside, but staff and bar mates were friendly. Would definitely return to try more."}
{"text":"Lime foam.  Roasted pineapple. Sesame mayo. Sushi grade tuna. Grilled octopus. These are a few ingredients that speak to the most imaginative tacos on the planet. This is an amazing place. Very trendy and very cool. Got to have a reservation if you are 2 or more. It could be really hard to get a table despite the sizable space they have. If it's just you then sit outside at the taco bar on the street facing the kitchen. Think street-side sushi bar but tacos. I came two nights in a row. Will likely eat here every night for the rest of  my week in Pittsburgh. I could rave about what I ate but the truth is it would not matter. Everything looked incredible."}
{"text":"Second time to Tako and I'm over it.  I certainly didn't appreciate having to wait almost 30 minutes for table after making a reservation nearly a month prior to going.  I will say the specialty margaritas are really good.  I went with the Yellow Jacket and it was delicious.  My first time to Tako I went with the octopus tacos, and the second time I went with the carnitas.  Both tacos are just way to over-seasoned and pretentious.  I can respect the thought of trying new things and trying to find that perfect blend of flavors, but it's like the recipe is trying too hard to impress.  Also, the construction of the carnitas taco was terrible.  Too much filling with the meat and fried egg and not nearly enough taco shell.  It was extremely difficult to eat and half of the taco ending up falling out of the shell.  For me, it's really not a place worth going out of your way for, and the food & atmosphere certainly don't warrant the challenge it is to get a table and a table ON TIME.  I'll stick with contemporary Mexican going forward."}
{"text":"Whoa.  Wow. Incredible.  Tasty. Delightful. Sheesh to service the food atmosphere and drinks.   Yes to it all !"}
{"text":"We came in for late night appetizers and drinks. Our reservation was ready sooner than Scheduled. We had the street corn, classic guac , queso fundido all were delish! Everyone had a variety of drinks and everyone loved them. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. They have a dj and the music was kind of loud but didn't bother me!"}
{"text":"Delicious but definitely make a reservation as far in advance as you can -- totally worth the wait and does not disappoint! The build your own guacamole was fantastic - highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Beyond the food, coming to Tako is for the full experience. The food is exceptionally unique. I definitely recommend the corn (appetizer), guacamole, and tacos (tako/octupus tacos!)  More on the experience- I especially love the music- the DJ's are all great. From the newspaper menus to the bike chain chandeliers, the decor is one the most distinctive assets of one of the most fresh and upbeat places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. We had guacamole (we picked the ingredients including smoked salmon which was a bit smelly), queso fundido, tako, and duck confit. All were delicious. Loved the herbs and vegetables in the tacos.   The drinks were OK. We had desert lilly (frozen of the day), michelada, and Ramon's gin fizz. Not much of alcohol in the drinks. Ramon's gin fizz was the best of all.   It's a bit dark there and smells a bit like food. No problem for me."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. However it is TOO loud. Maybe is trendy and I am getting old. I would love this place for take out."}
{"text":"Phenomenal on many levels. I have been here at least 10 times and they always hit the mark on food, service, and atmosphere!  (The drinks are pretty great too!) A must for visitors and locals - but book in advance, they are always packed! A number of guac options or build your own. Even if you aren't vegetarian, try their mushroom taco... it is incredible. For reference: I travel frequently and eat out at least 4 times/week."}
{"text":"Tako? More like Tak-Whoa! This place serves tacos and margaritas that are fancy. Our waiter was super cool. He was \"let's get this taco train chugging down the tracks to Faceville! Choo-Choo\" And then aggressively crammed a taco in my mouth. After that he pull a second Taco out from behind my ear like some sort of Taco-Wizard.   I recommend this experience  to everyone on the planet."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype. Tried twice. The decor is cool but the tacos are woefully underwhelming. Food lacks acidity and tends to taste alarmingly the same. It's a busy place and sadly the service reflects that with the typical malaise of high volume service folk. Last, a few drinks, 2 apps and tacos for 4 will set you back about $175. Bummer, moving on."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC FUSION TACOS: Food: 4.5 / 5 Drink: 4.5 / 5 Service: 5 / 5 Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: 5 / 5 Overall: 4.6 / 5  I've been to Tako 6 times because I keep going back to try new things and I love it every time.  FOOD: You can literally order any taco on the menu and you will not go wrong. Imagine a restaurant where every taco you order contains a conglomeration of succulent, juicy, and fine flavors that all come together to create a plate so perfect and extremely satisfying. This is Tako. The only thing not that special is their guacamole. My friends have said that my guacamole is actually better (I probably put more love and care into it).   DRINK: Some of their cocktails are quite sweet.  SERVICE: The servers/waiters are all quick, friendly, and knowledgeable.  ATMOSPHERE: Just like Butcher and the Rye, Tako is very loud and very dark. So, when you want to show your friends this amazing restaurant you will have trouble hearing them and seeing them.  PRICE: No complaints about the price for the quality of food and service here."}
{"text":"Great great food and service, nice decoration restaurant! We went there last Saturday night after a baseball game. It was pretty late and the restaurant was crowed, but surprisingly we did't wait for a long time for a table. We got shrimp ceviche for appetizer - really good, so fresh! For tacos, we go Carnitas and  Baja. Both are great! My all time favorite tacos are fish tacos, so I try fish tacos at every restaurant that offer them. The Baja-white fish here is amazing!! jalapeno lime aioli rocks! Our waiter Damian was nice, friendly, really efficient. We were happy being there and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Food was really good. It's a tight fit there and a very trendy place. It was so dark in there, I could not see the menu. I had to use my cellphone for light. A little pricey."}
{"text":"So I saw this on Cheap Eats and started to feel more then insulted, this crazed ultra-sympathetic West-Indian guy runs around and puts holy praise on all the cliche-modern restaurants that are very over-priced and are setting an unfairly high bar on the food industries pricing, sure it looks like it tastes good, but you get two small carnitas-style  - chorizo tacos with a simple fried egg and even simpler cilantro on top for $12.00 that's $6.00 each!!! outlandish! do you expect to turn a high profit margin based on the quality of your ingredients and greediness? Dude I can make these @ home for less then half the price! WHY? is everyone so stupid and why do they buy this? is it to Live to Eat, or to Eat to live? we need to go back to Eat to live, you waspy-elitest types suck."}
{"text":"Scored a seat at the bar and glad I did! Excellent food, fresh and full of flavor! I had some guac and the wagyu steak tacos, so good! Meat was tender and perfectly cooked, the toppings were creative and delicious. I love that there's more to the tacos then traditional toppings. An excellent creative menu with home made sauces, housemade chorizo...I can't wait to try the rest of the menu! And what made my experience even better was the open kitchen bar set up so I had the chance to watch the cooks in action which I love! Very energetic vibe from that crew, I had to take a picture :) I cant wait to come back to Pittsburg again, this will for sure be a regular stop for me!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. If you're visiting the city, täk? is a must-try! Make sure you make a reservation weeks in advance too, it's worth it. I've been here my last 2 visits to Pittsburgh and I plan on going back the next time I'm in town. Love the decor and feel of the place. I highly recommend the grapefruit & sage margarita! Get a guac of your choice as an appetizer. I've had the chorizo, korean and pollo asado tacos. All were freaking delicious. I'm dying to try the duck confit next."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was very good - amazing salsas with chips and cheesecake, although a little over priced. Atmosphere is loud, bar atmosphere, and it is difficult to hear conversation. Not a romantic spot, but certainly good for dinner before a show or game."}
{"text":"This place is amazing..  It was busy but we ate at the bar...  The service by both bartenders was awesome!  Would highly recommend the yellow jacket drink.  Ordered the flank steak tacos..  Prob the best I ever had!  To sum it up best food and service I had at a meal in a long while..  Gonna be tough to top it!!  This place is a must...  It is a lil pricy but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night fort dinner fort the first time finally! Have been wanting to try this place for some time. Very cool vibe. Live DJ spinning vinyl from a little booth upstairs. Really nice octopus decor including a wall mural painted by a local artist and octupus tentacle lights. Food was fantastic! Sweety corn AMAZING! Baja taco was my fav followed by the Tako and duck confet was good but a bit too much meat so was a little overpowering. The Tres leches dessert had apple caramel in it for a fall touch was really yummy. The coconut pudding was also very good tangy touch with the person sorbet. Can't wait to bring my other half here :)"}
{"text":"LOVE. Never had a bad drink or meal here. Cool atmosphere although a little dark for my taste. Mushroom tacos are amazing - the sauces create a very unique flavor. Sweet corn with chips is a good starter. Only complaint: I wish they were open for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended. We stopped in for an early dinner on the weekend. The drinks were really good, had several different margaritas and each was perfect. We ordered the Taco Big Board, six pairs of various tacos, which was enough for four people, along with an order of the chips and salsa. All the tacos were good, if my memory serves me well we had the Al Pastor, Korean, Tako (which is octopus), Carnitas, Pollo and Baja. All were great with distinct flavors but the one that missed was the Korean. Way too salty! I thought it was my taste buds, but I had two other people try them and they agreed. Maybe a one off, I have friends that have eaten there on numerous occasions and they rave about it. One final note, the music was so loud that day we could not hear each other talk. We all rushed through our meal and couldn't wait ti get outside. Maybe we're too old? But the food was good and drinks were on point. Definite visit."}
{"text":"I mean what can I say that hasn't already been said?  Possibly nothing but I'll review anyway because greatness deserves recognition.  Tako does it right in all ways in my opinion- service, food, ambience, location...but like most people have already written it's almost always crammed with people.  What can we expect when you have a smallish restaurant with all the goods?    A friend and I went before a show at Heinz Hall last night and though we attempted to wait list for a table we found it easier to grab drinks at the crowded bar.  Sooner rather than later people left and we squeezed in so we had somewhere to eat our ridiculously good mushroom tacos served on a sweet wooden board.  Yes, who knew?  Mushroom tacos were so meaty in texture and flavor, a little spicy too.  Afterwards you feel thankful that the World Health Organization put the kabash on processed meats bc you can live off these tacos for the rest of your life!  Ok and the drinks didn't disappoint either.  I had the aloe+elderflower margarita followed by the grapefruit+sage margarita.  Both were perfectly balanced, neither too sweet nor too savory/herbaceous.    Finally I feel like I found a taquería like the ones I've been missing since moving from LA."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had a great time. I highly recommend the Poké and corn appetizers."}
{"text":"We love going to tako for the food because it's the best, but we usually go in the summer and sit outside. Today we sat inside and were celebrating my husband's burthday, and the music was so terribly loud that we were screaming just to talk. Plus, there was virtually no light to see our menus. We had to use a cellphone flashlight to order. The service was super fast and the waiter was very nice, but the atmosphere was so bad inside that it will probably keep me from going back until the warmer months so i can sit outside."}
{"text":"There is not a single thing I would change about my experience here. Between the unique guac selections, expertly crafted cocktails, and fantastic tacos, the food/drink is all superb. I had no idea what I was missing in my life until I ate octopus tacos.  In addition, the overtly Hispanic Catholic (somehow both respectful and wink / nod) themed decor is outstanding, the full-view kitchen is boisterous and entertaining to watch, and the sound system runs an amazing playlist of 90's hip hop that I am very down with.  This is the best meal I've had in 6 months, and immediately became one of my favorite food joints in the city."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Tuesday night.  Make reservations!  They had tasteful rock music on the sound system (I remember hearing Tame Impala).  My meal:  Sriracha Street Corn Steak Barbacoa Tacos Coconut Tapioca (dessert)  All of the food was tasty.  Portions were appropriate.  Seasonings were well balanced.  I would go back."}
{"text":"This place was great. The food was delicious. We would definitely return. We loved everything we tried."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go if you want to have a good conversation - it was so noisy it was difficult to hear (the same can be said for all the restaurants in this group so it wasn't a surprise to us, but be forewarned). The tacos are varied and really delicious. My big gripe is the cocktails. I'm a huge tequila fan so I was excited to try some interesting twists. My first cocktail was supposed to be \"spicy\" and it barely had any heat. If you're adding jalapeno to a drink don't be timid. My second drink was, according to the server, not going to be too sweet but it was so syrupy I couldn't finish it. A big disappointment, and while we might go back for tacos we definitely won't linger over cocktails."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding! The Build Your Own Guacamole was very tasty (though a bit pricey) and the Korean tacos were amazing. The bartenders really know their tequilas and mezcals. I asked for recommendations and they asked how much I wanted to spend and what other things I like to drink. Told them I'd be up for something in the $20 range and that I'm a scotch and bourbon drinker and they hooked me up with an amazing mezcal.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We dined at Täk? before a show at Heinz Hall. Perfect location. Luckily we remembered to make a reservation (as it gets very busy). We tried the Poke for an app and it was excellent. I can't give any input on the margaritas, as I do not like sours, but I tried the gin fizz cocktail and it was very good! Don't let the avocado mixed in scare you.  We also had the chorizo and duck confit tacos. Both were good but the chorizo ones were a bit messy. Our waitress was great as well! Would definitely return.  The only down side of this place was that it was very low lit. Not a deal breaker, but just something to be aware of if you dine at Täk?."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious got the pork shoulder spicy and wonderful.  And the Baja fish taco crisp and fresh. Seated quickly, atmosphere is young and fun.  Great music. Ended night with fabulous cheese cake dessert."}
{"text":"I tried täk? over lunch today. Great tacos, nice atmosphere and great and quick service - I was in a hurry, and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. I'll definitely be back there to check their dinner menu and their drinks."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this Mexican fusion location.  Been coming for a year now and am rarely disappointed.  It's small so get reservations or plan to stand near bar to get a seat.  In the summer they have 5 or so seats  to sit at . 2 tacos a board. Great to go with a few friends as you can swap tacos as they are two to an order.  Cool ambience, fast service, good cocktails, creative tacos.  My favs are the papas bravas app( never disappoints)  Korean ( a must have) , El Pastor, and the Chorizo tako are good choices .  EL Diablo cocktail is also a nice addition to your meal .  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant!   It's worth going at least to see the decor and ambiance- it's a very cool!  The drinks were delicious and were my favorite part! When I was there, they had 2 different alcoholic slushy drinks, and I ordered one of those and it was phenomenal.   The tacos were very good; they look smaller when you see them on other's plates but are actually a really good size.  I also ordered a really good queso appetizer which was very good as well.   I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"First time at Täk? and was not disappointed! The atmosphere was moody and upscale. Felt like a cool restaurant you'd find on Bourbon Street, NOLA. The wait staff very friendly and knowledgeable. One of my favorite restaurants in the city! The duck confit tacos are a must!"}
{"text":"Very cool environment with a great bar. The guacamole and tacos we had were very very good. Great place to go but very crowded."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and it was fantastic! Started with the street corn which when in season is on the cob but since it's winter it was served in a bowl.. Made it great for sharing!   We had the first guacamole I can't remember what it was called. It was so good! Between those two my sister and I were full but we forced ourselves to try the tacos!   We tried the Korean and the Chicken tacos. I expected them to be small and not much meat. 100% wrong! They were extremely filling. We both preferred the chicken tacos. The Korean ones were a bit salty.  We also had two glasses of wine each and our bill was $90 with the wine making up $40 of the bill. We left stuffed and happy! Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"This place seems to get packed easily. We didn't have a reservation, so it was a free-for-all for bar seats. The host was super cool and made room for us at a table that was between reservations. Definitely over the top in costumer service. Wait staff was also great!  We went for the Pittsburgh Winter Restaurant Week Deal (Chips, Guac, red or verde salsa; choice of 2 apps; and choice of 2 tacos). The salsa verde (tomatillo) was rich and smoky and I definitely recommend. Other apps (guac, papas bravas, and ceviche) were also delicious. For dinner, We chose the Korean Beef BBQ taco and the Al Pastor Taco. Korean taco was very good, but the Al Pastor was fantastic!! I definitely recommend getting that one for sure! For dessert they had 3 options, but one sounded the most unique and we got that one (because why not!?) It was a chocolate bread pudding, with espresso/chocolate sauce, brownie bits sprinkled on top, bananas foster, and house-made Mexican chocolate ice cream... That was all in one dessert!!!! It was big enough to split (but small/good enough to finish even after a huge meal).  I plan to go back and explore the other taco options, because they all looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered a taco at lunch walking by and was pleasantly surprised. The wait was not long and the taco was very good and fresh."}
{"text":"We loved this place so much we strongly considered celebrating New Years here. Honestly, would have been satisfied leaving after the mane your own guacamole but followed that up with Chorizo tacos and couldn't finish it all. So much food. We made a reservation for 9 and was seated at 8:30! Go and you'll understand what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and drink good, but we couldn't have a conversation because the music was too loud."}
{"text":"Our meal at Tako was great as always, from the food to the service. We love the decor and presentation.  One suggestion would be to add a second vegetarian option that doesn't include mushrooms."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The drinks were very good. But the music was horrific. Really bad dance music. Loud. Bad. I guess I am not hip enough. This is the first miss from this restaurant group. I would get a taco from the street seats, but no way would I subject my ears to this place again. Wow. Did not expect this."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. The create your own guac is incredible. My favorite tako is the steak, but the fish taco is also absolutely amazing. But anything you order is en fuego. Lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Some of the best cocktails ever! I highly recommend the spicy passion fruit. Plus the tacos are delicious!!!! The Korean bbq and the chorizo have been our favorite so far!"}
{"text":"I went here for my dad's birthday with my family.  We all absolutely loved it!  We all ordered their specialty margs and were pleasantly surprised by the different flavors (some were even spicy)!  The guacamole is one of the best we have tasted.  It was very fresh and the chips were delicious as well.  Among my family, we ordered the Baja Tacos, Pollo Tacos and Scallop Tacos.  Everyone was pleased! We thought the baja tacos were a little bit sweet.  Overall, we really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere adds to the experience.  It is fun and eclectic.  Definitely planning on going again!"}
{"text":"Just a funky lovely place.  The food is simple, yet complex.  I sat outside on consecutive warm summer evenings and watched the happy kitchen crew create beautiful, fresh, eclectic food bursting with flavor.  They did this while having fun (except for the girl with the tattoo on her neck who only very rarely smiled unfortunately).  Most importantly, the kitchen crew loves to blast old school rap which for thirty something's like me is, well, intoxicating.   I even bought a t-shirt, enough said.    The only negative is the cramped quarters inside.  The hallway to check in with the hostess is very narrow and a high traffic area.  My elbow accidentally caught some boob on a lady who glared back at me like it was an intentional boob elbow."}
{"text":"To start, the ambience of this place is fantastic. There is a DJ in the booth, and the decor is fun. There is a wall full of any tequila to match your heart's desire. We started off with the papas bravas which were delicious. We ordered a bunch of different tacos - the duck was melt in your mouth good. We also had the steak and Baja which were equally as good. Our server was helpful and friendly. I'd come back just to hangout in the bar area ! Their drinks were phenomenal too. It was pretty cool seeing the chefs in the kitchen right when you walk in too. This place is perfect for a late night eat."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and the overall ambiance of tako is superb. Every taco we had was incredible, highly recommend the Korean and chorizo tacos!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Tako after it just opened a few days ago. A reservation is a must and it looks like you need to call ahead first as they do not appear to be on open table yet. This place is loud and by loud I mean that I could barely hear the person sitting right across from me. It was also difficult to hear the server and we were practically invading each other's personal space to place drink and food orders. The server was very attentive and very knowledgeable about pretty much every drink. I respect that because not every sever can recommend a drink based from what your likes and dislikes are. I started off with a Ramons gin fizz. Yes Ramons, not Ramos as we expected. It was served in a tiki mug and had a lot of ice in it. The taste was refreshing with hints of citrus and lime. Next, I ordered the aloe and elderflower, which had one large ice cube in it and was oh so tasty with just a touch of sweetness. The only good item that I tried was the queso. I felt it was gritty and had too much cilantro on top and was only served with three tortillas. Next time, I will be sure to order more food items and report back!"}
{"text":"If we are talking experience, atmosphere, fun menu, this place is a 5.   If we are talking about authentic, memorable Mexican food, this place is a 3.   Since my reviews are heavily based towards the food, the review is a 3."}
{"text":"The service and food were both amazing! This is by far my favorite place that I've tried in Pittsburgh! We tried the mushroom and chicken tacos as well as the queso."}
{"text":"So you've heard the talk and you've read the gushing. Tako is the bomb spot...blah, blah, blah. Well, I hate to tell y'all.   They ain't lying.  This place is one of the reasons Pittsburgh's food scene is making a name for itself all across the world. Originality executed perfectly. May we suggest that you start with the Street Corn and the Papa Bravas? Although, I think my wife hit on a great idea to order the Street Corn as a side to be served with her tacos. Their take on a Long Island (the Neville Island Tea) was unlike any other and worth it. My wife had a drink special, the Basil Watermelon Margarita, which should be promoted to regular menu status.  The tacos...my wife ordered the Duck Confit tacos and I ordered the Korean tacos. First, the duck...the duck was perfectly cooked and moist. Think about the best Peking duck you've ever had, pre-constructed for you, and laid out on a wooden slab.   The Korean tacos were pretty much this: take authentic Korean BBQ short ribs, add all your favorite Korean side dishes, and wrap it up on the pancake you'd get with an order of Mushu Pork, and you've got the Korean tacos at Tako. Your taste buds and your stomach will thank you.   On top of that, the staff were friendly and were always around. You didn't have to wait excessively long for someone to come back and check on you.   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Top notch, best taste in the city (maybe not the best as far as price vs taste, like you could get something not as good, but way way cheaper).  Did one of their 'for two' meal flights, and ended up ordering more afterwards.  Pastor and Korean were amazing.  Creative cocktails, well done guac & salsa."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Great service ! Super tasty food! Server was very knowledgeable with their menus  I really recommend their funnel cake as a desert! Good luck"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for tako. I had heard great things and I am a huge mexican food fan, so I was excited. We made our reservation for 6 15 so we arrived about 10 after 6. We walked in and were told come back closer to 615..  uh what? So we went to the bar. The inside is EXTREMELY loud. And pretty small so there wasn't really anywhere to wait. I ordered the spicy cucumber margarita which was amazing. Finally our table was ready. Our waitress seemed very nice except for the fact that I couldn't hear a word she was saying due to the pounding music and the yelling. We decided on the street corn to start and I ordered the mushroom tacos. My boyfriend got the chicken. The street coen was insanely good. The tacos...For 12$ an order, I was expecting wow. But I've had better, for example pgh taco truck. These tacos were pretty salty and had huge chunks of Brussels and mushrooms.. I just wasnt wowed. My guy said his were really salty also. I think I'll skip this place next time and go to an authentic mexican place for my tacos where I can hear myself think and have probably a better taco."}
{"text":"My friends and I casually walked into tako not knowing that reservations had to be made weeks before for a guaranteed table. Good thing the weather was nice and outdoor seating was available in 20 minutes when we got there. One word of advice, definitely go for outdoor seating if you can. The environment inside is just way too chaotic, dark and bar-like, that you can barely hold a decent conversation with the people you're with. I'm not too sure what vibe they are going for, but indoor seating is definitely not ideal.   As for the tacos, they are hands down one of the best I've tasted albeit a little pricey. If you're planning on ordering 7 or more sets, get the combos which will save you a bit of money if you're going for the more expensive tacos. I tried the chorizo, Korean, Baja and pork shoulder one. Each of them had just the right amount of filling and flavor. I'd recommend the Korean most, because it's a nice twist to your regular taco. If you're a fan of egg, go for the chorizo one.  Two tacos in a set might seem like a little, but I was stuffed after my first 2 out of 4. Will definitely come back when I get the chance too! (And hopefully get outdoor seating...)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat (and also the most difficult to make reservations).  If you want to go, plan plan plan!  Think, reserve two months in advance.During the warm days, there are outdoor bar stools to sit at, and there is a bar inside.  I have one word for you: tacos.  Lovely, flavorful, happy taco-land.  We typically order from their main menu for dinner, however, their list of specials always sound delicious.  And don't forget their margaritas and beer selection.  If you are taking a date, the music is loud, so be prepared for that.  You also sit close to the people next to you.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! Went for my BF's birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. Our server Chris was awesome and very knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. We started with the ceviche which was great. We ordered the Chorizo, Baja, Steak, and Carnitas tacos. All were awesome and so flavorful but my favorite is the Baja, since I'm a Cali girl I love my fish! It's also the one with the least amount of spice. They brought out a Tres Laches Cake with a candle since it was my BF's birthday and that was really good as well. Definitely going to become one of our staple restaurants when we're downtown. Also the drinks were strong and good, try the Thai Coconut drink if you want something really tasty and different!"}
{"text":"The food and ambiance were good but for the price it's a little much. Smoke in lawrencville has tacos twice the size for a better price! Little over hyped if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and margaritas. Their queso is also a 10/10! Be sure to make a reservation ahead of time though. If you have a party of two, you can typically snag a spot at the bar if you hang around for a bit."}
{"text":"The guacamole was amazing!!! My husband usually doesn't even eat quac loved it! We split tacos my favorite were the pollo and he enjoyed the pork shoulder and wagyu steak!"}
{"text":"The food are super super spicy and hot. I ordered takeout and they didn't warn me or say anything. Kale looks nothing like the photo. No avocado in it. Red pepper powder all over. Can't have any of it. Ended up wasting my dinner $."}
{"text":"Dined here with my husband last night and had a great experience. Started with the traditional guac and chips which were very good. I then had the Korean tacos, my husband the chorizo. Both were excellent. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that I didn't love the atmosphere. It was very dark and music fairly loud, made it hard to talk and almost HAD to have a light to read menu!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The food came out on time and was absolutely delicious. The rest of the customers seemed to be having a good time as well."}
{"text":"Place rocks.  Trendy and cool.  Tacos were very good.  Sat at bar outside and watched them being made in the kitchen.  I like places that do one thing and do it good, and this did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Amazing! Simply, Purely, Incredible food! The chips and dips packed such a fabulous array of flavors and the Pollo Asado and Bistec were the best tacos I ever had in my life. I wouldn't even consider them tacos because they are a step up from that. This restaurant is in a league of its own. I will never eat at another Mexican restaurant. Worth the trip but be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Food, drinks, atmosphere were all great! My only complaint was that our food took longer than expected to get to our table. We recommend the Papa Bravas to start and then move onto the tacos!   We sat at the bar and the bartenders were highly talented and did not bother us unless our drinks got empty. Also, most of the cocktails are tequila based which I don't care for, so I let the bartender know and he gladly made me a rum-based drink that ended up being amazing! I will definitely come back here to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I had to see what all the hype was over.. everytime I walked by this place it was PACKED! I tried to get a table once before and they didn't take reservations so it made me want to come here even more. The tuna poke was AMAZING! By far my favorite dish since Iv moved to Pittsburgh. The service was \"ok\" our waiter probably should of checked on us a little more but they were extremely busy. I thought fourteen dollars was a little pricey for two tacos but it was worth it compared to everything else Iv ate in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! I had the shrimp tacos on the house made corn tortillas (which are phenomenal and I wish I could buy!). The drink is the blood orange margarita, also delish. The set up is great with the outside bar, you feel like you aren't in Pittsburgh and the staff was all very friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here s couple weeks ago and it was awesome! The sign in front looked a bit shady but this place is really nice on the inside. Wait staff was good, you can put your name down and they'll next you when you table is ready. The mushroom tacos were amazing, probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The drinks we're decently strong and tasty."}
{"text":"Great vibe, unique menu, fabulous cocktails, and delicious food. Only downside is that it's not a huge place and it's so trendy these days that you have to set a reservation weeks in advance to get in. Definitely a must check out place though."}
{"text":"Just YUM!  Awesome food, nice people.  Very interesting spin on traditional tacos."}
{"text":"10:30 reservation through Yelp,  went after play & Pirate game with teen kids, great inside/ outside restaurant connected with Butcher & Rye. Great decor, lively bar seen.. got a booth upstairs. Kids had lots to see to keep them awake....Tried the cucumber & pineapple spicy cocktails that were great! Made to order guacamole & chips that was perfect, then shared the pollo asado & Bistec steak tacos... both were a hit, probably loved the Bistec more bc of the salsa/ cilantro insides. Service was friendly-We will be back without the kids next time! Thanks Tako!"}
{"text":"Great experience here. We started at the bar for a few drinks while we waited for a table. We were sat after 30 minutes at the outdoor bar. Started with the build your own Guacamole (we did #2) and fish sauce wings. While we were eating out appetizers, it got very dark and started to rain. They immediately moved us to an inside table and held our main courses. We split the chorizo and al pastor tacos. Both were delicious.   My only complaint is that the wings had way too much fish sauce. Other than that, we enjoyed every bit of the meal. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  First thing I noticed when I walked in was the six or so sidewalk bar seats outside facing the restaurant with the kitchen right in the front.  Looked like a great place to sit on a nice day.  Next was the kitchen itself, glassed in and with about 8 people crafting plates.  It was nice to see tortillas being freshly pressed.  The actual dinning room consists of a long line of two person high tables on the left a bar on the right and an upstairs area where some larger booths are located, which can accommodate a group of up to six.  The restaurant is decorated in a Gothic meets modern industrial meets Latin style which was well executed.  Unfortunately it was only about 55 degrees outside and they were running the AC which made the downstairs tables quite chilly.  Drinks: Tried the spicy cucumber marg as well as the anjeo and absinthe one.  Both were well done.  They had a selection of primarily Mexican and Asian beers starting around 4 bucks.  Interesting cocktail list as well and would definitely like to try their sangria at some point.  Food: We started with the Chef's Choice #5 guac which had crab, cojita cheese, and peppers.  It was Amazing!...could seriously eat that every day.  Next we split three orders of tacos, which come with two per order.  I was expecting Mexican style street tacos which can be quite small.  I was wrong.  They were big.  We got the Tako (octupus), Al Pastor, and Korean (short rib).  All were good, but the Al Pastor was the stand out for me.  The pork was cooked perfect as was wonderfully seasoned.  The Korean and Octopus and a little too much sauce for my likely, as it overpowered some of the other flavors.  Service: Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, though the service was on the slow side.  Tips: Make a reservation a few days in advanced if possible.  I called for a same day reservation for two on a Tuesday and they were booked solid.  Nice spot for a casual yet trendy date.  $20 corkage fee if you'd like to bring your own bottle of wine.  Overall: I will be back at some point to give them another try.  The food was solid and drinks were well made.  Lost a star for service and for temperature control.  I should have brought a coat."}
{"text":"Awesome food.... the tuna poke and octopus tacis were fantastic!   Great service too!"}
{"text":"Guacamole was not up to snuff this time.  Virtually no tuna belly and the flavors were very off."}
{"text":"I love me some tacos. These are tasty but certainly overpriced. Las Palmas are slightly better at half the cost.  The drinks here are absolutely spectacular. Tasty, strong, multiple interesting ingredients. Would return for drinks exclusively."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 favorite places in Pittsburgh.  Insanely good.  Get the mushroom.  All of the others tacos are my second favorite.  And the whipped cheesecake, oh my gosh,  a dessert this fatty shouldn't have, but it's so good it should be mandatory."}
{"text":"My update... My husband and I decided to give Täko another try. Bad idea! I explained to the waiter that I can't handle spice/heat well at all and asked what suggestions he could offer. He explained to me that all of the dishes were well balanced. Yes but... So he said that the mushroom tacos weren't spicy at all. WRONG! I can't comprehend why he couldn't tell me which ingredient was the spice/heat and remove it upon placing my order. I felt he had a script and couldn't deviate from it to honestly answer my questions. The guacamole was tasty and the drinks are fantastic!  The vibe is great and, again, the cocktails are delicious! I can't get over the incredibly spicy tacos."}
{"text":"I think in the case of Tako, a \"Just the facts\" type of review is best.  My s/o and I reserved a table, one month in advance.  Unfortunately, Tako has limited indoor seating.  Upon arrival we noticed that we could have sat at their outdoor counter and eaten,  (Something that we were never made aware).   In retrospect, eating outside would have been so much better because inside was extraordinarily LOUD!!!  Tako has two levels of seating, downstairs is elevated and small tables and the side which is on the aisle is just a stool, no back.  Upstairs it looked like metal tables and equally uncomfortable chairs.  It was a Friday night, so there were lots of people at the bar, which make the noise level even louder.  The strange thing was that they had a DJ playing really, really loud music over some massive speakers which were hanging from the ceiling.  It's dark and loud inside.  I wasn't told that I would be dining at an AC/DC concert.  Waiter took forever to even get to our table, like 10 mins and took our drink order.  A mixed drink is $10, and they have an extensive tequila list but with little explanation as to what is what.  Mix'n match guacamole was just ho-hum and the stuff you can ad is somewhat intriguing but all in all, flavorless.  Drinks were just okay, not very strong or flavorful for the money.  Taco's were good but not great.  The carnitas  was the better of the two we ordered, (the other was beef)  Honestly, for what the ingredients were, there was just a total lack of flavor.  They are good size and you get two tacos per order.  No matter how you dress them up, they're still just tacos and not worth the month long wait.  I'm not a 20 year old but I'm not 50 either and I'm really tired of these new restaurants that are blaring must so loud that I can't hear what the person across from me is saying.  Mediocre food, ho-hum margaritas, lazy waitstaff and ear splitting music is what you can expect if you decide to spend some time at Tako.  Oh, and did I forget they have just one bathroom!  Gross."}
{"text":"One word: overrated Maybe we got the wrong stuff but....The Baja taco sucks. Dry, no flavor, and obviously we made a huge mistake getting it. The chicken taco was much better and had flavor as well as the queso fundido. However be aware,you would think a place that charges you $10 for a cheese dip would give you at least two orders of tortilla rolls,but they don't, they give you enough for half, then they secretly charge you a $1 when you ask for more.....it's the principle.  We were so disappointed by the exceptional hype the city of Pittsburgh has poured in this place that the mood was set after the flavorless Baja taco.  The el Diablo did not taste like anything special either except that it was a normal margarita that costs $10. I would have rather dumped $70 on mad mex which has more reliable food am that is worth the money.......Or wish that Yo!Rita was still open......or Verde........or I lived closer to Taco Bell. Our waiter was great though..... Extremely disappointed by the hype and how overpriced it is. Also for how annoying it is to make a reservation and how long people wait, the place was 2/3rds full the entire time."}
{"text":"Service, hostess and even the busboy were polite and exemplary!  Food and cocktails were amazing.  Highly recommend sharing with your significant other or family.  I would love to get reservations with a big group, that would be spectacular to share and pass around the specials and menu staples.  Would come here again a million times over!   Best Margarita EVER btw, the atmosphere was fun yet not pretentious, a DJ......only thing missing is a beach or ocean view!  And it connects to Butcher and the Rye, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a reservation over a month ago for this past Friday. Anytime we tried going before, we were told there was nothing available until 10:45pm. After dining there, I was confused. We were there for an hour and a half and were 3 of like 8 tables. Also, the entire time we were there, 3 tables were open upstairs. Weird since they are always \"booked\". Service was okay. Not very attentive and not much of a personality. Tacos are one of my favorites. The tacos were good. Nothing over the top though. A lot of other places are just as good. I am glad I tried it though. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"It was nice sitting right outside on a street, warm summer night, strangers passing by... some what romantic... We ordered a huge board with tacos! Was so good! Every taco was different, just the combination of flavors was so incredible! And lavender cocktail was just perfect!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were amazing. The classic margarita was really good as well.  However, the lighting wasn't so good inside. Also, my chicken asado taco was a little under done and not all ingredients were listed. I shouldn't have to ask for every ingredient when ordering.  Since I can't eat nuts and seeds and they weren't listed but on the food I was not able to eat and could see because the lights were so low."}
{"text":"Love their lunch menu and hope that they would consider keeping the lunch hours even after summer. The poke bowl is my favorite! Their tacos are also never bland and the flavoring of the meat alway pairs well with the other ingredients. They have a great balance."}
{"text":"Words. Great Food. We sat at grill and watched food made from the street. It's a stationary food truck. Great great great"}
{"text":"Take out orders are only accepted in person.  I called to place an order, received a very annoyed employee on the phone,  and was told (reluctantly) that they do take out orders, but you have to place the order in person.   I don't understand the policy.  The employee was rude. (Main reason for the low rating)  I probably won't eat there in the future. Luckily,  I ordered from another local restaurant. Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious from start to finish.   We ordered the guacamole (just the basic one)  which was friggin amazing, the street corn (again, amazing), chips and salsa, Pollo, bisteca, and carnitas tacos, the cheese cake, coconut tapioca, and finally the funnel cakes.   Funnel cakes were good but nothing to write home about and the hot chocolate they come with was good but rich, could have skipped that.   Everything else was phenomenonal and worth telling everyone about,  definitely my favorite restaurant under the umbrella of meat and potatoes, butcher and rye, etc.   Oh, drinks were delicious too, I highly recommend the spicy passion fruit margarita (I think that's what it was called) or the basil watermelon margarita.  Kudos to a killer addition to the new hot Pittsburgh restaurants.  Ps... Staff was wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Very trendy place, dark, noisy, full of hipsters. But the food was amazing. The special guacamole (crab) was very tasty and interesting. The poke was out of this world, with tuna that melted in your mouth and just the right mix of spicy, sweet, and umami. Had the Korean taco and special crispy shrimp taco. Flavors were authentic and very well balanced. Wanted to lick the plate! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. My fiancé took me here for our first time to celebrate my birthday. This place exceeded all expectations by far. One thing to note, you do need to make reservations a bit in advance so plan accordingly. With our reservation, we had no issues getting seating on time.  I order the spicy cucumber margarita and hands down was one of the best margaritas I've had. It's made with fresh ingredients and you can taste the tequila which I loved.  For an appetizer, we ordered the queso and wings. The wings are super crispy and covered in a sweet and spicy sauce. They even give you hot hand towels to wipe the sauce off. The queso was good but would have been a bit easier to eat with chips. The tortillas that come with make it a bit hard to eat but it's good.  I had the carnitas tacos for my meal and I will say they are quite large tacos. I couldn't even finish my second one. I would definitely go back to try the others.  Our waitress was amazing! She explained everything and was always around to fill up our drinks. It's hard to find service like that at other places.   The atmosphere is a bit different as well but it goes with the place. The only thing to note is there is one bathroom for the whole restaurant that is unisex. Just be prepared for that."}
{"text":"I LOVE the appetizers, especially the Pappas, amazing!  The original Tako is my favorite but truly cannot for wrong with any of the food or cocktails, they are all amazing."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the food is excellent! The only downside is how difficult it is to get a reservation here! Definitely worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Veg Standpoint - first of all you have to reserve this place many days or weeks in advance to get at the right time. Luckily we went in and got some seats at the bar. The food was excellent even from a veg standpoint.  We had the street corn as a starter and it was excellent. The mushroom taco was nice had a meet texture but was not amazing. They have some special Riesling and egg white drink which was awesome."}
{"text":"Tako was one of the best dining experiences Ive had since I moved up here close to three years ago. The food was top notch, prepared exceptionally with tremendous attention to detail. Everything my girlfriend and I ordered was delicious. We highly recommend the Baja Fish Tacos, Korean Tacos and Street Corn.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was HORRIBLE. Justen was our server. We never got our drinks and he never once checked on us. He took our order and he never came back until I flagged him down for our check. I was very disappointed because I brought an out of town guest, who has never been to Pittsburgh or Pennsylvania, to Tako due to all the wonderful things I've heard. The food was good but quite honestly, the waiter ruined our experience. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the big board of tacos (tako, bistec, Korean, chorizo, Al pastor, & duck confit)  tuna belly guacamole,  and spicy passion fruit Margarita... everything was DELICIOUS and the service was great!!! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best taco's I have had.    Cool atmosphere, nice staff, and killer food.    Over ordered and could not stop trying and tasting the fantastic creations.    Thank you Tako!"}
{"text":"We went late but there service was still good. The tacos were tasty but lacked that something that would really wow me."}
{"text":"the first and hopefully not the last time I will eat a taco with octopus in it. Usually I can't handle food in which you can see the original anatomy of where it came from (ex. tentacles with visible suction cup things) but I ate a taco with said visible anatomy and I will be doing it again in the future. Kind of pricey, VERY hip (consider wearing your clubbing outfit for this one), but tons of fun."}
{"text":"tako was not worth the hype. Service was not good, food was average and it was so loud that I couldn't even hear my husband."}
{"text":"Really fresh and amazing tacos here! It's more of an upscale and trendy vibe rather than a hole-in-the-wall taco joint (which I prefer) but the tacos are hands down the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ate and drank so much. Spent a lot of money but felt worth it. I don't eat meat and was pleased that there was more than enough on the menu for me to order. We probably ordered too much but there was so much to try. Our waiter was really nice and attentive and didn't rush us at all even though it was getting late (we could only get a reservation on a Sunday night at 8pm and we were late because of a Penguins game). I think the negatives are that it's really dark, like hard to read the menu so dark and very loud, so a little hard to talk. But I would go back in a heart beat if we can get a reservation."}
{"text":"It's tough to say whether tako deserves 4 or 5 stars since they do nearly everything here very well.  The drinks are interesting, the ambiance is fun, the service is great, and the food is all prepared excellently however the only drawback in my opinion is that the tacos here all try to be a bit too exotic and miss the mark a little bit flavor-wise.  I've eaten here several times now and all of the appetizers I've had, including the build your own guacamole, have been absolutely delicious.  It's worth coming here just for the queso appetizer alone.  It's also amazing to get a hot, moist towel to clean your hands with after the wing appetizer, every restaurant needs to do this.  As mentioned above, the tacos are all cooked well, but after having sampled nearly every variety on the menu none of the flavor combinations quite 'click' for me even when I think they should based on the menu description.  The tacos are all tasty and I'll keep coming back for more, but I haven't had the 'that taco was amazing' moment yet."}
{"text":"the best tacos i have ever had.  very unique tacos done perfectly.  great service as well."}
{"text":"Tako is overrated.  I really wanted to love Tako because its former executive chef, Dave Racicot, is one of the most talented chefs I have ever had the pleasure of knowing (I have been eating at his restaurants since he opened Notion in Oakmont), so I expected great things. However, the amount of \"hype\" that surrounds Tako does not reflect the actual food. Yes, the food is good, but it is not worth making a reservation more than two days in advance for, and the prices are not worth the flavor; a $2.50 taco from Las Palmas in Oakland is both tastier and cheaper.  So, I'm not saying it's not worth going, but you should not have as high expectations as the reviews would lead you to have."}
{"text":"Service was great. The Philly tako was awesome. I thought portion size was great and good value.  My friend had the tako-tako which indicated was delicious. You can see into the kitchen and it was clean and busy. The ambiance was also fun And unique. Little to dark inside for me to see menu, but I'm sure that's not the case for everyone"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is my favorite spot in the city. The atmosphere is super cool, the food is phenomenal, the waiters are the best around and the playlist is the bomb. We took our elementary aged children for dinner before a Pirates game but I'm looking forward to another couples night out here."}
{"text":"The food is really really good!! Its fresh and made well. The combination of the ingredients complimented each other. The chips and salsa were a good choice. The chips are delicious and tasted good! They were  not too salty, just a nice crispy fresh chip. We ordered the Carnnitas and Korean tacos. My mom got the classic margarita for $10, it was a short glass with mostly ice.The drink tasted good, but in two sips it was gone. I'd definitely go back:)"}
{"text":"Had really high expectations of this place but that was mistaken. I ordered the Korean taco and the meat was sweet and I disliked it. We ordered the crab guacamole n it was just an overpriced nonsense."}
{"text":"Seated us with our reservation right away. Yelp app convenient method to make reservation - including quick link to their menu and address/map.  Service excellent - Damien was informative, personable, attentive and appropriate - all we want in a server!   Food prep, ingredients & presentation are unique, fresh - and delicious.  Same with drinks ...  Take taco was unique ... had the lamb special tacos - interesting land & sea combo for my wife & I.   Store-made fresh custom guacamole terrific - neat way to let diner make own guacamole concoction!!    everything met and exceeded the high expectations we had . Top reputation well-deserved."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Thursday night, no reservation, got a table for two with no problem. It appears to be a street taco stand, but it's actually a hipsterish bar with an over the top unnecessary DJ. We were not thrilled with the drinks.. We returned both the Neville island tea and the blood orange frozen concoction. Way too strong, as it should be for $10, but we weren't trying to get drunk without appeasing our taste buds at the same time. The food was pricey... You can get the same quality at a Mexican taco stand for $2.00... And it's much more authentic. You'll like this place if you like throwing away money for an interesting twist on classic Mexican cuisine. $16 for two shrimp tacos, or $75 for a board of 12. They are definitely making a killing here, but not from my wallet, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Carnitas are the best I've ever had. Chips and guacamole are good but should not be $15. Would give five stars if they price wasn't so high but it still doesn't stop me from hearing there everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Very loud and energizing environment with live DJ. Grapefruit Margaritas, crab nachos, and tuna poke were outstanding! If looking for a fun night of food and music get a late night table on the weekend!"}
{"text":"tried this place 4 times...just not living up to the hype...not worth the price..when there are better places with nicer staff. Was told our table for 4, could not add a chair for our friend that stopped in...no one seemed to care that we were willing to change places or even wait again...super disappointed..over and over. But allot of people seem to dig drinking that kool-aid...just not me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time tonight (Thursday, 9:30pm) and was shocked to find the place still packed. Fortunately we were able to get a table, and soon were delighted to find out that today marked the start of a new menu. Seeing the word 'butternut', I immediately opted for the appetizer, and picked the salmon tacos as my second must-try. The grapefruit sage margarita? Necessary as well.  Grapefruit sage margarita: pleasantly surprised by the fresh grapefruit flavor and the alcohol content  Butternut tostada: the highlight of this app was the spiced honey which really was only on the plate below the tostada. The butternut squash flavor was good, but there was too much ricotta. This would have been significantly better as a warm dish with the honey drizzled on top.  Salmon tacos: perfect. Each of the two tacos had a fillet of salmon all to itself. Perfectly cooked, melt-in-yo-mouth salmon combined with guac and pickled red onion makes for a happy me.  Choco tacos: better (and also less chocolatey) than I expected. Waffle cone taco, lined with chocolate on the inside, chocolate around the rim. Filled with avocado lime ice cream (you really only taste the lime). Topped with strawberry pieces/syrup and coconut crumble cookies. Yes there's a lot going on, but yes, it's interesting and really great to split between two people (two tacos).  I will say you should be prepared for not much attention from the server as this spot is very busy. However, the food did arrive quickly.   I really enjoyed the experience and the addition this place makes to downtown. Great place to try if you are in the mood for drinks and tacos (aka always) and are in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had. The sensation of the taco with my mouth was out of this world."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever had, one of the best guacamole, amazing nachos, and an amazing mezcal cocktail. Probably my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant!"}
{"text":"Again these guys are killin it! Great food at great prices! When the staff is having fun the result is excellent food and a great environment!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Tako's was overdone and filled with hipster douches.  There was an abundance of octopus theme shit everywhere.  Like I'm pretty sure the owners have an obsession with hentai porn.  There is a mural depicting such a fetish as an octopus grasps a topless woman..please cover her nipples, they offend me.  We had the taco board that cost us $75.00 ..two tacos per person that were incredibly filling.  The following day I shit my brains out and prior to that had some of the worst gas in my life.  Like I'm sure this gas could have been used to euthanize Jews in auschwitz. All in all I give it 4 out of 5 stars because despite destroying my anus those tacos were worth it."}
{"text":"So delicious and so happy to have gotten a reservation. Had the corn, potatoes, #1 guacamole, chips and salsa as well as the Tako, al pastor, bistec and pollo tacos.  Cocktails were so good. Nothing disappointed and the DJ has a great mix of music! My friends and I are still talking about our dinner last night this morning! Thanks Tako!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to do my best to describe the meal we just had at Tako, but I certainly won't do it justice. Suffice it to say, it was one of the most perfect experiences dining out that we've had in a long, long time.  We knew coming in to not over order tacos like we did the last time, which put us in good shape. To start we had the classic guacamole and the Poke appetizer. The guacamole was as good as the last time with some homemade, still warm, tortilla chips.  The Poke? One of the best appetizers we've ever had. It was served with a spicy soy dressing, whipped lime and guacamole (which we weren't expecting). You eat it over some rice crackers and it melted in your mouth.  For our tacos, we decided on the bistec and the special Korean fried chicken which were both incredible. The couple next to us overordered like we did on or first visit, you could see it in their face immediately.  We were drinking beer and a cucumber margarita that had my wife salivating... After dinner we had a pour it Reposado to go with our sangrita. They didn't have sangrita last time we were here, so I'm glad they added it to the menu (as their manager promised).  Which led us to dessert. Fresh cheesecake served in a bowl with vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, and a lime (strawberry?) sauce. I'm not even that big on cheesecake, but once again, perfection. It didn't have any \"crust\" or \"crunch\" element but the fresh berries and mint were fantastic.  It was a special occasion, but the bill was only $100, which for what we got was incredibly reasonable. I booked the reservations 3 weeks in advance, so plan ahead of you want an early enough reservation. They definitely cater to couples of two, as opposed to parties."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. We did not have a reservation but they accommodated us anyways. They did forget one of our orders but by then we were too full to notice."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Pittsburgh and I yelped for top star rated restaurants in my area. It led me to Tako.   Walking up the store front, it looked very busy. All the tables outside and the bar top seating in front of the cooking area were full. The kitchen is right up in front with seating for about 6. If you decide to sit outside in front of the kitchen, you can enjoy your meal while watching the chefs assemble and prepare everyone's food. We initially thought those were the only seating available bc the door to the actual restaurant on the side of the kitchen didn't look very inviting. I thought it was an employee only door.   We finally walked in after attempting to glance inside for a few minutes and found ourselves in a very dimly lit room with a bar that lined the whole right side of the restaurant, high top tables on all the left and a stairway in the back that led you upstairs to more tables. There were two large red chandeliers that hung from the ceiling and lighting featuring octopus tentacles all along the wall.   At 7pm on a Wednesday night they were all booked up for inside seating until 10pm. The host took down our phone number and told us outside seating will be available in an hour and 15 minutes. We decided to wait since the restaurant was so highly rated and there was a car show outside that night that could keep us entertained.   An hour later, we were back after a text from the restaurant and we were actually seated inside. Since it was so dark inside, I actually had a hard time helping myself into my high top seating. I swear I was going to step on the wrong thing and fall.   After struggling into my seat, the waiter greeted us quickly and handed us two newspapers and 2 sheets of papers. Their menu is actually printed on the newspaper and one sheet of paper had the choices for your personalized guac and the other had their specialty cocktails and food specials. We ordered the #5 off the guac menu which was a crab meat guacamole with mango and we added pepitos to give it a nice kick. The guac came quickly with freshly fried chips. The chips were not greasy at all and the crab meat blending very well with the taste of the avocados.  The taste of the mangos were very light, it just gave the guac a nice hint of sweetness. Only thing was, they can be a bit heavy handed with the salt.   We also order grilled tuna tacos, Korean short rib tacos and chicken asada tacos. 2 to an order and we liked the tuna and Korean short rib the best. The tuna was perfectly seared with spicy mayo drizzled on top. And the short rib tacos was made a thick sauce on a bed of lightly pickled veggies. I do have to say, those were a bit salty also. The chicken tacos were good too but the other two just had the perfect combo for your taste buds.   We were too full to get dessert but fiance got a mule and I had a sip. Was a bit sweeter than most mules but you can taste the fresh lime juice with the ginger beer. I liked the sweetness so it was good to me.   One guac, 6 tacos and a mule came out to $86 which is a bit expensive for tacos but I guess you're also paying for the ambience and decor.   Oh and the music choice was quite interesting too. Drake and the Weeknd... don't get me wrong, I loved the music. Just not the music I thought they would play for such a hipster-ish type establishment.   And sorry it was too dark to get pictures of the food. Didn't want to be that one person to make the whole place light up bc of the flash on my phone."}
{"text":"One of the many wonderful things that Pittsburgh has built up, is its food scene. Around the time that I was moving to Pittsburgh, was also a time when folks were starting to spend more evenings venturing in-between the buildings that make up the Pittsburgh skyline. What they found was a strong sense of creativity and collaboration among the many dining options available. And, at the same time that downtown became a dwelling spot for diners and drinkers, a new restaurant opened up that caught people's attention and captured their imagination with all the things that Pittsburgh was and will be. Tako, located on Penn Avenue in the Cultural District, is a testament of the simplicity and innovation that makes up Pittsburgh. Simply enough, Tako serves tacos...but, it does so much more than that. What Tako is, is a combination of ideas, flavors, and ambiance that leaves you satisfied with the simplicity of it all. When you walk into Tako, you will notice that the space is dark and fairly small, creating an intimate vibe. At the same time, you realize that there is a live D.J. playing upbeat tunes in the corner, which makes you feel like you are at food and music venue in Austin or a bar in LA's Beverly Grove. When you sit down you will be given a newspaper style menu where you will find a plethora of headline specialty tacos. The flavors here come across as \"old-world ingredients meet citrus and chili combinations\". It's nothing that you haven't heard of before but every new blend that you want to try. The tacos will come out on wooden boards in pairs of 2. They are huge and loaded with goodness. The first time I ate at Tako, I made the mistake of getting way too excited over the \"build your own guacamole\" appetizer. It is definitely something to get excited about but, keep in mind that there will be more to come! If you do find yourself with leftovers, don't worry - the servers have this great way of boxing your tacos up so that when you go to eat them the next day for lunch (or breakfast), your tacos are still intact. Being vegetarian, I was extremely happy with the mushroom tacos. Packed with flavor and texture, they were so hearty for being mushrooms. And the sauce on top... the perfect match between creamy and spicy.  When you eat at Tako you will be transported into a whole new world and your taste buds will never be the same. You may even forget that you are in downtown Pittsburgh, becoming engulfed in the environment around you. As you leave the restaurant, however, and step out onto Penn avenue with a full stomach,  it may occur to you how simple of a concept taco's are and how Tako took a modest concept and made it something brilliant. This is a great example of the revival of Pittsburgh: simple, yet bursting with flavor; true to its roots, yet never failing to seek out creativity.   Enjoy!  Xoxo, A  (a California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)"}
{"text":"This is A-Ok as far as Taco's go with a hip atmosphere. It's centrally located downtown and a short walk from PNC Park, so I can see this being a good place to come to after a game. The tacos are big, making two a full meal for most people. I had the carnitas and Korean BBQ tacos and they were ok, nothing amazing. They were both a bit too meaty. I would have preferred it to have more garnish for added flavor."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos....YUMMMMM!!!! I don't get to Pittsburgh much but the next time I do.......:) LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars because the service was so great and the atmosphere was unique and cool BUTTT unfortunately the tacos were salty (for my palate).  I got the \"el pastor\" and it sounded and looked so delicious (on menu and on the plate)...but again, it was a tad too salty for me. My friends agreed.  But I know another group of my friends thought the food was perfectly seasoned... so maybe I went on an off night?  I'm definitely willing to give this place  another chance though!"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! This place is kinda hard to get a reservation with short notice so plan in advance if its a party of more then 2. We didn't get reservations but were clever enough to go to the restaurant right as they opened and were lucky to get seated and served right away. The atmosphere is very trendy with upbeat music, dimmed red lights and chandeliers. The service was great since they were able to seat us without a reservation and the waiter was helpful and friendly. Now for the good stuff, FOOD was the best! Start out with their guacamole, its not your typical avocoda/lime/cilantro their speciality guacamole has meat and cheeses that add much more to the texture and taste. We ordered the guacamole that had duck meat and blue cheese, probably one of the best guacamole Ive ever had. Since duck is uncommon meat option also ordered duck tacos, they give you two tacos with enough meat and toppings to make them filling. I love the unusual combination of ingredients, everything I ordered exceeded excellence!"}
{"text":"Top of the pops when it comes to tacos in town!  Hi Lovers!  I went on a dinner date to this place finally! I have to say I was impressed all around. Great inventive margaritas. I had a cucumber drink that was so refreshing for summer. Chips and guacamole were fresh and fabulous. We decided on splitting chicken tacos and a salmon special. The salmon special ended up being fabulous. A cream and pistachio sauce topped delicious roasted salmon. Homemade tortillas made this a great dish. The space is very small. You think it is deeper and larger than it really is and I get why it can be hard to get a table. I do like that the kitchen is completely visible and you can watch them cook at the front of the restaurant. The bar is great to try to grabs a seat and actually eat and not wait! It's dark and hip and perfect for a date! ;)  I will be back and you should visit too!"}
{"text":"Tako is SO good! The environment was fun. It's a pricey restaurant but the seafood tacos and delicious margs definitely make up for it. Top notch date spot. My girlfriend and I went here after seeing a show across the street. Definitely a must if you love tacos and seafood!"}
{"text":"The täkos are really, really good. Too much relish on the tempura fish was overpowering. The cocktails are well thought out and perfectly executed. But...   WHAT MANNER OF NARCOTIC IS IN THESE FUCKING CHIPS, YOU ANIMALS? I CAN'T STOP. OMG, SEND HELP. 911.  Seriously, they did the math on this maillard reaction. I'm picturing some duder in the back with a pomodoro timer and a masters in biochem. These little life ruiners are perfectly over-salted. Order a sweet and tangy cocktail and revel in first world culinary bliss."}
{"text":"Maravilloso!!! Finally to experience Tako and wow.   Tako is so trendy.. dim lighting and funky décor offers a fun experience for a patron at any age.  I made reservations through yelp (of course) and received a confirmation through email the day of.   Me and my party arrived a little early and had a seat the bar where we received excellent service.   The dining area on the first floor is half booth and tables..  pretty close to each other - not so ideal for a private dining experience.  I was pleased to be seated upstairs where they are cool booths!!  It was perfect for a party of four (4).  Our waiter didn't miss a beat by saying hello right away and answered many of our questions (and took pictures too).   We started off with the guacamole.   The chips that accompanied the dip were thick and crisp.. so tasty.   Many have told me that Tako had the best guac and it was good but not the best I have ever had.  My taste buds searched for other flavors that weren't present..such as \"tomato\" or more of a an onion flavor.  It was obviously fresh but not as flavorful as expected.  My taste buds weren't singing.   I ordered the \"Bistec\" which was tacos with steak, shishito peppers, cilantro, red romaine and was DELICIOUS!!! I could have lived on this variation my whole life. Everything was fresh.. and plenty of cilantro.. love it!  Two tacos were $15.00 - but it's worth it. To accompany my tacos ... I wanted to try the \"Street Corn\" side which was only $6.00.   It sounded so interesting. I expected loose corn but instead three small pieces of corn on the cob arrived.. smothered with Siracha Mayo, chil, cheese and lime.    It was different and very flavorful. There were more toppings on the corn than actual corn.  It was difficult to eat - but delicious at the same time.    Don't let some of the prices fool you.. there are plenty of \"starters\" available if you are on a budget and its worth the experience.   I parked at the parking garage on the corner of sixth and fort duq and it was only $7.00    Dining at Tako was a great experience and I cannot wait to go back!!!!!!! !"}
{"text":"This place is a total gem: great service, hip atmosphere and the food that will blow you away! The highlights:   tacos: octopus, Korean, mushroom; also poke, corn, ceviche - all delicious. Guac was good, but we have had better - lacked salt and life juice, but the fact that you can \"build your own\" is pretty cool and a fresh take on menu and ordering.  Grapefruit margaritas were perfect! When back in Pittsburgh - will def eat here again!"}
{"text":"You should eat here. The food is absolutely amazing. (And relatively inexpensive - we each paid around $25 and had a delicious fresh cocktail, two tacos and split chips/salsa). We were so lucky to grab a table on the sidewalk without a reservation and the staff was incredibly friendly. This was a fantastic choice for a post-work happy hour dinner/drink. I'm excited to go back and try the wall of tequila."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times and everything is always delicious! Best queso ever!"}
{"text":"Everything was tremendous,  from the chips and salsa to the frozen drinks that were on special.  Although it did take nearly 2 months to get into the place due to the hours of operation and them being booked on reservations,  the food was well worth the wait.  I had the wagu  beef tacos and it was amazing.  Would recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"For what this place is, it's great. I'm not terribly into pricey cocktails or expensive renditions of  something I love, so I'm pretty biased. Our server here was good, but he called me something like sweetie or babe when I first got there and it was annoying. Bad joke. My tacos were tasty, though the portions were small. I also had a really good mixed drink, something with cucumber or mint? It was summer at the time, so it made sense! Pretty meh about this place and wouldn't make another special trip back."}
{"text":"Just recently discovered Täk? is now open for lunch which is great. While I am limited in what I can eat due to celiac I tried to poke bowl here and it was delicious. You can build your own which is great for me. The tuna is really good + fresh. It may seem a little pricey for lunch at $14 but very good and worth the price. Took about 10-15 minutes from when I ordered till when my food was ready for takeout. Another great lunch option downtown!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try out this restaurant after hearing so much about it.  I arrived to my party once they were seated and they ordered a few different types of salsas and guacamole and an order of the queso.  I could have just settled on these chips for the entire meal, but I knew I had to have a try at a taco.  I went for the shrimp.  At first I thought it was on the pricier side, but when I saw each taco had 8 pieces of shrimp  it made the price feel a bit more reasonable.  For a drink I had their classic margarita which tasted very fresh and well mixed.   The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because there was a drip of water coming down from the roof onto me a handful of times for the length of our stay."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night with the boyfriend. Had a reservation and was sat right away. Atmosphere is awesome and our server Damian was fantastic! He was super knowledgeable and took his time to answer questions and make his recommendations adding his own personality into his spiel which was cool. He never lead us astray. The food was phenomenal. Very happy with our decision to go there!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. We were in town visiting from California and noticed the outside bar seating area which looked super cool, and the place was a block from our hotel. We ate there before going to a Pirates game. The food at takos was TO DIE FOR no wonder the foodnetwork was there filming while we were eating"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. If you are in Pittsburgh you have to visit. I had the kale salad which was the perfect amount of crunch. They dressed it in a soy dressing that was perfect, was a little spicy though so if you are not into spice may want to hold the peppers. Followed by the kale salad was the street corn of which I could have honestly ate 3 orders to myself. Probably my favourite thing I had all night. Then I had the Korean tacos which were good but a little dry, still very tasty but could use more sauce."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos and guac, a little pricey like all other restaurants in the \"hip\" dahntahn area."}
{"text":"I don't remember if this was reservation only or not, but I'd highly recommend them. We waited 45 minutes for a table, but wandered around downtown in the meantime until we got the text that our table was ready.   The food was delish, though slightly pricey. For about $12, you get two tacos of various toppings. We all decided that if there were 3 tacos to a portion, this place would be perfect. While delish, $6 for a taco is definitely pricey.   We tried the baja fish tacos, octopus, and the duck. The duck tacos were the unanimous favorite with their tangy sauce, but all were fantastic. Get the duck tacos if it's your first time, they were out of this world.   If I get the chance, I'll definitely come here for some late night eats, but with a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious food, probably my favorite taco in Pittsburgh. Cool atmosphere. Perfect for a date night or girls night out. Make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"I mean, what is there to say about tako that hasn't already been said? I don't know if I knew what a taco was until I ate at tako. I suppose that is a good start? Tako is one of the several restaurants in the area that are owned by the same person/company. Pork & Beans and Meat & Potatoes (I think) are also related to tako in some strange bastardized brother-sister relationship. During my trip to Pittsburgh I was able to eat at two of the three restaurants and both were impressive. But alas, this review is about tako, and the cultural awakening it provided.  Food: Wow! Seriously. As a foodie, even I sometimes look at some foods, such as tacos, and say, \"a taco is a taco\", right? Well, I (and everyone else who may have uttered this phrase) would be wrong. We ordered the 'Korean Taco' and the 'Carnitas'. You wouldn't think that by ordering a carnitas taco they could bring much of anything new to the table. Well they did.  Carnitas: The pork was just unbelievable. Seasoned to perfection, moist, succulent, and tender. Seriously, I would eat a bowl of that pork! Then came all of the toppings and additives from guacamole, to chicharones, and other delectable and delicate nuances that turned this taco into a 'holy-sh*t-what-did-i-just-put-in-my-mouth!' From the warm corn tortilla that is cooked on a griddle, to all the toppings and combinations of flavors, this is seriously one of the most complete dishes I have ever eaten. Completely satisfies the palette. (5/5)  Korean: So, I said all of those outstanding things about the carnitas taco, so you'd think, 'what could he possibly say about this next one that could even compare?' Well, again, 'Wow!' Add everything I said about the carnitas taco, and sprinkle-in some umami. From the kimchi-slaw to the korean short rib meat, this taco took me to a place I didn't think was possible. I can't recommend this taco enough. (6/5...yea, that is a 6)  Tres Leches Cake: I am a fan of milk. Milk three times? Damn son...now that even has Fergie begging for more. Though, despite how good this dessert was, compared to the tacos, it was barely above average. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was good...damn good, but compared to those tacos, it was pretty typical of what I would expect. If anything, those tacos set that triple milk cake up for failure. Yea, I would hold a grudge if I were tres leches. (4/5)  Overall Food: 5 / 5  Service: This was very spotty. He was relatively attentive at first, but then required me to get his attention for every other facet of the meal. More water? Needed to ask for him. Dessert? Needed to ask for him. Check? Needed to ask for him. This was disappointing.  Service: 2 / 5  Atmosphere: This place is not my jam. It was loud, it was dark, it was hispter-ish, and it was tight/crowded. Pretty much everything I hate. Despite that, the furnishings were cool, and everything did flow extremely well together. This was a cool spot, it just wasn't for me. Despite that though, I would definitely eat at their outside seating or at the outside counter. Bonus points for that because it was super cool.  Atmosphere: 4 / 5  Price: Not much to say here. For the best tacos I have ever had, this is a sure 5. I don't even think I looked at the bill, that is how little I cared what the price was...and I am a thrifty kind of guy...coupon-cutter and everything!  Price: 5 / 5   Conclusion: Again, I probably didn't bring any new material to the table here; but if you haven't been to tako, this is a must-stop for you if you are visiting and near the 6th street location. Best tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"An absolute must if you like superb & unique tacos, an extensive Mexican beer selection and profoundly delicious margaritas! Add to that awesome bartenders to great chefs and a cool steel/octopus motif for the decor and you've got a great night. I highly recommend sitting at the bar - it's lively and you're definitely in the mix!  I had the duck tacos, a watermelon margarita, and because I buck norms the guacamole as dessert - perfection."}
{"text":"Dark. loud. Everyone sits an inch away from their neighbor. Can't even hear the waitress."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Tako. The food is so good and different.  The make your own guacamole is insane. All of the fun drinks are amazing too. Especially Decada tequila in the diablo! Spicy but GREAT. The service is excellent and the music is always bumping- so every night the atmosphere makes you happy to be there.  Price is as you would expect for a place with that quality food. The manager there is super helpful and always makes sure we have a good meal. Recommend!"}
{"text":"The service and food was great! I enjoyed the cocktails and the papas bravas were probably the best I have ever had! I can't wait to be back again and try the other tacos on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend when she was visiting Pittsburgh to show her some an iconic restaurant and this restaurant did not disappoint. The vibe was trendy and fun with upbeat music and mood lighting. There were so many different options of guacamole to choose from but we decided to stick to the basic one - absolutely delicious! We then shared a few tacos amongst us, our favorite was the Korean BBQ for its uniqueness and delectable mix of flavors. I highly recommend this place for a swanky night out!"}
{"text":"Update Review: Tako has completely redone their menu. Your old favorites are completely different. They do have some new tacos which are fun, I'd recommend the duck taco. However, they redid the Tako taco- it is terrible!!! Extremely fishy and now deep fried. I have no idea why they would change their menu, especially when it was working. I think the new menu has had an impact on their business because the place was not nearly as busy with many empty seats. You might not need a reservation anymore. Save yourself the heart ache, eat something at home. That's what we'll be doing next time!"}
{"text":"Tako is one my very favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I'm clearly not alone of that - this tiny restaurant is always booked! A reservation weeks in advance is pretty much always necessary. It's worth the wait though for the creative mixed drinks and equally inventive tacos. Tako serves its Asian-Mexican fusion food in a small, dimly lit space with creative decor and danceable music, making it feel as though you've walked into somewhere secret.   If you go to tako and are of age to consume alcohol, I'd say a margarita is a must! The spicy cucumber margarita is fantastically cooling and hot at once. On my most recent visit, I had the coconut margarita - it was a like a margarita and a piña colada had a happy baby. You really can't go wrong, unless you don't order a margarita at all.  As far as food, the tacos are a must. I have had the non-meat taco flavors. I used to love their mushroom taco with huitlacoche but the mushroom taco has since changed so on my most recent visit I opted for the shishito taco which was quite tasty and they managed to squeeze a lot of peppers into two tacos. Side note: the flour tortillas are not vegetarian but the corn tortillas are. My friends and family have also said positive things about the other flavors of tacos. The chorizo taco has been praised for being rich but it has been noted to not be very spicy. And the tako (Japanese for octopus) taco is noticeably octopus tentacle so you have to decide for yourself if that's fun or intimidating."}
{"text":"Love the food, Duck Tacos & Korean BBQ were incredible! Lots of options on margaritas and well worth the dollars spent. Atmosphere is also trendy and upbeat"}
{"text":"Loud, small, dimly lit, always packed.  But hey, tacos. Delicious tacos that is.  The Korean short rib tacos were my favorite of the bunch that I sampled, although I do have to note that I did not try the Tako tacos (octopus).  Just about what you would expect from a taco place by the minds behind Butcher and the Rye, Pork and Beans, etc."}
{"text":"Great tacos (although I think people either love or hate the octopus... personally not a fan).  The restaurant is a lot bigger inside than it appears from the street, and has a neat atomosphere, and they have some really fun and different cocktails! The only reason I woulnd't give 5 stars is that it's a little overpriced for tacos."}
{"text":"I love this place, it reminds of SF and LA, so it's a great step away from typical Pittsburgh. The food is always incredible, as are the drinks.  I give it 4 stars because the food/drinks are so incredible the outweigh the horrendous service I've received here. The bartenders weren't very friendly which is disappointing when you're spending a decent amount for food/drinks and you can barely get service or at minimum a \"how are you\". Also, the acoustics are horrible so it's hard to hear the people you are with, and on a busy day, you basically have to yell to talk.  I'll definitely be back because of the food/drinks but hope I can update this later with a more favorable opinion on the service."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite spot but something was off with the food on Saturday. Our server was Jason and he was wonderful and attentive. He suggested the watermelon basil mocktail and it was delicious.  My husband got his typical fish tacos, but when we got home he told me that they were really fishy. More fishy than salmon. He loves fish including salmon. I find it odd that a white fish would be so fishy. He never spoke up at the restaurant so I never knew anything was wrong til we got home. He didn't get sick but I wonder if anyone else had the same experience.  The DJ was awesome on Saturday. It was probably the best part as well as our drinks and Jason, our server. The food was just not as good as we remembered."}
{"text":"Totally worth the hype. We had a late reservation but ended up getting their early and scoring a seat outside at the bar, looking into the kitchen. Best seats in the house--I highly recommend it. Was entertaining watching them cook and everything from the drinks to the apps and the tacos were a big hit. Personal favorites were the Street Corn and Papas Bravas appetizers and the Octopus Tako appetizer. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best taco places I've been too. In town on business and wanted to have non-Hotel food for dinner. I ordered the Red Sangria. Good. I ordered the Crab Guacamole. Excellent. I also ordered the chicken tacos. Excellent. Good service at the bar and fast. Found a solo seat as soon as I walked inside. Minus one star because this place is dark as in ambiance and dark places torture my soul especially when I'm trying to eat. Otherwise I enjoyed my food and I would recommend for visitors and locals as a great place to eat. Thanks Täk?."}
{"text":"The hot new place in downtown Pittsburgh!  We had a hard time getting a reservation and for my birthday dinner was sure to call about  3 weeks ahead of time for a reservation-yes  reservations are needed for any day of the week.  Once we arrived we had to wait a bit to be seated but it was cool hanging out in the front watching the master chefs at work (they have the kitchen enclose by glass at the front entrance  For our drinks I went with the red sangria which was delicious-the perfect blend of sweetness. My date got a Mexican beer-they beers are reasonably priced at $5 and my sangria was $8. The margaritas are $10 and not huge. For our appetizer we went with the made to order guacamole. There is so much to choose from so we went with the regular house guc and added a cheese-well what we thought was queso but their queso was some sort of shredded cheese. Not what we expected but very tasty. The chips are great as they are not greasy.  For my entree I went with chicken tacos which had big chunks of avocado, cheese, and salsa. The chicken was grilled to perfect and had the best flavor. You get 2 tacos and I wish it was 3 for the price but they were one of the best tacos I have ever had. My boyfriend had to order 2 types  since the portions are small and went with the steak and pork shoulder. The pork shoulder came with grilled pineapple which added the perfect mix of sweet flavor. The steak taco was a really nice cu of sliced steak grilled to perfection.  This would be 5 stars if not for the price & small portions but so tasty I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great! Had the octopus, chicken and pulled beef tacos, classic guacamole and a churro dessert. Amazing tacos - perfectly presented and seasoned! Drinks are good but pricey. Skip the overpriced funnel cake 'churro' and buy another cocktail instead! Only real issue was the woman at the front who took too much pleasure in telling us that we should have made a reservation... We opted to put our name on the waiting list and luckily got a table pretty quick - but it was still early in the evening."}
{"text":"I've heard so many wonderful things about Tako and was able to sneak in on without a reservation on a random Tuesday around Christmas. The drink menu had something for everyone from sweet drinks to spicy options- I got the thai coconut and it was delicious. It was impressive to watch the bartenders make other handcrafted drinks including ones with egg whites! For dinner my friend and I shared the pollo asado and mushroom tacos. The chicken tacos are a classic you can't go wrong with but I much preferred the mushroom. I definitely plan on trying a new type each time I visit and the specials sounded amazing as well. My friend and I plan on coming back with a group to get the taco board in the near future. Highly recommend a stop here if you're look for a more casual dinner but with delicious food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made reservations a month in advance, and when we arrived we were greeted and brought to our table right away. The vibe is very hipster-y and the noise level is pretty loud, although we were still able to hold a conversation. We started with the ceviche and queso fundido. The ceviche had amazing flavor and we both enjoyed it a lot. The queso funded was pretty good, although the cheese hardened very fast so you have to eat it quickly. I ordered the al pastor tacos and my boyfriend and the pollo tacos. We both agreed the al pastor were superior to the chicken ones although they were both very tasty. The only downside was that the food was all pretty spicy, even though we ordered some the least spicy tacos, according to the waiter."}
{"text":"Too dark upstairs. I couldn't see the food, ridiculous! The service was indifferent. The tacos were nothing special but the sides were much more successful. The dessert, a chocolate ganache was dry and a waste of money. There are many other choices for tacos, I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Every taco has a particular taste or style so know what taco your ordering when ordering tacos. Some days I want the Korean taco, others the chicken taco or chorizo taco, but all days I want tacos. Will be back for more tacos."}
{"text":"You must go!  You will love it!  So yummy!  Korean tacos were delightful! White sangria was smooth and tasty!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"One of the greatest challenges to a restaurant that's \"hot\" is to justify it's heat (I sound like the critic in Ratatoullie but without the charm).  Tako really does justify.  Now, first things first...why is it seemingly uncouth in these types of establishments to be well lit?  Are the wait staff hiding horrible acne which may lead patrons to believe that they could very well leak open face wounds onto their dishes?  I can't see anything!!!  Fortunately, I basically knew what I wanted before I went out there.  But yeah, attention restaurants...electricity is relatively inexpensive, add some lights.  I heard that this place was extremely noisy.  It is pretty noisy...but it's not that bad.  Their may be an illusion of noise because the tables on the bottom floor are longer, and therefore you are further away from anyone you would be eating with (what percentage of people have anything interesting to say, really?).  We ordered the mushroom, Tako (octopus), and baja (fish) tacos, along with the lamb quesadilla.  All items came out at the same time (thus justifying the previously mentioned long tacos).  Visually, they were Liv Tyler (remember her?).  That is to say, they were perfect looking.  But looks can be deceiving...in this case, they weren't.  They were awesome.  Here's a subtle compliment, the texture was perfect.  Especially with the tako...they perfectly blended chewy and crunchy with the ingredients...and the octopus was cooked perfectly (for those of you who are octopus shy, it was the consistency of a juicy porkchop).  Delicious.  But surprisingly, this probably wasn't the best.  The best was the little taco that could, the mushroom taco.  I am not even close to a vegetarian, but if all vegetarian fare was that good, I'd be more willing to switch teams than a drunk freshman girl at her sorority initiation (yucky...puns).    Like I said, I can't really complain about the food itself...the restaurant is hip enough...but then again, I was Mr. Magoo in the dark (how's that for an antiquated reference?), so maybe everything looked awful.  Oh, and from what I could tell, they only had one unisex bathroom which pretty much always had someone waiting.  I wasn't aware of codes, but you would think that a restaurant would require more than one toilet (this point is moot if I just missed it).  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Rush:  Technically precise, with a hardcore fan base who believes them to be an all-time great."}
{"text":"With all the hype about this place, and the fact that I had to call a month in advance for a table of 4 before 10PM, I was expecting Jesus to be my waiter and serve me tacos from heaven. That didn't happen.  The place is AWESOME looking, 5 stars for decor. It was very noisy though, I couldn't even talk to the person across from me without raising my voice. The tacos were good, but nothing to write home about. 3.5 star tacos IMO. We tried 4 different kinds, the chorizo were probably the best. Maybe I would return if it was BYOT (bring your own tacos) and I'd swing by Las Palmas, first."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and it never disappoints. Sometimes just for drinks but always for the tacos. Better get reservations a couple of weeks ahead or try your luck at the bar.  I usually order the Tako taco but tonight I went with the Carnitas and Baja tacos.  Per usual both were on point but the Street Corn with the srirachi mayo was fire!"}
{"text":"Tacos to die for!!!! Unbelievable food and drinks! Great atmosphere and music ! Definitely worth waiting as long as it takes to get in!"}
{"text":"We lucked out on our trip to Tako. We called for reservations- but they were booked until 11! Luckily, their outdoor patio seating is not reserved- so we swiped a table fairly quickly.   The menu selection was decent- there were definitely some arrangements of tacos I'd never considered before. But there are also some old standbys for those less adventurous in your party.    I had the chorizo taco complete with a fried egg- delicious but very messy. I also sampled the Korean and the duck confit - each offered their own unique taste- so it was tough to pick a favorite.   The night of our visit the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was on strike and they played a few songs outside- a great addition to our meal!   Overall I enjoyed my visit- but in the end the price felt a little too steep for two taco plates."}
{"text":"First off, the food is excellent. We started with the guacamole and the extremely helpful waitress helped us with the extra fixings. We shared the duck taco as well as the surf and turf taco that happened to be the special that evening. Both were incredibly tasty but also pretty spicy. My wife and I enjoy spicy food so we were okay, but it might be a bit much for someone who is a bit sensitive.   The only issue we had was with sitting at the outside bar. We did not have any reservations but took a chance. We were told when we go there that it was \"first come first serve\" with the outside tables/bar.  However, that is not necessarily the case. When a couple stood up, we took our seats and were almost immediately questioned by TWO managers if we were supposed to be there. Apparently, \"first come first serve\" means you still have to wait until you get called by the hostess. It doesn't make much sense. A little frustrating, but oh well. It was worth it."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  I got the Tako Tacos.  Octopus was perfect texture and just enough sauce and accompaniments to lend to the main event, but didn't overpower.  The guac was super fresh and really tasty.  I wanted an Amstel Light (don't judge) which they didn't have, but the waiter recommended the Lucky Buddha Ale and it was money.  Way better than that Amstel Light would have been.  Good atmosphere, but tables in the bar are a tad close together.  Everyone was very friendly though!"}
{"text":"Ok so the prices might scare you for a taco place but these were definitely the best tacos of my life. Service was fast enough considering how packed they were and this was 5:30 on a Friday - I was surprised we even got a table by how packed it was. Kind of upset that they didn't have a vegetarian friendly queso and also you have to pay $1 or something for them to refill your chips and they definitely do not give you enough chips to start with in comparison to all the dip you get with the order. Wish I had time to try a drink or dessert. Also - way too dark in there. All of my friends were tripping up the stairs because our eyes were not adjusted to the dark. I like ambiance but seriously way too dark. Will definitely be back to try the poke!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for so long! Stopped by one night last year and was (not particularly nicely) told they were booked for the next few days, so I finally made a reservation and came with a few friends this weekend. To keep it short - we were disappointed. I'd heard raving reviews from many friends of mine, and was super excited to try it out, but it fell short on all accounts. To start, getting a reservation was a little difficult. There were so few times available to book that we had to settle on a 3:30 pm time. We wanted to go for dinner but couldn't find reasonable reservation times before around 8-10pm, so we settled on a Sunday afternoon.   Atmosphere and service 2/5: When we got to the restaurant, it was surprisingly pretty empty, probably because of the awkward time. We were seated upstairs in a booth, which was a bit squishy for 6 people but not too terrible. It was really dark inside, not to my personal preference, but pretty standard for restaurants like this. The decorations were unique and interesting, but it's hard to notice much when it's so dark. The first plates we were given were dirty, and there was a large piece of food on one of our plates, but quickly switched out when asked. We were given only three hand towels for 6 people? We also had to ask to get our water replaced because nobody came by to check. Our personal server was polite and friendly, but other servers we interacted with were less amiable. Overall not the most pleasant experience I've had.  Food: 3.5/5 Looking over the menu, things seemed pretty pricy, so I had high expectations going in. Some of the dishes seemed pretty unreasonably priced, and I noticed that their prices seemed to have increased considerably looking at many of the yelp reviews I read. We ended up getting the ceviche and wings to share as starters. The wings were pretty unique, served with pickled carrots and cucumber and other greens, but with a really strong fish sauce smell and flavor that some people in my party really didn't like. They were rather sweet and a little spicy, and the sauce was tasty, but the meat was dry. The ceviche was not very interesting, and the chunks of fish were small and overshadowed by the volume and flavor of the vegetables. The chips it came with were good though.  Moving on to the tacos, we got a big board to share among the table. I tried the Korean taco, the Al pastor, and the duck taco. My favorite was probably the Korean, although none of them blew my mind. The Korean taco was pretty spot on because of the vegetables, but the meat didn't really taste like bulgogi.  On the other hand, the Al pastor had a large mound of meat and just a few pieces of pineapple and cilantro on top. Overall, my friends and I agreed that the tacos were in general too salty. It seemed the flavors were all really powerful but didn't go well together and just mixed and clashed. In addition, they only serve flour tacos with a really strong flour smell, although they were soft. The tacos weren't bad per se, but for $7-8 per taco, we expected a lot more. We left feeling dissatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"Very excited to visit PA and the burg with my good friend tonight. Highly reviewed and highly disappointed...  1st sign of poor management:  Hostess said \"1.5-2 hour wait\" so we went to bar to have a drink to kill time. Actually seated in 25 mins...  2nd sign of poor management:  Bar and restaurant have different menus, Which means you can't transfer from bar to table  3rd sign of poor management:  Total communication confusion between hostess and waiting staff. Waited 8 mins from notification that table was ready to actually being seated.  4th sign of poor management:  We paid two bills (1 at bar and 1 at restaurant)   Manager told us we would receive a free round of drinks for the inconvenience. We never received the \"free\" round of drinks the manager stated he would give us for the poor experience.  5th sign of poor management: Accused the table of stealing a place setting that was located in the bar doggy bag the restaurant placed there...  6th sign of poor management: Manager had to call police to fix his problem... what??  We respect ALL PA employees who are making a difference... just not the ones at Takeo!  Go to Taco Bell instead, spell it however you want..."}
{"text":"This was my third or fourth visit to tako, but the only time I've ever been there during prime weekend hours. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Not because of the food or drink, but because of the way I was treated by the staff, and the poor management of indoor bar seats. I walked in by myself at about 8 PM on a Friday night, hoping to get a drink and a taco before meeting up with some others. I knew I had a small chance of getting a table, so I went in with the mindset of being happy to sit at the bar. When I tried to walk in, the hostess stopped me at the door and asked what I was in need of. When I told her, she sharply told me that there was a waitlist to sit at the outdoor bar and that if I wanted to sit at the indoor bar I would \"just have to wait and see.\" They have tables out on the street too but those were not being used. I went to stand and wait at the bar for a seat, and it was clear that MANY people were using the indoor bar as a place to wait for either an outdoor bar seat or an indoor table. This is totally fine if you are ordering drinks, food, etc., but there were several people just sitting there. I ordered a margarita (very good as always) and informed the bartender that I was waiting on a seat just for me should one become available. As I stood and sipped my margarita for over 30 minutes, hordes of people came into the restaurant, and getting a bar seat became a bit like the hunger games. Still, there were people sitting at the bar seemingly not drinking or eating anything. Another bartender noticed my empty glass and asked if I wanted another. I asked for the check and politely told her that I would have to leave because I hadn't been able to get a seat. She said, \"are you sure? one might open up.\" I am not blaming the bartenders, because I know they were overwhelmed and it can't be easy to kick someone out of the bar if they aren't ordering anything.   Moral of the story? Don't expect to sit anywhere on a Friday night, even if you come alone. Perhaps one solution to this issue would be to employ a waiting list for the indoor bar, too. It's just a small restaurant and the traffic is difficult to control."}
{"text":"Making a reservation was not as tough as I thought it was going to be, but this place was really cool. The atmosphere is great, food was really good, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The tacos had very unique and a lot of flavors which I loved.  If you're looking to get really good Mexican food, this is definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"My partner and I were able to go here for a quick dinner before a PSO concert. We didn't have reservations, but the staff was kind enough to seat us at a reserved table since the reservation wasn't for another half and hour or so and we told them we had to be in and out anyway to be on time for the concert. The interior is awesome, especially the octopus tentacles holding the lights. It's very dim. I loved that you can see the food being prepared inside the kitchen. We didn't have time to try any drinks, but our tacos were amazing and they came out quickly. They are good sized (perfect amount of food) and they're served on a wooden board. We got the Pollo Asado and Al Pastor tacos and shared one of each. The flavors in both were fantastic and they don't skimp on the fillings. I slightly preferred the Al Pastor because of the roasted pineapple. So good. Next time, I want to try the bistec taco and a beverage."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tacos are delicious and filling. Atmosphere of restaurant is great! Love the music and total vibe the place has! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Wait was long but worth it.  The tacos are def a unique concoction as well as their drinks.  Yum! I just wish there's more lighting, the place is quite loud inside too."}
{"text":"Loved the octopus tako, poke, and beet salad. Special salmon tako just ok. Wine list unremarkable but cocktails amazing. The DJ was great. My main complaint w this place is what appeared to be a single bathroom for the entire restaurant that resulted in lines of people waiting the entire night, and crowding nearby tables and bar. The bathroom also lacked a functioning soap dispenser - I don't even want to think about the cleanliness of everyone's hands."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but I'm in love. I've sat both outside and inside. I did prefer inside because of the atmosphere but outside was still fun for people watching. Both times I got the Bistec taco, it is amazing. I'm a pretty picky person and I didn't change anything about this. The food is so fresh and smells amazing. I wish there was more food to an order (2 tacos per order) but that's only because of how good it is. I do get full from the 2 tacos because they are pretty loaded up so wanting more is just me being greedy :) I am not able to drink tequila but I still wanted  a Margarita and the staff was super nice and accommodating about which ones would be best to replace with vodka. The staff is amazing, everyone I've experienced so far has been really friendly! I can't wait to go back and try the guacamole menu and some different tacos!"}
{"text":"Loved täk? so much I went multiple times during my week in Pittsburgh. It was often busy and usually a seat would open relatively quickly.   Shisito Pepper Tacos. Oaxaca old fashioned. That's all you need to know. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were probably my favorite thing... but for $7. The chicken tacos were ok, the guac was ok, the roasted corn was good... the hour waiting for the table was not worth it and then when the waiter forgot to put in our order so we waited another hour and a half for our tacos. I have waited tables in my past and I understand it happens, but the waiter blamed the kitchen, which I feel is disrespectful. Own up to your mistakes."}
{"text":"Korean tacos were awesome! Passion fruit and rosemary sage margaritas were amazing. The Mexican corn isn't worth the price and the guac is the same as everywhere but the tuna poke was SO good. It's cute in there just way too dark. It's very expensive too but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Highly recommend the guacamole mushroom tacos and the whipped cheesecake. Really great all around. Wish we would have been seated upstairs otherwise nice atmosphere. Will definitely return when we can get in again!"}
{"text":"People had been raving to me about Täk? and I have to say that I was rather disappointed when I finally made it there for dinner. It is quite a small restaurant and reservations for dinner go weeks in advance. You can eat at the bar without a reservation and it turns over relatively quickly, but you might be waiting for a bit. You can make a reservation on their website through Yelp SeatMe. I went with my boyfriend and we had to shout at each other and still couldn't really hear one another. It is incredibly loud in there. It is also so dark you can hardly see the menu or what you're eating. The decor is very confused, with some metal lockers, Christian paraphernalia, and black/red decor that might be found in a dungeon. It was rather dreadful of an atmosphere (the bar looks slightly better since it is a tiny bit better lit and you are sitting right next to anyone you go with, which should make hearing them a little easier). We started off with the house-made guacamole and were not at all impressed with it. I had the mushrooms tacos which were quite tasty, but not enough so to go there again. I had a pretty good mezcal-based drink. The prices were quite high for what we were getting."}
{"text":"Tako is an amazing place. From the outside you cannot imagine what's cooking in the inside. You are in for a great tako experience !  The place is vibrant with nice dim lights and loud music. It is also known for its tacos, we ordered four different tacos and ended up getting 8 tacos. The waitress didn't tell us that but we didn't care. The tacos were very good and their cocktails too. We had four and took the remaining four in a box.  Very nice place for a cool hangout with friends!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service from Jasen was excellent. His service was a great way to start and finish our meals. Now for the food and drink. Wonder selection of margaritas as well as other specialty drinks. They do make a good cocktail. As for the food we had guacamole with tuna belly and it was excellent. They have a guacamole menu nice idea. As for the Tako themselves great mix of flavors and as all places some better then others but if you try a new place try something new. The winner last night was the mushroom taco. Absolutely  wonderful. Overall I would say try it you should enjoy. But if you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner this would not be the place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, drinks and customer service! Since opening in Pittsburgh a couple for months ago I have gone at least once a week. The food is amazing the Baja Fish tacos and Crab guacamole are my favorite. From the bar to the tribal and eclectic bathroom this place is a must in Pittsburgh's Cultural District."}
{"text":"I'm way overdue to review tako, as we've been maybe 10 times since it's opening. Each and every time we have had a wonderful experience. When friends visit from out of town, this is always at the top of our list. And now for several of them, it's a must visit when they're back in Pittsburgh. I personally love the sidewalk seating for the warmer months.   The margaritas are some of the best I've had. The grapefruit and sage, the hibiscus and the absinthe and anejo are a few of my favorites. The queso fondido and guacamole are perfect starters and you truly can't go wrong with any of the taco options. What you wouldn't expect is that the poke appetizer is absolutely amazing. I've often just ordered this as my meal. The tuna is so fresh and works perfectly with the rice chips. You must order this if you haven't had it yet!  Service is always consistently friendly and accommodating. Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the city. Richard DeShantz and team can do no wrong! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I revisited Tako without reservations and just as you would expect, getting a seat at the bar was cutthroat. To get a seat at the bar when it opens, it's probably best to get there early and wait outside (expect a line). Despite that, it was so worth it. The food this second time around for me most definitely exceeded my last experience. Seriously, I could eat the items I ordered every single day and not get sick of them. I highly recommend the poke for your appetizer and the bistec tacos for one of your taco choices. The special taco of my visit was a pig ear taco and if that happens to reappear as a special during your visit, I highly recommend it (even if the words \"pig ears\" scare you a bit). Trust me, they're so good!   There's a reason the restaurant is booked for weeks and people stand in line before it even opens. That reason is good food and hip atmosphere. It's a little expensive, but you might find that the quality of food makes it worth the price!"}
{"text":"Tako is a very cool and hip restaurant with good tacos in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. It is my second favorite place for tacos in Western PA (and favorite in the city). It can be difficult to get a table, so make a reservation well in advance or go during off peak hours. I've dined here a few times. I enjoyed the chicken, steak, and fish tacos. The guacamole is excellent. I did not like the Octopus taco. The atmosphere and decor is very cool. It is a little over priced, but worth the visit."}
{"text":"Yahhhh it's as good as everyone says it is. Came here for dinner for a NYC friend reunion. Loved the menu that was a newspaper and the general ambiance. The custom guac and pork tacos with pineapple were TO DIE FOR. You absolutely have to have a reservation here for dinner - good luck otherwise. The inside is pretty small so walkins I heard the hostess quoting a 2.5 hour wait time. It's directly next to Butcher in the Rye so if you wanted to grab a drink before or after, it's a great location.   Only negatives - I'm BEYOND obsessed with coconut but their coconut margarita is BEYOND DISGUSTING. It tasted like tequila with milk. Avoid! Also our server was exceedingly slow. It's possible that tables never turn in this place because the servers are so slow BUT the awesome food is almost worth it. Just don't expect a quick dining experience here."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!! There is AMAZING consistency with the bartenders! They make amazing drinks! We were last there in February and had one drink that we love , and we went back last night n ordered the same drink, we saved time before we had to go back on the road so that we could go here and get that drink! Lol so we went in all excited, ordered it , it came out so pretty and tasted just as perfect as last time (different bartender too)!!  I'm talking about their \"Pimms Cup!\" We love those! They make the best ones! Go Here!!"}
{"text":"I went to Tako with a friend the other weekend right after the Mariners game on Sunday afternoon. We were surprisingly able to get right in, which was great because I have heard so much about this place and have never been when I am in town visiting! Although the place is a little dark inside, the ambiance is great! The chandeliers are made of recycled bike chains which is cool, and it has a fun retro feel with the octopus mural on the wall. I always like being able to see into the kitchen, so watching the food being prepped and cooked while we waited for a few minutes was a plus for me.  I had the Bistec tacos, Mezcal Smash, and Pineapple Jalapeno cocktails. The PJ cocktail was not very spicy like I was expecting, but was delicious nonetheless. Everything on the menu looked great and it was hard to choose! If I had a bottomless stomach I would order one of everything all at the same time. I would definitely getting a reservation if you are coming to town and want to check out this place. Last time I was in town we were not able to get it- this time just happened to get lucky and it is worth it. PS- the Mexican Sprite is just regular Sprite bottled in glass, in case anyone was wondering"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. No duck any more. The service was awesome. Pretty like a bar and the light is a little bit dark."}
{"text":"Tako was ahhhmazing. I ordered my food to go but would definitely come back the next time I'm in town. Loved the tacos and interested in trying the \"froze\" as all of their drinks looked delicious."}
{"text":"Service: Great server who was attentive and gave us food and drink suggestions.  Atmosphere: Dark, industrial, steampunk, loud. We ate dinner around 5pm on a Wednesday. I enjoyed the dim lighting. Visually stimulating with the interesting artwork and fixtures. Too loud for my taste, it gave it more of a bar feel.   Food: Our table of 5 had the chips and guacamole, queso and potatoes. Everyone had tacos, 4 people had drinks, shared the street corn and funnel cake dessert. Flavorful, some things a little too salty, but maybe that keeps people drinking. The funnel cake wasn't that great, however did come with a Mexican hot chocolate that was bomb.com   Value: Steep-a$$ prices for 2 tacos. The food was good, but I kept thinking about the price.   What you should try: Queso, street corn and Korean tacos.  Overall: The meal was enjoyable, but not my scene. Definitely a trendy place featuring tasty Mexican-Asian fusion fare."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were pretty amazing. The octopus taco was incredibly tender and juicy! Not at all like the chewy octopus meat I've had at other restaurants. The special porchetta taco was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the pear slices inside.... Next time I think I will try the mushroom taco that everyone seems to be raving about. My only GRIPE - and this is a BIG one - is that there is no way to make reservations online. One of the other reviewers was correct when she said that often the phone is just not picked up. Come on Tako!!! ( and your next door neighbor Butcher and the Rye) It's the digital age. We should be able to contact you online to make a reservations. I'm busy and I don't have time to keep calling back during the day for someone to finally answer. I want to come back. Make it easier for me!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not worth the price. Had the basic tacos and they were good. Way overpriced though. Two street tacos for $12 is crazy. Beer was affordable. Service was bad. I sat at the bar and took over 10 minutes to get my check. Was not overly packed either. After asking for my check numerous times with no luck, and finally receiving my check, and reminding the bartender to run my card. I was finally able to leave this place."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!  Street corn...I could eat it every day.  It's all good there.  I love it."}
{"text":"There's a reason why there's a line outside this place everyday before it opens... It's AMAZING! All the food is delicious, the tacos and they do a really good job with decoration and setting the mood. I like that you can see the kitchen and how they prepare everything fresh.   The only thing I recommend is calling well in advance since a reservation is pretty much required and not even a week is enough for a party of 2. The wait is well worth it though!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner midweek. Like the relaxed atmosphere and outdoor stools where you can see the kitchen. Good beer and tequila selection. Cocktail list looked good too. Menu is limited to starters and tacos. Ordered the street corn and it was creamy and delicious with some spice. At the recommendation of one of the bartenders I ordered the Bistec (steak) tacos. They did not disappoint!  Quick service too."}
{"text":"They make all of their cocktails with tequila.  Yes, all of them.  When you can start your meal with a nice drink and a customized guacamole order, one would think it would only go downhill from there.  It got better!  I had some version of pork tacos that I let the server pick for me.  I couldn't make up my mind and I was on drink 2 by then.  It was crowded and loud, but thats the thing for here so....... if you don't want a load and boisterous environment where you will be squeezed in between lots of similar folks then do not go here.  If you want a great drink and a taco in a super cool environment..... go often."}
{"text":"This place is legit worth all of the praise it gets! The atmosphere is so cool, and the service is excellent. Our table of 6 shared the make your own gauc, and it was AWESOME! I personally had the bistec taco, and I loved it. Everyone at the table pretty much tried every taco on the list, and no one left disappointed. The spicy cucumber marg is the stuff dreams are made of, so do yourself a favor and get it.   I will say it is pretty dark in there, so if you aren't blessed with 20/20 vision it might be a challenge to see the menu, but I think it's part of the vibe and I was ok with it. It is also quite small, so if you have a larger group you either need to make a reservation or be at the door when they open because it fills up quick."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here the second night it was open and it was amazing! Loved the spicy cucumber margarita! I have been back about once a month and just can't get enough! The el pastor is one of my favorites! Definitely worth making a reservation in advance there is usually a long wait and the restaurant is small."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of tacos. I like to try very different ones that stray away from the traditional toppings. I must say though, the pollo tacos are my favorite. I absolutely love them. You can create your own guacamole which is really neat. This place is a bit pricey but I promise it is worth it. Also, BEST margaritas I've ever had. I'd recommend the watermelon basil (It's just garnished with a basil leaf)! If you like tacos, you must try Tako. If you're in Pittsburgh for your first time, definitely make this one of your stops!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. The only real down side is that it is always busy and a little dark and loud, but I don't really mind any of those things. I LOVE the street corn. For something a little different the octopus taco is great, but I think my favorite is the mushroom. Also, their daily specials are always great.   I always order too much. I can never eat 2 tacos after street corn. I wish I could, but it is not possible. The best reheated taco is the mushroom.   Drinks are great too, any of them. I haven't had one I didn't like."}
{"text":"The food and service at Tako was 5 stars, the drinks were a 3; decor was amazing, however, the volume of the music just made our meal unenjoyable.  An avid concert go-er, I don't mind a party, but I like to talk at dinner.  We shared the guac which was great, chips had perfect amount of salt, chicken, Korean and al pastor.  All were good, Korean was clear winner for taste- it was excellent.  The drinks were distinctive and creative, but not great.  Our server was knowledgeable and prompt with service. Price was very reasonable for downtown and volume of food.  I understand why restaurants crank up the music (you drink more because you can't hear what other's are saying so you don't talk and it helps tables turn faster), but I just didn't like having to eat my tacos in silence because a conversation would be pointless.  I'd get the food and eat on the patio again, but won't be back inside again."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff - they refilled waters and drinks with great attention. Then the food - we had chips which came with 3 different sauces with varying spice levels. The chips were very generous, my dining partner and I barely made a dent on them. The tacos were good - I had octopus, he had steak. It was a great dinner. But keep in mind, this restaurant is very popular and gets packed, so be sure to plan ahead and make a reservation. We sat at the bar and were very happy with that."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Bistec tacos are my fav, but anything with seared tuna is always a good choice as well. Try to hit the late night menu if you can!"}
{"text":"Tako was awesome!! The interior is novel and interesting and the staff work together very effectively. We loved the grapefruit sage and spicy cucumber margaritas. The guacamole wasn't the best we've ever had but the chips were terrific and a huge serving. The street corn is incredible - seriously, a must order - as we're the potatoes. We loved the spicy chorizo tacos and can't wait for a chance to visit again."}
{"text":"Tako lives up to the hype. The atmosphere and service are both trendy and unique. The Korean taco's flavors play well together. The Baja taco, a fish taco, is better than your average fish taco. Its location downtown is convenient to all things sports and and cultural. Only loses one star because it can get very crowded, given the limited size of the place."}
{"text":"As always the Tacos were great. We tried the Pollo asado and Baja this time. There was a special - crab and egg yolk dip with chips which wasn't good."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and top notch service. The cocktail list is out of this world. Loved the guacamole and chips, everyone really liked the tacos. We had Chorizo, Baja and Chicken Asada"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with awesome food. Love the Al Pastor taco and the Chorizo tacos! Great atmosphere with really cool decor. If you are in Pittsburgh definitely go here but make reservations well in advance especially for larger groups and weekends!"}
{"text":"This place has been so hyped for about a year now that I was so excited to finally have a reservation.  Called on a Friday just to see what the deal was; surprisingly they said they could fit us in for 9:30, but scheduled for 10 days later to get a better time.  Bottom line-(though I think it is a bit overhyped) if you still even have an inkling of wanting to go, make a reservation well ahead of time.   My friend arrived before me and had not been acknowledged to be seated, but once I told he host of our reservation, we were seated right away.  I liked the outdoor seating, but am not sure if weather affects their reservations; there is also a small bar on the outer wall as well as an indoor bar.  My major complaint was that, while it is a small place, there was only 1 bathroom, and not really a lot of room to wait around it (unless there was also 1 upstairs that the waitress I asked neglected to mention).   They have a separate drink list in addition to the margaritas and other regulars on their main menu. If for nothing else, I would definitely go back to try a few other margarita flavors, as they had a very unique selection--I got the aloe/elderflower margarita, which I really enjoyed when comparing to the typical very sweet and fruity flavors offered at other places.    Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. For appetizers he recommended the Poke and the Street corn--we went with the street corn as a friend had also recommended this to me, and while I was not expecting the corn to come out on the cob (making it a bit difficult to eat), it was absolutely delicious, topped in cheese and other spices.  As for the chips and salsa, loved the chips which seemed authentic and the right amount of saltiness, though I felt their salsas were okay.   For my entree I had the carnitas taco, going against getting the Korean as I was recommended.  They were good, juicy and flavorful, but I can't say they were the BEST tacos I've ever had, which is what I was expecting from all the reviews the place gets and it being named Tako and all. If I had gone in with lower expectations maybe I would feel differently.  Ultimately, I would go back; I would love to go back to the bar, I would also go back for the food, but having to wait 2 weeks to get in just doesn't feel right."}
{"text":"There isn't a bad item on the menu, and every time we're there, we find a new favorite!  The barbacoa taco special was absolutely incredible -- the best taco I've ever had."}
{"text":"Unique & tasty food that is thoughtfully prepared!  I got the mushroom taco (one order comes with two tacos) and it was stuffed with all kinds of tasty things - creme, Brussels sprout salad, mushrooms, etc.  The chips & salsa trio came with options for my whole table - mild, medium & hot (it's a tricky hot because it starts out somewhat sweet thanks to some honey and then builds).   Check out their generouselection of Mezcals.  As our server described it - \"You know how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are square.  Same thing applies here. All tequilas are mezcal, but not all mezcals are tequila.\"  Really fun, but dark interior and has outside seating."}
{"text":"Scored some outdoor seating in late summer. It was great to sit on the street and also watch the chefs at work.  Tacos were great - vegetarian mushroom options were fabulous but the fish tacos looked great. I have heard the octopus tacos are fantastic.  Also got the guacamole - heard it was a must do and wasn't let down."}
{"text":"I never write these, even though I use Yelp all the the to find good food.  The only reason we gave 1 star was because there's no negatives.  Looks cool and nice so we stopped for a snack, I love good tacos. Ordered the duck because I am familiar with duck tacos from someplace else down south that were amazing best taco ever. This place after 2 bites each of us both said no way!!! Got back to the hotel and almost simultaneously started throwing up.  Not good in a 1 room hotel bath room.  We did not have to much to drink. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This might be the best spot in Pittsburgh! Great good and great atmosphere! The guacamole and Täk? tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Gave this place 5 stars the tacos are amazing and full of flavor.  The guacamole is also really good!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After talking about going to täk? for over a year, my friends and I made it out last month - and we only just made it, because even this long into their run this place was HOPPING. I couldn't get a reservation in advance and we were lucky enough that there was outdoor seating on a relatively mild November night. Otherwise, I wouldn't even be writing this review.  I admit, once we got our food we understood why this place was so freaking busy. I came with a group of four in total, and we ordered a variety of tacos and appetizers to split. Nothing disappointed. Everything that came to us was fresh, crisp, tangy...whatever word you'd expect each ingredient to be, that ingredient met expectations and then some. And the flavor combinations of everything resulted in delectable dishes all around.  We kicked off our meal with their tasty bravas and cocktails, all of which put us in a very good mood - the kind of good mood that the best food inspires. And when the tacos themselves arrived they did not last long at all. The baja fish tacos stand out in my mind as the tastiest item of the night, almost making me regret ordering my mushroom tacos for the night. Almost - the mushroom tacos here are not to be underestimated, as a well-cooked mushroom is a mighty force. I think someone actually tried and loved the octopus tacos, which I skipped entirely. That food is not for me. But based on the way vegetables and fish alike were prepared, no matter what they make these cooks know how to make it right.  We ended the night by ordering a round of drinks for the staff after work - yep, this is an option that you have added to your bill, so when you visit, budget accordingly so you can spoil the cooks. They really truly deserve it.  Needless to say, my gang loved this place - we loved how easy it was to share dishes, and we loved the fact that the dishes were so good that we had a hard time even sharing them. I definitely recommend coming here when the weather is nice and asking to sit outside - while waiting to grab seats I saw the interior of täk?, and it was too dark and too loud for my taste. Maybe it's not usually like that? But if it is, I'd much rather eat here after rush hour. Tacos and cocktails on the sidewalk...sounds like a great night out to me!"}
{"text":"Yummy mushroom tacos!  Everything else coming out looked awesome too, and I love the open concept and decor.  What a cool spot!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but not great.  The atmosphere is good, but the tables are really jammed in. The tacos were just ok.  Nothing great.  Fresh ingredients. You HAVE to order two tacos at a time which sucks if you want to try a couple different kinds and the people who are with don't want to split something.  So you may end up overspending.  We got a frozen alcoholic drink and it was not good at all.  There were trying too hard to combine a bunch of tastes together and it did not work.  I would come back, but I won't go out of my way. I would much rather go to Smoke in Lawrenceville and get their tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I've been here a few times and food and service continue to get even better.  Four of us shared the big board of tacos and everyone enjoyed it.  The squid taco was fabulous!  The guac is the best, especially the one with raw tuna and nori...can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Very cool ambiance! The queso was phenomenal. They only serve the queso with 4 small taco tortillas and they charged us extra when we asked for another basket of tortillas since we had a party of 4 people. The tacos were good. I had the chicken tacos and the chicken was kind of cold but my friend has the Tako taco and the meat was amazingly tender (not what we expected) so that was great. Service was good as well. Make sure to reserve well in advance because they're always busy! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"VERY CROWDED and LOUD.  boutique eatery.  better menu than the place next door for sure.  loud as hell for dinner hour, but we knew that at the door and elected to stay.  food places should not turn up music till 11pm or later.  greeting could have been more friendly.  hour wait at 10pm for a table of TWO is cuckoo.  we went to the bar, shimmied seats and ate there.  could have been greated more friendly by barstaff.  not rude just not congenial until the BT realized we knew a common party.  service with a smile was better after recognition of a mutual contact.  could use some improvement with speed of drink service (frequent empty glasses and bottles without proactive asking for paid \"refills\") but food service was pretty quick.  it was busy, but i've seen much better hustle at a bar.  delicious food but too hot and portion problems for the price point.  one ordered pork taco and the other chix taco.  both were good but too hot (and i like spicy food).  wouldn't order the chips and salsa again--waaayyyyy too salty and NOT warm, sauces were nothing to write home about.  if someone gave me the recipe i'd throw it away.  and no pico de gallo on the menu?????  say whaaaa?   beer prices were reasonable.  spirits were not...seemed pricey (i've been all over the country), less expensive as NYC, DC, LA, et but as it should be...too much for the burgh, even a new, swanky place.  i found out the owner of meat and potatoes (the most rude service i have experienced in the burgh) owns tako--hence i had no surprises.  would come back for drinks pregame only.  not enough value for $$ and while the price points themselves were reasonable...the food was WAY skimpy, you'll leave hungry if you don't order several courses.  people that live in pittsburgh will overrate this place and consider this a hit upscale since its new and trendy.  they're not used to these kinds of eateries that only recently popped up. i live in nyc.  i would not consider this upscale.  though everything is relative.  i might call it trendy however."}
{"text":"We tried to get a seat as walk-ins on the first night, bad idea. So we went to Butcher next door and I grumped about it. I was a little salty but I came by for a second attempt on night number 2. We waited just a few minutes and somehow managed to get a table. Maybe they could tell I was desperate. The ambience is fantastic and for being the second night the service was flawless.   We had several types of margaritas. I really liked the frozen passion fruit but if you like cachaca try the pineapple Batida. The custom guacamole is an awesome concept and adding that perfectly cooked bacon along with mango and pineapple was mind altering. The chips were hot and salty and perfect.   Next came the wings... In a fish sauce caramel. OMG. They're everything I could ever ask for and reminded me of the first fish sauce wings I had at PokPok. All of the tacos were delicious but perhaps a little spicy for the average palate. I like spicy, so a lot of them ended up on my plate. The beef in the Korean taco melted in my mouth and the duck confit was superb. I am so happy I didn't let me first turn away experience stop me. I'm really excited to have a new place to enjoy downtown."}

{"text":"I LOVE this place. We sat at the bar inside one time and we sat at the bar outside one time. Oh my gosh. The bar seating outside watching the kitchen prepare food was amazing. Such an experience on its own, but then to get handed your food right from them! Oh my. We loved it.   We ordered the classic chips and salsa. Yum! And the chip portion was large! Then I ordered the carnitas tacos and he ordered the..shoot I can't remember the name but it's the first taco choice on the list of tacos. We split them and my god I could not pick which one I liked more. They were both amazing in their own right.   Then because I saw one being made as I ate my amazing tacos I just had to get the choco taco dessert. Boy am I happy I did. It was amazing. It's a cone taco shell with ice cream in it and cherries on the plate. My advice is to top each bite with some of the cherries, you won't be sorry.    The atmosphere is awesome. The people working there are friendly and wonderful. The food is the tops. If you only have one place to eat while in Pittsburgh I would make it this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. The food is great and also moderately priced. The drinks were tasty as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for our 3-year anniversary, as we've been trying to get reservations for the last year or so. I was super excited, but that feeling quickly faded for both of us as the evening went on.   First, the service was pretty mediocre.  Dude kept cutting off our sentences and came over whenever he felt like it despite it being later at night and not incredibly packed.  I asked for a drink recommendation that wasn't too sweet, and he recommended what was probably the sweetest drink on the menu.  Strike one.   Second, the make your own guacamole was delicious but I think $18 for an appetizer is ridiculous.  We got bacon in it and they were these giant chunks that were hard to pick up. No. Strike two.   Third and most disappointing was their signature \"Tako\" made with octopus.  I'm amazed that everyone on yelp seems to be in love with them because we both almost threw up at whatever licorice-flavored oil or sauce was on the taco.  This flavor was NOT indicated on the menu and when I asked the sever about it he basically looked at me like I was crazy, as did the two rude women sitting next to us.  We didn't eat the tacos and nothing was taken off the bill or offered to make right.  I don't complain about food very often, but when you're paying $16 for two tiny tacos and you've already spent $100 on food, consideration would be nice.   Strike three.    The two star rating instead of one comes from their Choco taco dessert - amazing.  However, after getting home I became sick.  it's just too many flavors and too much stuff.  If you want an amazing taco, go to Doce Taqueria in the SS and save about 85 bucks.    I like to think that people in burgh know good food, but the yelp rating of this place tells me otherwise.  Not sure why this place is so hard to get into when there are so many other amazing places to go.  If only the restaurant would have put forth half as much effort as my wonderful boyfriend to give me a wonderful experience..."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal at Tako to celebrate my husband's birthday. We made reservations thru Yelp for a party of 5. Ordered a wide variety of appetizers including Chips & Salsa, Guacamole, Street Corn and Papa Bravos -- all excellent. The chips were warm and crisp, served with 3 types of salsas -- salsa de arbol / roasted tomatillo / tomato poblano.  Guacamole can be customized to your taste however we just went with the basic Chef's Choice recipe. The Street Corn and crispy potato Papa Bravos were big hits. Everyone ordered a different type of taco -- Baja, Carnita, Bistec & Al Porter -- everyone enjoyed their entrees.  Highly recommend reservations.  Cool vibe and strong drinks. Outside seating option is along the sidewalk as well as bar facing the kitchen.  Reservations highly recommended."}
{"text":"Top notch!!  Korean Tacos awesome as well as street corn. Atmosphere is great. And tequilas are superb."}
{"text":"It tastes like what it looks like. Perfect! If you choose to sit out next to the counter, you can watch the chefs peeper your food!  Their drinks are also v good."}
{"text":"I had dinner at täk? with a friend a couple weeks ago, and I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!  We started with chips and salsa - generous portion and all three salsa varieties were unique and yummy. I had the mushroom takos as a main course, and they were SO good - easily the best tacos I've ever had and I'm still fantasizing about them! Also had a delicious michelada.  The decor is really interesting and fun. It was kind of crowded and loud, but I guess that comes with the territory for a hip new restaurant. You'll definitely want a reservation, even for a weeknight.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of six a few nights ago.  The food was as I had been told, absolutely delicious.  The girlfriend and I each ordered a different taco and then swapped when they arrived.  Our waiter didn't make us wait for anything, but he was definitely trying to turn the table over as soon as he could.  As soon as we say he was on us about ordering. Then as soon as we had finished our food he arrived with the checks.  No question about a second round of drinks or even dessert.  I wish I had caught his name, so I can know to avoid him next time."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city!  Awesome, unique atmosphere and great drinks.  Doesn't even come close to Smoke or Bakersfield. Only thing is you NEED to have a reservation or else you'll be eating dinner at 9:30 PM.  Otherwise, hands down the best place in the 'Burgh for tacos."}
{"text":"Make your reservations for sure because this place is always busy! For a good reason too. The specialty drinks are amazing, the food is fantastic and the vibe is super cool and trendy. You will not be disappointed at this downtown spot!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I'm really sad about the menu changes though. You can't build your own guacamole anymore which I felt like really set the restaurant apart. The duck tacos are a thing of the past unfortunately too. Yes, the food is still overall delicious, but with the increased prices we spent $78 for two taco orders (from the lower end of the price range), house guac, a sangria, and a margarita."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED the process from reservation to dinner!   The communication via text and emails were so helpful.  But the best part was the wait staff and the FOOD!  We cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Everything. Amazing.   Very busy so go early and grab a seat at the bar before it fills up instantly or make reservations. Also available for delivery on Postmate.com!"}
{"text":"Yum!! I love the carnitas tacos and the ambiance of this place. I especially love eating outside. You must try the watermelon basil marg-soo good!"}
{"text":"Love their tako taco! Very nice service. It is hard to get in without reservation. We made the reservation via Yelp but hardly got a parking spot on Saturday night. Therefore I came in first while my hubby went parking. They let me sit down first and did not bother to ask when my hubby would arrive. The waiter was very nice and introduced us the dishes when I asked more questions."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner, it was fantastic! Loved the build your own guacamole, the drinks were fantastic (we did margaritas), and you won't find better tacos in the city. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place. Finally had a chance to go for lunch. Had several varieties of their tacos- chicken, beef and fried bacon (OMG!)-- they were simply amazing. They definitely did not short me on the portions and the flavor was incredible. I enjoy talking to waitstaff and bartenders to get a better sense of restaurants. The workers at Taako were very passionate about the place. Loved to hear that because my meal reflecting their love of the place. Since I went there for lunch I did not partake in any of their liquor ( had to go back to work ). I did speak to the bartender and it seems they have quite the selection, especially some intriguing varieties of tequila and sangria. Can't wait to return for happy hour."}
{"text":"We started with guacamole and margaritas and then ordered the baha tacos and the pork belly tacos.  Everything we had was delicious!  It wasn't cheap by any means ($16 for the guacamole and I think $12+ for each set of tacos), but it was worth it!  Our waiter was friendly also!"}
{"text":"Erica, our server was awesome. The octopus was done well, but somewhat lacking on flavor. Korean taco was amazing. Guacamole was also fresh. Great atmosphere! A must!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite restaurants. We just keep coming back and the food is delicious. The Korean taco is my personal favorite, but the chorizo, baja, and tako tacos are wonderful as well.  For appetizers, we have had the street corn, poke, the make your own guacamole, and the chips and salsa. All were amazing! If you have room after the main course, the tres leches is awesome and is definitely worth a try.       For those who are of legal drinking age, the sangrias and margaritas are the bomb! Service is always good and they usually have a DJ playing music which is fabulous. It's a bit dark in the restaurant and the music is loud, but it sets almost a club-like atmosphere I personally do not mind.      We always make a reservation about two or so months in advance. Their reservations fill up fast. If you are a foodie, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside but expensive. $12 for two (2) tacos and $10 for a vodka soda. This is still Pittsburgh. The tacos are mediocre and drinks the same. Nicely presented but I have had better tasting for less or equal cost."}
{"text":"Congrats on your opening!! Arrived at 6pm and told the patio was first come, first serve. Awesome!! Attempted to sit at an empty table, but we were told it was reserved. We did leave our name and number and at 8:30 returned back to four empty tables outside. We did ask to sit down and unfortunately they are booked until 10:30 although these are for walk ins...good luck"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! I love the tako tako!  Always delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. The tequila old fashion is out of this world."}
{"text":"To be honest, based on this experience, this place is a little bit over rated. The salmon we had wasn't fresh, the sauce on the pork ear taco was too sweet. But the tuna was pretty decent. The presentation of the food was so so. And the waiter was grumpy which made it kinda unpleasant. But the manager was very nice and took the salmon dish off from the bill after we told him how we felt about it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! One of my best friends and I treated ourselves to tacos and margaritas - we got there right at 5 and had no problem getting a seat, though the restaurant filled up quickly. The chicken tacos were outstanding, and the watermelon basil margarita was refreshing and delicious. Awesome vibe and decor, too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a trendy, innovative addition to the Pittsburgh food scene.  The tacos are delicious and creative and so are the cocktails."}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite place in Pittsburgh. I don't know how they do it, but their tacos are fantastic. I have yet to try something on the menu that wasn't incredible. The chef's attention to detail is superb. I also really enjoy the semi-open kitchen.   The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but it's still very welcoming. At times, it can be difficult to be seated, but I'm not complaining, because their food makes up for any inconvenience.   The staff is pleasant, knowledgeable, and genuine. They are all familiar with the menu, and they take pride in their work. It's apparent that everyone at this restaurant loves the food.   The prices here are reasonable and commensurate with the portion sizes that they offer. They also have a fairly extensive drink menu, which caters to their Mexican theme. Overall, I strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and relying heavily on help to find my new spots, naturally I had to check out what's known as the best spot of tacos in town. Tacos are my favorite food and everywhere I go I make its my mission to have the best tacos in town. I was extremely disappointed in my experience at Tako. The tacos were very average, and a bit over priced. They did have fun and interesting ingredients, however, the recipes were not executed well. On top of that, the service was not good, and this is coming from someone who worked in the restaurant business for 3.5  years. The server acted annoyed about any questions we had on the menu, (I always ask my server what's best since they seem to always know) and took forever to bring us anything, including our drinks and chips and salsa. I would have to say this place is not worth the hype."}
{"text":"The queso appetizer was amazing. The octopus taco was unbelievably delicious (how did they make the octopus so tender??). And a portion of the cost of our drinks went to charity! Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Factory for dollars. In out. Fill a table. Empty a table. A little pricey. Worth it on a special occasion. Good eats though. Impersonal service, but nice managers. Tasty tacos n drinks. Would again."}
{"text":"If I was writing this review a year ago, it would have been 5 stars.  I've been to tako about 10 times since they have opened, and sadly I feel like my last 2-3 visits were subpar at best.  Ive always loved the margaritas here- and have tried just about all of them, but the last time I was there they took one of my favorites off of the menu and the grapefruit and sage margarita that has always been my favorite tasted very different.  One of my other favorites is the street corn in a bowl.  We would dip chips into it and it was always fantastic.  The last few times I was there they were serving it on the cob and it wasn't nearly as good. And I feel as though the tacos have just slowing going downhill as well.  The staff here are always very friendly and provide great service, which is part of the reason I am still giving 3 stars.  I probably won't be returning anytime soon, but sure hope tako can improve some of these things because it definitely used to be one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"My 28 year old niece from SF chose Täk?,  while recently visiting me (63) in PGH. I had given her an option of 3 restaurants in the Cultural District,  before a recent Mary Chapin Carpenter concert. Inside, Täk? is dark, loud, casual and relaxed. The Korean Tacos were delicious and the service was attentive. I would definitely return to try other options. I now understand why everyone gives Täk? rave reviews."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had to make a reservation a month in advance to get a table at a reasonable hour (read not after 9pm) on a weekday so my expectations were very high. First, the vibe is very cool and the decor is really spectacular. The service was fantastic and the drinks were excellent. I had the caparhinia and my friends got margaritas.  On to the food.. We started with the build your own guacamole, which was very good. Then we decided to share the taco board ( 6 pairs of tacos). We chose the tako, mushroom, al pastor, baja, carnita, and Korean. All of them were good. None of them were 4 or 5 star worthy. They relied way too much on creamy toppings so they all sort of tasted the same. It was disappointing. I might be back for drinks but the food is definitely not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"If you're looking for expertly made cocktails and a light snack or dinner after work, this is a great place for it. I'm a fan of the dark ambience, but it is very small inside. We were lucky enough to snag two spots at the bar without calling ahead for a table, and I think I would have preferred the bar anyways.   The build your own guacamole was tasty and unlike any other offering I've seen in the city. Every cocktail we tried was made perfectly. At places like this, I always am fearful that the cute-and-fancy cocktails are going to be gag-worthingly sweet, but none of them were. The bartenders also know what to recommend based upon your taste profile/preferences. And, they know what they're doing with mezcal.   I ordered the bistec tacos as recommended by one of the bartenders. I was excited for them to arrive but unfortunately the cut of meat I received on them was very fatty. I'm only speaking based off of my one time trying an entree, but if I had to pick Bakersfield tacos or Tako tacos, I would choose Bakersfield.   I still would come back for drinks and guac any day of the week."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Had the polo asada and the bistec. Both were really good but the bistec was fantastic! Chips and salsa was also solid. Definitely would recommend getting a reservation. We lucked out, walked up when they cancelled someone else's reservation & got seated outside right away."}
{"text":"Went at 8 pm with a reservation, decently crowded for a Sunday. I started with a spicy passion fruit margarita which was delicious and my mom got the standard blood orange, good, but I liked the libations of the day.   We wanted to try a few things on the menu so we got two appetizers and an order of Korean tacos, which was way more than enough for two people. We got the queso which was sooooo good and unique. It came with chips (hot, salty and crispy) and a few soft tortillas. The queso itself had flavorful beef, cilantro and some peppers in it. A little goes a long with with this stuff, you wanna eat more but it's so filling!   The papas are another app we got which seemed like crispy fingerling potatoes covered in the same stuff as the queso. Maybe we could have been more diverse, but still delicious and carb filled :)  Korean tacos were really good, but didn't stand out. Too much sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place. It us very nice in summer time. Open Kitchen  you can see what they doing fir you. I order Tako, salmon taco, and corn street. It was excellent. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I was speechless after eating at täk?. The tacos are very gourmet, but are an amazing combination of textures and flavors. I will be going to Pittsburgh very soon for business and will be sure to stop in again! I had 2 tacos and a nice cold corona and it filled me up!   I unfortunately was not able to eat indoors because we sat at the bar outside, but it was an amazing view because you can see all the kitchen crew prepare the different type of tacos. 5 stars! Loved it! And in the heart of the city."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very hip and cultural. The decor is amazing a must get is the Mexican funnel cake."}
{"text":"Best taco restaurant I've been to. I'm from Southern California, so my standards for tacos are pretty high, but tako's are incredible.   I ordered the carnitas tacos and loved it. The quality of the meat and the flavor that came with the toppings sold me. I also got the queso, which was a great starter choice. For dessert, I ordered the tres leches. I really liked the peaches and unique flavor that came with it, but I don't think I would order it again.   I've been wanting to come to tako for a long time, but the long wait always made me resort to another restaurant. But thankfully, there was no wait on a Tuesday around 10pm. Until then, I thought tako was another overhyped restaurant, but after my first visit, I think I would wait the long queue.  --  taste / 5 aesthetics / 5 vibe / 4 service / 5 price for quality / 5 OVERALL / 5"}
{"text":"If you're downtown Pittsburgh this is definitely a must to see. They have a unique variety of tacos. Exotic flavors,strange flavors, and they're all great. I've been there several times ordered every single taco and I've never gone wrong with anyone. If you get there at the busy times it is a wait. But it's well worth it.  tako's great place to be"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty incredible. No doubt about that. However, I was pretty disappointed with the staff. I made reservations for 8:30 on a Sunday. When we arrived, the staff were less than cordial to say the least. The first thing that anyone said after seating us was that the kitchen was closing soon so we'd better order now if we wanted food. They then proceeded to try and talk us out of ordering the big board of tacos so that they didn't have to make them. Then, when we ordered the big board anyway, they proceeded to bring drinks, appetizers, and all of our food out at once. All of the servers waiting on us and delivering food acted like we were an inconvenience to them. The food was good. I'll give them that. But next time, I'll keep my $160 and go someplace where the people running the restaurant can treat their patrons with some respect."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. The atmosphere is very unique and I love it. You feel like you are eating at a hidden secret taco speakeasy somewhere in an Asian inspired Mexican village.  The music was awesome, the homemade chandeliers made out of used bike parts were very unique, the staff was very friendly, but best of all, the food was awesome.  I had the best gauc I ever had with mangos and tons of crab meat.  My wife and I split a smoked salmon tostado which was the best smoked salmon I ever had. While this may sound crazy, we didn't get any tacos during this visit. We were stopping by after visiting a few other spots and already ate but were lucky to get a table (most of time time you need to reserve in advance) so we just had some apps. We will be back again and eat tacos for sure!"}
{"text":"This is complete fusion and not authentic at all.  If you are looking for Mexican flavors, I would go somewhere else.  Its fun as an experiment, but I really can't see myself going back as the chicken taco was not nearly as flavorful as it should of been.  However, the ambiance is great and the DJ is fun.  The space is small and and a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Been here twice and enjoyed the atmosphere, cocktails, and food immensely! The vibe is super cool and mysterious. The food is amazing. My favorite is the one with octopus, but a little overpriced. The chorizo taco, duck taco, and shishito peppers taco are all great too. The street corn is awesome when they have fresh corn on the cob. It's not as good when corn on the cob is not in season, and they use can corn served in a bowl."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised to be saying this, but täk? was worth the hype. I made a Friday night reservation for four on a whim a few months ago and had all but forgotten about it until I got a text reminder from Yelp, so I rallied some friends (four friends plus myself = party of 5, for which the restaurant was extremely accommodating when I called them that day) and headed downtown. We were seated quickly upstairs, which provided ample opportunity for people watching and yelling across the wide booth at each other over the loud DJ-curated playlist of the evening (which--spoiler alert--might be my only real complaint about täk?). We started with drinks, of course, and while my friends enjoyed the red and white sangrias, I'm in the midst of a burgeoning love affair with mezcal, so the lychee and pepper margarita was just the ticket for me. We started with the queso fundido and classic guacamole (pro tip--the queso comes with the most pillow-like tortillas, and the guac comes with a basket of chips which make for perfect queso-dunking once the tortillas sadly run out), and I got the carnitas tacos... mmmm. A pork lover's dream, the carnitas were melt-in-your-mouth buttery with the chicharrones on top to provide some flavor/texture balance. Overall, täk? made for a worthwhile (and return-worthy) Friday night out on the tahn ;)"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Tako! Tonight was the second time I have visited Tako and it is easily becoming one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! Both times I have gone during the week with my girlfriends. If you are looking to go here you basically need to make reservations weeks in advance... but it is so worth the wait.  The atmosphere inside of Tako is unlike anything I have ever seen before. From walking in and immediately seeing the cooks making their famous tacos, to the dim lighting and candle lit tables.  This place is sure to catch your eye. Both times I visited we were sat upstairs in the booths. I love that it is a private & intimate setting!   We actually ended up having the same waiter both times I was there! He was very attentive & helpful. Tonight he recommended the watermelon basil margarita for my drink which was AMAZING! I have also tried the grapefruit sage margarita & my girlfriend got the sangria- you basically can't go wrong with any of their cocktails. To start, we ordered the queso fundido. I recommend to order this with tortilla chips instead of the warm tortillas that is typically served with. This is LITERALLY finger licking good. I am obsessed.    For meals on both occasions I ordered tacos.....duh. My friends and I split the Korean, al pastor, and chorizo tacos a few months ago. We loved all of them, but I probably wouldn't order the chorizo again (we all agreed the texture & the fried egg we could do without). Tonight I had the carnitas, which were to die for. I truly believe you can't come to Tako and not have a great experience. There is nothing bad I can say about this place. Everyone needs to go to Tako!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Great outdoor seating.  Food was a fantastic experience - Asian take on tacos.  Reservations strongly recommended, however we were accommodate with very little wait."}
{"text":"Super hip and trendy place that we had to check it out. We did have to make reservations as it  was popping with people. Unfortunately, we didn't specify where we wanted to sit so we got stuck with the bar table outside. The interior was decked out with crazy decor and dim yet colorful lighting that created a unique atmosphere.     I got the Duck Confit taco. The duck was tender and the hoisin sauce provided just enough tang while the pickled peppers and cucumber cut through the richness of the meat.   Even though it was really delicious, my two small tacos were $14. If you go here, don't expect to be super filled. You pay for the experience and the taste of unique flavors."}
{"text":"The food and drinks at Tako are a solid 3. The service, particularly by Jacen, and the fun decor bring it to a 4.  This place is fun -- love the ambiance with its big bulbs, tako/octopus themed play on meaning, crazy religious-Mexican drive-in feeling.  But by New York standards, the food and drink are just good, not great.   The Taco Situation: Tako: It's a bit flat -- the octopus could use a touch more charring, the greens and oil used bring down the overall taste, and you're left wanting more flavor pow! with each bite.  Duck Confit: I didn't love the pairing of duck and hoisin sauce. The sauce took over a bit too much.  Korean: The hoisin sauce took over way too much with the Korean taco. And I couldn't taste any kimchee in there. It didn't have any hints of Korean flavor at all, really.  The Guac Situation: The chef's special crab, mango guac was okay -- could barely taste the crab because the jalepenos were way overpowering. Not to mention those 'penos practically burned my lips off.  When in Pittsburgh, Tako is a perfect stop in if you're looking for a fun vibe and some tequila!  And be sure to ask for Jacen if you sit for food!  Thanks, Yelp, for the good find!"}
{"text":"This was my fav restaurant to visit during my brief stay in Pittsburg.  Loved the atmosphere. The service was great and the place stayed packed.  The tacos were superb.  Drinks were perfect. It's been a while since my visit and I can't remember the name of my dinner items but I would definitely recommend this place be added to your food tour iteniry."}
{"text":"Ok this place is bomb.com  The guacamole is build your own, but they have ready made options for you if it all seems too overwhelming. The chips are very good and so is the guac. I still give Bakersfield the win on guacamole in Pittsburgh. However, holy smokes are the tacos ahhhhmazing. Tried the Al Pastor and the Baja. The Baja will delight you!  It has a bit of heat, sweet, and an absolutely wonderful rendition of tartar sauce that will rock your socks. The Al Pastor is pork shoulder, pineapple, and other delicious concoctions. The winner of the two for me would be the Baja. I will update my review once I try more dishes, but Tako is a winner and will not disappoint...a must try!  ----  Guess who's back with an update?  The street corn. Just go get you some. Ahhhhmazing. Holy. Does Jesus work in this kitchen?  When I say I want some of this everyday of my life, I'm not kidding you.   The chicken taco has now blown my Baja taco out of the first place ranking. Insanely delicious. Just try it. No regrets. I promise.   Service was stellar (Jason) and my company made the night all the more memorable. Tako is CONTINUALLY wonderful. Always a new experience and always one that you'll remember."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and cocktails. Love the outside area, which looks like a food truck. It's anything but inside. We got a standing spot at the bar where it felt like we were eating high end street food."}
{"text":"Really cool place and friendly staff. Excellent margaritas. Just one word of note: this was our first time and weren't sure how big the tacos were. They're sizable! We ordered three kinds (2 per order, so six all together) to share between two people. We were STUFFED! Couldn't finish them. Didn't help that we had an appetizer. But everything was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really love the food here. It's a bit noisy inside but the outside tables were great. Loved the fish tacos and the guacamole. Loved the Elote."}
{"text":"I had the Pollo Asado tacos and two South American beers. The tacos were very flavorful and were good sized. Came in an order of two and that was enough food for me! The beer selection is very spread out, their selections are from all over the world and full of stuff you don't usually see, but they do have some regional favorites.  Overall, it was a good dining experience and I will go back. 4 stars rather than 5 because my first taco had a small bone in it, not a huge mistake by any means."}
{"text":"Make reservations to save some time waiting and definitely try one of their special tequila cocktails. Great for groups + date night although a bit pricey--worth every penny :)  +Street Corn -- Delicious  +Steak tacos are juicy with the right amount of heat +Spicy Cucumber drink very refreshing"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and setting! Margaritas are out of this world, and the wings in fish sauce are the best wings I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Food was good (not amazing, but really good), atmosphere is interesting, staff was...not entirely friendly, but not entirely unpleasant.  For Pittsburgh, this probably is the best taco you're going to find - give it a shot!  Location is convenient, though it is also very small, so finding a spot to sit can be challenging.  There were a few tables outside (filled) when I was there, but I would never sit there as you'd have to suck down the cigarette smoke spewing from every 3rd Pittsburgher's mouth.  Foot traffic literally walks between the restaurant and the tables.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were decent.  They have a lot going on and might be better to just focus on a few quality ingredients than seeing how many you can fit into one taco.  (Also, they omit from the menu some of the items on the tacos, so radish lovers rejoice and radish haters beware!)  I saw them making some of the other tacos while I waited and would probably order something different if I go back.  You're probably hard-pressed to find something similar in PIT, so go for it!  It's decent and the prices weren't too bad.    One bone to pick:  tacos come in orders of two, but they force you to order two of the same taco.  You should let people mix-and-match (and just charge the higher of the two prices).  That way if I get a taco I'm not thrilled about (like the fish taco), I don't have to eat two of them (I actually didn't finish my 2nd taco and was \"over it\" as I neared the end of the 2nd) and could try something else (that I might be more thrilled about and come back later for more)."}
{"text":"I once read that fusion food was just the bastardization of cultures on a plate. Regardless, I'm interested in novel approaches and can always go elsewhere in search of a classic. So, I'm Mexican-American and a brand new transplant from San Diego. This is the very first restaurant I tried to go to, as it was near my hotel and looked happening. Let me preface my review with: I got kicked out. Haha!   Anyway, the first night I wait over 30 minutes for a single seat to open, though there are free seats outside during my entire wait. I'm told if they only seat two people there, that I'm the only one-party and would be sat with them. A two-top is sat, the third stays empty until I leave at the half hour mark. I'm texted to return about 40 minutes later, but let them know I gave up. The second night in town I have a visitor meet me downtown and suggest we give it a try again. I explain the wait, so he suggests we take some \"road sodas\" to sip on while waiting.  Same open seats outside, though this time immediately sat! What luck. (That third seat was still free, BTW.) The hostess does a double take at the drinks in our hands, so we try to finish quick, though it's hard downing red. Anyway, we immediately order red wines, to let them know we're not trying to free load with the BYOB-wait-beverages. We also order Baja and al pastor tacos and ceviche. Everything was extremely too sweet for my liking. They candy the jalapeños and make it into a sweet jam spread with the Baja, the al pastor is like a sweet bbq glaze with fruit and the ceviche also has sweet fruit. Everything was fresh, just none of the heat and salty I look for in these dishes. Anyway, while eating, I finish my wine (my second drink of the night) and ask for another wine. I'm told that I have been cut off because I'm too drunk. Bwaaahahahaha!! Say whaaaa?!! I couldn't even wrap my head around that. I still can't, actually. The kicker is that they continue to serve my friend, who already had several drinks before meeting up with me, plus they served him two drinks there! But I have two wines with food and am told I'm crazy drunk. The server says she's not the only one who thinks I'm too drunk either, looking around. LOL, ok should we play 20 Questions to guess who else thinks I'm wasted? The awesome part is that before any of this transpires, I accidently engage the manager, not knowing who she is, because I liked a piece of jewelery she was wearing. After I'm basically told to leave, I pay, but cannot just walk away. I return to ask to speak to the manager. It's the necklace lady! Anyway, she was polite and couldn't really give an exact instance of me acting inebriated, even while I was talking to her about her necklace earlier. She did mention the wine we brought in at the start of the meal. I agreed that we shouldn't had done that, but they could have just told us we couldn't have our own beverages and not continue to serve the only drunk person in the party. She said they're trained to spot drunk people... kind of missed the mark in this instance, with their laser pointed drunk-o-meter.  Anyway... fusion cändi?d tacos ain't my bag anyway, baby. I'll be looking elsewhere to spend my $$."}
{"text":"Best Mexican spot in Pittsburgh!   I'm from California where the Mexican food puts all other spots to shame, BUT Tako!!!! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an amazing atmosphere, food, music, and service!"}
{"text":"The best, Jerry.  The best.   The octopus Tako and the pumpkin spice Margarita were amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner.  No resevation and sat at the outside counter facing the kitchen. Fun to watch the food being prepared. The artistry involved with the preparation and presentation is amazing. Their basic guacamole was fresh and had a nice little kick from Serrano peppers. Just the right amount. I had the maitake mushroom tacos. To say they were delicious wouldn't do them justice.  They were beyond with the flavor combinations. Had tres leches cake for dessert. Again perfect with a couple tangy creme fraiche (I think) quenelles that balanced the sweetness. I will definitely return when I come back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Probably my second favorite tacos in Pittsburgh, after Doce. This one is just a little more upscale. If you sit outside though, you're basically just sitting in the middle of a busy city sidewalk."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The pork in the pork belly tacos were the best I've had.  Very hip spot right in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love tako! Highly recommend getting reservations if you can, but I've also been seated outside without a reservation before. Inside the restaurant is octopus themed (tako means octopus in Japanese), very hip, and can be pretty loud. Honestly my description doesn't do the place justice!   They serve fusion tacos, appetizers, drinks, etc. I wouldn't go to this place expecting authentic tacos, but it definitely can be an amazing experience if you go in with an open mind. I don't even like octopus and the Tako taco tasted good to me! Another favorite is the Korean style one. Carnitas were good too, but I would recommend trying some of the more out-there tacos if you're here. In terms of appetizers I can recommend the papas bravas and the poke. The poke came with a lime foam which was definitely interesting (although I did find the amount of poke to be a little less than I would have expected for the price)! Drinks here are solid as well."}
{"text":"We walked in without an online reservation for seating and were given a 2.5 hour estimate wait time, but luckily, were told we could look for open seating at the bar and still get served food! So first off, as a warning to others, you probably should make an online reservation if you'd like to eat here at a table since this place is highly popular.   The service - Fantastic. All the waiters and waitresses seemed very informative and friendly.  The atmosphere - Great ambiance. Reminiscent of some bars in NYC with the dark lighting, booming music, and interesting decor.   The appetizer - Got the #3 guacamole order with smoked salmon. The taste was so light and fresh, and has a buttery consistency that melted in your mouth with each bite. When topped on their salted chip, it made a perfect complementary combination.    The food - Out of this world. You get 2 tacos per order which initially doesn't sound like much, but is actually incredibly filling. Their Chorizo tacos  ($12) are packed with meat, topped with a perfectly cooked, over-easy egg, and packed with flavor and spice. The Tako tacos ($16) though are an absolute must. You might think that octopus is not exactly the ideal meat for tacos, but it was far from chewy. In fact, you will never find an octopus grilled to tender perfection as the ones served here and deliciously cooked with a smokey taste."}
{"text":"When you get a taco here you must get the original with the octopus in the taco. There are other tacos are all OK but this one will blow your mind. The Korean taco was average and their mushroom taco is actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"I recently gave Tako 5 stars and a glowing review, but I am SO sad that I may not be able to return to Tako anytime soon. I have been there so many times and the food is AMAZING, but my friends and I had such a horrible experience last night. I really can't remember ever being treated so rudely.  We stopped in after Light Up Night to check out the late night menu. The hostess was wonderful and managed to find a table for the 6 of us rather quickly.  Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. Our server, Chelsea, seemed \"annoyed\" with us from the moment we sat down. It was 12:20am and she kept telling us that the kitchen wasn't quite ready yet, so we ordered drinks. We were confused, though, because the 2 tables on either side of us had already ordered.   When we finally did order, we ordered a ton of food for the 6 of us, so we asked for some small plates to share. Chelsea looked so annoyed that we had asked and replied \"I guess.\"  It just continued from there. I'm not sure what we did to annoy her, but every time we asked for something (extra napkins, more water), she would roll her eyes or have an angry look on her face. It was very uncomfortable for us.  The last straw was when we asked for a box to take the rest of our tacos home.  Chelsea got visibly angry and said \"we do not give boxes for the late night menu, you'll have to use one of the paper baskets that we served them in\" then she walked away. We were FLOORED! When she returned, we said we just wanted something to wrap the tacos in - even just a piece of foil. She replied \"typically, we do not give take out boxes for the late night menu because the cost of the items is so low, but I will see what I can do.\" The look of contempt on her face as she said this is what pushed me over the edge.  I worked as a server for 20 years of my life and I would have never treated customers so rudely.    It was then that we decided to talk to the manager, something I very rarely do. We explained the above situation and at first he was very kind. He told us that this was his first night on the late night shift and that he didn't want us to leave angry, so he offered us a gift card.  We told him we didn't want that, we just wanted him to know how rudely we had been treated.  He then started to make excuses for Chelsea, saying it had been a long night for everyone and that sometimes the transition from the regular menu to the late night menu is tough. This really disappointed us. I know it was a long night, but it was Chelsea's JOB to serve us and provide a pleasant experience for us, which she did NOT do. I'm sure that there are hundreds of people out there that would kill for her job and, in return, treat customers as they should be treated. It is sad, but true, that a server can make or break your experience and, unfortunately, Chelsea broke this one for us.   As I have said, the food is AMAZING and I have had so many great experiences there, so don't let this review keep you from going to Tako. You just may want to beware if you get Chelsea as your server."}
{"text":"Tako: 5 Stars Planted in the cultural district of Downtown Pittsburgh, Tako bills itself as a taco spot with so-cal and asian influences.  As I walked up to the restaurant, this place gave off the vibe that was going to be pretty great.  The kitchen is in the front of the restaurant and fully visible to on-lookers outside and customers inside.  Such a cool feature to see how the tacos were being prepared from start to finish.    Food/Drinks (2 Stars) Drink: Margarita ($10) Coincidentally, I happened to venture out to Tako on National Margarita Day.  So in honor of Margaritas (and Tequila), I opted to order The Classic Margarita.  Fantastic margarita made with corralejo blanco, bauchant orange liquor, lime, and agave nectar.  No complaints from me.    Starter:  Chips and Salsa (3 for $7) My weakness in life is Chips and Salsa, so when offer the opportunity to order Chips and pick 3 Salsas, I leaped at that opportunity.  I ordered Roasted Tomatillo, Peanut, and Smoked Chipotle.  By far, my favorite salsa was the Peanut Salsa.  I could not (and didn't) stop eating it. AMAZING.  The Roasted Tomatillo was delicious, but I was not a fan of the Smoked Chipotle.  Entree:  Tacos, of course  Upon the recommendation of the bartender, a colleague of mine and I order 3 sets of tacos (2 tacos per order), so we could each try one taco apiece. We ordered Al Pastor ($13), Korean ($16), and Bistec ($19). If I had to rank the tacos:  Bistec, Al Pastor, Korean.  The tacos were incredible!! Wow.  I'll brag about the Bistec and tell you what's in it (Only to entice you to order when you come).  The Bistec tacos include asada marinated flat iron steak, salsa borracha, smoked mushrooms, fried shishitos, and queso fresco.  Service (1 Star) We choose to sit at the bar, because it was impossible to get a table.  I didn't catch the name of our bartender, but she was great.  My margarita never hit empty, and she was pretty interesting to talk to which made for a fun night.    Cleanliness (1 Star) No complaints here.  This place was extremely clean.     Ambiance/Atmosphere (1 Star)  As I mentioned when describing Tako, the atmosphere was very cool with the kitchen being fully visible and at the front of the restaurant.    Would I recommend? 100% hell yes"}
{"text":"Great little joint!  Really good options for different styled of tacos and even some veggie options."}
{"text":"I love tacos and was very excited to finally try this place. My first impression was \"Wow. This place is super loud.\" It wasn't as much the crowd as it was the DJ. Yes, DJ. I didn't understand the purpose of a DJ at a taco restaurant but it sure made me want to leave quicker. Maybe that's? the goal...to turn tables faster.  My second impression came after the menus arrived. \"Wow. This place is EXPENSIVE.\" The various tacos averaged around $15. For two tacos. This limits your ability to try different tacos unless you are there with a group and share different orders. I went there anticipating a plate of 4 different tacos to try. Since that would have cost me north of $60, I ended up trying the Tako- a Korean BBQ taco which lead to my third impression.  \"Wow. THIS is what all the fuss is about?\" I've had Korean BBQ tacos before (that cost half as much) and these weren't even as good. They were tasty, but certainly not worth $15 for an order of two. All in all, I left a little hungry (remember that you only get two tacos per order), a little poorer, and a LOT disappointed. Their tacos all seemed to be creative combinations of flavors but for their mainstay taco--the one that carries their name--to taste like something I can make at home with a jar of marinade from Giant Eagle...definitely a little disappointing. I fear that this place is inflated because of hype and potentially because there aren't that many places to get good tacos in Pittsburgh.  If you are searching for tacos in PGH, I have to recommend Las Palmas in Brookline. The tacos are much better. Period. Buuuuuut it also helps that you can get seven of them for the same price as two at Tako and that there's no wait to eat and that your ears aren't ringing when you leave."}
{"text":"Terrific food! The fresh favors were expertly combined and well seasoned. The noted absence of salt and pepper on the table was fine because the seasoning was so perfect. Best guacamole in town. Great service! A little too loud for my liking, making conversation difficult, but the quality of food and service made the noise bearable."}
{"text":"I got the täk? taco and it was hands down the best cooked octopus I've ever had. It was delicious. I also got the avocado salsa. Also amazing. Highly recommend this place. It's a little pricey for tacos but delicious."}
{"text":"If you can find a time to go, do it. My favorite spot to sit is outside at the counter - it's mesmerizing to see the kitchen in action. I don't do spicy so my tacos are usually plain but still 100% delicious. The service has always been fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! We each got one order of tacos (2 of the same taco per order, about $12-18 depending on what you choose) and everyone really enjoyed what they got. I wish there was a mix & match option so I could have tried more because they all looked good!  My Al Pastor tacos with pork shoulder + pineapple were the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. We shared the street corn, which was so spicy and rich and amazing it was almost like mac & cheese somehow. We didn't try to customized guacamole this time, but the options looked delicious. They were super accommodating to a severe gluten allergy in our party, but they don't offer much for g/f drinks. (No ciders, just wine or cocktails.)  The atmosphere is very cool. It's dark and loud inside, with a live DJ, dimmed red chandeliers, and some very cool octopus art on the wall. The vibe here is awesome. If you're expecting a well-lit, quiet dining experience, look elsewhere. :) Service was extremely quick, but I'm not sure if that's the norm depending on how busy they are. Dress code is casual/trendy.  Overall great experience and plan to return ASAP! I'd recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"I came here as part of a work dinner with two other colleagues (none of us are from Pittsburgh). We love to eat, so we tried a good portion of the menu!  - Street corn: YES. Get this. It's hot, and just creamy enough. We finished every bite.  - Poke: Also an unexpected YES. It comes with fun rice crackers to eat. The poke was good, with interesting bits mixed in.  - Thrice cooked wings: I think these were good, but I honestly don't remember them. - DIY Guacamole: We got the variety that had crab and mango mixed in. I thought it was too weird to keep eating; my coworkers liked it, but it was the last item we finished between the three of us.  - Chorizo tacos: This was really great. The fried egg made it messy to eat, but overall, it was a solid, full taco. - Korean tacos: I liked this! I grew up eating Korean barbecue, and I thought they did a good job with adapting korean flavors in this taco. - Pig ear tacos: I think this was a special. I passed on this, but my coworkers loved it, and said it was the best pig ear dish they'd had.  We got another taco, but unfortunately I don't remember it!  We liked the Grapefruit & Sage margarita, and the frozen rum & banana float cocktail (which was a daily special).   Overall, I felt that tako had a unique, artistic vibe and great food. We ate outside, where we had a view of the sidewalk bar, and the cooks in the front making tacos."}
{"text":"Täk? is one of Pittsburgh's jewels hidden amongst the cultural district. Catering to a young, trendy crowd, the Asian-Mex twist restaurant seems to be more fitting of New York than the business district of Pittsburgh. Dimly lit and chattering with noise from its patrons and in-house DJ, it's clear to see that Täk? is definitely the place to be on a Saturday night. This little blip of New York flash works well in Pittsburgh. Lines of people weave out the door and down the sidewalk on particularly busy nights, so if you don't necessarily need a table, do yourself a favor and snag yourself a seat at the bar. The drinks are deliciously different and pair perfectly with the food. The tacos themselves come two to a plate and are perfect to share. While their tacos are rather light, I'd highly recommend ordering one of their appetizers to start. Täk? is an absolutely well-rounded dining experience, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the quality of this restaurant.  Extremely fresh ingredients.  Amazing combinations of flavors.  Superb service.  A+"}
{"text":"Vegetarian perspective   One liner- loud club like atmosphere with a few excellently executed vegetarian dishes paired with excellent service, skip the funnel cake  We've been waiting to eat here for awhile, reservations for prime time Friday and weekend need to be booked at least 2-3 weeks in advance.  We see immediately turned off by the extremely loud music/ they have an inhouse dj who had talent and spun some good tracks but it was too loud for me to enjoy the company I was with.  Cocktails were very enjoyable- my guava margarita was sweet but potent.   Apps/ entrees- some but not many options for veggies and probably near impossible for vegans since a lot involve cheese. We loved the street corn (perfect mild spicy with sweet corn and salty cheese) which was perfect to split between two people and wet your appetite. They had a beet appetizer option and a special entree that involved butternut squash - other than that there was only one veggie taco to choose from- which was sad but that one option- the mushroom tacos were very filling, the perfect flavor and texture combos and extremely enjoyable.  Dessert was a huge disappointment. We ordered the funnel cake which was bland, minimal powdered sugar and came with this caramelized apple sauce that did not make the dish any better. We took two bites and left the rest. Not worth the calories and probably the worst dessert I've had the past 6 months.  Service was impeccable and in many ways more than I expected for this type of atmosphere. Our waiter had a man bun and was attentive, always keeping our waters full, folding napkins, and whisking away dirty plates to keep the pace perfect. Was really impressed by the service.  Overall excellent tacos and cocktails but due to such disruptive music/volume we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We took on the taco big board for a table of four and for the most part were pretty satisfied. For the Big Board you pick any six pairs of tacos of the ten choices available. It really is a pretty decent bang for your buck even though at $75 if might not seem that way right away. We each got three tacos total and were able to try all six through split and share. We went with the Korean, the Duck Confit, the Al Pastor, the Carnitas, the Bistec and the Chorizo. All were pretty tasty, and the Chorizo stood out for me in particular. Feeling wealthy, I suppose, we also got the thrice cooked wings and the Queso Fundido. Both were delicious and quite possibly better than the tacos! The Queso Fundido comes with warm tortilla shells so it is definitely my recommended appetizer of choice if the actual tacos are seeming out of price range. Drink selection is amazing as well! Prepare to spend a pretty penny overall, but you will enjoy yourself. Service is pretty good and the atmosphere is perfect for a night out, or even a date night, not really romantic but the perfect combination of lively and chill. Would go again after saving up some money..."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos cool vibe, apps were a little over hyped.  But we will definately be back."}
{"text":"A great place to go if you want a very nice meal and you want to impress your lady/man.   My only recommendation is to dress nicely, they will scour at you if you don't look businessy or at least middle class.  The tacos are absolutely amazing- but they better be for that price.   The drinks -- eh-- pricey for me but I'm still young.   I really wish they would have some events or music to bring in a younger crowd because I love tacos."}
{"text":"Mmm the tacos here are really good and the restaurant has a fun atmosphere with all of the nautical decor. You can see the chefs making the tacos which is a nice touch. We got the octopus tacos and the Thai coconut margarita. We stopped by Täk? during a road trip, but if I lived nearby the Thai coconut margarita would no doubt turn me into an alcoholic. I have yet to find a coconut margarita that stands a chance against the one here."}
{"text":"When I ate the first bite of my tuna belly guacamole, my first thought was to write a yelp review. Holy guacamoley it was good. Never would you think tuna, nori and some other combo of japanese seasonings would go together with guac.  After that, we ordered one of their appetizer specials - shrimp ceviche, which was also a-mazing. In fact, because we were so enticed by our appetizers, my friend and I had even forgotten to order our entrees.   At this point, I was feeling a little full since I had some food beforehand. That spicy kimchi caramelized pork belly taco though. The moment my taste buds experienced this delectable substance (yes, substance because there must be crack in this), I knew there was no turning back. It's a shame it was only a special. Although the al pastor taco could not compare to the pork belly taco, it was still pretty good.   Drinkwise, I got Ramon's gin fizz, which is not bad for a creamer based drink (which I learned I don't seem to like) and my friend got the Hennessy Sidecar, which is a pretty solid cocktail.  This place is hands down my favorite restaurant at the moment. No pictures were taken this time (the lighting is ridiculously dark imo) but expect some when I go back to visit!"}
{"text":"We got there right before 5 and got a seat at the bar. Reservations were booked until 8:30 that night but we got in early to beat the crowd and sat at the bar. Food was amazing and drinks for, too. A little pricey but that's anywhere downtown. Atmosphere was really cool and service was nice."}
{"text":"So I'm Here in Pittsburgh for the week and decided to come downtown for a late night snack and drink with some co workers. We were going to some bourbon bar. Next door however... I see this funky dimly lit place playing notorious BIG and outside it says TAKO. Im intrigued instantly just by the music and the word Tako.. (I love tacos. For example if I was on death row and I could have one meal, it would be tacos.) so without hesitation or any permission from my co workers I just signal the \"hey we're going in here first\" face. Pretty packed but we manage a seat at the bar and we are just FLOORED by their tequila selection.   So this awesome bartender, Caito, makes us all these wonderful tequila based craft cocktails that we just absolutely loved! Then we order chips with a trio of salsas and Mexican corn to start. Both amazing!  We were so impressed and I was shocked there wasn't many yelp reviews so I asked Caito how long have they been open and she replies... \"Since Tuesday\" holy balls they just opened and I just happened to find it randomly?! I love random amazing finds!  SO THEN THE TAKOS. We tried just a few; The carnitas, the al pastor, chorizo, and fish. Favorite was carnitas and al pastor. Amazing flavors, well marinated meat cooked to perfection, and fresh made buttery soft tortillas. Chorizo taco was good and had a fried egg which was awesome but it was just a little overwhelming and I wasn't in the mood for breakfast. Fish taco was good could use a little more flavor but I'm also not a big fish fan.   I'm from California and I'm part Mexican and these were some of the best tacos I've ever had and in Pittsburgh. WTF. They were a little expensive but still very tasty. Very good quality and very good flavor. They come in orders of two and the price ranges from about $10-$14. We're probably coming back tonight or tomorrow. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends for galentine's day. Made the reservation weeks in advance and I'm glad I did because the place was busy, even on a Monday night! Staff was very kind. Our server, Chris, was great at helping us navigate the menu. We started with the Chef's Special Guac #5 with crab. It was great, and tasted very fresh. I had the Korean taco. It was delicious but a bit salty so keep a drink handy. Grapefruit and Sage margarita was great, and neither flavor overpowered the other. Don't skip dessert. Overall, we had a great time and will be returning!"}
{"text":"I liked this place overall as the food was good which is always important :-) When we walked in on a Wednesday, we were told there was a long wait despite empty tables. As soon as we mentioned we were going to Bakersfield, they ran after us to say a table had suddenly opened. That was a bit interesting, and I have heard others had the same experience. Are they trying to create the perception of popularity? Maybe. It was also super dark in there so I kind of lost track of what time it was. Intentional? Probably.   We ordered drinks and the guac. The guac was great and they brought extra chips when we ran out.   Ordered the Korean taco. Was good but also kind of salty. Tacos were a good size and pretty filling. Would be cool if you could mix and match the kinds. Overall I think worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of Pittsburgh's newest restaurants Täk? offers diners a dizzying array of tacos, margaritas and cocktails. Start with the chips and salsa along with a customized guac. If you've never had goat cheese and bacon guacamole you need to. The namesake taco with octopus is great but so are the Al Pastor with pineapple along with the chorizo. We ordered 5 different tacos and all were awesome. The cocktail and margarita menu is also comprehensive and creative. If mixed drinks aren't your thing you can grab a can of Tecate.   There is a live DJ and that may be the only drawback because it is loud as hell. That aside the atmosphere is like nothing else in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"What can I say? Best tacos in the city! I highly recommend the bistec and Tako tacos! Also they have by far the best wings in the city of Pittsburgh! Something about the sauce they use!  Must have reservations though! Always crowded"}
{"text":"I had put off writing this review each time Yelp suggests it, because I couldn't figure out how to approach it. So I'm just diving in. Tako is a place that I want to like more than I actually do. Don't get me wrong, I DO like Tako.. but I want to \"OMG WOW I WANT TO EAT HERE EVERYDAY\" love this place, because the menu is interesting and the setting is unique. I think it is because it's such a wildly unusual experience... it's not something I'm going to crave to eat everyday, though I am a fan.  I've been here a few times, twice for dinner and once for brunch/lunch on the weekend. The Friday night visit was my favorite, as they have a DJ and it sets the tone for a gritty, funky feel while you enjoy your dinner and drinks. The vibe I get is elevated street food. This is not your traditional Mexican food - these are complex dishes with a lot of layers which you'll get from the menu.  The guac is always a great option as you can customize to your liking by adding in various things including jalapenos and bacon. I've never been let down by the guac - it's a great thing to share with the table.  I've had a bunch of tacos off the menu, but if you're going as a group I really recommend getting the taco big board - you pick six pairs of tacos for $75. This is a pretty good deal as the tacos are pretty pricey. Again, these are \"gourmet\" tacos so the price is justifiable, but just keep that in mind if you're with a large group!  The margaritas and other drinks are DELICIOUS. They are also pretty pricey, but usually very strong (yay). Overall I do enjoy Tako. I especially like to take friends/guests who are in from out of town, as it's a very cool experience. However, I don't find myself going here frequently because I have a hard time spending this much money on tacos, fancy as they may be. As a taco minimalist, I tend to eat more traditional Mexican - but it's nice to treat yo self from time to time!"}
{"text":"I hate to be that dissenting person, but the only thing I got from täk? was incredible overpriced average food and short-term deafness.  I have wanted to try them for quite some time, being a taco lover, but after our lackluster experience I wouldn't recommend it.    We stopped in after the Pirate's defeated the Chicago cubs late on a Saturday night.  Even though it was late the place was still pretty busy.  There was a table available and we were seated.  Immediately I started to loathe the fact that I felt like I was stuck in a pretentious dance club so loud and full of strobe lights.  This is not my scene.   I can't hear my husband who is an arm's length away, as is the other patrons next to us as the table set-ups are very in line with their other restaurants meaning communal and crowded.        I decided on the duck confit tacos, and my husband chose the pollo tacos.  We each ordered one beer and waited.  The wait wasn't long but when you are incredible uncomfortable it seemed to drag on.  When our food came out I was pretty surprised that it came with no sides.  So $7.00 for a taco ($14.00 for two) that I ate in 3 bites.  I swapped my last taco with my husbands and enjoyed his more as I found the duck to be overly greasy and so, so, so, not worth the hefty price for a taco, especially with no sides.    We left, still hungry, a little deaf, and light almost $50.00 for four tacos and two beers.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but even so the atmosphere with the blaring DJ and the lights is not the ambiance I care to experience while dining.  Too many other great places around to waste my money and damage my hearing to come here again."}
{"text":"Make reservations or fight for bar seats. Has outdoor seating during the summer months. The indoor ambiance is amazing and I prefer it. This place is a bit on the expensive side for the simpler items but the octopus tacos and tequila selection are A++.   I make sure my friends have been here at least once."}
{"text":"My travels brought me back to hometown recently for business and hearing from very good friends about TAkO just had to try it and glad I did.  1. Service- was excellent from the owner Kevin to the waiter with recommendations and drink choices  2. Food- Extremely fresh and unique- had the chorizo TAkO which was awesome especially with the house made guac with pairings  3. Drinks- all fresh lime juice and pairing done right  Come here and bring people."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I went here with really high expectations. I had heard it was unbelievable.  My table started with chips and salsa. There were 3 salsas, two of which were wonderful. The third,  salsa DE arbol was supposed to be spicy, but it was bland and not spicy at all. I ordered the Korean taco. The meat was cooked perfectly but the Korean sauce was extremely salty. The peanuts added a nice crunch but overall, it was an average taco. Another diner ordered the Baja tacos. They were also nothing special as far as fish tacos go. The highlight was the potatoes bravas. They were really flavorful and crispy. Overall, I felt slightly let down. Maybe too high of expectations,  or maybe there are too many other quality places to grab tacos, so I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to grab a bite/drink downtown. It's hard to get seats though so I would recommend to book online!"}
{"text":"I can't even with Tako. I got the octopus, homemade guac, and we also shared wings. Everything, even the squid (which exceeded my expectations), was cooked to PERFECTION.  We went there for my husband's birthday and met this wonderful Italian couple from New York. (We had so much fun drinking and laughing with them, we ended up migrating to another bar.......I digress).   The guacamole was \"create your own\" and LOADED with bacon, per our request, which the men devoured. I could not get over the tenderness of the octopus that I ordered, and also could not have been happier with the service. We have tried to go back here several times for lunch, but discovered it's only open beginning early evening hours (maybe that's how they reel you in!). The wings were prepared perfectly, with just the right amount of sauce on them. Another perk was being able to look into the window as the shells were being prepared. Just such a cool place to sit down and eat a great meal and enjoy some awesome company. It's pretty small inside, so I'd definitely call ahead for a table. We would go back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"It's a bit overpriced but is still a great restaurant. The Octopus tacos where my favorite and they had a cocktail list that went on for days. I am fairly sure if you are at a club past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays there is a half off menu which is a great deal and so good after a night of drinks and partying. Check out this new and vibrant restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY.  I get to review this place after my first, long awaited visit!!!  Bobby and I always want to come in, but every time I call it's last minute and the only open reservations are at 10-11pm!  I guess that's a great problem to have as a restaurant!  So Bobby called three weeks in advance to make a reservation for a Tuesday night for my birthday dinner.  He took the 9 oclock reservation for last night.  We were seated right away by the host wearing a fabulous pair of printed leggings, fur poncho and big floppy hat!  The place was completely packed...about 8-10 tables plus bar seating on the first floor and another level of tables upstairs - all full.  Our server - didn't catch his name and no nametag - was really good.  Not overbearing or over the top friendly but not at all standoffish or rude.  He got to the point with explaining the menu and what is popular and made sure we were taken care of for the entire meal.  To start, we split the guac appetizer (#5, which we were told is most popular) with crab, pickled habaneros, pineapple and lime.  It was very good and didn't need any salt like sometimes guacamole does.  The chips were warm, crisp and fresh and they gave us more than enough. We decided to order 3 kinds of tacos to share - the Korean, Carnitas and Mushroom.  The Korean tacos were BY FAR the best.  The levels of flavor and the texture was absolutely perfect.  I honestly could have eaten 3 of those and been perfectly satisfied.  Mushroom tacos were my second favorite - really really good flavor for being vegetarian and had a good texture.  Carnitas fell short for me - they tasted how I expected but were a little too mushy for my liking.  I would try the fish tacos next time and I know Bobby will want the Chorizo.  As others mentioned, it is SO dark in there. Almost too dark to even see your food (or take a picture of the beautiful presentation without having an obnoxious flash).  It was also pretty loud, which I expected.  It was also really cold in there...but I don't blame public establishments for temperature flaws because of how insane the weather always is on a day-to-day basis..I'm sure it's hard to keep up.  The window from the outside and inside to see in the kitchen in the front of the restaurant was really cool and we stopped to watch the masters at work for a few minutes before we left.  You can tell they really take pride in their culinary craft and it shows in both presentation and flavor.  I told Bobby I will be calling this week to make 12 more reservations in advance (one per month) to make sure we get a seat at Tako to enjoy their food again :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the food here. This place has a cool vibe and the service is good. Great for meeting friends and hanging out but, the food is just okay. If you've had really good Mexican food this doesn't compare and doesn't meet LA standards. The ratings in this city are much more generous that other big cities so you maybe disappointed if you travel frequently."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Super cool, reservations are highly suggested and you are rather close to other tables so it can be hard to hear on the weekends but I still love it.   Drinks are amazing. The Grapefruit and Sage is my go to but also really liked the Thai Coconut and Pineapple Jalapeno Margs.   For the food: I love the Korean tacos, Bistec, and Tako tacos. Their homemade tortillas are the perfect vehicle for such delicious and fresh ingredients. Since they updated their menu, I am looking forward to going back and trying some of the newer ones. This is a must try spot for people visiting Pgh for sure."}
{"text":"A friend and I finally made it to Täk? and it did not disappoint.   Basically everything was amazing.  First off the grapefruit and sage margarita was waaaayy better than I expected.  I ended up having two.  The street corn was great but the papas bravas was outstanding.   I also tried the Loren tacos which also had a little kick to them but a good spicy. I don't think you could get anything bad here and I can't wait to return for more!"}
{"text":"Update: I've gone to täk? several times now (each one with a reservation) and it honestly gets better every time. My table is always ready exactly at the time of the reservation, the servers are consistently the right blend of quirky, efficient, and professional, and the food is still phenomenal. I've moved on to getting the chips and salsa every time, and I must say the green salsa is divine. You also get free refills of fresh, piping hot chips, a huge plus. I like the Korean tacos just as much as the Al Pastor variety, and the Chorizo ones would make great breakfast tacos as well. All in all I'm so glad täk? is a part of the Pittsburgh dining scene, and I can't wait for another dinner there. (I seriously just made another reservation.)"}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere, and awesome options!! They've got so many different options to please any person - shrimp, fish, beef, pork, chicken! Great atmosphere and casual environment. Fun drink specials (we went on Fat Tuesday so they were Mardi Gras themed!!) fresh guac that you can customize and add different stuff to (think: bacon, red peppers, crab!) definitely recommend it, but you should make a reservation because it was kind of busy!"}
{"text":"Tako Tako Tako...just writing a review for this place makes me want to go back! The place in general is super dark but it's a cool vibe. This place is always packed with people no matter what day of the week it is, and for good reason. All of their entrees are perfect, the platter they bring out when you order a decent amount of tacos is huge! I love when I look up and see it coming towards our table :) their tako taco is the best (yes you read that right) tako taco translated is octopus taco, you can NOT go wrong with this. Love date nights to this place. Their bar is also cool they have a lot of alcohol options and they make a mean margarita. And on a weird note: when you check out this place, go check out the lady's room. They have a very different bathroom lol when you go check it out you will know what I'm talking about :)"}
{"text":"Loved the food so yummy. Sat outside. Great service. Good drinks.cant wait to go back. Perfect night"}
{"text":"I have been dying to eat a Tako for over a year. I've seen nothing but good things on Yelp, food blogs, and social media. However, it didn't live up to the hype! I tried both the Korean and the Tako. The octopus on the Tako was cooked well, but I found it to be incredibly bland. The Korean was the better of the two, but it didn't wow me in the way I expected it to.   I did really enjoy the chips with various salsas. The chips were amazing and the salsas were flavorful. I also tried the Watermelon Basil margarita and that was absolutely delicious.   Final thoughts: if I were to come back it would simply be to grab a drink, as I don't think the food was worth the price."}
{"text":"We couldn't get a reservation so we had to sit outside but the food made up for it. The guacamole was great and we enjoyed the street corn as well. We tried the pork and Korean beef tacos which were well seasoned and delicious. My daughter had plain chicken and cheese which were also quite good. Service was attentive and friendly however our meal too over 50 minutes to arrive and for this they lose a point. How long does it take to make 6 tacos??  In my kitchen 10 minutes!  But if you've got the time, check it out and call well in advance to get s seat inside!"}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh for work and this place has been on my short list of restaurants to try.  Reservations are always booked solid, for the dinner hour.  I took a chance and dropped in and managed to get a seat at the bar.  The place was sufficiently full for a Tuesday evening.  I was given a menu in the form of a newspaper (pretty cool).  I bypassed the specialty margaritas for a standard margarita (sugar rim).  My margarita and a huge basket of warm tortilla chips and salsa arrived, while I waited for my order. The margarita was expertly prepared, strong and tasty!  I ordered the build-your-own guacamole and al pastor tacos.  The guacamole arrived really quickly, and I proceeded to dig in using the chips that had come with my salsa.  On a scale from 1-10, the guac was maybe a 6.5/7, needed a bit more salt, which I added.  It also had thinly slice jalapeno mixed in and was covered in shredded cilantro?  It's REALLY dark, so I can't confirm.  The guac just didn't do it for me, not at the hefty price tag of $11.  The portion was not that large, maybe enough to share with one other person, as long as you had another appetizer.  The price point should have been somewhere in the $6-7 range.  Also if you include additional add-in, the price ranged from $16-20, which I thought was a bit steep, but maybe it's just me.  A basket of plaintains or yuca chips would have been nice and maybe would have justified the price, a llittle bit.  A short time later the al pastor tacos arrived, nice portion, topped with pineapple ( I expected more of a char/caramelization), The tacos were really, really salty, almost inedibly salty.  I had to request water to chase the salty tacos.  The flavors were good except for the extra saltiness.  The tacos were 2/$12, so once again, not sure that the pricing was on point for what I received.  I do understand why other Yelpers like tako, so much; great concept, excellent food options, but just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was spectacular! My friend and I got the poke to share and mushroom and grilled octopus tacos. The poke was delicious! I was excited to try it. I was expecting traditional poke with rice but this had a lemony foam and guac at the bottom which was awesome! The mushroom taco had really good flavor but had too much aoli. The grilled octopus was really tender and probably my favorite. Our server Justen was super knowledgeable and friendly. Only downfall is the music is very loud and the table are extremely close together. I felt like I was shouting across the table to my friend! Despite this, the food was incredible and affordable! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So this past Saturday night, we were walking back from a game at PNC Park, the foot traffic along this stretch was heavy. Well what grabbed our attention first, was the outdoor counter seating. Then it was Tacos, in Pittsburgh. So we weighed the dining options and settled on here. Or so I thought. Went inside and it was packed, fine its Saturday night, that made sense. The weather wasn't the best outside, but that wasn't stopping the craving for tacos. So we said we'd eat outside and the hostess made it clear in a rather rude tone that ther was \"a list.\" That's great, how long is the wait was the next question, then rudely answered with \"there's a list for outside.\" I turned around walked out, I wasn't gonna express the first thought that came to mind. So I go out and see that seats had corned up. The other person with me came and said that they wouldn't even offer to put us down on this \"list.\"   So we stood there for a few minutes. It's odd, if this so called \"list\" existed, where was it's lucky winners for sitting outside in the crappy weather?   You can save your time on overpriced tacos. Street tacos shouldn't cost that much. And if you're not some trendy hipster who's not even trying, chances are you're getting a rude response from a hostess in need of an attitude adjustment. There are better options in that whole area."}
{"text":"Loved my carnitas and I had a excellent cocktail along with them. My husband ordered the Tako and the octopus in his first taco was chewy but his second was perfect. My main complaint was that the music was way too loud. I had to yell across the table to talk with our friends, but we would definitely enjoy the food here again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. The only problem is the price gets me every time. Not saying it's not worth it. But 2 drinks a piece plus guac and tacos puts the tab at an alarming number. Tako taco  is my favorite. Just love the way they cook their octopus. The duck is my second favorite and if you are looking for a meatless option get the mushroom taco cause it's extremely good. Their drinks are good but their food is way better. The ambience is awesome."}
{"text":"Holy wow. This place blew our minds (and I spent solid time in Texas). Excellent quality. Inventive flavors. And we sat at the street bar so we got to watch the chefs create all that magic."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos and margaritas I've had, and unique options. The 3 salsa sampler is a great appetizer. Loved the atmosphere here, although it was a little too dark. If you plan to check out Tako I would strongly recommend making a reservation a month in advance, they fill up quick. We were able to snag a seat at the bar since we got there shortly after they opened. By the time we left the place was packed and it was a 45min + wait. It's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Tako! We ordered the Big Board, in which you pick 6 pairs of tacos, to share amongst 4 people. While all the tacos were fabulous, I highly recommend the octopus. Drinks and dessert were equally fabulous. We made these reservations well in advance and the wait was definitely worth it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the Tako, Butcher, and Meat & Potatoes crew for staying true to their niche. Ambience and flavor in a trendy setting seems to be their calling here in Pittsburgh. With Tako they took a unique route and gave true meaning to \"yinzerita.\" Hailing from NYC and having spent tremendous time in countries where \"flavor\" serves to be life's impetus I can truly say my palette left a happy camper. The cobia ceviche was spot on - light and bright and bursting with cucumber flavor. The fish sauce was a phenomenal addition to the wings and it's this out-of-box thinking that gives foodies a job. In the midst of all the salsa dancing that took place on my tongue my liver, too, felt like dancing after a lychee & pepper x 2 (and maybe a grapefruit & sage) margarita. The latter was a bit herbal (maybe easier on the sage) but overall, fantastic drinks. Best margaritas I have had in town, period.   Now, for the proverbial filler. My favorite taco had to be the Chorizo followed by the Al Pastor and finally the Korean. A delicate and melt in your mouth shell filled with well cooked meats, seasoned and spiced appropriately. Perfect! I cared not for the grilled octopus nor the Baja (I tried others) - as, plain and simply, I've had better. Better meaning Mexico, California, and San Antonio themselves.  When you're being compared to the numero 23's of Mexican food world you know you did something right.  Not bad Tako, not bad.   Kudos  Highlights: Atmosphere, bold flavors, margaritas Pros: Above Cons: Easy on the herbs in the drinks (but this was just once), octopus and fish were a little chewy, but overall good flavors Recommend to a friend: Yes Recommend to family: Yes Would do well in a big city with a huge culinary following: Yes"}
{"text":"Remarkably excellent food and very good service. The inside is way too loud and noisy but I enjoy sitting outside and getting to watch the kitchen.  My kale salad was great, tangy, fresh and delicious. The carnitas tacos were perfectly prepared. I finished with the tapioca/mango/passion fruit sorbet that was wonderful.  Our hostess, Caroline, was smiling, good humored and kept this busy restaurant running smoothly.  Gourmet food. Fun decor. Creative menu. A winner!"}
{"text":"The decor is unusual, but in an enjoyable way. I really enjoyed the tentacle light fixtures. The music was good but incredibly loud, I wouldn't recommend this place if you plan on having an actual conversation (I'm an old woman, sue me). The drinks were slightly pricy but delicious, the lychee margarita was probably my favorite. The pineapple jalapeno margarita is not for the faint of heart, some serious spice in that one! The guacamole was tasty and exactly what i expect. It didn't exactly knock my socks off for 11$ and 1 cup serving size. Id recommend getting a different appetizer if you go. We tried three tacos: duck confit, carne asada, and carnitas. The carnitas was hands down easily the best one out of the three. I would eat the raw tomatillo salsa off a spoon it's that good. The other two were good but not amazing. The carne asada was actually sweet which doesn't really float my boat, but to each their own. Overall, this is a fun restaurant to try if you're into stretching your comfort zone. We might be back to try the \"tako\" sometime!"}
{"text":"The reason I gave this 4 stars was because I ordered takeout, this I was unable to comment on the service.   Overall, the food was incredible. Had the octopus tacos as well as the duck tacos. The octopus was definitely the star! It was so tender and flavorful. The duck was also great, but the real star was the octopus.   Will definitely visit again when I'm in Pittsburgh. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the shrimp and Korean tacos and they were so good. This place is absolutely amazing and very unique."}
{"text":"I've been dying to actually eat at this place since it opened, so I was pretty excited to finally come for dinner yesterday to celebrate some good food, good friends and another Mini of graduate school come to an end. I was not disappointed.  Let's start with the Food experience:   We came at prime dinner time with a party of 6. As the place is smaller, filled with two seaters, a lively bar, we were seated upstairs in one of their few booths. I love this. From the top, you get a view of the whole restaurants, where you can watch the people below dine, the food servers scrambling about caring the open faced tacos which sizzle and smell tantalizing. The menu is simple: One half is starters, starting with chips and salsa, and ending poke, chopped and papa bravas [variety ensembles of salads and small bites], the second half is filled with their signature tacos which are serve in sets of 2. On the back of the menu you find an array of signature cocktails made from their wall of tequilas and mezcal. [more on that later]. In addition, there is a daily specials menu highlighting some of their fresh ensembles of the day and a crazy \"build-your-own\" guacamole bar, which my friend J was ALL OVER.   We ordered the Chips and Salsa as well as the selection of guac that J crafted together as we waited for our drinks. My \"Sookie Stackhouse\", a frozen margarita style drink, garnished with a special set of wax poured FANGS. I enjoy the occasional gimmick like that. It was served with homemade tortilla chips and a generous heaping of cilantro on guac, which, btw, was creamy with some depth in flavor.  I did a split with a friend for the taco. I HAD to try the Tako Taco, for one, as it is the namesake taco, made with Tako's patron spirit animal [Octopus] as the star ingredient, as well as the Mushroom Taco, a veggie taco with Mushrooms and burnt brussels. Floored. By the nth degree, the Mushroom stole the show. A good balance of veggies, paired with oaxaca cheese and garlic aioli. Absolutely fantastic. While the Octopus was done really well, I was upset that it was slightly buried by the accompanying harissa aioli. I personally would have made it more lemony because I love lemony Tako, but as with everything, that's just personal preference. However, it granted me my additional delight of eating a Tako Taco and thereby referencing my favorite youtube video show MPGIS [in this case episode 41]. I chuckle... anyways, moving on.  Service was great with a decisive flow to it. Jacen is great, vivacious, and made sure that we were served with good speed and recommendations. Definitely a thrill. Impending service was equally executed. My reservation was completed online and so they called to remind me of my reservation both by email, as well as via phone call and we easily were guided to our seats upon arrival.   Now to my favorite parts of the restaurant:  First, the decor. The art around the room is fantastic. For its namesake, Tako, there is a huge Octopus covering the main wall. From the top floor, you look the beast square in the eye, from the lower level, it towers over the patrons, watching them devour tacos or simply waiting itself to devour the patrons, take your pick. On the top wall, you get a view of the last supper. Quite ominous.  Second, the garage style kitchen. Watch your tacos be made right from the sidewalk view or have them served to you street side . I'm totally interested how they are going to do this in the Winter time.   Third and final, the duality between the restaurants. With the same owners, Tako mirrors and compliments the space of butcher and the rye next door. From the linking walkway between the restaurants, to the opposite placements of the kitchens and the back-to-back bars, it creates split yet intermingled worlds, one in the depths of bourbon and rye, the other a world of tequilas and mezcal. In the end they are all drawn together under the watching eye of the Octopus.  The experience at Tako is solid, the food is complex and delectable, giving the patrons an opportunity to dive into a dark world for a couple of hours outside the real world. A solid 4.5 stars, which will only be topped once I sit at the bar, stare into the cooking fires making the remaining menu items I left untasted and hear the gentle shaking of ice in making another S. Warren cocktail, only the essence and standard I expect of a DeSchantz establishment."}
{"text":"Very simple cash only order procedure. Weather was nice enough to be seated outside. I decided to try the \"poke\". Order form gives you choices of base, protein, sauce, veggies and crunch. You pay in cash, tax is included, and receive tag with the number. Soon after the order is delivered to you. My \"poke\" combination was delicious. The meal size is appropriate and enough for the lunch. Wish that is served in wider dish. I had a hard time to keep my veggies in the container."}
{"text":"Tako!  Even the name is cool.  If you haven't yet, make an effort to try this place.  The outdoor bar seats right at the kitchen counter are absolutely the way to go, and well worth the wait to nab.    So, tacos.  I mean, they have other food...  But, tacos.  For gluten-sensitive peeps, they are more than willing to sub out a corn tortilla for flour if you request it/let them know you're gluten-free.  The only taco that's permanently gluten-y is the (breaded) fish taco.  Bummer, but so many other delicious choices, like the mushroom taco.  So yum.  Meaty, perfect, maitake shrooms with a garlic aioli, truffle huitlacoche salsa, and brussel sprout salad.  It makes my mouth so happy.    Also, the guac is really, really good.  It's fresh, and quality, and thick, and they do this thing where you choose your funky add-ins that make it even more awesome.  Don't be afraid to try that weird combo!  You know you wanna!    Aaand the gin fizz was pretty cool.  I loved the addition of avocado and rose water, and making it with Jarritos was a good choice as well."}
{"text":"Tacos.  Frozen drinks in a slurpee machine.  Chips and guac.  Reservations you can make on yelp.  Yes, please!  I came here and was instantly excited to try the interesting combinations of tacos available.  My friend and I split the Korean and the carnitas.  I was very impressed with the sauces on both - strong, but not overpowering - and really allowing the meat to stand on its own.  But let's not ignore the awesome taco shell.  Not too soft, and it didn't tear while eating which really pushes this place to the 5th star.    We also both got the frozen eggnog - which is not likely in season anymore, but it was incredible.  I would drink anything that came out of that slurpee machine.    Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time. Tried the Street Corn and Wings as the appetizers. The corn exceeded my high expectations. Shared the Al Pastor and Duck Confit tacos, which were great as well. Only thing I would have changed (and this is extreme knit picking) is the duck on the tacos was in big chunks, which made it hard to bite at times. I'm more of a beer guy than cocktails, but opted for the Grapefruit Sage Margarita and it was fantastic. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing little spot!!! My tacos were delicious as well as my Thai coconut drink!! I really enjoyed this spot. Definitely a place to visit while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love this place for Pittsburgh - it's different and fun - the people working here always seem to be having a great time too. Good vibes and great food. PS. Get the mexican corn on cob and make a ressie before you show up they are always packed!"}
{"text":"Overpriced tacos.  You can find much better and more authentic tacos in the city for a fraction of the price.  Don't be roped in because it's the hip place to go - find authenticity elsewhere."}
{"text":"In our opinion, tako doesn't live up to the hype. Prices for food and drink were high and not commensurate with the product. Very noisy & so dark, it's hard to read the menu. Someone asked a week later what we had for dinner & we really couldn't recall.  We did say the $9.00 potatoes were out of this world & truly memorable for a potato lover! Try Bakersfield tacos...now there's some flavor!"}
{"text":"Love love love their food! Ordered classic guacamole, street corn, and carnitas w/corn tortillas. Amazing!  Sat at the bar. Great service and hip vibe. Pittsburgh favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! The environment was dope and the music was on point! The spicy cucumber margarita was awesome and the chicken tacos were the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh. My friend's fish tacos were great too! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is my home away from home because I have so many relatives that live there and so I rarely get to explore the city and its many impressive eateries so I was PUMPED when I was in the Burgh' for work and my coworkers wanted to eat at tako. I have had my eye on tako for many months but its kinda hard to get into because its a popular hotspot for dinner/drinks. Myself and two coworkers were able to snag a 5:30 reservation and this has just become my favorite taco place ever. Let me start with atmosphere. This place is just plain cool. From the sidewalk there is a walkup taco window with a bar and some stools that opens in the summer for walk-up patrons. The giant wood front door is gorgeous and mysterious, setting the tone for the decor inside. The inside looks like a super hip underground taco-lair with graffiti, neon lights, and thumping music (only downside was it was a tad loud). The kitchen is surrounded by windows which I love because (as I've mentioned in other reviews) it shows patrons the kitchen has nothing to hide. Next - THE DRINKS. Myself and a coworker had a jalapeno-pineapple marg that was TO DIE FOR. My other coworker had a watermelon basil marg and it was equally as refreshing and delicious. Like load me up with those, throw me on a beach, supply never ending tacos, and I'm a happy gal. We started with fresh chips and guac and it was soooooo yummy that we killed the first bowl and ordered another! Then we decided we were ready to dive into tacos so we ordered a few different styles to share. Each taco order comes with two pretty decent sized tacos (as you continue reading please know we over-ordered on accident and 3 women did not devour 8 \"decent sized tacos\" but even if we did, that'd be amazing). We ordered carnitas, lamb, shrimp, and al pastor tacos and each one was mouth watering-ly amazing. These tacos were LOADED with filling - so much so I had to use a fork and knife to tackle them. Also lastly, our waitress was awesome. I was so so so stuffed and so satisfied leaving this place. I will absolutely be coming back every time I visit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"täk?. Easily the best food experience I had while visiting Pittsburgh. When I saw the stellar reviews on Yelp, I immediately went to make reservations - only to find that there was nothing available until 10:30PM on both Friday and Saturday nights! Luckily, I was getting into the city late that Friday evening and could make the 10:30PM reservation work. I can only imagine what the wait is like without any!   When we arrived, the place had pretty much cleared out from the dinner rush. The outdoor bar area (where you can watch them make the tacos) was still full, but inside contained a few parties lingering from dinner over drinks or new couples being sat. We were given a table on the first floor and we settled down to order.  Starting with the trio of salsa + chips and the \"build your own\" guacamole, my boyfriend and I were in food heaven. The salsas all had a good mixture of spices and temperature, and the guacamole was the freshest it could be! It paired well with the salty chips and fruity margaritas we ordered.  For dinner, we both ordered a pair of tacos (the Chicken and Al Pastor) and they were AMAZING. The Al Pastor was marinated to perfection and I loved the grilled pineapple they put on top. Furthermore, their tortillas were on point - using a flour and lard mixture to make their own. They were light but still held the taco ingredients together well.   While dining at täk? was a great experience - one I will definitely want to have again - I was let down by the prices and chips. The chips seemed to taste similar to what you could pick up at a grocery store, and with all the great, fresh food served there, I feel like their chip recipe (if homemade) could be better. Finally, the price - it just seemed a little high for the area and food täk? serves. We ended up paying close to $100 for four drinks, two pairs of tacos, and two appetizers."}
{"text":"Slightly overrated.  The Korean beef taco is amazing, but everything else I've tried wasn't as good.  Cocktails are really good."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, this was just not good. We went on a Sunday evening, so maybe the A team wasn't there, maybe they all got food poisoning, maybe the oscars distracted everyone...but boy was I disappointed. The prices don't bother me, the atmosphere doesn't bother me, having to plan ahead doesn't bother me. But bad food REALLY bothers me. The bisteca taco was so fatty that I had to decide if I wanted to swallow giant chunks of meat while I privately panicked that I was going to choke or just spit the blobs of gristle out. The tako taco consisted of thick giant rubbery tentacles that had a terrible fish odor as I brought the food to my mouth. To the point that my hand involuntarily stopped moving in a last ditch effort to save me. I took a bite anyway. Shouldn't have. Everything is covered in cream sauces and wilted cabbage. Chips were ok. Korean taco was ok. Not ok enough to ever go back. Go to las Palmas or Bakersfield. Or take someone you're mad to tako and slap them with that rubbery ass tentacle."}
{"text":"Even though you are paying a pretty penny for a taco it is well worth it.  The wide range of tacos means there is something on the menu for everyone, along with their wide range of tacos is their list of drinks.  The margaritas are outstanding along with a few of their other cocktails I have tried. Overall I was a big fan of everything it had to offer and loved the vibe they presented with the style of decor.  Would reccomeend to anyone looking for a night out downtown."}
{"text":"Täk? is a restaurant that I had on my bookmark for a while in the Pittsburgh area. I was super excited to have gotten reservations for it, and experience what Täk? was all about! I will say Täk? served me one of the best Mojito I've ever had, while the appetizers of the salsa and chips were quite amazing! I tried four salsa and chips, each salsa had a different flavor/spice entirely. I tried the pork, chicken and steak tacos! My only advice is to avoid the chorizo, it was a weird combination of sweet and savory that didn't tickle my fancy!"}
{"text":"We came early on a Friday night and were surprised to find a 1 hour wait. The hostess offered to text us when the table was ready which allowed us to walk down along the riverside and enjoy the Pittsburgh views. We arrive back just in time for our indoors table.  We made sure to spend some time looking thru the glass windows into the kitchen on our way into the dining room. The vibe was super hip and alive. The DJ was throwing down some very good tracks. We ordered our custom made guacamole, feta cheese, tuna belly and tomatoes. It was not only unique but a truly amazing combo of flavors. Next up street corn, Tako tacos, and Korean tacos. Absolutely delicous! Full of rich bold umami!! Unfortunately we didn't leave room for dessert but next time in Pitt we will be back to check some out."}
{"text":"Tako made my day! We visited for the first time after a Pitt football game and were so excited by the options. We had the customized guac (great options for add-ins) and then shared both the chorizo and the pulled pork tacos. Both were great, but I went back for the pork! The meat was done very well.. plenty of flavor!  I've since been back to share the awesomeness with my family and again everyone left pleased! They get quiet busy, but the online reservation system made it very easy to book a table for after a cultural trust show!  I'd also suggest trying to get there right as they open on a beautiful PGH day, we sat outside at the bar on the sidewalk and it was fun to watch the kitchen prep the food and feel like you could still have a conversation!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a cool place to have dinner with some friends and decided to try this place out.  Thinking that a Wednesday night would be easy to get a table, we didn't make reservations.  We were wrong - the place was packed.  Since the place looked cool, and was obviously jumping, We put our names in and had drinks next door.  We were glad we waited. We started with a tuna app, fried chicken tacos, and the queso fundido (with short ribs).  That queso was out of this world!  We also had a round of mango chile margaritas - a little zippy (which I love) and absolutely delicious! We then shared the Shishito, shrimp, Korean, and duck tacos.  All delicious!  The shishito was my favorite but I think I was just overloaded by goodness by the time I had a chance to try them all.  The Korean and duck tacos were very rich.   Overall, we enjoyed our visit and would come back again!"}
{"text":"Very, very satisfied. Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I thought the two best tacos were the fish one (baja) and the strip steak (bisteca) . Delicious"}
{"text":"Several people recommended this place to me and now I'm recommending it to so many others. This place is AWESOME. My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and have tried the chorizo, mushroom, Korean, and tako (octopus) taco. It's all sooo good. The drink menu is also quite good. I had the El Diablo cocktail (ginger beer, lime, and cassis) and it was refreshing and delicious. My only complaint was that the drink took a really long time to get. I had basically finished all my food and then the server brought over my drink.   Anyways, they're pretty much booked all the time, so if you're hoping to make a reservation, I'd recommend doing that a few weeks in advance for a \"normal\" dinner hour. I was looking about two weeks in advance and only saw reservations for times like 10pm, which may be a normal dinner hour for some, but a bit too late for me. We ended up just going around 6pm and putting our names on the list. They said it would be about an hour, so we went down the street to another place to hang out. They texted me saying they had a table for us in about 45 minutes, so I'd say that wasn't so bad. One of the times we sat at the counter by their open kitchen and it was so fun watching them make the tacos. I kept enthusiastically saying how good the tacos were, so I hope I wasn't annoying them too much. I couldn't help it, they were really that amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe and great food! We had the street corn, chips/salsa, pollo taco and al pastor taco. While it was all delicious, the pollo taco and street corn were our favorites."}
{"text":"Was in town for a RHCP concert asked some locals on places to go. Under advisement ended up making reservations at tako.  It was just okay did not really hold up to all the hype. Waiter was really anxious to end his night and it showed.   Food was average they're tacos I mean really?  I'm sure there would have been many better options in Pitt. Loved the city though first time there."}
{"text":"We had to wait for weeks to dine at Tako but it was totally worth it! Every single dish was delicious. We had Poke (tuna) as a starter and three taco dishes: pork belly (from the special menu), tako (octopus), and duck confit - pictures left to right. Duck confit was our favorite - reminds me of Peking duck. Absolutely amazing! Can't wait to go back and try the other tacos!!"}
{"text":"This is a hip cool trendy place that makes Mexican / American fusion food.  It was Friday with no reservations so I had to wait an hour for a table. They have a small interior and an outdoor street bar and sidewalk tables. Make reservations on the weekend!  I sat at the bar outside which is attached to the kitchen. I got to watch the cooks making everyone's food and got to chat with passers by telling me they liked what I ordered.   I got the tangy yummy street corn. I got the strawberry lemonade Margarita as I was hot. I got the AL Pastor pork shoulder with pineapple tacos which were good. I have a sweet tooth so I would have wanted maybe one more piece of pineapple on mine. I was still hungry and didn't want to go so I tried the churro desert which was homemade cinnamon churros, with berries and coconut sorbet with Carmel suace. This was a light refreshing dessert, not overly heavy.  This was a cool fun place to eat. My service was a little slow because they were getting slammed but I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim with a couple of friends, and although we didn't have a reservation made 4 months in advance, they were able to squeeze us in on the sidewalk tables.  So, I can't speak to the décor and atmosphere of the restaurant so much as I can say that it's fun watching the crew make tortillas and tacos in the fishtank kitchen area they have going on.  I ordered the mushroom tacos because I had eaten a large snack before I went out (not knowing if food was going to be involved for the evening), and wasn't hungry for my usual standard starter of carnitas tacos when trying out a new taco joint.  I must say, I was pretty blown away by those mushrooms.  Don't let their veggie status fool you--they are pretty substantial.  And tasty.  One friend got another type of taco and though I can't remember which one she got, I do remember her liking it.  My other friend ordered ceviche, and the chips that came with it were self-replenishing, I swear.  We all three were picking at those, and there always seemed to be more!  The one thing I really wasn't super impressed with were the cocktails.  The first one I ordered was advertised as being \"stupid spicy\", and I tasted more mix than anything.  Spice level = 0, which is what I affectionately call \"Pittsburgh spicy\".  The second cocktail was better, but not particularly memorable.  I would definitely re-visit this place with a proper res, if for no other reason than that I'm a fan of this restaurant group and a sucker for tacos."}
{"text":"I went back and forth a bit on whether to give tako a 4- or 5-star review; I wish there was a 4.5-star option! I made a reservation about a month in advance, which I read was recommended from others who have also left tips/reviews for tako. Our party increased upon arrival and I wasn't able to give advance notice to the restaurant. They did a great job giving us options to get us seated more quickly, or to have a more comfortable place to enjoy our evening. We opted to wait an extra 30 minutes or so past our reservation time for one of the tables upstairs, and I appreciated that the host and hostess were constantly updating us on the status of our wait. Our waiter provided great service throughout the evening as well. He was personable, willing to give recommendations, and put up with our indecision and need to have a few more minutes to continue perusing the menu.  Now for the food... the most important part, right?! The tacos were yummy. There are several types of meat or vegetarian options to choose from, and there are also non-taco items that you can order. Why do that when they are known for their tacos? Here is why I couldn't decide between a 4- or 5-star review. You can't mix or match. Each plate comes with a couple of tacos, but both tacos are the same. What would be awesome is if you could section off the menu so that you can order two or three tacos on a plate and have each one be different. I really wanted to try a couple of different tacos, but at $12 or more a plate, that wasn't an option. There was one \"party\" option that allowed you to order five different tacos (if I remember correctly) and you receive two of each. This is great if you have a group of people who want to split the options. Just wish there was a smaller version of this option available when you can only really eat 2 or 3 tacos in a sitting.  Other than that one thing, tako was great. I think it lives up to the hype. I haven't had the opportunity to find decent Mexican or Tex-Mex style food in and around Pittsburgh. Out of what I have had the opportunity to try, this one is the superior option. It is a really great date night spot as well, or a great place to snag a reservation before going to see a show at a local theater. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Foods super good. Service kinda sucks.. they seem to not care you're there or in their presence. Maybe I'm just high maintenance since I work at a super nice high end bar but when I sit down at the bar and three bartenders look at me and then the other way..  Automatic sour taste in my mouth. I have to be super nice and kiss ass of my guests so you should too. Be friendly people! You guys have a killer gig, make the best of it."}
{"text":"Have been there twice now and there's no doubt the tacos and drinks are great.  I'm not sure if they are worth $7-9 each but you are downtown after all.  Two themes I have picked up on from both visits. 1: each of the waitstaff we encountered were not that friendly.  On my last visit I ordered my tacos minus one item and someone else at the table ordered the same type.  When the server brought them up, he failed to mention which one was missing the item and I ended up finding out after a single bite.  The server was not quick to remake them, telling me \"you should have told him that you ordered yours without\".   They did make new ones but in 30 years, I've never been told that it was my fault the server didn't communicate to the food runner.  Theme 2: they never ask if you want more drinks.  Not sure why but both times we had to ask for another round.  At $10 each, with 4 of us in our party wouldn't it make sense to try for another $8 in tip? Especially if it's before the main food arrives.  Volume volume volume seems to be the gameplan, given the size of the venue. Suggest you Try it a few times and then wait for someone to open up a bigger place with a nicer staff and lower prices.  Only a matter of time."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back here again. I love tacos, so this place was obviously a must. I was really impressed with mine (mushroom), as were my friends (traditional chicken and a specialty duck taco). We weren't expecting a ton of food, and we felt that the price was fair for the taste and service. Also - amazing pina coladas, so strong!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and staff are great! Also great food and drinks! We did have to up the spice level on everything."}
{"text":"What a great find! I am from the Southwest and I take my tacos very seriously, so I will admit I was skeptical, but I left feeling very impressed. I'll start with the disappointments. The white sangria was incredibly sweet, fake-tasting, and had no discernible booze in it. My other complaint: large chunks of canned pineapple in the Al pastor, bummer. But the highlights far outweighed my disappointments. After I finished my sangria I ordered a Spicy Cucumber marg which was wonderful, well-presented and sublimely spicy! I like the build-your-own-guac concept a lot. My boyfriend is a quac newbie so we got the classic but substituting fried onions for fresh and added shishito peppers. Absolutely fantastic! We ordered the street corn, which came off-the cob (cue skepticism) but was really, really delicious. It was like if Elote was Mac n cheese. Good stuff. Pineapple aside, the Al pastor was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. So were the Carnitas. In my opinion, all-around a great job of high end tacos which retained a good bit of authenticity. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tako is amazing. Getting a reservation is nearly impossible though, so plan early.  The poke was interesting. I liked it. The whipped lime was a really good touch. The papa bravas were also really good.  All of the tacos are great, but the Tako taco and the Baja were my favorites. But really, every single taco was amazing."}
{"text":"Great food. Cool atmosphere. Build your own guac was great. Tacos were amazing. Our server, although I forget her name and it's a shame cause I'd love to give her a shout out, was phenomenal. I will definitely be going back. The al pastor were some of the best I've had.  My only knock on the place is that you can't \"mix\" your taco order. 2 tacos per order but you have to get the same ones. Id be willing to pay a bit more to order them a la carte in order to try different kind."}
{"text":"This was the second time we were at Tako, and both experiences were tremendous.  We start with chips and fresh guacamole which is awesome.  The drinks are to die for!  I have had the passion fruit margarita and it was fabulous, and the house margarita is definitely the best in town.  We have add a few different types of \"takos\" all of them have been fresh and full of flavor.  The atmosphere and decor is really hip and cool.  Make a reservation, because usually it is packed and the bar seats less than 12."}
{"text":"OMG, I regret waiting so long to go there because I feel like it's days I've missed that I could have been eating there!!   I've proclaimed it as one of the top 3 meals I've had this year!    We started with the corn and wings and I had the duck tacos for my main course. It's going to be hard not to repeat this EXACT meal every time I go back because it was SO good.   I haven't even mentioned the decor and atmosphere, it's not like nothing else in Pittsburgh and I really think it sets a new standard. I just hope others can keep up. :)"}
{"text":"Tried the special taco of the month, it was some kind of pulled pork with peanut sauce tacos, unmistakably fresh, authentic ingredients, and totally unique twist on a traditional taco, with the Asian inspiration. Also had several salsas as appetizers, and each different style really blew my hair back. Atmosphere pairs perfectly with food, unique and fresh, but not the least bit pretentious or overly fancy. If your looking for fresh, from scratch creations, this is a must try! I would try any and every item on menu. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! It's officially our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Damien, our server was excellent! Very informative and friendly. The ambience is great! They had a DJ on the Friday night that we were there, and it felt like that place should've been turned into a fancy club after dinner hours! It is a bit loud for conversations, but we didn't mind that!  The tako tacos are a must try - I've never had octopus so tender before, and the combination of flavors was just divine! We also had the Korean and Baja tacos. Both excellent - impressive combinations of flavors. One thing to note - the wagyu on the Korean tacos are deep fried. It was excellent, but I would like to try something grilled in the future as the Baja fish was also deep fried.   We ordered the Korean buns to start, but this did not agree with our tastes. Stick with the tacos and you'll have an amazing dinner.  The cocktails are amazingly crafted, well worth the $10 price for quality. We had the frozen pumpkin margarita and spicy passion fruit margarita, both excellent!!  I have already made my next reservation seeing as they're booked a month in advance, but I cannot wait to go back for more tacos!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Queso fundido. Margaritas and Sangria. Tacos, specifically chicken and steak. Quacamole. Service. Ambiance. Everything about this restaurant was amazing. Actually got a same day reservation for 7 pm on a Tuesday -- beyond lucky!! Will be coming back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend and some of his family before the pirates game. Dinner service starts at 5:00 and make a reservation it's a small spot. I ordered the shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos which had: fried rock shrimp, spicy mayo, avocado, & cabbage salad. The five shrimp were perfectly cooked and everything in the taco worked really well together. The tacos come two per order. My friend and his family got the special of soft shell crab tacos which I tried and that was very good reminded me a little bit of Maryland. And also the chicken tacos were great as well. This place is very good I will be back for sure. Our waiter also provided excellent service, knew the ingredients and specials well, recommended items, and he helped us make decisions."}
{"text":"I've been curious about tako for awhile and finally decided to make a reservation for my Dad's birthday. I didn't understand how a restaurant could be booked so many weeks in advance. If you want a Friday or Saturday night reservation before 9 PM, you need to book more than a month in advance. Luckily I was booking for a weeknight so I didn't have much trouble, even though I still booked it about a month ahead of time. When we arrived, I realized the restaurant is pretty small. So it made a little more sense why they booked up so easily. We decided to order a taco board for $75 where we got 12 tacos (6 pairs). One strange thing was that we weren't allowed to order more than one pair of any style taco. We tried to order four fish, and they wouldn't allow it and said we had to pick 6 different styles and couldn't have duplicates. Luckily they all sounded delicious so we easily picked another type. The atmosphere in here is really dark, but not so dark that you can't see all of the attention to detail they put into the aesthetic. We got a queso appetizer. It was the best queso I've ever had. It was sooo delicious! Even better than Bakersfield, which was my previous favorite. The weird thing though was that they served it with maybe 6 small pieces of pita instead of chips. The four of us blew through the pita and were left with all of this cheese and nothing to dip in it. It was kind of depressing. Luckily our waiter brought us some chips, but I don't understand why the chips don't come with it, or at least more pitas. The cheese - pita ratio was way off! When our tacos arrived, they were literally brought out on a giant board that took up most of our table. Every single taco we tried was just as delicious or more delicious than the last. They were all generous with meat and toppings and super filling. We can't wait to come back and definitely recommend the board as a great way to eat with a group and get to try a variety of tacos."}
{"text":"Food was great, as usual, tequila was amazing, and we were seated by the owner. Great service."}
{"text":"They have the best shrimp tacos you will ever eat in your entire life. The restaurant is chic and has a very unique aesthetic. One bad thing, however, is that the guacamole is bland and overpriced ($14 for a small bowl). If it weren't for that, I would give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"tako.  Very very tasty...if you like the taste of a splinter in your daughter's finger from unfinished wood at the table.  If you like the taste of not one of the staff asking what they can do to help fix the situation.  Customer service should come first.  We left the restaurant with a thorn embedded in a crying 6 year old's finger...and looking forward to a long night ahead.  (The food is actually really tasty so hated writing this review)"}
{"text":"Great tacos, desserts, and drinks! The tacos aren't cheap but are a good amount of food for a meal, especially if you split chips and salsa or something (also super recommended). I haven't tried all of the tacos yet, but so far the chorizo, pollo asado, and al pastor have been wonderful experiences :) Meat is always perfectly cooked and the taco ingredients are super creative. We also had this super awesome cheesecake dessert that was an amazing light whipped cheesecake with berries and berry drizzle. Delicious. For the drinks, you also can't go too wrong with any of them - the grapefruit sage is solid and packs a pretty strong tipsy punch. They also have an frozen eggnog cocktail that's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I literally love this place.  Best tacos in the city hands down and excellent service to boot."}
{"text":"We made a reservation, but were able to be seated 15 minutes earlier anyhow (awesome).  The service was stellar, and our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  We shared a classic guacamole, which was tasty and came with fresh / warm tortilla chips. I ordered a spicy floral cocktail whose name evades me, but it was delicious (maybe passion fruit).  I got the al pastor tacos for myself. Also fantastic, and way more filling than I expected. I gave the rest to my spouse to finish. He had the tako, which is octopus, I'm not about that life, but he said he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Please be advised that this restaurant does not offer handicapped accessible seating. They only offer tables too high for a wheelchair with stools that people with mobility issues would have a hard time climbing on.   The only alternatives are to sit at the slightly lower bar,  eat outdoors if available,  or sit next door at Butcher and the Rye. I was extremely disappointed by this (I'm not even sure if it is legal) and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We weren't sure what to make of this place but decided to give it s try. We went on a Tuesday night around 7:30. It was packed, but we got seated right away.   They had a nice selection of drinks and tacos   Everything was very good - including, surprisingly, our service. It's sad, but you run into so many service lapses these days that when you get good service, you're surprised.   Exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"I was here at 4.55pm on Monday and there was already a bit of a crowd outside waiting for the doors to open at 5! Now that's a sign! And sure enough, Täk? doesn't disappoint! In fact, I'm back again on Wednesday to try the other items on their menu that I didn't get to on Monday! This \"getting full\" thing is annoying. If only I was a bottomless pit.. I'd pretty much move in above Täk?! Their bartenders really know how to mix great cocktails. I'd recommend the pineapple-jalapeño margarita and the spicy cucumber if you like a spicy kick to your drink like I do. The mushroom tacos are the BEST ever! We also enjoyed the mushroom queso and butternut squash tostadas. Service is super fast and efficient. I like sitting at the bar here but if you absolutely need a table, reservations are strongly recommended..even on a weekday. This place is always packed! No wonder they don't do happy hour specials! They don't need do. But considering the upscale vibe that this place has, and their prices, I feel they needn't charge $1 to refill tortillas that come with the $12 Queso! That's my one peeve.. Don't get cheap on the tortillas, täk?.. come on now! Be above that!"}
{"text":"Great hip cool place in downtown. The margaritas were soooo good. Our group sampled several and all of them were imaginative and delicious. We loaded up on appetizers - street corn - potatas bravas - and several others I can't recall after all of those margaritas. Tacos were all delicious as well - particularly the octopus and Korean taco.  Highly recommend if you can get a reservation."}
{"text":"Yelp is the reason I elected to go to Tako and I'm glad I went but overall, it is WAY over-hyped.  First of all, many reviews said you had to make a reservation well in advance and they were right so I made mine a month ahead of my visit to Pittsburgh.  When I went to make the reservation, the only time slots they had for Friday night for two were 5pm and 10:00pm.  I went with the 5pm and when we got there at 5, we were the ONLY ones there.  And in the hour that we sat there, the restaurant only seated a few other tables.  It was mostly empty the entire time which was odd since the reservations are so \"highly sought after.\"  The actual space is super cool.  The entrance looks a little \"speakeasy-ish\" which is all the rage these days in places like New York City and Chicago so I think that's what they were going for here.  I loved the octopus handles on the door and the interior was super cool.  It is very dark in there which provides a romantic atmosphere.  The hot pink chandeliers are lovely.  Great interior!  The service was fine.  Our waitress was nice and we didn't have to wait long for anything which was great.  The food was just ho-hum for the price.  I can't believe how much we paid for what we got!  It was outrageous.  We started out with Margaritas.  My fiance got the frozen blackberry margarita and I got a regular watermelon basil one.  In hindsight, I wish I had gone frozen as well seeing as my margarita was almost entirely ice.  It was tasty but it only lasted a couple of seconds.  Not worth the cost!  I ordered a poke bowl and I guess I am super spoiled because I live in a town where Poke restaurants are popping up everywhere.  This poke bowl was so small and not filling at all.  I would not recommend it, whatsoever.  If you want poke, just get in the car and head to Columbus and check out Hai Poke or Poke Brothers.  They know what's up.  I also ordered a plate of the steak tacos and they were good but WAY too salty.  And so small for the price.  I was just astounded by the quality of the food versus the cost.    We spent $78 for four small tacos, two margaritas (one that was mostly ice), and a small poke bowl.  We didn't get any chips or anything like that.  Just not worth it.  If you're only in town for a short time like we are, don't waste your time here - go to Gaucho's!!!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were absolutely delicious! Service was good and prompt. The decorations were cool but the tables were so close together it was almost impossible to have a conversation. We decided not to stay for an additional drink because we couldn't talk."}
{"text":"Maybe it's me but the tacos here are way over priced, maybe it's the downtown real estate payments but, they aren't worth what I paid for them."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Both time i dined at Tako i sat at the outside bar and service was great, food excellent and drinks amazing! Prices are very reasonable, two taco's for $12-$14. I would suggest you cehck this place out while in town. Its small and very busy so get there before the dinner rush or after."}
{"text":"My husband and I made our own guac, which was literally the best guac we've ever had. I had the Korean tacos which I can HIGHLY recommend. Service was also great!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite restaurant in this city. Service was exceptional as usual. I also got to sit outside in December and enjoy my meal. They are always dog friendly when you can sit outside and I had my Great Dane with me this day."}
{"text":"The portions are very small for the price. We left hungry. Have you ever been to a restaurant and left hungry after ordering a meal? I hadn't until we tried Tako.   The food tasted good, but that doesn't make up for actually being hungry after leaving a restaurant, which you'd think is unheard of."}
{"text":"The food is good but definitively overpriced. If you compare with a place such as smoke, the tako are about 50% more expensive for the same quality (in my opinion). The place itself is very noisy and this is almost impossible to really discuss. The service pressures you to order, which is very inconvenient when you want to take your time. Finally, the drinks prices are ok but the size of some is totally ridiculous ...  So, yep, the food is good but when going there, I was feeling I am paying the price for the hype, not for the food ..."}
{"text":"Come here if only to have the tapioca for desert!!!!  I had the taco tacos and they were perfect. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys tequila."}
{"text":"Having heard only about the octopus tacos, I was a bit hesitant about the menu, but we fell totally in love with everything about the restaurant, the menu and the drinks.  Guacamole was so fresh and perfectly flavored, trio of salsa also delicious, but the habanero margaritas and the pork shoulder tacos were outstanding. With just the perfect hint of spice and sweet--we eat every bite!!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"In a big visit to Pittsburgh, tako stuck out to us as a new and cool place to try where we wouldn't just get basic American food. However, we were met with attempts at innovation that just fell a bit short. We started with drinks, but my boyfriend's first two choices were unavailable (we were eating at like 530). We had a few tacos, including the Korean, the carnitas and the duck confit. They were all pretty messy (the tortillas fell apart immediately) and we were just generally nonplussed by the food. It was also super dark inside which was a little uncomfortable. I think that I would have liked to just walk up and eat at the window bar as the food and drink situation would have met that expectation."}
{"text":"Our sixth or seventh visit - Tako never disappoints; as downtown dwellers, for my wife & I, Tako has become our \"go to\" place with neighbor Butcher & The Rye a close second.  If you're an Old Fashion drinker, try their anejo tequila based version - spectacular.  Last night's Lamb taco special was out of this world delicious.  Update - one year later - this place continues to satisfy!  We love the chips and guacamole, I'm still a big fan of their tequila based Old Fashion cocktail and we have yet to try a taco we dislike ... altho I haven't yet summoned the guts to try the octopus."}
{"text":"Literally... my favorite restaurant ever!  Hands down best tacos and guac ever. Love the atmosphere as well. Very trendy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is cool.   Too cool. Should I be here? Oh great I should.    The feel is unparalleled in the city and the background music is my mid 90's playlist of hip hop (west side).   The food is creative with tasty innovative takes on Guacamole.  The tacos were fine.   Cocktails grounded in Rum instead of the over present whiskeys is refreshing.  Recommend this place more for drinks and ambience than food."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I had to try this place! Wow! What an amazing place. From the second we arrived to the end of dessert it was one of my favorite meals in a long time. To start I had the passion fruit margarita which was sweet and spicy and plenty of tequila. We ordered the chips and the homemade guacamole which was with out doubt the best I've ever eaten Then we had the queso fundido which was spicy and rich and very tasty, two perfect apps for a table of 4. Then we all had the tacos.... I had the bestik which was waygo beef and spices outstanding my wife had the mushroom which was incredible and my kids both had the pollo which may have been just a bit too spicy for their tastes Some of the best tacos I've ever had, but the atmosphere made the meal! Cool music, cool art work and exceptional service. Our waiter Damian knew every bit of the menu and was super helpful this being our first time. He was fast and friendly and very knowledgable. Reservations are a must unless you sit outside on the sit up bar which fills up fast I can't wait to return to try every taco o the menu!"}
{"text":"The hype is real and totally validated. Everything from the food, to the decor, to the drinks and service were outstanding. You may have to wait for a table or have a hard time getting in, but it'll be worth it, I assure you. This is an awesome Asian/Mexican fusion taco place with some unique taco combos, customized guacamole with lots of mix-ins, and an outstanding drink menu. My favorites of the night were the chorizo tacos with creamy romesco sauce, carnitas with chicharrones and salsa verde, and the bistec taco, which is made with wagyu beef.   Believe it or not, my favorite thing may have been the drink(s) I ordered - the Spicy Passion Fruit margarita. It's spicy and sweet, made with tequila, passionfruit, lime, orange liquor and habanero. Such a fiery zip! Had more than a few of these.  All in all, worth the stop AND the wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place could not have been more perfect for us. We like nice, cozy, yet pretty active / \"jumpin'\" places. This place MORE than fits the bill. It's small, pretty dark inside, with awesome attention to detail. I love the octopus arm light fixtures, the bar area is amazing looking, and even the bathroom was cute! The upstairs has a little balcony space with really neat lighting... Almost looks like an old theater or something. I cannot say enough how much I loved the inside. I had a margarita, which was delicious. We shared the thrice fried wings, and man were they AMAZING!! They even gave us hot towels for our hands after eating them. My husband and I split the fish tacos and the Korean tacos... They were absolutely perfect. Those guys have their flavors on point...phew... They were sooo crazy good. Okay, now that I've told you how great this place is about a hundred times... Get your ass over there! I would recommend a reservation though, or sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Tako lives up to the hype.   Probably my second favorite place in Pittsburgh, behind Gaucho.  I had an order of the Korean Tacos, which were delicious. They had a nice little kick to 'em and were loaded with fresh ingredients. Two of these guys had me feeling pretty full.   Anything you order will be fantastic, but definitely order TWO orders of the papas bravas... you will not want to share with your SO, date, friends, nor family. Who knew potatoes could be so good?"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying tako. Made a reservation for 5 PM right when they opened for dinner.   The chips and salsa were pretty good. It's nice that you get three favors if salsa for the price.   We inquired about the \"Board,\" which includes 6 pairs of tacos for $75. The catch was you had to order 6 different types of tacos (so no option to get 2 chicken, 3 steak, and 2 fish...etc) and you couldn't order off the specials menu.   The chicken taco was delicious. The ingredients were super fresh. The steak taco was good too. Would order both again.   The service was pretty slow, but our table was up on the second floor and the place was packed. The atmosphere was great, so we really didn't mind.   Definitely a cool spot in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Condado - right down the street, just as cool of an atmosphere, and half the price. It's a great budget-friendly substitute."}
{"text":"I ended up here for lunch one day and was really underwhelmed and disappointed considering I had heard such great things about the food here.  The lunch menu small and the food was okay.  I decided to give it another shot and go back for dinner to get the full menu.  It definitely didn't disappoint the second time around and was a totally different experience.  I had the poke which was excellent as well as the korean tacos.  For first timers I recommend making sure you go for dinner and not lunch on your initial visit."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fun atmosphere. Loved the Guac and salsa. The chorizo tacos were great and very filling. Enjoyed the mezcal too. Will definitely be back on my next visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place has an industrial feel. Pretty intimate downstairs and not a whole lot of room to move around. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the bartenders do an excellent job of keeping up when the place gets slammed about 8pm on a Saturday. I'd definitely make reservations as this place stays steadily busy. I had the al pastor tacos and the pork was incredibly tender and perfectly marinated. The pineapple was plentiful as well but not over bearing. The street corn was also excellent. It was a little creamier than most but it was still packed with flavor."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great.  I love their drinks I've tried most of their drinks and their food is also great. I'll make sure to try the tasting taco menu!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about tako. Go here, I'm serious. (And make a reservation right now because apparently there's always a substantial wait.)  Tako is octopus in spanish (apparently) but it also is representative of a menu primarily made of tacos. Unique combinations of beef, chicken, octopus, crispy fish, and vegetables adorn warm taco shells. (2 Per order ranging from $12 - $16)   I had the baja fish tacos which were absolutely perfect. I was also told that the beef and \"tako\" tacos were fantastic.   I probably could have eaten three tacos except for the fact that we started with the guacamole and the queso dip. Both were phenomenal and I highly recommend.   Spicy cucumber marg was also great."}
{"text":"Tako is a great restaurant! They really have it down. The food was delicious, the service was good, absolutely loved the atmosphere and decor..my only complaint was the music was playing WAY TOO LOUD! I get it..they're going for the \"hip trendy\" bar thing with a live DJ, which is cool but if you can't even hear the person sitting right next to you that's just too loud. But besides that the food was perfect! Started with the chips and salsa, which comes with a selection of 3 different salsas..all very good! They also have a \"build your own\" guacamole menu! LOVE IT! I've never been to a restaurant where you can pick whatever you want to add to your guacamole dip. Ordered the basic guacamole and added mangoes and fried onions. Delicious! Also ordered the fish tacos which were so good. The fish was nice and crispy, not greasy and lots of flavor in the taco. I do wish they sold their tacos individually instead of 2 per order. That way you can order 2 different types of tacos instead of getting 2 of the same thing.  You can never have too many taco joints around the city and I really hope Tako sticks around!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as always. Service was mediocre. Would give 5 stars if the service was a little better."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I recommend that you share your food with whom you are having dinner with so everyone can sample all of their great food! Their tako (octopus) taco's are good, and I usually don't like seafood. You will want to eat it quickly though while it is still hot or it gets chewy if you let it cool off too much."}
{"text":"Good, creative taco options seriously overpriced. I got the mushroom tacos and they were bursting with flavor and definitely a new favorite. My boyfriend got the octopus tacos which were also good. The prices are the pain point- you don't get enough to fill you up with just one order."}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite restaurant in the city. Beet tostadas are everything! It's always pretty booked solid (for good reason) so you'll have to make a reservation WAY in advance for any large group dinner. My husband and I usually go and wait for a seat at the bar. Food and drinks are all amazing!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation to tako an entire month in advance, and I highly suggest you do the same. Even on a Sunday night in downtown Pgh, there were no tables open and the bar was constantly packed! I had been so excited during the month leading up to my reservation, let me tell you!! We sat upstairs at a larger table with my party of 5 for birthday dinners. It's very dark inside and I really loved the decor! I ordered two margs through the night, blood orange and watermelon basil. I preferred the watermelon, it was so fresh and both flavors complimented each other really well. Tako's menu is not that big, that's probably a good thing! Chips and salsa come with three different salsas (my fave was the mild). Made to order guac was a little over priced IMO, but so good! We ordered the plain one and added cojita cheese. The queso fundido got two thumbs up as well! We all ordered different tacos (chicken, mushrooms, al pastor, chorizo, carnitas) and all of us were pleased! I had the carnitas and my god, that delicious pork was crisped to perfection! I definitely cannot wait to go back to tako and try more things, hopefully sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good vibe & a cooland cool ambience. Great place to take a date. The food is super fresh and cocktails are also. Might be the best tacos you will have tasted. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place typifies Pittsburgh's new reputation for being a culinary city.  Looks / feels: Open kitchen, old Edison light bulbs, octopus tentacles, and a massive mural of the last supper. If there were ever a sexy craft cocktail and tequila bar in the belly of the kraken, this would be it.  Drinks: Fantastic craft cocktails and a separate menu dedicated to showing what sort of craft mastery can be done with plays on the simple margarita. Oh, and a sufficient selection of sipping tequilas.  Food: You literally can not go wrong ordering here. Pumped up, refined street food. Probably the best Tacos I've ever had, including octopus, beef tongue, steak, and mushroom. The poke, the ceviche, and the chef's selection guacamole were all fantastic appetizers.  Staff: Tako is secretly home to some of Pittsburgh's best bartenders (who also happen to be female), as well as some very skillful and fun-to-be-around servers."}
{"text":"I took my mother here last week while she was in town before we went and saw a play that evening. My expectations where high based on reviews and what friends had said about this place. The food was great. Atmosphere was hipster for sure, but that doesn't bother me - so so dark inside. It is pretty expensive... That is the biggest negative to the place. $6+ a taco is pretty crazy and you have to buy them in doubles. I'm glad I finally went and it was everything I hoped it would be, definitely deserves at least 4 stars but probably not a place I'll be going to often or jumping to take other visiting guests to the burgh."}
{"text":"Delicious! I went here with my boyfriend a couple weeks after it opened! We had a reservation and they sat us early and had great service the entire night- which was surprising since it was so new! We loved the make your own guac! There are a lot of options for it. We added mango and peppers! I wish other places put mango in their guac!   For the 2 of use, we ordered the korean tacos and the chorizo tacos! Both were very filling and awesome! I am not the biggest fan of eggs, but the fried egg on the chorizo taco was great!  They also make fun drinks- everything has tequila in it, and my tequila hating boyfriend found a drink that he likes!  This is a fun new place in downtown. I like the idea of the outside bar on the street. We went on a Friday night. There a dj playing music, which was interesting. It made for a very loud setting. I don't think my parents would have enjoyed that. I was thinking it was their way to speed up the customers since it was so new, had a booked night, and plenty of walk ups!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here with my girlfriend. The $10 signature drinks were great. The menu isn't too large, so it's nice. We ordered 3 different kinds of tacos and all were amazing. I would tell you which ones, but other people around us got different ones and those seemed to be just as amazing. Their signature taco is the octopus one. It was amazing. The prices are good and the food was great. The place is pretty dark, but the atmosphere was very nice. The food came out quick, and they had a nice open kitchen. They have a few stools out on the street which would be awesome in the summer to sit there and have a few drinks and food."}
{"text":"Love this place so much and their margaritas and salsa and tacos   The tall waiter was superb who used to serve us   Love the location"}
{"text":"I am all about Farm to Fork. I think this place has pretty much nailed it. Everything is from fresh ingredients. That's how I like my food. I don't like additives, preservatives or MSG. This place has amazing fresh food. The atmosphere is pretty cool as well. We have been a few times and have never been disappointed. The street corn for an appetizer for six dollars is so wonderfully delicious. Any taco that you order will impress you. The tortillas are made there on site. You can watch the making of them in the open kitchen. The cocktails are fabulous. I had a sweet yellow roasted pepper margarita, also the cucumber margarita. The drinks are definitely creative. Tako connects to Butcher and the Rye, also owned by the same company. Love this place, it makes me want to decorate our home with octopuses."}
{"text":"This restaurant group has the most AMAZING staff and food. Tako never fails to make us so incredibly happy. Worth every penny and worth the wait- even if you have to make an 11pm reservation!"}
{"text":"After a failed attempt without reservations (2 hour wait?!), we got our stuff together and planned ahead.  Totally worth it!    The place is way bigger than it looks and very different from what you'd assume if you were just looking at the part you can see from the street (the open kitchen with the outdoor barstools).   Inside, it's dark and dungeon-ish, but in a very attractive way.  The octopus sconces, iron and wood decor, and Mexican candles lend the place a really fun vibe.     The food was amazing.  We ordered the queso and two special taco plates.   One of the specials was shrimp with a bunch of deliciousness including pistachios.  It was a great fresh combo and I definitely wish it was on the regular menu.  The other special was a cheesesteak taco.  This was not your average cheesesteak - tender strips of actual steak - not the processed pressed stuff you think of when you think cheesesteak.   Both specials were absolutely delicious!   Each plate came with two tacos, which was a pretty good portion for the price and quality.     The queso appetizer was really the only thing I had a comment about.   The queso itself was awesome.   The soft tortillas it was served with were awesome.  The combo, though, was a little awkward.  Do you make a very cheesy burrito?  Try and dip/scoop with the soft tortilla?  We tried it a bunch of different ways; but in the end, we kind of just wanted some chips to scoop up all that rich and creamy queso.     Service?  Also excellent.  Our server was prompt, attentive, and friendly.   As an added bonus, we asked where the restroom was on the way out.  He pointed us in the direction, but took the time to tell us that there was a big line and we'd be better to try the one in the attached Butcher and the Rye (see my review of that place for why there was no line there).     Overall, a sure winner and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had the crab tacos for $20. Horrible. Fried and still has shell on underneath. Tasted like mush. Honestly the worst taco I ever had. Waste of money. Great atmosphere though."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting täk? and I loved it. There was a line outside but I made a reservation and was seated quickly. The atmosphere was amazing and nothing like I've ever seen before. We ordered chips and salsa and it was really good. The chips were fresh and we also got 3 different salsas. Our waiter was so cool and nice. He gave us recommendations on what to order next. I ordered the Korean tacos by recommendation of the waiter. THEY WERE SO GOOD! I also loved the menu; it was like a newspaper. The place is so hipster and I love it. I plan on going back for my birthday."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Tako, both great experiences. We came in around 8:30 on a Wednesday with 4 people, no reservations. We were told the earliest available table would be at 10:15, but got a text about ten minutes later and we're seated immediately. I would definitely suggest trying to make a reservation in advance. The ambiance of the place is great, the bar is beautiful as is the mural that the restaurant has become famous for. I started with a classic margarita, which I highly recommend, it was quite good. Also good are the watermelon margaritas. We then got classic guacamole and a poke bowl for the table. The guacamole was only ok, I found it to be overpriced for the amount that you are getting and overall lacking in taste. The poke bowl, however, was amazing and is a must try. I got the chorizo tacos while others at my table got the pollo asada, Korean short rib, and lamb tacos. The short rib tacos were good, solid 7/10 and the pollo asada were a solid 8/10. The chorizo tacos really stood out, the meat was delicious and the fried egg really made it worth it and even more so delicious, a 9/10. However, the lamb tacos stole the show. The meat was perfect and the cucumber with mint sauce just made the Taco unforgettable. The lamb tacos are a MUST TRY. We ended the meal with a tres leches cake, which I honestly found forgettable compared to the tacos themselves. I give this place a definite 5/5, it truly lives up to the hype. Pictured are the chorizo tacos and classic margarita."}
{"text":"Great tacos and gauc! Wish it were easier to get into and less expensive considering portions."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW!  I have been traveling for years to Pittsburgh, but just ran into this place earlier this year.  Made my second visit last week and it didn't disappoint.  The civeche appetizer was delicious, and so were the mushroom tacos....or should I say tako';-)  Gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh for my birthday weekend and actually scored a reservation here on Cinco de Mayo. I was very excited to try Tako because of the great reviews on Yelp. The food was great but service could have been better so I took off one star for that.   Our server seemed so annoyed every time she had to check on us - we didn't have any complaints or extra requests, btw. Just margs, two apps, and the tako tacos. Also, I mentioned to the staff that we were celebrating my birthday (I was overly excited) and they didn't do anything. Now, I wasn't expecting any kind of Applebee's song and dance but maybe just a \"happy birthday\" or small piece of dessert? Nope. Kind of rained on my parade ):  The atmosphere was trendy and hip which we really enjoyed. I didn't feel that the lighting was too dark like some people have mentioned. We really liked the DJ instead of boring dinner music and it wasn't so loud that it interrupted regular dinner conversation.  Overall, great food and atmosphere but their service didn't really seem to match on the Saturday night we visited."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good but the wait is terrible. We had reservations and still had to wait 30 minutes. That wouldn't have been terrible if there were seats open at the bar to wait."}
{"text":"First thing I ordered was the Coconut Margarita.  Could've stopped there. I thought to myself and my companion later said, \"That might be the best margarita I've ever had.\" But since eating was the goal, ceviche, queso, octopus and veggie tacos were ordered. The queso was really good, but large and very filling and the tacos incredible. Yes, its expensive. But there are octopuses (sp?) everywhere and the bartender is rad. Definitely go to tako."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Tako all I can say is I love this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous cocktails and food- particularly love the make your own guacamole.  Difficult to get a reservation, but worth the wait.  Have been there 5 times and have never had a bad cocktail/beer/app/dinner.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Täk??! Seriously, it's one of the most unique spots in Pittsburgh. I can appreciate the level of detail that went into this restaurant. The dimmed lights allow for an intimate dining experience! I love the seats outside that allow you to watch the chefs cook your meal and that is something I want to do in the future. The chandelier's are GORGEOUS and so are the murals on the walls.  I have been here twice and after my first time I wanted my mom to see what the hype was about. So far I have had the Korean taco, the al pastor and the pollo asada. Honestly I couldn't even tell you my favorite because they were all so delicious and unique. The different ingredients mixed together really just produced some of the best flavor. The tacos are a pretty nice size for what you pay. I am pretty picky when it comes to taco shells and these shells are just the right amount of soft. They are not dry which is a pet peeve of mine and most importantly they held all the ingredients together without breaking. My mom was pretty pleased with her visit! She ordered the Korean taco and we ordered the chips and salsa to start. I would like to try the duck confet and the chorizo taco at my next visit! I highly recommend täk? if you want to be wowed by amazing tacos! Oh and make sure you make a reservation, at least a week or two in advance."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found this place. We made reservations far in advance because our first choice restaurant was already full for the weekend we were to be in town. I'm glad they were because this place is a gem! The decor is quirky and cute. They blast '90's-2000's hip hop (yes it's loud. Not my boyfriend's cup of tea but it's my favorite and i danced in my seat the whole time ). The margaritas were fantastic. I had the Thai coconut milk one and the pineapple jalapeño. Bf even commented that the pineapple jalapeño was one of the best margaritas he's ever tasted, and he has traveled far and wide! And the food. OMG the food. We went straight for the tacos. Each order comes with 2 tacos and we got 4 orders (ordered from my favorite to least favorite): Korean short rib, duck confit, the Tako (octopus), and the chorizo. For reference, even my least favorite was the best taco I had ever had up until that point. I'm here in Pittsburgh for a wedding and I'm not sure when I'll be back...so I'm going to try to get into this place one more time this weekend just in case it will be awhile until I return!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we FINALLY got to Tako! The tacos (and salsas) were amazing and the margaritas (I had the pineapple/jalapeno one without the jalapeno) were wonderful. We sat at the bar, since we didn't plan ahead months in advance. The service was great and all the food we saw going by us looked amazing, too. I couldn't decide, since everything looked so good on the menu, so I took the suggestion of our bartender and she definitely steered me in the right direction, though all of us enjoyed our food. The tacos were also a lot bigger than I expected and filled me up more than I thought they would.   I can't wait to go back. There is so much I want to try!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. It's a small place with an open view to the kitchen where you can watch them make the tortillas. We had the quest fundito which was fantastic and the bistec tacos. Tacos were cooked to a perfect med rare and had a great char. Spicy cucumber margarita was excellent. If available try the special pumpkin seed salsa."}
{"text":"I travel for work and am always on the hunt for good restaurants. I found this place via high reviews on Yelp so I figured I'd give it a try. Let me start off by saying I love tacos. I love my modern tacos with a fusion of flavors, as well as traditional (onions, cilantro and sauce) but I was pretty disappointed. I arrived on Sunday around 6pm and it was pretty busy. I couldn't sit at a table as it's by reservation only so I waited about 15 minutes for a bar seat to open up.   The service was good. I'll give it 4/5. The bartenders were friendly and even gave me some recommendations on what places to check out in Pittsburgh.   The food was way overpriced. I'll give that a 1.5/5.   The food itself I give it a 2/5. I was recommended to try the papas bravas by one of the bartender. The potatoes were cooked well. They were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. But the orange sauce drizzles on top was way too salty for my taste (and I like salt). I then ordered the Korean tacos. Although the flavors were mostly there (again, a little on the salty side) I couldn't get over the grainy taste of the meat. I know this is likely due to the peanut sauce but you guys need to work on that. I love peanut sauce and this was just off. Maybe I had a bad batch. Either way: not my favorite."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Food was terrific and fresh- farm to table. A Mexican flair the atmosphere was really fun. We sat outside at the bar and watched the kitchen prepare meals. A fun group of food artisans. We had pollo and chorizo Tajo that were out standing. We had been wanting to try this restaurant and it worked out perfectly after a Pitt win over PSU. Put it on you list of must PGH places"}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere.  Maybe a little loud, get used to that it's an octopus party!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The mushroom tacos are my favorite and a must try. The cocktails are great, especially the cucumber gin. Great, friendly service. It is a little loud and tight, but not bad. Always packed. I'd recommend tako to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'd heard a lot about Tako and how amazing it was but didn't buy into the hype. I think I should have. My friend and I were fortunate enough to sit at the outside bar area that looks into the kitchen. The staff was so friendly and our food was incredible!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Amazing tacos and cocktails.  Only issue is it difficult to get a table with less than 4 weeks notice and it is expensive for the type of food"}
{"text":"We got the taco board. There was five of us and we were savages! These tacos are simply amazing though! We tried the octopus, pork, pork and pineapple, chicken, steak, and chorizo! So tasty! Can't go wrong with any of them!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! And this comes from a Mexican who loves real Mexican tacos! But I have to say that even in Mexico it is hard to find a place where they have good Tacos al pastor! Well my friends let me tell you that I found a place in Pittsburgh that makes one of the best Tacos al Pastor in the world! Yes yes in the world!!!   The only thing I hate about this place is that because their Tacos are so good a lot of people go eat there and reservations are very rare to find for a good dinner time so what I do is I go there alone and just go to the bar and enjoy those amazing tacos by my self with a nice cold Victoria Mexican beer!   This message is so people never go there! please! so I can take my whole family at once, for once! Lol   Enjoy it people!!! sincerely this place is amazing! They should consider opening a few more locations! I'm sure they will have great success wherever they go!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The atmosphere was was interesting and fun! Loved the tacos and salsa!"}
{"text":"You definitely need to check this place out. We had to make reservations for six people a couple of weeks before. It was definitely worth the wait. The place itself is small and very dark which I wasn't a big fan of. The menu is literally a newspaper! I thought that this concept was pretty neat.   For appetizers, we ordered chips and salsa, street corn and guacamole. The best one was the street corn, hands down!! It was really creamy and the corn just made it taste so amazing! The guacamole was also one of my favorites. It was really tasty and different than the other guacamoles that I've tried elsewhere. We wanted to get the taco sampler which was 6 pairs of tacos for $65, however, you can only select different tacos and cannot repeat any flavors. Therefore we ended up ordering individually as everyone seemed to want the Korean tacos and we shared one to try another flavor. I ended up with one Korean taco and one Tako (octopus) taco. They were both delicious! I was surprised that the tako one was actually tender and not chewy. The tacos are not that big but definitely flavorful.   I definitely enjoyed my experience but these tacos are quite pricey for the amount of food. I also didn't like the super dark atmosphere to the point that you couldn't really see what was inside your food. There is only one bathroom in the restaurant and when I used it, the floor was all wet."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The street corn was absolutely to die for!!! Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is great! For sure a return to place when back in Pittsburgh for Steelers games!!!!"}
{"text":"So winding out the end of year in Pittsburgh and decided after flying in a little bit early to give Tako a try. I had heard quite a bit of mixed reviews to date and it had been on my bucket list for trying out so glad I was finally able to do so. Since I was in relatively early on a Sunday, there was no wait and there were plenty of seats to be found at the bar. I pulled up a chair as close to the right end of the bar as possible so I could get a glimpse of the chefs preparing the food. The décor is the whole dark/mysterious/casual vibe with the DJ like music playing in the background.   They provide their menus in newspaper format with a list of separate specials if you desire to peruse. I will admit the prices are a bit steep here for the portion but where else can you get something like this in Pittsburgh. The menu is broken down into multiple small plates and then multiple varieties of tacos. They also have a relatively large selection of adult beverages and the bartenders are pretty knowledgeable even with the standard curve balls of \"surprise me with an awesome drink.\" The tacos are a decent portion and if you do not eat tons, I could see one order of tacos and an appetizer being enough to satisfy the hunger. If you are super hungry then I could see two orders of taco doing the trick. The multia was a special and pretty solid. It came with mole and avocado. All ingredients were blended well together and I loved the freshness of the cilantro and onion sitting on top. It was a solid way to start the meal washed down with their version of an old fashioned. I followed up with waiting for my Korean tacos which came out quickly afterwards on a wooden board branded with the words tako. The tacos were well made and did not skimp on the ingredients. They were packed with flavors including kochujang and loved the cucumbers sliced into it. I would definitely recommend asking for the housemade hot sauce which adds a nice kick to the overall dish. I wrapped up with some lychee drink which was solid but the hummingbird at the end was the solid closer.   All in all, I thought this place was great and im a fan of what they are doing. Not sure how easy it is to just swing by for a bite but definitely a place I will try to hit back up in the future. The bartenders were also super friendly and very helpful. Def a plus"}
{"text":"Their signature Tako taco doesn't impress me much. It was overpriced, tacos are tacos after all. I have heard about their tako a lot before visiting, probably I overestimated.   I recommend to try their duck taco instead of octopus taco.  It's with well cooked soft duck meat with crunch skin. Chief's Guacamole is Hawaiian style, with tuna, seaweeds and a bit of soy sauce. It greatly matches with margaritas.   Always crowded. No possibility to book at a reasonable dinning time otherwise have to book 1 month in advance.   #tip: you can be seated without booking when you come at the opening hour."}
{"text":"The queso fondido is AMAZING! Their margaritas are amazing. Do yourself a favor and ask for their hot sauce as well."}
{"text":"Tako has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants that I've ever been to. Ambiance, food, drinks and service all get 5 stars from me. The chorizo tacos were definitely my favorite and I love that you have the option to add as many ingredients as you want into their delicious guacamole. Great experience and I'm already counting down till I get to come back!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had! My sister-in-law came to visit for the weekend and we went here for food and drinks and had such a great time. We ordered the taco board and were able to choose 6 different tacos and were not disappointed by any of them. If you're not hungry I'd definitely recommend them for drinks as well! I had the spicy passion fruit margarita and the \"fro-ze\" and they were phenomenal! We actually went back again in the same week andddd might be going back again next week haha."}
{"text":"The overall ambiance of täk? was pretty cool and definitely different from other taco places in the downtown area. However, I had to make a reservation about 5 weeks in advance for a Friday at 6:30 pm. This wouldn't seem so ridiculous if the place was packed, but there were empty tables that remained empty the whole time I was there. It's a casual vibe and my friends and I were in nice shirts and jeans--by no means underdressed. However, our waitress made us feel uncomfortable as if we were out of place. She was curt and looked at us as if we had five heads when we ordered drinks (we are all 21+). Overall, the food was fine. It was not worth a 5 week waiting period. They were good tacos, but definitely overpriced. The experience felt rushed and we were out of there within 35 minutes tops. Next time I want tacos and margaritas, I'll be going back to Condado Tacos."}
{"text":"So it was Thursday night ...we had our reservation (done right from my trusty yelp app)lined up but due to a situation at my house I called earlier in the day to see if we could change to later gentlemen on the phone was very nice and moved it later. Front is where all the tacos are being made It's a glass enclosed kitchen you can watch the chefs at work...it's very cool We arrived and were warmly greeted and seated Downstairs  It's one long padded bench with high tops for two The other side are metal stools The other side is the bar Waitress was friendly and perky we had water instantly  And drink orders quickly taken Guacamole has it's own menu Made fresh there are all sorts of fixins you can add from blue cheese to sausages  Menu had tacos of all sorts including octopus ...octopi seems to be a theme here ...walls are adorned with these sea creatures The is a poke bowl  We ordered plain ol guac it came with warm not to salty warm chips delish  I had salmon tacos  Soft little warm tacos a piece of warm salmon with slaw and some eggplant very tasty  My dining partner had bbq beef she loved I have a thing for light bulbs and the upstairs section has lots of cool all different bulbs as the lighting  The pros . Yum food and great service  The cons the metal stools uncomfortable and the noise level it's pretty darn loud Average 14 dollars for 2 taco is a little pricy considering portion size and food type Parking was difficult this Thursday evening we parked in the garage down the street Side note ...a gentleman sat down at the empty table next to us (there were two) after a few minutes they asked him not to sit there ...his friend had ordered take out taco apparently you can't sit and wait they left the tables were still empty when we left about 15 min later"}
{"text":"Came here for date night with my fiance during restaurant week (Jan 9) and beat the crowd. Unless you have a reservation, the wait for a table can be more than an hour. We got there right when they opened at 5pm and sat at the bar since that area is open seating/first come, first served. We ordered one of the restaurant week specials which was a pretty good deal because we got to try a few dishes: street corn, ceviche, guac, the korean bbq taco, pork belly taco and some chips and tomatillo on the side. Everything was so good. The only thing I wasn't diggin was my drink - I ordered the Lychee & Pepper, since I'm a big fan of lychee. I could not taste the lychee at all. While the presentation of it was nice, the flavor was unexpected and a little off for me. 5 stars for the food, customer service and really nice ambience!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly filling , great flavors and a great atmosphere to compliment the delicious watemelon-basil margarita"}
{"text":"My father and I ate at Täko on Friday night around 10 PM. We just got into Pittsburgh after a long 12 hour Amtrak journey from Boston and decided to grab something to eat near our hotel. We came upon Täko and were instantly intrigued by the outdoor seating that looked into the kitchen. We waited outside for a few minutes then realized you are supposed to go in and put your name on the waiting list. We spoke to the hostess, who was very nice,and she seated us immediately at the outside counter.   Damien, our waiter, was awesome from the get go. He recommend the Tako taco (grilled octopus) as well as a guacamole blend and a few drinks. In addition to the tako I ordered the Korean taco. The Oaxaca Old fashion was a great Mexican spin on a traditional old fashion and Damien gave us a little background history about how that drink tied into the whiskey rebellion. The tuna guacamole was the perfect fusion of Japanese and Mexican flavors. The umami flavors really came through and they were not scant on the amount of the fish they included in it.   The entrees were also delicious. I highly recommend the grilled octopus taco. The fresh lemon juice and the peanut sauce made for a refreshing and savory coalescence of flavors. The octopus was very tender and the portions were generous. The Korean taco had a good amount of spice it blended the flavors very well. For dessert we had the whipped cheese cake, which was a modern deconstructed version a traditional cheese cake. It spiraled up around a center of blueberries blackberries and raspberries. They topped it off with a creamy vanilla ice cream that stole the show. All of Damien's recommendations were successes. This restaurant is a must for anyone in the area-great food and staff."}
{"text":"There's nothing WRONG with Tako.  The venue is sick--every detail is well thought out, from the Edison bulb ceiling lights to the soft core porn octopus wall murals.  It was really cool to get a glimpse into their impressively tiny glass-walled kitchen, and the service couldn't have been better.  But to me, Tako is not a restaurant--it's a bar.    The DJ keeps the pop music loud, and on a Thursday night, we struggled to hear the other end of our table of 5.  The Mushroom Tacos and on special Pork Belly Tacos we ordered were delicious, with all their components really sync, but the tacos themselves were the only delicious items on the menu.  Our group also tried the Kale and the Street Corn and made-our-own Guac, and none of them impressed.  The salad was tiny and lackluster, with the sesame seeds being the singular standout ingredient, and the chopped roasted poblano bits in the guacamole made every bite of the (small) dish bitter.    Sad starters aside, the customer left with very few desirable menu items, and the focus really does seem to be on the drinks.  That being said, this isn't necessarily bad if that's what you're looking for.  I wasn't.    The bottom line--come thirsty but not hungry, pass on the appetizers, and expect to pay $18 for a pair of their signature Tako tacos (You might hope that these are larger than your standard sized $2 street tacos.  They're not.).  It was a decent enough experience for a Thursday night, and I definitely understand all the hype, but I probably won't be back.  Would I have chosen  this place for an obnoxious screamfest reunion with my sorority sisters?  Sure.  Would I make another reservation 3 weeks out for a nice dinner with my fiancee?  Def not.  Personally, I prefer restaurants where the cooking is the focus.  If Richard DeShantz is trying to offer Pittsburgh a higher-end version of the over-copied Roy Choi concept, it's the food that's going to have to step up and deliver."}
{"text":"The decor and theme here are done really well. It's like a Day of The Dead/Latin American Catholicism/Octopus vibe with sultry-glam lighting, all of which naturally go together. Seriously, it works, and it's sexily done. We sat upstairs and I especially appreciated the huge portrait of Jesus and his disciples behind me and the huger portrait of an octopus to my left.  I loved everything that I ate and drank here, and I didn't even get the most popular items.  For an appetizer, we had the street corn (sriracha mayo / chili / lime / cotija cheese): With an intensely flavorful and tangy quality, this was probably the best street corn I've ever had.  And the poke (yellowfin tuna / spicy soy dressing / sesame mayo / lime / rice crackers) was the most creative take on the dish that I've had. Just the look of the dish is revolutionary. On the left side, you have your standard fresh bites of fish topped with nice creamy bits of sesame-flavored mayonnaise. And on the right? It's a tart, lemony foam. Then, just when you think you have this dish all figured out, you find a hidden bed of silky guacamole at the bottom of the bowl. It's all awesome.  I sampled a number of the cocktails, but ordered the lychee and pepper margarita (mezcal / lychee / bauchant orange liquor / pickled thai chilis / lime). This wasn't groundbreaking, but it was very good. A nice balance of heat and sweet lychee. Yay!"}
{"text":"The tacos we got were very good and they are a nice portion size.  The waitstaff was prompt and very friendly.  I'm giving it four stars because we went on a Saturday night and they had very very VERY loud dance music playing that made it impossible to have a conversation with my date.  My advice for this joint, either remove the music entirely or lower it so it is barely audible and is background music.  This is a restaurant, not a night club."}
{"text":"Excellent food. My favorite place to eat. Strong drinks. Cool place for Dinner or drinks. Be prepared for close quarters, it's a little loud to chat."}
{"text":"This is a different type of taco place. Know that going into this. Tako prides itself with a Asian Fusion creations and honestly I think it misses the mark in some places. Starters: Poke and Chips and Salsa. Both delicious separately, very odd pairing the two together. The Poke was well seasoned with big fish pieces and the chips that come with were crispy and flavorful.    I ordered the large tako sampler, aka the \"board.\" The presentation is flashy and holds small portions. Essentially a large board is filled with 12 tacos, 6 pairs. This fed a party of 5. This option allows you to pick and choose the tacos you want. The steak and the mushroom ones were the most flavorful and by far my favorite.    The carnitas were a little bland, and some of the tacos started blending together with Al Pastor and Pollo Asado. Knowing this is a more upscale place, I had higher expectations for distinct flavors to draw me back. Other competitors are better priced, portioned, and generally impressionable. If you are looking for a fancier, hip dinner, Tako is good to impress out of towners. If you're looking for a good meal and not break your bank, PGH has many better other options."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for food and drinks in the city. Spicy marg has the perfect level of heat. The atmosphere is fantastic as well as the service all the way around. I always have to get the tuna belly guac-a collision of my two obsessions. Octopus taco is also always a must for me. The only negative is how hard it is to get a table on a weekend!"}
{"text":"Duck taco too dried & the other taco not that great , so disappointed, not worth the price we paid!"}
{"text":"Tako has a really unique and elevated menu for its cuisine. We got the corn, tuna, and wings as appetizers. The corn and tuna were just mediocre for us - we thought they were over seasoned and a little harsh on the taste buds. The wings were cooked really well, the meat literally fell off of it. We got three tacos to share, the octopus and the Korean pork. They both were absolutely wonderful and totally demolished the apps to be honest. I will definitely go back for them but probably won't eat any apps next time. We didn't drink so I can't speak to that but the drink menu looked like it was on point! Maybe I'll try those next time ;)"}
{"text":"I am from southern CA where we get real Mexican food. I know this is a fusion place too, but still I am picky when it comes to Mexican. Can't complain here though. Was pretty good with that considered, plus the drinks were good and cool atmosphere. Reminded me of a place I'd hang out at in Hollywood or something. Has that cool/trendy vibe."}
{"text":"Seated last night with a reservation for 6, so i'll start there. 6 Guys in a booth just doesn't work. I'm not sure how the restaurant would know we were 6 guys, so i'll cut them a little slack, but the overall level of comfort-ability really suffered. Sans the tiny tables the lighting a little dark, with a pretty upbeat music selection. Not for everyone, but i enjoyed it.  The pineapple jalapeno  margarita was exceptional. Perfect amounts of both advertised flavors. It's extremely easy to overpower with the jalapeno flavor, so kudos to the barkeep for making this drink as enjoyable as i would've hoped.   The biggest flaw was in the appetizers, specifically the guacamole. When the guac comes out brown, it makes it a little hard for me to really enjoy it. Albeit the taste wasn't as bad as it looked, but those who know guac, know that its brown because it lacked freshness or the proper acidity. I'll go with the former, as the taste was pretty decent. Either way, for tako to have such quality ingredients and preparation for their main courses, the fact that they let the guac go out brown really shocked me.  Main courses were top notch. Ive eaten tacos across the country and the the Duck Confit taco is quite possibly the best taco i've had the pleasure of tasting. Perfectly cooked duck with perfect seasoning and saucing. The garnishes were exactly where they needed to be. The Korean taco was stellar as well, with a great housemade bbq sauce complimenting the perfectly cook pork.  Overall the 4/5 due to the poor guac and the tight table quarters. Would 100% come back."}
{"text":"Very trendy place.  The tacos were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Our server was fantastic.  The hostesses had lost our reservation, which was a bit concerning, and they seemed to not really believe we had one, which was slightly annoying, but they sat us anyway!  Our server was lovely.  The drinks are pretty pricey.  Louder music playing.  Not romantic, but good tacos and definitely a \"see and be seen\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Legit. Not a traditional taco place, but everything I've had was excellent. Get the octopus, obviously."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows my Yelp reviewing profile knows that it is biased towards hole in the wall restaurants rather than the trendy places that garner all the attention.  Having said that, I occasionally enjoy checking out the latest trendy spots to see if they live up to the hype that they generate.  I'd walked past Tako with curiosity many times before it opened, so when it finally opened for business this summer, I looked for a chance to check it out.  That chance came when I received comped tickets to see The Wedding Singer musical at the Benedum last night.   When I received the tickets three weeks ago, I talked my friend into checking out Tako with me, and she agreed, so I immediately made a reservation.  Upon entering, we had to wait for about two minutes before we being acknowledged, since the hostess was on the phone and had her back to us.  After that amount of time had passed, another woman came over, checked us in, and led us to our table, which was downstairs across from the bar.  The first thing that was immediately apparent to us was how small, dark, and loud the restaurant is--as others have mentioned, it can be challenging to carry on a conversation here.  The tables are so close together that my friend had to squeeze past our neighbors to get to the booth against the wall, and the service was slightly awkward because the waitstaff came uncomfortably close to our table when they were serving the tables on either side of us.  Speaking of service, while our waiter was generally knowledgeable and helpful, I felt that we sat for a bit too long at several points, continuing the theme from when we walked in.  Together, these factors are the reason why I'm not awarding 5 stars.  Having said that, the food was as amazing as all of the other reviews and my previous experience with Tako's sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes, led me to believe.  My friend and I started off by sharing an order of queso fundido (cheese dip with chorizo and cilantro; $10), which was extremely rich and flavorful to the point that I felt satiated with slightly less than half of the portion (my friend ate the remainder)--something unheard of for me when it comes to cheese.  For entrees, I ordered the mushroom tacos, and my friend ordered the pollo asado tacos ($10 each).  Because the tacos come two to an order, we each traded one taco with one another so that we could each try both of them.  Both tacos were astoundingly complex in flavor and texture--needless to say, these aren't your typical taco stand tacos!  Although both were excellent, my favorite was the mushroom, which had just the right balance of savory, meaty flavor, vegetable notes, and richness from the sauce.  This is clearly 5 star new Mexican cuisine in terms of flavor--and the tacos are well-portioned and priced, to boot!  Overall, my friend and I really enjoyed Tako.  I'll definitely have to make it back to try the tako (octopus) taco, as well as some of the cocktails, both of which looked intriguing.  If you're like me, and prefer a quieter and brighter atmosphere, you may want to try to sit outside if the weather's nice, rather than in the restaurant itself.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I think the quality and the presentation of the food is amazing. My Bistec tacos was lacking flavor. I even put extra Valentina on it. I'm no chef and I am an extremely picky eater lol but I think if they cut the meat more thin it could help the shishito, salsa etc come through more. I also had the Thai Coconut Margarita and that was really tasty."}
{"text":"We sat in the upstairs area with reserved booths.  I understand the desired vibe of the space, but it was just too, too dark to really appreciate or enjoy our food. That being said, the queso with chorizo, and the guacamole with crab and corn were both delicious appetizers. The tacos we ordered were fine (a daily special with barbacoa, the Tako taco with octopus, and the chorizo taco with a fried egg on top). The drinks were good. The chocolate dessert was pretty terrible -- dry puff pastry with ganache, garnished with the smallest dollop of chocolate ice cream. The service was a tad hit or miss -- our waitress disappeared for long periods of time, but the only downside was for the restaurant --  I would have ordered another margarita. Would I return? We won't rush back. But we'll probably come back at some point simply because there are not enough good Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this one is certainly pretty good. Next time, we'll sit in the bar area which seems to have much more light."}
{"text":"GREAT tacos, excellent wings as app.  Did Tatko board.  2ea of 6 different great tacos.  Great service.  Server kept us from wasting $75 on food we couldn't have eaten.  Super honest and great food."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and did not disappoint. Great atmosphere and service, and the food was excellent. Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach as the servings are heftier than they look, but overall we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A little pricey and the portions are not the largest, yet Tako still gets 5 stars, because the tacos are that good. They were the best tacos that i have ever had. I wish i had more money to try everything. Was seated immediately, the decor is awesome, the staff was incredible. The music was super cool as well. I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my husband at Tako last night.  The food was awesome. I had the mushroom tacos.  I also enjoyed a wonderful sangria.  The waiter was excellent and the entire staff was very pleasant.  The only downside was it was very loud (and a bit hard to talk to my husband)."}
{"text":"This place is not good for vegetarians.  The only vegetarian taco had mushrooms in it which I hate.  We had some chips and salsa and I got two appetizers for my meal.  It was delicious, but way too expensive for what I got.  My boyfriend who does eat meat really enjoyed his food though."}
{"text":"This is a very overhyped place with extremely poor service and with just a couple of vegetarian options. We went there with reservations, did not like the table given to us as it was right outside the toilets. Since this was at 10 pm there were multiple other tables empty including one outdoors but they refused to move us and actually said \" this is the only  table for you\" . After that with the only vegetarian taco option I requested if we could replace goat cheese with some other cheese and the server replied in a crisp manner \"no\". Overall very inflexible attitude of the staff. All the food that we ordered was decent but nothing great."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. great takos, great drinks, great atmosphere. Menu is a bit pricey for my liking, so it was certainly a treat to go there. Definitely would recommend. I got a chicken tako, chips and guacamole (best guacamole ever!), and a frozen \"Baja blast\" margarita. Yes!!!"}
{"text":"HOOOLLYYY. Coolest taco bar to ever exist. The ambiance is amazing. The food is amazing. The service is amazing. Their kitchen is surrounded by glass so when you walk in you can watch each individual taco being crafted by hand by one of the many workers. The music is loud but fits the environment perfectly. Please make reservations. It was packed in there and we had to wait for seats at the bar. Also, if you're underage (like I am) and want something fun to drink, get one of their Mexican sodas (they call it something different on the menu but I'd rather not butcher the spelling). I got the pork tacos. Their guac and nachos are to die for as well. So are the churros. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I made a visit to Tako based on all the previous reviews here and many locations on the Internet calling Tako THE place to go when in Pittsburgh.  As many reviews have had recalled, I was looking forward to \"the best taco I've ever had\".  Like many other restaurants, the fish option here was clearly an afterthought.  Not bad, but pretty comparable to the fish tacos at Mad Mex, which for the price point is less of a value.  I think this could possibly be the best taco you've ever eaten if you don't typically eat tacos a lot.  My taco wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing.  Tako did have some redeemers though.  For starters, I got the poke and street corn.  I love street corn and thought this met the bid compared to similar corns I've had in New York and Miami.  This corn was different in that it wasn't on the cob but rather loose corn.  It was very sweet but it just made me question whether or not it was fresh.    The poke...was fantastic!  It was a concoction like no other!  One part tuna, one part guac, one part sweet sauce, one part crisps.  All my flavor and texture needs were met far beyond expectation.  I will say it's very much an acquired taste.  But if you have it, it sends you to the moon and back.  It was okay.  But for $50 a person, it's not really somewhere I'm gonna be dying to return to."}
{"text":"Terrible tacos. Terrible service. Stay away. Drinks are weak and over priced and staff are rude. Go to Bakersfield for great tacos, service and drinks."}
{"text":"Tako was really good, def a fun little joint. The drinks are killer and of course the tacos are great too. Better get a reservation ahead of time tho"}
{"text":"HEAVENLY!! Seriously - GO HERE! Everything is amazing and you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. The drinks, guac, tacos - it's all delicious. My boyfriend and I have tried just about everything and go back as much as we can. For dinner time & sitting at a booth, you have to make a reservation online (which gets booked months in advance) but you can stop in when they open and its first come/first serve - the bar is always first come though. I recommend the yellow jacket margarita, any style of guac, and the al pastor & Korean tacos."}
{"text":"Literally the best taco I have ever had, and have had many many tacos. Am such a big fan. Had the carnitas taco, and wow! Wow! Wow! It was the second time back and I was even more impressed. So highly recommend! The ceviche was so good also. Highly recommend also."}
{"text":"I honestly have to say that I never really was a huge fan of tacos. I have had them if friends ordered them, but I never really had a craving for it. Until now. Tako serves the best tacos in town for sure. I had a couple of different ones to try so far and I loved all of them. All of them have a unique combination of flavors with my favorite being the \"tako taco\". The octopus is grilled to perfection and is accompanied with a zingy sauce and greens. The amount of octopus you get for $18 is very reasonable! However, the only thing that did disappoint was the guacamole that everyone was raving about! We took the classic one and for my taste there wasn't enough lime and cilantro in it and was rather bland and to charge $11 for it, is a bit of an overkill.   Their margaritas however are really good, and so are their desserts. I also do love the the place itself (dark, fun and cozy) and most of the staff is really friendly and if you're ever picking up food you can watch the chefs preparing it. It can be quite hard to reserve a spot at this place so be prepared to wait a couple of weeks if you're a bigger group. I was usually quite lucky walking in on a Sunday afternoon without having to wait! Definitely one of my top 10 places to eat here. I'd give them 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very unique exotic taco joint!  Well definitely more than a taco joint everything is to die for!  Must visit if your in the area everything was delicious especially their papas bravas!"}
{"text":"Classic Margarita, Street Corn and Carnitas Tacos was a awesome dinner.  Definitely some of the best tacos in Pittsburgh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food as usual.  The Bistec and the Pork Belly tacos were legit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The ambiance is super chic and dark. Very vampy. We were seated upstairs overlooking the bar below. It was really cool. The tacos are big and the flavours are super innovative! They go great with their specialty cocktails. We tried the tail coconut margarita and the pinnaple jalapeño margarita. Both were perfect. Different and well balanced. The service was fantastic and the fast. Even though we had a large group!  Make sure to check out their weekly specials menu. The tuna tar tare tostada was absolutely delicious!! The speciality guacamole is a nice touch too. This place absolutely nails it! Wish I had a reason to go back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh must visit, hard to get in but worth the wait...So if you are thinking of checking out this spot make a reservation. Once you walk in you can see the kitchen staff working to make the great food. They also have a few sits attached to the building serving as a sort of chefs table section looking into the kitchen. The first thing we noticed was the music in the establishment was much to LOUD,Awful Loud. The reason why I gave a four star rating.... We sat a the bar and Molly quickly took charge of us, she recommend drinks and suggested some food items.I went with Molly's recommended drink \"Dusk till Dawn\" it was carefully crafted and delish. We then order Chips and salsa (3- hot, medium, mild) as well as guacamole from the build your guacamole menu. Appetizers were great. As for dinner we ordered the Carnitas ,(braised pork with gauc, fresh salsa verde, white onion, cilrantro, and chicharrones) and the Pollo Asado, (grilled chicken, avocado,white onion, queso fresco, crema, serrano, and cilrantro) both were great. I must take my hat off to the Carnitas, it was special my personal favorite and the best I have ever had. I will be back again on my next visit, maybe even twice."}
{"text":"Really good hybrid of Asian Mexican. Sounds weird but it really works. Nice to sit outside on a summer evening. Staff were moderately friendly but not what I'm used to in the US, not that it really mattered."}
{"text":"I'm at a 4.5 on this place. Warning: it's pricy. The menu is unbelievably good. We had the street corn and the papas as a starter which in retrospect was too much. The tacos - I ordered al pastor and my wife ordered carne asada - were out of this world. The old fashioned that subs mezcal for bourbon is a little too smoky but it was a great change of pace."}
{"text":"The newness has worn off, you can get in now. We have a great meal. Always order chips and salsa if you get the queso fundido, the tortillas are not enough! The shrimp tacos were the perfect blend of savory and sweet. The Thai coconut and the jalapeno pineapple margaritas were on point. Avoid the Mezcal mash at all cost. Oh. Em. Gee."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious! It's a very popular place so recommend making a reservation! The inside of the restaurant reminds me of a nice cocktail bar. The kitchen is really unique, it's outside facing the streets and there's a bar seating that faces the kitchen. We sat at the bar spots facing the kitchen so we got to see them prep and plate everything, really cool experience that I've never fine before. As for the food, the tacos were so unique and delicious!! We ordered the regular guac which you can build you own; the regular was really tasty. We also ordered the queso, totally recommend it! The chorizo and peppers with the queso was a great combination. My husband got the al pastor tacos and I ordered the beef tongue then we split the tako tacos (octopus). The beef tongue was amazingly tender that I didn't even realize I was eating tongue.  The octopus was soo good, I could eat that every time! I love seafood so it was right up my alley, the octopus was cooked really well, not chewy and the flavors with the octopus were so delicious! Highly recommend this place at the top of your must try in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Bored of all the usual joints, we decided to try something new. My friends and I head out to täk? on a Friday night. I made a reservation, and that was a good thing as I saw the average waiting time was about 45 minutes.  We ordered the pre-built vegetarian guacamole and it was absolutely delightful. My friends and I loved it so much that we ordered another one. We went on to have some really amazing cocktails, and I particularly liked my Blue Mango Mai Tai!   All of the tacos were incredible, probably the best I have in the recent past. I ordered the pollo asado which was really nice. What was good was, they could replace meat of any combination with mushrooms and make it vegetarian. For instance, my friend got the carnitas taco with mushrooms instead of pork.   Overall, we would definitely go there again. We liked the location too. The only thing which would be better is if they can reduce the volume of the music down a notch."}
{"text":"In terms of food and cocktails, I really enjoy this restaurant.  It's pricey, for sure, but I thought the flavor and quality did not disappoint (unlike Butcher and the Rye, a sister restaurant, which I think I'm the only person in Pittsburgh to not be enamored with).  The waitress was very friendly, and if you like octopus (personally my favorite seafood), the tako taco is out of this world.  Reservations are highly recommended, and sometimes you might find yourself needing to plan a few weeks in advance to get one.  The only reason I wouldn't give a five-star rating is the seating.  If you're a party of two, you'll most likely be seated downstairs at the high-tops.  Not my preference, but typically not a problem.  The issue here is that the seating for the high-tops is just a stool with no back.  I get that it's to maximize space, but it's incredibly uncomfortable.  It was also chilly outside so I had a jacket, and I had to awkwardly ask the waitress if there was anywhere I could put it.  She kindly put it in a locker for me, but when, as a couple, you're dishing out $100+ by the time you have an appetizer, a few rounds of cocktails, tacos, and a tip, you tend to expect to at least be able to relax and enjoy the food a little more."}
{"text":"This upscale Taco and Tequila Restaurant is located in the heart of the Cultural District in downtown Pittsburgh. The daily specials are very unique and crafted for specialty; tacos, appetizers and libations.  The atmosphere is very cool, all customized by the Richard DeSchantz restaurant group. The bike chain chandeliers are so unique you'll never see anything like it anywhere else. The mural on the walls were hand done by a local artist. DJ's play on the weekends and some late nights in the evenings. The outdoor seating during Cooperative weather has a taco bar in front of the kitchen. You can watch the line Cooks make your food right in front of you.  The unique artisan Tequila's are from all over and some of the bottles are very rare and collectors love to gawk over them.   Good for small groups and date nights. You can be as intimate or as social as you like.  I highly recommend getting a few items and sharing.  Once finished here, check out their brotherly restaurant Butcher and the Rye."}
{"text":"Fun and creative. My son had the taco with octopus. Unusual choice and he enjoyed it; it was somewhat sweet and tasty. We had tacos with pork and chicken. Not as brave choices but delicious. You can build your own guacamole too. Don't miss the cocktails."}
{"text":"Tako is the place I'd like to come! Long line but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am a big taco fan. I take any opportunity to try tacos whenever possible. After reading other reviews I had high hopes for this place and it did not disappoint. We started with the street corn, AMAZING. We followed it by the carnitas and bistec tacos, equally amazing. The flavor combinations they put together were works of art."}
{"text":"The margaritas are amazing.  It is a very fun restaurant with good food- just slightly overpriced for what you get, and VERY LOUD.  Do not come here and expect to be able to hear whoever you are dining with"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome place!! The food, cocktails, service, and atmosphere is something everyone must try!!"}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and really enjoyed this place. The cocktails are awesome and the mixologist was charming. Wish I got her name to reference in this post. I pretty much went with her recommendations on both drink (Oaxaco Old Fashion) and tacos (the Korean) and both were on point. The meat of the taco was crispy goodness if that sounds right. If it wasn't for it being a late night on a Wednesday, I would've loved to have a second drink and try something else. It was crowded for 7pm and we got lucky getting the last 2 seats at the bar. Try to plan ahead and get a seat.  Would definitely plan to come back next time I'm in town and try a margarita and more tacos!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was fantastic.  Food was outstanding. Server was a little careless and spilled water on me."}
{"text":"Great vibe.  Great food. Great drinks. Great service.  Reasonable prices for quality received.  Octopus taco was silly good.  Tequila old fashioned was awesome."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype, but it was fun to watch the cooks make the food, and the waiter was nice. I want to give it a 3.5, but it really doesn't deserve a 4 star rating. It's definitely better than average, but täk? did not live up to expectations nor was it exceptionally tasty in general."}
{"text":"We went to Tako for our second time the other night and it was just as impressive as the first. We had the chips and salsa and the Papa Bravas to start. The potatoes were amazing! My husband had the Korean tacos and I had the Carnitas. Would recommend anyone to check this place out. It's legit!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants - sit at the bar or table. Service as terrific as the food. Don't go expecting standard fare tacos- duck and octopus are personal favorites.  And order seviche for starters. Now- the cocktails!  Best mezcal drink I've had!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend on a Saturday night. We didn't have to wait and got to sit on the bar stools looking at the open kitchen. It was a lot of fun watching the guys make everything and it looked like it was all small batch - which is great! We got margaritas (delicious and strong), guac (yummy and plentiful) and split the pork belly tacos. They were absolutely amazing! The slaw served with it went really well with the pork belly. I definitely intend to visit again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Really outstanding cuisine, brilliantly yet simply executed (and I consider myself a Mexican food aficionado).  This resto will not disappoint.  From the build your own guac to the street corn (you must try the street corn), the poke - yummm!!   to the tacos (the \"tako,\" the \"korean,\" and the \"carnitas\").  The specialty cocktails, the service, the food- everything lived up to our expectations.  They even brought two specialty salsas without cilantro.  Went to a few other restaurants during a recent trip to PGH and felt like leaving them to go back to täk?."}
{"text":"Very trendy.  Good food.  Served very quickly.  Almost too quickly.  Very loud.  Very hip.  Definitely recommend reservations."}
{"text":"One thing about reading overly enthusiastic Yelp reviews before going to a place is the risk of having unrealistic expectations. I think this is what happened to us at täk?.  It was a Monday night, we were able to reserve a table for three at 7 pm for 8:30 pm so the reservation was smooth.   I love the ambiance, the kitchen being open in the front. The seating area, the menu, the service they were all stylish and nice.   We ordered the classic guacamole, the chips were salty and delicious, the hot sauce we asked for was almost as good as the guac. Then we ordered the tacos and I went for the chorizo. It was really good and delicious but didn't really blow my mind. My friends ordered cocktails and they weren't thrilled about their drinks. Overall was a pleasant experience though, will definitely go back to try more of the starters and different guacamole. Just keep the expectations realistic."}
{"text":"The first time i went in at 6:30, they told us there wont have a table until 9:30, so we left.  Second time we made a reservation (6:45), a couple walked in and was told there wont be a table till \"ten-fifteen\".  They thought he meant 10~15 minutes, and were corrected, 10:15pm it was.  So you are warned, make reservation. (unless you are on your own, then you can always fight your way to the bar table)  we had the fish taco and the Octopus (Tako) taco.  Honestly i am a bit disappointed.  The tako tasted like chicken than seafood.  I love seafood and have octopus a lot.  This is not bad, just different...  We had a sashimi starter too, it might be a special of the day.  I cannot find it on their online menu.  Well... too bad, cause it was actually pretty good.  At the end of the day, I just do not think the waiting time / reservation time is justified.  I do think it is overrated. and hence, the \"ok\" rating.   This place is too busy to go before seeing a play, too loud for a date, and far too busy for your sudden taco rush.  Certainly worth a try, but i am not a big fan for re-visit."}
{"text":"Amazing! It was a cute little tiny place that we could have easily walked by, but I love tacos and was intrigued. The name didn't sound very authentic, but you could see them making everything behind the counter, plus there were tons of people there. I'm so glad I didn't overlook the place. The fish taco was one of the best I've ever had. The fish was perfectly fried, not overly greasy. The relish and pickled red onions offered a perfect fusion flavor and the tortilla was good too. I also had the street corn, which unfortunately was not good."}
{"text":"First stop when my friends and i drove into Pittsburgh. SO good. Ambience was so cool and the food was top notch. Gourmet tacos at their best! We had the classic guac and I had the pork tacos. Highly recommended! Pretty busy for a Sunday night, but it was worth the 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"Great and very different food in an awesome downtown location. Sat outside and had a great time with our 1 year old. Not sure if that would have worked well inside but it was a great experience for us and the service was tremendous!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Such good food and an awesome dining experience. Make an reservation as it's needed !!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service and delicious food. Loved the combination of flavors!!!  Presentation of the BiG Board was fun!!  The Bravas are to die for!!   Reminded us of the delicious bravas we ate all over Spain!!!"}
{"text":"Reservations were made weeks in advance via Yelp for a Tuesday night dinner. I was bringing in friends from LA, so I was clearly regretting my decision to take them to a taco shop. These were your gourmet tacos, not street tacos, and each taco order comes with 2 tacos- which are pretty huge.  We started with the Guacamole appetizer- you get a order sheet and check-off the mix-ins that you want. Loved the guacamole, and it came with a lot of chips. The Thrice Cooked Wings were also great- the meat just fell off the bone. The fish sauce taste was distinct, so if you don't like it, don't get it. The wings are given by weight when we asked about how many pieces, and this appetizer was enough for 4 people.   I got the Baja Taco- tempura white fish with cabbage, onion, radish and jalapeno relish. First thought- the fish is huge!! I loved the slaw on top of the fish, but overall, not really digging the taco overall. The fish was not as crispy as I would've liked, and it got a little soggy. Friends complimented the Bistec as well."}
{"text":"Trendy and cool atmosphere, but the food is \"just okay\" in my opinion... especially for expensive price. The streak and chicken tacos were good, but the pork was salty as hell, and the salmon was bland. People think since the wait list for a reservation is so long it must be fantastic. It's a trick!"}
{"text":"Service and decor were excellent.  The staff takes the time to go through the menu with you.  I ordered the tako taco and chips and salsa for an appetizer.  Each order comes with two tacos and is more than enough food.  I would highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos & margaritas! I strongly suggest a reservation. We got lucky and snagged 2 seats at the bar on a busy Saturday night. The bartender was friendly and provided us with great service. I will def come back when in town."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful and the food was great. The only probably i had was with our server. I've been a server for 6 years and i never would have treated anybody the way she treated us. Mind you, we are college students and yes typically most don't tip well  but we all said to each other we were going to tip 20% until we were treated like that. Even after her attitude i still tipped 20% because i know how it is. She was nice at first but then when she got more tables of an older crowd she tended more to them and ignored us and every time she walked past she snatched something off of the table, didn't say a word to us just snatched it up. My friends and i looked at each other like wtf? As a server, i treat everyone equally. Although, i may assume people might not tip it doesn't give the right to give lower quality service because it reflects poorly on the restaurant overall. Impressed with the food and drinks but not impressed with service for my first visit i hope that changes"}
{"text":"Really unique tacos...I'm not a calamari person in general so the octopus tacos were a little out of my food comfort zone, but in the same note, I love trying new food. Flavor was great! Amazing atmosphere and the drinks are fabulous"}
{"text":"The tacos in this place are really great! Love the fact they use fresh ingredients and tortillas like in a real Mexican restaurant. So far the best tacos I have had in Pittsburgh. I am Mexican and I have complained there is no good place for tacos in this city,this guys made my night!! The only reason I don't give 5 is because in their location the bathroom is only one, little for a whole restaurant and it is as dark as the restaurant. Personally I don't like black toilets in a black low illuminated space because you can't see if it clean. Also the fact that men and women use same bathroom adds smells to the small WC."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had. The atmosphere is so fantastic and fun, and the food and drinks were amazing. The octopus tacos were some of the best tacos Ive ever had! The servers were gracious, prompt, and helpful, and it was so fun to see the kitchen staff at work.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So good! The queso fondido was amazing and so were the carnitas tacos! Loved the blood orange margarita too!"}
{"text":"Just OK. Visiting from outside of the area, a former (short term) Pittsburgher myself--this place is giving me the impression that the 'burgh just might be getting a tad too big for its britches. Hipsters galore. Bartenders were minimally attentive to those whom they weren't personally acquainted with. Not impressed. Al Pastor taco: mostly tasty. Baja: looked like a Mrs. Paul's frozen fish nugget thing. Mayo was a key player in all dishes sampled."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Anne was great and our drinks were made perfectly. She offered her suggestions on tacos to try and was very personable during our time there. Both the chorizo and Pollo Asado were cooked to perfection. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Gonna get this off my chest first: I don't understand what the ambiance of tako is trying to achieve. We had a party of six for 9PM on Halloween night, and I was ready to have a fun night with good company... but at the risk of sounding 100 years old, I could barely hear a thing thanks to the music blasting in the background. Is this a club or a restaurant? :/  Rant aside, the food is pretty good here. Our chips and classic guac were tasty as expected, but the chicharrons were meh (my Latina friend was unimpressed). The two tacos we each got were decently sized, and the flavor combinations were delicious. Mine had pork, pineapple, and avocado, and I swapped my second taco for a friend's duck confit taco. I would probably be down to try all the taco choices on the menu, to be honest.   I do have to say though, it's kind of weird to have a sit-down dinner wait time for tacos that we all essentially inhaled in a couple minutes. If the atmosphere had been conducive to actual conversation vs. yelling across the table, the waiting would have been more enjoyable at least. For that reason I'd dock a star from my rating."}
{"text":"There were a lot more negatives then positives from start to finish. I won't go on a big rant but once a menu is thrown at you and your date by a bartender things start going downhill pretty fast. Chips and salsa weren't bad but the chips were a little salty. I ordered the tacos names Tako and I almost choked on the off taste of dirty/old cilantro. The Korean tacos also were heavy on the salt, kinda took away from the taste. All in all I hoped it would be a little better seeing how it was $18 for two tacos. Went down the street to a food truck and had great tacos for 2.50.lol"}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD. LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE.   This place is always booked up when I want to go. Makes it even better when I can finally get in for dinner. The guacamole is fantastic and I loved the street corn."}
{"text":"Tacos. It's a need it my life. Finding a good place for tacos isn't easy...Finding a place to replace the hole left in the heart after the closing of Verde? Impossible....until last night!  We went to the Grit and Grace late night Happy Hour for some amazing snacks and drinks and wanted to finish with an amazing meal. I've been dying to get in to Tako. I have seriously been waiting since the day it opened! We walked up at about 10:30 pm and they were able to seat us!   The ambience in this place is sexy and fun. The red lights and the giant cracken in the wall are so damn cool. Even though the tables were super close I had no trouble focusing on the conversation at the table.  There is an upstairs that looked pretty great. I'd like to try that next time.  We ordered the quacamole with the editions of pepita, bacon, pineapple, and charred poblanos. It was perfection. The chips are thin and crispy and salty perfection.  My friend ordered the Duck Confit taco. Damn. Damn. It was so good. I was hoping he'd offer me more. But I took the liberty of sipping on his drink with out permission so...I won. He had the El Diablo. The drink was so good and fresh with ginger beer and lime that I'm dying too go back for the drinks alone! I had the Chicken Asado. It was classic with avacodo and crema. My favorites! It was the best chicken taco I've ever had.   If you plan to visit Tako you have 2 choices.... waaay advanced reservations or a late, late night meal. Either way DO IT!"}
{"text":"Found this great spot yesterday and I'm so glad I did. The place is new and quite popular as a lot of people tried to get in and couldn't because it was that packed. Fortunately for me, I was alone so I sat at the bar located right outside. LOVED that concept. You can also see the kitchen from the sidewalk which I think is a genius idea to attract more customers as the food was not only attractive to look at, it was also delicious. Also, having grown up in Spain, I know I good Sangria when I drink one and thankfully, the Sangria I ordered made me feel like I was back home (not too many time I get to say this). I also ordered the duck confit tacos and they were a hit! I recommend you order them if you like spicy food. However there were two things that were a miss: first, I noticed that the hostess could've maybe...smiled a bit more. Although friendly when we spoke both on the phone and in person, she looked like she didn't want to be there at all. As a customer, this is a bit disappointing since your first experience with a restaurant begins with the host/hostess and seeing her look bored or perhaps annoyed really does not leave a good impression. Also, I ordered a ceviche to start off and I thought it could have had a bit more flavor.   Having all this said, I will surely come back to Tako in the future. The cooks look like they know what they're doing and are constantly supervised, the service was fast and attentive, sangria was phenomenal, and what I believe was the owner is extremely welcoming and professional."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out because I had been to the one at PPG Paints arena. Overall, I wasn't impressed. The food was decent but overpriced. The service was good and everything came out quickly, which was nice.  Guacamole- we ordered the one that had duck confit since I thought it sounded interesting and different than anything that I had in the past. It was just okay, I had expected the duck to be warm but it was cold. The portion was also a bit small for the $18 price tag.  Poke - The poke is served with these popped rice crisps, which led to the execution to be off. When I had one with a rice crisp, it broke and I ended up dropping some poke on the ground. It was good with the corn chips that I had kept from the guacamole.  Tacos - we ordered and shared the bistecca and the mushroom tacos. They were pretty good but pricey.  Drinks - we had the spicy cucumber and pineapple jalapeño.   Overall, the food was good but I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Wow. Great spot for solo traveler to get some serious Mexican grub. Try the sikil pak if you want some authentic mid American dip. Refreshing. The chips are the size of tortillas and delicious. Perfect amount of lime and salt. Tacos come in twos. So app and order of tacos is perfect for one."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Decor and menu very creative. Reviews don't lie about this place. Seeing the masters in the kitchen at work. Priceless. Had the wings with the Korean tacos. I would definitely visit again when I'am in town."}
{"text":"We had dinner here December 30. Were really looking forward to it due to the great reviews and loving mexican food, but found it to be overpriced for mediocre food and cocktails, which were $10 each. By comparison, last year we were in philly and had the most amazing jalapeño infused margheritas that I would gladly pay that price for, but these did not compare.   It was loud and crowded. On the upside, the decor was interesting, staff was all very friendly and accommodating, and food was good - just not worth the pricetag. Also I love spicy food and the hottest salsa and hot sauce was barely above mild"}
{"text":"Although very difficult to get a reservation it is well worth it. Their food is very unique and you won't get the same flavors other places. We got both of the veggie tacos and the guacamole. I liked the avocado taco best, and the mushroom was good too, very Smokey. I It has a cool ambiance on the inside too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Boom. If your looking for a swanky place for off the hook Mexican fare, stop on over. Drinks are rockin along with the tacos. Great guacamole make your own mixture and eclectic tacos that aren't too big. Great spot to chill"}
{"text":"This hidden gem gives you the all the bang for the buck. If you're looking for a nice hearty meal, täk? shouldn't be on your list. While the prices may seem absurd for what you are getting, every penny is worth the food that the kitchen is throwin your way. These tacos are divine and there is no other way to describe it. Each order of tacos comes with two with the exception of the täk? big board (6 pairs of tacos). Oh, I wouldn't take your kids here; kinda resembles a hipster strip club."}
{"text":"Tako is wonderful!  From the friendly attentive wait staff the extremely fresh and unique dishes this place is on my list of top before theater restaurants!"}
{"text":"How to start... this place was garbage. The service was subpar and the food was at best mediocre. Definitely not worth the price!! I understand that this place is supposed to be fusion food but the quality was just not good at all.  When we arrived my girlfriend and I stopped at the bar. I had the mezcal margarita and she had the wine frozen margarita. About 10 minutes later, we were sat at a table. It took about 15 minutes before our server got to the table. When he got there you could tell he really didn't want to serve us. So we made it easy for him and order everything right off the bat. We got the queso fundido, tako and korean. The queso fundido stuck to the roof of your mouth and not in a pleasant way. The tako tasted fishy as if the octopus was old and the Korean was ok but nothing to write home about. The worst part was that during the whole meal the music was so loud it was almost impossible to have a conversation.  Overall, my advice is if you are looking for good Mexican fusion food that won't leave you poor, I recommend trying Bakersfield Penn Ave. Much better food and drinks and much more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The reviews here are soooo good that I hyped myself up for some amazing tacos and margs. I don't know if it was an off night or if I'm just a sucky person, but my dining experience was just okay.   + creative cocktails  + reasonable prices + interesting guacamole combinations + chips and tortillas on point  + michelle was an awesome server!   - long wait after 9 p.m. on a Wednesday... dang!  - front of house texting system does not work - inquired after 40 minutes of waiting and were told tables had been open... say what!? Fail.  - LOUD... terrible acoustics  - cougar den took over the bar area - tacos were a major letdown :( - flavorless meat... HOW!? - toppings lacked seasoning... HOW x 2!?"}
{"text":"This is the only place in ANY city that has been so good that I came back the very next night and ate here again. When you walk in and they are making fresh tortillas right in front of you - you know it's a good sign.   Tako is an trendy Mexican joint that offers the essentials. Although I wouldn't call this \"traditional mexican\" they take street food and elevate it. What makes this place different is the quality. Their tacos are rather large so I would suggest splitting for the table. I don't think they let you sub orders of two. The chorizo was our favorite of them all, but the real star of the night was the queso.   My GAWD I would give my left arm for just a bite of this queso right now. It's very thick with chorizo and spicy peppers. But here's what's amazing, as if you didn't already feel disgusting enough eating a vat of cheese, they give you a BAG of fresh tortillas to rip apart and dunk into the cheese. No chips, just warm fresh tortillas. I quit counting calories after my first bite and let myself go to enjoy what is probably (still) one of my favorite appetizers in the country. And I know what you're thinking...how can queso be this good? And I'm with you. I'm not one to even order it - but our friends as the table did and we got out own order, and came back the next night to have it again. And friends, I'm no afraid to admit that. We're in a safe place here and I feel you have the right to know.   Aside from the REDONKULOUS food. The atmosphere is super cool. Dim lit with a cantina/nightclub vibe. Beautiful art and lanterns light up the space. Perfect for a girls night out or date night.   Highly recommend and super jealous that we don't have one in Cincinnati. If you're in Pittsburgh or ever have any desire to go - bookmark this now or forever live in FOMO."}
{"text":"My last night in Pittsburgh for work and I had to end the trip with an awesome dinner with an old high school friend. I was perusing Yelp, spouting out names and I came across this place. My friend said, \"Dude, if you can get us a reservation at täk? THAT'S where we're going\". He must not know who I am. (Puts sunglasses on.) Needless to say, I got us a reservation after failing to online, but by calling and we went. First of all, the kitchen is at the FRONT of the restaurant because you can actually sit at a stool right outside and order food directly from the kitchen. Legit. Inside the atmosphere is almost.. \"goth-like\". its very dark, red lighting everywhere, decorative \"splatter\" on the walls, but it was certainly unique. It wasn't too packed so we were sat downstairs. The staff was very friendly, flirty and helpful to me being a first-timer. Their menus were like... newspapers which I thought was pretty cool. I had already been drinking and was feelin' spend-y (bad idea) so I started with drinks! I began with their Thai Coconut margarita which was sweet and delicious. It didn't taste very strong, but take note of that. For an appetizer we got the Thrice Cooked Wings which are covered in a caramel fish sauce all over pickled carrots, cucumber, mint chili seasoning and cilantro. I know that sounds like a wild combination, but DON'T KNOCK IT. Some of THE BEST fall-off-the-bone, like, how-did-you-make-them-taste-this-good wings I've ever had. They were hot, spicy, sweet, savory... I can't use enough adjectives. JUST KNOW, they were that good. I made the mistake of eating the chili peppers... more than twice so my mouth was on fire. For our entrees we got 6 tacos and split them so we could have 1 each of 3 different kinds. The tacos come in pairs. Seemingly expensive, but ultimately worth it. We went for the Chorizo, Carnitas and the Bistec. The Chroizo comes with carmelized onions, roasted poblano, romesco, gently fried egg, queso fresco, arbol hot sauce and cilantro. We received an anonymous tip from a table next to us to flip the egg upside down so that when you bite into the taco the egg yolk runs into the taco. OMG. Mind blown. AMAZING. I'm not even going to try describing the flavor to you. Just get it. Next was the Carnitas which comes with braised pork butt, guacamole, salsa verde, chicharrones and cilantro. Again, very good. Not as good as the Chorizo, but I have NO complaints. Lastly, the Bistec comes with wagyu skirt steak, salsa roja, gem lettuce, queso fresco, fried shishito and of course cilantro. This was my favorite of the 3. It just blew me away. The flavor combinations that the chefs were able to concoct just blow my mind. For my 2nd drink I had the Watermelon Basil margarita which was very tasty, but again, weak. I will absolutely return here to try the rest of the menu. I was extremely impressed with the food, just not with the drinks. No matter, it'll save me more money and room in my stomach for my tacos by not getting drinks."}
{"text":"Great service (Dave), nice salad, reasonable prices, chill atmosphere, and good drinks. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Everything was extremely delicious, including the cocktails. Service was excellent as well. The poke bowl and Korean short ribs taco were our two favorites."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the hype (and the three week wait for a weekend reservation!). Would be a five star review, but for the service. Our waitress was very nice, but she clearly had too many tables (odd because the place is so small). It also took forever to get our first round of drinks and it looked like they only had one bartender working.   We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time and we were promptly seated. We didn't expect that, but we were pleasantly surprised!  We started with the chips and salsa and the queso fundido. Great portions on both of these. We had three salsas and all were absolutely delicious. We also ordered the pineapple jalapeño margarita and the grapefruit sage margarita.  We were impressed by the size of the entree tacos. The shells were packed full of protein and add ins. We ordered the bistec tacos and the fried chicken tacos. The fried chicken was on the specials list and it was underwhelming. However, the bistec was excellent. The meat was seasoned to perfection and cooked just to the right temperature. Would definitely order those again.   For a second round of drinks, we ordered the watermelon margarita and the mezcal smash. Unless you'd had mezcal before and really enjoy the unique flavor, I would NOT recommend this cocktail. It had a terrible aftertaste (but that might just be the typical taste of mezcal). The pineapple jalapeño margarita was definitely the best cocktail of the evening hands down.   As for the ambience, it was small, crowded, dimly lit, and loud. Probably not the best location for a first date. However, we enjoyed the atmosphere and DJ was throwing down some awesome old school tunes.   We found the prices pretty reasonable for the portion sizes. I'm confident we'll return in the future to explore more of the unique taco and cocktail pairings."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me so long to get to Tako! It was amazing! I would definitely recommend making a reservation. On a Thursday night the place was packed even the bar!   The decor was cool and they had a DJ who was awesome!  Ordered the Brisket Queso Fundido and wings as starters. The Queso came with warm tortillas. So good! And the wings were equally as good! The wings also come with a warm wet towel for easy clean up! Ordered the Pollo Asada (chicken)  and Bistec (steak)  tacos. The pollo Asada was great but I didn't care for the Bistec. Make sure you save room for the funnel cake! It was amazing!!!   I will be going back soon  and often!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants in Pittsburgh that I've been to. Had really high expectation for this place but everything was just overpriced and got charged for extra chips when the queso didn't even come with chips. The waiter was also not attentive. Dont be fooled by all the good reviews!"}
{"text":"Pollo asado and bistec had amazing flavors. You can tell they are using quality ingredients. I want to go back and try them all. The whipped cheesecake dessert was also incredible."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I've ever had! The portions appear small, but the plates are very filling. I loved both the chicken and fish tacos they offered. I cannot wait to try the other varieties! The atmosphere is unmatched and I love the music selections/ decor."}
{"text":"I've never been so please with food in my life, I had an order of the chicken and an order of the steak tacos. I was expecting them to look and taste great, but what I got was so much more. I just looked at these tacos and they looked like art. They were beautifully designed. The colours and flavours all blended in to make each bite taste better than the last. Both orders were amazing. I also had a margarita which was crafted and mixed perfectly. I can not wait to return."}
{"text":"I am torn between three and four stars.  I want to give them six stars for the superb food, but the service is extremely lacking.    My husband and I have been to Tako twice.  The first time was an utter disaster with our appetizer forgotten, and ordered more takos to make up for it at the end.  My husband and our table were sprayed with water coming from the soda gun at the bar.  Our waiter was only concerned about the cute girls beside us.  We were practically ignored. The manager finally came over when we said don't bring us more takos just let us leave.  The manager was completely appropriate and gave us our meal with tacos to go.  It was quiet a while before we tried it again.  It wasn't as bad as the first visit, but still sub-par service. The second round, after being there for thirty minutes I couldn't get my waitress's attention to ask for more water.  She did not make eye contact with me.  Even when I am walking in and out of the restaurant, the staff does not even stop to let me through as they must be more important than I am.  I just do not understand this mentality.   However..... the tacos are so freaking good.  The Tako taco is so delicious with the most perfectly cooked octopus I have ever eaten (not chewy, which is so hard to do)! The octopus is complemented with delicious lemon vinegarette and crispy chickpeas, OMG!!! Cannot get enough.  The other tacos we had were also delicious including lamb barbacoa and duck.  So good!! Plus the guacamole: chorizo and goat cheese.  We almost licked the bowl.     YUM YUM YUM!  But I will probably get take-out takos from here on out.  Delicious food without the subpar hipster we are too good for you servers."}
{"text":"Food four stars, service four stars, atmosphere two stars if you like to be able to hear your companion and not have ice-cold A/C shooting down on your head. It's cute, it's funky, but it's more like a nightclub that happens to serve great tacos - if that's your thing, then you will love it!  Tako taco - excellent. Same with duck confit taco. Smoked salmon guac not great. Cocktails spectacular.  Our server would have been a five star but something we ordered never came even tho we asked for it twice - it arrived after we asked for the check."}
{"text":"Good tacos, but over priced.  Not over priced for Pittsburgh tacos mostly.  Outside of Edgar's taco stand (reasonable prices and good tacos), these are better than any other Pittsburgh taco.  But 14 beans for two tacos...only in the Pitt can you getaway with this."}
{"text":"We stopped in for late night tacos tonight at 12:05. Sat at the outside counter for fifteen minutes without being acknowledged. There were plenty of people in the kitchen putting tops on containers and such. Specifically, there was a chef in a blue and gray shirt that looked at us three times while working an arms length away and didn't acknowledge us once. Finally, we went inside to ask for service and was told late night service wouldn't start for another 30 minutes. I expect more from a Richard D restaurant. Very disappointing. I hope others don't have the same experience."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place and told me it is hard to get a reservation but I was traveling solo so I just snagged a spot at the bar right when it opened.  For me it is too dark inside, I don't like that look.  I ordered the tako tacos and the wings.  The wings were caramelized fish sauce, bomb!  It had pickled vegetables which provided a nice balance for the wings that had a little kick to it.  The fried skin on it was amazing.  The tako tacos I was told by the bartender is a favorite, it did not let me down.  First off, the tortilla was amazing! I would think all the tacos were good because I know it comes on that tortilla.  The tako itself, very good.  Lightly floured and fried.  This was $22 so I don't know if I would spend that myself (I was traveling for work) but I would definitely suggest any of those other tacos because like I said, that tortilla was amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively phenomenal.  The food is out of of this world good, there's an excellent drink selection, and the staff is very friendly.  Go on a Sunday night, though, it's WAY less crowded."}
{"text":"täk? is considered to be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and it's for a reason. Both times I've eaten there it has exceeded my expectations.  täk? is an upscale eatery in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh that brings SoCal Mexican food with deluxe ingredients. They have fantastic cocktails, a great venue, and unique tacos.  The drinks: täk? has a great selection of margaritas that pair perfectly with their tacos and appetizers like Queso Fundido (a creamy queso made with shishito, chorizo, scallions, cilantro). I recommend the Oaxaca  and Grapefruit margaritas, although the Classic is solid as well.  Both their guac and Queso Fundido are great starters, but the focal point of the menu are their selection of tacos. Ranging from their tangy Korean Short Rib to the savory Chorizo to their legendary Octopus. They have a variety of tacos that all seem to hit the mark with fresh flavors and unique ingredients that add new twists on classic tacos. The standout is the obviously unique octopus taco. It delivers meaty but tender grilled octopus with small accoutrements that bring out the delicious flavor of the octopus. It's a must get if you visit.  All in all the perfect place to spend a Friday evening. Try to get a spot at the small outside bar. You sit next to the kitchen and get to watch the whole process, definitely a great atmosphere. It's not cheap, but it's not ridiculously priced either and for the food you get it's worth every penny  TLDR: Delicious upscale taco place in the middle of downtown. Grab a Oaxaca margarita if you like mezcal, if not go for the grapefruit. Tacos are the focus, they're all tasty but at least get the octopus as it's in a class of its own."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side, but you can leave spending less than 40 dollars for two tacos', some guac and chips, and a drink.  Btw the tacos are amazing, the Korean taco, my lord, fantastic.  Also this place is loud, so if you want a quieter setting ask to be seated upstairs."}
{"text":"I had bravo lava for starter. You never go wrong with fried potato yum! Korean and soft shell crab tacos are very good. I like the Asian fusion sauce flavor and the texture of taco shells. Just for us, the korean bbq sauce might be a bit salty. But overall, really like this place and finally got a chance to come!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, a little loud for a group of people to hear ine another. Spicy sucumber margarita was delicious!"}
{"text":"TAKO is awesome and  beyond! The open kitchen, the extremely fresh food, the management and waitstaff went above my expectations! We tried a little of everything...salsas, guacamole, queso....wow! The carnitas taco was bursting with fresh meaty flavor. Definitely will return and return ....and return!"}
{"text":"We had a great time.  Cool atmosphere and food was delish!"}
{"text":"Phenom ultra swank establishment with red mood lighting and the zhush of city nightlife and sexiness. The food, the atmosphere, the music, the cocktails, the service...it all will give you the craving to return.   I ordered the poke, duck tacos and spicy cucumber cocktail. Fresh 2 death. High grade ingredients and piled high fresh herbs. The craving is real. Highly recommended to get yourself some reservations and spend some of your money there."}
{"text":"Everything here was so good! Great food, great service and great space! It was easy to get in and out of too.  Will definitely be back :) try the watermelon basil magarita , the street  and papas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Crowded, but that's a good sign, right? Right! Great tacos and so sudden two really are enough, especially if you have one of the great appetizers such as ceviche"}
{"text":"AMAZINGNESS!!!  My husband and I ate here last Friday.  It was opening week, so they weren't taking reservations but we showed up at opening (5 pm) and got a table no problem.  The cocktails were the best part--they are all unique and many have mezcal (a smoky tequila, YUM!), which is a rare find in PGH.  We split chips and salsa, and each got an order of tacos.  I got the baja tacos (tempura fish) and my husband got the Korean tacos.  Everything was really good.  None of the salsas were too spicy, but they have homemade hot sauce they will bring out to you also, which has a kick.  Everything is made fresh and so delicious!  If I could say anything bad (and I really can't), they aren't many veggie options--there was a mushroom taco, but it had huitlacoche (corn fungus) as part of the plate and I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous. :)  We also shared the tres leches pie for dessert.  It was good--not my favorite dessert ever, but definitely delicious, and the desserts are big enough for two.  I love the decor--nautical meets street art meets gothic cathedral?  It's gorgeous.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Love tako!!!"}
{"text":"Truly superb tacos, guac (build your own) and Margaritas -- possibly the best I've ever had in all three categories. Even the house-made tortilla chips were extra crunchy & flavorful, without being at all greasy. The vibe here is very hip, and the service is attentive and helpful. Even the bathroom is cool.  I found myself at tako two nights in a row, and although I was warned that it would be very crowded, the turnover at the inside bar was fast enough that I only waited maybe ten minutes to get a seat. That's entirely reasonable IMHO. I tried the steak tacos (Bistec) and the grilled chicken/avocado tacos on the two successive nights. I suppose if I was super picky I might have said the beef was a bit too rare for my tastes (they don't ask you about cooking temp), but the flavor was amazing. I actually liked the chicken even better. This place knows how to inject a lot of meaty flavor into their grilled items. This is one thing that makes the tacos truly exceptional. Background music is downtempo, hip, EDM genre, which seems to fit with the decor and the clientele quite well. This is the best food I have eaten in Pittsburgh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were able to walk in and get seats at the bar on a Thursday night, so that's one way to get around the long lead time needed for reservations. I expected it to be good, but it really blew my mind. The street corn appetizer was fantastic, thankfully we had chips to scrap up any sauce or cheese that didn't make it onto the corn. And the Tako Tacos were incredible. Best octopus I've ever had, just a completely different texture from calamari or even high quality grilled octopus. I told the bartender I was angry at every other octopus I've ever had for being so bad in comparison. The care and effort they put into everything from the tortillas to the ailois to the octopus was really evident. 5 stars. Now if I could just get a table, I'd go back all the time..."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We had tried to make weekend reservations to Täko a couple of times before with no luck.  The attempts were made a couple weeks in advance and while there were times available, they always seemed to be after 9 pm. As a matter of a fact I found the whole calling this place for reservations to be silly as the person on the other end always seemed to be next to a DJ booth.  So while I was in a perfectly quiet environment I was forced to scream to be heard.  Why can't they just use some sort of online system?  I digress though and so my wife and I found ourselves outside of Täko at 5 PM as it was opening.  Thankfully we were the last party able to secure a non reservation table and we were led upstairs to the farthest table against the wall.  So while I walked through the whole restaurant I don't know that I saw as much as I should have.  On your way in you can see the kitchen and there are actually a couple of seats outside the restaurant on the sidewalk that act as a \"chefs table\".  They also have some crazy colored bathrooms which I didn't use and then each table seemed to have an odd religious candle on it.  For dinner my wife and I decided to split the poke for our appetizer which was big eye tuna, seaweed and rice crackers that came with what I thought was a lime crema. I can't say that it was really what I expected as it felt like a play on ceviche.  The tuna was raw but I really enjoyed it whenever I dipped it into the slightly tart lime sauce.  Then for our dinners I went with the duck confit tacos while my wife went with the Täko tacos. My tacos came with the duck, cucumber, scallions, pickled peppers, hoisin, cilantro and mint while my wife's consisted of grilled octopus, Harissa aioli, lemons and pickled red onion.  She enjoyed hers immensely and told me that she could eat a whole plate of the grilled octopus that was inside.  My tacos were also pretty good and I loved all the accompaniments to them but I have definitely had better duck confit before.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  I look forward to trying more of their delicious tacos and hopefully the next time I am able to procure a reservation."}
{"text":"Finally got a reservation that worked for Tako' on the unseasonably warm February day.  Got a fish taco that was to die for, 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is super trendy/hip, without the arrogance or standoff attitude of most hip places.  Be aware though: This place is super super small, you are basically sitting with your neighbor, very loud music and dark like a club. I think its awesome, but it is certainly something you need to be in the mood for. Don't go there if you are just looking to relax, it def has an upbeat vibe.  The service was great! Although it was tiny the manager was able to accommodate our request to sit outside away from the crowd (reservations aren't taken for outside) due to my bf's medical problems. They were super nice and the wait wasn't too long. Service was great through the entire meal. I especially like that everyone was \"hip\" but very nice and down to earth. The drinks were AMAZING. Seriously two of the best cocktails I have every had..high alcohol content (I watched bartender make it), yet it tasted great and not like alcohol too strong. Two margaritas and I had a great buzz going. I recommend the passion fruit margarita, so yummy, and pretty! The spicy cucumber margarita was great too, could actually taste the heat.  The food....this place is definitely all about the drinks/vibe, which is fine. The food was really good though, but not the best tacos I have had or anything...they are not \"Mexican\" style in case that is what you are looking for...rather they are very \"clean\" and simple tacos, lots of good options, the pork and pineapple was great!! Lots of fun apps to share, the street corn was really nice.  I def want to go back to try some more margaritas! Loved the place! They really have something good going on....MUST have a reservation though or you are not getting in."}
{"text":"Perfect, the food here absolutely delivers, 5 star. Octopus taco was delicious, as well as short rib taco. Octopus was tender and flavorful, perfectly cooked. The flavors on the tacos work perfectly together, well engineered dishes. Guacamole was absolutely fantastic as well. Drinks, again, amazing. Spicy margarita was my favorite, wow - and all drinks are only $10?! This place is incredible value, but then again maybe I am used to other big cities, but you cannot complain about price here for the quality of food you are receiving. Great ambiance and decor, the concept was executed flawlessly - props to the owner on a job well done. Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Food and service are always exceptional.   Place is a bit on the dark side and you are right on top of the table next to you.  Can also be abbot loud later in the evening.    I like the variety of tacos and my son loves all of them.  This is another place very much on the try and get there list when we visit.  I have also got tacos to go and they hold up just as well."}
{"text":"Garbage, trendy spot to make the easily bored feel relevant. Putting cilantro on a taco doesn't make it gourmet."}
{"text":"This place. This place right here. Wow.   We were down the street at Olive or Twist having drinks trying to think where to go for dinner and we decided to check out Tako. We called to see if they had any reservations for when they opened at 5pm and we were informed that everything was booked until 11pm but we could come in and try to sit at the bar.   We got there at 5:03 PM and almost every seat was already taken. Luckily we got there 3 minutes after they opened as opposed to 7 minutes after we wouldn't have found an open seat for quite some time had we done that.   I was excited to see poke on the menu. That's a dish that's very difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I've honestly never seen that available here. It met my expectations and then some. We also had the chips and salsa. It was nice to see a place serving more than just one basic salsa with their chips. They gave us three different salsas and they all tasted great.   The service from everyone was awesome. This is my new favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. It completely lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like tako it has a slick cool interior with cool street art, chain link fences and a good dj. However the food was just average. The chorizo tacos had a good rub but thats where the flavor ended. The Bisteak was well seasoned and tender and the meal that saved my dinner from being mediocre. My girlfriend really enjoyed the poke but it wasn't for me. I'ld only come back for the $2 late night taco's."}
{"text":"I dined here around Christmas with my friend while I was in town.  I will say Pittsburgh dining has come a long way since I lived there!  I really enjoyed tako.  Cocktails are heavily centered around tequila, which is to be expected as it is a taqueria, and were delicious.  I tried the mezcal version of the Old Fashioned and was pleasantly surprised.   We started with the guacamole with blue cheese and duck confit, and then split a few orders of tacos: Korean, Pollo & Al Pastor.  Everything was really tasty and was reminiscent of my favorite taco joint in Chicago (shout out to Big Star!) so I was impressed.  Service was friendly and the space was done really well.  I think it caters to bigger parties as if you go with only 2 people, you are seated at a high top near the bar.  My only gripe is that I thought it was a bit expensive.  Our guacamole was good and had expensive ingredients, however it cost $18, and tacos are about $7 each so I thought it was a lot."}
{"text":"Incredible service. Incredible food. Incredibly DARK inside. Seriously, they need a few more bulbs. I had the Pork Belly tacos and my wife had the Chicken. Both exceeded every expectation."}
{"text":"I could have SWORN I already wrote a review for tako after I dined here this summer.  Perhaps I enjoyed it so much that I only wrote the review in my mind and never magically posted it to Yelp.  Since I'm getting older and my memory isn't as sharp as it was I can't give a detailed review.  I will say this - what a cool place and a win for Pittsburgh.  Located in the heart of the cultural district tako is a seriously hot spot that you must try.  But do your best to get a reservation because this place is busy all. the. time.  I like that the kitchen sits facing the street and is open for all to see the magic happening on the grill.  There is also limited outdoor, sidewalk seating, but also a few bar stools facing the kitchen.  Tres cool.  This restaurant is pretty small and if I had to guess has 30 tables total.  There are two floors for seating and if you're upstairs it is kind of like a loft and you can look to the tables on the first floor.  I mentioned earlier in this review that I'm not the young whipper snapper I once was and my next comment supports that statement.  It is dark in here.  So much so that my friends and I used the flashlights on our iPhones to read the menu.  Yeah, we're pretty lame.  But not so lame that we were at one of the coolest restaurants in town.  Awesome selection of tacos, including duck confit (pronounced con-feet).  My friends joked with me on my lame pronunciation so I'll help the other yinzers out with the phonetics.    I'll be back and when I do I'll update my review and focus on the food."}
{"text":"Went to Pittsburg for a few days and thought to check this place out. Love the atmosphere, dark and gloomy very intimate during the night. Ordered the Korean and I could only  finish one because it was too salty to my liking. Ordered a non spicy michelada, but that drink came back like they poured the whole Tabasco bottle sauce in it. I wish I had more days in Pittsburgh because I would've tried the other tacos they have to offer. But my first experience was forgettable."}
{"text":"Not vegetarian friendly.  Asked the waiter to see if they would modify ones that look good to us.  Came back with a strict no.  Understand chef's take pride in their work, but people got to eat.  Guess I could have gotten up and left but when you are with a family with kids makes it even harder.  For families with kids that may ask for special needs to be consider, stay away.  Expensive outing that left us hungry."}
{"text":"Oh my. While walking towards täk?, I worried that my expectations were set too high and that I would be disappointed. However, we had a simply magical experience, and I can see why finding a 7:00pm Saturday night invitation - even three months out - is still nearly impossible!  This place is about as hip and trendy and eclectic as a restaurant can get. Though I'm sure sitting outside is very nice in the summer, the interior is where it's at - dim lighting, pulsing music, wall murals, and quirky details abound. The music cranked up a few notches around 8 or 9pm when a DJ arrived, playing beats that my electroNOW Spotify playlist-loving self hadn't even heard before.  I thought that seating might feel a bit tight, but we were ushered to the second floor to large wooden bench style seats with plenty of room to spread out - and more importantly - to spread our food out.  I started with a cocktail from the specials list - a frozen blueberry margarita that our server mentioned being really delicious. Though sweet, it had a nice balance of flavors and was the perfect drink to end a hot summer day. I should have ordered another drink or two but was distracted talking with our friends that I never made up my mind on a second drink. In retrospect, the Strawberry Yuzu margarita on the menu looks absolutely heavenly...  For our appetizers, we picked out a guacamole from the long list and also ordered the Queso Fundido. I don't remember the exact guacamole that we ordered - unfortunately the listing isn't available online - but I know that it was a chef's special and included blue cheese and bacon. Now, I'm not a guacamole lover, the avocado texture grosses me out at times, but this stuff was a.ma.zing. However, even though I loved the guac, I quickly moved on to the queso when it arrived. I often judge a Mexican restaurant based on their queso, and this may be the best queso that I've had in my entire 30 years of life. The cheese was rich, thick, and gooey, the perfect mild white Mexican-style cheese. Typically, I like my queso relatively simple, paired with just some chips, but the dish was so well balanced and executed that I enjoyed the accompanying chorizo, peppers, and tortillas. I wrapped up the cheesy, meaty, peppery goodness into a tortilla and simply transcended into Mexican food paradise.  After such a heavenly queso experience, I didn't know if the tacos would impress, but of course, täk? delivered once again. The hubby and I ordered a special pork belly taco, the Al Pastor, and the Chorizo. All three were simply delicious with very clear, distinctive, well-executed flavors. I enjoyed the light, summery flavors of the Al Pastor, pork shoulder paired with pineapple and cilantro. Each Chorizo taco was covered in carmelized onions and topped with a runny fried egg, which is one of my favorite things to eat. The Mexican food paradise just kept going.  Unfortunately, I re-entered food reality with dessert. I had high expectations as täk?'s sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye has always delivered very strongly here. My friend ordered what I understood to be cheesecake with berries, but it tasted and looked more like cheesecake pudding - descent, but by no means exciting or innovative. My husband and I ordered the churros and were a bit disappointed. The churro itself was bland and boring and the lack of chocolate dipping sauce was upsetting. We used some of our friend's cheesecake \"dip\" for our churros, but the dish was in desperate need of some chocolate and some salt.  Though I wish that I had ordered more tacos instead of trying dessert, I still had an absolutely incredible time and was highly impressed by the atmosphere, the decor, the service, and the food. This restaurant has officially landed itself in my Pittsburgh top 3, along with sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye and new(er) Spanish restaurant Morcilla. I am already looking to make reservations for when friends visit in October!"}
{"text":"The bartenders and service was amazing! Drinks were great, however, the food was just ok. I like trying new things so I had the octopus taco, and my boyfriend had the chicken taco. There was not much flavor to either one. The guacamole was AMAZING! We would come back for drinks and guacamole, probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give more than 5 stars on yelp?  If so, I'd do so for täk?. They were more than accommodating with needing to change reservations because we were coming in from out of town. As for the food...best. taco. ever. At least the pollo is. Haven't tried anything else because the pollo was so good!  Plan ahead and get seats. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Ate here only as it was close to Fairmont where I was staying.  Food was okay, but service was just plain terrible.  Took 20 minutes for drink order to arrive, which came after appetizers, and main courses for 3 diners arrived at separate times, 10 minute apart.  Very inattentive wait staff, and slow bartender/kitchen.  It seemed crowded (place is tiny), but that would not excuse the service.  Also, each person's margarita was mostly all ice.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Really good taco spot but not quite 5 stars. Everything was good but not amazing. Loved the spicy cucumber margarita and the staff was great too."}
{"text":"creativity meets tacos and asia  The Big Board - a must when you visit , let the staff assort the selection -- kinda Taco roulette    Caso is good -- the chip basket (box) size is a tad small - better get two boxes as the staff gets busy and you out of chips   fun for dinner and drinks - the ambient noise makes for an energetic night -- but tough on conversations"}
{"text":"Tako is easily my fav Mexican restaurant in the Burgh. Drinks are creative, music is great, decor is excellent, and the food is Bomb!!! Perfect spot for a date night or a dinner with friends.  Just make sure that you reserve a table in advance if you plan on dining here during peak hours on the weekend."}
{"text":"6 tacos for $75? They're crazy!!! They better add more if they want me to pay $75. Try like 12-15 tacos. Stop trying to rip people off! I've had their corn before and that was good. Their drinks are the bomb as well. Small space and kind of loud, but I like the fact that you can see the kitchen while you're standing in line waiting to be seated. It's always good to see what's going on in the kitchen. I give them three stars because there is no way I'm paying $75 for 6 tacos. I'm not cheap, but 6 is not enough for me for that price. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Best taco ever. Papaya bravas are really good. Well all their tacos are good . Drink wise I had pineapple jalapeño drink. Was really good.  This was my 5th time here and loved it ."}
{"text":"I stopped here since I work nearby and I had heard they just started opening during lunch. The tacos are $5 each - this is pushing it for individual tacos, but it was worth the wait and it's pretty apparent that they use quality ingredients. Fusion is inherently sketchy, but these could potentially be the best sesame chicken tacos with fried rice and perfectly julienned carrots in Pittsburgh (who knows). The outdoor seating is also nice, and it's pretty easy to get take out if you're heading back to the office. Will definitely try this out again!"}
{"text":"So many taco places! So many up scale, Low key and homestyle locations to choose from! What a time to be alive and in Pittsburgh! We went to Tako for restaurant week recently and my knees are weak thinking about it!  Like Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye, The decor of Tako is nothing short of interesting (you should see the bathroom)! The staff is great and the food is killer! We ordered some delicious guacamole that had crab in at, along with a restaurant week special, short rib queso fondue. The fondue was tasty but I definitely preferred the guac! I want to go back and try every combination of ingredients they have!   For my entree, I ordered the Korean tacos. Now, I am a jerk. I have a pet peeve about portions. While I want to get my money's worth, I hate huge portions because I fear that I will either overeat or waste leftovers. These tacos are gigantic! They are basically an entire meal resting on top of a tortilla. However, these tacos were way too amazing to be upset! A mountain of crispy wagyu short ribs with peanuts, fermented cucumbers, cilantro and cabbage came together so deliciously that I have craved these tacos everyday since I ate them a month ago! Bonus? They were $14 for two! If you go to Smoke, a wagyu taco will set you back almost $10 for one and it would certainly not be as satisfying! If I had only ordered the tacos I would have been as equally satisfied.   I go to Butcher a lot for happy hour but I think I need to start switching it up and going next door every once and a while. I think my wallet and belly will thank me!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Tako the first time on my walk to work in the morning from the T station. I would see the guys working in their kitchen, prepping for the day with sliding door open, and 90s music blasting from their work station. I would wave to the guys and receive a welcome response in return. I always thought this was interesting because I tried to get lunch here one day and to my surprise they don't open until dinner, even though they began prep so early. Even so, I knew this was something special that I wanted to try.  My true introduction started on a weekend evening. This place looks like a hole in the wall at first glance, but it's really an upscale fusion restaurant. Be forewarned that this one of the hottest upscale bars/restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh right now. Crowds and a long wait should be expected.  The main seating area has a festive vibe that makes it a great group place, as well as date nights out. The drink selection is insane and full of life, with everyone imbibing.  The tacos and pairings were delicious, fresh, and well done...all two bites of them. All-in-all, the food is delicious and interesting, but be prepared to pay for it!"}
{"text":"Okay, so while the food is freaking fantastic, they need better guidance or better directions on how to get people to use the bar space which is in front of the open kitchen. There were 5 seats available and a note that said to see the host - but I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the host was located. So I finally interrupted one of the chefs and was told to go inside. once inside, host station was easy to find, and I got led outside. Then I waited, and finally interrupted the chef nearest my seat if I gave him my order. Nope, a server would come!  Admittedly when my server came, he was awesome, but its confusion and I found myself explaining the process to the new folks who joined me at the bar. I'm still giving them a 5 star tho' because the food and service were so superior, the initial confusion of how my dining experience started is a quibble.  So on to my menu selections - I got a Red Sangria ($8) which had Brandy, Orange and citrus, based on servers recommendation that it drank smoother. Gosh, this was stronger than I expected - the brandy packed a punch, but super delicious.  - For my first taco, I had to try their namesake so got octopus, harissa aioli, preserved lemons, mizuna greens and herbs plus pickled red onion. The octopus pieces were super generous ad incredibly tender. This was a delight to eat from the 1st bite to the last. Well worth the price tag!  - My next taco was the duck confit - hoisin, scallions, cucumbers, pickled peppers, mint and cilantro. One disadvantage of sitting at the bar is that your eyes feel bigger than your stomach - I saw the chef prepping the duck leg, and it looked so lovely with that dark rich red flesh, I knew I wanted to taste some. One caveat, if you are a wuss with chilies like me, get the pickled peppers on the side - those suckers were massively hot! Another winner on the menu.  - Dessert was Tres Leches to go, lovely rich peaches & creama! Fantastic heavenly smell and each bite was deliciously awesome. I'd get this again!  So, each taco comes x2, and you cant substitute/ mix or match and I ended up taking one of the duck confit tacos back to the hotel - it held up to the next day eating standard, as did the Tres Leches.  One other thing - these guys make the soft tacos in house! With the bar being in front of the open kitchen, I realized one chef's station was set up where he was breaking off pieces of dough, putting it into a taco maker machine and then cooking it! So everything was super freshly cooked and made!!  Lucky Pittsburgh, to have such a fantastic and awesome place to go eat at. Highly recommend and will absolutely return when am next back in Pittsburgh!  Note: #331 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday with another chef friend of mine. Ordered some steak tacos, was impressed with the flavor combination of the tacos. However the steak wasn't cut right and was incredibly chewy. Paid 6 dollars for a bottle of beer from Singapore that tasted like Coors light. The atmosphere was cool however so I give props to that. A very cool concept but honestly prefer El Burro in regent square. Better tacos and at half the price."}
{"text":"Awesome! I wish I lived closer so that I could make this a regular stop. The tacos were amazing, guacamole to order was a hit and of course the drinks were creative and tasty. I love a place with great service. This place was slammed and the waiter didn't miss a beat. Fairly priced and great quality!! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I think the reviews are a little overrated. It is a good place with decent food but a bit overpriced in my opinion. The cucumber margarita was delicious and the chips and salsa was disappointing. The salsa was bland and lifeless. Had the chicken taco which was good."}
{"text":"Best Tacos ever.  The irony is I don't think they do anything crazy, just keep it simple. All they really sell here is tacos, just be aware of that before you go :)  Seriously though, probably some of the best tacos I ever had.  My family of 4 went and we had 4 different tacos and all were excellent.  Reserve well in advance, it can be hard to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Tako was an amazing experience of deliciousness! Our server was super awesome, environment was super awesome and the food was SUPER awesome. We got 2 of the current specials - barbacoa and crispy shrimp. The only reason I rate 4 stars instead of 5 is because guy cleaning the tables kept spraying tables next to him without realizing it. My husbands elbow and app plate got sprayed pretty good.... no one wants cleaner in that delicious perfection."}
{"text":"Always looking for a new delicious and fun environment to try in Pittsburgh... And we always end up back at Tako! (5th time, and will be back soon.) So delicious. So many great menu options from starters, tacos, margaritas, and other cocktails, Tako is a must stop for anyone looking for good food and fun, whether you sit inside or out on the sidewalk of the Cultural District. (Korean Tacos are my favorite!) Make sure you call and make reservations! So worth it."}
{"text":"This is such a great Mexican restaurant! My friend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night (7:45pm was the earliest reservation we could get... it's always busy here!)  I ordered the Squash Blossom tacos and Heirloom corn tacos... both were specialities of the season.  My friend ordered the Poke and Mushroom tacos.. also excellent!  For dessert we got the Ice Cream Tacos.  The staff was very friendly and the waitress even paid for our dessert because she had mis-told us about the options still available at the kitchen.  Highly recommend and definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We went for the day of the dead event and not only was there free face painting the menu for the event was awesome. I do enjoy the corn on the cob better but when you mixed the corn with the avocado dip it was awesome. Just one thing the specialty cocktails were all very sweet. With they would have had other options. Other than that choice place friendly staff! Definitely be back"}
{"text":"Margs, Guac, Tacos...all amazing! I like my Margs Clean, Guac Classic, & my tacos full of flavor! I fell in love with Tako on my second visit to Pittsburgh. I sat outside watching the skilled artisans in the kitchen make Guac & Tacos to order. My Margarita was delicious. The Guac perfection!...& the tacos...I ordered the chorizo sans egg...it sold me. I'm a fan! I went back when friends came in town & ordered the Korean awesome! Such a fun atmosphere! Can't wait to head back for more!"}
{"text":"An outstanding Tako restaurant with extreme care taken to create unique dishes that are elaborate and very flavorful.  Sitting at the outside bar let's you witness the process."}
{"text":"Ok so when you walk in and there's a line to sit at the bar to eat your in for a treat!! I travel 2-3 weeks a month and eating at the bar is my usual location and I will always wait for an opening. I was third down peering down the bar looking for that person who was close to wrapping it up. It took about 15 minutes to get the stool. Coincidently two spots opened and I sat next to number 2 inline and elderly lady who appeared to be a regular. Now being a newbie I didn't realize until I looked at the menu this is a Taco bar, but not just your average, run of the mill tacos. They are and I am not sure it's the right term, gourmet tacos. They also have a great variety of apps, and unfortunately since I was solo, and didn't want to fill up on it, but they have a build your own guac!! I have to figure out a way to do this, I was about to ask my line partner, but she ordered before I could. So to the food, I started with the kale and avocado salad, STRONG!!! Incredibly tasty with 1/2 sliced avo, so I got my health on with some good greens and good fat!! For the tacos I got the Pollo Asado and again avocados, they were OUTSTANDING, you get two good sized tacos, very flavorful and right proportion of everything. I love that this place is a block away from my hotel!! This place will on my regular rotation on my travels to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Never had a marg with jalapenos before , great way to tame the sweet with some heat. The portions here are huge, dont be decieved by the orders of two, its plenty! Cool ambience as well. I intend to return"}
{"text":"So, my wife and I were visiting beautiful Pittsburgh for the Steelers game. We happened to be there for New Years Eve, we tried getting into restaurants, but they were packed.  We stumbled on this place, TAKO and were told there were only room at the bar, which was perfect for us.  We ordered some beers, were greeted by a very friendly bartender and told of the drinks and how they served their tacos.  My wife had the carnitas tacos (two on an order) and I had the chicken.   So, being Mexican-American (my wife and I) and coming from California, where there are endless taco shops, we didn't expect much from this place, especially in Pittsburgh, PA.  But, we were wrong!!!!!  HOLY SMOKES, so, the tortillas are hand made(can't get better than that), the meats had a wonderful taste to them and were served with salsa, avocado, cilantro, queso fresco(fresh Mexican cheese) and were packed with meat!!!!!!!!!   Some of the BEST TACOS my wife and I have EVER!!! had!!!    Come to find out this restaurant is owned by a chef who also owns two other restaurants in town.  Looks like he did his homework really good on how to perfect a great taco in Pittsburgh.   My wife and I would fly back to Pittsburg (If we were rich, lol) just to eat at this place!! that's how good and fun this place was.   I highly, highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.  THIS PLACE IS A MUST and coming from two Latino's from Cali, it got 4 thumbs up from us!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Was told there would be a 45 minute wait but it ended up being only 10-15. Margarita was delicious. Waitress was great.   Had the octopus tacos. They were good but not worth the price. Guac was mediocre and a tiny portion for $14. Chicken taco was bland IMO, which I found strange because it looked well seasoned. Just not worth the price for what you get. Don't let the words 'gourmet' and 'fusion' fool you."}
{"text":"I LOVE tako! My favorite is the Poke Bowl.  Decor and atmosphere is cool.  I've been there multiple times and plan to go many more."}
{"text":"This is so vanilla to say but the chicken taco was one of the best I've ever had. It was a party of flavors. Like eating a rave."}
{"text":"This is probably my third favorite taco IN THE COUNTRY!   The lamb tacos were to die for. Lets start with the meat - succulent, tasty, and juicy as hell. The real kicker is the other ingredients. Perfect in variety, portion, and layering. The crispies inside the taco were DIVINE. Let's finish with the tortilla. So nice, unique, and tasty!  The choco taco was delicious as well. A very 'chef'y dessert with dark cherries on bottom. The ceviche was good not great. I'll have to try the guac and more tacos next time.  It's very dark and vibey in here. Hipster fancy ta  Definitely come here when in Pittsburgh. I do wish when I got bar seating and there was a seat outside, they had seated more there instead of inside though. Poor hostess move. The awesome bartender makes up for it."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this restaurant. There was a line at the door before they opened &  they had room for reservations only.  My wife and I ordered custom guacamole & chips-excellent. We then ordered the carnitas & bistec tacos-amazing. Great flavors & the most tender & moist meats.  On top of that, the service was top notch & the decor is interesting, \"trendy\", and comfortable."}
{"text":"Really interesting take on some classics.  Even the basic nachos were done much better than average - fresh fried tortillas, really good queso.  The brisket was pretty much off the charts.  The only downside is its a bit more expensive than its counterparts but overall, really good quality food"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Finally was able to make reservations and try this place. Made them on a Thursday. We had the guacamole and then ordered three different tacos. You get two tacos with the order. We have the fried fish, pork belly and chorizo. All wonderful. Only thing was the fish was undercooked. Been there a few times now and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great, filling tacos, very worth the price.  Everything we got was really good.  Highly recommend the guacamole."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great specials and standard menu. The drinks are creative! Prices are reflective of the quality of foods and the service is out of this world! Shout out to the Beef Tongue, Pork Belly and Duck Confit Tacos!"}
{"text":"Well, it was opening night, so things could still go wrong...but I doubt it'll happen, based on how well Butcher and the Rye has held up.  The staff was incredibly nice, and almost too quick to clean off our table (I lost a side plate before I could even stop her). Fortunately, staff is always there waiting to help (plate restored!). The manager was attentive and when I shrugged shoulders for one of my dishes when our waitress asked how it was, he quickly came over to ask what I didn't like, what could be improved, etc. You really can't have a better start, service-wise.  The space is awesome to take in, with the octopus theme running wild. Adventurous concept, visually,  and just over-the-top enough to be a talking point, while never interfering with the experience. It's dark, so expect to bring a light for the menu.  The food was excellent. We had the Al Pastor, Bistec, Tako, and Carnitas tacos. All good, with my only exception being the thick and hard-to-get-through octopus on the Tako taco. Curious if I'll be the only one to make suggestions to the manager on that one. Flavor-wise, it was good. Just texture wasn't ideal. Otherwise, food was spot-on. I'd recommend it all!  Also started with the Asian Bolognese ask the Papas Bravas. We just returned from Barcelona and Bravas'd our faces off, so I can't say they beat our best there, BUT I'd order again. The bolognese was excellent.   All-in-all, I'm already looking forward to going back. If the service and food holds up like tonight (opening nights are always hit-or-miss), it'll become a staple in our Pittsburgh restaurant shortlist. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As I walked in a server apologized for the busy environment and stated it was usually busy. They have a good amount of tables to sit at outside, as well as a out door(on the side walk)bar. We had a reservation. It was very busy, but were sat immediately...after my bud arrived (read the bottom). It took a few minutes for our server to greet us, but he was very nice and had a good sense of humor, so I'll let that pass.     The menu was not very big, which I like, so it was easier to choose what we wanted. And the server was knowledgeable of everything we asked about the menu. We chose the street corn and the chips and salsa to start. The street corn was amazing! The sauces that drenched the corn were very tasty and had a lil kick and taste of lime to them. The corn cob itself was cooked just right. I only wish they had served them with little knobs so that it would have been easier and less messy to eat (cuz I like to be a lady). The chips were served with three salsas (a hot red pepper/tomato, a medium/verde(green) salsa, and a mild tomato salsa. I enjoyed the hot salsa so much, I requested a to go order of it. The chips themselves were nice and crispy and not stale. You can tell they were not store bought.   I also ordered the cucumber margarita. This is a margarita I will forever love. The tequila was not over powering, yet the cucumber stood out, giving a very refreshing taste to it. Loved this drink!    Finally, the chicken tacos (pollo asado). There were two served on a wood plank( nice touch). The chicken was not dry and was marinated well with a hard grilled taste. They were served atop of soft tortillas, covered with diced white onion, salsa verde, queso fresco, a sweet taste crema, serreno, and cilantro. It all came together very well.    Although the food was very tasty, and the atmosphere was nice and warm, and the server was very nice I will stand by my four star on simply that I did not find the bathroom situation very appealing (being that there was one and it was right next to the bar), as well as the hostess with the mostest was not so much. I was given the cold shoulder for a good 2 minutes, even after being seen by a fellow server and still not addressed until my other half arrived. Made my beginning moments of the place very skeptical. However, I will fancy myself to come back. The food was good and I enjoyed the ambiance."}
{"text":"So here's the deal. Book in advance to coming otherwise you'll be at the bar or waiting for a table at the bar.   We came on a Wednesday night and found ourselves having to sit at the bar which was actually a pleasant experience, despite being a group of 3, because the waitresses were very nice! But for anything larger than 3, I would recommend calling ahead.   The atmosphere was very cool, unless you thought too hard about it because the Last Supper, the Kraken, and being locked inside a industrial freezer don't seem to go together.   We started off with the papas bravas and the make-your-own-guac. Both of which were spectacular! The papas bravas was probably my favorite thing we had ordered all night. And, if we weren't gluttons then, we got tacos to top it off.   The Korean tacos were definitely good, spicy and tender. However, the baja tacos were awful, I couldn't even choke it down. The tilapia, which usually has a very mild taste, stunk of a very fishy smell. Maybe it was just that batch of bad tilapia, but our tacos paid the price.   While it is a bit pricey, their prices are not outrageous for the quality (despite the baja tacos) that you get. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good was V good. The potatoes and build your own guac? Don't mind if I do. Swordfish tacos were great. If you are strolling through downtown is check it out. Go early to avoid a wait but be aware it is v dark inside. I'd go back."}
{"text":"The only reason there isn't five stars is due to how crowded it gets and the space inside gets tiiiiiight sometimes. But the food is always great. I'm obsessed with the Korean tacos and the coconut pudding dessert thing is my FAVORITE!!!"}
{"text":"You MUST have a reservation, otherwise ..you wait for the bar, very authentic food!! The spicy cucumber margarita is spectacular. I ordered goat cheese app and gauc, loved every bite. For main course I ordered the carnitas and they were the best tacos I ever had! Service was alright."}
{"text":"I previously rated this restaurant a 4, but after this recent experience I felt that the following aspects of our dining experience made me feel a bit unsatisfied with the meal:  - Pricey: Guacamole #2, 2 orders of tacos (4 total), a drink and dessert came to $73.  - Guac: overall would have been nice but this was very much oversalted. Combined with salted housemade chips (which were delicious, great texture), I felt that I was eating a mush of salt.  -Carnitas taco: meat texture was phenomenal, very tender but overall was very heavy. From my previous experience I remember this to be lighter, perhaps they would benefit from something acidic such as a lime, but their chef(s) are the ones in charge.  -Bistec: again meat texture was great but I personally felt that the taco as a whole would have benefited from something to balance out the heaviness.   Choco taco: thick waffle taco with cookies/cream filling, smothered in some kind of cherry compote and banana chips. Overall a great concept and beautifully plated. However, waffle to ice cream ratio was too small because I too frequently was trying to find something to pair with the waffle (they do provide a huge jug of water!). Lastly, I did not find that the banana chips added to the dessert. Perhaps something citrus to go better with cherries...idk I'm not a qualified chef...let's not be too picky here!"}
{"text":"Tako was on my foodie lists for months and a friend and I finally had time for dinner there last week. We had an 8:45 reservation and we arrived around 8pm so we started with a drink at the sister restaurant, Butcher and the Rye. To our delight, we were seated within ten minutes! The place was packed but the table space was ample. We were greeted by our very friendly waitress and she gave us the drink menu, food menu and separate MTO gauc menu. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! MTO Gauc?! Dreams do come true. They have a menu dedicated to creating the perfect bowl of gaucemole. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to place my order dive in. In total, we ordered Papa Bravas, gauc with pickled habanero pepper, onion, corn, and pepitas, and one of their specials- roasted butternut squash tostada with pistachio butter, feta cheese, cilantro and roasted veggies. For drinks, we ordered the daily frozen feature of the merlot marg and their strawberry yuzu.   The drinks were fantastic. Fresh & smooth with just enough of a kick.  Our gauc and papa bravas arrived first. I'm happy to report that despite my extreme excitement for the gauc, I took time to savor each bite so that I could give the Yelping world a fair review...so, here it is: Excellent gauc!!! Seriously, 5 star creation. Unfortunately, the gauc was paired with awful chips. I don't use the word awful lightly. These chips were a huge disappointment. They tasted like Tostito chips that were tossed in a warming pan for too long. Processed, non-authentic corn chips, WOMP :( I expected more out of Tako!! The chips didn't ruin the experience but they certainly knocked my review from a 5 to a 4. Alright, on to the next... Papa Bravas: sweet gracious, I am going to dream of these scrumptious taters. The crunch of the fried potato combined with the spicy tomato sauce offset by the garlic aioli- I am salivating while typing this- The oregano butter didn't pull through for me but that's okay, this dish was amazing.  Finally, our butternut squash tostada arrived. I didn't realize it came with feta but it was my fault for not asking. I'm sure it tasted good with the cheese but I picked mine off since I am not a dairy fan. Regardless of that ingredient being removed, the dish was great but not perfect. The pistachio butter was my favorite part, I almost licked the bottom of the plate (don't judge) The butternut squash was a bit too crunchy and under cooked but the rest of the veggies were bursting with flavor and the combination of it all made for an delicious and filling end to our meal. We wanted to try the tacos but we were bursting at the seams! The portion sizes of everything were larger than I expected, definitely worth the cost.   The service was well executed the whole night and overall, I am very pleased. I am looking forward to going back to try the tacos and more of the drink menu!"}
{"text":"Wish there was more seating because it is so popular that it is always crowded but food is delicious and so are the drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is very hip and trendy and hard to get a table. In other words, a kind of place I would normally avoid these days as I have very little patience particularly while hungry. However, my dining companion was nice enough to make a reservation for us, and when we were feeling like two old ladies and wanted to try to show up to sit earlier than our set reservation, they were surprisingly fine with it and let us sit right away. I think what makes it hard is if you show up with no reservation and a big group, as I saw several of those lingering by the door hoping to be seated.   While entering the restaurant you can peek in the window and see the cooks making fresh tortillas and I knew it would be a good taco experience because - let's be honest - so much depends on the tortilla! We went with the mushroom and Baja tacos, which were HUGE and though they're pricey for tacos (about $12-15), the ingredients are top quality and the portions are satisfying. We also got the guac and the street corn and starters, which was maybe not the smartest thing to do as it did fill us up, but both were delish as well!   We were having a non-drinking evening so the server offered to make us virgin versions of their watermelon basil  margarita and OMG - they were so refreshing and fresh!   As for the ambiance, it's very dark and loud and trendy, as I've mentioned, so maybe not the best place if you're in the mood for a romantic date or a chill conversation. It felt very see and be seen, but again the helpful service and the high quality food helped it live up to the hype.   Huge fan, hope I can return soon!"}
{"text":"From start to finish one of the best meals I've had. The guac is made to perfection. The Pineapple and Jalapeno margarita is heavenly and the Baja taco is the best I've had. The Tres Leches was a perfect end to the meal. All I can say is that I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"First time here so I made a dinner reservation. Great drink  selection (i.e. Tequila and mescal). I ordered a custom guacamole, which the server forgot about, so I'm still looking forward to trying the food sometime. Overall, this place is supposed to be trendy, but ends up attracting mostly yuppies and old people."}
{"text":"Awesome place that puts a nice twist on tacos. They offer a range of fushion flavors that go surprisingly well together. One star off for being a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Best food and drinks! You HAVE to try the Papa Bravas!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had a delicious late night meal after the Pirates game. We are from California, and pleased to find this great spot, a short walk from PNC Park. We asked for classic margaritas (not on the menu) and waiter said \"no problem\". Bartender delivered perfect margaritas. Baja fish tacos and pork al pastor tacos were excellent. Staff attentive and were very helpful getting us transport back to our hotel. Good, hip vibe and overall excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Tako was delicious! My bf and I went on a Monday evening since we figured it would be a slower night. Thank goodness we made a reservation! It was still pretty busy. I bet the weekends are packed. I loved the decor of the restaurant! Very cool vibe. I ordered the Sookie Stackhouse cocktail to start and loved it! My bf got a beer and said they had a nice selection with very reasonable prices. For appetizers, we ordered the chips and salsa and then picked one of the chef's selection guacamole. I enjoyed every type of salsa and the guacamole was very unique. I ordered the Carnitas taco and my bf ordered the Tako (octopus) taco. Loved both although I favored the Carnitas surprisingly. The reason I didnt give a perfect score is because the tables in the front are way too close together. I could barely hear my bf over the conversations of our neighbors. I also think I booty bumped the one table when I was trying to leave. But overall we loved Tako and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great food, margaritas, and service! Always enjoy my experience at Tako."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for 4 weeks in total for business.  Of that 4 weeks I've visited tako 5 times.  It's not because it was located down the street from my hotel or because there was any lack of choices when it came to dinner.  It was simply because they have really GOOD food here.  Over the span of my 5 visits I've had a chance to try the beet \"faux\" tartare, Ahi Tuna poki, octopus taco, fish taco, and the waygu short rib taco aka \"The korean\".  Out of everything I've tried what kept me going back was in fact the Korean.  I've only scratched the surface when it comes to trying everything on the menu but I now I can't go wrong with the Korean.  I prefer to sit outside in the stool but sometimes I've had to sit inside at the bar.  The service outside is lackadaisical - it's like they forget you're even there.    But it's worth seeing the chefs in action.  Sometimes it is tough to get a seat/table so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Good food and good selection of specialty margaritas.  The interior decoration is unique, but somewhat dark.  Overall, a good place."}
{"text":"I am in love with their red sangria. So delicious! A tip if you don't have a reservation, if you arrive a few minutes before opening and wait in line, you can almost always get a seat at the bar and the bartenders are awesome. The food is fantastic. I'm in love with the street corn. The description sounds a little scary (mayo in corn?!?) but it is delicious.  We are also fans of their queso fundido. Super creamy, just the right amount of spice, and the warm tortillas are awesome. We could easily have made a meal of just the corn and queso.  The tacos are fantastic as well, we've tried carnitas, pollo asado, and baja and all have been fantastic. They also run specials that change nightly. The vibe here is dark and a little loud. It can be a bit difficult to see your feed or talk to your dining companions, not somewhere I would go for s romantic night out. But the music is normally awesome, and they have a few seats outside if you want to check those out."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but pricey. Their tacos are unique and well made. The restaurant is pretty cool as well"}
{"text":"Great options of some crazy shiz! So good. Guacamole was unreal, so amazing! Octo Tako was great. Pollo Taco, Surf and Turf, Chorizo, Duck all amazing. El Presidente from the DR. #bartolocolon"}
{"text":"This review is for take out, but what was great is that the food tasted as if I was still dining in-house. I ordered the korean tacos and the thrice cooked wings. The tacos had a perfectly cooked tortilla with TONS of beef in it. They did not skimp at all. All of the flavors on top, inside, around, upside down blended amazingly and it was a really delicious taco. Two come with the meal. The thrice cooked wings - it was a big portion actually, maybe about 8 wings? I didn't finish so I'm not 100% sure. It was cooked with a fish sauce base and that made it nice and sticky and flavorful!  The one thing that sucked was that they didn't put in my order when I called and when I stopped by to pick it up 30 minutes later, they basically had to start from scratch. Bummer, but the manager did provide me with a gift card to make up for it. Too bad I'm not from the area but hopefully will make my way back because I would try it again despite this experience because the food was pretty worth it."}
{"text":"Very cool decor, excellent service. Ordered the guacamole with mango and crab: it was good. Ceviche was decent but I've had better. The chicken taco was my favorite in a close tie with the steak. The octopus \"tako\" was ok and so was the duck.    Wanted to try something new and was an overall good experience, but slightly overrated. I still think the taco truck in Pittsburgh has better tacos overall."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried tako yet, get there soon! Of all the restaurants my friends and I have been trying on our food list this is by far the favorite. The decor is very cool. I ordered the spicy passion fruit margarita which was very interesting and different. Even the presentation of their drinks is awesome.  We started the meal off with the chips and salsa. All 3 were very good and some were a little spicy but it wasn't overwhelming. But let's talk about the tacos...most unique and flavorful tacos I've had. My friend and I ordered both the Korean tacos and the pollo asado tacos to share. The chicken tacos had great flavor and the chicken was not over cooked like chicken typically is. The Korean tacos were an interesting spin on a typical Mexican taco.   Overall I give tako a 5 star and I can't wait to go back and try more tacos!"}
{"text":"I only had one night in Pittsburgh, and was insanely happy with my visit here. They were one of the few places downtown to be open late on a Monday (why do downtowns hate Mondays?? People still have to eat!). Even though we got there roughly 30 minutes before the kitchen closed, the staff didn't seem annoyed at all, and did not rush us to put in our food order. Everything we ordered was sublime! I got the fish tacos and the watermelon basil margarita. The margarita was incredibly refreshing, and not at all too sweet! My friend ordered the beet tostada, which was incredible, and her grapefruit sage margarita was herby and light (though I still preferred mine, if I had to choose). To top it all off, they were able to separate all five of our checks, which is convenient when traveling with a group. The atmosphere was also unique and inviting. I'll definitely try to stop by again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ive been here three times and each time it was completely different.  Do not make the mistake and order a salad or desert from here awful!!! Taco were great the very first time which kept me coming back but 2nd and 3rd time everything was downhill from there.."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Tako!!! Foods is awesome! The guacamole and salsas are all delicious! My only two complaints would be the warm water the serve in a glass jar!! I'm just so used to ice cold water! And I think their drinks are pricey. $10 for a very small margarita it was yummy but small!! Besides that everything is great! Great atmosphere, food and service!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had.....i'm from ny and my boyfriend and i would drive the 6.5 hours just to eat here again.....that's how amazing it is....we got the pork and pineapple tacos amd the chorizo taco with an over easy egg...they also have a paper where you customize your own guacamole....we are only here for 3 days and i think we are going back again tomorrow...thats how good it is.....our server jason was awesome too !  Thank you for all your recommendations!!!! I've been a server for over 10 years and Jason you now your stuff and you were so nice  my boyfriend is a chef and the food blew his tits off.....see you tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Go for the cocktails and the guacamole . The tuna belly guac and the spicy cucumber cocktail were both amazing . The tacos on the other hand were more of a let down . The tortillas were Meh, and it almost felt like they were trying to be too edgy and unique with the fusion flavors on the tacos so it was so much going on . We ordered a ton of food because we wanted to try everything  and they were all so heavy, they could even make the tacos smaller so people can experience more. If you have ever had tacos from the west coast these don't even compare . We also got the tres leches cake for dessert which tasted like one of those frozen boxed cakes, we had one bite and left it."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Tako but I feel like this place is a bit overhyped.  I loved the outside which looked like a real taqueria, but once we went inside it looked more like a club scene--it was quite dark, cramped, loud, and there was even a DJ spinning.  This might be fun for a club/bar scene, but this is supposed to be a restaurant and they were still serving dinner.  I could barely hear my friend speak or the waiter.  The inside atmosphere was very hipster and a bit pretentious.   We weren't able to get a dinner reservation until 10pm since they were so busy, so my friend and I had already had drinks elsewhere first.  Since I was driving I decided to order a soda.  Our malebun-wearing pretentious hipster waiter got all offended by this and stormed off without even taking my friend's order.  Another waiter returned 15 min later with my soda and they still didn't ask my friend what she wanted to drink.  It's possible he was also offended because I missed or misunderstood something he said because it was so loud in there.  But this did not get us off to a good start.    We had the queso dip which was quite good, though a little pricey, and we needed to get more tortillas to go with it.  The octopus taco (which this placed is named for, as tako means octopus in japanese) was amazing.  The best octopus taco I ever had.  I also had a carne asada taco which felt like it was lacking in some key ingredient and was not that memorable.  The waiter finally spoke to us and became more friendly when he was all excited to explain all the homemade salsas.  Unfortunately none of them were very impressive.  One tasted just like a bbq sauce, not a salsa, and none were very spicy.  Definitely not authentic tasting.  In general, the prices are a bit high compared to other places that have comparable tacos and you don't get any side dishes or anything with your meal.    I'd go back for the octopus taco but nothing else I thought was really amazing.  I will have to go back for their drinks another time, as they did appear to have a good tequila selection."}
{"text":"This place is definitely interesting.  It looks pretty innocent front the outside, with the nice outdoor seating looking into the kitchen. But the inside is very different. Had a very lounge theme, with minimal lighting and loud loud music. Definitely not some place to go for a first date, as it feels very seductive and you wouldn't be able to hear your date at all.   The service was great.  We had a fabulous waiter that was very friendly. The food was really good too. We got the octopus and al pastor tacos. The tacos have a LOT of filling so you will definitely be full from ordering the tacos alone (come in sets of 2). I read a lot of people complaining about the price, which I completely disagree with. Maybe because I am visiting from CA, but I thought the price points were good. The al pastor was $12, thats $6 per taco with very large fillings. The octopus was $18 total but you got a large piece of an octopus tentacle that was so worth it.   The octopus taco was amazing. The octopus was tender and so soft. The sauce was good too.   I thought the al pastor was way too salty. It was very tasty but I thought there was too much going on there, with the spicy sauce and the pineapples. My husband loved it, so to each their own."}
{"text":"A lively place tucked away on a main street in Pittsburgh. We walked in and were told it would be pretty much forever until we got a table, so we stood awkwardly in the entryway and kept an eye on the bar. Lo and behold, a table opened up and we were able to sit down. Thank goodness, because this place is busy and very cramped quarters. Pretty dark, noisy, and nifty decor. We started with the pineapple/jalapeno margarita and a Mexican coke. We also ordered some queso fundido - and oh man was it awful. Terrible cheese that was not any cheese we've ever had - we've been having bad luck with queso fundido - what gives?! So bad, considering our tacos were amazing. Tried the bistek and carnitas tacos, as well as something with apricot -very yummy. So, go for the tacos and the drinks but stay away from the cheese. Yuck! I'd recommend reservations as well to ease any frustration in such a small space."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and cocktails! The atmosphere is awesome - I could hang out here for hours!"}
{"text":"Spicy cucumber Margerita  just stole my heart. Ordered a chicken taco, fish taco and street corn. Everything was perfect and just out of this world except for the fish tacos which were pretty bland. Our server was super amazing, he replaced the fish taco for a chicken one. All in all had an amazing time and the best food one can get in Pittsburg. Wish I could give it a 100 stars. Looks like I ll have to have a permanent reservation here."}
{"text":"Perhaps a better tag for this restaurant would be Asian fusion.  Tako, as I remembered after my meal, is the Japanese word for octopus. Their logo is also quite literally an octopus. None of this got through my head as me and my girlfriend dropped by on a cold November night.  \"Sweet, let's get some Mexican food,\" I thought as we rolled in. The dimly lit insides were reminiscent of lounges reserved for Upper West Side New Yorkers, with an atmosphere that is simultaneously sultry and bustling.  Two bar seats and two cocktails later, we were diving into the nori guacamole (highly recommended) and the street corn. Things still haven't clicked in my mind.  The tacos arrived (we ordered two each). I dove into my Carnitas taco, and my Duck taco (still not clicking). The Asian influences on flavor were very strong. Indeed, the duck taco tasted a lot like Peking Duck, but in taco form. Surprisingly, the Carnitas taco also tasted a lot like pork belly. My gf ordered the octopus taco (or tako taco). The octopus had none of the chewiness that was expected; rather, the octopus meat simply disintegrated as you chewed. The flavor was lighter than my orders, and lacked much of the \"seafood\" flavor.  It was only after the bill came around (pricey, but just barely worth it) and after I got a good look at their logo on their coaster that everything began to make sense.  Tako is an Asian fusion taco restaurant."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and service, pleasantly surprised by how good the tacos were, and decent size for what you pay, unlike other taco places around town (looking at you, Round Corner Cantina).   My friend wanted to check this place out for their restaurant week special, so we went late on a Wednesday night. I was surprised that at 9pm on a Wednesday this place was full and lively, but I suspect that is because of restaurant week. The special was chips and salsa, a small plate, and two orders of tacos (4 total, 2 per order) for $35. Seeing as to how we were going to split the bill, we decided it was perfect treat!  As mentioned above, I was surprised that a place this hyped up on Yelp actually met my expectations, especially given that it's a fancy place that has jumped on a new trend (tacos, much like the burger renaissance Pittsburgh experienced years ago). The traditional guac (+ cucumbers for texture--GREAT DECISION) was DELISH. Exactly what traditional guac should be. Chips were decent, and the tomato based salsa was bursting full of flavor and really good. The green stuff was not so good, but I'll get to that later.  We ordered the al pastor tacos and chorizo tacos and split them so that we each had one. I freaking love chorizo, and I freaking loved that taco. It had an egg on it, and it was like the best breakfast taco I've ever had and the sauce was spectacular! The al pastor has always been a personal favorite of mine, and tako knocked it out of the park. Very flavorful, grill marks on point, and again a unique and great sauce to accompany it.   Service was attentive without being overbearing, but we were a low maintenance table and didn't require much.   Overall the meal and experience was good! A few things to dock a star for:  The entrance is not clearly marked, and the front door looks like the door to a walk-in refrigerator. Seeing as to how the kitchen is open glass for the public to see, I thought we were accidentally walking into the kitchen, as the people at the hostess stand had their backs to us. As cool, funky, and trendy as the place is, they aren't above needing clear signage as to where the damn door is.   Our table was directly across from the one person bathroom. While there was (thankfully) no gross smell, the layout of the area (table, lockers, stairwell, server station, and door to the back of the house) caused it to seem a bit jammed up at times and was distracting. Space is crucial and I didn't need a need for them to take up an entire wall of valuable space with non-functioning lockers.  Given how great this meal was, I am appalled at how incredibly lacking of flavor the salsa verde was. It literally tasted like nothing. No salt, no pepper, garlic, cumin, flavor, ANYTHING. It was odd because the red salsa was FANTASTIC, but the salsa verde literally tasted as if they blended up the tomatillos and poured it into a fancy jar. So so so so so so so so so confusing and I'm assuming it was simply an overlooked batch because the flavors of everything else were above and beyond. I'll be back for everything but the green watery anomaly that they call salsa verde."}
{"text":"This is a must go place if you're in Pittsburgh. At the same time, it is a little overrated in my opinion. The food (and margaritas are exceptional) but the prices aren't the best. Something else to keep in mind is that you will not find your \"average\" taco here so you need to be prepared for that or else you will leave disappointed.   We always order the chips and guacamole as an appetizer to start. The chips are so light and crunchy.   Overall: highly recommend to try at least once"}
{"text":"We went right after the place opened, and it already had an hour long wait! Luckily, we snagged a spot at the bar and ordered drinks right away. The staff was charming, the margaritas were delicious, and the tacos was to die for. If you're a fan of pineapple, get the Al Pastor!!"}
{"text":"My only criticism is that it's a little pricey and hard to get into or get reservations. Otherwise a great late night snack or pre-theater dinner."}
{"text":"This place would be a solid 5 if it weren't for the noise and darkness! I'm not opposed to some mood lighting and music, but I think it's a bit much. However, it does make for a full experience! The decor and atmosphere is definitely fun and unique. The food... amazing! Definitely get the guacamole and chips to start. We ordered pineapple in ours, and our waiter told us that they vacuum seal the pineapples whole before cutting it, and soak it with vanilla and simple syrup. It seriously tastes like candy and melts in your mouth! I got the carnitas tacos for my main course, and they were delicious. Although the tacos are not huge, don't let them fool you. Mine were super super filling, and had a bit of a spicy kick to them. They were perfect! The actual taco shell itself is perfect, too. I could watch them being made from scratch from my seat. I did not order any drinks, but they all looked amazing. I would definitely recommend getting a reservation here, if you can!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but desperately want to return! The cheese was great as an appetizer, and I feel like it's addictive! I've been craving it ever since!  The bartender was friendly and wonderful and made sure to recommend items for us to try, which we greatly appreciated.  I had a nice sweet drink, but the name escapes me. If you're a sweet drink type of girl (or man), this place is probably not for you."}
{"text":"This place is great. We came here for a graduation dinner and had a reservation.  It is loud here, but we sat upstairs and had a nice big table.    We had a few apps and drinks, and the big taco board. We had the ceviche, poke, chips and salsa and the street corn.  The street corn was amazing, everything else was great.  We had a few drinks as well, the spicy cucumber margarita was very good.    For the taco board, we had the baja, octopus, korean and the al pastor. All of them were great.  We were really impressed with this place, very good food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I called for reservations early on a Saturday morning for a table that night. Staff called me around 2p to inform me that the earliest I could get a table would be 10.45p! We had Rolliing Stones tickets so...that wouldn't work. So, I lined up at 4.30p and we ran to the bar. Snatched two seats and reviewed both the drink and food menu.   Started with Cervices. Ended with two mushroom tacos. Both were great. The tacos in particular were fantastic. They had a great mixed of flavors and textures that popped. I couldn't finish two so it worked well with our food share plan for the night:)   The cocktails were prepared by an amazing tender. Not only did she craft great drinks, she knew how to carry on conversation. The latter is as important to me as the art of making the drink. We each had four cocktails and enjoyed each immensely. This was over the course of 2.5/3 hours and we walked off some of the buzz heading to Heinz Field.   Cannot wait to go back and spend another 3 hours saddled at Tako's rail."}
{"text":"This place will be my new go to. Restaurant week allowed us to experience three courses and glad that we did!  The salsa was fresh, and we had the option for more chips.  The frozen cocktail was refreshing. The desert lilly wasn't too sweet and had lovely floral and citrus undertones and paired well with our meal. They have a frozen drink du jour.   We couldn't decide whether to do make your own guacamole or do the three course. Eventually we decided on the three course dinner with the papas gravas and glad we did. Great sauce and a healthy portion- enough for two to split with a couple pieces left over. We sat outside and watched the make your own guac so we'll definitely be back for that.  The pollo and mushroom tacos were amazing. Definitely get the mushroom you won't be disappointed.  After all this food we were stuffed. Topped off with great customer service we can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant but it's a restaurant that you go to once or twice rather than one that you eat at regularly. I liked it for it's novelty!   I split a taco board with a group of friends which made it a much more affordable meal. It's around $78 for 6 tacos or so. My favorite taco was the \"tako\" which is fried spanish octopus+ikil pak+baby lettuce +charred jalapeño pico de gallo +pumpkin seeds. It was amazing but not filling per se.   The drink choices here are also great but a little overpriced for the amount.  The ambiance is pretty cool because of the artwork, music and edison lights (my favorite!)."}
{"text":"Tako is very popular, and if you're planning on eating at a more common dinner hour, you will want to make a reservation online. As for me and my wife, however, we arrived right as it opened (5pm) and were seated immediately. You can try your luck and do the same (you could also sit and eat at the bar).   Inside ambiance is truly incredible. I really love the vibe of this restaurant. It's two floors. Pretty dark. Edison bulbs everywhere. It's very trendy. They have octopus tentacle sconces on the wall . . . I mean, where else do you see that?   We came and ate during restaurant week. We received chips and guac, 2 appetizers (ceviche and papa bravas), and 2 tacos (al pastor & pollo asado). The chips and gauc and salsa were great!! Portion was huge and was delicious. The two appetizers were also very tasty. The Ceviche app was small but sooo flavorful. I was impressed. It was refreshing. The papa bravas . . . Listen . . . I swear I'd come back just for those potatoes. I can't explain it. They're perfect. They're delicious. Honestly, you'll do yourself a disservice if you don't order that appetizer. Heck, id order that over one of their tacos. Yeah. The tacos were pretty good. My wife had the chicken but she didn't care for it too much because the chicken tasted gummy. I tasted to see . . . Yeah, they were a bit undercooked and tasted semi-strange as a result (I'm sure that was a fluke and not the norm). I thought the al pastor was pretty good as well, but I honestly wasn't blown away! For the normal price tag of these tacos, I don't know id rush back. I thought the appetizers were more appealing, which gives me a huge internal conflict as the name of the restaurant suggests where the emphasis should be!   But taken as a whole, from ambiance to service (incredible wait staff!!) to meal . . . This is a 4 star restaurant and well worth your visit and the wait. I will 100% come back and try the Tako taco. That's what is apparently out of this world, and I will update this review when I do try it!   Extra: Tako also had a stand in the Christmas village in Market Square. All I can say is, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Soooo so so good. I want the sandwiches they were selling every day of my life. If we are all so fortunate enough to see that stand there again next season, you do not want to miss!!"}
{"text":"It may be hard to snag a table at Tako still but if you do it is well worth it.   The Al Pastor tacos and the Tako taco are my favorite in the city. The flavors are intense, different and most importantly delicious.  While the tacos are the highlight, the guacamole is a strong second. The guac with tuna belly is so fresh and o so addicting. I have easily eaten half of a bowl of it on numerous occasions and I'm not ashamed of that at all, it's just that good."}
{"text":"Seriously Tasty Tacos.  Some nights I spend thinking about these tacos before I fall asleep.  I've only been here once. With a small group I don't recall if we had reservations (I feel like we did), we waited for a while in basically the way of everyone. Hugging the walls to make room for other guests and service persons. I believe there were six of us and we would not sacrifice a bad table for quick seating.  I remember ordering the chorizo sausage with fried egg on top, boy this was my favorite. The flavor was perfect and the egg was cooked perfectly making for a messy but absolutely delicious taco.  I had some decent red wine and the selection was satisfactory.  The noise level was a bit high for a large group wanting to be heard by all at the table. A small four person party would be my strong suggestion.  We were seated in the upstairs loft where the heat (I was dressed for our Pgh winters), the wine, or the combination got to me. I had to remove a couple layers.   While I was up there I got to get a good look at the metal work that was done on the chandeliers. They look awesome. I got lost in the detail for minutes at a time.   I will return..."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had, literally! The octopus taco was my favorite, though the rest were so amazing, it is hard to say for certain... I will be back very soon! Great decor. Had a slight steam-punk vibe. Art was everywhere! Try all of the dips! You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped her on a whim as we spent the night in Pittsburgh during a road trip. We were tired, hungry, and looking to visit solid Pitt foodie spots -- it seems as though we did just that! We didn't have to wait too long, especially having dropped in without a reservation. A quick stroll around the block and our table was ready. We started with a drink each, and were impressed by how professional and well made the drinks were. I had the grapefruit sidecar, and she had the watermelon margarita, and we were both happy with how refreshing they were -- a perfect drink to sit with outside.   We were eyeing the guac menu, but opted for the Mexican street corn instead. It was my girlfriends first encounter with it, and she's been making it at least once a week since. It's easy to say, she's hooked. We also had the chorizo and carnitas tacos, which were absolutely delicious. I loved seeing them making the tortillas by hand -- something I don't think I've ever seen before in any other restaurant. The fresh ingredients, from the tortillas to the sauces on top, make all the difference."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun albeit slightly too dark and loud . These things won't stop me from making it a frequent Pittsburgh stop though .The food is fabulous , the margaritas Devine and service top notch! A must are the octopus tacos. The crab guacamole is excellent     with light and crispy chips."}
{"text":"What's the fuss all about? And if you want to have a conversation - forget about it - way too loud. Better choices out there."}
{"text":"It's time. It's time I finally share the wonders of täk?. Maybe, although I've bellied up to the bar (for food, too, okay?) often, I haven't shared my experiences because I wanted to keep this secret all to myself. Well THAT obviously didn't work!   Let's begin with offerings from the bar. DO indulge! A classic margarita perhaps? A Ramon Gin Fizz? Maybe a Spicy Cucumber or a Classic Daiquiri or an Anjeo Witch or......SO many well created cocktails from which to choose. Or maybe a frozen concoction or interesting beer? Let your bartender guide you...some of the best in town are behind the stick.  On to the food. If you're a lover of guacamole, THIS is the best in town. You're given a slip of paper with add ins for your custom guac to check off with abandon. My hands down favorite combo is bacon (if nothing else, GET THE BACON!), roasted poblano and blue cheese. And the chips! Whoa.   The tacos. More to the point, the täk? tacos. The Japanese word for octopus is täk?, hence the täk? taco is an octopus one. And it's delicious! My first experience with the cephalopod, I'd say it tastes like a cross between lobster and shrimp with a similar texture.   More traditional? Don't miss the carnitas or al pastor tacos or if you'd like to step outside of the box without going all the way to octopus, the Korean tacos are an umami bomb of tender wagyu beef, fermented cucumber, pickled carrots and peanuts.   The atmosphere is comfortable, sexy even. If you're lucky enough to score a swing out seat on the sidewalk out front of the open kitchen, grab it! Oh, and word has it that brunch is coming soon. Shhhhhhhh...let's keep it out secret."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time at Tako and it never disappoints!! The red sangria and Al Pastor tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great! I loved all of my food choices! I chose the blood orange margarita and the bisteca taco and I was floating on air! I will be recommending this restaurant for the rest of my life because the whole set up of the restaurant was awesome! My best advice is to make a reservation grab a friend and melt into the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Uh......this place is amazing I mean hands down the best tacos I've ever had! There is a place in Chicago called El Hefe that rivals this, but still #1 in my book is Tako!   The queso fundido is a must try with the chorizo and cilantro on top, guacamole custom made and the bistec tacos (steak) the al pastor with the pineapple I mean I could go on an on and on...  If there are only two of you and you can't get a reservation just go, you'll get a seat at the bar. We made a reservation (6 weeks out) and waited, but after that we just go down and get a seat within 20-30 minutes. It's definitely worth the wait either way!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was absolutely delicious! The chips and guac were great and so fresh. We ordered the Korean taco and the shrimp tempura taco and both were excellent, but the Korean taco was a little on the spicy side! Also the whole atmosphere of the resultant was so cool and unique!"}
{"text":"Busy place with great Miami feel. The food is to die for and the bartenders are amazing.  You have to try the ceviche and the chorizo/bistec tacos!! Mouth watering"}
{"text":"One of our favorites. Reservations are tough to get but well worth the wait! I don't want to invite my foodie friends from NY.  Everything we've tried is amazing! It's quickly becoming our go to place whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Guacamole: DELICIOUS. Ramon's Gin Fizz: Best drink ever. Chugged that down and served in a fun tiki cup. Feels like I'm on vacation. Tacos: PACKED tortilla, juicy meat, full of flavor.   The menu is set up like a newspaper, it's pretty cool. The ambiance is pretty chill and there's like giant octopuses drawn everywhere.   I'm very impressed with the new restaurants popping up in Pittsburgh. Very good meal. Very full with two tacos."}
{"text":"I often talk about tacos being street food...and they are, but damn what amazing street food tako sells. I had the Tako Taco, or octopus. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It is a little pricey for tacos but there is no arguing the quality. Will definitely be trying again soon."}
{"text":"Food and service were both excellent.  Dishes where you expected average result were raised to exlempory by preparation. Something as simple as chcken wings were made special. Crispy on the outside while falling off the bone these.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations, I love octopus and always order Octopus whenever I see it on the menu. The octopus tacos here are $18, it's two tacos but I must say, they are generous with their portions. They give 2 big tentacle pieces per taco, and one order is enough to fill someone up. The tacos themselves however, were not good. I felt the octopus tentacle were not very fresh. The tentacles themselves tasted burnt to me, it was not cooked well. The whole taco, and what they put in it didn't match to me as well, the whole thing just tasted like a lot of burnt. I didn't like it at all. I also got the seviche, which I thought was just ok as well, the fish didn't taste very fresh to me."}
{"text":"Solid 4-star restaurant! I really was not expecting much when first stepped into the bar area of the restaurant to meet with some colleagues for dinner. That obviously changed when we started getting the food. The waitress recommended the chicken tacos which I got. They were absolutely fantastic... so succulent and out of this world. Everyone else in the party thought the same of their particular taco. Definitely was not expecting a place like this in Pittsburgh, PA. My only complaint was the noise level (bar) which was to be expected. I would highly recommend this place for a night out!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had 6:00 reservations on a Sunday.  We arrived early but were promptly seated.  The exceptional service continued the entire meal - kudos to our server, Damian.  Food was very good on all accounts: chips and salsa, guacamole #2, tako tacos and the steak tacos (our favorite of the evening).  In terms of food, beverages and service - it was a great night.  It was our experience that the restaurant was quite loud.  Between the music volume and energized conversations from other diners - we could often not hear one another and frequently had to repeat ourselves.  Although the lighting was fine for eating/drinking/conversing, it was a too dim to read the menus.  We will certainly return for a chance to explore other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place at all. First, I was disappointed by the Margaritas in a glass full of ice for $10, in one sip it was gone. Then, I asked for a Margarita straight up so it wouldn't have ice and they brought a tinny glass barely any drink on it. I haven't seen anything like this in any restaurant. Second, some of us ask for the Steak tako that is one of the most expensive on the menu. We couldn't eat it, the steak was so hard that we almost choked. They must buy the lowest quality steak in the market. I realized this restaurant only cares to make money, and provides no satisfaction to the customers. Would not recommend and never going there again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to restaurants in Pittsburgh. Reservations are difficult on weekends--get em early on."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to visit the infamous Tako!!!!! We did make a reservation, but it didn't seem like it would have been necessary when we got there. I love the atmosphere -  dim lights with cool beats and sounds. I started the evening off with the Thai Coconut drink, and it was very delicious with a little kick For appetizers, I ordered the Thrice Cooked Wings. Ok, so the fish sauce smell will definitely make you lean back when you put the wing to your mouth. However, once tasting it....I wasn't able to stop eating it. And for the entrée, I ordered the Pollo Asado. It was good but a bit spicy in some bites of it. In one bite, I thought I was on fire!!!!!! It took for ever for my mouth and throat to cool off. The flavor of the chicken was ok. My friend ordered Poke for her appetizer. I tasted it, but wasn't a fan. But in Tako's defense, I am not a huge sushi fan. But she loved it! The service was nice, and they did not feel too overbearing. Which is always a plus for me.  Now, would I come back......hmmm, yes I would. It iis just, nothing was measuring up to all the rave. But it isnt bad. I think it is another cool spot in the downtown area for a date night or a little din din before a show. But honestly, I think this restaurant has been a bit hyped up, for some odd reason."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Seriously.... every single thing! My friends and I waited 2 months for a reservation for 6. It was worth the wait. We've already made reservations for next time. We had a lot of the appetizers on the menu. I can say that they were all PERFECTION. The Papa Bravas were out of this world. I ordered what I thought would be a basic taco \"Pollo Asado\" and it was anything but basic. I've really never had anything better. Highly Highly HIGHLY recommend this place! We'll be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue; but there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. Tako is phenomenal, and I'm already planning my next visit!   My whole table ordered different drinks, but the winner was the grapefruit and sage margarita (my pick, naturally). This margarita is not to be missed - refreshing and just bitter enough.   The only downside, in my opinion, was the service. We had a larger group, which isn't optimal for tako's space. Our waiter seemed a bit annoyed by that. He was constantly coming to our tables and nearly pushed us out of the restaurant. But the food made up for it, so we were not to hung up on the less-than-desirable service.   A tip: be sure to make a reservation, since the space is quite small.   Looking forward to my next time at tako!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop by Bang Bang 5 stars hands down, hats and pants off this was great.   I had the Tako, the Chorizo and the Korean. Each as good as the other and each worth every dime you pay. This is some good chow people. Clearly well thought out layered textures and flavors that make you go, \"holy elephant Sh** that may have been the best thing I've ever tasted!\"  That doesn't graze the surface though. The build your own guac was pow pow dot com and damn good. Decent serving size for two or four depending on if you came hungry or just looking to add to the already,\"have to change my pants\" inducing tacos.  The drinks are also exceptional. What do you expect? The food is on point, so everything else should fall in place right? Usually that would be false. Not this time amigos. Michelada. Yes. Elderflower Marg? yes. Dimly lit. Exclusive feel. Chill Service. Nice Music. Yes, Yes, Yes and YES.  As far as I'm concerned this, for the time being, is #1 in Pittsburgh for me. If you're lady-dogging about the price(4 star haters) you can drive your ass out of the city 2,400+ miles south-west and get all you can eat tacos for 100 pesos.   The prices are \"New York Prices\"-- With the power invested in me as dude with the ability to cognitively reason and draw comparative conclusions based on experience and a passion for food and travel, this place is priced appropriately for what you are fed and deserves 5-stars and a standing O dammit."}
{"text":"I am officially in love with täk?.  We showed up around 5:00 on a Tuesday to an already packed house, but were able to somehow score a table outside without a reservation (but you should make one, seriously).  Typical Meat & Potatoes, Butcher & the Rye service:  hoverish without being annoying, super helpful.  We had a slew of staff bring us menus, some fine tap, and had our drink orders taken before I could even look at the \"make your own guacamole\" sheet.  Unfortunately I'm not a guac fan, but it was a really cute idea that you get to fill out this scan-tron menu of traditional and a little bizarre options that come with a box of incredible looking chips.  The special (dollar off) frozen margarita was apple so I jumped on that instantly while +1 opted for a mango Jarritos.  We started with the papa bravas to start which were these confit lil' potatoes in garlic red sauce and a bit of cheese in a silver bowl of my new favorite thing.  I was barely done woofing them down when my pollo asado tacos came up.  Spicy but not hot chicken cooled with avocado and white cheese crumbles.  Somehow the best part were the tender (and really sturdy!!) shells. Pretty traditional compared to other options; the +1 played it safe but spicy too getting the al pastor tacos which were gone before I could even see what was in them--caught a glimpse of beef and pineapple. They were a hit with him.  And not to get tacky, but everything was priced well too.  I actually took one of my tacos home (and not just because I filled up on tequila!).  I grabbed a passion fruit margarita before heading out.  Super sweet but just as good as the apple, although not as unique.  Their frozen margaritas, by the way, are perfect.  Nothing syrupy and heavy on the booze. I really wanted to try the lychee, but I could not have more than two of these guys.  More importantly, I also need a reason to come back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I got my hands (and mouth) on some very delicious fish tacos here. I love a good fried fish taco as long as it's not greasy and this one was done well. Flavors were on point and the tortilla was fantastic! It's kind of a bummer that you can't mix and match tacos, but that problem can be solved by going with someone who likes to swap/share.   I love the atmosphere. It's loud and lively and dark and a little steam-punkish (check out the bike gear chandelier- it's amazing!) Our server was really great and was able to give some helpful drink recommendations based off of preferences.   This would have been a five star experience if it weren't for dessert. Let me preface by saying that I will eat almost anything that contains sugar. I have a sweet tooth that rivals an elementary school student. But the dessert was... just not good. I couldn't even get half way through it. I ordered the whipped cheesecake with bananas foster and brownie brittle topping. \"Whipped cheesecake\" essentially equates to taking all the ingredients of a cheesecake, minus the crust, and putting it in a blender. It was rich (too rich) and creamy but the temp and texture just made it feel like I was eating sweet cream cheese that was sitting out too long. The bananas were good but just added more mush on top of mush. The brownie bits couldn't even save it.   Next time, I'll pass on dessert and just do drinks and tacos!"}
{"text":"Made reservations well in advance and ended up worst table in the place.Food is way overrated. Where I come from 6\" tortilla isn't exactly huge. Chicken taco extremely hot. Overall I would not recommend"}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent.  Big flavors and dessert was a big treat with a yuca parfait of sorts.  We ordered the 'tako' taco ;)."}
{"text":"This is now on my list of favorite spots.  I do suggest you make a reservation since the place has limited seating and a small bar area.  There is seating outside in good weather. I ordered the Korean Short Rib Tacos and they were absolutely scrumptious.  Crispy sweet and spicy rib with slaw, cucumber and fresh cilantro.   They have a full bar with plenty of mixed drinks, beer & wine. The service was stellar and very friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable. I will eat at this place until I have eaten everything on the menu, YEAH... it is that good. ** I did not feel the need to take any pictures since it would just be repetitive as, there are many for this restaurant.  I will say that my tacos looked just like the ones in the posted pics."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Love the Mexican corn..a def fave of mine! A little loud for my liking, def not the place to go if you want to have a conversation with your guests! Otherwise, love the food!"}
{"text":"Awesome craft tacos and unbelievable tequila selections! I never had octopus until we decided to live on the wild side.. all I can say is wow!   I hope you can expand your Downtown seating sometime (or open in the South Hills). We would visit more often if the RSVP waiting list wasn't 2-3 weeks out.   You're our special treat downtown and at the PPG Paints arena (when we can get in the club seats)!"}
{"text":"It is the place I have been in Pittsburgh!! I love their customization avocado. Also the nice atmosphere reminds me of \"sex and the city\" TV series about girls hanging out in those chic restaurants. Love it and I will definitely bring friends there in the future."}
{"text":"Great first experience. Took my boyfriend for his birthday which Is on cinco de mayo. I knew it would be a popular day so I made reservations two months in advance. I had heard nothing but good things about this spot. Everything was tasty that we ordered. It is a small and very busy place but still worth a trip.   We got the quseo dip recommended by the waiter and other yelp reviews. I had the chicken taco and my man had the pork Taco with pineapples. We had to wait for the blood orange margarita but was very very good.  The waiters Jason and Chelsea are great might I add."}
{"text":"Two words- The Tako-tako, Americas best taco well earned! As an aficionado of octopus this dish sets the standard! The tentacle is so texturally perfect in its preparation and lovingly balanced in the chewy tortilla..."}
{"text":"We went here for a special occasion and it was a great way to celebrate. The food lived up to the hype and the mixed drinks were amazing."}
{"text":"Ok! I finally got my Funnel Cake!!! On Friday I visited this hip and trendy atmosphere! It was a packed house and reservations are HIGHLY recommended and there's a good reason why!  The dessert I had was outstanding and filling. The wait staff was friendly and upbeat. The establishment is small but has 2 levels and is equipped with a bar that seats about 15 comfortably.   If you are looking to experience Tako on a weekend I would strongly recommend getting their upon opening to get your preferred seating or a space at the bar.   Also on my visit the DJ was energized and amazing!   This place does not disappoint; it's the first of many visits for me! Go! And share your experience with me!"}
{"text":"I would rate tako four and a half stars.  The tacos here are quite the opposite of Las Palmas. Las Palmas are known for cheap and simple tacos. The tacos here are pricey yet quite crafty. The menu features tacos with influences from all over the world. I shared the signature tako taco with my girlfriend. The octopus was cooked perfectly. The other ingredients in the taco complimented the octopus very well.  In addition to tacos, we also shared the tuna tartar and the customized guacamole. There was a bit too much cucumber garnishing the tartar. The cucumber was cut very thin giving it a crispy yet soft texture. Nevertheless, I'd recommend the tartar. The guacamole was very tasteful too. I liked that they offered many ingredients to put in your guacamole which I never would have thought of."}
{"text":"When we arrived at 545, we assumed we would have no problem getting a table. However, they *only* take reservations and have no open tables just for walkins. However, after about 30 mins we were able to get a seat at the bar.   Drinks: Ordered spicy cucumber and strawberry margaritas. If I had to choose one, it would be the spicy cucumber, but both were amazing.  Food: We got the chips and salsa for an appetizer and it was very good. They give you a huge amount of chips and the salsa is very good (the hot was meh). We ordered chicken tacos and the Korean. Both were absolutely delicious, and totally changed my idea of what a restaurant taco is.  Verdict: Would return 100x over, but would make sure I had a reservation first."}
{"text":"We waited a bit for an outside table since it was nice out. Nice view of the open kitchen right out in the street.   My girlfriend and I each ordered a frozen margarita but the machine was broken. We got some non-frozen variations instead. A grapefruit and sage margarita, which had the right amount of savoriness and bitterness to counter the usual citrus sweetness. My girlfriend's sake margarita was a beautiful fuchsia color and tasted great.   We split some \"build your own guacamole\" with radish and pepitas. Nice crunch and we loved the tiny sliced chilies dotting the bowl.   We also split some tacos which come 2 per order. The duck confit tacos, topped with hoisin, chiles, pickled cucumber/cauliflower, mint and cilantro. Each ingredient contributed to a crazy savory/sweet, hot/cool, cooked/raw combination of flavors and textures. The carnitas tacos were our favorite. Tender, juicy braised pork shoulder with crispy bits, avocado, salsa verde, onions, and a crispy strip of chicharron on top. These were packed with juicy flavor. Super rich meat, cut with the acid from the salsa verde. A must order!! The tortillas were nice and chewy, we saw them making them in the kitchen (to order?).  We split some chocolate mouse cake for dessert after deciding we didn't have room for more tacos (but had room for dessert). It was super rich, and not too sweet, thumbs up.  I kind of wish the tacos came 3 per order (smaller sized tacos) or were smaller but a few dollars cheaper, allowing for more easy sharing. I would have loved to try a few more tacos but between the two of us we only had room for 2 tacos each."}
{"text":"Love the food and overall decor. If you get the chance, sit outside at the bar that faces the kitchen. You can watch your food being prepared. The tacos come in pairs, so if you are hungry I suggest getting an appetizer as well."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout so I can speak only so much about the ambiance and service. I did wait about 15-20 minutes for my food to be prepared which wasn't bad at all considering I didn't order ahead.   - ambiance seems interesting and familiar. I could definitely grab a bite and cocktail in the future.   - service was pretty quick and the bartender gave me a glass of water without my asking.   - on to the FOOD. I ordered the Korean without peanuts or pickled cabbage. It was amazing. Easily the best taco I've ever had. The pork was cooker perfectly, the balance of flavor was delicate but pronounced, and the taco shell, soft and definitely homemade, was exquisite."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. At first glance it might look pricey for two tacos but they do not skimp out on loading them up. The pineapple jalopeño margarita I had was very well made too. It is very very crowded and can be hard to get a seat but I would say worth it. Personally I would eat here over the butcher and the rye any day"}
{"text":"tako is worth the wait! I've had great time every time I've been to the cultural district restaurant. Usually with a group of friends, we have used the online reservation system to be sure we have a seat. The upstairs seating is private and fun - with booths big enough for our party of 6.  I allowed others to take the lead on ordering, so we had a variety of takos. The Chicken was my favorite, with great flavor and delicious corn tortillas. They also have a variety of bar drinks -- good beer list, mixed drinks, and my go-to for the night was a Moscow Mule. Great option.  I also like that they have the outdoor bar for nice weather seating. I haven't been lucky enough to grab a seat there, but it looks great having a direct view into the kitchen to watch the magic happen. Hopefully when summer comes around again I'll find my self bellied up to the bar with a taco in hand!"}
{"text":"Trendy and expensive. But the food is pretty good.   Had the al pastor and thought it was a bit too salty. The duck confit was flavorful."}
{"text":"Täk? used to be close to #1 as far as Pittsburgh restaurants go, however it's tough to accommodate a vegan. Still they make the absolute BEST margarita in the city limits. Seriously fresh as can be, with every single ingredient made from scratch. And not loaded with artificial sugar. These are margaritas I can sip on and enjoy. The menu is always changing, with new items popping up monthly. You can never go wrong with their guacamole, and be sure to try all their house-made hot sauces --all a little different but so fresh and packing the perfect punch. Was sad when I found out their in-house flour taco shells are made with lard. Fortunately they have a vegan/gluten free corn shell to substitute with. They are able to accommodate a vegan with the mushroom taco, but you must omit the kale slaw, aioli, and substitute the corn shell. Waiter looked at me like I had three heads as I ordered - not running back here to spend my money."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we came at a time when it was so packed. Telling us it was going to be an hour wait, but we were so determined to get in. And man was it worth it, we got the street corn along with chorizo tacos. BOTH WERE INCREDIBLE. Definitely a bit more pricey than we were planning on spending but trust me, it's such a unique spot. The music they have going kept me sticking around to be honest. The only complaint I have is that we couldn't help but feel Unwelcome. People that worked there could care less about us, we got lots of ugly stares. The owner personally got us a table (after we were told we couldn't get in, he literally just made it happen) which was very kind. Everything else was amazing, and honestly people are the least of my worries... but that's just me (which is why the 5 stars are still there)."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that I had very high expectations for this restaurant before visiting after hearing only good things about it. Let me tell you, all of those expectations were blown away. When we first walked in, the first thing I noticed was the loud music, but the decor was spectacular! The malaria as were delicious, nut the food was really the star of our meal.  The täk? tacos (octopus) were our favorite dish, followed closely by the Korean tacos and the poke (which included some of their delicious guacamole!). The server was very helpful and friendly. We were surprised by how quickly the food arrived at our table. Overall awesome meal, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Way over rated!  Food and drinks were mediocre at best.  Given how long I had to wait for a reservation, I should really give it a single star."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! The staff was perfectly attentive and the food was amazing! We had the Baja Fish Tacos and I had the Watermelon Basil Margarita. I also loved the music! We will definitely go back if we can get a reservation! We booked this one a month in advance."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner this past year and had heard a LOT about and reservations are tough to make. So, when we had a table reserved at 10 that night, I was excited. Music is loud but not TOO loud, drinks are good and the food...is exceptional. They serve tacos and Guac, so, there's not much left to the imagination...or so I thought. The tacos we ordered are not terribly priced (10 bucks for 2 tacos - they're rather filling) and MAN were they incredible. They're put together like a speciality chef would only assemble, and the Guac. Let's talk about Guac...I honestly can't. There are no words to describe how good the guac there was - actually there is! I can explain it in one sentence. We ordered a bowl of Guac and ate it so fast I ordered another. If you're reading this, you should go."}
{"text":"I have been trying to get a reservation at a normal time at Tako every so often over the past few years and have never been able to. It's always been on my list to try, but they never have tables available OR if they do, it's at 11PM. I was determined to go there this weekend, so I check the reservations - nothing available. I decided to call, and they had a table available at 10PM. What surprised me the most was that when we got there, there were several tables open upstairs and downstairs during our entire meal.   Overall, the food was good, drinks were small (I think I got like, 4 ounces of sangria for $8), prices were high, service was quick and music was SO loud. Definitely don't recommend bringing your parents here. Will we go again? Maybe, but not likely.   We got the Papas Bravas appetizer which is honestly one of the better starters I've had in Pittsburgh. SO good, and easy to split between 2-4 people depending on your hunger level.   I got the Al Pastor tacos while my fiance got the Bistec. Both were good portions, but expensive. $31 for four tacos? My expectations were high. The Al Pastor had great flavor, but the saltiness was unbelievable. Granted, I am not a salt lover, but I had to chug 4 glasses of water to get through these. My fiance agreed, and he loves salt. If this salt level is normal, I recommend putting more pineapple on. The Bistec was good, but simply not worth $19."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and this place was a block away from my hotel. The al pastor tacos were amazing!  I went around 5PM, so I was expecting to have to wait long for service, and that wasn't the case. There were a lot of people, but the service was fast and efficient.  If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"While I don't know exactly how to pronounce this restaurant's name (is it just taco or something fancier?), the food was phenomenal. I guess you have to have reservations, but we were lucky enough that the outdoor street seating was available. Although I would have liked to see all the cool octopus décor on the inside, we had a great view of the kitchen from the street. It was like a live viewing of MasterChef! I am in love with the job of being \"guacamole girl,\" where you just make people's custom guacamoles all night long with the perfectly-prepped ingredients! And yes, the guacamole was delish! Along with the Korean bulgogi tacos!! Or takos, I mean..."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here before a Steeler game. It was wonderful! Erica waited on us and did a great job desiring the menu, this being our first time. Erica's service was attentive and helpful but not intrusive and the place was packed. I had the el Diablo margherita and my wife had wine to start and we had the street corn and papa bravas apps. Would recommend both, but the papa bravas was my fav of the two. It was hard to pick the tacos we would order, but settled on the Korean and Baja and shared them. Again, both were delicious, but the Korean was the over the top. An order is two tacos, but don't think that's not enough. They are packed. We could not order dessert because we were so stuffed, but the next table had some wonderful looking desserts! Everything is fresh and really good. Check was 65 bucks with tax. Not bad for the quality and amount of food you get! We'll be back next time we are in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"atmosphere is fantastic!  food is to die for.  margaritas pure deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Very modern and relaxed atmosphere. It was cool how you could see into the kitchen and watch the cooks make the food. Our server, Damian was very helpful and attentive. Food was phenomenal, deff go with the Al Pastor tacos."}
{"text":"It took me months to get a reservation for two here. We came with anticipation. This place is very eclectic. Expect dark, cramped quarters. The menu is very creative with multiple different types of chip dips and tacos. Our food was delicious and we left satisfied. Despite a reasonably nice dinner, I can't say this place lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Chorizo Taco What a delicious spin on a taco. It's topped with a fried egg, although it was more sunny side up than fried. It was delicious! Great heat spices and a tad sweetness with (I think) the peppers.   Chicken Taco Delicious as well. No special additions to this one. It was a tad spicer than I had expected.   Tres Leche Cake Adding strawberries was a nice touch. The cake had a nice cinnamon and cardamom hint to it.   I didn't particularly like the carnitas Taco. Carnitas was dry and the flavor was kind of off to me. It could've been the other flavors were too bold and blocked the carnitas one? This is the only reason I gave it one less star.   Go early, I went around 8pm and there was an hour wait for couples. Fortunately being single paid off, as I found a single seat at the bar. :-)"}
{"text":"Was in from out of town and read the great Yelp reviews so decided to walk over and try it out. Really cool atmosphere and great music (although a bit loud for conversation). Was seated right away at the bar at 9pm on a Tuesday night. Had the pepper and pistachio tuna tacos from the special menu. Flavor and texture was perfection although 2 tacos for $14 was a bit on the high side to me. Bartender was attentive so would give service 5 stars. Would try again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Everything these guys do turns to gold!  Its very tough to get in, but once you do the atmosphere is eclectic and fun.  Fantastic tequila selection. Good margaritas. Solid chips/salsa and outstanding street corn.  I take a star off only because some of the tacos could use a bit more sauce/flavor/seasoning to go with the superior fresh ingredients.  Liked the duck confit the most. Pricing is very reasonable considering they could get away with more on their reputation."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends and it was such a great experience. Not only was the ambiance great, the food was fantastic. I have never had such a creative menu for tacos! You must try to octopus tacos because they have the best combination and soft and crunchy. But for the taco traditionalists, don't be scared as they have traditional tacos too! Pricey for tacos, but well worth the experience!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Buffalo and wanted to try something new... well the place is amazing.... the drinks are great... but the takos were on a different level... the place was packed"}
{"text":"Täk? was my first stop once arriving in Pittsburgh. The ambiance was wonderful...what a cool looking little place! I was sold immediately. The papas bravas were amazing to start, I then moved on to the carnitas tacos and was in love!! The cocktails were delicious, and I especially enjoyed the Ramon's Gin Fizz.  Also, I would like to point out that once asked, the staff went out of their way to assure my boyfriend and I that they used canola oil and not peanut oil in their cooking. Can't beat that kind of customer service. I would certainly come here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and atmosphere! If you've never experienced this place..MAke a reservation today!!!"}
{"text":"One of the few places where I can say everything we ate was great! Excellent food, drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was fun! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for the first time on Friday. All six of us loved it and already can't wait to go back. We started off with drinks and the guacamole. I had the spicy cucumber margarita for my first drink and spicy passion fruit margarita as my second. Both were equally delicious. The guacamole was so good that we actually ordered a second one. I had the scallop taco special and it was amazing. They should make it a staple on their regular menu. The service was great and so was the atmosphere. My only complaint is that it was really dark in there. Can't wait for my next trip there so I can try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"This was my first time here - great atmosphere. Margarita was made to perfection. The mushroom taco was unbelievably delicious. Only problem is that it's a little to dark, but everything else made up for that."}
{"text":"Four stars for good food and good service. Not five stars because it is a tad overpriced for what you get. We really didn't love any of the drinks (we tried four) and they were ten dollars each. I loved the steak (bistec) tacos and the Korean. My husband loved the fish tacos (Baja). The street corn was amazing and the salsas were just okay. The hot salsa was just hotness and tomato flavor. The verde and mild had much better flavor. Very difficult to get into and get a reservation. We called a week in advanced and still could not get a reservation. We showed up 20 minutes before they opened and got in line. Yes, there was a line. We got seats at the bar as soon as they opened and after sitting down, the restaurant was already full. Glad we got to try it and will go back eventually, but will probably try this restaurant groups other places first. I feel this place is good, but just a little overhyped."}
{"text":"Expect to be skeptical because of the fusion food!! But nothing that me and the boo ate wasn't good. Even the margaritas were yumm! Loves the ambiance and the tacos were great. Favorite has to be the one with chorizos."}
{"text":"My father made reservations for 7 people a few weeks in advance. The earliest they could seat us was 11:00pm. So we treated it as a late night snack, rather than dinner. When we arrived the hostess said we could only have 6 people at a table. She didn't know why someone would have made a reservation for 7, so they weren't very thrilled. Luckily, after a short wait, they seated us all in an upstairs booth, with a chair on the end. It was honestly nice for them to still accommodate us, since that's not restaurant protocol.   Side note: I'm not sure why the earliest reservation was 11pm, since the upstairs was totally empty. So that was a little annoying to know we could have been there much earlier and actually had a nice dinner. Clearly whoever made the reservation didn't know what they were doing.  They had a DJ playing (also upstairs) and it was so loud! We couldn't really talk to each other and our waiter (who was awesome) couldn't hear our orders very well. It was so dark that we used our flashlight apps to read the menu, more of a joke, than a necessity, but it still made it 1000x easier. I loved the way the menu was presented, on newspaper paper. Despite how loud it was, I loved the dark vibe. The decor is so cool, octopus theme, low red lighting, and so unique to Pittsburgh. Another place that made me feel like I was in some real-life TrueBlood scene, if only you replaced the vampires on the show with octopus.   When it came to the food, I ordered the Baja fish tacos to share and a Pineapple Jalapeno Margarita. Also we shared an order of guacamole. Not sure what kind we had, since I couldn't hear them order.  Honestly, the food was amazing!! Best fish tacos in the city, end of story. I expect to come back here within the next month if I can stand to wait that long."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and sat on the outside bar stools, giving us a great view of the chefs in action. I had a killer mezcal cocktail. I wasn't surprised that I loved it, as the cocktail program here is run by cocktail guru Maggie Meskey (formerly at Butcher & The Rye).  I really enjoyed the ambience, everything from music to the bustling crowd (which is usually not a plus - but somehow here it is) to the aesthetic. The vibe is also quite different indoors vs. out. Sitting indoors feels more hip and vibrant - like a real mexican taqueria meets club. Outdoors is more relaxed, and if you manage to snag a bar seat, watching the cooking unfold is a real pleasure.  We had two taco orders, the chorizo and the al pastor.  The tacos are high-quality, but I am not sure those specific ones we had lived up to the general hype of the restaurant.  Though I appreciated the fresh-made quality of the flour tortillas, the texture had a grittiness that I didn't prefer (for reference, I think the best homemade tortillas are at SMOKE Taqueria).  The al pastor tacos were pretty good, with inventive flavors that really worked well together.  I'd love to come back and try the carnitas -- my usual go-to taco.  But the real highlight of our meal were the patatas bravas.  If you like patatas bravas (or potatos and spicy food), GET THIS DISH.  They were the best I've ever had, ever.  Including patatas bravas I had in Madrid and Barcelona.  The spicy tomato sauce is absolutely to DIE for, and the aioli is a perfect complement.  I will be back for cocktails and more patatas bravas.  I'd love to try some of their other tacos next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I loved the Papas Bravas and the Korean tacos.  The atmosphere is great for a date.  You usually need a reservation on the weekend.  The margaritas are also delicious.  However, they used to have a margarita \"Aloe & Elderflower\" and it was the best flavored margarita I've ever had!! Please bring it back!!"}
{"text":"I liked service i liked the drink i got. I ordered duck taco in which I found hair while I was eating.... I felt so bad, found hair when bite taco yaaak..."}
{"text":"It is a great place for delicious tacos, tried many and they were all super.  what funky décor, it's really fun."}
{"text":"Tako has become one of my favorite restaurants since they have opened. Their food is always consistent. I recommend trying one of the specials for the day. The cocktails are unique and the tequila selection is unbelievable."}
{"text":"It was our first time in Pittsburg and we wanted to experience the nightlife and eat somewhere \"different\".  The yelp reviews really help to make our decision.  It was also within walking distance from our hotel. Upon arrival we were pleased to find it not \"average and ordinary\"! There was a slight mix up with our waiting for a table outside but the hostesses immediately found us one inside.  Jacen was our server and was awesome!!!  He took such great care of us, explained the menu and how it all worked!  The food came out quickly, fresh, hot and was F A N T A S T I C !  We had the chefs special guacamole with crab, mango, cilantro and jalapeño. The tortilla chips came out fresh, hot and perfect!  I had the skirt steak taco and Tammy had the chicken taco. They were exceptional.  Highly recommend this place for a great dinner and experience.  Thanks to Jacen!!!"}
{"text":"Came around 5:30pm on a Sun night and went straight to the bar where there was no wait. I was not hungry at all after a late lunch but felt inclined to partake because of a friend's recommendation to come here. Ordered the mushroom tacos because the word *truffle* was listed in the description, and they were delicious. However, as much as these tacos were packed with ingredients, they are damn expensive. $12-18 for 2 tacos?? I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore so not sure if this is reasonable but I've gotten similar quality tacos in other cities for a third or a half of the price. Everything else on the menu (guacamole, drinks, etc) seemed priced comparatively for a Mexican restaurant though, but the name of this place is tako, so you should be prepared to get some (pricey) tacos."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Went on a Tuesday night, they were busy but we had reservations and were seated immediately.  The waiter was professional and took care of things, but was a little overwhelmed, but the other staff and management seemed in sync and helped cover each other to ensure a good experience.  I had the spicy cucumber cocktail which was off the hook, and a great combination of ingredients.  Mexican street corn appitizer was delicious, Tako taco was great, and the octopus was cooked better and more tender than any octopus i've ever had.  Pollo asado taco was very good also, chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly, more traditional taco than to tako.  Also had the special Bo saam taco which wasn't bad, but the kimchi really overpowered the whole dish and couldn't taste the fried oyster or pork shoulder. Being that it was a special item, and still tasted good, didn't feel necessary to go down a star.  Will be back soon!  (Side note: restaurant was noted as not kid friendly, but if you're little one is not a picky eater and well behaved, you'll be fine, our daughter enjoyed the experience as well!)"}
{"text":"Overpriced tacos eaten in the dark with loud music. No need to hurry back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch in party of 6 with a reservation at 3:30pm on Sunday. Highly recommend making your reservation early if you want more time options. There's not much seating inside and the lighting is very dim. The service was not great, as we received two dirty plates that we had to exchange and only 3 hot towels for all six of us. We ordered a ceviche for starters, which was $12 and contained a single slide of avocado with a few pieces of fish. It tasted alright, but wasn't anything special. We also ordered wings, which were more reasonably priced and tasted pretty good. For tacos, we ordered the big board, which contains 6 orders of tacos (so 12 total) for $78. I had one of the pollo asada and one of the chorizo taco. The chorizo one was a good balance of sweet and spicy and the yolk in the fried egg was silky. Overall the flavor and texture was pretty good. The chicken taco was alright but very average. My friends really liked the Korean taco. Our biggest critique was how overly priced nearly everything on the menu was and our experience was quite disappointing given our high expectations going in."}
{"text":"After months of talking about going to täk? with my fiancé, we finally were able to get reservations for a Friday night at 7:15. We both were so excited to finally experience all the hype surrounding täk?. We arrived right on time and immediately seated at our table. I was already impressed by the vibe and decor of the restaurant. We both ordered drinks and put in our appetizer order while we tried to figure out the difficult task of which tacos to order. I ordered the Violet Pilot and she ordered the Watermelon Basil Margarita. I thoroughly enjoyed my drink. It wasn't too sweet, and I could really taste the smokiness of the mezcal at the end. (I love to try variations of drinks that have egg whites as an ingredient). She was happy with her margarita as well.  We ordered the Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was a tough decision between that or the Papa Bravas. The Queso Fundido was a great choice and I would definitely consider ordering it again. It came with four little tortillas. It was a great combination of cheese and chorizo and all the flavors were a great start to an amazing meal.  Now onto my favorite part of the meal and what I was most anticipating: the tacos. I ordered the Chorizo and she ordered the Baja. (She tends to never to be able to finish her meal, so I was excited and looking forward to trying both kinds of tacos). These tacos were hands down the best I've ever had. The Chorizo tacos blew my mind and I enjoyed every single bite! I loved how they incorporated a fried egg on the taco; the yolk added a lot of extra flavor! As anticipated, she was full and gave me her last Baja taco. It was very flavorful! I feel that the slaw on the taco brought all the flavors together and it was a nice touch. However, the Chorizo taco was definitely my favorite so far! I can't wait to come back to try all the other varieties that they have to offer!  Our bill came out to be $60 (plus tip) for two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. I felt our meal was definitely worth the cost. Yes, it can get pricey quick and I see how everyone says it can be expensive.  täk? is now one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are AMAZING! Relaxed ambience!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent but think this place should be a tapas restaurant instead of a taco shop. To me, 4 of the 6 taco options we had didn't seem to have to be in a tortilla. The fillings were great but the taco aspect just seems forced since the restaurant is called täko. Also I didn't like the chorizo. So mushy..."}
{"text":"täk? is a modern, hip restaurant located in the Cultural District. What appears to be a regular taco place on the outside, is actually a gem in Pittsburgh that's gain lots of traction. The location itself is in a wonderfully bustling part of the city, which brings together a diverse crowd. I made reservations here about a month before my two friends and I dined here and scheduled a time during the week (a Thursday night). We thought there wouldn't be that many people, but the restaurant was busy. Initially, I thought that the restaurant only had one floor of seating, but there's a lovely second floor that's a lot quieter and has comfortable, spacious booths. Though it was a bit loud, my friends and I could still hold a conversation without bordering on yelling. My friends and I decided to order the \"Build Your Own Guac\" as an appetizer and mixed in smoked salmon, green onions, and white onions. The guac was delicious, even with such unusual ingredients, so definitely experiment! A huge highlight of our night were the chips. They were addicting, so it was hard to stop mindlessly munching on them so that we'd have room for our actual meals. My boyfriend and I shared the Korean, Al Pastor, and Bistec tacos. Hands down, the best was the Al Pastor. The flavors were classic mexican but with a fun, unique twist. The Korean and Bistec tacos were good, but my boyfriend and I thought they were a bit too salty. A few little extra tidbits about täk?: parking is definitely easy, since there are lots everywhere, service is extremely efficient but never overbearing, and reservations are definitely necessary. Overall, täk? is an awesome place to have a great meal and drinks with friends and it's a place any foodie should experience."}
{"text":"This place is YUMMY! A friend and I made our own guacamole ( yes you pick the ingredients!), I had the fish taco and chicken taco ( we split) as well as their daily margarita special. Everything was fresh and fantastic. The atmosphere is very cool as well! It can be difficult to get a table/reservation, but it is WELL WORTH the wait! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I heard there were morel mushroom tacos on the menu and I went the next day to try them. They have crunchy tempura-ish asparagus, ramps, morels, and goat cheese. I added their homemade Arbol sauce which has a sweet and spicy flavor. I was worried that the goat cheese would be overpowering, but the tacos were delicious! I'll definitely return to try them again before the menu changes. I ordered the cilantro cocktail to start and I would definitely recommend it. It wasn't too sweet if you're not into that. This is the third time I've been to tako and this I definitely made the best taco choice."}
{"text":"There are no words--so unbelievably good!!! Great service, amazing drinks and awesome bartenders/staff! Can't ask for much more!!!!! Always my go to!!!!"}
{"text":"It was everything we hoped it would be. Excellent service and incredible food.   We went with our best friends to celebrate our wedding anniversary and everything about our visit was perfect. Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and the food was incredible.   There's a reason why this place is hard to get into, but persevere and make it happen. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"First and foremost the staff here are awesome and you can't teach awesome. The food is impeccable. I had the chicken tacos and they were packed with authentic Mexican flavor.  The atmosphere is one of a kind and the music is a great selection.  I would recommend booking a reservation as the line was already long when the doors opened. It was like lining up to go the club. I would also recommend that you try their Sangria because it's to die for. I will be back with all my friends because this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Maybe the best chicken taco I've ever had. But the wait was very long for tacos. I ordered Togo and waited for over 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Pricy. Good but pricy. Every single taco was good but pricy. You need to have reservations. 2 h wait on a school night..."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. From the friendly service (cheers to you Damien) to the excellent food (the tako taco was a personal favorite), this restaurant is just amazing. I went with a group of 4 so we were able to get a good cross section of the menu. We started with the poke, thrice cooked wings, and the daily special meat lover nachos. Not only were the portions large and filling (the nachos alone could feed an army!), the flavors were intense. Damien our server recommended combining all the sauces and fish for the poke and the suggestion took the flavors to a whole new level. Just thinking about it, I'm drooling. For our main courses, we sampled the carnitas, al pastor, chorizo, Korean, bistec, baja, and my personal favorite tako tacos. As strange as it sounds to have an octopus taco, the flavors were explosive! Each taco had its own personal flair that made it impossible to compare. But the consensus of the table was that there just wasn't a bad taco. Each was spectacular. For dessert, we had the tapioca with passionfruit sorbet (I wanted to take home a gallon of the sorbet because it was so amazing), the churro with in-house prepared ice cream (a delicious treat), and a cheesecake so fluffy, I couldn't believe it.   The meal was a flavorful roller coaster from start to finish, and if I wasn't so stuffed, I'd get back in line right away. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Omg. Can I start by saying I am in love w this place. I'm from Denver, and there is a spot in Denver that reminds me of this place. Not this awesome tho!  The atmosphere is amazing! Jay the hostess is just fabulous, I can't help but want to hang out w him! The service and the bartenders are just 5 STARS! Try the steak tacos, duck, Korean, carnitas! I will always come back here every time!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering tacos. I had a margarita and it was fresh and delicious. The ambiance is awesome as well and the theme is consistent and fun."}
{"text":"Very unique and innovative Mexican Food.  Fresh and ideas \"outside the box\" are all part of a delicious and I think healthful dining experience."}
{"text":"We went late night but were lucky enough to get a table right off the bat. Tako is very busy, so if you are looking to check it out...make a reservation. We found out about it when we went to Butcher and the Rye and we were so glad- they are both owner by the same company.   Their appetizers and dessert are extremely good, fresh, high in flavor and all about balance in spice/heat. Decor is fun, trendy and the music was upbeat and fun.  We wents a few weeks back so I don't know the exact name of what we got but the corn appetizer was amazing and I really enjoyed the ahi tuna and pico dish. Really good experience and will go back any chance we get."}
{"text":"It is well established that it is a funky industrial cool decor and interesting cuisine.  It is dark with load music playing.  Great service.  Our waiter was outstanding.   Some interesting drinks and a fun bartender.  I had the red sangria with lots of fresh fruit. Better than my own.  SWMBO had a margarita and was truly satisfied.  We started with a build your own guac that had some bacon and blue cheese and a few other items.  Really good, the blue cheese worked well with the sweet guac and the bacon!  Really good chips too!     We spit our taco orders since you get 2 tacos. The Mushroom with garlic aioli and truffle salsa with brussel sprouts was the better of the two and very good.  The Korean with wagyu short rib, peanuts, napa cabbage and cilantro was OK.  The cilantro and seasoning gave it a nice flavor and a little heat but some of the short rib was over grilled/charred to a crisp. Unfortunately due to the over grilling some of the meat was tasteless and hard to eat. Will definitely go back some time to try some other items on the menu.  The price of the meal and drinks seems to follow a local trend, where probably a little pricey for what you get, but still overall a good meal and good place to enjoy the cuisine."}
{"text":"The ambience was very red and dark although it was fitting.  I went here with a friend for drinks. Not really my future go to for an after hour wind down.  The food was really good though.  To be honest, the bathroom was my favorite part of the experience!  The art was so entertaining and there was a cool hand scrub when you went to wash your hands   We had the duck and Korean tacos which were both so amazing. I was pretty full after.  Their tequila list was extensive.  I didn't like that I paid 14 dollars for one shot (Patron), but in comparison to the other tequilas it was a steal.   You COULD NOT get a table.   They were \"reserved\" but we got there at 5 and one table wasn't occupied until nearly six.  Mind you, they only had a handful of tables.  Sitting at the bar was equally satisfying.    I do like this place but the tab just wasn't that exciting and for that reason I only give it a 4."}
{"text":"This place is seriously AWESOME. I first heard about it when I was home and interning in NYC for the summer (I go to school in Pittsburgh) and my supervisor went to Tako while doing business in Pittsburgh. So, it's safe to say that Tako was on the top of my list of places to try when coming back to school.  The abidance itself is a little dark, however it does remind me of something inspired by trendy NYC restaurants. The seating is a little uncomfortable- I am not a fan of seats without backings and the stools are not the most comfortable, but I digress.  The queso is a must-try... trust me. It comes with chorizo in it and it's just out of this world. It's served with warm tortillas, the same ones used for their tacos, however when those run out I simply use my fork, because the queso is THAT good.   I have tried an array of the tacos, and I think my favorite is the Korean taco. The flavor and combination of ingredients just really wowed me. I also enjoyed the Tako tako (grilled octopus) and though I have to be in the mood for grilled octopus, it was very flavorful and had a slight spice factor to it. The duck taco was also good, and same with the fish taco and al pastor taco, however these were not my favorites.   The food service is speedy and the tacos are of very good quality. This is one of my favorite places to go while at school when wanting to splurge a little bit on good food. If you find yourself in Pittsburgh, Tako is a must-try."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York. Brilliant decor. Great service! From the hosts to the servers."}
{"text":"Good variety, attentive service and great food. The cocktails were also excellent. The only criticism I had, was that our server seemed to pass judgement on the amount of food we ordered. Oh well."}
{"text":"Tako was wonderful. The combination of ingredients in the tacos melded together perfectly to make the taste incredible. It is a place that we will return and try some different tacos."}
{"text":"Assuming you are into tacos, this is the place to get them in Pittsburgh. The taco size and filling amounts are spot on and their guac is on point. Good cocktails, but the bar is tiny and being attached to Butcher in the Rye helps if you want a post-dinner drink. Make a reservation, this place is almost impossible to walk into and sit down at a table without one."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Decor: 4 Service: 3  Came here 3 times over the past year.  1. STREET CORN, 6 sriracha mayo / chili / lime / cotija cheese ~Really good.  2. POKE, 14 big eye tuna / seaweed / spicy soy dressing / whipped lime / rice crackers ~Really good.  3. AL PASTOR, 12 grilled pork shoulder / roasted pineapple / white onion / avocado salsa / cilantro ~Pretty good. One of the better tacos.  4. BAJA, 12 tempura white fish / jalapeno lime aioli / white cabbage slaw / cilantro ~Pretty good.  5. GUACAMOLE, 15 ~Really good. Make your own guac. We added several toppings, including crab and corn.  Service is okay, a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! The Tako taco was our favorite but I'd highly recommend everything we ordered, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The meal here was absolutely delicious. We were so happy to be able to get a reservation at a reasonable time having heard that you have to wait 2 weeks to get in here. My friend and I arrived a couple of minutes late but were greeted warmly. There was one high top for 2 available and it was ours!! I had a classic margarita and i was not disappointed. We ordered guacamole. There was a guac menu that you could add all kind of stuff but we chose the basic. Chips were amazing- fresh and crunchy but guac was spicier than I expected even after asking. Beyond that.... amazing Korean tacos- tender steak and lots of veggies and spices.. yummy . My friend had the salmon tacos and cleaned her plate..mmmm good!!! We actually ordered dessert. Got tres leches. I'm not a fan but loved it with the fruit. I would recommend to anyone. Would be. 5 if the guac was just a little more traditional. Just my taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely love food. And so do you, that's why you're reading these reviews isn't it? As a reservation is not easily had, plan to go on the early or late end and it's a short wait for the bar that serves full menu and spot on cocktails. Take the grapefruit sage margaritas for example. So damn drinkable it's a bit frightening.   Pair that with exquisite cuisine, it's entirely next level. The place made such an impression we were back two nights after our initial visit before we had to skip town. We thoroughly enjoyed sampling their creations, including the lamb, mushroom, Korean short rib, and täk? (octopus). The gamut were well executed with various textures in each that were just perfect. But let's be clear, one stands above them all EASILY. It's the Täk? ... it's up there with one of the most flavorful bites I can remember. The mushroom was a perfect change up as was the Korean. The lamb came up 4th in our ranking, but still so very good, just not quite as tender as the others. Do yourself a favor and belly up to their well-tended bar soon. This out-of-towner will indeed be quite jealous. PS. Did I neglect to mention the tortillas are made on site and flattop heated til soft and golden? How dare I."}
{"text":"Tako never disappoints. Although it's always very very crowded. You need to factor that into any visit here. This is only the second time we ever had a reservation. Usually hover around the bar hoping to get a spot there.    The cocktails are interesting and reasonably priced. Just beware of the tequila shots, you can rack up some big bucks there... I know from experience. Guacamole with tuna, always a hit. Steak and Al Pastor tacos are also winners.  Always have had good service at the especially at the bar."}
{"text":"It's hard to find the perfect taco place in Pittsburgh, because tacos should be light and tasty...that's what you will going to find when you try Tako..you can chose one of the  deferent tacos, beef, chicken, fish ..( Korean taco the best was my favorite beside the chicken  ) octopus and more..also the place decorated in a unique way..I love the atmosphere ..sure I will try it again & again  Good luck Tako"}
{"text":"I loved all of it.  The server was a bit over the top, but he was just passionate about the food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had!  Didn't realize you need to make reservations weeks in advance, but we found two seats at the small bar on a busy Sunday evening.  Chips and guacamole were amazing!  Great cocktails!  The tacos were expensive but delicious.  My husband got the tako taco (grilled octopus) and I got the grilled fish special taco.  I wish I had gotten the octopus!  It was amazing!    We are moving to Pittsburgh soon and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My two friends and I made our reservation about a month in advance for 8pm on a Thursday night. We got in, and it was, as expected, really crowded. Once we were seated on the much quieter second floor overlooking downstairs, we dived straight into the menus.   A mix of good and bad, but mostly good. The apple cranberry margarita I ordered was strong, but I could not taste the apple cranberry at all. It tasted more like raspberry to me? We created our own guac to share and added smoked salmon, corn, and onion. We thought the salmon would be raw, but it wasn't. Still good, but a little disappointing. But their chips are tasty!  My chorizo tacos (chorizo, egg, cheese, cilantro) were great other than the mysterious sweet flavor that bothered me a little, partly because I didn't know where it was coming from. The tacos are not large, but I'd say two of them plus sharing an appetizer and dessert are perfectly enough for dinner. The churro/funnel cake we got for dessert was not good. I wanted it to be hotter and crispier, and I didn't think the fruitiness worked well with the rest of it.   Interesting decor, good service, and good tacos.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"My mushroom tacos were delicious through and through, from the tender, delicate taco shell to the creamy sauce."}
{"text":"If you can get past the noise and paying $7-12 per taco, you will find some awesome food at Tako. We finally managed reservations and found the food to be quite good.  The house taco, i.e, Tako, was made with Spanish octopus, microgreens, and a pesto-like dressing was outstanding, even at $12 each. All eight in our group loved their meal and the specialty salsa were all flavorful with a nice level of heat.  This place is not for picky eaters or those with a huge appetite, but I would definitely return eager to try some of the other speciality items."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere! The food was absolutely delicious! Our waiter seemed to be very knowledgeable about what they had to offer!  The menu was a little pricey, but WELL worth the money! I will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Okay so I have been here more than a few times. The food is quite tasty. The cost is a bit over price for tacos however the food I enjoy. The downside is that a reservation must be made in order to secure a table. I arrived on two different occasions without a reservation and was told that I didn't need a reservation when I call to place a reservation. This quite naturally irritated me because I wanted to sit outside and was told there was a wait I was told that I can sit at a table but I can only sit there for an hour. I came with my pregnant best friend and I certainly didn't want her to feel rushed while we were eating. I enjoy the environment but just not so much of the extraness. It kind of irked me that it's a small restaurant with a big city feel however is not accommodating. Just my personal opinion."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to do when I come to Pittsburgh is try new restaurants. This place has gotten rave reviews from my colleagues so I decided to give it a try. As soon as I sat down at the bar, the bartenders were very attentive. I got a red sangria that was absolutely delicious. I asked the bartender if I should do ceviche or poke and he suggested poke so I did, and I was not disappointed. The chunks of fish were huge and the sweet ginger sauce was delicious. I got a flourless chocolate cake to go that I promised I would only eat half of and promptly ate the entire thing. If this spot was in my city, I know where I would be taking future dates. Great ambience!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food, the drinks and the scene.  Chorizo tacos = to die for! Includes fried egg on top which was perfectly cooked Shrimp tacos = perfectly seasoned Guacamole = add cotija and pineapple! Street corn = party in your mouth Frosé with a prosecco float = yummy!  Make reservations in advance (about a week) and prepare to have your mind blown :)"}
{"text":"We are so glad we stopped here. First suggestion....make a reservation if it's the weekend.  Everything we had was incredible!  Classic guacamole, Ceviche, chicken tacos, street corn and yellow margaritas. Yum! Yum!  Now in our list of top 10 restaurants. We will definitely be back....soon!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Tako could be a five star rating with a bit more focus on execution of flavors.  The interiors are... stimulating.  I'll just leave it at that, because that's not always a good thing.  I do appreciate the use of the octopus graphics and it translating through to the light fixtures and door pull, but the lighting approach and some other features simply aren't successful.  I'm not here for a design jury, so I'll get to it.  The guacamole... so much potential with a variety of options for the build-your-own approach, ranging from traditional mexican ingredients to the inevitable asian inspiration drawn from the restaurant name.  This can go either way if people don't understand complimentary flavors, but on the bright side there are preset combos to ease their way in.  The cost is a bit high for the standard bowl before add-ins, particularly when considered next to the end product and what is most important... seasoning.  I thought I was going on the high side of flavor with the addition of chorizo, pickled habanero, queso fresco, and pepitas... the one item I wish I could have added as a write-in candidate was salt.  I understand most times the amount of salt on the accompanying chips is sufficient to compliment guacamole, but avocados can be a fickle mistress and lay flat on your tongue... unfortunately this was one of those times.  Also disappointing was that all of the aforementioned ingredients were mixed in prior to serving, destroying most of the desired texture contrast and layering of flavor.  This could have been much better, but was nothing to write home about or justify the price point.  The tacos, however, were significantly better on the whole.  Name a place (albeit indirectly) after your signature item and it better deliver.  The bistec was cooked and seasoned perfectly, having a great contrast between crisp char from the grill and a tender medium rare center.  Shishitos were enhanced with a quick blister by pan frying and provided a great compliment to the beef, with a bit of freshness added by way of the salsa roja and cilantro.  Like many great tacos, a dusting of queso fresco finished a relatively great bite.  The octopus, which can be very successful or a complete disaster from a texture standpoint depending on preparation, was borderline perfect.  A crispy charred exterior contrasted the tender and succulent cephalopod tentacle interior with the right amount of salt, laid over a slightly bitter bed of greens and a mellow harissa aioli.  The preserved lemon was more flavor forward than desired and provided more sweetness than expected... unfortunately this was not counterbalanced by the pickled onion.  If the sweetness were to be replaced by some serrano heat on this taco, it would be exceptional... but it was still a flavorful and well balanced combination.  Tecate was $4, as it should be.  No review necessary as they are almost required with tacos, regardless of their refinement level.  I will be back and bring others that haven't had the experience, I'll just make sure a reservation is made well in advance since it's always packed.  DeShantz is getting pretty good at this restaurant empire thing."}
{"text":"This place might be the most overrated in the city. The prices are pretty much ridiculous and it's pitch black inside. Nearly impossible to get a reservation bc it's the cool place to go.. the food and drinks are good (especially the octopus taco) but I can't fathom the prices. I'm just not a fan of the pretentious restaurants in the city especially because there's so many good places that don't have this vibe. Go to Bakersfield instead."}
{"text":"I wish that I had something different to say from all of the other reviews, but when it's good it's just plain good. I've sampled many different combinations of the made to order guacamole, and had a variety of tacos (carne asada, chicken, mahi, and Korean just to name a few) as well as the cheesecake, which I had no intention of trying until the waitress recommended it.  Every. Single. Thing. Is. Amazing. Every. Single. Time. If I have any complaints it would be that I have to make a reservation for a weekend dinner about two months in advance. But again it's worth it.  I'm not a huge drinker, but I sampled my friends margarita and it was refreshing and crisp... Not a one that comes from a mix or a blender.  I would also advise that the ambiance, while very trendy and fun is incredibly loud. If you're looking for a place to have good conversation I would probably not choose Tako. Instead I would go to Tako, eat, and then go somewhere else to talk!! Whatever you do...put this spot on your bucket list...you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal drink selections. Sangria was one the best I've had! Poblano appetizer was suggested. It was alright but would try something else. Highly recommend the guacamole with jalapeños. Al pastor, chorizo and pork belly were great choices."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite forever. I'm currently living in San Diego, Taco capital of the world, and these are still my -#1. All the tacos are great, but I love the Korean. They have an intense flavor and are on the salty side which I love, but be cautious if you're not a salt person. This Baja is a close second place for me. The mango crab gauc is my favorite thing on the menu. It's so delicious and never fishy at all, but a little spicy sometimes. Also all of the margs are great and definitely worth trying! The atmosphere is unique and the decor is funky,  love it here! Get a reservation on their website, they get pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Tako - what can I say.  I love you.  I visited the first week you were open and I visited during restaurant week and at least once between those 2 visits and again a few weeks ago.    First off - the staff and service at Tako is the best.  We have always had reservations (i don't recommend going without them), and have always been promptly seated.    Second off - the food.  I've done a variety of things for appetizers - specialty quac, queso, salsa - all of which is amazing.  They are always willing to bring extra chips too!  My fav - thus far - is the Korean tacos.  I have tried a few of the others, but once I tried the Korean tacos - I was sold.  No need to try others!  They are the best.    Just a note to future patrons - you get 2 tacos per order.  I would suggest you and your friend get 2 different kinds, then you can share!  It's the best way to try multiple tacos!"}
{"text":"My first trip to tako, I came by myself on my pre-move homefinding trip at the recommendation of my coworker. As I sat in the small outside bar area, watching the kitchen staff do their thing, I was hoping beyond hope that I would like this place. It was so cute and I love the open kitchen concept.  Thankfully, this was by far the best food I had during that trip, and I thought to myself, \"This'll do. This'll do just fine.\"  The tacos were spectacular. Inventive but more importantly full of flavor, and not incredibly expensive for gourmet tacos.  I came back recently and tried some more tacos (I now find that the Korean tacos and the Al Pastor are my favorite so far), BUT a highlight of my night was the tuna belly guacamole (#2 of the chef specials). So so delicious. A little bit of salty, a little bit of almost sweet, and a lot a bit of umami (I'm not quite sure what umami is but I know it when I taste it!).  Also, try the spicy passionfruit margarita. Sweet but not too sweet, spicy but not too spicy, boozy but not too boozy.  Long story short, tako is amazing, and I plan to be back many times. So glad that there are solid food options in Pittsburgh. Makes me excited to be here :)  (Also, hello Pittsburgh!  I'm new!  Find me good places please :D)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I looked at the menu, but some friends really wanted to try it before a show. The food was delicious and prices weren't terrible. The only drawback was that seating was a bit cramped. The booths were bigger than most but still not really comfortable for 6 adults."}
{"text":"My mom and I made reservations for Tako before seeing a show across the street. The location is perfect! It's right near all the theaters and there are several landing garages nearby.   We made reservations through the Yelp app about a week prior and there were only 2 options left, 5 or 8. We chose 5pm and seemed to open the place for dinner. It was a great time to be there because it was not overly crowded. The tables and bar did fill up but we never felt like we had people on top of us!   The food was just awesome! We had the chopped salad and papas bravas (potatoes) for starters. It was the perfect portions for two of us to split, and we ended up even bringing some potatoes home. The salas was incredible! There were roasted chickpeas, walnuts, bacon, feta on romaine lettuce. The flavors were amazing! The potatoes were so crispy and yet soft in the middle, not greasy at all, just so much flavor! Definitely get it!!  I had a meal from the specials of the day, the BBQ quesadilla. It was such a huge portion! The pork just melted in my mouth! And the tortilla was so good, not just your average tortilla. It all tasted so authentic! My mom had the pollo taco. She loved it! It was slightly spicy but the sauce balanced it all out.   The decor was so cool! Very dark, which made it hard for my mom to see the menu, but after ordering it it was not a problem! My mom said it felt like we were inside the Moulin Rouge, ha!   I definitely want to go back and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Either make a reservation weeks or months in advance, plan on waiting, or go late, late night. Luckily, we made a reservation for an early dinner - so there was no wait and no crowd.  Although service was a bit slow for so early in the evening, the food was out of this world. For an appetizer, we had street corn (grilled corn, siracha mayo, cojito cheese, scallions, lime), which was as good or better than any street corn I ever had in Arizona. For dinner, my hubby had salmon tacos (blood orange, goat cheese, pistachio vinaigrette) - and said they were the best fish tacos ever. I had pork belly tacos (cucumber, asian BBQ sauce, grilled bok choy) - and wish I could have had room to eat more! The flavors of the tacos were perfect.  The ambiance of tako is also part of the experience. The interior is impeccably designed; and, the DJ was spinning some classic '90s hip hop.   Overall, I highly recommend the food at tako!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. For our starter, we ordered the special ceviche, which was shrimp.  It was perfect.  We then had the Korean and Tako tacos.  Both were so good.  The octopus on the Tako taco was perfectly done.  The tapioca dessert was to die for.  Great drinks too.  I am from Philly, but if I ever get back to Pittsburgh, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had to make are reservations a head of time, but it was worth the wait!   I couldn't understand why you had to make a reservation so far ahead of time until I ate there!    The food is Amazing !   The tacos are amazing,  I had the chicken tacos they were so good , I wish I would have ordered a few more!   They had so much flavor,   I can't remember everything that was on the taco but the flavors went together so well!   Best tacos I every had!   The interior is really cool also!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here again now with reservations on a Wednesday night at 9 pm. It definitely was better sitting inside, because the decor has some cool vibes. My friend and I started off with the street corn and the #5 guacamole. The guac came pretty quickly and had crab, mango, and habanero peppers in it. The crab was jumbo lump and fresh and the mango was a nice addition. The corn was also spicy and flavorful just not a huge fan of cojita cheese.   For dinner, we had the Korean taco and the chorizo taco. The Korean taco was delicious and had a nice sweet and spicy flavor. The chorizo taco was good as well but could have used more of a crunch. I would recommend coming later on a weeknight, because it really was not that busy and we were in an out in about an hour."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks and apps. Had a couple of margaritas, chips and salsa, queso, and guacamole. Everything was great and the guacamole was fantastic . The ambiance in the restaurant was great as well. Need to come back for tacos but can only imagine how delicious they are!"}
{"text":"Tako serves tacos. Tacos. TACOS! That should be enough for you to give it a shot, but I shall elaborate..  I've heard that you typically need a reservation for Tako, but we opted to walk in on Labor Day at opening and got seated right away! But I definitely hear that this is the exception to the rule.   Place is definitely a funky little rap-tastic spot with an underwater industrial/modern goth vibe. My only complaint regarding the ambiance is the lighting. It's a shade above pitch black like so many of these nouveau riche, hipster joints popping up. I like to see my meal. When I can't, I start to panic about possible unseen hairs or aged avocados. Part I of the illusive fifth star.  We ordered two appetizers - chips and salsa and the papas bravas. The chips and salsa came out quickly and included three varieties, salsa de arbol (so good and sooo dangerous) roasted tomatillo (cilantro lover here!), and poblano. They were all jam packed with flavor! Then the papas bravas arrived and almost ruined my dinner.....I COULDN'T stop eating them. They were the perfect balance of crispy and creamy and crunchy and amazing. The aioli is the stuff of fantasies.   As for tacos, we ordered the al pastor, the baja fish, and the bistec. The pork shoulder and pineapple was unparalleled. Acidic and sweet with spice and texture - Oh my! The steak on my husbands bistec was some of the most tender I have ever had the pleasure of tasting!  But here comes part II behind the missing fifth star ....The baja was barely 'meh'. Way too sweet. And not in the sticky savory way like a glaze just downright sugary. It screamed for some acid or a squeeze of lemon. The menu also stated 'tempura white fish'. I've had some tempura in my day and this sure didn't seem like tempura. It had more of a bread crumb texture than anything. The fish was also heavy and a touch too greasy. It broke my heart because I truly love me some fish tacos :(  Dessert special was a tapioca with sorbet and fresh fruit and it was D-VINE! I was unable to get it out of my mind the entire following day.   All in all, it's great. All mistakes need not even seek forgiveness. Super original takes on super tasty dishes. I will go back and eat until I wanna barf, no doubt."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty cool. Inside is more of a darker environment compared to the regularly lit restaurants. I am giving a 3 star rating because the guacamole was just 'ok' for my liking. I was not wow'd by the guac. I am rating to pretty picky standards because I consider the guacamole quality to define this type of restaurant.   I also had the Al Pastor tacos, which were good.  I definitely recommend trying this place out. Maybe you will consider the guac 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night around 9:30 and they originally told us our wait would be 45 mins but we got a table for 2 within 15 mins.   The place is dimly lit and loud so not a place to go if you're looking to really have a conversation.   The food: it was just my boyfriend and I and we couldn't decide which tacos to get so we ended up getting 3 different tacos without any appetizers to split and try a variety. We got the steak, duck, and Korean tacos. The Korean ones were had a bit overpowering of a sauce but the steak and duck were delicious. They definitely didn't skimp on serving the protein, a problem I've run into before. The price for 2 tacos an order is just slightly pricey, but again, not too bad for how much they put in the tacos."}
{"text":"I am visiting for Thanksgiving so this was my first time here. They had really good music last night and the drinks were good too. This place has a really great atmosphere and is attached to Butcher & Rye so you can bounce back and forth between both spots. Next time I'll try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in the city. Trendy, upscale taqueria (fancy tacos). Very good value and good house special drinks as well. Late night scene is great too, I prefer a 10 PM reservation."}
{"text":"I've been told it can get pretty difficult to get a table here so I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to snag two outside counter seats within 5 minutes on a Wednesday night! It was a gorgeous day and they have heat lamps above the counter!  Our server was incredibly witty and personable and not in an annoying way. In an awesome way.  The experience of sitting outside while also watching the chefs do their thing is definitely 5 stars. The turquoise glassware our water was served in was so unique. And the MUSIC ahhhhh amazing. It was faint, but I definitely heard some of The Weeknd and Wiz.   My favorite cocktails always seem to center around cucumber... so I was really excited to try the Spicy Cucumber margarita ($10). It did not disappoint. The exact right combination of Espolon tequila, cucumber, lime, and Serrano....  I can almost still taste it.... seriously, so good.   We started with the build your own guac... what! Awesome. There are lots of add ons to select from (we opted for pineapple, goat cheese, and smoked salmon) and the portion was generous.   We split the Baja tacos ($12) and the special beef barbacoa tacos ($13) (spicy cabbage, sesame seed salsa, avocado). The tacos themselves only get a 3.5 or 4. They were good, not great... and for the price I was hoping for great.  I also prefer grilled fish tacos instead of fried... but the beef was flavorful and tender.   But the tortillas definitely get a 5. I'm part Mexican and these are the first tortillas outside of my family that I have loved.   I can't speak to what it's like inside... but the outside experience was a blast. And I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. My husband likes the different tacos, I don't. They are all mediocre. Service usually sucks for mediocre food. Called for reservations for his birthday, when I wanted to add two more people to the party, I was told that I couldn't because seats fill up too fast. When I explained that it was his birthday, the lady could care less. Her response was \"well at 945 at night we can seat that many people.\" My reservation is for 515. Completely ruined his birthday. And it's completely ridiculous. After this- will never return. My money and time is clearly more appreciated elsewhere."}
{"text":"My review is only for the \"late night tacos\". We arrived at 11:40pm on a Saturday, we were told the kitchen was closed until midnight when they would serve \"late night tacos\", website says they are open serving food until midnight, but I love tacos, so no matter. However, at midnight (we couldn't order food in between times?) we order \"late night tacos\".....they were awful. Slightly better than taco bell, but only slightly. I realize this is more for the bar crowd and shouldn't have expected much, but I did expect to arrive at 11:40 and order some guac....nope! The place was dark and loud, which I usually love, but the music was a little over the top and the couple at the bar mimicing having sex turned out to be an employee - don't think any tacos could bring me back"}
{"text":"In love with the Korean BQQ tacos!!! Most of the tacos are vey delicious and pretty filling. The quest was a little heavy. Generally fast service, beat the rush by coming early or after a Pittsburgh Cultural Trust show downtown. The avocado gin drink is to die for!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner.   The decor was great. Loved the art and the chain chandeliers.   The menu looked promising but all the food was under seasoned.   The drinks were great.   The music was too loud to have a good dinner conversation."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Tako. I really enjoy my first experience. This one not so much. The service was poor. The table next to us sat down, ordered and had drinks before our server greeted us. I didn't like the drinks. Our queso came out cold and coagulated. The tako taco was delicious. The bistec was nothing special. Pretty disappointed especially considering it was nearly $100 meal for two. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service as last time, but a big NO THANK YOU to their uncompromising policy on changing your reservation. I called the restaurant at noon today to request our party of 2 at 730 be changed to 3 and was told that would require a larger table and seating couldn't be accommodated until 11pm. No exceptions. Instead of telling our friend he couldn't come, we showed up with 3 thinking it wouldn't be a big deal, but were told at the door that we can only sit outside when another party leaves. We ended up accepting, but thank god it wasn't a humid night. We were finally seated but the reservation restrictions leave a world to be desired.... especially when you need to book at least a month in advance for a Friday night. God forbid you have a last minute change of plans. Sorry to be a bitch, because this was inconvenient. The place isn't exclusive. When you boil it down, it's just another restaurant of many downtown and you can go elsewhere. The food is excellent, but it isn't THAT amazing. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I was here in the summer of 2017- the town was overrun with furries. Google it.  I don't think I've ever had better tacos. The menu is full of interesting choices but you can build your own, if you like. I let the experts chose for me--good choice."}
{"text":"Not awful, but not very good and also outrageously expensive. The space is OK and the service was good.   Grew up in the southwestern part of the US and this does not compare to taco places or fusion taco places I have frequented."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh was just voted #1 foodie scene in the US and in the article I read, Takö was named specifically. This place is TINY but really good food and drinks. The bartenders are truly mixologists and make an awesome drink. The kitchen is visible and when it's nice outside there is some walk up bar seating. The only reason I think it's not 5 stars is it slightly overpriced in my opinion. It's something I'd do every once in a while, but reservations are a MUST and come with some dough."}
{"text":"I was anxiously awaiting the opening of Tako and went with some friends last week.   The decor has a similar vibe to sister restaurant, Butcher in the Rye. It's very hip, eclectic and sexy. The music is a little loud upstairs but not a huge big deal. They have bar seats outside facing the open kitchen, along with some outdoor tables, which is a great set up on a beautiful day.   We ordered a little bit of everything from the menu and every single thing we ordered was excellent !!!!! The queso fundido, patayas, guacamole, salsa and the chicken, brisket and mushroom tacos.   I think this may be my new favorite place !!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to take out of town guests when they visit.  It's such a fun and unique experience, and the food is phenomenal.  We went for lunch one day without reservations and were able to sit on the sidewalk.  They were exceptionally busy, but the service was still stellar.  I got their cocktail of the day and it was fantastic.  All of the taco's were outstanding.  Anybody looking for a fun food experience in Pittsburgh should definitely check Tako out."}
{"text":"Great food! Delicious drinks s! Cool menu! Fun place within walking distance to sports & entertainment venues."}
{"text":"Great selection of tequila, fun cocktails, and most importantly amazing takos! My boyfriend and I checked this place out on President's day. The place was packed, but we were able to mozy up to the bar and grab a drink while waiting to snag a seat, which didn't take long. We started off with the guac and the kale salad, and finished with the duck confit and pork tacos. All around great food. Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. We made our own guacamole to start and then ordered the Baja tacos and the special grilled shrimp tacos. I ordered an El Diablo margarita which was also delicious. Our server was friendly. It was so loud in there with the DJ that my boyfriend and I were shouting to each other across the table to carry a conversation, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This review is for take out. I walked in on a sunny day shortly after tako had opened and was able to place an order seamlessly. I thought I would be the first one of the day but there were already a few people ahead of me who had the same idea!   After placing my order, I waited in the entryway for a few minutes. It was nice to have the kitchen at work in front of me - I felt like I was at the aquarium or zoo watching behind a glass. Ha!   I transported my bag of goods home and everything was packaged nicely and unharmed. I had ordered the tako and the chips and salsa (the taco was in a cardboard box, the chips in a paper bag and the salsa in circular plastic containers - all of which are in a paper bag so thumbs up to the packaging materials). I love octopus but have never had it in the form of a taco and given the name of the place I figure I might as well try though it was a tough decision.   The tako was deliciously different - the octopus was probably the meatiest I've ever had in any type of food which was a delightful surprise, the fried beans gave a nice crunch and the person who built the taco you could tell was an expert - they weren't overfilled or too sparse with ingredients, and everything held together perfectly with the right amount of sauce. As for the chips and salsa I thought they were just ok. Just like eating in I received a trio of their salsas and each container was labeled which was a nice touch. The verde salsa was by far my favorite; the other two red salsas were watery so didn't taste like anything but bland mush, particularly the one that is suppose to be spicy which was unfortunate.  However the staff was so friendly and given the overall positive experience, taking out provides a great alternative to when getting a reservation at tako is not possible (and I've tried to make reservations on multiple occasions)! I think one of the major downsides though is finding and paying for parking in Downtown near tako. Also as others have expressed it is not a cheap meal, mine was ~$27."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. A must-try! From the moment you enter the restaurant, there are cool vibes. The build-your-own guac menu is very unique. The 'Tako's' are served on wooden chop boards, and are absolutely delicious. Beware, seating is at a minimum, though, and the joint fills up very fast every night. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was overpriced for the quality of food. Aesthetically speaking, it was great, but would not go back for the food alone."}
{"text":"It was too hard to get a reservation. I booked about 2 weeks in advance and only got a reservation at 9:30 pm on a Wednesday night. Besides that, the food was delicious and the service was very good. We got a table upstairs so you can see the view of the whole restaurant and it wasn't too noisy.   Among the five different tacos we ordered, the octopus taco was the best in my opinion. The other ones were all a little bit on the salty side. Duck confit taco has a surprisingly taste. If you know Peking duck - it's very similar to that!   I'd love to go there again (if I can get a reservation at a normal dinner time)."}
{"text":"Again, the place was phenomenal!!! Pittsburgh has has to be one of the coolest cities in the US.  The food at Tako is insane.  Start with the octopus and then move to the Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin! Everything about this place was amazing. From the decor to the wait staff to the drinks and food. I can't wait to go back. I haven't heard one bad thing about this place. Pricing was decent but affordable. The mezcal old fashioned was different and delicious.   Food recommendations - papas bravas and build your own guac. I had the pollo + pork belly taco, but I've been told their best known for the octopus taco. Most people say not to waste your time making a reservation. Walk-ins are usually fairly accommodated. If you have larger than 4 people in your party plan ahead. If not, just go!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find time to make it down here for about a year. But my schedule and their availability just didn't match up....until a few weeks ago. This place was everything I heard it was and more. My wife and I started with their chicken wings...awesome. They are fried three times which creates a super crunchy exterior but keeps the chicken super moist and tender. They are tossed in an Asian fusion sauce which was extremely flavorful. I would be re-missed if I didn't mention the pickled veggies that came with the wings....a nice touch, very flavorful. We also got the make your own Guac, which was very good as well. For our main course my wife got the Carnitas which she said we great and filled with flavor. I chose to go with the Tako Taco. The Octopus was some of the most tender pieces of Octopus I have had with a great compliment of toppings and sauce. For dessert we got the TresLeche cake.....unreal. I'll start by saying TresLeche is our favorite kind of cake and this was on another level. Not only did it have the classic moistness from the milk topping, but they mixed the milk with caramel and cinnamon which just added an amazing depth of flavor.  All in all, loved every course and would definitely recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"This place exudes cool.  Glass encloses the kitchen.  The dining area is dim, with octopus on the walls and red light fixtures dangling from the ceiling.  Our uber-hipster waitress explained that tako was Japanese for octopus.    Three of us ordered different tacos.  The winner was the chorizo taco, with the fried egg on top.  I didn't care for the Korean taco; it was way too sweet. On the other hand the choco taco, a desert, wasn't sweet enough.  There's something off with that.  The tacos are expensive by Texas standards. Similar tacos at Austin's Torchy's Tacos, or Velvet Taco in Dallas, run about half as much.  Even the tableside guacamole at Boudro's on San Antonio's Riverwalk is 50% cheaper than it is here.  But there don't seem to be any other fusion taco places around, so I imagine it's OK for Pittsburgh.  I'd try it again at least once."}
{"text":"This is more of a 2-1/2 rating because my chicken taco was good but it wasn't worth the price.  This is more of 2-1/2 because it was late on a Saturday night when we got here and I would think it would be different during the daytime hours.   We have wanted to try out this restaurant for a while now.  The problem we have had is you need a reservation usually on the weekends for Tako and we usually want to come here last minute so you really need to plan ahead.   This time was no different because we got here after 11pm coming back from a Pirates game on a Saturday night.       Just walking up to Tako you can see that it was packed and jamming with music!  We walked up and the hostess said that we can try to go to the bar or have a seat.  He said he had a table for us so we got a seat because the bar was full.       It was loud in there sounded like a club.  I'm thinking that it was only like this because it was late Saturday night but it was jumping!       We got the menu and looked at the drinks first.  We got two beers but we weren't' that impressed with their drink or food menu.   We were hungry so tacos sounded good for the night.  I ordered the Pollo Asado and my wife got the Duck Confit.         When our food got here were dove right into our tacos but we noticed that it was small.  We got 2 tacos for $14 and nothing else.  I know we are downtown and things are expensive but we have gotten tacos at other restaurants in the city and received a lot more food for about the same price.  I did like my chicken tacos though but my wife did not like her Duck.  She ate my other taco and I ate her duck.  She was right it wasn't too flavorful and greasy.  My taco was very good but it should have came with 3 tacos or some sides to make me satisfied.         They seem always busy so good for them but if you want a good taco place there are other ones that are better than Tako."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the entire city!! Worth the 2 month reservation wait! Best margs, best tacos, best street corn!!"}
{"text":"Korean tacos are the best! Love the grapefruit and sage cocktail. Make your own guacamole is always great. Lots of interesting daily specialty tacos. Love that they are open for lunch now."}
{"text":"My son and I had tickets to see Idina Menzel in concert. We tried to make reservations but found out to get a descent time you have to schedule two weeks out. I stopped over there when it opened with intent of trying to secure a future reservation and was told they would take us at 6:45. Outside there were tables and bar stools each with a sign advising you to check with the restaurant for those tables.  When I met up with my son later on i got a text reminder from the place advising me to confirm or decline my reservation by replying with the appropriate number. The two of us arrived and were seated inside. The place had a vibrant bar scene, was extremely dark, and very noisy.It was also extremely crowded and very hard to read the menu. Directly in front of me was the \"WC\" which I later found out was a unisex bathroom with dark patterned decor.  We were given tap water to drink along with a pitcher (no ice).Our waiter explained to us that Tako is Japanese for \"octopus\" hence that menu item is named as such. My son wanted to try the duck confit tacos and I settled for the mushroom tacos. The waiter gave us a special menu that we had to read next to some religious candle outlining the specials of the day. He was hungry so we ordered the customized  guacamole with mango and tuna belly. It is served with chips. We received that first and it was outstanding! Some of it was extremely spicy but it made a great appetizer.  Our tacos were served on wooden boards. We each got two. My son liked the duck but thought it was a bit sweet. I liked the mushroom tacos but found them a little bland. So I took some of that guacamole and threw it on top of my tacos  to add that needed zest.  Although we were told they had WiFi we were not able to connect to it. We had enough with the chips and tacos so we passed on dessert. My son thought the food was Asian inspired. We received a postcard attached to the check which I thought would serve as a reminder of this place.  My true rating would have been 3 1/2 stars but I normally round up when I can't decide. One word of advice-They are not open Sun and Mon but you can leave a message if you want to make a reservation. They did call me Mon and advised that normally for weekdays reserve two weeks in advance and for weekends a month in advance. I'm not sure if I would have been seated if I had decided to eat when it opens but I think with the popularity of this place it would be wise to make a reservation."}
{"text":"The service was inexcusable. As a foodie and promoter of both Meat & Potatoes and Butcher & the Rye, I was incredible excited to try this new hot spot during my recent visit back to the Burgh. I was delighted when we called and learned that there was no wait.  Long story short, we ended up leaving after a steep bar bill and the incompetent hostess inability to seat a simple table of three."}
{"text":"I'm from the taco capital of the world San Diego & this place rocks.  Incredible quality, awesome taste and very filling.  Order the 12 pack taco board if you have 3-4 people.  You get to try different types at a lower price.  Also, great service and experience.  Expect a long wait on prime nights.  Jason was also a great server."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. First time got the Korean taco and cucumber margarita. The Korean taco was very flavorful but the beef was too sweet and fried for my taste. The cucumber margarita was unfortunately not as spicy as I had expected. The second time I tried the octopus (tako) taco and lychee and pepper margarita and it changed my life... Mind blown! The margarita was amazing, not too spicy with this awesome smokey taste. The tako taco was perfection in taste. Will definitely be back for this amazing combination."}
{"text":"Great place! I travel the country for work and I try to hit local, eclectic hot food scene places. This is up there in my top 5. Who would think great taco place in Pittsburgh? But if in town you have to try it. Fresh, well seasoned and portions were huge. How many times will you get an octopus taco that was more tender than the lamb belly! Soft shell crab was amazing. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"YUM! I loved it here, but I LOVE this type of food. These are not your average tacos and you will leave thinking of what you want to try next time. This time we just got the trio of chips and salsa, the korrean and baja tacos. The options are creative, yet simple leaving your taste buds happy. Everything was rich in flavor and filling. I had just had guacamole earlier in the day so wasn't feeling it at the time, but build your own guac! By the others sitting near us, it looked pretty amazing. I would suggest making a reservation, because we went on a Tuesday and couldn't get in until 8:45 pm.  Why not give it 5 stars? Well, it's loud... like VERY loud. So at least you can stuff your face, because a conversation is not easy to have here. I can deal with people loudness, but the music was like a club, which isn't ideal for a meal if you ask me. If they would fix that, this place would be perfect. The word is out, and it's to go to täk?... and I agree!"}
{"text":"Okay, I definitely give this place 5 stars for food quality. A little pricey, but delicious. HOWEVER, while i totally love outside seating and watching the kitchen, I will admit that I saw less than appetizing practices. If you are going to let your customers watch you prepare food, please please please make sure your hygiene is on point. I observed chefs eating without washing their hands and going back to touching food. An employee run his fingers through his hair and then delicately place garnish on some taco. A patron sneeze directly toward their ingredients stored in open containers. If a salad bar has a sneeze guard, outside seating should also. And I get it, you're working and wanna listen to music. But if I'm paying $50 for a single meal, please don't make me listen to 50 cent and Eminem songs saying nigga and faggot? Come on guys. If your patrons can here this, you might want to up the classiness. I sat outside for the ambience and experience though. Definitely got that :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 9 stars I would.   Where to begin. Cocktails. Extremely fun interpretations of classics. The \"Ramos\" gin fizz was such a unique version of the original I'll spend months trying to recreate it.   The poke was the best I have had since I lived in Hawaii.   Duck confit tacos. Even better than they sound.   Eat here. Eat here now.   Update: Queso fundido is silly good. We've now worked through about half the menu and have yet to find anything less than spectacular."}
{"text":"Definitely overhyped and overpriced, but the food wasn't that bad.  They have excellent toppings and sauces for their tacos, but the meat itself wasn't that great. They're elote (corn) is not traditional, but very very good! If you're looking for some good traditional tacos, don't come here. If you're looking for some fusion and somewhat creative tacos, come here!   This place is way overpriced. Then again, maybe it's because Pittsburgh doesn't have many taco places.   Coming from LA, I'm not very familiar with the taco scene in Pittsburgh. But I've had better tacos for 1/5th of the price in LA, NY, and of course Mexico."}
{"text":"Great tacos. My party order three different ones and we mixed them up. Bristec was my favorite followed by the Korean and Al Pastor. Regular gloc was awesome and so were the chips. May be the best I have ever had. Yelp reservation worked perfect."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this joint has 4.5 stars out of 200+ reviews. Simply incredible. Short rib and chorizo tacos are money! Love this place."}
{"text":"I have a serious love for tacos, so it's a total shame that it took me so long to check out Tako. I finally made it here with a couple of friends during restaurant week. We had a great experience and I'm really looking forward to my next visit!  We started with guacamole and queso. For the guacamole, we chose from the list of offerings (but you can also build your own) and selected the variety with crab meat. It was delicious and so fresh! The queso was a special offering for restaurant week (Tako was offering a daily list of special items in place of the usual prix fixe menu). It was also tasty, though we preferred to dip the tortilla chips (that came with the guacamole) than use the flour tortillas that it was served with.   I selected the carnitas tacos for my entree. The tacos come two per order, but they are HUGE so don't worry about leaving hungry. A generous pile of flavorful braised pork was topped with guac, salsa verde, chicharrones, and topped with cilantro. It was a great combination of flavors.  I washed all of this down with a spicy cucumber margarita, which was cool and refreshing but had a subtle kick. Overall, this was an excellent meal in a really cool space."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it never disappoints. The tacos are big and really stuffed full of goodies, so while the menu price may look high for a couple of tacos, it is not considering the size of the dish. We've had many types of the tacos here and love them all. Do not pass on the Mexican Corn. Just get it. Seriously. Get it. And the margaritas are delicious too!"}
{"text":"I know three stars is looked at as bad on here- but really this place is exactly three stars (which isn't a bad thing).  First its almost impossible to get in and then people are jam packed right next to each other, plus its LOUD, so not the best dining experience.  The drinks and food are really good- however, there are a lot of more exotic, imaginative (\"inspired\") choices, however, if you just want standard fare, you'll have trouble finding anything.  Plus this place is just a bit on the high price side for what you get (again- the food is absolutely quality - but you have to run up a big check to not go home hungry.)"}
{"text":"Pretty good.   It's a little on the pricy side and a lot on the crowded side.  Very little seating and no lunch hours is a nice way to create some artificial demand and they've tapped into it.   I just wanted to try some tacos.   The tacos are great.  The chorizo and queso is average.  The fact that it's so busy and they artificially cause that to increase demand and make the place seem more hip than it actually is?   That's annoying.  The food is 4 star worthy,  being over priced knocks that down to 3 stars, artificially crowded and average service knocks it to 1 and a place I don't want to go through the trouble of going to again.  These things matter,  a lot."}
{"text":"Superb. Right on. Way to go. Fantastic. Far out. Groovy.   In other words, there are no words to describe how good these tacos are!! I had the Korean wagyu beef tacos the other night (and we came around 9pm and were seated immediately) and it has the most amazing pickled slaw on top. The drinks look great too, but unfortunately I've been living like a poor college student these days and had to choose one or the other. I think $14 for 2 tacos is a bit much, but, whatta ya gonna do. It's downtown and they can charge these kind of prices. The beef was SO tender and I wish I could have eaten another. They were gobbled in about 5 minutes flat. Will be back, fo sho."}
{"text":"Interesting menu, well balanced selection options. Staff and style are weird, it the best sense of the word. There was a camera crew with a guy from the food network reviewing the place when we ate there. Prompt service, excellent specialty drinks. This place is a must. Get reservations a day or two in advance, otherwise you'll be sitting outside."}
{"text":"One of the best carnitas tacos I've had. The atmosphere is nice but make sure to have a reservation or be prepared to wait a while. I luckily was able to find a spot at the bar, and the margaritas were really good with interesting flavors. I got the carnitas tacos and the korean tacos. Both were extremely filling and really tasty. I would come back here, but make sure to be hungry when you come!"}
{"text":"Welp. I don't think I have ever been so pumped to try a new restaurant before than I was when I saw Tako opened, and was getting rave review. I've been waiting patiently to get the right time to get everyone together. Finally got around to it last weekend.   I gotta say, I was SO underwhelmed. We walked in and were promptly seated per our reservations, but it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come say hi. Long enough that we paroozed the menu and already picked out what we wanted. We ordered drinks; one was a mixed drink which was TOO strong of a drink.  Secondly, the tacos were good but not that expensive good. I know a lot of people really enjoyed it, but I just don't think it's my taste."}
{"text":"Tako is one of the few exceptions where Asian Fusion is at it's best and worth the price.  Their Tako Taco is phenomenal; the grilled octopus is perfectly complemented with the chickpeas and creamy aioli. Their full menu is such a great fusion of Asian flavors (yuzu, soy, ginger, shishito, etc.) into each of their tacos and also margaritas (El Diablo is my favorite)!  Often hard to get a seat, but I would suggest walking in with a small party (2-3) and waiting to seat at the bar. Otherwise, be ready to book reservations at odd hours or at least a month in advance."}
{"text":"Well, everyone...I just ate the best taco I've ever had in my life.  I had been looking forward to coming to tako for months. My expectations were basically through the roof by the time I got there after all the praises I had heard for the food, so I was hoping it wouldn't disappoint. Let me tell you...it didn't! Tako is extremely small, but the atmosphere is so, so cool. You honestly feel like you're stepping into a different world when you enter; you completely forget that you're in downtown Pittsburgh. The lighting is pretty dark, but it really sets the mood. There are only about seven tables on the ground floor, and then a few more tables up on a second floor loft. I love the fact that the kitchen is right at the front of the restaurant, so you can see the chefs making all the delicious food. The music is a little loud and I felt that I was almost yelling to talk to my friends, but the food was so good I didn't even care.  We started with a round of drinks - we all got either the red or white sangria. I tasted both, and would highly recommend the red over the white, even if you're partial to white wine. The red sangria had a lot more depth of flavor than the white. Next, we did the \"build your own guac,\" which was basically my dream come true as guacamole is one of my favorite foods of all time. We did the classic guacamole and added bacon to it. One of the best guacs I've ever had. Also, the chips were phenomenal and came out piping hot and very fresh. Next we put in an order of the famous \"papas bravas,\" which I noticed a few people had mentioned on Yelp. Oh my goshhhh they were PHENOMENAL. The potatoes themselves were crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. There was some sort of tangy sauce on the bottom of the skillet with a hint of sweetness, and the aioli on top was more salty. Top that off with some scallions, and I was in heaven. I was so happy at that point that I would have given tako five stars even before trying the tacos.  I was tempted to order the octopus taco, but I decided to try the chicken since it was my first time and I wanted to see tako's take on the classic chicken taco. Oh man. I was already pretty full from our appetizers, but I scarfed both of my tacos down in record time. The mixture of the flavors is just amazing, and no one flavor overpowers any other. I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life, but these were the best tacos I've ever had. I am not exaggerating. If you haven't been here yet, please make a reservation and try it out ASAP. Your tummy will thank you!"}
{"text":"They have the BEST gourmet guacamole and tacos. Food is prepared fresh-appreciate that. Atmosphere and wait staff were trendy. Make sure to make a reservation though or you could wait up to 45 min-only downfall of this place. I am from Texas and staying around the corner from this place and just wanted to try this spot that was rated so high on Yelp."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy tacos. Got the ceviche with homemade chips to start, pretty delicious.. for tacos we got the carnitas and Korean tacos. Both very delicious. Overall this was a cool spot to check out.. Nice ambiance and trendy decor.."}
{"text":"Visited here expecting an incredible meal and tako certainly delivered just that!   The spicy passion fruit margarita was sweet, tangy, and spicy! Very delicious. For the meal, we had the original \"tako\" taco, which is an octopus taco and also the special, which was an Asian inspired pork belly taco. The octopus was so tender; you never would've known it was octopus! The fried chickpeas on it were also delicious. But I must say, the pork belly taco blew it out of the park!! It was cooked perfectly, the veggies were crisp and tangy, the kimchi was a perfect addition to the rock pork belly, and the sweet miso glaze paired well! Overall, the tacos were great.   We also had the street corn, which was rich and good for sharing! The queso fundido was also delicious, and was also topped with their homemade chorizo and peppers that were delectable! The only complaint was that there a little bit too much cilantro on the queso, but that can be easily overlooked with all the other amazing qualities of the meal. The service was awesome as well!!! Definitely will go back and would recommend to anyone looking to try unique, delicious, and interesting good in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Delicious food and outstanding service.  Chicken and pork tacos were amazing.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Cheesecake dessert was very good."}
{"text":"Top 3 best tacos I've ever eaten. We took the option to get 4 different tacos for one price and ordered everything on the menu. Left completely stuffed and full out of our minds. Also, don't skip the guac. We ordered the bacon blue cheese and it was incredible. It wasn't just guac, then they crumble the cheese and bacon over top, it was actually mixed in, so every bite was full if flavor. The place books up incredibly fast, so make sure you make your reservation as quickly as you can for a great meal"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the drink varieties, our bartender was awesome! This place is packed!!! Make a reservation in advance if you can. If not, prepare to stalk other patrons' bar seats! Well worth the wait though. The Korean Tacos I had were fantastic with the right amount of spiciness, not to mention HUGE. Highly recommend the Spicy Passionfruit and El Diablo as drink options if you like some heat with your alcohol. One of the best parts of my stay in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Tako recently changed their menu, and not for the better. First of all, they removed my favorite taco, the Baja taco :( and the only similar choice is a shrimp taco that costs $17 for a pair. Speaking of which, they've also raised their prices ridiculously high. The octopus (tako) taco now costs over $20, which I think is pretty absurd. Although their food was still good, I think they made some poor decisions in changing their menu pricing. Their business has definitely declined as well - when we were leaving around 730pm on a Friday, there were several empty tables. Hopefully they make some improvements soon!"}
{"text":"Okay why didn't I try this place earlier? This is definitely on the top of my list for favorite Pittsburgh restaurants now. Everything I tried from appetizer to main course is delicious. I ordered queso and street corn for appetizers. Umm every bite is magical haha not even kidding. For tacos, I tried three different tacos. I had duck, shrimp tempura, and baja tacos. They're all excellent, idk how to explain but they're all different and good in their own way. My favorite one is definitely the duck taco tho if I have to pick. Mmmm I'm definitely coming back in a week or two. My tummy is happy now."}
{"text":"Great experience for our weekend visit! I made our reservations a few weeks in advance after reading an article in the local magazine highlighting the best spots in town. You all did not disappoint.  Design down sides: The host station is positioned so that the employees back faces the customer upon entry. The ambiance felt a bit kitschy. Super dark, red lights, steam punk, Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, the two top tables near the bar are not intimate but create a feeling of separateness and sterility, especially since I like my husband and want to be with him. He just came over to the bench side and we squeezed together so we could actually date.   Design upsides: The live DJ was a phenomenal touch, but be prepared to sit close to hear your date. Though it was raining the curbside window seating by the kitchen was fun and inviting. The upstairs ceiling light fixtures were creative and artistic, using old doors and Edison bulbs.  The Mezcal Smash was unique and well composed. The smoked salt was a fantastic touch to the just right sweetness of the margarita. I also enjoyed the Oaxaca Old Fashioned. Totally different experience but enjoyable and worth trying.  We ordered build your own guacamole the Tako grilled octopus tacos and the Duck Confit tacos. Every last bite was delicious. It is clear the chefs have put passion and thought into each option. The flavors and textures were complex and complimented each other without taking up too much palette space.   It is easy to make tacos but what has happened here is the playful creation of a separate food group. We were delighted to continually find interesting culinary twists on a staple food. Well done! We'll be back"}
{"text":"It's a we'll know fact that my boyfriend Ewan McGregor was a regular while in town. Sadly I'd never been at the same time he was. Not hard to figure out why he likes it so much. First the concept and design are so cool. Urban chic is you will. Modern and fun. The drinks are some of the best cocktails you can get in the city. But the food, omg the food.. Baja tacos  make me feel like I've been catapulted to the moon and back. The flavors are so intense. Chips and salsa are also a must."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the more fun and innovative places to eat in Pittsburgh right now. Great bar, wonderful tacos! Reservations very required, but worth it before or after cultural events Downtown!  It can get really loud in there, which is the only downside I've experienced after eating there twice."}
{"text":"Top notch service, food, beverages, atmosphere.  Korean Tacos are a must. Kale is excellent for a lighter choice, spicy passion fruit Margarita is amazing.  Went two nights in a row. Make a reservation to be safe."}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  We've been wanting to eat here for a while, but often our plans are last minute and this place is always packed.  We were lucky early last Saturday night and scored a table outside.  It wasn't too cold yet and they had heaters set up.  I love the guacamole - they start with a base and then have a list of items to mix in, sort of like you find at ice cream shops.  We tried blue cheese and mango.  While it was good, the blue cheese was a bit strong for the guac, but that's really our fault for selecting it.  I definitely want to try new combinations.  We had a Poke which is raw (sushi) tuna with delicious lime foam on crispy rice crackers.  A couple of the rice crackers had stuck together and were a tad oily, but it didn't detract from the dish.  At the recommendation of our server we had Korean Beef Tacos.  All I can say is Yum!  The Neville Island Ice Tea was a nice twist on the drinks and I also had a seasonal pumpkin margarita.  While it was good, there wasn't much pumpkin flavor.    Pittsburgh needs more places like this.  Great food, great atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  I can't wait to bring some out of town visitors so they can taste the new Pittsburgh restaurant scene.    Taking in to account atmosphere, quality, and price, this could be the best restaurant in the city.  If there is a downside, its only that the food is so good its always packed.  Be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"It is a hipsters paradise. Every element of the place, from the ambience to the hand selected staff, to the presentation of the food... Hipster. I consider myself to have a sensitive palette. Some combinations work and some don't. Sesame seaweed, soy sauce and tuna belly on guacamole was not it. Now, I am not one to complain about tuna belly but that combination was a bit much.   The Korean tacos were fantastic and the variety of textures right down to the pickled cucumber slices(not your average pickle) was truly a party in my mouth. I enjoyed it. The staff was accommodating and the manager knowing we were in town for a short while got us a table even though they were booked out for weeks. Thanks for the great Pittsburgh experience, täko!"}
{"text":"Well, they've done it again... did you think they wouldn't? They, being Richard Deshantz and Tolga Sevdik, owners of Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye. I'm not joking when I say they've got this down to a science. Cook awesome food, offer a hip environment, great cocktails and you win.  I've been there a handful of times already, always sitting at the bar. Why? Because their cocktails are killer, yes, but also because I never think to make a reservation, which you must do at least two weeks in advance (maybe even three if you want a weekend date).   It's TINY, like really tiny! half the size of Butcher and maybe offering about 20 tables. So that's why you have to wait for a table and make a reservation. But TOTALLY worth it! The taco's aren't priced too bad, in my opinion. They're hardy and you get 2 for around $10ish. My fave so far... the mushroom taco. Sounds weird, but it was so delicious. The best way to experience a mushroom in my opinion. So good... I seriously dream about this taco!   I've also had their gauc, which come in various forms that you can choose from. I went with the classic, and while it was good, it's a tiny portion for around $8. I probably scooped half the bowl on one chip, which is partly my fault!   I'm excited to finally sit at a table soon, so watch out for a full dinner recap soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for dinner and had a great experience. Mai tai and spicy cucumber Marg for drinks were both delicious in their own right. Questions fundido as an app -- not what we expected, but delicious nonetheless. She ordered pollo tacos, I ordered bistec tacos -- both incredibly delicious and perfect proportions. We Finished up with funnel cake with ice cream.  For the amount of food ordered, we finished it all and didn't feel like hell afterwards. On top of all of that, Justin's service was outstanding. We will be definitely frequenting going forward."}
{"text":"Very good.  Wonderful flavors.  Four of us tried appetizers of chicharons and chicken wings and then the Bistecca, Tako, Korean and Baja.  All excellent.  Prices a bit high.  Music was way too loud.  Definitely some place you should try."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while. The most amazing Baja and mushroom tacos along with one of the best desserts I've had in a while - Tres Leches. The ambiance sets the mood just right as well. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is sub-standard. The prices here are crazy for the tacos they serve ($15 for two carne asada tacos with minimal meat and toppings, $7 for chips). The bar was so packed we couldn't even get a seat at 11:30pm. We asked the hostess for a table, and although multiple tables were open, she said they were reserved (we stayed for 20 mins, no one ever sat in those tables). We asked her if we could sit outside, but she said no because of our drinks. Bottom line: the place is packed, sub-standard and overpriced. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Mexican or Latin inspired cuisine is one of my favorites but it's often difficult to find great representations of it in Pittsburgh, however this restaurant does not disappoint...the food is amazing, especially the tacos!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars based on the fact that I've never gotten to eat in-store. It's always been takeout due to small space and minimal seating. However, the tacos were great! I had the octopus and my boyfriend always gets different types of meat. I'm not a fan of mexican food but these tacos really take the traditional food to the next level. Really enjoy the fun and interesting twist on otherwise common food."}
{"text":"This place struck a little bit below expectations, but was still very good as far as taco places go. I would definitely get a reservation as the place was packed on a Sunday evening. One good thing is that they do seem to take reservation blocks seriously. We were seated immediately when we arrived for our time and were asked to leave after 1.5 hours to allow for the next reservation. May not be the best place for extended drinks and catching up with friends, but at least the reservations are timely.   They offer a wide selection of cocktails and Mexican beers. The guacamole was tasty, but the portion size is rather small and they give you about 3x the amount of chips you could eat for the guac. Not sure if it's worth the $14.  These tacos on the other hand are above average in serving size for a taco. I would say 2-3 tacos is pretty filling for the average person. Orders come with 2 each and we ended up getting the 'Big Board' which comes with 6 orders of tacos.  - Steak tacos: nice flavor but rather chewy and tough beef - Shrimp tempura: nice crispy shrimp. Not much I would change - pastor: my friend had this one but I didn't try it. Apparently very very salty and the pineapples were clearly straight from a can or something. Def not flavored or grilled.  - octopus: interesting flavor. Comes topped with again, what tastes like grapefruit straight out of a fruit cup. Octopus tasted over cooked and tough.  - Korean: probably my favorite one. Beef was tender and well marinated with a nice contrast of pickled cucumbers on top."}
{"text":"TAKO is good. prepare to be in line but it is worth it. Had dinner on a Saturday night and late lunch on a Sunday (opens at 3). sizeable tacos, fresh ingredients, guacamole for all tastes, prepared with the ingredients you want. All kinds of tequila and bar tenders super nice, no attitude. The same owner has 2 (soon to be 3) other restaurants in town...meat and potatoes, Butcher and the rye, super good as well. you cannot go wrong,..and area is CLEAN."}
{"text":"My mushroom taco knocked my socks off, but the restaurant struck me as pretentious. There is no reason any Pittsburgh restaurant needs a DJ in a full-on, club-style DJ cage, and music so loud that all dinner conversation devolves into a frustrating game of charades because speaking words is impossible.  Like Butcher and the Rye, the too-squished-together tables at tako intensify the awkwardness of the meal and difficulty of all communications with both your dinner partner and the wait staff.  I've enjoyed Deshantz's other restaurants, especially Meat and Potatoes, but tako seems more concerned with being trendy in da Club than with making a comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"The short version; hip decor and music, good staff, great food - would come back for sure.  Without reservation, was able to get seated within 5 minutes on the Wednesday before New Year's Eve.  To wait for a few here is a treat, as they have a very unique setup where 3 walls of the kitchen are behind glass (facing inside the dining room/bar, the foyer, and the street) - always love places that expose the kitchen to the guests.  The newspaper menu is quite creative, seems to be a growing a trend which I'm a fan.  I also liked how simple it is, maybe 8 or so appetizers and about the same for the tacos with some daily specials for consideration.  Drinks were awesome, the oxaca old fashioned is small but packed punch and flavor, same for the Diablo margarita (bigger, 8-10 oz drink).  We started with a recommended guacamole which had tuna and some Asian flavoring which was delicious and portion matches the price.  Tacos were all good, however the house special octopus and the bistec were superior.  Only stumble was the last round of drinks came out slowly and did not seem to be a function of volume of people at the bar.  Minor blemish in and otherwise very good experience.  Pittsburgh price '$$' seem inconsistent to me, if it helps I got an app, 4 tacos and 5 drinks for ~$130."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. Great elotes. Love the make your own guac. Margs are great too. Never had a bad experience. There's a reason why you have to make a reservation ~1 month in advance - because it's the best."}
{"text":"The food is an amazing fusion mix of an astonishing number of cultures, with substantial portions. The octopus tacos were amazing, the mushroom ones less so but still good.  I didn't really care for their highly touted \"Street Corn\", though.  It was kind of a strange version of creamed corn, both too spicy and too bland, if that makes any sense; the texture was just kind of weird, and we both opted to send it back.  If something is too spicy for me, then you know it's over the top.  I still want to go back and try other things, and definitely have the octopus tacos again. The drinks were also very good.  Service was fairly good, but a little slow.  My dining companion has a lot of dietary issues, and the waitress seemed a little annoyed by her many questions and need for changes, and our ultimately still having some issues with the food (see \"Street Corn\" above), but did accommodate us.    I actually had to go downstairs a couple of times to get the waitress because things were so slow, and being upstairs, there was no way to flag anyone down. This was definitely not so much fun because I've got mobility issues and use a cane (not to mention that no one should *ever* have to get up to go find the waiter/waitress), but no one ever came upstairs to check on anyone eating there unless they were actually serving something.  We also had to grab one of the other waiters and ask him to go get our waitress.  If you want a regular table, though, you have to sit upstairs, where there are booths.  Downstairs, it is just tall tables with barstool-height seats, or you can sit outside either at a table on the sidewalk or one of just a couple of stools at the window.  That's fine when the weather is good, but neither are an option when it's raining or cold.  The bathroom is wheelchair accessible, but unfortunately, it would be almost impossible to get through the forest of bar tables on the first floor in a wheelchair to even get to it.    There is no way on earth a person in a wheelchair is going to be able to actually eat at any of the tables on the first floor, either, and certainly no way to get to the second floor, which is served only by stairs, as with far too many other Pittsburgh establishments.  Unfortunately, there is also not enough room to install an elevator, so it is what it is.  They really need to put at least one or two regular tables towards the front of the first floor in order to be in compliance with both the ADA and reasonable consideration for the range of clientele who would like to be able to eat there, though.    Even with those, it would be unpleasant to get through the sea of barstools to the restroom in a wheelchair, because no one likes to be eye level with a bunch of other people's knees and crotches, looking up at the underside of tables.    It's not just people in wheelchairs, either; the elderly and otherwise infirm will also have trouble getting upstairs, and those of us who are vertically-challenged will all have trouble with the barstools as well, even if fully mobile.  They are not conducive for almost *anyone* to have a leisurely meal, but truly completely impossible for anyone who is not tall and agile.  It's also freaking *dark* in there, especially upstairs, which is lovely for atmosphere, but makes it very difficult to read the menu, even for people with good vision.  My older visually-impaired cousin and I both had to pull out our phones and use the lights on them, and we both had trouble actually seeing our food.  It's lighter downstairs, but again, there is the problem with the seating there.    I don't know if they have braille menus or not.  I didn't ask, but it seems unlikely, given the lighting situation, which shows no more attention to visual impairments than the seating does to mobility impairments.  It's definitely a trendy place, but the food is really excellent, and there are a whole lot of older and disabled people in this town who are very interested in eating at unusual spots, with plenty of money with which to do so.  Tako just doesn't seem to have taken any of us who are not tall and perfectly fit into consideration at all, which is a really major turnoff.  It's right across the street from Heinz Hall, and is open late, so it's perfect for dining either before or after the theater anywhere in the Cultural District.  We had tickets at Heinz Hall, and had left ourselves a good bit of time, but we did end up being a little rushed, so definitely leave yourself even more extra time than you think you will actually need.  As always, one star off just for being utterly inaccessible, and another mostly for the slow service."}
{"text":"Lucked out and got a 6:45 pm dinner reservation. Ordered a variety of food - from the standard menu and the specials menu. Started with the tuna tartare (special) and chorizo/goat cheese/pepitas guacamole (not special menu). Both were outstanding. The tartare was fresh and light. The guacamole was packed with flavor - spicy, salty, and sweet from the raw onion on top.  Please do yourself a favor and get the octopus tacos - seriously one of the best things I've eaten in years. The duck tacos were also outstanding, but a little too much hoisin. The pork belly tacos, from the specials menu, were dry.  The only complaint was that it was a little hard to have a conversation because the bass was bumping. But a fantastic meal.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here at 9:30 on a Saturday, and although the food was well executed the atmosphere and service made the experience an overall negative one. Almost everyone that worked there seemed exhausted and overwhelmed which is understandable given how dark, loud, and impossible to get around it was. We waited for about 15 mins to be asked about our drinks, and were able to order everything then. As I said, all of the food was very good as we had expected, but they need to make some overall adjustments to make this a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Tako is a smash hit. The atmosphere is so classy and the vibe is really something neat. The tacos are out of this world and the margaritas and cocktails are strong as hell. Expect to spend $100 for two people but at the end of the night you will have realized it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Täk? for a very long time. Everyone I knew was raving about the atmosphere and the food. Let me tell you, it lives up to the hype! I had a drink that the bartender recommended (can't remember the name now! ): ) that was amazing! The appetizers, chips and salsa, were great! I tried four salsa and chips, each salsa was unique and delicious. The chorizo was excellent!! Cannot recommend enough!"}
{"text":"First impression - incredible! The flavor profiles of the tacos (two per order), the tableside-made guacamole, the cocktails...it all added up for a memorable night even if we could barely see (or hear!) each other in the dimly lit balcony, bumpin' with bass a la house DJ. Reality set in on the the long overdue second visit. Yes, the taco options still juxtapose diverse flavors, but the wow factor just wasn't there. After almost a year, their signature taco had become legend, but on this go around it fell short - the preserved lemon and mizuna greens were too dominant. Their was also a Lenten menu available this visit, and you would think $24 halibut tacos would be blissful, but shame on you täk? - bland, Bland, BLAND! Utter disappointment. The winner of the evening was the special shrimp tacos - hell yes to crispy, spicy and Asian flavors! Service at our bar area table was adequate and the food was timely. Decor is sharp + chic, but the lighting could still use a bump up on the dimmers. Nonetheless...seek out täk?, revel in the flourishing 4-1-2 food scene and mingle with the young 'n hip at midnight because that's probably the only time you can get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Don't leave this place without trying the Tako Taco. Didn't know octopus can taste that good. My next favorite is the Pastor (Pork) Taco. Price is on the high side."}
{"text":"Great and fun scene if you can get a table. You can watch the tacos, guac, and all other food assembled right in front of you. The drink selection is also diverse and delicious. The food was well prepared and tasty, but definitely a little underseasoned."}
{"text":"Was told by by employee that they had high chairs and opened at 5:00 pm at about 4:45. So my wife, 14 month old daughter and myself stood in the sun for almost 20 minutes to be told by a guy in a suit that reservations were needed and there were no high chairs available with a smirk on his face. Extremely unprofessional. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The drinks were nice and strong.   It's too loud-turn down the music!!!"}
{"text":"I brought my friends from out of town to Tako after a bat mitzvah, thinking it would be a great atmosphere to show off Pittsburgh. This was not the experience we had. After sitting down at the bar with my friend to order a drink, I asked if there were any drink specials. My friend and I were then told to look at the menu. Which didn't answer my question. We then were told to sit at the tables. We sat at the tables, as directed by the servers, and my group was passed over several times. A server approached us. We asked for drink menus, as it was already midnight and we were done with food and wanted to continue drinking. We were never brought menus. We were not treated with fair service and after spending 20 minutes in an atmosphere that we should have walked out of, we were finally brought waters we asked for upon arriving. I understand that this may have been an isolated incident. I wanted to show my out of town friends a good time, and considering this did not happen, I don't know if I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"If you want mega fancy tacos and interesting tequila cocktails, this is definitely the spot to go. The atmosphere feels very club-like, with a live DJ, the lights down low, and a large crowd. I ordered the octopus tacos, while my dinner pal ordered the duck/foie gras tacos. Both were delicious! I'd never eaten octopus and was pretty surprised when my taco came with full tentacles. The cocktails are fantastic as well; I really liked the watermelon basil margarita. Service was great, even though we were a super late 10:45 reservation. Definitely a good splurge spot."}
{"text":"The food is very good, however I was really upset with the staff. The hostess was rude and made me sit at the bar because I was alone instead of a table like I wanted. The bar tender made several mistakes with food and kept asking what people ordered. The kitchen staff are having more fun with each other than focusing on producing food for customers.   I would have given them 5 stars, but too many staff mistakes. I loved the food, but I believe in being treated with respect and customer appreciation so I will not return or recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Everything from my the appetizers to the deserts was actually markedly better than any other restaurant that I've ever been to. They showed true talent in cocktail making, subtlety in making traditional dishes like guacamole and ceviche but with a clear attention to detail that brought every amazing flavor out, and absolute mastery of deserts that is seldom seen in a restaurant with such high quality main courses. Every element of this meal was expertly crafted, the interior design was amazing and the service was impeccable. If you have only one night to go out in Pittsburgh, spend it here."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant. We arrived Sunday evening 15 minutes ahead of the reservation time and were promptly seated inside. The decor is sweet. The music and dim lighting aren't my thing, but nothing to complain about. We told the server that it was our first time here, scoured the menu, and ordered drinks/apps/tacos without fuss. Drinks arrived within 5 minutes--frozen margaritas--and were excellent. Things quickly ground to a halt after that.   Essentially, we waited 40 minutes for the first glimpse of food to show up--the famed Papa Bravas. Once it did, it looked and tasted like charcoal secondary to how burnt it was. I try not to exaggerate, but the potatoes were thoroughly black. Our server was polite and affable; he acknowledged that they were quite burnt, apologized, and offered to get us another quick appetizer as we waited for the entrees to come out. We took up his suggestion and got the #1 guacamole instead.   We munched on chips and guac for a while. Eventually the tacos arrived, approximately 1 hour after we showed up. The folks two tables down had been seated later than us, and by this point had already enjoyed their apps, drinks and tacos. I'd definitely recommend what we got, the octopus and grilled scallops. But it's hard to fully enjoy food when you're feeling antsy and overlooked. We scarfed these down and requested the check. They kindly comped us for the burnt Papa Bravas, and charged for the guac instead. Thanks, I guess...?   I never fully realized how important timing was to a good food experience. Beyond that, I suppose I was tremendously surprised that someone had prepared one of the restaurant's most popular dishes, saw how burnt it looked, and decided to plate and serve it anyway.  It'll be hard to find a reason to come back. With all the excellent reviews of täk? on Yelp, our ho hum experience won't make or break this already-thriving restaurant. I can only suggest for the future that like in any effective relationship, more open and honest communication may be helpful to change the course and mood of a dining experience gone sour."}
{"text":"Having been to, and subsequently fallen in love with chef Richard DeShantz' two other offerings in downtown (i.e. Butcher and the Rye, Meat and Potatoes) AND after waiting two weeks on the waitlist, expectations were no doubt set high for DeShantz' third installment, Tako. Boy, were my expectations exceeded.   ATMOSPHERE: 5/5 Tucked away between the aforementioned Butcher and the Rye and a corner CVS and across the street from the beautiful Heinz Hall, Tako illuminates the area with a vintage sign proclaiming their offerings: beer, tequila, A/C, and tacos. Directly underneath the sign is a unique sight for downtown, with a street-front kitchen and 5 stools for guests to sit at should they prefer to dine along the bustling 6th ave. Once inside, restaurant-goers will be delighted by the eclectic decor of the place: marquee letter signs spelling out TEQUILA, a giant octopus (täk? means octopus in japanese) mural, and a second floor lined with beautiful Spanish railing, all dimly lit by an array of quirky edison bulbs and velvet colored chandeliers. The open kitchen and and impressive tequila bar surround the place and ensure that, no matter where you sit, there's always something to look at. Even if you arrive earlier than the rest of your party, it's nice to simply sit and enjoy the ambiance.  LIBATIONS: 5/5 As a big time tequila drinker, I was ecstatic at the site of the large selection of tequilas and mezcals that Tako offers. I ordered a glass of mezcal after the waiter helped me choose one I haven't tried from their unique collection. My girlfriend ordered their 'El Diablo' margarita and it was a perfect mix of sweet and spice. I'll have to come back to try some of their other creative cocktails, the woman at the table next to us told us she was loving her Oaxaca Old Fashioned.  FOOD: 5/5 We ordered the obligatory guac & chips to start, opting to build our own with mango, bacon, cotija cheese, sesame and pumpkin seeds. The guac was no doubt delicious, and our ingredient choices were spot on despite some hesitance on our part, since there were so many toppings to choose from. I would have preferred more avocado personally :)  Next was a special of the night, duck quesadillas. It came no sooner than we had finished our guac. Topped with mole and quacking good, these little guys made for a great appetizer.  Once done with our appetizer, our two taco orders arrived. Served on a giant wooden slab with the restaurant's name etched into it and a gutter in the middle to keep the massive tacos together, the presentation was impeccable. The first taco was the Korean. Very similar in flavor to a Chinese chicken salad (replace the chicken with juicy wagyu of course), sweet savory and a hint of spice. The next taco was the chorizo, which I was less fond of since I have a very very low spice tolerance. The egg on top was a nice, slightly sweet addition. My girlfriend loved both however so those who can handle a bit of heat can't go wrong.   Overall it was a great experience as one would expect from this class of restaurants. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I want to start with I typically love tako and will still continue to dine there but I do want to voice my concern about my dinner tonight. I have dined with you several times and have always enjoyed it, however tonight was very upsetting. I had one of the featured items on the menu which was the smoked mushroom taco. I love love love mushrooms so I was very excited about this feature. However, I am extremely sensitive to spicy food. The menu listed smoked mushrooms, feta and cashew pesto and a mojo sauce (please forgive me of this is a little incorrect). All of this sounded amazing! As I took my first bite I was like ok something is a little spicy... I then had my second bite and my lips were tingly and my mouth was on fire. I asked the bartender what could be spicy and he had mentioned it had habanero on it. This is something I would have stayed away from or asked to not have it if I have known because I am extremely sensitive to spicy food. My husband who loves spicy food agreed it was a bit much. I unfortunately had to give him my second taco because I couldn't eat it. All i am suggesting is that the menu descriptions are a little more defined. Not everyone likes spicy peppers."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. The atmosphere was perfect. Such a cool mix of classy yet urban street vibe. From the dim lighting and unique light fixtures, to the balcony railing and booths upstairs ... It all just made the dining experience that much better.   But most importantly, the food. The guacamole MTO menu was awesome. We got the traditional guac with just one added item and it was delicious. The papas bravas were also a 10. Perfectly cooked, not too spicy, with just the right amount of some sort of special sauce on top. Last, the pollo asada tacos had so much flavor. For two fairly small tortillas, they packed so much inside and the flavor combination was great.   Lastly, the cocktail of the day was a frozen margarita with cinnamon and fireball, which also exceeded my expectations.   If I only had room for dessert... I would have ordered the churros funnel cake. I guess I'll have to go back again?"}
{"text":"Tako is a trendy restaurant with a lovely ambiance. Think dimly lit space with a fully stocked bar that runs across the length of the restaurant. It's a bit hidden as they do not have any door sign, but you know you're there when you see the large doormat with letters adorning the restaurant's name. You'll know you're at the right place when you enter and see the glass which reveals the huge open kitchen to your right.   The guacamole here is a must. How many places do you go to that let you customize your own guacamole?! There's so many options to choose from such as pineapple, jicama, mango, bacon, crabmeat, smoked salmon - there's really no way that you can wrong!  Now on to the tacos. Tako really knows how to make a mean taco. We ordered the following:  - Al pastor (pork shoulder) with pineapple, onion, avocado salsa and cilantro - Korean short rib with fermented cucumber, napa cabbage, peanuts and cilantro - Blackened fish with onions, peppers, avocado crema, and cilantro   My favorite by far was the korean short ribs taco. The short ribs were perfectly seasoned and the cucumbers helped to cut the grease from the meat. And of course the peanuts added a nice crunch to it. The blackened fish, which was one of the specials of the night, was a close runner up. All tacos come in two per order.   One of my faves in Pittsburgh! I'm already planning another trip back here!"}
{"text":"Delicious but super pricy for a taco. (As an FYI, it's really dark inside and can be kinda hard to read the many)"}
{"text":"Always good tacos. Not a fan of the seviche or octopus. Good guacamole. Great combinations and flavors. Lots of tequila to try! Make a reservation or sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the atmostphere is fun. It does get a little loud, but if you go in with that expectation you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Interesting mix of tasty food, good drink, nice service and strong energy. Food was terrific. Taco don't disappoint. Great flavor. More than adequate portions. Service has always been helpful. The place is visually interesting. It's a bit loud for some-music and people. This may not be a place to bring your young children."}
{"text":"Food:  Service:  There aren't enough tables to handle the crowds. You can try making a reservation or going right when they open at 5 PM! They open some outdoor seating in the summer which helps a lot. Besides the tacos, their queso ia ro die for and the cocktails are great as well! Highly recommended...if you can find a seat..."}
{"text":"Okay....finally found a reservation at a time that is not close to midnight and on a weekday in the holiday season. I was so excited to be there after all the reviews I read on Yelp and the hype my friends created. However, both me and my friend felt this place is overrated after finishing our tacos. Here are more details.  The interior is definitely different from a regular restaurant in Pittsburgh. I remember visiting restaurants with this dimly lit, sophisticated themed interior when I visited New York city. Maybe part of the hype is due to the interior. Our server was nice and the service was quick though the place was packed.   We started with Papas Bravas - fried potatoes served over tomatoe sauce and topped with roasted garlic mayo and green onions. These are definitely the best fried potatoes that I had in a while and it was a good quantity for 2 people. I highly recommend this one. It also has a nice aroma when they bring it to your table.   For entree, we ordered 2 varieties of tacos - Pollo Asado and Shishito. Pollo Asado is lime marinated chicken taco served with avacado and other garnishing items. I did not find any lime flavor in the chicken. It is bland and lacked seasoning for my preference. My friend like the Shishito tacos, but again I did not get the well seasoned flavor profile I was expecting. I wish they offered a wedge of lime on the side for the tacos.   For dessert, we ordered tres leches. I had tres leches in the past and it was way softer and fluffier than the ones I had here. However, the taste is good. Not too sweet and it is good quantity for the price. Entire plate screamed holiday theme with a heavy pumpkin spice flavor.   I recommend this place if you are interested in a different sophisticated restaurant experience for eating tacos."}
{"text":"So glad we were able to get a table here with no reservations just before 7pm on a Sunday night. It was packed shortly after. The ambiance, service, and food were on point!  The poke was fresh and had some great flavor combinations as well as different textures. Went great with the shrimp chips it came with.  Queso fundido had the traditional Mexican taste with a lil twist of Japanese fusion with the addition of shishito peppers. Came with delicious handmade flour tortillas.  Thrice cooked wings were amazing! Delicious flavor with the fish sauce base, and were super crispy.  Al pastor tacos - meat was delicious and tender. Was a bit weary of the pineapples, but everything went together very well. Wrapped with their awesome handmade tortillas.  Dessert - cheesecake was not what you would expect in a cheesecake. It was more like a deconstructed cheesecake, but the flavors were amazing and hit the spot. Homemade vanilla ice cream and blueberry sauce. Berries were fresh and tasty. Only thing missing from this dessert was the crust.  Damien was our server, and he was great! Very attentive and had great recommendations."}
{"text":"Went in with high hopes and left feeling underwhelmed.  My hubby and I waited about 2 months to get a Friday night reservation here. Upon arriving, we were kind of turned off by the atmosphere- there's a DJ playing mind-numbingly loud house music and it's so dark we could barely see our menus. All that aside, we are obsessed with Mexican food and couldn't wait to try this place out.   Our waiter suggested crab guacamole, which sounded awesome, but was $16? And after seeing the small serving size at a table next to us, w opted for the traditional gauc ($11). It was good, not great. We wanted to try a few different tacos but were disappointed to find you can't mix and match, so we just went for it and ordered the octopus, Baja, and mushroom to share. The waiter told my hubby to eat the octopus first because it has the shortest \"shelf life\"... okay, no problem.   Within a few minutes, the fish and mushroom taco boards arrived at our table.. the octopus took another 4-5 minutes or so... kinda hard to eat those ones first! Also- we still hadn't received our drink orders by the time the food arrived. My husband loved the octopus, but the other tacos were just OKAY for both of us. Certainly not the best fish tacos I've had. The mushroom were okay.. Im just not crazy about the type of mushrooms used- they are huge and meaty (which some people might enjoy) but Im just not a fan of the texture.  All in all, the experience was average, or slightly below for an $80 bill. 6 tacos, guacamole and 2 drinks... I'm glad we tried it, but I don't see what all the hype is all about.   Bakersfield continues to be our absolute favorite for Mexican fusion in the Pgh area."}
{"text":"This place is just great. I'd heard a ton of hype, so I actually went in assuming that it would not live up to expectations. I was wrong. The hype is all true. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, interesting drink selections and delicious food are all included at this restaurant. It's tiny, but full of so many great things!  The watermelon basil and jalapeño margaritas were both unique and delicious. Chips and guacamole were pretty standard-nothing special there-but then came the carnitas taco!  Wow!!  A delicious flavor bomb full of tender meat, texture and spice. Yum!!  Bar staff were adequate, but were lacking on personality and were heard complaining that our party didn't order enough drinks."}
{"text":"This is a review I dread writing. I LOVE so many things about tako but so many thing were BAD during our last visit.  This is our most up to date impression.   So upon past experiences, we tried to make a conscious effort to refrain from over ordering. As much as we love our dogs; we are trying to cut back on the literal doggie bags going home. (The vet hasn't been very impressed with our mini dachshunds recent weight gain, Thank goodness our other two are mastiff breeds) And don't worry, the dogs did end up with tako leftovers.   So, we decided to order one apps, drinks, & then tacos.  We have always loved the tacos & thought we would start with one order each and could always order more!   To begin with. The service was awkward. Upbeat and hip as one would expect from tako but items arrived without a flow that one would expect at tako. The chips took forever to arrive at our table. About a minute before our takos arrived. We had quite a long amount of time sipping on our artisanal drinks but they would have been much more enjoyable with the chips and house made salsas. Each salsa accompanying the chips were awesome. Three come with the chips. One mild, a medium, and a hot. Fresh ingredients mingling and hitting the tongue with not just heat but flavor & spice. It's amazing- Except when you really need a drink refill. And nobody returns to your table to offer another cocktail.   Water is available at the table, which is nice. Cocktail features being the star of the show at tako; it can be disappointing to settle on a glass of water when you really something like a hand pressed juiced drink to accompany the salty spiciness of their chips.  So the chips ended up being mostly abandoned and taken home in a literal doggie bag. Bummer.  This is why our small dog is fat.   As for the takos. I went with my favorite. Chicken. One of the tamer choices at tako. Typically the chicken takos are a beautiful mix of grilled chicken, avocado, salsa verde, cilantro, & onion but these ones weren't as warm as usual and just - eh. Still good but not what I was expecting. Again, a tako taco ended up going home for the dogs.   So. I still would suggest tako for a night out. It's good. The ambiance is almost too cool to function all the time. I can't say it's my favorite place. Which is disappointing because I was hoping for it to be THE MOST amazing place.  It's good. It's not my favorite at this point.  But it's fun and festive. Entertaining. My dogs really love their food!"}
