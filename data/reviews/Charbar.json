{"text":"I came here for lunch as it is close to my work and I found the food to be quite good although it took a while for it to arrive. The location is nice and you get a good view of the river depending on where you are seated. I'm told their dinner menu is quite a bit better so I can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"great concept. great service. great cocktails and great food. such an exciting addition to calgary. congrats on the opening."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant!   A fabulous place to hook up with friends for lunch, dinner or cocktails.  We decided to park and walk along the river and ended up at Charbar for lunch and a cocktail.  Love the location, the style of the restaurant the whole vibe.  We decided to split some appetizers and were very happy with our selection.   Our server was very attentive and provided great suggestions on items to try on the menu.  If you have not been you need to add it to your list of restaurants to try!"}
{"text":"The patio is probably the best in Calgary, with fantastic views of the river and downtown.  For scenery it's a 5-star.  But the food and service need some work.  The burger was excellent, but the sides were terrible.  I would have been happier with a side of Ms Vickie's potato chips than the bland and tiny portion that came along.  My friend ordered a side salad which was essentially the lettuce and tomato on the burger chopped up.  Hardly appealing.  Service was pleasant when it came by, but that was pretty rare.   This place has great potential, but I won't be going back unless it is just for drinks and a view seat on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent. Burger was sooooo good. Staff professional.  BIG thanks to Sebastian for the great service. Wonderful view. Give the place a go for sure!"}
{"text":"I had a work dinner at Charbar a few months ago and loved it. I took my husband there this week and somehow left loving it more.  Christmas party season is in full swing, so it was busy. But the service was very attentive, so it certainly didn't feel like they were being stretched. The food was delicious, as per usual. We had empanadas, tableside ceviche (a must) and oysters to start, and then split the porterhouse for our main. It did take a while for the porterhouse to come out - we didn't complain because it was a busy night with lots of groups, and we weren't in a rush (when it did come out, it was perfect). However, the staff recognized it as an issue - our server apologized, as did the shift lead. We assured them we didn't mind, but they gave us each a complementary dessert anyway. [The sundae is life-changing, by the way.]  To top it off, they called the day after to thank us for coming in. I love everything about this restaurant - the decor, the menu, the cocktails, and the service. Very excited that it is a cornerstone of East Village."}
{"text":"This is an incredible restaurant in a fantastic  building with such a beautiful view. The food is fantastic! The staff very helpful. I had 2 small children with me and they helped so much. The pizzas are terrific but the cerviche  is to die for!! You must drink the 'tigers milk' left in the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"Char Bar has a great atmosphere and great service however, we were disappointed to hear they ran out of pizza dough so we choose a few appetizers to be shared and I was not impressed. The eggplant and quinoa was overly fried and very, very salty even though I like salty foods. The cheese appetizer was sub par and did not have a lot of flavour and the bruschetta was pretty much the same- very bland. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary.  I was expecting kinks as it has only been open a short time, but there were none.  Everything was just delicious.  We had the chicken, and ordered extra chimmichurri sauce on the side (red).  We also shared the French fries and roasted broccoli.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This is probably my favorite restaurant in the city right now.  Service was excellent and decor was great too.  Fabulous location."}
{"text":"I sat on the patio, so I can't comment on the dining experience inside.  The patio setting is great. Very nice place to sit and have a drink. The patio menu is much different from the inside menu. This would be fine, but I don't understand why they chose to offer the food that they did. There is very little on here that is actually shareable, despite what the menu says. Legitimate tapas style patio food would be absolutely perfect in this setting.   I had the salt brick chicken sandwich -very nice- but it was accompanied by a side of kettle chips that were pretty clearly Ms. Vickies. I love kettle chips, and I'm fine with getting them as a side, but not if I'm being charged $16 for the meal. It just seemed lazy.   The service was ok I guess, but there were about 4 people who came by our table so it was never really clear who our server was and it lead to long wait times at every stage of the meal.   Overall, it was disappointing. If I'm paying medium to high prices for drinks and a meal for two it'd be nice to have an experience that isn't firmly mediocre. The whole thing just reeked of missed opportunity.   The place looks great, the location is fantastic, but everything else is kinda sloppy, sorta lazy, and poorly executed. Since I live in the neighborhood I'll probably be back but it'll be for the setting, nothing else."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My minds been changed, Jessica herself came out from the kitchen to serve our meal! I love it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The first floor of the restaurant was so confusing I had a flashback to labyrinth and was expecting David Bowie to welcome us to the hell we were about to experience. After waiting 20 minutes with a grumpy bartender and over priced drinks, we were awkwardly ushered to the EMPTY patio  (which is beautiful). To our surprise the menu offered less choice than real women on Ashley Madison. We were expecting a gourmet burger for the price, but were served mediocrity on a plate with a side of old dutch chips. The old dutch chips were our only option for sides - for $18 you could have offered Miss Vicks with an option of salt & vinegar or jalape√±o. Now that would have been something!"}
{"text":"After coming to this restaurant and having a rather disappointing meal, I posted my review about my lackluster experience.  Almost immediately the owner of the restaurant had replied to my review on here and vowed to \"make things right.\"  I had contacted the owner as requested but was ignored and have not heard back from them.  Mediocre food, disorganized service and poor customer service made me change my review to 1 star."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great location. My first experience at Charbar was awesome!! They had a very friendly atmosphere with great service."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner and it was amazing.  The dry aged porterhouse was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It fed 3 of us."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife for her birthday dinner on New Year's Eve. We had a great time the service was amazing and the food was excellent"}
{"text":"Met friends here for an early supper. They sat us at a table that was SO cold. Air conditioning was pouring out at our feet and cold air was coming down on us from above. It was a beautiful summer day outside, so this was not great as we were all dressed for warm weather and froze our butts off. When we asked about it, the waitress offered us blankets to keep warm, which seemed odd and I didn't want to try and eat with a blanket on my lap so I declined. There were lots of other tables available when we arrived, so I'm not sure why they didn't just move us (?)   The atmosphere is OK. It seemed a bit dark coming in from outside and I wish we'd been given the option to enjoy our meal outside where it was warmer. I imagine in cooler months it might feel cozier.  4 of the 6 guests wanted pizza, but they only had enough dough to make 2 (this was at 5:30 pm), so 2 people were disappointed from the get go. They could have shared, but they decided to order other mains instead. The pizzas looked good, they didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. Our other friends had bread, salad and roasted chicken, which looked pretty amazing. They said the chicken was delicious, but the bread was just ok.  My husband and I shared a steak. I was expecting great things, but honestly it seemed under-seasoned, a little overcooked, and you had to pay extra for any sides, even though the meal was $$$. We chose to have the fries, and they were the best part of the meal for me. We buy grass-fed steak when we cook it at home, and I think my husband and Bon Ton Meats makes a better meal.   We thought we might have dessert, but at $10 a serving - and nothing that seemed that \"special\" we passed and got ice-creams at the food truck vendor on the street outside after our meal.  I've heard lots of people say they think this resto is overpriced and doesn't deliver value, and I'd have to agree. The location is fantastic, and super convenient for me after work, so that's disappointing, but I would not recommend it.  Food *** Ambience *** Service *** Summary - A disappointment considering what it could be, definitely not living up to its full potential."}
{"text":"We had a great time there. The atmosphere is great, staff are friendly and interior design is very trendy. Make sure to try the special (ceviche). We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch with my girlfriends after doing a 5k Colourful Charity run. Charbar Hostesses were more then happy to seat us. It was our lucky day we got seated at a table on the main floor patio facing the river! Prime people watching spot! Warm breeze, sunny day!  Our waiter Roger was great! Friendly, personable and attentive. Knew the menu well and when he didn't have the answer he found out! So yeah the soft serve ice cream is made in house!  With hungry tummies after our event filled morning we ordered the hamburger which I've been advised may be one of the best Calgary has to offer! Out comes a burger with two patties , yep 8 oz of pure unadulterated protein! A grilled homemade bun, avocado , bacon...oh just an incredible burger when you are having a 'man sized appetite kinda day'. Not to mention the fries, crispy, salty goodness, cooked in beef fat.   Dessert, how can you pass up a Sundae? In house ice cream, dipped chocolate, caramel and almonds with a cone stuck on top! Share this bowl as its HUGE! Charcut team has done it again. The atmosphere is vibrant and exciting. There's a positive vibe with the bakery and coffee shop. I'm just waiting to get on the rooftop patio. When I do, I'll post again :)   Don't walk to Charbar RUN!   PS check out their cocktails, so inventive and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs no matter what you may have heard........Alright. I've read most of the posted reviews on Charbar. Am i missing something? We met a friend there for dinner, who i might add had eaten there a few days earlier and had the same experience as we did that night. I don't know where to begin. The service, plate presentation, portions? All of the above. Must say the avocado salad starter was good. That was the end of it right there. A tasteless butcher steak,except for the chimichurri sauce, of which there were 8 thin slices and tough ones at that. A sturgeon plate that was bland and tasteless as wwll with a colour and presentation  of an over cooked Denny's omelet. Desert consisted of an upside down ice cream cone dropped into a bowl with a microwaved clumpy chocolate sauce as a side. All in all a bad experience. This restaurant is trying to get by solely on its  exorbitantly over priced menu items ($39.00 for steak slices and $ 12.00 for a veg side) to make up for its poor quality, bad sense of cuisine and taste. Pretentious and condescending. Save yourself a bundle of cash and go to the Keg. Seriously, no I'm not kidding. The Keg. Better steaks, service and price. Oh ya and you wont have to stare at an elevator running or have it in your peripheral vision running up and down all night in the center of the dining room as a distraction. On second thought may be a plus. Takes your attention away from  the pending gouge at the end of your meal. I don't mind paying $$$$ for a quality dinner in a good restaurant. But I so hate the herd like mentality in dinning out that is believing some where is wonderful, exotic and great tasting just because its new in a great location and in vogue."}
{"text":"3rd time here and the restaurant staff is still obnoxious and the food is over priced and not very good.  We came in at 9:15 pm and were told we would have to wait as they were not sure if they had a table even though the place was half empty.   The Panqueque dessert was cold and they were out of stock on a few dishes.  Never coming back her again."}
{"text":"We came here on a double date and had the aged porter house. It was some of the best neat I've ever had! We al thoroughly enjoyed it! The aides were amazing too, we had beats and another veg.   The service was also amazing. Our server was attentive and funny and made some great suggestions.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been angry all day thinking about my meal last night.   Porterhouse steak says \"for two - $49\" on the menu. It turns out they charge $49 per person for it. Now I'm wishing I had complained - because the meat was so tough and old tasting I'm furious I wasted $100 when we didn't even eat it.   Wine was unpleasant - $75/bottle. Music was so loud I had to shout into my date's ears to be heard. Dessert was $10 for a bowl of cheap ice cream with a cheap supermarket cone artistically turned upside down in it. The server told us not to bother with the peach dessert - it's just canned peaches.   Tripe chips are tasteless. Cooked eggplant was tasteless. Something came with a dipping sauce that was crunchy and unchewable. Not one item we ordered was edible.   $350 for two people. F*** this place."}
{"text":"First time at Charbar with a group of friends - not impressed enough with food to pay such expensive prices!!  So many other delicious and well-priced restaurants in Calgary to feel the need to return to Charbar anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"Atrocious experience. Seated promptly for 9 pm reservation. Service was prompt to take our drink and appetizer order. Drinks came quickly and were excellent. That was the high point. Waited an hour and 15 minutes for apps. Server brought our wine order but food never arrived. Limited communication from server. Cancelled balance of order due to wait time. Manager comped entire order, but too little too late. The kitchen here is terrible and unprofessional. Decent service, nice space. Far too large for capacity and scale of kitchen. Not recommended.  Went to Pigeonhole for late night small plates. Happy with that choice.  Charbar will be out of business in 3 months."}
{"text":"If I was blindfolded I might've guessed I was at Denny's. The patio views are amazing but as soon as you look down it all falls apart.   poor service (I think the server was hired off the sidewalk that night), Ordered three drinks from the menu before I finally picked one they had in stock (a beer. I just wanted a beer). The burger patty was flat and boring but it had some kind of tasty sauce (see, I'm trying to be positive), comes with a side of chips... chips... $18 for $0.53 worth of bagged potato chips. If this place put even slightly more effort into their patio I would LITERALLY spend my life up there. This was the biggest disappointment of 2015's new restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 8. Placed seemed pretty busy so good thing we booked ahead of time. Note though that they will require a credit card for bookings of 8 or more and at least 48 hrs notice to cancel without penalty.   Dishes that the group enjoyed: pistachio avocado bruschetta, eggplant and quinoa milanese chips, avocado mint salad, porterhouse  Things that weren't so great: margherita pizza (so bland), asador platter (blood sausage tasted alright but it was visually unappealing so most of us didn't touch it, other meats were meh)  Overall, food was good but price for the portion size was too much. I mean, $14 for maybe a cup/cup and half of steamed beats with a dash of blue cheese? Delicious, yes but too expensive. Also, the meats really needed the chimichurris as some were a little dry and not that seasoned so to charge your customers $2 for an ounce of sauce, it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth to be so nickel and dimed when the dishes are already on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Epic and the service was fun and engaging. Porterhouse for 2 was amazing. Great wine list too. Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal. A good Canadian cider too."}
{"text":"The day had come where I could finally sit out and enjoy Charbar's patio!   Who wouldn't love a day sitting in the sun, enjoying some eats and dope beats?  (Well, some fuddy duddies didn't like Ludacris blasting on the speakers and asked to turn down the music because it was \"too loud\" *eye roll*)  Nevertheless, we had a great lunch and I found a new fave place for guac! I have no idea what seasoning they had on their chips but it made them super addicting, we couldn't get enough!  Our pizza and burger were ok, nothing spectacular. So if you're looking to go for appies (GET THE GUAC) and drinks this summer, hit up Charbar's patio!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food, very good wine as well, chef is a very nice girl. Will certainly go again."}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed in our dinner experience tonight. I've been to Charcut before and loved it there so this was a huge letdown. The food was not up to the calibre you'd expect from their price point and the service was pretty awful. While our waitress was really nice and had very good intentions, it was clear there were major training deficiencies as she didn't know the ingredients in the dishes or how they were prepared. The menu was also very misleading - we ordered the porterhouse steak where the menu says \"Porterhouse steak for two\" but the price was per person ($49 each totaling $98 for the item). When we brought this up at the end of the meal with the waitress she looked confused and didn't even realize that the price was per person. After she went to check she then brought over a manager who brought a menu and pointed out exactly how we were wrong. At least two other restaurants in the city that I know of offer a similar item (ie. porterhouse/tomahawk steak for two) and the price is listed for the ENTIRE item as opposed to half (Mercato and Chicago Chophouse). We were not offered anything for the misunderstanding and paid full price.   While the quality of the meat itself was really good, the rest of the dishes were just ok (tripe chips were bland and oyster had pieces of shells in them) and the terrible customer service really soured the experience so we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"As far as rooftop patios for sunsets and river views, this place is hard to beat. Combine that with great service and a well rounded drinks menu and it's the recipe for a pretty fun evening.  To get to the rooftop we were greeted on the bottom floor, who asked if we'd been up before and explained to take the lift up to level 3, where we would be greeted by another hostess. They also took the time to explain that there was a smaller menu available on the patio.  Taking the lift up to level three, we were greeted within 60 seconds by a hostess, who offered us a choice of tables, including a riverside one in the sunshine where people were just leaving. No guesses for which one we chose! She wiped down the table for us and handed us some menus.  We opted for cocktails the first round (I was torn and went with the server's suggestion of a C, G & T - a refreshing take on a usual gin and tonic, with particularly tasty tonic water that they give you the bottle for separately). I also stole a few sips of the New York Sazerac which I was tempted to get for myself for round two.  There's not a lot of food options for the patio, a couple of smaller plates / starters and three items from the fire pit. We tried the salt brick chicken and the gaucho burger. The salt brick chicken came out served as a burger which was a bit of a surprise based on the description, but it was super tasty. I much preferred this to the gaucho burger, which lacked any real flavour or juicy burger goodness.  For drinks round two we tried their red sangria - served in a 1L pitcher ($40) rather than having two 13 oz glasses ($14). The sangria was a sweeter wine with chunks of grapefruit, lemon and lime, and went down pretty easily.  Overall, a great option for sunset and river views, with heaters to keep you warm on chilly nights. Come for the views, drinks and service - if you're a big foodie I'd probably dine downstairs and come up for drinks beforehand (and afterwards)."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal last night, with our foodie friends, everyone for the most part, came away very happy and satisfied.  The only compliant was the lack of beverage knowledge and ingredients for speciality coffees.  But other then that service was great, company was excellent, food and presentation was fantastic.  My one friend did make a comment on the 98 dollar porterhouse us 3 men shared, that for that kind of price \"he's had the meat trimmed better with no fats or gristle\". I believe it was 32 Oz. But 5 to 7 Oz's of fat and bone. And for the length of time they profess to hang their meat, it should have been more tender. We really enjoyed the room and atmosphere, very vibrant and continuously moving. But not intrusive.  Overall a great small group dining experience(3 couples). Definitely will be coming back to try some other, what appeared to be, wonderful dishes.  This east village, along the Bow and pathway, is a fantastic hidden gem, in my mind."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding birthday lunch with my niece at the recently renovated Simmons building in the East Village. The restaurant was lively and upbeat. Julia, our server was knowledgeable about the menu, the ingredients and where they originated, and the preparation of the dishes.   She offered some great suggestions and had a great of timeliness: she was there when we needed her but did not hover.  The food was exceptional! We shared a pistachio and avocado bruschetta that came with sourdough bread from Sidewalk Citizen Bakery, a half side of bagna cauda (vine tomatoes with tuna conserva and olive oil - perfect for dipping up with that sourdough) and  then the choripan sausage on a bun. The flavour of all the dishes was exquisite and to be savoured! Finished up with a cup of rich, fresh roasted coffee from Phil and Sebastian's. The only down side: we didn't save room for dessert."}
{"text":"We were seated in the bar area and ordered Charbar's 2015 YYC Pizza Week dish, Truffled Pighead Mortadella, Sausage skillet chorizo, and beef short riblets. As for drinks, I had the Foundry Golden Cider beer. To me, it's a great drink to cleanse the palette and gives a nice refreshing finish after a chow.  This is one of my favorite pizza flavors as it has a strong taste of the meat (not overpowering) and well seasoned which reminds me the taste I had in the Philippines. The added pistachios gave a new layer of flavor and texture to this bad boy.  I highly recommend the ribs if you are seriously hungry or a meat lover. The meat flavor of the meat was bold, the wood fire definitely helped bring out the natural flavor of this morsel and the fat that came with it is worth the bite.   I honestly never expected the blood sausage after it was served. Afterward, I looked it up what morcilla was and there it was. I've never tried blood sausage, but it has a unique taste to it and I actually liked it. It was soft, rich, creamy, and all of the ingredients in it really outdone themselves.   Overall experience was worth the walk from City Hall train station, and I highly recommend this place whether it would be brunch or dinner. There will always be a dish for anyone to enjoy. Be warned, the service at Charbar can be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"This review applies specifically to the rooftop patio. This is a place you go for after dinner drinks as the scenery from the river is ideal. Great atmosphere on late summer nights.   The menu is over priced for quality, quantity and limited menu options. $19 for very thin crust pizza that resembled a pita pizza I could make at home. Appetizers cost $13-15 for what I consider small portions for items like chips and guacamole. When I enjoy an afternoon on a patio with friends we typically have a group of 4 or more, each appetizer is set to mildly satisfy two not particularly hungry diners."}
{"text":"I experienced the roof top patio for the first time today! What can I say? It is a beautiful, relaxing, sunny nook just offside to Calgary busy downtown. I enjoyed my time up there and the staff was very friendly. I sat at the bar and had some good laugh with the bartender. I came downstairs to enjoy some brunch has the menu on the roof top patio is pretty limited and I was not in the mood for a burger and such. I hear however that the burger is to die for. I guess I'll have to try it at some point. All in all it was a great experience it's just a shame they don't have any breakfast items on the roof top patio. Couple eggs  bacon and toast would have satisfied my craving for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you love meat.....  We had drinks on the rooftop patio and then went downstairs for dinner.   It was our first time here so we order the sample meat platter.  It was terrific.  As a side we ordered fries and a broccoli salad which was insanely good.  I don't know what the Orange coloured dressing was in the broccoli but it was excellent.     During dinner, the manager came by to ask how things were and to make sure all was good.   Perhaps they are reading reviews and are actively working to fix them.   The service we got was good, and the staff were friendly and knowledgable.      I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"A really cool place to get a bite. Charbar gets creative, reasonable price, lunch-crowd pleasing lunches right (4-5 star).  But it simply repeats the formula for dinner at twice the price, and executes it less well in my experience (burnt, overcooked, poor flavours, pretentious portions). Little pride and quality control.   The Arctic char was the worst offender - a terrible dish of miniature proportions for $35+! The sausage dish: two normal-sized and tasty sausages for $20! Nothing to accompany them. $20! The pizza had completely charred-through meat.  The only hit: the sundae.  For 1/2 the price you'll eat twice as well at Earls.   Stick to lunch at Charbar - their forte."}
{"text":"Nice place, great atmosphere! Some of the food was excellent! I was there with a group of 6 so got to try a few things. The cocktails were exceptional, although a couple folks waited an excessive amount of time for theirs to not have them discounted or comped. All our appetizers were awesome, the dinner entrees and sides were good. The most disappointing part was having to trim the porterhouse. The taste of this dry aged steak was awesome but having to work to get there was disappointing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend sat next to Roger Mooking (Host of Man Fire Food on the Cooking Channel and Food Network) on a flight from Calgary to Toronto who had visited Charbar and highly recommended it to him. We went once and ordered the 32 oz dry aged porterhouse; oh my goodness was it life changing. We have now celebrated all our milestones both personally and professionally at Charbar ordering the porterhouse and on occasion, some other goodies. We always get our porterhouse 'Chicago style' (super charred) and cooked medium-medium rare. It's served with Maldon salt and we order a side of chimichuri (so good!).   The avocado and sourdough appetizer is delicious. My boyfriend did/does not like avocados but will only eat it at Charbar (thank you Charbar, I appreciate it!).   It's also fantastic that you can bring your own bottle (subject to a $25 corking fee) and so we often do so. Service has always been great and waiters are attentive and friendly. Any out of town guests are always brought to Charbar by us now and they all agree that it is a wonderful gem of a steakhouse in Calgary.   Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I Dined here for dinner on a Monday night with my gf for a special occasion. Everything exceeded expectations. The Porterhouse is there speciality and we knew we would be splitting this. The steak was a 60 day dry aged longhorn breed (not angus) and grassfed from a local alberta rancher. The taste was indescribably good and unique. For those not accustomed to grass fed cattle it may take some adjustments to your ideas about how steak should taste but once you go grass you don't go back. This steak would have been more than enough for both of us but we ordered much more.   The beef empanadas were baked to perfection and were bursting with flavour. BUT the biggest surprise came from the pizza! We ordered the Calamari pizza and it was a slam dunk. Not a typical pie but they use Sidewalk Citizen's (bakery next door) sourdough starter for the bread which is thick and crunchy on the outside but chewy and soft on the inside. Mix that with the meltiest and richest cheese smothered all over with thick pesto drizzled all over and you get one of the best pie's in town.   The restaurant is not cheap so don't be surprised to shell out some bucks for a meal here at dinner but it is well worth every penny. I will be back to try their brunch, more pizza, and special occasion meat indulgences."}
{"text":"Well I'd love to give this restaurant a great review because the atmosphere was lovely, and the drinks that my dear friend and I had while we reconnected after 20 years were more than decent! The waiter asked if we'd like still or sparking water ... She said still, I said sparkling. I had a beer: $6. She had a gin &  tonic: $7. The bottle of San Pellegrino that was left at our table (that one can get at London Drugs for $0.97: $9!!    NINE FRICKING DOLLARS?!?  I won't be returning there anytime soon ... If ever!!"}
{"text":"We had a great evening , food is excellent and staff are friendly.  Their Argentinian menu is unique in Calgary and their chef has spent lots of time there.  Be sure to get food and wine advice from the chef!  This is also a great place for company events and private functions!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my first visit to Charbar when it first opened and although I didn't have the best experience that time around, I must say that I've truly enjoyed my last three visits here! All of them have been for their brunch or lunch service. I've been able to try the deep fried french toast bites, bagna cauda, asado plate, jamon crudo pizza, and during Big Taste their feature breakfast burger.  Today I ordered one of the lunch features which was a pizza that featured roasted chicken and crispy chicken skin on top! Like what, who does that?! The crispy chicken skin is what sold me and I definitely thought it finished off the pizza so well. Their pizza dough by the way is bomb because it comes from Sidewalk Citizen =) Our server today was lovely (I wish I remembered his name, I am the worst at that!) He was very personable and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal. And just a small thing that I noticed was that more than one person (that didn't include our server) ensured that we always had water in our glass. I appreciate that attentiveness because it really shows that they work as a team.  P.S. their beef fat fries are amazeballs! They are the type of fries that you can't stop eating no matter how full you are.  Reserving my last star for when I am able to go back and try their dinner menu again, but if my last few visits indicate anything, I'm sure it won't be hard to give =)"}
{"text":"Ordered the 32 oz. Porterhouse aged 77 days 4.5/5 yelps Shared by the table and it was served sliced by the kitchen. It probably would have been served the same way if the steak was for one person. Ordered brussel sprouts, yams, fries as the sides. 4/5 yelps Cerviche was mixed at the table. 4/5 yelps Service 5/5 yelps Value 4/5 yelps It's a pricey meal, be prepared to pay for it.  The menu is not very extensive but you won't starve."}
{"text":"I can see the atmosphere being great on a busy night, the room is beautiful.  The service was good, recommendations solid, the food was average, more seasoning, I ordered the steak, please do not cut it, all of the juices will leak away as it rests, so you end up with a dry cut of pricy meat."}
{"text":"First time here -- worth the hype. We took a beautiful bike ride along the river to get here. Can't beat the location and very hip vibes of this place.   We were seated right away and then surprised with complimentary French toast bites! Had the burger and choripan for brunch, along with Phil & Sebastian's cappuccino and Americano. The food was creative, well prepared and very generous... We were impressed with the very quick and friendly service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The food is trendy and original. This renovated factory warehouse gives it a great modern look by the river. The prices are also very fair. And the staff is probably the best I have had. Tipping is a pleasure."}
{"text":"My first experience at Charbar's sister restaurant, Charcut; I was pounding Dark & Stormies while staring at a disembodied pig's head that was mounted in front of the window, and trying not to cry vegan tears.  Suffice it to say, that I was rather wary when my pal suggested we meet up here. More so, when I tried to find their menu online and could only find pictures of meat (this has since been remedied, and their menu is available on their website).  However, the awesome people at Charbar reached out to me via Twitter, and assured me that they would do their best to make sure I left fat and sassy. After being away from town for several weeks; I had gotten used to not only having friends that were willing to eat vegan food with me, but finding options that were great and not just entr√©es that had the meat removed, or sides with no sauce.   I made a reservation on Twitter, and my friends and I were seated at a cozy table that had a great view of the dining area and open kitchen. Charbar is situated inside the Simmons building, and shares space with Sidewalk Citizen Bakery and Phil & Sebastian. On a day when it isn't hailing or snowing; you can sit on their gorgeous patio, which has a great view of Downtown and St. Patrick's Island.  Our waiter was really friendly and knew not only the menu, but the history of the building. His extensive and loving descriptions of each item made even the selections I couldn't eat, sound delicious. Because of our previous Twitter exchange, Charbar already had some amazing things they were going to prepare for me, so I just said yes to all the things.   We started off with cocktails and wine. I had the Aerolineas: a bourbon based drink with lemon juice and earl grey syrup. It was delicately balanced and refreshing. If you check in on Yelp, you receive a free gift from the chef, which on this night; was a complimentary bowl of cancha (homemade corn nuts). They were addicting, and it was hard to stop eating them. Our appetizers came out fairly quickly. I got the pistachio and avocado bruschetta, with homemade potato chips - normally it comes with bread from Sidewalk Citizen. It was maddeningly decadent. I also got the vegetable ceviche, which had more corn nuts, cucumber curls and charred tomatoes. The chef brought these out personally, and introduced herself to us. It all made me feel ridiculously spoiled.  For dinner, they put together an entr√©e for me that isn't on the menu. It had quinoa, roasted almonds, beets and mint. It also came with two eggplants that had been roasted in coals and then soaked in sherry.  I don't remember what wine I had with this, but it was suggested by our waiter, and it was white and from Argentina. At first, I found the quinoa a little under seasoned, but after eating it with the eggplant; it tasted a lot better. My picky friend got an excellent cheese pizza and their beef fat French fries. My not-so-picky friend got roasted chicken that had been prepared on a Himalayan salt brick. My lady friend got their gaucho burger. My one nitpick, is that they forgot my friend's request for her burger to be sans bun; but they did apologize profusely and offer to make her a brand new one.  We were so stuffed after dinner, all we wanted was espresso (and possibly a nap). The espresso was reliably good, as they get it straight from P&S and the roaster is right in the building. It doesn't get much fresher than that. Charbar one upped themselves yet again, by giving us dessert anyway - and even having a vegan dessert. If it wasn't for the espresso, I would've happily curled up on the couch; used my jacket as a blanket & switched on the Netflix app on my phone.  Thanks for treating us so well, Charbar. Can't wait to come back and even out my farmer tan on your patio!"}
{"text":"Dozens of tables available and servers standing around doing nothing. But they want you to wait 1.5 hours.   Don't waste your time and effort the food can't be that good."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all.  Highly over-priced, low-quality food.  Service was very poor. The prices and the decor are most probably what make this place  seem 'up-scale'."}
{"text":"Last night had a chance to check this place out for the first time.  We decided to sample a few things between the four of us.  Very impressed with ambience, quality of food ,and overall experience given they just opened!  Our server genuinely tried to impress us and aimed to please. Started with a few of the appy's.  Eggplant chips were flavourful and crisp, but a bit disappointed by the portion size ~ next time will have to order two!  Next on the list was ceviche which was recommended. To be honest, we were disappointed.  Best for Charbar to stick with the char-meats instead of attempting to do it all.  Fish pieces needed to be cut smaller for sharing and it would have been nice to have crostini or tortilla to scoop up the ceviche.  The dry-aged porterhouse which was \"melt in your mouth\" amazing!  No need to order the dips!  Decadent on its own.  We also ordered all of the sides to try which were great; kale, beets and frites.  Will definitely go back again.  Plan to check out the HUGE rooftop with the amazing river and city views.  Without a doubt this place will do well.  Only other friendly suggestions for improvement:  we were sharing and there were not any serving utensils provided with any of the dishes.  Wondering why none of sidewalk citizen desserts on the menu?  No cappuccino or lattes after 9pm as Phil and Seb is closed?!will there be reserve wine list in future?"}
{"text":"Way below average service. For a $300 dining experience (and no booze because they did not have liquor license at the time), the wait staff was a joke. Nice people but very bad training is to blame. The staff knew next to nothing about the menu, set the plates down without explaining the dish and were mostly non-existent during the meal. The food was not bad but I would have expected way more. For the price point (expensive), charbar is nowhere near where it needs to be compared to similar Calgary restaurants. The ultra-dry aged porterhouse was a good cut of meat but watch out for the 'got you' on the price (it's a per person price not the whole steak... So times it by two). The print on the menu is about font size of 6 so bring your reading glasses to catch this ridiculous way of doing business. When we brought this up with the staff the manager came and had to explain it to us like we were school kids getting lectured for not reading a test correctly... Way to go on the customer service front.  I'm not sure I understand the concept of Argentinean steak house as I've been to steak houses in Argentina and their version of the concept is about as far away as Canada is to Argentina... I think there were two steaks on the menu.   I may try charbar again but I will give them a while before thinking of going back.  Also, reading the other reviews (at the time of writing this review) it seems to me like some insiders have written these... Attending pre-parties, naming the owners / chefs in the reviews and reviews where people have obviously not attended the restaurant. Hopefully yelp will take these down. Way to game the system... Maybe you should focus on really good food and great service... Usually gets you places."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all. Menu was not good. There was a 96 dollar steak that didn't even come with a side next to some pathetic pizza options. We decided on only appies. We had some cooked cheese which was some burnt disgusting mess and a cheviche which was some tiny pieces of seafood swimming in oil and lemon, gross!! I would never go back !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times recently both before taking an espresso/latte art course at Phil & Sebastians. Both times we were served by Von and both times were absolutely AMAZING! The building is a restored Mattress Factory and has lots of rustic charm. In the summer, it has one of the nicest outdoor patios with a view of the river and East Village pathways.    Noted on the menu, it states that Charbars' Chef Pelland is an avid fisher, hunter and specializes in whole animal butchery, curing, grilling, roasting and working magic! She sounds like quite a woman!!'  Start off with s cocktail. If you don't see something  on the menu that interests you, they have talented mixologists ready to attend to your needs.   Next the fresh oysters...they come with a delicious Argentinian Chimichurri Mignonette.   The \"Small plates\" or appetizers are all made with fresh ingredients and prepared with love & attention to detail. We especially love the Charred Napa Cabbage Salad, Chorizo Sausage, and Crispy Calamari our first visit. The second time, we had the 3-course Chefs Tasting Special. It started with a thinly sliced smoked salmon with cr√®me fraiche, dill weed, and capers on a crispy cr√™pe. Seriously was AMAZING followed by a Slow roasted braised beef served on polenta. Not just any polenta, but the best polenta I've had in my life! Go to Charbar, drink, feast, walk down the river or take a course at Phil & Sebastians. Just do it!"}
{"text":"I have always had inconsistent meals here which has been frustrating because the venue is great, the location is fun and a lot of friends choose this spot. I have had amazing oysters, as well as the most off oysters I have ever tasted. I have had delightful empanadas, and I have had them come completely burned. Same thing happened with the pistachio avocado toast, flatbread and steak. The charred Napa cabbage salad seems to be consistent ... so I would recommend that it is delish.   Some of my colleges who are really into wine think the list is terrible. When I have events here I usually bring my own bottles in for this reason.     I found that  the event space upstairs has become dirty. I either planned or attended events months apart and some of the same smudges were still on the glass upstairs. I helped out a friend who planned an event there who brought her own Windex and magic erasers to clean up. That is nuts for the price point. I am sure if you came for a wedding your dress would be black from all the black drag marks on the once pristine wooden flooring."}
{"text":"Great place. We had the burger, the chicken salad and the pistachio bruschetta. Everything was well executed and tasty. Nothing bad to say today!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was absolutely fantastic. However, a huge blindside was when our bill was more than  $40 than what we expected. We ordered the steak for two, listed as $50 for 2lbs. Apparently it was meat per lb which was not listed on the menu. The waitress agreed that the wording wasn't quite clear and the team had gone back and forth between wording. It wasn't clear. We were pretty upset but we weren't about to argue or cause a scene, needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I can't really rate the food because I went here for a rehearsal dinner and we only had bite size appetizers. Although, I must say they were extremely delicious (even the devilled egg and normally I avoid eggs). We then had tiny tacos, crispy zucchini and sliders which were also to die for. The building was amazing and the space we had on the 2nd floor was decorated beautifully. The service was very professional and got through the crowd efficiently. I would really like to return to this place one day to try out some of the amazing looking things on the menu and enjoy the top deck view."}
{"text":"Like most people who have visited Charbar I was really impressed by the room. Beautifully decorated,  definitely one of the more esthetically pleasing restaurants in the city. The view from the patio is also gorgeous.   As with most new restaurants it needs to iron out a few wrinkles. There's a sign near the entrance that  says the main floor hostess will help seat you for the patio so we checked in with them. After about a five minute wait (a headscratcher because there were plenty of vacant and unreserved tables) we were taken upstairs Interestingly enough there's another hostess at the top of the stairs who seemed to be seating people who just walked right in.   The patio menu is great if you're there just for a drink but very limited if you're hungry, offering only a few dishes from their main menu. Perplexing, as we could've had dinner there but felt compelled to leave in search of more options for food. We did order an appy (tripe chips) just to be able to say we are there. While tasty, it was a little high on the salty side. The accompanying sauce was quite overpowering and probably unnecessary.   We also ordered some cocktails, one of which came with the kind of ice you see in McDonald's soft drinks (not a huge concern in the big picture but definitely not acceptable if you're a cocktail snob!).   I'll come back in a few months to try the menu properly and to see if time and experience helps smooth things out."}
{"text":"I really thought this review would be two thumbs up but I think Charbar was more interested in opening before Stampede than making sure they were actually ready to open their doors. From the moment of walking in, the restaurant felt like chaos. Drinks not being available, only a partial menu available on the rooftop patio, each floor not knowing what the other 2 floors are doing. I had such huge expectations only to be completely deflated with substandard cuisine and to add insult to injury paying $100 for a steak I thought was $50. Apparently it's per pound if you share with your spouse. Extremely disappointed with the food quality and presentation."}
{"text":"Having the best roof top patio in town is a good start. menu is creative and the food is delicious. Service is impeccable. Definitely a great place to enjoy a summer's evening."}
{"text":"Extremely pricey! Calamari was mediocre, steak was lacking seasoning, burger and sausage were average, and $12 for 4 half slices of bread? Cocktails we around $15! Service was great and decor is beautiful but spend half the money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service as always. We were here for big taste Calgary brunch. My parents had their sandwich special which was a pork patty topped with a fried egg and pickles on a fresh baked bun. Being picky eaters they both enjoyed it.  I had baked baguette topped with avocado and two eggs. It was good too. I thought a little pricey but the quality was good so it helped to offset the cost reasoning a bit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and even better view on the rooftop.  Make sure to try the Riblettes!!"}
{"text":"This was recommended by a friend and it doesn't disappoint. The ambiance is modern and casual. It's pretty pricey but the quality of food makes up for it. We went there Saturday night for dinner and it's pretty busy,  so calling for reservation is recommended.  The restaurant is very rustic but it it was an old factory. They were trying to keep the original decor, I guess.  There were 3 other establishments that are located in the same building. A bakery, a coffee shop,  and a casual pub- if I'm not mistaken. Charbar was the busiest.  Their menu is simple- I mean not a lot of choices which prob add to the good quality of food that they have. We ordered their 30oz steak and roasted veggies.  The steak was pretty pricey but superb! The 2 kinds of sauces we ordered excellently goes with the steak.  Pairing it with red wine completed it! It was enough for the 4 of us. The salad was a good balance as well. We'll definitely come back here again. I'll reserve it for special occasion though 'cause its pricey as I said. The downside of this place though is, the location of the washroom. It's pretty creepy down there and this might be irrelevant but 1 friend of mine saw a ghost down there. It  was an old man smoking pipe and he's the one in the picture on their menu! Creepy! I won't be using their bathroom alone that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been following CharBar's instagram for months, getting tiny glimpses of what they've been putting together: a Argentinian style bbq joint with touches of what made Charcut an ongoing success.  Yet despite the disappointed reactions on Yelp (and maybe other food review sites) I was (and maybe am) largely optimistic that Charbar will work out it's \"kinks\"  But in my latest visit, I can't help but sum up my experience as underwhelming.  I supposed I'll start with the good. They offered brunch and it was easy for usto get reservations for four during lunch time. Their service was great and made sure my cup was filled with coffee. The decor of the place matched the rustic charm of the east village building it was located in.  THe food? well this is where things swing from polarizing ends of good and \"this could have been done better.\" Again the good: The eats are legit. My asado brunch plate provided ample proteins: eggs, ribs, and hollandaise (HECK YEAH THATS PROTEIN). The ribs are nothing to complain about and a worthy introductory dish to Argentinian bbq (I can't wait to try more) but I wish there was more chimmichurri sauce thrown on it (but I'm sure they could easily slather on the stuff upon my next visit). But the dish lacked in carbs or a side dish so I ordered the beef fat fries. Like Charcut's truffle fries, this side dish deserves street cred. They were crispy, beefy, and every bite curbstomped my tastebuds with flavour.  Now, onto the dark side of my review. First of the price was nothing to be pleased about. I paid dinner service prices for a brunch experience, I can't imagine what dinner costs would be like (since we didn't have access to the full menu and it isn't available online). But given the expected economic downturn, could Charbar have made changes so that they can offer an accommodating price while serving quality food? I mean the dessert was pretty disappointing: peaches and ice cream that to me, felt like I went to dairy queen and opened a can of delmonte fruits on a sundae, sadly as a bourbon  enthusiast I tasted no Bourbon. Personally Im never impressed with soft-serve, I know momofuku milk bar did it and I thought it was a bit lazy. Honestly if charbar offered Phil and Sebas and offered pastry from the nearby bakery, why couldn't they offer village ice cream? Maybe that's a deal that's yet to happen.  Also did the le creuset dinnerware also affect the pricing? Also not sure.  Again I'm optimistic. For a while Brazilian BBQ has impressed Calgary eaters like myself and I've long anticipated the arrival of Argentinian BBQ after watching Chef's Table (re: Episode three Francis Mallman) and  that charming Argentenian girl on Jamie Oliver's FoodTube channel. So after a few months or a year I'm eager to try CharBar again, hoping to flip my three stars into a five"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been guilty of knocking Calgary's food scene before. NO MORE! Charbar is freaking awesome. I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!  1. Drinks are delicious and well priced. I had the Corpse Reviver Cocktail 2.75 oz booze ($13) and the most delicious glass of wine ($15).  The wine was worth every penny (or nickel, as pennies don't count anymore). The cocktail had REAL booze in it. As in strong and delicious. NOT WATERED DOWN! And it didn't even taste like alcohol, but my face glowed like it was the first sip of alcohol I've ever consumed.   2. The food was delicious and what we ate - very well-priced. We ate an assortment of appies, sides and a clam pizza. You cannot make this type of food with these ingredients for less at home. I am so value conscious and I thought the prices were awesome. It's the type of food that is so delicious and different and you cannot stop eating even though you can feel your buttons popping.  3. Service. Stephanie was awesome and so patient and so knowledgeable with her recommendations. The place is gorgeous and a destination to head to for dinner. From what I could see, the restaurant is well-staffed.   In conclusion, I cannot wait to drop by again for dinner/brunch. Thank you Charbar people for opening up this gem. You make me proud to live in Calgary. I want to show you off to all my out of town friends who think they live in the centre of the universe.   The end."}
{"text":"Heads up! This is going to be one of those reviews where I try tell you about everything because it would be a shame to miss anything. If I can even come close to making it seem like I'm going way overboard on the detail - good. But I assure you I won't even come close to the amount of care and detail that they have poured into this restaurant.  +How to go to Charbar: As I see it, there's two ways to have the best Charbar experience that anyone could have. I think it's important to commit to one or the other and not try to mix the two so you don't cheat yourself out of something special.  1. The All In -   Make a special evening of it and plan to spend your whole time here. It took quite a long time for each dish to make its way to our table, but as we weren't in a hurry, it was very easy to roll with it and enjoy our time here. Fall in love with, and learn everything you can about the food, the staff, the building and the Charbar concept. By now, you've probably learned that it's in the Simmons Mattress heritage building in the East Village - that it's a one of a kind shared space between other local business icons Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery. You'll probably also have learned how this symbiotic building sharing lets Charbar serve up bread and coffee directly from the source. But this is just the tip of the ice berg!   If the building interests you, make sure you ask for a tour. They've got a wealth of stories all the way from the history of the space, to the challenges involved in cleaning out a century old mattress feather chute, to installing a brand new elevator in a building with hundred year old wood floors.   If the food interests you (and it will,) make sure to learn about Chef Jessica's time spent in Argentina and how it has influenced the Charbar menu. Learn about the traditional Argentinian fire ovens and seem them in action. The coolest part? None of this is insider info I'm passing your way. Chef Jessica is actively bouncing from table to table, introducing dishes and telling you about her downright artistic visions. We felt like total rockstars and at the same time were trying our best not to fanboy/girl right out at having such a rockstar chef come to our table.  Also hopping from table to table making everyone feel welcome, was one of Charbar's owners, Connie - She's so lovely! As \"The Yelp Guy,\" I had met Connie before, so in an attempt to keep my review as honest as possible, I tried to sneak past her, but it didn't work. When she spotted me, I made her promise that our table wouldn't receive any special treatment and I honestly don't think we did... But what I hadn't counted on is that it is very clearly everyone at Charbar's goal to make every single person's experience the most special. Did we receive special treatment? Oh heck yeah - but not above and beyond what any of the other tables could have expected, only above and beyond what anyone could expect from other restaurants. Connie's passion for everything that goes on within Charbar's walls is completely contagious. There's a story behind everything at Charbar, much of which is still ongoing. (As a result they've kept lots of space open on their \"inspiration wall\" to continue the story as it evolves, but that's enough from me, go learn from her.) Charbar is the collective result of many many years experience and loving dedication to the restaurant world and she's happy to share it with you and wants you to have the best time at her restaurant in a way that is completely honest and authentic. What's also really incredible is how this enthusiasm seems to get past along to all the Charbar staff (at least the ones I talked to). Our server (David) really seemed to love being involved with such a great restaurant and some excellent suggestions.  After dinner, maybe, maybe if you're up to it, you'll be able to talk yourself and your dinner guests into a fat saunter down the river walk, but hopefully you'll be so full of tasty goodness that you won't know what to do with yourself. Uncomfortable yes, but you'll know you'll have done it right.  2. The Drinkin', Light Bitin', Raw Bar Experience  I haven't done this yet, but you can bet that I will. The cocktails we had during our dinner experience were excellent and I'd love to hit up an after work session here for a few of these and to dive into their raw bar. By now, you may have heard about their incredible rood top patio, overlooking the bow river. It's pretty easy to say this would be an excellent spot to grab a few drinks in the sunshine, or even in the evening as the river path is lit so colourfully, and enjoy some light bites. You should note that they have a different menu for the patio. Instead of running food upstairs, they have another open concept kitchen complete with a smaller version of the Argentinian grill. This would make for some high quality foodie compliments to your patio session, but for the full dinner experience, sit inside. Rev limit"}
{"text":"If you visit Calgary, you must make a point to go to Charbar. The building itself is historic, formally an industrial building, and its juxtaposition to all of the newly constructed skyscrapers make it stand out. It's an overall beautiful, and beautifully decorated, restaurant. My husband and I sat down for an after-dinner drink at the bar and were pleasantly surprised by the wide wine, beer and cocktail selection. We also ended up ordering the yucca fries, which were to die for. Our bartender Andrew was clearly well-versed in all of the selection and made great conversation! We also had the opportunity to meet the restaurant manager, Tyson, who was more than willing to let us know more about the building's history, what they have to offer and very knowledgeable about food/drink. Everything from atmosphere to customer service to menu offerings are 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the meat was done to perfection. Make sure to try one of their cocktails as well"}
{"text":"Charbar was our gracious sponsor at the last Yelp event I attended and provided a great selection of the fresh seafood, steak and other delights that are served on a daily basis. It is exciting to see East Village finally coming alive as claiming a status of a place to go to where you can enjoy nature along the river and dine at some of the finest eateries in Calgary. It is projected that when all the projects are done, East Village will have a population of over 11,000 residents.  Calgary is known as Cowtown and the beef at charbar was some of the best beef I've had in a long time. charbar has a special refrigerator just behind the reception desk as you enter where they age cuts of beef. The temperature and humidity are strictly monitored and controlled and each cut of beef carefully displays the date it entered the fridge.  The beef served was cooked in a custom made wood-fire parrilla and served with 3 types of chimichurri: almond, herb and red. Parrillas are an essential part of Argentinian barbeques.  I liked the herb chimichurri the best, a good blend of flavours that just went well with the quality of beef that was served. The seafood was a selection of fresh oysters, giant prawns and snow crab legs, as fresh as the best seafood that I've tasted and I've tasted fresh from the fishing boats in Nova Scotia to a waiting pot of boiling sea water.  To start the evening off we were offered a taste of their tableside ceviche mixto. Fresh tuna, shrimp and spices, you can't go wrong selecting this as your starter. Based on what I tasted I'm definitely going back. Prices are fair for the quality of food served.  The Simmons Building is historic (103 years old) and they have preserved much of the original building. See if you can get someone to give you a tour. There's a boardroom you can rent out that still has one of the original feather chute which was used to drop the feathers to fill the mattresses that were made in the building. There are a couple of original safes that are now used as a pantry or storage areas for the restaurants inside. I was also told that the odd black square in the floor marked where firefighters would have to race into the burning building to hook up to a water supply in order to fight the fire.   Even on a Monday night charbar was a happening place not counting the Yelp invitees. There is a rooftop area that has its own kitchen and thus serves up a different menu from the main restaurant. Looking for a special place for that special event? I suggest you give charbar a call and check it out. The views from the rooftop are great and from what I tasted of the fare, the food will be good great too."}
{"text":"I was recently in Calgary on business for the week.  After a long day and a debrief with my team at the hotel bar, we all went our separate directions.  I like to walk and one evening I decided to explore the various blocks of the non-yet-complete East Village area.  At some point, I came across the old Simmons mattress building, noticed a coffee shop in front, and decided to move on.  At the back of the building, I noticed some sort of restaurant activity, and immediately circled back the front and came in.  Charbar is in the back and the place was packed.  I took a seat at the front bar and decided that beer and an appetizer would be the best option. Then I looked at the menu and was thrilled with the Argentinian selections. That brought back fond memories of Gayle and I in Buenos Aires and Baraloche, dining on steak, provoleta, empanadas, maybe a side order of asparagus, all washed down with a Malbec and Dulce de leche for dessert.   The first night I limited myself to some empanadas and provoleta (and switching to red wine), while the next night (at the bar again), I went for the gaucho burger and a smooth Portuguese red. It was all pretty darn tasty and just what I wanted to reminisce about our South American adventure.  This is a place that I would take Gayle, if I return, and when she agrees to come along."}
{"text":"Neat place.   The burgers were great although very big. Fries were very good.  Try them with the spicy aioli. Fried sour dough balls were yum. Good service."}
{"text":"We went to Charbar for lunch on Canada Day. First off, their lunch menu is pretty small. Not saying that's a bad thing, in fact, their burger was pretty good. Just the options were pretty limited. We ordered 2 burgers and the deconstructed empanada pizza special and lastly the snow crab sharing platter to share. Pizza was pretty doughy, burgers were good and snow crab salad was \"meh!\". Drinks were good, Spanish Estrella beer and their cranberry chamomile soda special. Overall the decor on the main level was pretty good, it was a pretty happening place with the bakery and Phil and Sebastians. We were seated on the second floor and there was a presentation happening on one side. It was pretty annoying that their speakers had a lot of feedback when they were switching between audio sources. Not anything specific to the food, but was just a minor annoyance. Other than that, the second floor is not super special, but I'd like to try the patio eventually. Rainy weather and clouds prevented us from doing so this time. Also, I imagine their dinner menu would be a little more elaborate. So my recommendation would be to have dinner on the patio if possible, also make a reservation if you can, they were turning people away for lunch."}
{"text":"Went when they were newly opened and they didn't have a liquor license. Service was slow but mainly due to the start up of their operations. Food was decent but a bit over priced. I'm eager to check out the roof top patio!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with Charbar. I went with the expectation that Charbar would be following in the footsteps of Charcut.. I was wrong.   Our server was very sweet but didn't know anything about the menu or wine list. My friend ordered his steak medium rare and it came out well done (it was $38 so he sent it back), when the second steak arrived it was blue rare. He was frustrated at this point and decided to just help the rest of us eat our meals. We ordered the eggplant which came out as a grey tasteless entire eggplant. We voiced our frustration with our server and the management came over to apologize. The manager offered us free dessert as an apology for our experience and we accepted one of each of the three choices. One dessert was a bowl of melted soft serve with some canned peaches, the second was also a bowl of melted soft serve with chocolate sauce, nuts and a sugar cone sticking out of it, and the third was a crepe (by far the best of the 3). Overall the experience wasn't great for the price point, the food was poorly executed and the service was sloppy. We did appreciate the efforts made by the management, but it didn't really do much to improve our dining experience. They certainly have big shoes to fill with Charcut having the reputation it has. I hope they are able to get it together soon."}
{"text":"When we arrived for our 6:00pm reservation, we were told we had to be out by 8:15. Then our server reminded us twice during dinner. Finally at 8:30, the manager asked us to vacate our table. We spend $340 on dinner for 4 people and we couldn't have the table for even 3 hours?! The two tables beside us were empty and there was no lineup at the door. But we were told a 16 top was coming in.  The food was good but not great. We found the steak a little chewy and all was very salty. We mentioned when we made the reservation that it was a birthday and again to our server. Nothing was done. We would not go back."}
{"text":"I love charcut, so I was super excited to try charbar. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.   I really like that they found such a cool way to use up the space in the building. The restaurant is very spacious with two floors. With that said, the area where they greet you is super awkward, lots of traffic and just confusing in general. While standing there, I had three different people try to assist me and then leave me half way through to assist other people who were equally as confused as I. Hopefully this gets better in time.   The menu on paper looked extremely appealing. We were all pretty excited to try the dishes.. And then pretty disappointed. The food first of all took quite a long time to come out. The place wasn't even packed, so I'd hate to wait for my food on a night the place was full. And second of all, the presentation was awful. I had the sturgeon ($36 by the way, for one individual portion) and it was plated with a sauce. It wasn't bad but definitely not worth $36 for anyone. We also had the short ribs with eggs and it literally looked like they just threw on the eggs and threw on three pieces of small ribs. So disappointing.   The parking in east village is a bit hectic as the place is still growing. There's a small parking lot next to the restaurant but most definitely not enough to accommodate for all the customers for the Simmons building. Lots of street parking and another paid parking lot further down from the building. I would advise going on Sunday or after 6 pm when parking is free.   I hope the restaurant is just in an awkward new phase and getting used to things and hope it gets a lot better. But it'll take a lot for anyone to convince me to go back here to eat."}
{"text":"I arrived at 11:15 to secure a table on the rooftop patio for sunny lunch. I was advised that the rooftop patio did not open until 11:30.  I approached the hostess at 11:30 to be seated and left after I was advised that I would not be seated until my guest arrived. Be sure to arrive all together to be seated ( On rooftop...second floor no prob...just rooftop...saving wear and tear on elevator I guess)  suggest that they look up Customer Service in dictionary."}
{"text":"Burger was unbelievable! Service was great, chef even sent out a free appy to our table.  I can't wait to go back and get the Alley Burger."}
{"text":"Utterly fantastic!  When I arrived I was instantly in awe of the space. Or should I say 'spaces'. The 3 level building has been masterfully renovated with out losing the historical charm. I won't even try to describe it. Just go see for yourself. And if you can, you must check out what is no doubt the best rooftop patio in the city!  The service was excellent. Knowledgeable, friendly and attentive.  As for the meal... We shared several dishes. I knew the steak would not disappoint. I love Charcut and I just had to have a steak! I did not expect to enjoy a vegetarian Civiche or beats but they were outstanding. The menu has such variety I found myself planning what I would order on my next visit.   My only regret was not leaving room for desert  ."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had an absolutely delicious warm chimichurri chicken sandwich on a charred tasty bun.  It was chewy, rich and a bit vinegary too.  I got a salad on the side and it was delicate and satisfying, with golden beets, feta crumbles, and red onions. The wine list looked interesting and varied, though I didn't partake.  I would come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Went there during a visit for patio drinks in the summer -no food. The drinks are a bit pricey but the view is very nice. What I found extremely unprofessional however, is that when the bill came ($32), I placed $40 on the table (2 $20 bills) waiting for the server to get it and bring me change. The server approached, clearly seeing the $40, and asked loudly \"Can I bring you some change?\". I answered \"yes thanks\". The server then asked the second question \"how much change would you like?\" - In what establishment is that considered proper, ever? How about you bring me all the change, then I can decide what to leave you? Please train your overly entitled serving staff.."}
{"text":"Love Charbar and their Argentinian pizza is just awesome so we naturally went to explore their creation in the last yyc pizza week which was what we voted as best thick crust and it was an upset that they didn't win this year imho.    Service is great but we did make a reservation,  I'm not sure what walking in would have been like.   We got a phone call the following day to check in on our experience (which I've never seen before) and it's obvious they were genuinely concerned at making the experience good for us (and everyone).   I'm not sure what happened in some of the reviews I've read,  but they are working over time to work on the bugs of a new venture (even though I haven't seen them personally)  A new item we tried this trip was french toast bites (part of the brunch menu) and they were so very delicious.   They were also a small portion so it was a treat but didn't feel like a crazy over indulgence either.     I still have yet to eat with a full dinner menu but that's on my list for the near future."}
{"text":"I like the concept of 3 businesses working together in one building, but charcut's menu and pricing needs some help.  I don't mind the price of the steaks as they are grass fed and Alberta raised, but they didn't come with any sides. No vegetables, no potatoes, it was literally sliced meat thrown onto a plate. The server said that they were presented like this because they were \"meant to be shared\", but I don't know who would want to share a 7oz steak with nothing on the side. This wasn't exactly clear to us while we were ordering and led to some confusion as some dishes (like the burger or chicken came with a side of fries).  Maybe it's because they just opened but they really need to either explain things more clearly on their menu or add some pictures to it or even have the servers explain what the dishes are.  Overall, though the taste of the food was good, I left unsatisfied with the meal as it was not what I was expecting. I will not be returning do to the high prices and small portions."}
{"text":"Great interior ,m! Probably the coolest architecture in town. Super hipster and trendy. Their food is above average we had a set dinner menu for larger group served family style  Their foods were juicy and interesting However the dessert was waaaay too sweet  Maybe it was my personal preference  But for a special night or cool hangout place ,,  River ! Rooftop! Vintage building with luxury furniture and open kitchen  YYC do not have any cooler place than here period"}
{"text":"Had a lovely drink at the downstairs bar at Charbar. Not to be confused with the rooftop bar, Charbar is actually on the main and second floor. The vibe is really cool, dark and moody. The bartender was very nice and helped with drink selection. My comrades had some lovely Manhattans and I had a One Night Stand which was fruity and delicious. When I checked in on Yelp we were sent over a plate of tempura eggplant which were tasty. I would definitely come back for a full meal but the vibe of the whole place is great to just chill and enjoy a classic cocktail."}
{"text":"I would love to write a review for Charbar but sadly when we got there the hostess let us know that the wait time was 1.5 hours. We asked if our party of 6 could put our name on the list and we were told no! They apparently don't have a list... Wtf?!? So we left."}
{"text":"Came down to see Calgary's new addition.Upon arriving the hostess where complete FREAKS! First we were stopped and cornered, asked if we have a reservation, second time, after we took a peek a very abrasive hostess came unto us at the bar and pretty much SCOLDED us rudely, face in our faces about not having a reservation, we almost got up and left at that point...luckily this place has a great open atmosphere with a ton of rustic industrial charm to win us over, not to mention our drinks were made with pure LOVE, our bartender ROCKED! We will try it again and hopefully the front have settled down:("}
{"text":"I've been curious for a while to try charbar, and tried this place for brunch- mostly because you can use that app to make a reservation before even getting out of your PJs. Saturday morning at 10:30 and it was relatively slow, so maybe reservations are not so needed. Good spot though, friendly service, great brunch foods (the bacon is double thick and double smoked, so you know, it's double good!) and no pressure to move along, we felt comfortable hanging out and sipping coffee after we finished eating. Generally, a nice spot!  I am so curious about the giant steaks in the cooler as you walk in, I must convince some friends to come back with me for dinner :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It is located in east village - which is such a great neighbourhood to visit in Calgary - and is right next to Phil and Sebastian coffee in the Simmons building. I went on a weekday for lunch and ordered off their weekday lunch menu. This menu is offered on weekdays from 1130 am to 5 pm. There was no wait time for us and they have patio seats available as well so we took that option as it was a great day outside. The servers were friendly and pointed me in the right direction in terms of food options.   I ordered the asado beef steak and fries which came with the option of soup of the day or market salad as a side ($26). The beef steak was cut into small pieces with pesto sauce on top. The steak was cooked to perfection - charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside. The pesto sauce went really well with the steak. The fries had a nice flavor to it and so did the salad - subtle lemon flavors which were enough for me to finish eating them both! This says a lot about how good it was because I usually have a hard time finishing all my side dishes!   My friend got the featured fugazza (Argentinian pizza) with the sides of daily soup and fries ($16). The size of the pizza was good for one person to finish for sure. It was a pesto prosciutto feature the day we went which was a really great combination. They definitely do not skimp out on the cheese which was great! The more cheese the better right?   The best part was that the price of this lunch includes dessert! We had the choice to choose between blueberry parfait and dark chocolate soft serve ice cream! I was super happy to end a great meal with a dark chocolate soft serve!   Also, their drink menu included some of Phil and Sebastian's coffee items as well which was fantastic! Overall, I had a great experience eating lunch here and I would highly recommend it! I am definitely going back to try some more of their daily featured items :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend yesterday on a beautiful, warm sunny evening for the patio. We were seated on the edge with prime views of the river and that pretty much won us over. We ordered the crushed avocado with plantain and tortilla chips which was a light and delicious appy, and shared one of the flatbread pizzas which cheese and yellow tomatoes on it - so simple but so good! Would love to come back after a nice bike on the river pathway."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to try out the Rooftop Bar @ Simmons but we unfortunately never got the chance. When we got to the Simmons building, we made our way to the patio. There appeared to be many open seats. The hostess asked us if we were looking for a table for two and we replied yes. She then asked us if we had received a text. I told her that we had not and she informed us that we needed to return to the main level and check in. We proceeded back to the main level and checked in with the people in the lobby. They asked me for my cell number and told me I would get a text when a table was ready. I asked how long the wait might be and she said it would likely be over an hour. I was a bit shocked about this as I had been on the patio and there appeared to be many available tables. Not wanting to wait for over an hour my wife and I got an Uber and went to Cannibale in Bridgeland (EXCELLENT SPOT BTW). About 10 min after we had left, I received a text telling me that the table was ready. Not sure if it was a lack of communication between the patio and the main level but it was not a great experience for us, and I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Round 2 at Charbar! Even though we were here during Big Taste, we opted to order from their regular menu. I've only been here for lunch once before so I was stoked to try dinner. Make that *ahem*¬†second dinner.  We sat upstairs, the place was packed even though our reservation wasn't till 8:30pm. Weekends are busy.  - Ultra dry-aged porterhouse steak ($96.00) - we decided to go all out and share the porterhouse steak. 32 oz is a pretty decent deal, especially when you share it between 5 people. We asked for it rare and it came out perfect. Worked out that everyone got about 4 slices each. My friends were in heaven; shouts of \"best steak ever\" and eyes were rolling back in beef ecstasy. Two buds loved it so much they made sure nothing was left; eaten bare to the bone. - Kale salad ($13.00) - now this kale I can get downnnnn with. The pickled chilies gave the salad a twist of heat while the gouda provide a light, cooling contrast. - Fried brussels sprouts ($12.00) - the brussel sprouts were excellent! Even the¬†brussel sprouts skeptics at the table loved it. The chopped almonds were nicely roasted. - Parilla beef fat fries ($8.00) - I've had these beef fat fries before and they're as good as the first time I had it. - Dulce de leche panqueques ($10.00) - these are Argentinian style sweet filled crepes.¬†So so good. Just get it.  Charbar continues to impress. Can't wait to come back in the summer for their rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great. Service was tentative but was longer than expected for a weekday lunch. I got the $25 lunch special, which was the featured 90-day aged Alberta butcher steak. It comes with fries and your choice of soup, salad or more fries (lol I know..). Included in the lunch special was some refreshing Dairylane ice cream that is prepared in a paper cup in case you are rushing to go back to work. This was such a good value. I can't wait to return to try their dinner."}
{"text":"Had the ceviche and bruschetta which were to die for  Hilary was the serve and she exceeded expectations by being personable and charming   Can't wait to return for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the view is fantastic on the patio.... but we had TERRIBLE service from Brad. If the patio was busy I could understand, but it wasn't, we tried to order food 3 times before he finally took the order. My drink order he took after i sat waiting for about 1/2 hour as my girlfriend had almost finished hers before he came back to ask what I wanted to drink. Our food sat under the warmer for a while before making it's way to us, my bread for the avocado bruschetta was SO HARD you could only eat the middle really. He never asked us how the food was or if we wanted a second drink... Generally he was slow and grumpy and abrasive, and we went to Charbar so excited as we had such a great time at the Yelp event we just had to go back..... Now we are perhaps going to try our hand in the restaurant (as the food is great) and not the patio as he had us turned off which is such a shame as its a beautiful space."}
{"text":"Cool place. Amazing coffee! I had the crab salad which was excellent. My server Matt did a good job taking care of our party. The lunch menu was good, but a bit small. I would have liked more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"You will find culinary influences of Argentina when you visit Charbar, and if you get the chance take a peek at the Argentine wood-fired grill, one of the inspirations behind their identity.  I have been here a handful of times already, and I'm slowly working my way through the menu. There is nothing I've tried and don't like. In fact I have favourites and tend to order them each time along with other dishes. Love smaller bites and being able to have several dishes in front of you at once. Every time I come I learn a little bit more about the restaurant and inspiration behind it.  Charbar, along with 2 others (Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery) are located in the historical Simmons building. When you are inside it feels like the walls and old wood posts have so much to say, I wish they could share their stories.  We were able to sit on the patio one night for my husbands birthday back in August before heading downstairs for dinner. Gorgeous views on the patio and a perfect date experience. Another time I've both lunched and dined with girl friends. Dinner meetings are lovely here as well and always accommodating. I even attended a recent wine event upstairs there complete with cheese bites.   Through my adventures the service has always been spot on. And the food incredibly flavourful. I love the variety of chimichurri sauces they have (I've tried 3: red/green/white) and as I mentioned I am working my way through the menu. One of my favourites is the Fugazza (pizza).   Charbar has everything I look for in a great restaurant. Good service, incredible food, friendly staff, a lovely setting and ambiance, even the location is easy to get to. Resos recommended."}
{"text":"Probably the best patio in town, and a menu by the team behind Charcut.  We attended a pre-opening party and I can only say: Get Excited !!!!  Go to the patio and try the Argentinian Pizza  Or get a private room on second floor for your events and functions.  My impressive so far: they know what they're doing. You're in good hands!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this space is absolutely remarkable. Went with a group of 6 and fell in absolute love with the layout, the smells, and the friendly staff.   Food was so-so for me: to start had the sourdough balls, and love love loved those bad boys. For my main I had their feature that evening that was a 7 ounce sirloin for $29 for just the steak and then ordered Brussels sprouts a la carte for my side. The steak was delicious, the Brussels sprouts (a dish that I normally love) were horrendous and inedible. They tasted like burnt nuts, another couple in our group ordered them as well and hated them.  My favourite part about eating out is ordering dessert. There dessert menu consisted of 3 items- flan, gelato, or crepes. Sorry but that is not good selection, I didn't even bother trying any of them and that is rare!"}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 10 and were stumped on what to order because everything looked so amazing! The waiter offered to hand pick a selection of favourites for the table and the food just kept coming and was incredible! We loved it all! I will say the steak was overpriced for what it is, but we are picky when it comes to our steak.   Service was great, atmosphere also great and nice that we could all hear each other in conversation at a large table. The website for this restaurant is terrible and should be upgraded to meet the standards you would expect of this type of place. Overall great place and we will return!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay the food was pretty lacklustre but what really knocked my socks off was the incredible service and atmosphere.  I don't think I'd go back for dinner but I would definitely go back for the amazing cocktails!"}
{"text":"This new place in Calgary's burgeoning East Village has apparently figured out the service side of the good-food equation. After reading reviews that raved about the food but panned the service, we were anticipating  required patience during our first visit here. We were more than pleasantly surprised. After enjoying an appie and a pitcher of sangria on the roof-top patio overlooking the bow and the Calgary skyline, we moved down to the restaurant where we lucked out in getting Cassidy (our sassy ginger waiter) as a server on his second day at the restaurant. The 28-year-old veteran of the food industry seemed to have an amazing handle on the food and we trusted him with making our choices for us, with the caveat of no body organ meats. His choices were outstanding. The tomato/tuna salad (bagna couda) was outstanding, followed closely with a ceviche and some garlic shrimp. The beat salad, broccoli is much more and better than it sounds. Short ribs, fries and then we hit the wall. Taking a large doggy bag home. Have to mention great conversation with support staff Anna, who regaled us with tales of her home country Jamaica. Lovely experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Spectacular evening! We were a table of 5 and got a pile of different things- the bagna cauda, veggie \"ceviche,\" empanadas, octopus, oysters, beet salad, chorizo pizza, clam pizza, and for dessert the milk chocolate flan, panqueques, and the apple cake. There was nothing that wasn't delicious. We also got a slew of cocktails, sodas, beers. The whole meal lasted three hours and we were very well taken care of. Damage for 5 very satisfied people was about $300, not at all unreasonable for a very, very outstanding dinner.  One more thing- Charbar advertises itself as \"Argentinian,\" but the flavours are MUCH bigger than you'll actually find in Argentina. Argentinian parillas have magnificent meat, like no place in North America, but they do not like spicy anything and it's all great quality but terribly repetitive and bland. Charbar is much better than almost any resto we visited in Argentina- we like loud, spicy flavours and Charbar has flavour far exceeding what we had in two separate one-month sojourns in Argentina."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out charbar since the Simmons building opened. Went for lunch with a friend on their roof top patio. Not overly impressed with their menu- it was pretty small and selective. But the view was great!"}
{"text":"I would give 3.75 stars. Service was great, sweet guy! Two of us had the chorizo egg sourdough dish - good but a bit too cheesy. We chose here due to proximity to MEC Fort calgary race. Good location, neat building"}
{"text":"The food here was Meh, nothing spectacular. Very plain. I ordered a side of bacon with my dish, which I found out at the time of billing was SEVEN dollars! Holy Smokes.   The real kicker was that the service was REALLY poor. We went for brunch with a bunch of girlfriends and we didn't get any coffee for over 20 minutes and no refills. She didn't even stick around long enough to get everyone's drink orders before marching off. Then when we were paying, she took payment from the table beside us and ignored all of our credit cards sitting there for an additional 15 minutes.   The signage is poor trying to find the place from the street. I had no idea it was in the Simmons building until I was actually right in front of the door.   You are better off doing Earls brunch for Brunch and that is an average way to go."}
{"text":"All the hype ruined it for me. I tried to use Open Table to make a reservation for 7 pm, nothing was available until 8:30 pm. We called and got a spot and when we arrived there were lots of empty tables and spots at the bars.   We had a great server. We looked at the drink menu and were baffled by a bunch of the ingredients. They made me a custom lemon drink, unfortunately they did not have limoncello. Food wise, I like a simpler menu. We shared a cabbage salad and the crab legs - they were ok, We went somewhere else for coffee and dessert.   And it's pricey."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service and amazing food make charbar a standout spot in the upcoming east village area. Make sure to check in to enjoy the chefs gift (at the time we went the checkin gift was fried French toast that was beyond amazing) there's great cocktails on the menu so be sure to enjoy at least one on your visit. I recommend the bourbon sour."}
{"text":"Amazing. We came for a birthday dinner. Cups were never empty and food seemingly never stopped coming. We came for a birthday event and I would highly highly highly recommend reserving the Board Room.  The ceviche! So authentic and fresh. Fried sourdough balls with spicy sauce! Cabbage salad! Tomato salad! Avocado toast. Fried eggplant. Calamari. Best meal in Calgary. Everything that came to the table was flavorful, fresh and interesting."}
{"text":"I would have liked to try Alberta Beef, and finally, I went Charbar, one of the most famous restaurants for their Alberta Beef, when I visited my sister's family living in Calgary !!  I went there with her family, 3 adults and 2 kids, for lunch at noon on Monday. There were only a few groups of consumers. Dry-aged beef is Charbar's signature, but it isn't on lunch menu, so we tried to ask a clerk if we could get it or not. Surprisingly, he accepted our request with his smile!! We appreciate his accepting our sudden request.  We ordered the 72 days dry-aged Alberta beef, \"charred napa cabbage salad\", and fries, and we got \"Bruschetta\", 1 free gift from chef, by Yelp's check-in!!  The beef was $96/32oz. It may seem to be a little expensive but is worth eating!! salad was $16, and fries was $8. We were all full and satisfied.  I strongly recommend to go there. Please try their dry-aged Alberta beef.   # I thought that \"Bruschetta\" was a free gift, but I realized that it wasn't free of charge....... :("}
{"text":"Although the rooftop patio was awesome, the service and the food were anything but impressive.  We sat for 15 minutes before we even had a menu to look at and the drinks and later on the food took a long time to be served. I ordered a burger and specifically asked how it was going to be done. I was told it would be medium rare, but what I receives was at best medium well! The burger was served with bacon on top, promised to be crispy, but in my case burnt. When I complained about it, I was told that this had been an isolated case and I would receive another one. However, the second one came with burnt bacon as well. At that point, I asked for one without any bacon and all I did was to remove the bacon from that sandwich and returned it to me. Even without the burnt bacon, the burger was one of the worst! At the end, our server told me that I should not have to pay for the burger, but she could not find the manager and I should go find him and ask to remove the burger from my bill!!!  Overall, you should go there if you want to just have a drink on a nice patio and you can tolerate slow service, but stay away from ordering food."}
{"text":"Love Charbar! My husband and I have been here 3 times now and each time is great! The service is really good and the menu items are delicious. They cater to me being a vegetarian and are good with modifying a few ingredients. My husband absolutely loves the Carbonada dish. Great flavours and great variety! Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and rooftop, haven't found a place like this in Calgary before!  Just a warning though. The food menu consists of 8 items and about 30 drink options. Considering how Charcut is a great place for food it's odd that they have a very limited selection for food. Guess maybe that's why it's called Charbar? We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, tons of options, great service and high quality food. It would be nice for a romantic date night or a gathering with friends. The avocado pistachio bruschetta is amazing. I didn't personally try the pizza but my friends gave it a lot of praise. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well . . . over a year later, we had an opportunity to go back with a large group of friends and give the place another try.  We were sceptical at first, but when the food starting arriving, I had to recant my previous review of the Charbar.  One of the great things about enjoying a meal with a bunch of friends, is that everybody gets to try more of the offerings, and this meal was a perfect example.  From the beef fat fries to the pistachio and avocado bruschetta that began the evening everything was delicious.   The service was very good, and the servers were attentive, not overly so.  The meat dishes were perfectly cooked, vegtable dishes we light and tasty and even the sourdough bread was terriffic.  One of the best restaurant meals of this type that we had eaten in a long time.  Hats off to the management and staff for pulling this off.  We had been avoiding the place since the last meal we ate here, but now we are looking forward to going back and trying some of the other creations.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Canned peaches and apples in the fruit and yogurt in August?  Really?  Maybe in the dead of winter. They need to go look at the all the fresh peaches, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries that are currently readily available in Calgary. Granted, there were 5 blackberries."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or breakfast. Charbar is located in the recently renovated Simmons building so the atmosphere is vintage hipster.  The food is always amazing and the time is to both citizen bakery and Phil and sebastian coffee make this place an absolute must on the weekend."}
{"text":"This is for the patio dining experience.  I wish I wish I wish I wish  I could give this place 5 stars, but the service was just lacking.  Our server was not at all interested in putting on her interested in helping us face.  However, we managed to get everything we needed and the food and location is superb.   Get the burger!!!  I am now on an endless hunt for chorizo bacon :)  The menu is the smallest I have ever seen.  Only a few items to choose from, but those few seem to be excellent.  We didn't eat anything we didn't like.  Hopefully they can have just a couple more offerings that are easier to share and that server has a better day.    Until next time, Char Bar"}
{"text":"I have been to Charcut several times and it has always exceeded my expectations, so I had high hopes for Charbar. With a group of friends, we decided to go as a part of the Big Taste. I was somewhat disappointed by the portioning of food and I was completely appalled by the terrible service. Though the restaurant was not busy the service was extremely slow. As a person with celiac disease it is important that I can communicate with, and have confidence in the staff. Three of the four of us decided to try the tasting menu. I inquired about gluten and made the server aware of my dietary restrictions, he ensured me that he would check with the chef and get back to me. When he returned sometime later to take our order, I asked if it was safe and he responded with a terse, \"I already told you, I checked.\" Yes, he may have checked but he did not follow up. Another server brought us the wrong drinks. Yet another food runner brought out part of our meal and was not communicative about the gluten issue when I inquired he did not seem aware. Generally speaking our main food runner was abrupt, flippant and odd. The last straw was dessert. They arrived in a staggered fashion, the food runners could not indicate which ones belonged to the taste menu and which ones were safe for me. Because of this miscommunication one of my friends inadvertently ate the one intended for me. When I tried to ask our server which one was meant to be mine, he responded with, \"I don't know, I didn't put the order in.\" (THEN WHO DID?) I asked him to find someone who knew and explained again that I am dealing with an allergy/disease and not a preference. His lack of knowledge and communication left me wondering if any of my meal had been safe. The tasting menu was not sufficient for 3 people, the only member of our party that did not leave hungry was the one who ordered a burger. I had no dessert and received a somewhat condescending apology (and bill reduction) from the manager. You shouldn't leave a place like that hungry, afraid for your health and patronized. So completely disappointing and frustrating."}
{"text":"We came here for the Big Taste so my review will be more about the experience.  I really enjoyed the ambience here, the open space, giant windows, and feeling of community with the various businesses thay occupy the space.   Our server was attentive and my steak and frites meal was tasty.  I had a really nice cocktail as well.  They were accommodating to my infant and overalll I enjoyed the visit.  The food was flavourful and my steak was done perfectly.   Will try to come again to try the regular menu."}
