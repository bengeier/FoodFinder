{"text":"Fresh, tasty and very authentic! I am definitely going to be a regular here :)"}
{"text":"I have a good Indian restaurant that I like, but it is a bit far away and not very convenient with the evening traffic. I found Matka without any previous information (they have been here for a couple of months) and decided to try them because they are in such a convenient location (for me).

I had a great buffet lunch.  Very nice naan, very nice papadums, very nice pakoras, stuff that will tell you how good a place is.  I will be back this week for dinner, for sure."}
{"text":"We were shopping around the area when we noticed this restaurant and decided to go in for buffet lunch. The food was typical south Indian with not a lot of good options for Vegetarians. 

Me and wife tried out a few dishes - Paneer dish was sweet, the Bagaire Baigan (eggplant) was way too oily. Veggie food only saving grace was sambhar.

I eat meat, so I tried out the chicken biryani which was average, other dishes were average too.

My wife's pregnant so she takes a bit long to finish her food, the restaurant server apparently didn't like that, she was trying to hurry us even though they were open for another half hour and had only 25% tables occupied."}
{"text":"Definitely good Indian food. Family came by and shared a few dishes. We had the Spring Vegetable Dosa for appetizer that was super yummy. For main course we split the Vegetable Biryani,  Chicken palak,  okra and tomatoes, and goat masala.  Everything was EXCELLENT and super TASTY! If you want good Indian food in Chandler come here!"}
{"text":"I went to Matka for dinner and found that they have a buffet.  Food was below average to average.  First of all, the variety seemed rather limited, which is surprising for a buffet.  I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.  They also had a lamb curry (ok, but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good!), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.

I think they just opened - in a way, this means that you can give them the benefit of the doubt.  I probably won't though, since I already know of other Indian restaurants that are better."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant to have dinner. I was told by one of my colleague that the food taste and options are great. But the quality and taste did not come close to what we were expecting. Seems like the food was recycled from the lunch buffet. The naans were hard like stone also the mutton biriyani tasted like eating uncooked rice. Frankly speaking I would myself cook much better then what I had experienced here. I would not recommend my friends or relative to have dinner here."}
{"text":"Matka is now Kamat... and it is all Veg restaurant now.. and the taste has been getting better and better with each of my visit. It opened as KAMAT recently and I was there shortly when it reopened... I was given a warm welcome by the Owner Lady, and we ordered some snacks.. Everything was delicious.... We had gone for lunch buffet on weekend... and Wow... It was like a royal lunch buffet.. with so many dishes spread out.. and taste.. ummmmmm... !!! At this rate I am sure this restaurant will very soon be the No.1 in the valley !!! Everything is wonderful including the people and service... Go try it today ...  :)"}
{"text":"We had been there to the lunch buffet on a friday couple of weeks ago and the food was awful. The restaurant itself is very boring with no music or ambience and uninviting. I was hoping that we get some good food there. The papadum tasted horrible probably because of the oil. The Gulab Jamoons were torn apart in the buffet tray and not even a single intact piece was there. The tandoori chicken tray was empty. They did not care to refill the empty food trays. The owner was bit rude when we complained to him of the quality. The buffet itself is about 11.95 + TAX on the week end including friday. I don't mind paying 13 dollars for the food, but not for the food they offer. Chutneys on baseline is a lot better bargain in comparison to this restaurant though the pricing is similar for the buffet.  The only +ve experience was the bottled water they offered at no extra cost and the chicken biriyani. Anyways we decided not to return to this place."}
{"text":"What most people don't realize about Indian food is that it changes from region to region. Most Indian restaurants in this country serve only Punjabi (northern food). Matka specializes in Hyderabadi food. The city of Hyderabad is known all over India for having the most flavorful food with influences from both south and north. I have not had authentic Hyderabadi food outside of Hyderabad until now. It's spicy and full of flavor. The signature dish is their Biryani. And the biryani at Matka is to die for. 100% authentic. They also have a a huge variety in their buffet with many delectable options to choose from. And dinner buffet on weekends. Food is fresh. You can taste the difference. Thank God for this restaurant. I have to eat here at least once a week out i start having withdrawals. Best Indian restaurant in the Valley hands down!"}
{"text":"In short, tasty food with a great flavor. The chicken biriyani is by far the best i have had in phoenix. I have been there for dinner (ordered a la carte') and the lunch buffet which had impressive spread. Also, they provide bottled water at no additional cost."}
{"text":"This has changed ownership and name and is now Kamat (an anagram of Matka, oddly) and is just getting started. This is the third Indian/Pakistani type restaurant in as many years in this location so I imagine it'll be tough going but they''ll have my business.

I've been to Kamat twice now and the food is just lovely. Lunch is buffet of course but for an evening meal they emphasize thali    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thali    I had a chicken biryani thali that came with rice, daal, naan, kheer and more....this was a takeaway meal,  when I unpacked it and sampled everything, it made me weak in the knees....so good!  I can't wait to go again and try the goat curry.  It's a small operation so be patient with the staff or try the lunch buffet. I could have given 5 stars for the food but it's early days yet.  I hope they can last."}
{"text":"For a place that claims they don't reheat food, it's ironic because the buffet had the quintessential \"reheated Indian buffet food\" taste. Make no mistake, this is a South Indian restaurant through and through. They can say \"North Indian\" dishes on the menu but it tastes like South Indians cooking North Indian food. Sambar is in nearly everything and it tastes sour which can tell you where the chef is from. The place was hot and muggy inside. The place had an odor and it just felt really dirty in there. I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"On my on-going quest for reasonably-priced and delicious Indian food in the Chandler area, a friend and I checked this place out tonight.  

The decor is sketchy, to say the least.  When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.

Not the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.

The food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.  

I probably won't come back here, although it was decent.  Still not exactly what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet a week after it opened, and it was really good.  The owner told me he was going to have a Friday and Saturday dinner buffet and I tried it tonight.  Outstanding!  The food was fresh and the chicken and goat dishes were very good.  But for me, the veggie daals, byranni, lentil soup and the Indian eggplant (don't remember the Indian name) was outstanding!!

The owner told me he changes the buffet each day so the food is fresh.  At  $9.99 for a very large buffet on a Saturday nite, it was more than worth a visit.

I'm going back for that mango daal, the tamarind rice, and the egg plant (whatever it's called).  In one word...OUTSTANDING!  It really was that good!"}
{"text":"You can change your name from Matka to Kamat to anything else but if you have to advertise that you are not \"recycling\" (which is re-serving one customers food to another that may have been untouched), and that all food is cooked daily, you have to seriously
wonder!

Quality of the butter chicken was ok . The tandoori chicken was dry and old and they dont follow the online buffet menu: no kheer, only sooji ka halwa which in no way closely resembles a dessert. 

I rate this as : \"been there done that\"

Naan was burnt but masala dosa was a nice touch. They also some how ran out of yogurt and couldnt make a Lassi. Thats like a wing place running out of wing sauce.."}
{"text":"Its Friday night, and it's a 1st date night, so I got to pick the place, and I had already confessed my Yelp obsession, but really is it an obsession when you are continually finding the best of places within your area? Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.

So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!

I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!

Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service!   

I hope to see Matka stays around because I sure do plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Saw an empty resturant from outside. Anyway went inside.. It was hotter inside than outside. Papad was cold and old..Sent it back. The food was expensive and BAD !! The is the worst restaurant that I have been in Chandler area."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here, especially the various biryanis they make. They change their items on the buffet each time, they told me.  

My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  

I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.

The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal. Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often."}
{"text":"Thought of trying this out for lunch buffet today..We eat out quite frequently but have never been to this one. 
Cons:
a. The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone.
b. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either ..
c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present.
d. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good.
c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice.
d. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?
e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent.
f. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani.
g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better.
h. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.

I would revisit to give them a fair chance at dinner this month.. But right now it is 1.5 stars..There are better Indian choices at the moment in the valley."}
{"text":"Tried this place on 4th of July, decent amount of folks eating there that day.

Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach.  We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.  Since it was fried, the kids loved the crunchy top.  Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.

Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.  

Recently, I was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county's health service, big turn off for any future return.  We hadn't planned on it anyway because the bill was too high for 2 entrees, one extra side of bread and a drink."}
{"text":"Went for their lunch buffet this afternoon.  The floor of the restaurant had stuff strewn all over- a turn off when you're there to eat, and fail to see how they couldn't have the waitstaff sweep the place in less than 10 mins.  There was only 1 other family dining, so clearly they weren't swamped.  
There were many dishes which included South Indian and North India.  The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.  The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread.

There was zero ambience.  It was very 'store like'. I wish all the restaurants around could take a cue or two from 'Chutneys' in Tempe.  They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.  Their flavors are unmatched. 

A $12.99 buffet needs to be worth that much, and I'm sorry, but Matka isn't worth it, but Chutneys totally is."}
{"text":"Alright here's the skinny: no beef (Indian cuisine!), lots of flavor in authentic and unique recipes, well-kept buffet fare.

  Given a table and a chilled bottle of water I got started.. Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.

  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... 

  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability... (All of which can be found at the Indian Oven in Northeast Mesa.) But overall a good bet for lunch in SW Chandler."}
{"text":"I really want to write a longer review about this when I am not sick (home today), but I've already waited too long to put up a review for this new business.

Recently my wife and I noticed this place while going for dim sum at C-Fu Gourmet, which is in the same strip mall. We noticed their lunch buffet was substantially larger than other Indian places, so we vowed to give it a try.

Like I said, more detail later, but you have got to go try this place out. They have around 19 items on their lunch buffet for $6.99 all you can eat. Their weekend buffet boasts 27 items for only $9.99. The food was up in my top three favorites in Phoenix and the service was excellent. I talked a little with the owner and he told me that everything is made fresh everyday. Nothing is left over for the next day. The dishes changed daily. You really can't go wrong here--the cheapest, the best selection, and one of the best flavor-wise in the Valley. All things considered, this is my new favorite."}
