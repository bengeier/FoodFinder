{"text":"Maribels has opened a new location! YAY!! And it's just as good, if not better, then the previous location. Daily specials include a drink and the portions are HUGE! Free chips and salsa at the table and those will fill you up pretty good because you can't stop eating them; they're that yummy! Staff is wonderful and committed to providing good food and service at a reasonable price. So my authentic Mexican food fix is back on thanks to Maribels!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the food is fresh, it's reasonably priced, and people love it! This is inside of the 4 Play Tavern."}
{"text":"Good news!  Maribel has a new home and is now open here at 4 Play Sunset! It's inside a bar again too. You'll find it right across Sunset Park and nearby Sunrise Coffee. The same sweet family still runs the place also.   For first timers here, the guacamole made in house is the bomb! So fresh. Very popular.  So don't get upset if it's sold out for the day. That's the first thing my family and friends that I bring here spread the word to their friends about.   My favorite is shrimp ceviche.  Again so fresh and light. I recall in my review from their original location my favorite is ordering shredded beef burrito wet topped with green sauce. Thanks to Sam, the young but super awesome server that suggested it.  Im liking the new digs more than the original location.  The 4 Play place is more modern looking and cleaner,  It was not smoky on this visit.  The restaurant section is enclosed.  When you walk into bar, Maribel's will be to your left. The dining area is smaller, but seats about the same number of people.That's because there's no pool table or game tables taking up space like the original place.  I wasn't on full Yelp mode since I was busy catching up with my friend Jamie on this visit. So I'll leave it up to you super Yelpers out there to snap up more pix and post!   For the most part menu is still the same.  The specials are only offered Monday - Friday though. The prices still reasonable too. Food tastes the same.  Good stuff! So make your way here if you want some good home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"Very nice people; my meal was about average. The location isn't ideal as you would never know it was here. Establishment is cash only; at least it was when I was here."}
{"text":"Haven't done a review in awhile but I wanted to do this place...first off never heard of this tavern this place shares and when i walked in it seems others have not either. It was empty and smokey and a few power drinkers, very deppressing, it looks run down and old..I proceeded to the left into the restaurant which is a separate glass case i call it and surprise! it was not smokey but still very run down.          A young man approached and very friendly got our drink ordered and informed me and my date they were out of guacamole which i was hoping to try but he offerd Pico with the chips and salsa which was good. So i placed an order of beef chimichanga, $2.00 xtra for meal beans and rice...it was quick hot and fresh awesome food!         Near the end of the meal was told they had no POS cash only and was forced to use the bar atm. He gave us a discount  on the bill but wow that was weird.. so in conclusion great food, poor decor, so so sevice maybe next time changes will be made. i feel i will come back but i can only give 3 stars right now."}
