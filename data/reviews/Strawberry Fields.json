{"text":"I went today for the first time...amazing remodeled space!  The cafe is back and the food looks delicious!  There's a ton of variety of different things.  it's bigger than the coop, and has a lot of potential over it with having the cafe.  I'm so sick of the same old thing at the coop.  The prices for some things are too high to be feasible (eg milk) but they have an olive bar, bakery, and cheese case.  I thing they should have the same cheese in this location as world harvest.  I don't know if they have a coffee bar....so happy that they're back!"}
{"text":"Never did make it to the old S. Fields before it closed down, so I have really nothing to compare this place to. However, I quite like it so far. I haven't done a ton of grocery shopping here but I have had a number of experiences eating lunch at the cafe so my review will focus mostly on that. First off, the prices are great. Finding an all natural meal while eating out that isn't going to ruin my diet is not easy, and finding one that doesn't empty my wallet is even less so, but S. Fields fits the bill perfectly . Their menu rotates every day and they have both veggie and non selections available. The staff is really friendly and are ready to answer any questions you have concerning dietary restrictions (as long as you don't mind asking...). They also have a number of delicious vegan baked goods available. I've tried the chocolate chip brownie and the espresso vanilla cupcake and both were delicious and relatively cheap. I think this place is doing a lot of things right at the moment and I plan to update my review when I get around to doing some grocery shopping there. For now though I'm happy to add another place to my rotation of lunch spots."}
{"text":"I have visited the new Strawberry Fields 3 times in the past month and each experience has been a bit sad, but this morning was the saddest of them all.  Upon driving up, the door on the cafe side was propped open but the sign on the stores doors said they were closed, yet their hours said they were opened.  The lights were all turned off.  I tried the doors and they were locked.   I walked into the cafe, half expecting that the person at the counter would tell me that the store was closed, as each time I went into the store prior to this morning, there was never another customer.  The person operating the cafe seemed a bit confused.  I asked if the store was open, trying to assess if I could shop and was then asked \"do you have a question?\"  I explained that the lights are off, doors locked, and the sign says they are supposed to be open.  I was told I could shop and check out at the cafe.   In the dark, I rummaged through the store to find the items I went in for.  In the mean time, the back room behind the cheese counter, had several employees chatting it up, never turning to see that there was a customer, the lights were off and the doors locked.  I found my items and went to the cafe to check out.  The person at the cafe apologized for the stores amateur performance.  He explained that this is not the first time this has happened.    Outside of customer service issues, the prices are a bit high.  Strawberry fields prices were always higher and for some items, I have been willing to pay the price, but I'm afraid I am done shopping at Strawberry Fields and instead will support other local health food stores.    The operation of the store is embarrassing.  I don't expect this store to stay open with such high prices, disorganization, and poor customer service.    As much as I wanted to see the store survive, it is an embarrassment to the name. I much prefer the co-op, Natural Gourmet, the farmers market, regular grocery stores, amazon, gardening or even fasting in comparison to the experiences I've had at the new and not so improved strawberry fields."}
{"text":"Nicely redecorated and good food in the caf√© section. But, very pricey. Many of the similar items are sold in Meijer at a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is for the Strawberry fields Cafe in their store.  I tried this place around 4:00 PM on a Saturday. About 6-7 people occupied the cafe around the time, but the main counter was pretty empty with 2 cafe workers. I stood there to place my order, yet it took about 5 minutes before one of them could help me. Once I had their attention, they were super helpful with their recommendations and encouraged me to try a variety of salads. One problem I noticed was that their smoothies has non-descriptive names (ex. Deep Purple, etc.) with no ingredient information on the menu board, but their server was very helpful.  I ended up trying a Falafel Wrap, A spicy veggie samosa and Deep Purple Smoothie (Grape Juice and Berries). The Falafel Wrap was good, but the Samosa was not even worth the try. The smoothie was healthy and great, but they were missing smoothie straws at the time, so the server suggested that I use the super slim soda straw to drink the thick fruit smoothie. Overall, my visit was average, at best. I understand they reopened just a few months back, but there's definitely some scope for improvement."}
{"text":"I want to update and add another star. I stopped by again last week. The service was much improved this time. The vegan options were even more plentiful than the previous times. The quinoa burger was very nice. My interns also enjoyed most of the food they ordered. I still couldn't shake my previous experiences, but this was a really good improvement."}
{"text":"Does anyone work at this store? Stood at the checkout for nearly 10 minutes before I gave up. Rang your bell repeatedly, the cafe attendant called over the loud speaker for someone to take the register, and nothing. Hire some labor, the service at this store has sharply gone downhill since the new management took over.  Overpriced, 75% of the time they're rude, and that's even if you can even get someone at a register. I get not wanting to work at the end of the day, but y'all were an hour from closing. No excuses."}
{"text":"I can't believe I took so long to visit this store and cafe! It's a bit of a small store, they have a small bakery area with cake slices, cookie, French macaroons, cupcakes. Some are gluten free and some vegan, yay vegan! They can even make a vegan birthday cake! The food in the cafe is great! A good size variety of foods, some hot and a lot of cold food items. Loved the falafel and the potato curry pie"}
{"text":"Now that I've lived in Chicago, I've become quite accustomed to my frequent Whole Foods visits. So if you have stepped foot into a WF, then you can imagine how upsetting it might be to have that experience taken away from you or out of reach.   Now, my family lives in Mahomet and I come back to visit often. I do not know how I'd survive these visits without Strawberry Fields. Yes, that sounds dramatic, but you need to understand how serious I am about supplements and herbs to know why I'm stating this. This place used to just be a fun shop to stroll through, but now I depend on it like some people depend on a Walgreens or CVS."}
{"text":"First, responding to the person who posted the review trying to bring up a race issue - while the service is not amazing, the owner is a minority and extremely friendly. Get out of here with that nonsense.  I eat at the cafe occasionally on my lunch break. The food is alright. Their options for their hot plates are sometimes pretty good, and they have plenty of healthy options. I would advise against ordering the sandwiches. The meat is nothing special and their white bread is really tough to bite through. I'm a young person and it hurt my teeth.   I walked through the supermarket. They have some unique items throughout. Some people (hipsters) might appreciate it, but this isn't somewhere that I will go grocery shopping often."}
{"text":"It's cool that they serve fresh vegan desserts. I had a slice of their vegan vanilla peach cake ($3.50). It was the worst cake I've ever had on par with those giant sheet cakes served at kids' ice skating/inflatables/laser tag birthday parties. This was my first time trying vegan cake, so perhaps what I'm about to write is a feature of all vegan cakes: the cake tasted stale, like a weird brick-- dense and fudgy instead of cakey. It tasted nothing like peach. The icing was overly sweet and tasted like the kind you'd get on a Walmart cake. You know what I mean-- that weird, powdered sugar taste... and smell... *shudder*. I felt nauseated after eating it.  One HUGE gripe: the description specifically said that the cake was frosted. This is incorrect. The cake was iced. I hate icing. Which was why I was so excited to have some frosted cake. Icing is the nastiest thing that man has ever invented. Never trust a baker that can't tell the difference between the two!  I've also bought groceries here and at the old Strawberry Fields. Still unbelievably overpriced. It felt like I was coming upon a new joke at each aisle. A pint of ice cream costs $7.29 without tax. A frozen pizza is about $14. A small bag of dried peas (with enough peas to fill a sandwich Ziploc bag) was about $5 as well. Peas are supposed to be cheap, yo. A package of cookies: $9. A small box of vegan chicken nuggets or a tiny bag of vegan meat tips: ~$15. One can of Amy's soup is $5. I've never seen Amy's products priced like this at anywhere but Strawberry Fields. The prices are marked up like hell. You can get some of these things cheaper at County Market.  I only came here to get some meat alternatives (I got two packs of vegan hot dogs for about $15), but I could never justify shopping here again for groceries or desserts. Vegan food can be cheap. But not at Strawberry Fields. Bumping one star though for carrying a good selection of vegan meats/cheeses."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by what I found inside this reinvented Strawberry Fields health market. There's a whole lot packed into the isles here. When I'm about to make some strange brew (usually trying out something from a health video), I usually can find the odd ingredients here - chlorella, chaga mushroom tea, etc.   But the real reason I come to Strawberry Fields is for the bakery. The cakes, cupcakes, baklava, cookies! They even have \"shots\" of frosting if you need a quick fix! Most desserts are $3.99, cookies about $1-$2. The cafe is separate from the bakery and has even more pastries & savoury offerings! There's a whole coffee, tea, & drinks menu in the cafe. There are plenty of tables - inside & outside - to study or hang out. Fresh bread and deli options are available in-store as well."}
{"text":"I went to see the store under its new owner. I'm so hurt that it's lost the appeal. The prices are ridiculously high, no cars in the lot and a few of us wandering through the isles searching for a reason that this new owner would trip (at least) the prices for the products. Maybe he'll just write off this business.  I'm voting for Trader Joes and I will continue to support Common Ground.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Ive stopped in a couple times since they re-opened under new management. Very happy to see what used to be several aisles of vitamins has been transformed into a neat little deli. I had the chicken along with one pasta side and a veggie side and everything was so tasty and reasonable pricing for lunch. I will definitely add this to my list of places to go for lunch. I picked up some things from the bulk section and fresh baked bread. Next time will have to look into their desserts and coffee."}
{"text":"I was planning on making banana ice cream today so walked over to strawberry fields to buy some stuff to put in it. After I paid and was walking out I decided to try a smoothie at their cafe. Up until this point the customer service was decent, though it was difficult to find someone in the store part of the building. I then sat down to wait and the person who helped me proceeded to not make my smoothie. I waited probably about 10 minutes while she helped other people; she got food for one person and made a couple of other people drinks.  I also noticed another customer, an Asian woman, trying but failing to get the barista's attention, no acknowledgement. Everyone else that the barista did help is white...  I finally got up and asked for a refund. She said \"oh sorry\" and, to her credit, offered to make the smoothie. But by that point I was rather annoyed and just wanted to leave. The refund process ended up being rather complicated and they initially didn't want to put it back on my card and just give me cash.  I won't be shopping here again."}
{"text":"Very high prices at this store but just like with the co-op I come here out of necessity rather than choice. The selection here is awesome and the baked goods are great but, like I stated above, the prices are really bad and make it very difficult for a student to shop here."}
{"text":"Strawberry Fields still hold promise for me but after a few recent experiences with poor customer service, I'm afraid things might be headed the wrong direction. The baker I've dealt with recently has zero experience with any of the baked goods and doesn't even know the names of the products. When I ask for something, she can't identify which one I'm asking for leading to lots of frustration for both of us. I came back today, rang the bell that says \"ring bell for service\", she came out and said she was too busy baking bread to grab a few macarons for me and that I needed to find someone else like one of the cashiers to help me at the dessert counter. By the way, there was one cashier with a line. When I had trouble finding a medium roast non-decaf coffee, the owner told me that the unlabelled bags were \"regular roast\" not medium roast and pointed out the obvious labels that I had seen on the other packages where the roast level was marked. What does \"regular roast\" even mean? I don't know much about coffee but I've never heard of \"regular roast\" coffee before.  Needless to say, a quick trip to pick up a small list of items turned into lots of confusion and running around with little help from the staff. It was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here in the beginning of the year and the owner was very sweet and kind to me when my credit card wasn't working (I had been traveling so the card company was confused) overall I think it's a nice place but I do wish they had more variety in their products."}
{"text":"This place is great if you have a food allergy or a restricted diet. Lots of options for the gluten intolerant or allergic, peanut allergy, milk allergy, etc. However, it is pretty pricey. I like coming here for speciality products. The service is kind of poor; I find myself waiting around for a cashier most of the times I've been in here."}
