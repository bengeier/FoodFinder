{"text":"I really liked this place...the first time around.  I ended up going for my wedding dinner.  The main courses were excellent as was the dessert.  They allowed us to bring in our own special wine for a corking charge....My wedding was on a Monday.  Did they give us a dessert for our almost $350 bill? No, but it was all good.  We decided to try it again because we all liked our dinners so much.  When my friends and I went back on a Saturday...COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL.  One friend's Pizza was burnt, another friend? the Chicken Parmesan's pasta was soggy, yet another?  She ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and then couldn't finish it because it tasted old and fishy.  The rest of us that came for my wedding dinner were wondering if we were in the same place.The service was not good at all.  My advice, try it during the week if at all.  They lost all of us that evening.  It is a very lovely, pretty place in an amazing building...I just wish we would have perhaps just stuck with the weeknight crowd."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years - always enjoyed the atmosphere and food here, but the last few times has been less than pleasant experiences. We were seated and given menus after being told to wait 15-20 minutes even tho the tables were less than 75% occupied. Another 15 minutes sitting at our table, several servers have gone by taking other orders, or carrying drinks and food without so much as a \"be right with you\" or \" just a moment\". We could see a couple of nearby servers standing around and chatting but could not get them to give us eye contact. I usually don't mind a little inconvenience if its warranted but it was getting ridiculous. We finally got up and left - not that anyone working there even noticed. That will be our last dining experience at 1855."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but, in the end, it's  flaws were too numerous to overcome: Bad service, unpalatable food and inflated prices."}
{"text":"1855 is really slipping. Right now, it's standing at the dangerous intersection of extremely average food (due to an ENORMOUS menu), mediocre service, and high prices.   When you offer a big selection of appetizers, then add chicken, pasta, fish, salads, shellfish, ribs, steaks, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pork, and whatever else, two words sum it all up: SYSCO CATALOG.  Prices start in the high teens and go up from there. And that's fine, but the overall quality just isn't there.   Our party ordered a variety of items... steak, pasta, ribs, salads. Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out, either. Nothing conveyed interesting flavors or nice skills in the kitchen. Side dishes and salads were completely uninspired. Virtually nothing about the food or the experience rose to the level of what a $20+ entree should be in the Madison area. Instead, everyone in our group just conveyed a shoulder-shrugging \"meh.\" Service was slow, but not quite objectionable. Sort of a dead vibe for a Thursday night. Quite a few servers standing around.   We're not a picky or overly critical group, but we're very good at quickly identifying either the remarkable or the half-assed. Overall, this was a $14 experience with a $22 price tag."}
{"text":"Service is ridiculous.   Went there on a Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch, and the bartender waited 10 minutes to even put our order in...and that was after we had to say something.   And no, they weren't busy.  This is so sad that this place continuously has subpar service, despite new management."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting 15 minutes for a server that never came. We were seated outside. Saw a hostess after 15 min and said our server never came. Said she would check on it. One minute later the table that had been sat 15 min after us had their order taken. We waited a few more minutes and decided to leave. We went to the hostess stand and asked for a manager just so they knew what would happen. When the manager came we told her what happened. She said sorry and it must have been a shift change issue. She didn't try to get us to stay and didn't seem to care at all. Very disappointing. The food that we saw coming out looked good but we'll never know. We had been wanting to try this place for awhile after stopping in for a drink awhile ago when there was live music. Sadly I will never come back and I will make sure to tell people not to try it either."}
{"text":"Management, please read all the constructive feedback in the other reviews here. Solid feedback to be found. I have experienced the same issues as other reviewers - nonexistent waiters/waitresses and just okay food.   The menu is overpriced for small town Cottage Grove but that's okay with me -I'd be willing to pay more for delicious food and great service; unfortunately, I have not found either to be consistently offered at 1855.   I have been to 1855 5-6 times and each time, the service is substandard. I, or others at my table, are left with empty drinks, are waiting for a bill, or waiting for a box. Key word, waiting. Simple equation for happy customers, every 5-7 minutes, check in on your paying customers!   I wonder if 1855, with they huge menu, is trying to be too many things. Please get better soon. You have amazing potential for some loyal Cottage Grove customers with money to spend.   On a positive note, I love the atmosphere, the live music, and their dessert menu. Oh, and the new Asian noodle dish is delish."}
{"text":"We just went for the mothers day brunch.  Had reservations for 10:00 yet the buffet wasn't even ready.  The food was all very good when it was finally ready but for just being put out it wasn't the hottest.   Good variety of food with made to order omlettes waffles pot roast chicken etc.  However they are not set up for a buffet....it was backed up immediately.  The area is too small to have a buffet line with people having omlettes made. The food was good and the service was terrible despite a required 20 percent gratuity added to the bill.  We had to continually ask for coffee refills.   The servers all stood to the side talking and eating.   We'll probably come again but management needs to take a look at the service or more won't return."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good at a mid-range price."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant. It has many unique items on the menu in addition to the standards. The fire oven pizza is a hit with my husband and kids."}
{"text":"As a party of six we went to 1855 for Mothers Day Brunch, we have been there before and even had our sons rehearsal dinner there.  Today being brunch (and we were aware of the cost which was a little price)  we served ourselves except for our beverages which were just water and coffee.   When our bill came tip was on it for a full 20% which was over $34.00.  We usually go to the Natigal for brunch and was never charged as if we had a sit down meal.  I will never go back to 1855 for brunch again."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It is a must stop! They have $4 glasses of their house wines and $10 pasta bowls on Tuesdays. I love their Cobb salad, 1855 nachos and gluten free chocolate tort. The service is always great every time we come. The old fashions are yummy as well."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on New Year's Eve.  A couple of the friends we were with had been there previously and recommended it.  We had a reservation and it was crowded when we got there, so we were expecting to have to go wait in the bar while they got our table ready.  Much to our surprise, they were ready for us and seated us right away.  Service was a bit slow, but as I said it was New Year's Eve and the place was packed, so I'll give them a pass on that.  They gave us complimentary chocolate strawberries and champagne to ring in the new year which was nice touch.  There were lots of selections on the beer and wine menu, but the food menu was limited for New Years.  It was pretty much all steaks with a few seafood and chicken options.  That was fine for most of us, but there were a few people that weren't as hungry and would have liked some smaller options like a sandwiches or entree salads.  Most of us ended up getting the Filet Oscar and were very satisfied.  Both the filet and the crabcake served with it were delicious.  A couple people got the $44 12-oz bone-in filet that was their big special for the evening.  Both of the people that got that were pretty disappointed they went with that when they saw how satisfied we were with our meal that was about half the price.  They said their steaks were OK, but weren't anything special. One of my friends said his steak was cooked unevenly and showed me a chunk of it that just looked like raw meat even though requested it done medium.  We'll definitely have to go back and try out their regular menu at some point."}
{"text":"Pizza is phenomenal! However this place needs a menu makeover and I'll explain in a bit. They invested in a nice wood burning pizza oven that is in view from the bar. Huge, beautiful bar. Live music in the eve.   This last time I went, I ordered the steak and my husband and I shared a large salad. Disappointing. The steak was over done, tough and tons of fat on it for a sirloin. Sweet potato fries were good but I would expect that it's a pretty fail proof food to fry up.   Back to our issue with the menu....every time we come in, we are overwhelmed by the menu. Too many options on there! Are you a specialty grill/ pizza place/ steak house/Italian/Mexican? They have it all but is that a good thing? Not in my opinion! Here's my solution and I hope this place is open enough to ideas! Since your pizza is good, I would go with Italian/American and make 10 entrees amazing and with love!! I would rather go to a place that has 10-15 amazing options that are cooked well than the 50 options you have cooked like a Denny's with tornado room prices. (Please don't do steak anymore!) Your pizza menu is great so keep that as is and just offer 3 salad options: Garden, Caesar, a salad of fresh basil, mozzarella and tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic. Chicken or shrimp extra +4.    If something doesn't change I'm afraid this business is going to fail and that would be so sad! It is a nice spot to come to in cottage grove with a nice atmosphere. Get together with your cooks or hire a professional to help you customize a menu to rock the cottage grove/east and downtown Madison area. You can do it!"}
{"text":"Came here for fish fry last Friday. Pros- they serve local/regional beers, nice decor, our waiter Mike was efficient, nice, and accommodating.  CONS - NO SRIRACHA!!!!! Fuck you 1855 for not recognizing Sriracha. Respect the rooster. Over priced mediocre food."}
{"text":"We didn't really know what to expect upon waking into 1855 Saloon and Grill. The name doesn't really fit the restaurant; instead of a bar feel, 1855 definitely has more of a classy restaurant feel, which we thought was a good thing. We sat at the bar because no seating was available on this Friday night due to the fish fry being served. As soon as we bellied up, the bar tender asked for our drink order. They have a local draft list, wines and cocktails, all decently priced. We shared a cheese curd appetizer and both had the fish fry special, which was Panko crusted bluegill with red potatoes and either a salad or soup ($15).  The cheese curds were cheesy, but the menu says the curds are lightly breaded, which is false. The breading was overly fried. Sort of a trend, I guess because the panko crust on the bluegill was a little too hard and thick for my liking, but I'm not a huge breaded fish fan. The potatoes were delicious and the salad was a nice mix of greens and fresh vegetables.   This is a nice option when in Cottage Grove, but I won't necessarily go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm in a love/hate relationship with this place. The love portion..some of the food. I also fell In love with the Ocean Breeze drink while sitting out on the patio. The hate portion..the service. It never gets better. I always say, hopefully it's improved..nope. I showed up late in the afternoon around 4. Went to both hostess tables, no one there. Went to the bar. No one there. Bartender surfaces and I say I would like to sit outside. He gives me a menu and says head out to patio I will send someone out. I wait for 10 minutes..no one comes out. I go back in again and the bartender gives me the look at which point I knew he forgot. I go back out and an apologetic waiter shows up. Were they too busy? 2 people at bar..2 people outside..and me. So frustrating for such a nice looking establishment."}
{"text":"It's a decent place that has tons of options on their menu.  A couple of sandwiches with curds.  How could you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"My date and I ended up at 1855 on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy, and we had no reservations, so we chilled at the bar for a bit.  The bartender was prompt and got us refills quickly.  That was about the highlight, for me.  Once seated, our waitress rushed us to order.  Luckily, I had checked the menu out before and had my heart set on their Strawberry Fields salad, with fresh bread and herb butter.  Well, the latter never made it to the table, and the former had about one thinly sliced strawberry on it (no lie), and the lettuce was definitely the usual bag mix, complete with random cabbage bits thrown in.  The sliced chicken breast on top was small but at least that was tasty.  For a salad that costs almost $12, I was hoping for much more.    My date's avocado chicken sandwich looked good and he said it tasted good.  I stole a few of his sweet potato fries to get some much needed carbs.    The service at the table was below average.  The dining room was messy and chaotic.  The decor is interesting and there is a huge fireplace in the front.  I suspect if you go there for drinks, it's a good place to go.  However, I heard a rumor that the place shuts down the bar at ten and everyone goes across the street."}
{"text":"The setting of 1855 is beautiful.  The food is just okay.  We thought the menu sounded more interesting than the actual meal.  Our main complaint is the service.  Staff seemed inexperienced.  If they were better trained in customer service, this place would be a 4 star!"}
{"text":"Slip sliding away...... just O.K. in all categories. This place was A LOT BETTER when it first opened. Staff is nice but, pushy to turn tables. We were there with friends we haven't seen in awhile and enjoying the evening. \"Ready to order, ready to order, ready to order\".... Staff, read the atmosphere of your guests. It's not that hard. Food was par. One baked fish, 2 deep fried and 1 scallop special. Nothing to brag about. 2 drinks a piece (8) $160 including tip. Not worth it. As the other reviewer said about the building, it is an awesome setting. Too bad it doesn't provide the full package of a night out."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner tonight. I had the cod fish fry and my wife had the poor man's lobster: Both were good, though the poor man's was a bit blan. The garlic potatoes were very good.  The atmosphere is a compelling reason to come 1855, as it is so comfort and welcoming."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and ambiance-my daughter and I sat on the patio and it was quiet with a nice view. My daughter ordered from the kids menu. The pizza was ok; the \"fruit cup\" was a dish of canned fruit cocktail. Not very impressed. I ordered a stuffed flounder. I thought the crab stuffing lacked its own flavor. The dish was covered with a good tasting cream sauce, but there was way too much sauce. I should have ordered it on the side.  My salad was quite small.  There was a nice list of wines available by the glass, and the cheesecake was delicious and a good-sized portion for sharing. If I go back I will try a steak after reading other reviews."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and restaurant looks nice. We have been here several times and food was ok. I think we were just hoping it would be better the next time. We went last night and the food was not good. My husband had seafood enchiladas and I had the shrimp scampi. We were both disappointed. :( The shrimp scampi had an awful taste to it and my husband got hard pieces of shell or something in his enchiladas. The waitress was really nice, however it took forever for our food to come. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon :("}
{"text":"I hate to hammer them with only one star but they struck out in several areas.  This is my second visit to 1855 last visit was last summer and this place has tanked!!.   My 80 year old mother and I went there or lunch today. Arrived around 1:30 service was prompt..  so prompt that you got the idea our server just wanted to get out of there and we must have been her last table.  We ordered the prime rib sandwich Which could really be a great sandwich but they take the prime rib already cooked and sliced and stick it on at he grill and smother it with Swiss cheese and haystack onion rings.  A minute or two after i ordered I asked the waitress if there was any way to get  my beef a little on the rare side to which she said it was all pretty well done.  I suppose at this point I should have asked for something else but i figured the order was already in process... they did not offer me a chance to change my order.  To say the meat was well done was an understatement as it was grilled brown and tough as a result of it.   Prime rib just isn't supposed to be abused that way.  For a side I asked for haystack onion rings which could be amazing if they didn't douse them in so much salt that all you could taste was the salt.   The icing on the cake was the fight or people yelling in the kitchen \" I don't want to get my balls busted for that\"  Not what my 80 year old mother needed to hear while waiting for her dinner.    To confirm that the waitress just wanted to get out of there our check shows up without even an offer of dessert.  We had the server bring over the desserts and they all looked decent but we figured enough was enough and paid and left."}
{"text":"We went here years ago and thought the food was just blah. Last night we returned and we were pleasantly surprised. We had the pork tenderloin and the prime rib which was fantastic. It was a huge change!  We had an amazing and very thoughtful server too. He was honest too!  The only thing that seemed overkill was the onion straws topped on everything on your plate. I felt it was unnecessary and just a little too much. They were good but in moderation. We would go back again to sample the much improved food and quality of everything."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the menu and vibe of this restaurant when I decided to get off the freeway and feed my grumbling stomach that had been driving all day.  The only way I found this place was from a tip from one of the guys who works at the gas station.  He was really excited about it so I decided to go for it.  The menu is huge!  Definitely something for everyone. Service was friendly yet efficient.  Quick to take my order, but slow to clear the plates, which was kinda annoying.  Food was solid yet a little bland.  Overall a good experience and I'd recommend the place."}
{"text":"The whole experience was not terrible but it could have been better.   I visited this place because it was recommended to us. My partner and I sat at the bar to get a drink while waiting on the other couple we were to meet. The drink menu seemed to be adequate and had a great variety. My eyes were draw  to the strawberry basil rum drink because of the type of Rum they offered (Don Q). This type of rum is hard to find in the big cities so I was surprised to found it available in a small town. I asked and the bartender said they definitely did but that they usually didn't use it to make that drink. I was shocked that they sold something completely different from what they show in their menu. I'm glad I made the distinction of asking for the type of rum I wanted. The drink was good but they did add different ingredients that were not listed in the menu.   Our waitress needs more training!!! She was a little too intense. The restaurant got busy and you could tell she was frustrated and overwhelmed. These came across as being too pushy and to some extent annoying as she wanted to remove our dinner plates even before we were done eating and asking if we wanted dessert before 2 our of the 4 members on the table weren't done eating. She completely forgot to ask us for more drinks closer to the end of dinner and to collect the dirty plates as we were done. She brought the check and we never saw her again (with the table still unclean)   Overall, the food was good. I am used to fresher products but it wasn't terrible. I had the rainbow strait with broccoli and side salad with a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. the rest of the group had fish tacos and top sirloin. I wasn't eating the top sirloin but it didn't look the greatest. Both gentleman eating the meat found it flavorful but the presentation was poor!   Recommended place for a quick bite rather than a sit down all night dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered to go. I enjoyed my meal (bruschetta chicken salad) but my co workers did not so much....I will come back and try again sometime."}
{"text":"Take out order was wrong. Got Poor Man's Lobster instead of fried cod we'd ordered. Since it was an order to go, error wasn't realized 'til we got home. Thought it would be an opportunity to try something else. But rather than being a lean fish option, it's intended to be swimming in butter. Unsalted butter. Cod was overdone, bland AND fattening. The red potatoes were also undercooked. One highlight was the excellent clam chowder. Next time we'll check the order before we leave."}
{"text":"MEH! I've been here 3 to 4 times and left disappointed all but once.  The food is underwhelming. The menu is crowded and overpriced for the area and DEFINITELY for the quality of food. The weight staff eats in front of the diners, which is a big NO-NO. They are also very slow, I've received cold food on 3 separate occasions here. Last time, I literally watched my food sit, waiting for the server to finish HER OWN mean, for over 5 minutes. When I said it was cold, she huffed at me and said \"well do you want a new one\"  This place has so much potential. But I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a long time due to average food, but pleasantly surprised tonight to find a great meal.  We ordered the chefs special cod which was lightly pan fried, served with an orange glaze.  It was delicious!  Now we're thinking we need to go back and try some other dishes.  Much improved over what it was!"}
{"text":"I could go with 3 or 4 stars here.  The service was great (Rachel), so I'll bump it to 4.  Cheese curds were good, but a little pricey ($9).  The rest of the food was ok, nothing to complain about but nothing stood out, either.  Would like to know more about the pizza; didn't see any pics on yelp nor anyone eating any...maybe next time.  Food came out lightning fast.  Casual but non-divey atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Service is good and food is too. Suitable for my wife and me or our whole family."}
{"text":"A group of six went there last night and my husband and I were really disappointed. The last few times we've been there, it hasn't been very good, but last night was awful. I had chicken fajitas and there were about four or five thin strips of chicken and lots of sautéed onions and peppers. I was still hungry when I finished it and I don't eat very much.  My husband and someone else in our party had hamburgers, and they were awful. Very dry and tasteless. This restaurant has really gone down hill. A good example of how they are trying to cut corners is the fact that the water down there A1 sauce. It was runny and watery, not thick."}
{"text":"The construction in Cottage Grove made this place very hard to find, but when I finally did, I was impressed. Lovely exterior and interior of building, very friendly staff and amazing wood fired pizza oven. The pizza was absolutely delicious and, by sitting at the bar, I was able to watch the pizza cook in the really cool wood fired oven. This place is off the regular Madison beaten path, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went here today, a Sunday afternoon around 12:30 with a friend because she recommended it.  It was quiet and we were told service might be a bit longer because they only had 1 waitress. Despite it taking a little extra longer than normal for the waitress to first appear, it was normal-paced service after that so that was good. I got the Carnitas Tacos (comes with 3) which were actually pretty fantastic.  Their guac and pineapple salsa come on the side, along with pickled onions.  The guac had a nice little kick to it and the meat had good flavor.  Other than them being a little too \"juicy,\" thus making them a little messy, they were better than I had expected.  The outdoor seating area was big, with nice tables and good options in the shade or sun.  I'd go back here and probably get those tacos again...!"}
{"text":"We met family to celebrate graduate school graduation.   Party of 10 accommodated nicely.   Food was Great!   Started with hot multi-grain roils.   I had the sirloin steak with a salad and veggies.   Delicious!    Prime rib looked yummy.   Scallop dinner was good.  The prices range from 18-28.    It was the best meal all weekend ."}
{"text":"So the saloon was pops' idea, and the sad thing is it is a really good looking restaurant - gorgeous interior, great pictures from the 18 and early 1900's, a wood fired grill, and a great atmosphere.  But it is all show and no substance.  1855 has no soul.   I've been here three times now and each time left me disappointed.  The first time I ordered Bruschetta and they served it to me first before telling me they were unable to toast it because their grill was down.  It was not good.    The second time I was at 1855 I ordered the Reuben and it may have been good except the toast they served it on was soggy on the bottom, like it had been sitting for a while before being served.  Plus no thousand island dressing, and that might as well be a crime where I come from.    Pops wasn't happy with his Panini, and I gotta say it didn't even look appetizing.. another crime in my book.    A new lead cook is in order.  Possibly stricter adherence to food ethics.  1855 is a mighty good looking restaurant with nothing to offer once the lust is gone.    Don't you just hate that?"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink and live music"}
{"text":"My second trip here. Service is good, staff is very friendly.  The bartender is great. The food is a bit bland for my personal taste and over priced. The atmosphere is pleasant enough and comfortable.  It is very clean, including the restrooms and does have a nice decor.  If not for location and family member preference, I must admit that this would not be my first choice at which to spend my money. I wouldn't mind stopping in for a beer or cocktail; the bar is roomy with a good view of multiple television screens."}
{"text":"They have a good beer selection and it's a cute place, but I've been here twice now and both times I've been disappointed by the food. Not good at all."}
{"text":"We live in CG and used to come here often. Their food and service are very inconsistent. I have had excellent meals and not so excellent meals. Same with the service.  I have had their steak with the stuffed shrimp on top and it was sensational! Their wood fire pizza is also delicious! Burgers are good too. Their fried pickles are delish but the breeding falls off. We ordered their app sampler once and that was not good at all. It was cold and tasted very processed, definitely frozen.   Service is also hit or miss. Our table service has always been good. Bar service is a little different. They have one male bartender that is extremely arrogant and seems to be \"above it all\". He acts as if he could care less, injects himself into conversations and can be condescending. He does however make great drinks... When he's not chatting up the waitstaff or the attractive single women.   That being said, I have never had terrible service or a bad meal here. I will be back. Depending on the night you could have three stars or five stars."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I (around 12 of us) came here on a Wednesday night at 8:15 to celebrate the end of a long work night. When we arrived, we saw several other customers as well as a musician playing. The bartender quickly wiped off our table and took our order. So far, things were great! However, after we received our first round, things took a turn for the worst. No one came around to ask us if we wanted a second drink, and bartenders were passing by our empty drinks constantly .We had to get our second drinks at the bar. Around 9:20, after the musician had left, other customers were on their way out the door, but the 12 of us were still there enjoying our drinks, appetizer and conversations. As soon as the last table of two left, the two remaining male bartenders immediately turned down the lights, brought us our check and told us they were closing, basically telling us we had to leave. Their website states that they are open until 10:00. One bartender even asked one of my friends if she was done with her appetizer yet, which she was in mid-bite eating (and there was plenty of it left). It was obvious to us that they just wanted us to leave. They did not offer to separate our checks, so we had to write our names on the check next to our orders in order to have them separate it. We felt unwelcome and very disrespected."}
{"text":"Good food, but a little pricy, really not for children. Nice atmosphere and nice people!"}
{"text":"Time to give 1855 another chance.  We had a $5 off a $25 \"pocket peeler\" coupon so we stopped in for dinner tonight.  I'm giving them one additional star because unlike previous visits from years ago we were actually served and our waiter (Nathan?) was great.  I had a few questions and the menu and he was able to answer them all.  I got the BBQ sandwich with chicken instead of beef and was very underwhelmed.  We eat out in part because we don't like to cook and also because we don't consider ourselves any good at it.  This was a something I could have made at home.  It was simply grilled chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and an onion ring.  The chicken was a bit burnt and oddly the flavors just didn't come together for me.  I get a similar sandwich at Red Robin and love it.  Hubby, on the other hand, scored virtually a home run on his pasta dish which resembled a thai dish with thin noodles and veggies.  I should have sampled that after the disappointment with my sandwich.  Overall left unsatisfied.  We have one more coupon I'd like to use and if we get around to it, I'm going to try the chicken chimichanga based on a tip that said it was good.  I did originally asked about that in regards to the bean and rice side which they weren't willing to substitute without incurring an up charge.  We'll see what I decided when/if we go back."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place. They have amazing signature cocktails to choose from. I prefer going for lunch because the menu is different than their dinner menu and better priced. I tend to get the same thing each time I've gone for lunch. I was there this last weekend and ordered it again but was a little disappointed because they changed the type of meat they used. Also this last time I was not too fond of the waitress but that doesn't mean I wouldn't go back. They still have good food. I typically get the Border Burrito (cheddar jack cheese, rice, ranchero sauce and seasoned ground sirloin and roasted chicken topped with ranchero sauce and cheese). The disappointing part was that the sirloin is now ground."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Big menu with lots of choices - comfort food, light fare, sammys and burgers - anything for any body. BUT, we were there last Saturday night 9/24/16 and saw that the menu had shrunk. Our server, who was very pleasant and accomadating reported the restaurant had gotten rid of 3 pages of menu items. What was left was boring and unappealing. None of the 4 of us could decide on dinner because nothing was interesting.  I chose a Reuben sandwich which had dried out corned beef. My husband had an open faced prime rib sandwich which was supposed to come with gravy and mashed potatoes. No gravy and Luke warm potatoes. The garlic Parmesan French fries consisted of a dozen fries with a little grated Parmesan on top. The place which is usually busy was fairly quiet for a Saturday night - very telling.  NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner on Main St. Cottage Grove! Excellent gluten-free menu for those with the food allergy. Good service with decent prices. A lot of TV screens so you don't miss the big game and an extensive beverage menu."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars but my experience was par at best. After seating ourselves, we ended up waiting more about 15 minutes before the waitress came around. We saw her walking around to other tables and checking on them.... No luck for us. Then after taking our order she forgot our appetizer. I understand if your understaffed for a Friday night, but write things down if its too hard to remember. Overall the food is great, the atmosphere is relaxing and the beers are cold! The prices are fairly reasonable too, $30 for dinner for two people and drinks! The deep fried pickles are also pretty unique, a 1/4 of a pickle spear deep fried!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch and beers before a wedding. Definitely exceeds the good things I've heard. Next time I'm in the area, I'll stop again for a pizza! Andy, our server was great and helpful with making selections. We both did a Madison brew (and wound up swapping) and split a (loaded) veggie pizza."}
{"text":"Calamari was dry as sand...all else mediocre. To be honest the Reuben was good. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Cannot stand this restaurant. The food is sub-par and the drinks are nothing more than kiddy cocktails. The manager (Owen) is rude, loud, and terribly demeaning. There is not a small-town atmosphere or anything close. Take your business anywhere else in the town and you will be much better off."}
{"text":"Agree with the opinions that this is a nice looking place but food average, over priced, service levels real spotty.  Live nearby and avoid."}
{"text":"We enjoy both the food and the serivce.  Fairly large bar area.  No Smoking is nice too."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit disappointed with overall experience here. As other reviews state, the menu was large and seemed to have a lot of good choices. We started out with the Deep Fried Pickles and the Cheese Curds. Although both tasted pretty good, the amount of cheese curds received, is definitely not worth $8!  For my main course, I choose the Margherita pizza with pesto. The flavors were all great and I could tell the ingredients were all very fresh. There was one big problem though, the dough was still very doughy!  The others in our party seemed to enjoy the food for the most part, nothing really to rave about.  Overall, just ok..won't be going out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"Living in Cottage Grove, 1855 has become my husband and my go-to when we are too lazy or tired to make dinner and/or are craving a drink or two. That said, we always order the nachos, which are splendid, so beyond that, I cannot speak to the food.   Very frequently, there is a musician playing soft guitar music and singing slow vocals near the bar, which adds to the rustic ambience of the place. The bar-staff has always been friendly and on top of our orders."}
{"text":"Our server tonight was much better than previous experiences however the chef must have had the night off. Our medium steak was served rare and our med-rare steak was served medium. My shrimp was served severely overlooked and inedible.  The server corrected the undercooked steak but failed to address my uneaten shrimp that she took away with my plate.  Overall another disappointing experience in Cottage Grove."}
{"text":"The most fantastic meal I've had in a LONG time. Our server Andy was excellent! Food was over the top amazing and the atmosphere was beyond pleasant. Definitely coming back again! Thank you all for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"1855 has great food but it's a hit or miss for me. It's either excellent or just mediocre. My family went for a holiday brunch once and it seemed like they catered to the restaurant...just average buffet food that you could go anywhere for. I do like the restaurant though and I try to go just in case the food is great."}
{"text":"Seriously, stop giving this place a second chance.  It's way below average food at way over average prices."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect coming to 1855 from other Yelp reviews and limited information about the place. My fiancee had been there in the past and so had his parents, so we went for Friday Fish Fry with my parents and his to try it.  The place was busy and filled to the brims with customers. We had planned this dinner in advance and with fish fry being a popular Friday meal, we made reservations just in case. The fish was good and wasn't the greasy beer battered fish you find at a lot of places. It was beer battered but really crispy. Their fish fry comes with red potatoes (not the typical french fries) served over a piece of toasted bread and a choice of cole slaw or salad.   They also had a musician playing live music, which was a nice touch. Overall, I tend to like old rustic buildings turned into restaurants. You do get that feel in 1855.  The fish was good but I'd like to go back to try something else on the menu as it is hard to mess up a fish fry. I will say prices looked a little higher for most menu items, so just keep that in mind if looking to dine here. Also, to comment on service we had no problems there at all. Our waitress was very friendly, came back many times to ask how everything was and refill drinks, and overall did a good job on a busy night."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on a recommendation from friend.  I wasn't sure what to expect since the reviews from other Yelper's was limited and not favorable.  The place was busy and packed with customers...so it has to be good.   There was a musician playing live music, which added a nice touch. The facility is designed and made to feel like an old rustic building turned into a restaurant. You do get that feel in 1855.  Adult drinks are mixed well !!   I ordered the \"1855 Steak w/cheese and garlic fries\" and wife ordered \"Filet mignon w/mash potatoes\".  Both meals came with salad.  Both meals were cooked to order and tender.  Prices were a little on the high side \"for me\", but you get what you pay for....outstanding service and an excellent meal.    Staff was very friendly and came back many times to ask how everything was and to refill drinks.  Great job considering it was a busy night."}
{"text":"Ribs were some the best I've had. Service was excellent. Will deffinatly going back soon."}
{"text":"I came here a few Saturdays ago with some coworkers for a going away party for one of them. Parking is very easy as there is a lot across the street and even more behind the building. A friend and I arrived before everyone else did so we had a seat at the bar and had drinks, the bartender was courteous and suggested a drink for my friend.   When the rest of the party arrived we sat down and our server took our drink order and explained the daily specials (prime rib). The table ordered calamari and it was good, not rubbery and served with a marinara sauce. All of the entrees came with salad, it was a basic side salad with a choice of house made dressings, I ordered the lime vinaigrette and it was very good, very limey.     My entrée was the Prime Rib 10oz cut, cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes. It was good, the prime rib lacked seasoning, but overall was a good dish.   The restaurant has a woodfired oven right in the bar for pizzas, but the oven wasn't working that day.   Breads and desserts are made in house.   Good overall meal in Cottage Grove."}
{"text":"Went in tonight to eat and drink at 7:45 pm tonight. The place was empty and we did not even get acknowledged. We left and will not be returning. This is not the first time the service has been poor but I thought I'd give it another chance."}
{"text":"Place was practically empty.  Waitress were standing around watching TV.  Had $10 pasta bowl special.  Nothing special about it.  Pasta was dry and not creamy at all.  Came with chicken on top that looked like it was out of a bag, not appealing at all.  Had a key lime martini, for $7.00 it was the smallest martini.  Will go to Toby's for my key lime martini."}
