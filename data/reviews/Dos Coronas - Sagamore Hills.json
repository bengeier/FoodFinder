{"text":"We were excited to see Dos Coronas finally open but we were disappointed in the service as well as the food. The no margaritas on Sundays was the final straw."}
{"text":"I love that this place is finally open! The one flaw is that I don't think they were ready for the large amount of business that they were going to get. We went on a Friday night and the place was PACKED! It looked like the workers did not know what to do though. We sat in the bar area and had to wait a lot to order drinks, get chips and order food. The bartender would disappear to go do something else and leave people hanging. Luckily we were not in a rush and were in a very forgiving mood. The food though was excellent. We had the fajita for two. The meat and shrimp was cooked very well and that left me with no complaints. We also ended up back there Saturday during the day to meet friends for drinks at the bar. Same story on the service. Had to wait a lot for drinks and to also pay my bill. People just seemed to disappear elsewhere. Hopefully the bad service is because they just opened because the food was very good and the d√©cor inside was very nice. I will still give this place another shot hoping that it changes quickly."}
{"text":"I'm always up to try good Mexican food. This place did not disappoint. We went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy. Many diners were enjoying these huge frozen margaritas. I had the taco salad which was very fresh and enough for lunch the next day. My hubby had a burrito and enjoyed it also. Place was super clean and service was great. Only reason I did not given 5 stars was I thought the prices were high for a shopping plaza Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food itself was on par with many Mexican restaurants in the area. Our service this night has atrocious. A male server in his mid 20s was more interested in flirting with his female coworker than tending to our table.

The margaritas here are not good. Tastes more like pre made mix with ice than an actual marg.


I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. We were passing through the area and stopped here based on the reviews.   We weren't disappointed.  The chips and salsa were excellent?.  We tried the fajitas for two  really enjoyed the dish.  The Margarita's were a little on the weak side however."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a good number of times since they opened. I hav ordered many items from the menu and every item I have tried has been very tasty.I try to stick with meals that arent too spicy so i alternate between the tcos, pollo loco, chimichangas, taco salads, and fajitas. The salsa spice level is very inconsistent. It  is sometimes very mild and sometimes much spicier but has been  everywhere4 in between. Most of the time the food is served pretty quickly, even when theyre busy. There was a quality curve when they first re-opened but I think they have found their groove. Also, some of their booths are a tight squeeze."}
{"text":"I'm from California and I love this place. It is adorable inside, and the food and service are great!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience this time 

We waited for over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. Then we waited another 15 minutes for our drinks. And we didn't get chips and salsa until we got our drinks... 

The most horrifying thing was when our server came to take our order, she put a tray full of dirty dishes from another table onto our table. On top of my mom's flatware. And one of the dishes fell onto my mom's lap. That is the most disgusting and unsanitary thing that I have ever experienced at a restaurant... GROSS

We ended up leaving cause there was a medical issue. But this was the worst experience we've had at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was so excited that Dos Coronas was open again, but that didn't last long. We were there for over an hour and still didn't get our food.  I had asked for a refill of chips and salsa and never got it, and had an empty glass the majority of my visit. We ended up leaving without our food, and won't be back."}
{"text":"Have eaten there 3x. Decent Mexican entrees. Good margs. Close to home. We like the atmosphere and good tvs for sports."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service and margaritas I've ever had... margaritas are all sour mix the food is over priced for portion size and the service was awful my husband and I will never go there again that's for sure"}
{"text":"Since we eat Mexican almost weekly, I vote Dos Coronas as having the best chips and salsa which is always fresh and delicious. The service is great.  Never disappointed and always can find a coupon."}
{"text":"Great place with great food. Really good value in the combination platters. I personally recommend black beans over the refried. The staff is very friendly and food is usually out ver fast. The atmosphere and everything is spotless and pretty."}
{"text":"It would be nice if they answered their phone so I could place a to go order. Called a dozen times and no answer. Went to Tacos Mexicanos instead! Adios Dos Cornoas"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food and cocktails in a fun and modern atmosphere. Definitely try the Cantarito, it's not on the menu but is a refreshing Mexican cocktail with tequila, grapefruit soda and orange juice. Crab quesadilla special is excellent, and you can taste the quality ingredients in the fajitas. Absolutely will come back!"}
{"text":"They are finally open! We are here today and they are still as tasty as they were before. Very friendly staff who seemed extremely happy they were back in business. I've missed them terribly and I'm so happy they are back! Again good was tasty and prices are good. We will be back. Most likely every Saturday."}
{"text":"Our daughter loves this place, so my wife and I have made 3 visits. My opinion is that it is good but not excellent. I have experimented with my orders and absolutely loved my very first order (#13) but am so-so on my next two. My wife enjoyed her meals. 
We will continue to patronize this restaurant/bar and I am hoping I have more excellent experiences."}
{"text":"Recycled chips, poor service... we used to be good customers... sorry not coming here any more"}
{"text":"Had horribly slow service. It took awhile for a server to even take my drink order. Food came out within a minute of ordering. Food was mediocre and hardly warm. Place does look nice inside. I will be going to Tacos Mexicanos over here any day."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Chicken and steak was cooked to perfection and the quality of meat was outstanding. Had guacamole and was like I had in Mexico. No Sunday liquor license yet but still go. The atmosphere is beautiful. Can't wait to eat outside when the weather permits."}
