{"text":"Only real choice for real cantonses food in Brampton.   Do not compare to Richmond Hill,  markham or scarbough. 


I come here once a year to visit .   Good authentic chinese food. 


Beef tendor loin
Lobster   hk styles
Fried rice Ying yang 
Gai lain
Cold bbq platter      
Soy a sauce chicken



It was ok and not that oily.   But nothing standout but nothing bad"}
{"text":"We have been getting take out here for years. Typically order the chicken crispy noodles, general tso's chicken (super spicy), and chicken balls. We both love the crispy noodles a lot! The chicken balls are a little larger then they should be resulting in an excess of breading and not quite crispy enough balls. The meat inside does seem to be white meat and is usually a good quality. I don't love their sweet and sour sauce- a little too thin/runny. The general tso's chicken should be smaller pieces and slightly more crispy. Otherwise the food is great. We keep going back!"}
{"text":"My husbands grandparents love this place because of the service. Today however the waitress not only screwed up our order and forgot our bean order. We reminded her 25 min after placing the order (there was only 1 more table with customers so def not busy) and we ended up cancelling our bean order because we had finished eating!!! I only came for the beans since i find their dim sum below par. Emeralds is so much better."}
{"text":"As far as REAL Chinese food goes, this is pretty much the only place I know of in Brampton. Dim Sum on Sundays is good, food pretty authentic whereas other Chinese restaurants offer \"westernized\" versions of food."}
{"text":"This is probably my go-to dim sum place in Brampton. My family used to come here and the dishes have improved now. They make the dishes hotter now and with quicker service than other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the worst meal I've had in Brampton. Everything tasted odd and seemed like the worst quality. I also feel like I was ripped off since our bill was $50 for 3 of us and we didn't eat a lot. The receipt didn't break down the items. I felt like the owner just pulled out a random number. On top of all of this we all felt sick to our stomachs for the rest of the day. I've had better dim sum at sushi restaurants. I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The same carts going round time after time. If you don't speak Chinese, good luck on finding out what some of the dishes even are. Bland food, grumpy servers, over-priced for the small portions, out-dated and dingy decor. Ok but just not good."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kingsley for years, the food and service has always been great. If you're looking for a local Dim Sum place without trekking to Markham, Sauga or Downtown then this is the spot. The carts go around til about 3, then you can order a la carte. 

Brampton's hidden gem of Dim Sum."}
{"text":"I felt totally ripped off tonight at Kingsley. I had not been here for about 4 years and remember it being a decent dim sum joint. When I walked in, it looked tired and in need of a renovation. Not many customers. The menus were old and sticky. I ordered a lot of dim sum. I have had much better dim sum at the local Oceans supermarket. I was completely shocked when I received a bill for $95. 

I am never going back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here with family.  Dining experience was pleasant as it wasn't busy.  Ordered from the deluxe combo menu and assorted dim sum dishes.  The complimentary house soup starter and red bean soup dessert were nice touches.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dimsum cart service during lunch on Saturday.  Above-average quality Chinese food -- granted there are not many choices here in Brampton.  Congee had a faint smell of something burnt today, so I give them 3 stars for food quality, 4 stars for service."}
{"text":"It's gonna be the best you get in Brampton, although that's not saying much. Typical dim sum service where they push the carts around the tables and you take what you want. 

I've always went here during my childhood. It seems though that (like any other place) the prices have hiked up. Some dishes that were marked as \"small\" are now medium and large, so each dish is way more expensive than before. Literally all my favourite things to get are considered large now... :(

Pricing aside, my go-to dishes are always har gow, steamed rice rolls with shrimp filling and deep fried taro with minced pork stuffing! 

I definitely recommend going as a group as you get to try different things. I also find it a lot cheaper than if you go with just another person."}
{"text":"The only Dim Sum in Brampton and not the greatest place for it either. The food isnt horrible, but I would have rather driven further out for better quality Dim Sum food."}
{"text":"To be honest if you are going to this place for dim sum you should always make sure you get a receipt of the breakdown because I've been here several times and especially when you have a big group they tend to overcharge you. 
Their dimsum isn't that good, I had better, but if you live in brampton this is the only place for dimsum :( sucks to live in a small city. And because they don't have much competition for dimsum they get away with serving low quality ones. 
As for their Chinese main dishes, they are average. I find people go here because it is pretty spacious when compared to the smaller sized restaurants."}
{"text":"Been going since I was a kid. If you go before 3pm they push the carts. This is one of my favorite dim sum joints. Always consistent"}
{"text":"worst dim sum ever eaten. with party of five, eat a few night ago

they r the only chinese restaurant in town offer dim sum. i thought we'll give a try. some friends give good reviews. what a disappointment!!!

Service: horrible, really cold, not even a single smile. feels like you owe them money by eating there.  you have to ask for salt pepper chili source, soy bean source, which should been stable for each service table.

Quality: worse than Supermarket dim sum, feels like they were make in the morning,been left for most of day, then microwaved before they serve. Congee is so bland with few scallops and shrimps inside, so pathetic, taste like leftover. are not fresh at all. 

Price: horribly overpriced. dim sum is at least 1 to 2 dollar than Mississauga and Scarborough. the portion size so small for congee and regularly dishes, you pay same amount money, you can at least get one and half portion with much great quality in Scarborough. they even charge for tea, which no other chinese restaurant do.

decor: horrible, feels like you stuck in 70s, the carpet and drape hasn't been updated for 20 years. really depressing.

avoid this dump!!  seriously, not mentioning GTA, smaller Cities like Guelph, Kitchener offer better Chinese foods"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times. It is normally always the same experience:

PROS
- Pricing is good, I dont think its too expensive
- Food is delicious

CONS
- My fiance and I are white, and I dont want to accuse anyone of anything, however there are many of times someone with a cart of food will walk right by us looking the other way
- Many of the \"cart walkers\" give you the food without a hello, your welcome or smile, really bad service


FINAL OUTCOME
Although the service isnt great, I do really like the food, so Ill go back once every 4 months to satisfy my craving. I do think that they should just create it like a buffet where you can walk up to get your food and someone standing there can check off the receipt stub. That would help with having to wait for food your looking for and illiminate rude staff who walk right by you."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I guess kind-of liking it is good enough.

It seems to be the only traditional dim sum place in Brampton with cart service and everything, yay! And BBQ duck on rice, ahhh, I didn't know I could have this in Brampton!

The food itself is not fantastic though it's pretty good. The service was friendly, though their English is less than great and they miss some things.

For this quality of food, it should probably be cheaper (paid about $50 for two for lunch) but I'll probably be back anyways because it's close. Could be much better but I'm glad it exists I guess."}
{"text":"This is my first time going here since it's out of my way and I was randomly searching for food to eat after traveling to the area. We were greeted with average gesture. There was only one other family table in the restaurant at lunch. The way it looked like that the place was closed but it was not. The employees who worked there were looking at us expecting us to give them lucky envelopes for service. I found a piece of hair in my dish and something that look like nail clippings. I returned the dish asking for a new one. I get the feeling they will cause more damage due to the complaints. I don't think I will be returning back."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to Chinese dimsum place.. so I decided to go last night (new years eve). Their food is delicious I have to give that to them but their service is horrendous.  We order our food and the first three dishes that came out were bbq combination (bbq pork and roasted pork) then bbq pork fried rice and fried noodles with beef.. like i said the food was good but what are we gonna do when the bbq combination comes out first and wait 20mins for the noodles and rice (and we were hungry) we ordered dimsum we got our chicken feet after 20mins waiting then the Lotus ball and squid tentacles 30mins later.. the waitress even said we ordered alot for only 3 people but if we waited any longer we would end up leaving starving.. 2 tables left cause all they got was rice and waited for a long time for the dimsum. So i got fed up and said to my family were leaving when I went to go pay our bill the lady at the register was rude I told her I wanna pay my bill and if I could get a discount for waiting so long for our food her respond was dimsum takes 1-2 to come out.. that's bs. I tried to explain to her that we waited for a long time and the servers never told us it would take that long or check up on us if we need tea or water. Then the lady asked if I'm taking the rest of the stuff I ordered I said no I'm not waiting any longer I want a discount and going to eat else where.. she gave me 10% off not even the taxes.. we got three dishes rice noodle and bbq and dimsum 2 small dimsum and 1 large and came up to 50$ it's too much for small portions of food and adding rude and lazy customer service.. not going back any time soon"}
{"text":"The weekend is the time to go...the food is hot and fresh and there's the most selection. Dim sum is good, comparable with downtown Toronto. Good value as well. I'd have given 4 stars if the selection during the week was as fresh as it is on weekends."}
{"text":"Quick dim sum at lunch.  Not the best I have had, but it fills the hunger gap.  

It's nice when you ask for something and they bring it to you.   They're good like that. 

Worth a try if you're in the area.   I've now been twice in the last two weeks and my craving is done."}
{"text":"This restaurant in my opinion, is not an authentic Chinese restaurant. The food tastes Western and smells like it too. The service is okay and the restaurant decor could be better. The food does not taste fresh (Disappointing since they are located beside a supermarket with fresh produce). This restaurant was a huge disappointment. However, I would recommend this restaurant to non-Asian people."}
{"text":"We had dim sum here today and the food was okay but the service was quick. We headed to restaurant for around 12:30pm. When we sat down, carts rushed to us and provided us with sui mai, har gow, congee and many other items. I like how their dim sum was served cart style instead of menu style. They also offer dim sum all day. As I began to eat, I noticed some of the items were not as hot as I would like them but perhaps it was due to them being in carts. The dumplings were filled generously and the service was attentive. For seven items, the total came to $37. For a person who lives in Toronto, I was shocked at the price however seeing that there aren't many dim sum options in Brampton, that may justify the price."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have eaten here numerous times. And still we can't get the house soup to come with our meal even if we spent over $50 for two people. We tried asking again last time and the owner was so quick to rudely interrupt us with a big NO while we were still speaking. 

The owner, never says hi to us although we've been eating there over 7yrs. 
Another time, they overcharged our bill so we brought it up to their attention. The purple hair lady started laughing in a very rude way as she walked away... I can go on and on with countless examples of horrible customer service experiences at this place. 

As for the food, it isn't bad, nowhere near the best though. They're lucky to be the only big Chinese restaurant in the area. Food is also overpriced if you compare it to similar Chinese restaurant. If you still insist on going, Peking duck here is actually good. 

Customer service is a joke here. They need to up their game, I don't know why it took me so long but yes Kingsley, I'm finally breaking up with you.
Good luck and maybe I'll give you another chance, when you change ownership."}
{"text":"This is the worst yet.  The owner thinks that he is the only one Chinese restaurant in Brampton and vicinity. True, and you are also the #1 in everything: #1 in worst  service, #1 in worst of lousy Chinese food, #1 in worst of staff attitude and the best of all the owner's attitude towards his patrons, he picks the patrons to acknowledge them even thought we supported him since grand opening, we were there for a numbers of years and we still being ignored.  Read on this is not only happened to us alone. They proud themselves of being the first full sized restaurant in Brampton and they should proud themselves of the worst in Brampton and area.  We stopped going there. I usually give good reviews to restaurants but this one is off of my list to dine in. Not now , not in the future.  Mississauga has many far much better.  If Yelps has a minus rating they will get the lowest minus score.

PS.  Check your checks before you pay.  Chances are you're being overcharged. Happened many times.  It was a joke when I took the check to the purple haired lady behind the counter, she laugh as it was being normal."}
{"text":"Nice place for dim sum! Not terribly amazing, but I thought it was nice for large groups.

Old fashion carts and they come around frequently. Very spacious. I didn't foot the bill, so not sure about the price."}
{"text":"Kinglesy Chinese resturant has the best Dim Sum in Brampton. I have been coming here for years... Saturday's and Sunday's are always a good day with carts till 3pm. It's fast, fresh and decently priced!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese option only if you're in the area.

Came here for dinner after a long trip and family (who lives in Brampton) suggested we go to a nearby Chinese restaurant. While I was hungry, I did enjoy a few dishes, especially the bak choy with mushrooms. I actually loved it because it was juicy and the vegetables were fresh and so were the mushrooms. Yeung Chow friend rice was also tasty but it was so yellow, it worried me that they threw a whole box of MSG in there. The chicken was really yummy as well but nothing special. 

It's crazy how the place is so big, yet there were only 5 different tables (including us) dining. The food is nowhere near how good you can get in the city or in Scarborough, but it will suffice as \"better than take-out.\" There was a bit impatience in service, but that's pretty prevalent in most Chinese restaurants; nothing new."}
{"text":"Only place in Brampton for that true dim sum experience.  The food here is good... not great.

They certainly know that they are the only place in town for dim sum and dinner menu... their prices are not the best and portions could be better.

I do like seeing regular staff there and they are friendly... its nice that they remember you and greet you.

Big dining area.  Good for booking an event.  If it is a smaller party... there is a seperate closed party room out back.

Washrooms are your typical chinese restaurants... not the most stylish and can do with some touch up; declutter and paint."}
{"text":"Big chinese restaurant
Only one in Brampto  that serves dim sum.
They host wedding events... so on weekends... it is vest to call in to make sure the restaurant is open to the public.

Prices tend to be a bit on the higher side... but agian... only Authentic Chinese restaurant in Brampton... and only one that serves dim sum with the push cart service.  Dim sum can be order in the evening dinner menu also.. off their all day dim sum menu.

No complaints on the taste and portions."}
{"text":"Recently went to Kingsley with a few coworkers, as they had been there before and enjoyed it. Given that my neighbourhood has plenty of delicious dim sum options, I am always skeptical of trying somewhere new. Call me a dim sum snob if you must, but I like what I like.

Kingsley is a large restaurant, which on the weekends must be very helpful. On a weekday afternoon, looks sad and deserted. They do unleash a handful of carts with a selection of items but you can also order from a handy picture menu.

The food here is average with varying degrees of warmth and/or freshness playing a factor in my rating. If I were to pick out some notable meal items, Har Gow (packed with shrimp!) and Char Siu Buns (packed with pork). 

Nothing special overall. But I suppose if it is truly the only dim sum option in Brampton, you can't complain. Or take the drive to Mississauga!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few large Chinese restaurants in Brampton.  And by few, I mean probably the only one this size if you ignore the HUGE Mandarin near Steeles and 410. Brampton is not known for their Chinese restaurants and this place is a perfect example of that.  It's recessed from the main road, tucked away in a mall that is not in good shape, and I think the McDonalds that shares the same plaza sees more action than this restaurant.

When you first go here, you may raise an eye brow and wonder if you should have treked another 30 minutes for Chinese food.  Though the room is really really big, it just feels like the traditional Catonese restaurants of yesteryear... and I mean, not well maintained, rushed and clipped service, and lack of attention to detail (there are more chips on these plate edges than a bag of Lays).  The menu is written in English and Chinese and of course, they have the 'secret' Chinese menu where the good stuff (and deals) are only written in Chinese.  Servers here do speak in English but you feel like they're doing you a favour by speaking English.

Dim sum here is not great and it all tastes as if it came from the frozen section of T&T or some other Chinese supermarket.  It's gummy, watered flavours, and the dough skins are just too thick.  The a la carte dishes are passable.  It's better than food court and most Chinese Canadian restaurants in authenticity but that's like saying Harveys has more authentic burgers than McDonalds because it's 'grilled over a flame'.  Chinese vegetables are fairly fresh.  Tofu dishes were subpar and the seafood that came with it was overcooked.  The beef dish was really heavy on the corn starch in their sauce and it had more shine than the beloved Camaro that sits in my neighbour's driveway.

Overall, I'd say if you're REALLY desperate for Chinese food in Brampton, then this would be ok but I'd strongly recommend to just head maybe 20 minutes east to The Grand off of Dixon road for some really good Chinese food."}
{"text":"The only dim sum in brampton, like tremendous in Mississauga.  The dim sum is alright and there are choices like tremendous."}
{"text":"OVER DAMN PRICE.. Was billed almost $100 when we only ordered 6/7 dim sum dishes. 

I usually go to tremendous in mississauga and usually pay $60/$70 for the same amount of food.."}
{"text":"We come here every year for an event, and every year the quality of the different dishes in the fix course meal changes. There really is no consistency here, even in the cookies. This year, we found the dishes to be over salted and the red bean dessert was burnt - for all 15 tables. The price is decent, which I guess is the main reason why this event is hosted here all the time, but I wouldn't come here otherwise as there are many other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for DIM SUM. I have been going here for years,  and will continue to go here for years to come. 

On my last visit it was just my father,  mother,  brother and I and we were able to get everything we wanted. 

 Yes,  the servers don't speak the greatest English but they are friendly and I think that they recognize my family so that always helps .  

We paid 50$ in total (with tip).  We usually spend around 80$ I believe,  but in my opinion it's worth it.  

I don't know of any other dim sum places in b-town,  but I don't think it would really matter to me.  I love this place! 

(also they have free WiFi,  and a \"mall\" connected to the resturant so we always go the the bakery they have and pick up some movies!)"}
{"text":"Ben coming here with the family for over 10 years!
Great dim sum place in Brampton."}
{"text":"Loved coming here until this incident. Ordered my favorite dish, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf. Open it up start eating. Half way through notice a large bug in my food. I instantly lost my appetite. Definitely not coming back."}
