{"text":"Amazing! Did a string art workshop for valentines day! Anita and Gord were absolutely wonderful, friendly, and funny. Great atmosphere. Very welcoming to beginners. Definitely something new and exciting for me. Overall great experience. I'll definitely be coming back!  Richard"}
{"text":"A friend and I came for the watercolour workshop. We used our groupons and paid the tax at the counter. We were early so I ordered the chocolate cake and toasted coffee almond black tea, both of which were amazing. The owner and instructor then went through some watercolour techniques before we started on our paintings. It was a fun and relaxing workshop, and the owner has great taste in music. I've recommended this place to other friends."}
{"text":"Amazing experience  I went online and was looking at all of the paintings that you can choose to do. I finally settled on one and signed up for the class to paint it but it was a class late at night so there was just my friends and I there. We were allowed to choose from any of the paintings that we wanted. This was great because we all had different ones that we liked. The painting instructor was very nice and super helpful, I never imagined that I would be able to paint something that looked like this and once my paint was done I was super happy with it. I would defiantly go back again and it was a great girls night out."}
{"text":"OFFICIALLY MY FAVOURITE PAINT SPOT! I hosted a small baby shower a couple of weeks ago and beginning to end it was amazing! Firstly Anita was super friendly and accommodating for the planning session. On the day of the event, most guests arrived 30-45 mins late because of highway closures and Anita was a GEM! She assured me not to worry and there were no \"set times\" to end.   As for the actually art session...Marley the instructor was awesome! Anita also popped in and really helped out to get us moving along since we had dinner reservations. The set up is the best I've seen...each person can paint whatever they want. None of those \"everyone paints a boat sailing during sunset\" cheesy stuff (unless you're into that). Instead, everyone got to express themselves however they felt comfortable doing. All the guests had SUCH an amazing time and at the end, Anita had the guest of honours painting framed as a surprise. Definitely planning other events there!"}
{"text":"With the art instructors' mentorship for the world as we know it workshop,  I was able to bring out my inner artist. So the concept is simple, they provide the tools and paint brushes needed so it's like a restaurant for your creativity where you 'dine in' and not have to worry about 'washing the dishes' later, which is of course a bonus for convenience. But what makes this place unique is that i got to eat and drink from their cafe while painting.  I especially love the dulce de leche macaroons. They cater from all over Toronto  so  next time I go there it might be something different. It was a lot of fun and I was able to take home my masterpiece of the end of the day with pride."}
{"text":"I went with my Groupon and since my first experience, I recommend this place.   Its a coffee house, with a ginormous table in the middle with an art studio at the back.  From the Groupon, you can choose which class you want to take and we got the watercolour.   The instructions were only in the beginning, give you an idea of how to use the watercolour, then for the next 2.5 hours, we just painted.   The venue is super nice, great ambiance. The added bonus is you can order a dessert or drink while painting.   When I saw the example of the watercolour that they did, I was so intimidated. But, since they give you a mini lesson in the beginning, everything turned out okay.   I recommend this placefor everyone to try.  Last note: If you're doing a painting or watercolour, please, please be careful not to splatter on the work of the person near you. It happened to me and messed up my final work. It's not the end of the world, but it's not cool. It also the  happened to the girl across me, splattered by the girl beside her. So, please keep that in mind if you do decide to paint away."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came here for a work/ team outing and found all the staff were super attentive and helpful with ensuring you have a personalized experience.   The variety of what you can do is also refreshing: they have examples of what you could do or they'll help you on an idea of your own. Love the freedom.  All in all awesome experience. Thanks Paint Cabin!"}
