{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, very few people in the restaurant. My friends and I had starter and the main course, didn't see the dessert on the menu. I had a daily soup which was tasted like some kind of mixture tomatoes and spice. I prefer my friend's onion soup, which is awesome. It has a lot of cheese on the surface of the soup. For the main course, we had duck confit, loin of the lamb, and beef tartare. All the main dishes were good, especially for duck. But be aware of that beef tartare was very small, it's not enough for a dinner."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago and it was abysmal, but given our history with the place were willing to give it a second chance.....  big mistake.  Right across the board, our party of 6 all described the food as disappointing.  It's a shame when a formerly awesome restaurant slides into mediocrity, sadly this is very much the case with Le Papillon.   I will say that the service was absolutely incredible both times we went, however even this isn't enough to get us to return."}
{"text":"Went to le papillon for dinner tonight. The wait staff were really friendly and so was the chef. Food was absolutely amazing- my partner and i both had: *French onion soup *Pea and broccoli soup *Crab cakes *Casoullet (omg YUM) *Lamb loin  Great selection of wines too. Premium dining experience. Menu had so many delicious things to choose from, and was so innovative.  5/5 would definitey come back for a meal!"}
{"text":"Popped in for Sunday brunch and my quiche was so greasy and full of fat and salad was overdone with vinegar. However the butternut squash soup and sandwich that we ordered was delicious Service is excellent and I will be back to try something new, just not quiche again!"}
{"text":"Winterlicous tonight. For $25/person you won't go wrong. We had lamb shank and duck breast. Portion not huge but you get appetizer, main dish, and desert. Environment is what you expected in a class A French restaurant. And it is casual so you don't have to wear tux."}
{"text":"Snugged in an antique brick house located on Front Street in the  vicinity of St. Lawrence Market, Le  Papillon is great for savoury french  crepes. When I first walked in the long front glass doors, I  found  myself stepping into a casual yet romantically-lit dining room with  beaming pine ceilings.  Looking for an affordable salty fix, I ordered the \"de la mere\" crepe.  Before the crepes were served,  the  waiter first came over with a tray of  fresh warm bread with soft churned butter on the side. Shortly after, the  waiter brought over the \"de la mere\" savoury crepe wrapped in a square-  like shape with speckles of black pepper finely sprinkled topped with a  piece of lemon. The crepe was thin and airy with a shrimp and scallop  filling passionately smothered in a soupy white wine and tarragon cream sauce. Although delicious, the portion size was not very generous. One crepe definitely did not fill me up.  From a pricing standpoint, Le Papillion would be leaning towards the higher end. Without any appetizers and desserts, I spent a whopping $17 on savoury crepes. Though I must say, the ambience of the restaurant and delicately composed flavours makes up for the overpriced crepe.  If you are looking to try out Le Papillon, I suggest you check out their website for their daily 10% off coupon."}
{"text":"You have not lived until you've had their tarte au sucre!!!! It is amazing!  Wonderful service, wonderful food! We were so happy to popped in on a Saturday night and had the best meal of pork tenderloin, turkey and stuffing, and escargot. Our server was great! romantic, fun, elegant, all rolled up in one! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this French bistro was for a weekend brunch.  Considering Le Papillon's long history in this city, and the premium it charges compared to the cheap-and-cheerful brunch places that abound downtown, we were woefully disappointed by the food.  The daily special appetizer, dough-wrapped goat cheese served with jam and mixed green salad, was excessively greasy and sloppily presented. The salad was an overly dressed soup of romaine and iceberg lettuce.  The mains were only silghtly better. Eggs benny were unremarkable. The croque monsieur sandwich was drenched in melted cheese, but seemed to contain no ham whatsoever.   Even the bread served at the table failed to hit the mark. Based on the Papillon's brand, we were hoping for a warm baguette with whipped or churned butter, but instead received cold dinner rolls with tiny diner-style packs of butter.  Cocktails were mediocre. The $8 mimosa special was small, and seemed to be mostly concentrated orange juice.  Service was inattentive. We had to flag down a busboy each time we needed a drink refilled or a plate cleared, and our server never bothered to ask how we felt about the food.  I won't be back for brunch, but I may reluctantly give Le Papillon a second chance with its dinner menu."}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious... the portions are tiny and it is clearly not fresh!! The crepe sticks to your teeth, and the quinoa \"salad\" was overcooked. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Brought Mom out for a birthday dinner tonight and it was a real treat. Three words. French onion soup. That, fish and a few choices from the aperitif menu. Soft music and a very pleasant French speaking server. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of eating onions but I had a taste of my friends French onion soup and it was to die for. I would definitely order this if I ever went back to Le Papillon on Front. Problem is, I probably won't go back. I found the entrées to be overpriced for such mediocre tasting food. I ordered the New York Steak Frites which was cooked med-rare (what I had ordered) but it had a burnt taste to it. I also tried a bite of my friends Florentine crepes which I thought tasted bland.  The service and the décor of the restaurant give this place points but the food won't be bringing me back."}
{"text":"After a decidedly successful excursion at the St Lawrence Market, I'd worked up a sufficient appetite. I passed Le Papillon on my way home and, while it was past my normal brunch time, I was starving, it was empty, so I went in.  Good:  - the service was good (minus the normal Toronto \"please fill my water glass as I am DYING OF THIRST m.o.) - my latte was good, but not as good as Bar One - my Ouefs Florentine were good - the hollandaise sauce was delish -- super lemony and buttery  Bad:  - my eggs weren't nearly as hot as they should have been - the portions were okay  Overall, my experience was good, but nothing more than good. I probably wouldn't go back, although the crepes sounded interesting. A good place for a good egg, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed here. The food is always lovely, they change up their menu from time to time but keep their signature staples (french onion soup, crepes) which is really nice.  I love some of the other reviewers who say they are annoyed the titles are in French... when it's a French restaurant and authentic French food... I suggest you be annoyed if you ate at a French restaurant that didn't have any French in the menu!    Anyways.... lovely setting with exposed brick, the single washrooms lined up at the back are my favourite. They make me feel like I'm eating at someone's house. I always have something different when I'm there but I am impressed with the quality o the food and the prices. Since Bistro 990 (RIP) was closed down, I come here for some quality French fare!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for brunch. We went on a beautiful Saturday morning. Sat outside on the patio and the view was great!    We ordered the peameal bacon sandwich which came with the best frites (French fries) I've ever had and the brunch platter which, essentially, was a deconstructed eggs Benedict. Very clean bathrooms and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A disappointing, inconsistent mix of very good and not so good. Lovely omelette, nice salad, terrible French toast, and signs of corner-cutting. Every bar and bistro in France has lovely orange pressé -- what in Canada we call freshly pressed or freshly squeezed orange juice. Le Papillon insults its customers by serving up bottled juice and garnishing its French toast and other things with fake 'whipped cream'. I haven't tried the onion soup or crêpes, but suspect they're on the menu's better side. I did try the 'famous' dessert and found it cloyingly sweet and the caramel topping devoid of the expected taste of butter.  On the hottest days of summer, they were offering hot broccoli soup, while I was craving (and expecting) a lovely, icy vichyssoise."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Saturday before heading over to St.Lawrence market. Right off the bat the service was fantastic. My friend & I split 2 dishes. We had the Croque Monsieur which was Amazing. The bechamel sauce was out of this world. We also has the Salmon Crepe, which was nice but a little underwhelming. The quality of the ingredients used was truly top notch. The smoked salmon itself was heaven. But the actually crepe was slightly overdone. I did order it without onions which may have been why it was also just a touch bland, but it could maybe use a little sauce/dressing/cheese to pull it a little more together. Overall the experience was definitely enjoyed & I would give this restaurant another shot."}
{"text":"Steak frites was absolutely buttery and tasty. Server was attentive. Large sized restaurant. Excellent overall."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Toronto last night for a show.  We had dinner elsewhere but decided to try something else out for dessert.  This restaurant came highly recommended.  We informed the host that we were only looking to have dessert (I would have also had a glass of wine but my friend is pregnant, so she wouldn't).  The host sat us but then informed us that we had to spend a minimum of $18/person in order to eat there.  We sat and took a look at the dessert menu and the waiter came over.  We told him we probably weren't staying as we weren't not going to spend $18/person on dessert only.  He looked confused and asked us who told us this \"rule\" existed.  When we said the host he went over and confirmed with him then came back and apologized.  He tried to suggest a litre of wine and desserts but a litre was too much for just myself.  We left and on our way our the host apologized but seemed insincere.  We went somewhere else and had dessert and it was amazing ;). Obviously this isn't a common rule because we had no problem having just dessert at another restaurant.  Needless to say I will not be recommending this restaurant or giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Visited Le Papillon on Front for the first time on Friday night.  I live in the neighborhood but for some reason never went here.  I'm raising a service dog puppy and he was with us and it was the dogs first time inside a restaurant.  The staff at Le Papillion were awesome. They we so accommodating for the dog (brought a water bowl) and a table that really worked for him to lay on the floor.  They knew the drill not to touch the dog too.  The food was excellent and our server Adam was fast, efficient and very effective and fun!  Thank you for making my first experience in a restaurant with a service dog a wonderful one...I hope other restaurants will be as great."}
{"text":"As we strolled through the St. Lawrence Market neighborhood we came upon Le Papillon.  Superb brunch menu.  I wasn't hungover but if I was this place has some of the best egg sandwiches around.  Sunnyside side egg with ham on a huge piece of french toast.  Oui Oui!  Thorough and friendly staff.  The cute little tables and chairs outside reminded me of my days in Marseilles.  Ok I've never been but I did see the French Connection several times.  Next time I hit a rave in Toronto I'll be sure to recover at Le Papillon the following day.  Merci!"}
{"text":"I really was expecting the food to be great, but left very disappointing.   The seafood crepe has a good amount of scallops and shrimp but the bechamel sauce was tasteless and bland. At some point when the seafood ran out i felt like i was eating crepe with thick cream.   The seafood fettuccine was less than average.   The apple crumble was mushy and had a strong taste of baking soda.   Really bummed out :("}
{"text":"Good ambiance. Sadly the quality of the food was very pedestrian. The smoked duck breast was extremely dried out and tough. The root veg that accompanied the entree was haphazardly cut and unevenly cooked.  The special of the day was a quinoa crusted salmon which was slightly off-putting due to the starchy raw flavour and texture of the grain. The shrimp that were served on the side were rubbery and not fresh. To the chef's credit, they were deveined.  The French onion soup was good, Though the broth was slightly thicker than normal."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and very friendly staff, but the food wasn't the most appetising. Giving it 3 stars because the wait staff and deserts made up for the disappointing main course."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious lunch with 14 people for a birthday. We all found the food to be quite bland and not worth $24. In addition, there were multiple bugs in one of our bread baskets, which was dealt with by moving the table the bugs had crawled onto. When it came time to pay the bill, the entirety of everyone's individual bills was put onto one, which was fine, but they decided to collect the money from each individual person instead of allowing us to put all the money together and give it to them. This resulted in them claiming we were $18 short despite that almost everyone paid tipped at least a dollar extra over their bill with included tax and tip. As the birthday girl was ready to leave and was not in the mood to argue, we paid the $18 and left on a sour note feeling very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and timely service. Recommend the Caesar salad but not so much the crepe. At first the crepe seemed to spark my interest however it lacked flavour and quality. The menu does offer some interesting options and I would consider coming again. Beautiful brick building inside and out."}
{"text":"Off & on, whenever I visit Toronto,I have usually ended up \"here\" ok, their other 2 locations, which are both different now.  We had a server that has been around 4ever.  He seemed a tad tired, slightly  annoyed, and uninterested with his serving & job overall.  VERY bored.  But it was with good company, the bottle of wine was nice (albeit we had to usually pour it ourselves - I hate that - you pay more than double in a restaurant for the courtesy, the ambiance, and the of course, the service.  The bartender was completely lacking in any suggestions of wine, or the questions I had about any of them.  That really bugs me - especially since all the wines Lists in Canada are completely different than what I am used to in US.  That said, the décor is a bit like being in an old brick factory/printer/warehouse from the 1920's, but was a good change from the norm.  The famous French Onion Soup was really good (but here's a secret: Costco now sells individual frozen French Onion Soups and seriously?  They are just as good!  I know, hard to believe, but that's just my opinion).  Overall, there was nothing exactly 'wrong' nor 'bad', and it was not really a let-down or ruined our evening, I was just disappointed at a restaurant, who has been around about 30 years, to not excel on all levels."}
{"text":"They serve a worthy Steak - Frites with a very tasty brandy peppercorn sauce. It can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is but overall great value and good service."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and found the service to be nothing special. The beef bourguignon crepe was fine, but not amazing either. My friends felt similarly about their dishes, as well. Bottom line is that it's good, but there are better places to go for the price point that would offer better flavours and dishes."}
{"text":"J'adore Le Pappillon on Front!!! My fiance and I have been here two Valentine's Days in a row and are likely going to make this a tradition.  I'd been here years ago and had had a wonderful experience which was why I booked us a table last year.  Each time, the service has been incredible, from the time you're greeted at the door to the time you get your bill.  The food is exquisite, reasonably priced and artfully arranged. I have dreams about the chicken in the peach brandy sauce and the chocolate mousse is the most ridiculously delicious dessert I've ever had. You'd also think that because it's a busy night, they would have limited the menu or the food would have tasted like it had been prepped earlier and sat around to save time.  Not the case, the service was prompt, the food fresh and the server checked in with us more than once.  The restaurant itself is quite big but still is cozy and warm feeling.  It's nicely lit, not so dark you can't see your food or your friends but dim enough to be a nice romantic setting. I love this place and we'll be back, likely long before the next Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Good restaurant great mussels. Seating is good and inside the restaurant is clean and comfortable. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Tracing memories leads to risky undertakings, and so it is that after not having been to Le Papillon since sometime in the late 1970s (when it was on Jarvis St) there was some trepidation in revisiting the place ... but it did not disappoint, on the whole ... the menu is still French, the wines are interesting and reasonably priced, the service is what it should be, with all the right touches, and the dishes live up to a standard, on the whole .. my bouillabaisse was flavourful but missing the stew component, which was the main reason I wanted to try it .. the menu even offered a description that suggested there would be a stew and tomato-Pernod sauce but I could not find the stew ... the Québécois Sugar Pie was delicious, albeit it miniature in relation to its price, but not in relation to what one needs to eat at the end of a meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by the food quality. The poutine was extra soggy, the lamb was hard and the crepe was honestly crappy! That being said the ambience is good and service was decent."}
{"text":"Went with my gf for our anniversary at this restaurant. Excellent decision!  The decor is beautiful - nice ambiance, upscale and romantic. The entire staff was amazing, from the person that sat us at our table to our waiter. All spoke French as a first language and the impression was really nice.  We started with the escargots and the Papillon salad - both excellent choices. The escargots were delicious with a nice garlic butter sauce. For the main we had the New York steak et frites and the Filet Mignon. The filet mignon was one of the best I have had in a long time - amazing peppercorn sauce that had a little ting to it. Really amazed with the flavour. Washed it down with a nice French pinot noir. For dessert we had the creme brulee and the pouding chomeur (the second one a traiditional Quebec dessert but using caramel instead of the traditional maple syrup). Still excellent. Because it was our anniversary we got some champagne at the end. Nice touch from them. We loved our evening. Classy place, great food, excellent staff and a great night out in town. Strong recommend!"}
{"text":"Been there many times and always enjoyed my meals and the exceptional service. Today, I've decided to take my friends from out of town to try their brunch...utterly disappointing!  I ordered the Crepe with salmon...came in quick however was super dry and the salmon was tasteless. Also, the service while ok is not what I came to expect from them. The server was passive aggressive and our table of 5 felt restricted and dumb when asking questions about dishes they wanted to order!   I couldn't complete my salmon crepe and had to sent it back. To be fair, they did remove my order from the bill and while I appreciated the gesture, I left hungry and disappointed.     I'm not sure if I would ever go back for brunch, obviously it's not the same kitchen or service staff that I got accustomed to."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for over 20 years - in their 3 locations. It was one of my favorites. I was there about a year ago last and have things changed.  I should have known since more than 1/2 the tables were empty on a Saturday night - I've always needed a reservation in the past. (Post Review Note: True to Sean's response that 8pm may have been a bit late for a full house)  This restaurant used to have the best french onion soup, escargot, caesar salad and crepes in the city.   The onion soup was below average - pretty bland and almost no cheese at all. The escargot is now in a puff pastry. The pastry was obviously frozen  - not done in house - the snails were like rubber. The salad was all pepper.  (Post Review Note: I upgraded \"horrible\" to \"below average\" and yes we did finish the soup as 2 of us shared one small soup.)  I didn't even attempt to have a crepe since there are only 6 on the menu now - none of which are the old staples that kept people coming back. (Post Review Note: maybe I should have tried a crepe but there was no appealing items on the small crepe menu).  I starting discussing this with the waiter who then started to walk away in mid sentence. I told him I would appreciate if I could finish before he walks off.  Post Review Note: waiter was having a bad night for sure ...)  He told me \"new chef\" - took the escargot off the bill and called it a day.  Post Review Note: I've upgraded my star rating as I appreciate Sean's comments. New chef is supposed to bring new life to a restaurant, unfortunately for me it was not what I had come to expect and thus the extreme disappointment. I wish Sean best of luck with his new format for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Le papillion is a great spot for drinks and dinner after work. It's minutes outside of the financial district just before St Lawrence market.   I came here after a work event with a friend and must say I was thoroughly impressed from start to finish.   We were greeted promptly and escorted to our reserved table closer to the back. Our server definitely fit the ambience. He had a french accent and was very pleasant the whole time. He gave us enough time to decide what to order and was on cue with the delivery of drinks and our courses.   The food was great. All my courses had great flavours. I am giving this a 4 because although the food was great, it didn't blow me away. It didn't make me feel like I could only go to this restaurant to get it.  Overall though, GREAT service! (Who says the French are rude?!-not here)  Lovely ambience!!  And solid food. I will return even on a non winter licious occasion.!"}
{"text":"Crepes are one of my favourite foods.  The smell alone gets me excited.  I'll eat them salty, sweet or plain.    We tried Le Papillon for dinner and I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant was extremely busy, which meant the service wasn't fantastic, but in the end we were able to get everything we wanted.  My crepe was overflowing with seafood and a rich sauce.  It was very filling, but so delicious I had to finish it.  Unfortunately, I didn't save any room for dessert.  The presentation of the food was very artistic too."}
{"text":"Amazing service and atmosphere. Definitely an ambiance conducive to an anniversary (as on our occasion). The food was good. My scallop appetizer was cooked to perfection and my favorite dish of the meal. The lamb was also good but did not quite have a wow factor to elevate it to great. I suggest the martinis and a patio table if in the area."}
{"text":"Summerlicious dinner was hit and miss. Specifically, the smoked salmon-topped mixed bean medley was a miss. The salmon was all right but the beans tasted like they'd been out for a while, to the point where my stomach actually felt bothered by it. Not enough to deter me from eating the braised lamb shank, which was thankfully good. It came in a red wine reduction with mashed potatoes and veggies, which were unremarkable.   The cheesecake was probably store bought. It would be shameful if that was made in house since it didn't taste fresh. It was okay for what it was.   You can skip this place for Summerlicious. Perhaps they perform better for regular dinner service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I'm in the area, I wish i lived closer to this place as I know it would become our go to but I'd so be broke. We've been a few times before for dinner and I hope to soon try their brunch but waking up on the weekend to go downtown from vaughan isn't in my cards this winter. The prices here are reasonable for exceptional food. Entrees are between $20 to $30. You see different types of people, young families, seniors, couples, friends... Its a mixed crowd.  The staff is great, I called 2 hours before dinner time for a reservation and they were able to squeeze me in. We got there 10 mins late and they seated us right away at the window at the front! Super romantic especially as the Xmas lights are still on the trees.   We tried the winterlicious menu. $25 is an amazing deal. I got the chicken pate, that came with a wildberey jelly. Yummmm, I wish I had more than four pieces of crostini,luckily we didn't touch our bread yet. Dave got the escagot that came in a cream sauce. Loved it. Also four pieces of crostini, so he used the bread to finish the sauce as it was delicious! (We've had their escargot that comes in a pastry filled with the same cream sauce, that is amazing! A must try!)  For dinner I had the duck confit and Dave got the lamb shank. His came with a mixed beans and veggies while mine had mash potatoes and steamed veggies. Our meats were fall off the bone delicious. The duck was nice and crispy, I didn't want to share. It also had the wild berry sauce.  For the dessert, I was hoping for their torte or sugar pie but they only had cheesecake and brownie or sobret to choose from. We opted for the cheesecake and brownie. Which was just okay.  I enjoyed the dinner. The waitress was excellent, very attentive and happy to be there. Actually I left my phone on the table and she ran out on the street to the corner to give it back to me!! I really appreciate that!   Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"My favourite comfort food restaurants in the city.  Great food, well priced, nice wine list.  The pouding chaumeur is to die for!!!  We never miss the opportunity to eat here when we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and got a table outside on a marvelous, sunny Sunday morning.   The food was ok - we ordered crepes and eggs madeleine. Crepes were kind of overdone on the outside.   Service was ok - our server was very friendly but because it was very busy it took a while to get our food.  I'm giving my experience at Le Papillon On Front  a rounded up 3.5 stars.  With its tall ceilings, exposed brick interior, and elegant decor, I would imagine this would be a nice place to bring a hot date for diner :D"}
{"text":"Lovely food, great atmosphere and very friendly and seasoned staff. I read reviews and noted the inconsistencies in opinion. Our experience was great and I would gladly go back and recommend this as a great location to try."}
{"text":"Lorsque la France vous manque rien de tel qu'un petit tour au restaurant Le Papillon, j'ai testé ! Et j'ai adoré retrouver les crêpes de France dans un cadre chaleureux, des serveurs très aimables et heureux de faire partager leur passion pour la cuisine française!"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious (lunch) and the place was surprisingly quiet...no need to make reservations on a Saturday afternoon. The food quality was not spectacular, but portions were big and we were very full from the meal. Definitely better bang for your buck compared to other Summerlicious restaurants that I've tried in the past.  Ordered the quinoa (plain but good), chicken teriyaki sandwich (filling but nothing special) and apple crumble (would not recommend).  Staff was polite.  Would recommend if you are looking for a nice restaurant with good ambiance and fills your stomach."}
{"text":"Maybe I got lucky but my recent foodie experience at Le Papilon was one of the best I've ever had.  After visiting the St. Lawrence market, I wanted to treat my wife to a Sunday brunch. I quickly cruised through some reviews and Le Papillon On Front stood out. Both good and bad reviews about service and certain types of food but overall better than average. Sounds like I need to make my own judgment. OK, je vais essayer (Ok I will try it!).  Nice little al fresco patio in front of the main entrance but a little too chilly for us to dine outside. Quickly looked at the menu posted on the front window. Crepes - SOLD! Walked in and I am welcomed with a café/wine bar that separates the front and rear dining areas. The host greeted us and we were quickly seated to a table beside large windows that brought in just enough lighting to make us feel comfortable and warm. I took a quick peek behind the bar and was amazed how large the rear dining area is. A little darker but the lighting from the ceiling and wall sconces added to that romantic, fine dining ambiance.  After looking over the menu and trying to make a few indecisive choices, our server Tom, quickly introduced himself and asked if we were ready to order. We asked if he had any recommendations with their crepes list and he quickly pointed out 3 popular dishes. So we decided to try the St. Laurent ($15 - strip bacon, fresh cooked apples, cheddar cheese) with a side of maple syrup (extra $2 - You gotta have this!) and also ordered the Croque Monsieur ($15). \"With a fried egg ($2)?\" Tom asked. \"Sure why not!\" I replied.  Our food arrived in just a little over 15 minutes. The portions of each ingredient were spot on. Crepe cooked through perfectly. The combination of lightly salted bacon, the slight tarty taste of the cooked apples, melted cheddar cheese, and the oh-so-sweet taste of true maple syrup is an absolute must-try.  But wait, the Croque-Monsieur! Well it becomes a Croque-Madame when you add the fried egg (I'm still scratching my head why adding the egg makes it a Croque-Madame). Black forest ham, béchamel sauce, and more cheese please! A little bit of green salad topped with a vinaigrette dressing and a side serving of crunchy French fries were both fantastic. But the egg on top of the Croque-Madame just made the dish. I mean breaking the yolk and having it mix in with the béchamel sauce just tied everything together. What I love was that both dishes were great to share.   The service was excellent! Tom checked up on us, gave us time and space to enjoy our food. Even after waiting for the bill, the host was gracious and helpful to take our plates away while speaking a little French on the side. It was the perfect Sunday Brunch!

{"text":"Wanted to try some fench food for summerlicious, and le papillion was the most convinient. I was a little underwhelmed by my experience, but in fairness, summerlicious is a diluted experience of a restaurant. All the meuu items looked delicious, and if given the oppurtunity, i would try its full experience.   Right off the bat, the service was good. Water was always full, waiter was polite and patient, and food arrived promptly. However, the patio is quite small and the table is quite cramped.   The appetizer I got off the summerlicious menu was the smoked salmon, which was very bland. It felt like they just took salmon out of a package and threw it on a plate. I would suggest that you get the salad or soup for summerlicious. We got all the entrees available for summerlicious (the fish, the chicken, and the pork), and all provided the french flavour I expected. The chicken was moist, and had a terrfic sauce on it (the name escapes me), the fish also had unique sweet flavour; being seasoned with mangos. The pork, however, was a tad dry, but the wine sauce and mushroom made up for it. The desserts offered were also amazing, but the crepe had a strong liqour taste.   Overall, the food had the quality and flavour, but I expected more for the price. Again, it may be diluted, because of summerlicious, but it is a nice change of pace for someone used to constant asian food. Would I recommend for summerlicious, maybe not. I just expected more from le papillion."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I had better feedback to offer after dining here today for a business lunch. I guess I was holding the establishment to the same standard as it's sister east end location, Papillon on the Park. Unfortunately, the downtown location can't even compare.  The Galette Florentine was crunchy, not airy or light at all. There was but a whisper of cheese and béchamel in the centre. All around the edges, it was just folded, dried out overcooked crepe.  The onion soup at the park location has this wonderful light quality with a thin, wafer-like cheese topping. This location provides a soup that is thick with far too much bread and cheese.  The service was like molasses. I had to flag down our server a few times, despite the fact that there were only ten or so tables occupied. There were at least three servers, so I'm not sure why it was so difficult getting service!  I wouldn't recommend this location but I still maintain that Papillon on the Park is fabulous!   And I probably won't visit this location again. It's a shame considering I really like the ambience and they have really good drink specials.  Merci."}
{"text":"Access It can be reached by foot, public transportation, or even by car. The location is central to all your needs and is a quick 20 minute walk from Eatons Centre. If you are looking at parking, you might find it easier to locate a Green P parking lot.  Service If you read all my notes from above, you would know that my expectations are lowered for both food and service. Much to my surprise the service was actually okay. Our waitress checked in with us after each dish and I was impressed by those who delivered our food. Almost all of them smiled and for a moment there, I felt welcomed. The place offers a casual atmosphere but unfortunately it is not that \"french-like\". My boyfriend thought it was really missing that special touch.  Food I could go into the details of each dish but let me give you the general scoop. Everything was fine, no surprises, no disappointment. For $25 it was worth it, no doubt. The problem is, my boyfriend would not come back.  Bread I wish they gave us better butter. There were only 4 slices of bread and thankfully they were easy to chew but...they didn't taste like much.  Chicken Pate This is the type of appetizer that you would find at a french restaurant. For those who don't know, you are spreading a layer of chicken liver pate (a mixture of meat that becomes a paste) on the croustini.  Filet of salmon (?) I don't remember what it was called but I swear it was stuffed salmon (though the site states otherwise). To begin, the sauce is awesome - in fact, it's the most important thing on this dish. The rice itself has enough flavours but there were a few grains of rice that were not fully cooked. I really liked the shrimps and mushrooms that one can find in the middle of that stuffed salmon - it had more taste than the salmon itself lols.  Duck Confit The veggies are the same as the previous but wow, I was impressed by the duck. It was not salty (that's key) and even without the sauce, it could have been fine. It's too bad that the duck portion was small but still satisfying.  Cheesecake This is your traditional cheesecake. Not too sweet and not too bland. I don't think this beats Cheesecake Factory in the states but I was glad they didn't screw up.  I believe this place could do better. I am almost 90% sure that we didn't order their signature dishes because really they weren't that \"French\" lols. I'm okay with coming back though my boyfriend disagrees. For a winterlicious menu, this is absolutely worth it. Many restaurants will reduce the portions AND quality. Our waitress was pretty funny, kept asking if we were full. One thing I did not like is how they suggested that the expected gratuity should lie between 18-20% because of their reduced prices. I prefer to make my own judgment on what the service is worth."}
{"text":"Their French Onion Soup was so delicious! Rich cheese covered on the top, a little bit overbaked, and some chunks are in the soup, with butter and onions, very tasty!  I had St. Laurent Crepe. The crepe itself was crispy, it had apple, bacon and cheddar inside and maple syrup on the side. The sweet-salty-flavor combination made the crepe taste special.  My friend had Beouf Bourgogne, it was more savory with beef inside. I like mine better.  The ambient was good, located in downtown but not that noisy. Like this place."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there this thrusday night. We were very apprehensive as we have seen very bad reviews, specialy concerning the Buytopia groupon. Well let me tell you, we are both French from FRANCE!!! And we were well impressed. Very warm and welcoming staff, who made the effort to speak a littel french to us. Great service, and the food....DELICIOUS!!!! the restaurant wasnt very busy but still great romantic atmosphere. We had the groupon for a 4 course plus wine. We got mussels as an extra to start with, mouth watering. Then we had the classic french salad with goats cheese, lots of it. Then the french onion soup delicious, followed by the duck for me and the boeuf bourgignion for him. Finished off with sorbet and warm caramel pudding we didnt finish as we were too full! The half bottle of white wine we had was perfect for me, fruity and not too dry. All in all great experience, gret food, great service, and great DEAL!!! As that meal should have cost 50$ each not 50$ for both!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5*  I wanted to grab a bite in St Lawrence Mkt but it was way too crowded inside and way too cold to sit outside...so i ventured to Le Papillon for a leisurely brunch  I got the steak frites, which came pre-sliced, which usually irks me coz i like cutting into my own steak, but this was done perfectly and the glaze was great, so i forgave them. The frites were pretty good, but i have to say, the fries @ Simple Bistro was way better. The beef though, was better here.   My server was a little odd and came back with a diff accent everytime he spoke to me. Not sure what that was about. (first time, it was nervous French, then when he asked me id i wanted dessert it was fake Brit. Weird)  Overall, good food for a sit-down place and not too pricey."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times now and each experience was magnifique. The dining area is surprisingly large with great brick walls and high ceilings, yet the feeling is intimate and cozy with the appropriate dim lighting. I love that they don't rush you here and let you truly enjoy each course.   Galette de St. Lawrence... Incroyable! This is a savory crepe served with apples, cheddar, bacon and a side pot of maple syrop. YUM! Great combination of flavours that makes your mouth do a happy dance.   If you're seeking a quasi-upscale date-night approved restaurant in the St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood, look no further..."}
{"text":"We had high hopes based on the simple bistro menu, the lovely ambience and the friendly service. But the food quality is mediocre and overpriced.  We ordered mussels and escargots to start and both were good, not remarkable.  The duck was ok, not very tender, flavour was a bit off. My steak frites had a charred flavour I couldn't shake, not melt in your mouth like the best examples of this dish.  The crepes dessert was the nail in the coffin for me. Crepes should be soft and a little spongey. This was crispy and tough. Really poorly executed.  We got the feeling that they have become lazy from a steady business of visiting tourists and its proximity to local attractions. As locals, we were hoping we would find a regular bistro we could visit regularly. This isn't the place."}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood so we stopped in for brunch. Nice, warm interior. Staff are professional, but not very attentive. When we had questions they knew their stuff but we had to work at getting their attention. The food was pretty good. We had the St. Laurent crepe and the Ouefs Galette. The crepe was delicious, kind of like apple pie in a crepe (ultimate comfort food!) although I thought an extra $2 for some maple syrup a bit much. The galette was also delicious, properly cooked so the eggs were not tough, and the home fries were also cooked so they had crunch but fluffy interiors. Not a place to come in a rush as they prepare things from scratch so food can take a while to arrive, but I would come again because it offers good value - the food is pretty good for the price you pay."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to check out this place for their Winterlicious menu.  The lunch menu was priced at $23 for a three course meal. The food turned out to be ok. We got one of each of the items on the menu so we could share and try all the dishes. But nothing was particularly amazing but it was kind of expected from the price.  The restaurant itself does have a nice vibe and lady who served us was very sweet."}
{"text":"I'm a very big fan of this place. I went for brunch with my friends here.  We chose it ona whim as we were walking by.  Nobody was outside to seat us and we wanted to be on the patio so I just sat my ass down and made a spot for us.  The LOVELY server came out and she was so incredibly nice as she gretted us.  Lovely smile and just had that type of personality that makes you smile.  Because we sort of just wandered in I still had my morning coffee in hand in my disposable cup.  My server was so lovely that she brought out a glass to transfer the coffee into (managers generally don't like you having your coffee cup in their restaurant...and i suppose it might be rude to take it in).  but she made a big deal to make sure I didn't have to throw it out and I could enjoy it with my brunch.  We ordered bennies and crepes at the table.  All of which were scrumptious.  They weren't amazing.  but they were good. The price is moderate.  at 15$ for the crepe and 13 for the benny it was alright.  Not amazing value but I'll take it given the location and the amazing service.  The inside has a beautiful decor with exposed brick.  I LOVE nice rooms.  Oh, and the VERY tempting dessert menu did not go unooticed but I felt it might be a little too early to get a creme brulee after brunch.  ( a good excuse to come back and enjoy dinner).  Oh, and I should say that the staff all speak french and every dish that came out of the kitchen seemed quite \"authentic\" and looked amazing!.  I highly reccommend this place with a small group or a date.  It will be an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"What a lovely brunch place.  Came here with my boyfriend's family and it was a bright place to have a relaxing Sunday brunch.  The food was delicious.  I had the Crepe Maritime, which was ooey gooey good with baby shrimps and bay scallos in white wine cream sauce.  It was a little bare and I could have used a little salad on the side but no matter.  My boyfriend had the ham and gruyere omelette, which was just the right amount of cheesiness with a side of frites.  The servers were attentive and very French.  Next time I am out with my lovely girls, I will definitely come here for a bit of French, tres bien!"}
{"text":"Very nice, best service I have seen in Toronto so far. Prices are a bit high, but you pay for the amazing quality, service, place, and decently large portions. Definitely make a reservation, sometimes maybe even 2 days ahead if possible. It is very comfortable, and doesn't feel too classy, even though it perhaps tries to be a little, but in a very modest and friendly manner."}
{"text":"I made reservations the same day on Sat night at 7pm through their website. The reservation system is called Rezbook and is similar to Opentable. We were greeted with a \"Bonjour\" which reminded me of high-school French classes. Our party of 2 was seated promptly. The chairs are comfortable, coat racks were pretty full so we just hung our jackets on the back of our chairs.  My date had purchased a Buytopia coupon for $49 for a $160 four course prixe-fixe. There isnt any choice for the 1st or 2nd course. Two glasses of house wine were included, we both chose the white wine which was good.  1st course was salad, it tasted great. Not much to complain about.  2nd course is their onion soup which was excellent. I am not typically fond of onion soup but it had a deep rich flavour.  3rd course for my main I chose the salmon and my wife had the duck confit. The portion was a bit small for the salmon but it tasted great. The lone broccoli piece was a bit hard. My wife said the duck was a bit dry and she would have wanted more of the tasty sauce.  4th course I had the apple crumble which was good. My wife had the caramel cake, it had a mushy texty but still good. Both came with one scoop of vanilla ice cream. The ambience and decor is nice. We were a bit close to the other tables. We got a bit hot in the place, but it could just be because the place was full. The table next to us complained their wine glasses smelled like bleach, the server (who was French by the way) got some new glasses. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm so sad I can't write a better review for this place..I've heard of it, it's been on my list of places to try and after finally making a reservation for brunch on Sunday morning with some girlfriends, I was sadly disappointed.   Aesthetically this place is beautiful. There's a small, cute patio out front and the interior is lovely.   Now, for the bad: the service was HORRIBLY SLOWI ordered grapefruit juice, coffee and had water and several times throughout the meal all glasses were empty...hydration wasn't a priority.   I had the eggs Benedict which I thought could have been much better. The hollandaise sauce was mediocre at best and the ham was...I'm assuming smoked, because that's all I could taste.   I'm not entirely set on writing this place off. I'd like to try their dinner. If I ever do return for brunch, I'm requesting a plate full of frites...because that was the best portion of the experience!"}
{"text":"Great meeting place for lunch or romantic dinner.  Great French food at a great location.   My favourite is the crepe St Laurent.   Enjoy, maybe this will become your go to place when in town for a visit.  Great decor."}
{"text":"went here with friends a couple weeks ago. nice menu classic french (maybe too many options) but the apps were good. Crepe fillings tasted like they might have been microwaved, but not bad flavour. My friend had the french onion soup and it smelled so good that i ordered one for myself. very very tasty. nice older quebecois man was our server Cant remember his name but he was amazing and very friendly."}
{"text":"PROS: -Delicious food! I had the St Laurent crepe (bacon+apples+cheddar). So yummy! The smoked meat crepe is great too.   -Excellent service & beautiful interior.   -Nice place for a date or light dinner.   CONS: -I think I'd be more impressed if the crepes were more visually appealing."}
{"text":"I had a yummy Reuben sandwich here with hand carved Montreal smoked meat.  It was sooo good and you can have it with frites or salad.  It was Friday so I had the deep fried yummy potatoes.  Our waiter was great and fun was had by all."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the ambiance works well.  The problem for me is the constant up selling of product by the wait staff.  I'm sure they are required to do this and I understand why, but it gets a bit annoying.  Came before a show at the Sony Center and they get you out promptly when they know your schedule."}
{"text":"Came here with couple of friends last week.  The place was quite empty on an early friday night but filled up pretty quickly.  I have been to le papillon on church street in the past and was quite surprised they moved to Front street.  This place is nicely decorated and service was good.  Between four of us we had four appetizers I think the mussels were quite good.  My onion soup was nothing spectacular.  My hubby liked his rib eye.  I have to say my bouillabaisse was quite bland.   Overall, we had a great time here (2 bottles of wine helped.)  The final bill was quite reasonable for four people including 4 apps/entree + 2 bottles of wine it was only around $200.     I would give 3.5 star for the food and 4 star for decor/service."}
{"text":"brunch was a disaster... ordered teo different styles of eggs benedict, very soso, and when asked fo goat cheese and spinach added to the meal, there was two leaves and goat cheese was on the side.... WTF??"}
{"text":"j'ai enfin trouver un restaurant à hauteur de mes esperences! je l'ai savouré mon filet mignon! La nourriture est très bonne, je me croyais vraiment en France le temps d'un repas! Déco typiquement France des années 30/40 très agréable, le service est à moitié francais, moitié anglais donc bien sympa!  Pour le prix bien sur on vous sert de la bouffe Française donc comptez environ 25$ pour un plat principal, 10$ pour un dessert, 10 pour une entrée et les cafés sont assez cher aussi!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed about my dining experience here. The first red flag was the bacteria infested rags they provided as napkins. Was like wiping my mouth with dirty socks and was totally nasty. Second red flag was when I ordered my veal medallions, they didn't bother to ask how I want my meat cooked. The meat came medium-well and was totally overcooked. The side potatoes were completely overcooked, but only warm on the inside. They must have been pre-cooked and reheated or sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The meat pie looks like they microwaved to heat up as the outside crust was soggy and not crisp. Pity as the inside meat filling was quite tasty. Not only was the food quality worse than what I would expect from a fast food joint, the portions were smaller than a typical tapas dish. Horrible quality food, small portions, and 5 star restaurant prices just don't add up. All this and they have the audacity to give a note with the bill suggesting a 15--18% tip. Clearly the management is the problem. Cutting costs hiring cheap untrained kitchen staff and chefs, not properly washing napkins, using subpar ingredients, reducing portions, and trying to get more tips by leaving a completely unwarranted tipping guide. If the customers have a pleasant dining experience, the tips will come naturally.   Unfortunate as our server was very pleasant and attentive. But that doesn't make up for all the other shortcomings of this restaurant. Never coming back again..."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends tonight and I gotta say, this restaurant was incredible. If I could give it 10 stars I would.  We came in for Winterlicious, ordered the salmon rillette, rainbow trout entree and key lime pie. Food was well cooked and nicely seasoned. Portions were the perfect size.   Atmosphere is very pleasant, not too loud, not too dark, temperature was comfortable (this is the old lady in me now ). Everyone was very friendly and attentive.   But where the extra 5 stars comes in is this: Some random guy was apparently hitting on my friend and oddly joined our group...and wouldn't leave. Won't go into details but guy was super creepy and we didn't know how to get rid of him. The staff noticed and quietly got rid of him without fuss or anyone noticing other than the table next to us. I was extremely impressed by their concern for our safety and well-being. There are just no words to describe how thankful I am that they knew exactly what to do in that situation.   In short, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a delicious meal and amazing staff. We will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night. Great ambience, good service and delicious food. We used a travelzoo deal to try this place out and we were still treated well and had great food options. Everything we ordered was fantastic : garden salad with tarragon dressing,  grilled shrimp, smoked duck, seared tuna, chocolate mousse and strawberry crepe. Highly recommend this place. Atmosphere lovely for date night but large enough to accommodate a group. We will be back."}
{"text":"Such positive experiences every time I've been here! Convenient location near the St. Lawrence Market and yummy food at pretty good value :) The venue is pretty spacious (I've personally never seen it at max capacity and always been able to come w/o a reservation, but there are always customers) and really charming and romantic... Great for date night or a more formal meet up with friends or family. I've been here for lunch before as well as twice for Winterlicious ('16 and '17) and I genuinely love the French-inspired dishes here! The presentation is thoughtful and the flavors are warm and welcoming, like the staff and interior :) Note: The -licious selections tend to be significantly smaller than regular menu equivalents, which tend to be pretty big unlike usual French portion sizes.   However, this year for Winterlicious '17 lunch I was a bit disappointed with the food quantity and presentations. I ordered the lentil salad to start, which was actually a bit sad since it was quite small and quite bland. My partner ordered the soup of the day, which was a vegetarian chickpea soup, which was pretty big and very delicious. Meals come with complimentary bread (ask for EVOO+BV!). For my main I ordered the salmon pave, which again was smaller and more barren-looking than I expected from Le Papillon, but I chose the soup of the day as accompaniment and that was delicious. My partner ordered the vegetarian crepe, which we both recommend since it was HUGE!! Although, I peeked inside the crepe and was surprised by how little filling there actually was. The desserts were great though! My partner ordered the NY style cheesecake, which can never go wrong, and I ordered the \"cherries jubilee served over French vanilla ice cream\", which consisted of a small, but delicious scoop of ice cream topped with canned/marinated (?) cherries.  Overall, great restaurant, but coming here for -licious dinner or regular menu options will probably get you the best experience."}
{"text":"I dislike having to write unfavourable reviews, but my wife & I were quite disappointed with our meals at Le Papillon on a recent Saturday evening.  First the good. Service was excellent in all respects. Maitre D & waiter were friendly, helpful & speedy. The room itself is also very nice.  Unfortunately, all of our food dishes except the French Onion Soup were sub-par.  My wife had the French Onion Soup & while she didn't love it, she did say it was acceptable. I tasted her soup & found it good, although I found the broth to be pretty rich, almost gravy-like. Regardless, the soup did taste pretty good.  I had the escargots for my appetizer & they were served lukewarm. Not being hot enough, ruined the dish for me. As well, the bread served at the table, which I used to sop-up the garlic butter, was not very good. A French restaurant needs to have good bread, not cheap commercial bread served with butter packets!  Four our main dishes, we both settled on crepes. My wife had the St. Laurent, Le Papillion's \"signature\" crepe. I had the De La Mer.  I did not taste my wife's crepe, but she did not enjoy it.  My seafood crepe was, to be honest, not at all good. The crepe itself was overcooked (as was my wife's). The scallops & shrimp in my crepe were the small, salad-sized ones- tasteless & rubbery. The tarragon sauce was very watery making the dish look soupy once I cut into the crepe & all the watery sauce ran out.  My wife & I both agree that we would never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for Summerlicious and had a decent to mediocre experience. The crepe saucisse I had was slightly overcooked but the dessert, Pouding Chomeur, was deliciously moist and not too sweet. However, having said that, I did not fully appreciate the signs that kept reminding us to tip. I've worked and dined in classy restaurants before and one is usually not pressured/reminded to tip. When I commented on this on Bookenda, the restaurant's reservation website, I got quite the snarky reply in return hence the 1 star rating. It would have been nicer to receive a more polite explanation instead of the passively aggressive one I felt that I got -- upon looking at other comments on the site, mine was the only one they replied to. Feels a bit targeted. They have ensured that myself and my friends won't be returning there. Find a better place in the city!"}
{"text":"First the good: The ambiance is very nice and the staff are pleasant.    But - we've eaten here a couple of times and it's very overpriced for the quality. $26 for a small piece of overdone salmon and a scoop of boring rice, come on now. At $160 per couple, I also expect my glass of wine not to smell of bleach.   Finally, the service to our table of 7 was also painfully slow.  It took an hour and a half to get our appetizers (and they were not busy).   With so many creative and well run restaurants to choose from in downtown Toronto, we won't be spending our money here again. It's too bad because the menu has some interesting choices you don't see often (such as crepes and tourtiere)."}
{"text":"New York steak comparable but not better than Baton Rouge in Vaughan. Their shrimp appetizer and salads are quite good.   Was here with colleagues from the office for year end Christmas lunch."}
{"text":"We had a meal on a Tuesday evening so restaurant was relatively quiet. Food was great - we left happy and looking forward to returning. Between the 6 of us, we shared and sampled each other dishes so we could give everything a try.  APP - Seafood appetizer duo - great sear on scallops and shrimps. Personally didn't care for the sauce but wasn't a bad dish. - Escargot - really great garlic sauce, simple dish done right. - Duck pate - ok, but not very creamy pate. But relatively healthy for us though, I suppose, compared to other pate.  MAINS - Rack of lamb - this was one of the specials and very well executed. Great sauce and well cooked to order. - Steak frites - great steak with frites. My husband enjoyed this. - Red snapper - another evening special. Pretty good. Not my pick.  - Seafood pasta - pretty healthy dish (not too greasy) but not much to write home about I think.  DESSERT Had profiteroles, 2 large profiteroles with ice cream drizzled with chocolate. Fresh pastry.   We had a super friendly hostess and well mannered server. Service was good, but it was a pretty quiet night."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday, the atmosphere was quite nice and surprisingly not as busy as I thought it would be (which is a good thing, I don't like noisy crowds) Complimentary bread was promptly served to us after we settled in. To start I had french onion soup which was delicious- there was a natural faint honey-like sweetness to the gyuyere chese. There was also cheese nestled at the bottom of the soup as well, and sweet gyuyere was balanced with the flavourful soup. I threw some pieces of the complimentary bread in to soak up the deliciousness. For my main, I ordered quiche and Oeufs Belle-helene (just eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon)(sharing with my friend).  The quiche was quite tasty- the crust was thin and flaky, the bacon, cheese and eggs complimented each other nicely, without overpowering one another. The fries that came with the quiche were good considering I usually don't like fries. They were soft and seasoned just right. The salad that accompanies the dish was a bit too wet for my liking.  The smoked salmon however, was disappointing. The smoked salmon had a rather strong fishy taste and wasn't fresh. It overpowered the other ingredients of the dish and I wasn't impressed with this item.  Overall I would say the food was a 3.5/5, the service was a 4/5 and the atmosphere was a 5/5."}
{"text":"Quite satisfying and service was a delight.  I'm a savory girl and love to eat complex savory flavours. Sweet is for the birds. Canard was not too tough and not at all too fatty. I liked this just as much as thier meat pie. This pie was a buttery crust stuffed with minced venison, chicken, and beef. All came with a side of crispy vegetables. Everything was well seasoned.  Best part of the meal was dessert. Yup. When a savory person loved the dessert, that meant that it was exceptionally complex flavored. The merenge was very light and melts in your mouth, but the most wonderful dessert was the warm cake a la mode.  I don't remember what they were all named on the menu as French is not the best language for me to remember in, but the service was very friendly and very attentative. He was proud of his suggestions when we told him that we very much enjoyed it. He will help you pick something out. Also, who doesn't love a short Philipino man with gelled up hair and tight fitting clothes who seems much bigger than the body God gave him. His personality was busting out."}
{"text":"Have had both brunch and dinner here.  Brunch was quite good and reasonably priced.  Restaurant was also fairly busy which gave it a bit of character.  Ambience inside is nice and the service was good.  When I came for dinner on a weekday night, it was absolutely dead.  All of the charm and character from brunch was replaced with a void of nothingness.  Food was okay, but not outstanding, and the service was a bit off.  Our server claimed she was a native French speaker at one point, despite the fact that she pronounced every single letter in \"Monsieur\" (MON-SEE-YUR) which, although I'm quite the Anglophone, was a bit weird.  Anyways, I'll give it a rating somewhere between meh and pretty good.  A better bet for brunch."}
{"text":"Didn't want to pay roaming charges in Canada so we were lost on what to eat because we couldn't Yelp! *gasp*  So we stumbled down Front Street and found Le Papillon.  It's such a large restaurant that when we walked in we were a little skeptical about the food because it seemed way too commercial and not very cozy.  Our fears melted away when we were greated with a warm smile and BREAD!  Nothing makes me happier than to to be greeted with bread and butter at a restaurant.  I love bread and butter, especially if it keeps flowing throughout the meal....  We ordered Camambert Frites with cranberry sauce which is their version of a fried cheese and it was yummy.  Light brown and crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside.  Dip into the cranberry sauce and you have a tasty treat before your meal.  They're tiny though, but perfect since we weren't looking to stuff ourselves.  For our main we shared the mussels in white wine sauce small as well, as both the Camambert and mussels came from their brunch appetizer menu.  The mussels were absolutely fantastic!!  The broth was rich and had a great lemony herb taste and the mussels were plump and gorgeous.  The food was great but the best part was the great service.  Our server kept our coffee cups full and kept the bread coming and she was sooo friendly and super sweet.  Will definitely go back when I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was here for drinks only so can't comment on the food. They have a very lovely patio and the servers were very nice. I didn't realize they close at 10 so at 10.30 I noticed he place was empty except for the server who was waiting for us. It was so nice of her not to kick us out (I know some places that do). I'll definitely be back and try their food next time"}
{"text":"This is a nice little French place on Front St.  I had the small French onion soup for an appetizer, crepe bourgingnon (sp?) for main course and profiteroles for dessert.  All were very good.  I like to try new wines and Harry of Pelham Chardonnay was nice.  It's an Ontario (Niagara) wine.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"My GF and I had dinner here before a concert at the Sony Centre.  Nice ambience, small patio on Front Street, we ate inside.  I had a nice Shiraz, she had a sparkling rose. For appetizers we got the cheese board and the tiger shrimp. Main courses were the asparagus crepe and tourtière.  The food was great, really enjoyed our meal.  The bill for the 2 of us came to about $120 before tip, around what I expected.  I would def go there again.  Nice neighbourhood, not far from the St Lawrence market, Harbourfront, ACC, etc."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian plate, it was described as having asparagus, gruyere cheese and rice, amoung other things. It had none of those things, but it had goat cheese baked throughout, which the menu did not mention. I sent it back, I dislike goat cheese. They brought me another, it still had no gruyere that I could tell. (or rice or asparagus)  You'd think if they didn't have the ingrediants they would simply have told me. The taste was quite poor, just a jumble of vegetables thrown together. My wife had an indifferent spinach florentine crepe. Way too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointing. The French onion soup was very salty we couldn't finish more than a quarter of it. The duck was also quite dry and the side dishes were cold. Our waiter never checked up on us and didn't even notice the large platefuls that we were sending away. The only good thing was the atmosphere and the sorbet at the end.  For an authentic French restaurant, I've had much better and much more reasonably priced elsewhere.  However I bring the star up to three because Sean from the restaurant took the time to leave me a msg. And that goes quite a long ways :)"}
{"text":"Service was A- attentive but I really don't need my wine glass topped up every three minutes  We had the three course prix fix appetizers were nice the French onion soup is great My wife had the gravlax wrapped crab salad also very tasty My cassoullet although tasty was very dry. dessert was oeufs a la neige absolutely fantastic 35$ per person and 32$ for a bottle of riesling"}
{"text":"So because the two partners that started Le Papillon have gone on to make their own versions of Le Papillon, this place moved.  Thankfully, not far.  It used to be nestled in a small row of restaurants on lower Church Street at the Esplanade and now finds itself around the corner on Front Street, having taken over the place that once housed the Japanese restaurant Izakaya.  It's swapped sushi for French-Canadian cuisine.  Despite the addition of fairly traditional Canadian accessories and accents, there still is a bit of a Japanese feel to the restaurant.  The bar placed in the centre of the restaurant has not moved since the transition and looks to be the same as that found at Izakaya.  The menu remains the same delicious fare from the original location.  Well, mostly.  Since the move it looks like my favourite crepe (spinach and bacon) did not make the journey.  I was totally gutted to see it missing, but it gave me the opportunity to try the Tourtière pie I've been meaning to have for ages.  You know how it is, take away your favourite and you're forced to try new things.  Even though the crêpes are fantastic, the meat pie does not fail.  But that doesn't change the fact that I miss my favourite dish."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday evening and was warmly welcomed by staff. Friendly and knowledgeable. Food was delicious but deserts were amazing."}
{"text":"The perfect breakfast/brunch/lunch location.  Fun staff, excellent service, fair prices, and the food exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I was really not wanting to write this review. I didn't want to, but the experience I experienced here recently compared to a few years ago was dreadful. I took my partner here for her birthday, and we were beyond excited as I had my 19th birthday years ago and I enjoyed my meal. So we ordered three appetizers and a main. Below are their descriptions and our experience with them \"Scallops -pan-seared scallops, crispy risotto cake with a truffle oil cream sauce\" There was no sear at all, it was honestly like they threw them in the microwave and sent them to our table. The \"crispy\" risotto cake was anything but crispy, when it came out it was soggy and flavourless, like the scallops and when we turned it over the bottom wasn't even cooked and fried. We didn't even attempt to eat this mess. \"Brie Crémaux - breaded brie cheese, candied onion raspberry cranberry concasse\" The brie came out warm as well which we didn't understand as we were truly the only ones in the restaurant minus a few people only drinking beers on the patio.  \"Crevettes -Grilled Tiger Shrimps, grilled pineapple, honey-pineapple coriander sauce, chili flakes\" This was the only one my partner actually enjoyed, which was pretty upsetting when you think of it, we ordered four dishes and of all of them, she enjoyed 6 shrimp and a piece of pineapple. \"Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon -two 4oz. bacon wrapped tenderloins, black peppercorn dijon mustard sauce, potatoes & market vegetables\" This wasn't that bad, the bacon wasn't crispy at all and the sauce was actually insanely salty, I'm from Newfoundland, we eat salt and this salt was pretty overwhelming even for me.  Overall the let down was very real. We drove in 2 hour traffic for a meal that was quite frankly, lacking in every way. It's not a cheap place to go, so if you're looking for better food that's worth your money... don't come here."}
{"text":"When in France, eat french toast. That's what I say. And really? It just makes sense. If they didn't make good french toast, why would they stake their nationality on it?  The french toast is deeeelicious at Le Papilion, a great French place that I've only visited for brunch. It's not too fancy, but clean, friendly and I can read things on the menu (I appreciate that, thank you).   Run! Go! Eat some eggy-bread goodness!"}
{"text":"I can not tell you how much I loved my meal here. I had the Beef Bourguignon crape. It wasto die for. I left with an actual food high. I floated over to the Brickworks to walk it off. It has a lovely atmosphere and staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this restaurant for 20 years now. The new location on Front St is warm and stylish with lots of character. Service was friendly, restaurant was moderately busy. Our apps and dinner was good! We had the the onion soup, caesar salad, steak with fries and salmon.   Thank you for the nice evening. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Taste: 4, Service: 5, Value: 4, Presentation: 5 Overall: 4.5 rounded up to 5  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Trying out their poutine and their french onion soup today. I don't know of many places that have french onion soup so I am very excited!  The poutine fries were nicely crisped, with melted cheese and french onion soup sprinkled on top. The french onion soup really made this appetizer utterly addicting. The fries near the end will be a bit soggy though which is to be expected so got to eat this fast unless you don't mind soggy fries. The french onion soup was also really good, reminiscent of the delicious soup I had in Paris, except that the cheese on the top of this soup was slightly too burnt which is my only complaint. The salad on the side is plain salad so not much to expect.  I would say this is more on the fancier side of restaurants, we even ordered some wine to complement our meal. They had us test the wine before ordering it and such. Fancy!   I actually regret ordering both an appetizer and main. The poutine was so filling I barely made a dent in my french onion soup. Next time, I need to remind myself to only get one haha. Considering the amount and quality of the food for the price, I would rate them a bit better than average.  There aren't many places in Toronto that I know of that serve french onion soup and I will be sure to come back when I am craving it. That's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Love the old lighting fixtures and the brick walls with all the candles at decorations. Loved it."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service was TERRIBLE. My husband and I waited 40 minutes for our food. The waiter never came back to fill our coffees and when we tried to complain, we could not get his or the manager's attention. When he finally did approach us, he told us the delay was because he had a larger table that he had to serve. I pointed out to him that other tables around us (tables ranging from 1 person to 6 people) that came in after us got their food quickly while we were still waiting. He apologized again and told us it would take another 10 minutes!!   When we finally did get our food, he never checked back with us regarding the quality. I had to wave down another waiter to get the bill.   When we left the restaurant, I cornered the manager and told him about the lousy service. He gave the same response - \"large tables\"  - but then quickly said that was not an appropriate reason. He said it was unfortunate that we already paid otherwise he could have done something with our bill.   Seriously guys - have you never heard of a credit note? And I've been in the service industry long enough to know when a waiter has forgotten to send an order in. Just 'fess up that you made a mistake and that your attention was spent on the larger table because you thought you could get a better tip off them. You guys are doing a disservice to the great kitchen staff."}
{"text":"This place was simply not good. I dined here early on a Sunday night around 6:00pm. Though the place was not busy the frantic server made me feel far from relaxed. I also noticed him running his hands through his hair; not very appetizing.   The French onion soup was good. The broth was thick almost like a gravy. The gazpacho had a good spicy flavor but was not a proper gazpacho. (Not what you'd expect to find in Spain)   I would not be surprised if the tourtier I ordered was made out of house and reheated for my order. The beef of a beef ragout crepe was not tender.   I wanted to think Le Papillon was decent but the longer the night went on the more I did not like what I had to eat."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Le Papillon in years and was and drawn to their patio on Front St. The brunch menu was mediocre, delicate (as in small serving size) dishes and wasn't cheap, $30/head inc. tax and tip. I've had better and won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my meal at Le Papillon!  I was traveling on business and went downtown for dinner and stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the taste was amazing.  I rarely find good beef in California and it's a special delight when I find a great steak.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.  The atmosphere is great and the service was exceptional.  I left my glasses and Sandy arranged to get them back to me.  Great customer service!  I highly recommend this restaurant and plan to visit again."}
{"text":"Met up with a pal for lunch on a Saturday afternoon during Winterlicious. We arrived at 11:45 and it was not too busy; however, as we left at 2:30, most tables were occupied. Reservations may be a good idea; you can make online reservations, which is always a plus in my books. I love the decor; wooden floors and high ceilings were quite nice. Service was quite good as I felt that we were well taken care of during our time at Le Papillon. At 2:30 though, our server kept hitting us to leave (a little annoying). Now to the food. As mentioned, we ordered from the `licious menu where we had a number of items to choose from. To start, I ordered the soup of the day (artichoke and ginger pure) - pretty good especially for a super cold January day. As my main, I ordered the savory crepe - spinach, mushrooms, and cheese. The crepe was packed with these ingredients; I can only suggest to put less cheese in the crepe because at times it was overpowering everything. Lastly, I had the Brownie - you can easily skip this as it was nothing special.  Good for: French inspired cuisine, crêpe, brunch"}
{"text":"LOVED the service. Me and my friend were in a rush and the server was very accommodating. I ordered the florentine and it was delicious. Will definitely come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"On Front street, close to St. Lawrence Market. There's a very nice cafe to stop in and get a bite to eat. Husband enjoyed his breakfast while I had the Peameal bacon sandwich. Think cut of meat, well prepared and pleasing to look at as well. The meat was tender and juicy. Enjoyed enough to go back again. on"}
{"text":"One of those places that has survived solely because of its convenient location. I ended up trying this place out because it's close to my condo and one of the few places open for dinner on a Sunday. I wish I hadn't. Service was slooow... It took forever just to order and then they brought our soups first, before realizing they hadn't brought drinks yet.   I had the gazpacho andaluz which was actually decent and refreshing. But the chicken crepe was dry and flavourless. The crepe was thick and doughy and definitely not made fresh. My friend's fish did not look all that impressive either.   The wait staff speak fluent French, but other than that, I can't think of anything good to say about this place which is best avoided."}
{"text":"If you feel like paying a lot of money to seem super awesome to that date of yours, then go here.  But - honestly - the food's not that great, the portions range from small to adequate, and they nickel and dime you for everything.  You're trying to be a fancy place?  Don't charge people an extra two bucks for maple syrup on their crepe.  That's just ridiculous.  It's as embarrassing as hotels that charge for WiFi."}
{"text":"Excellent repas et service très sympathique ! Le tartare succulent, la soupe du jour merveilleuse, les crepes vraiment copieuses. Un seul bémol : la mousse au chocolat très bonne mais serait mieux avec du chocolat noir. Emplacement idéal pour un lunch."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2016 - food was delicious :) One of Toronto's oldest restaurants I was told. Had the choice to upgrade to their classic french onion soup (which did not disappoint) for a starter, the mushroom medallions for my entree, and the pouding chomeur for dessert - didn't go wrong with these choices."}
{"text":"Great tasting lamb shank summerlicious dinner. Smoked salmon appetizer wonderful too. Only complaint was the lack of rhubarb in the rhubarb apple crumble. Impeccable service from our honest east coast waitress! A local favourite!"}
{"text":"To start, the staff is amazingly friendly. The overall atmosphere is very relaxed and the decor is cool. Do not bother coming here for a quick in and out. The place resonates with 'come have dinner and chill'.   I strongly recommend you try one of their soups, they are absolutely 100% taste bud satisfying. I most recently had their asparagus crab soup; wow.   There is a lot of delicious choices on the main menu so, if you feel overwhelmed by the taste bud orgasm potential, go with the daily special; it is always a win.   Lastly, but most importantly, you must have dessert. You have to. If you're a person who does not typically have room for dessert after dinner, then starting with the dessert is non negotiable. Their apple-crumble-French-vanilla dessert is what your taste buds dream about at night. Why not reward them?"}
{"text":"We came here for summerlicious. We ordered the soup and smoked salmon for appetizer, snapper for main dish and crepe for dessert.  The service is good, however the food is bad. The snapper is the worst fish dish I've ever had, super dry and not much flavour. The dessert is hard to eat as well. Very disappointing and won't come back. This is the worst French food that I have had in French restaurant."}
{"text":"Carte limite, cuisine basique, sans vraiment de goût. Personnel très sympathique et cadre agreable, service rapide. Dommage que ce ne soit pas plus gastronomique."}
{"text":"It's a cozy little place right on Front street. Menu is reasonably priced and ambiance is quaint. I always find the best way to rate a French Restaurant is to try their French Onion soup. I found their soup to be liquids and cheese to be right out of a box. Food is as French as Taco Bell is Mexican."}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Thursday! The restaurant is huge but barely 20% filled! Got a Buytopia to try it out! It came with 2 glasses of wine, a salad to share, 2 Frencj Onion Soup, 2 main dish & 2 dessert! All for $49! The salad was reg mixed salad! They were tinsy bit frugal in the egg, gave us a sliver of hard boiled egg between 2 person as did 1 asparagus! The soup however was delish! Unlike the French version which is way too salty! This was one of the best French Onion soup ever! Both of us had the Duck Confit which I thought was superb! Very crisp skin no duck fat visually present! I hate it when I can see the fatty bits of the duck! One complaint was the mash potato tasted not that fresh! As if it's been made a week before! The fresh beans was nice and crisp! The dessert was a tad bit weak coz it didn't feature their specialty only apple crumb and some sort of caramel cake!  Overall delicious, will definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice cozy romantic French meal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Papillon in a former location back in 2007 while in Toronto to see RUSH play at Maple Leaf Stadium (twice in three nights). We had a very pleasant meal and I wanted to honor that since my wife couldn't come along this time. The new location is well placed and entirely walkable from anywhere downtown. Plenty of taxis if you prefer car. I started with the steak tartare and a lightly buttery California Chardonnay which was a good pairing. The bread, a sort of baguette crostini, served with the tartare, however, was stale and not really toasted. More like day or two old bread that was warmed for thirty seconds under a warming lamp. The tartare was good, not special. I figured I'd see how large the tartare was before deciding what else to order. I definitely could not go with a full entree, and the crepe menu is attractive. I got the bacon, apple, cheddar crepe and it was quite large, figure most of a dinner plate.  Still, it was good and I managed it all with some effort. Ha!!  No dessert after that of course. Wait staff were quite nice and I'd like to go with four stars but can't get over that bump because there just is no fine dining aspect to this place, it's sort of a solid middle-of-the-road restaurant considering it is French food. I would return if I were hungry and without a reservation at one of the finer French places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This review is for the dessert, only.  A friend of mine had been hyping the Chomeur (a french bread pudding) to me for quite sometime. She's due to have a baby any day, and a last Chomeur was on her bucket list, so me and some other friends joined her for dessert there.   The bread pudding was indeed delicious, and came in a hearty enough portion that you could feasibly share if you'd had a big dinner. It's also quite sweet, and so just a few good bites might be enough. One of us had the sugar pie, and he plowed through the whole thing like a champ, though it looked like the most decadent pie on the planet. Basically stuffed full of gooey brown sugar. Needless to say, I've added that to my dessert bucket list for sure.  The restaurant itself is spacious and lovely, and the servers and host were very attentive. I'd definitely go back for dessert, and I've heard they make some great martinis, too."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious and found it to be of great value. They're in the $25 dinner range but the quality and service is above average. The portions are also pretty big - I left the restaurant stuffed.   I would recommend going for the soup of the day because the other 2 appetizer choices are less than impressive. They served a sweet potato and apple soup on the day I went - I wish the soup was served a little warmer but it was still acceptable. Unfortunately I didn't taste much sweet potato, and the \"apple\" portion was definitely apple sauce. The soup was good, but for sure there's room for improvement. You can also upgrade to the French onion soup for $4.   The lamb shank and duck confit were great mains! I was surprised at how tender and soft the meats were. Only drawback is that I wish there was more sauce to accompany the meat and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Very expensive, over-priced.  Quality is boring.  The soda, no refills, and the one you get is barely filled.  When I asked for a refill, which I had to walk up to the bar since the waitress ignored the empty glass.  The guy said, no refills.  Ok.  Irritating.  The crepes suck too, spinach and salmon, no cheese or any seasoning to give it any flavor, we could have made it at home.  The fish and chips were something I could order anywhere.  There is nothing unique or exciting about this place, but it is a tourist trap so beware!    Do not recommend coming here, ever!"}
{"text":"An impromptu jaunt in the area landed us here for some really good French food.   The dim lighting, brick-face walls and classic French details of the interior's aesthetic combined with some cuteso accordion music playing set the stage perfectly for a romantic dinner.    Food:  The crab-stuffed smoked salmon (we shared to start) was very good.    I ordered the seafood crepe, which had a delicious white sauce inside.  Boyfrond got a cheese and spinach crepe, which offered a big contrast to my own but was flavorful in its own right.    The service was really attentive--the host has a great personality.  A solid choice for not-exorbitantly priced French food."}
{"text":"When you're visiting from the states, you don't want all the foods you can try back home.     This place is hard core french canadian quebecian.    Had this meat pie thingie (never had something like this before.   Had this caramel like pie (tarte au sucre... another item I've never had before).   All in all, I wish I had more time to try out the rest of the quebecian food."}
{"text":"Not realising this restaurant had moved we went to it's old location, luckily the new address was quite close by :) The service was prompt and friendly. The outside patio was a bonus; it faces Front Street so it is a tad busy but not bad by city standards. The escargots were YUM, the \"De La Mer\" crepe was tasty, but my crepe the \"Jean-Pierre\" was unremarkable; it was kinda dry and bland truth be told.  Unfortunately we didn't have time for dessert, nor did I have a chance to scope their washrooms, but this place earns 4 stars for an overall good dining experience, well, maybe more like 3.5."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor with very attentive staff. Surprisingly large portion as not typical for French restaurants. We had  beef bourguignon and crepe of the day and two soups - all very tasty. I might call it tourist French as I didn't see fancy French sauces or complicated dishes"}
{"text":"Came here for summerllicious lunch overall the food was subpar, presentation was lacking and the flavour was lacklustre.  Started with asparagus wrapped in prosciutto with side lettuce the only good thing was the prosciutto.  There was barely any balsamic glaze for flavour.  Next was the short ribs with frites the meat was full of fat and was missing sauce and overall flavour the frites were the only good part of the main.  Desert was a crepe a crepe with orange sauce.  I expected a rolled up crepe instead it was a flat pizza shaped shape crepe that was saturated with orange flavour very disappointed overall.  Our waitress never asked us once if we needed anything or how our meal was.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Everything I ordered turned out great. The escargot was great as expected. Just the right amount of flavour and they use a nice cream-based sauce. The salmon fillet and the cheesecake were pretty good too in their own right. The only part of the meal I didn't like was the hard bread at the beginning at the meal, but hey that was free. Best of all though, they have blanche de chambly beer, which is very hard to find and is one of the best beers in the world (don't believe me? Google it!) The waiter was a bit snooty though, almost like a character out of Ratatouille."}
{"text":".The food was decent . The ambiance is good but  with dim lighting ... My group came for Winterlicious and while we liked what we ate  it was not as spectacular as we hoped. The Duck Confit was supposed to  have a port wine pomegranate sauce, sadly it was just a port wine sauce with pomegranates sprinkled on it.  What myself and my group disliked was the request on the menu for  an 18-20% gratuity  which is not nice( see pictures posted with my review). We will tip  based on the  quality of  our experience,  food and service.  Overall its a good place   if you want to hang out with friends and just want comfort food then check it out.  For those who are particular, there are  many other  better options at the same price  as well as lower ."}
{"text":"Charming medium sized French restaurant.  The menu is a little small but has all the standards you would expect with some Quebecois items for flair.  The food is very good and well priced for upscale food in this area."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, but the food isn't good. Had the soup of the day (broccoli purée), which was certainly no purée -- very oily and thin. The server did make an effort to make it right, offering a salad to replace it, which was much appreciated! Club sandwich had overcooked chicken and burnt bacon. Cafe au lait was very good though!"}
{"text":"I give Le Papillon a 3.5.    This was the first time I had visited the new (must be old by now!) Le Papillon on Front Street.  It is a big space with really nice decor, and staff are endlessly friendly.  It looked like it was great for groups.  Prices are also pretty decent - mains are in the high teens and mid 20s, and you can easily pass off most of the appetizers as meals.  However, the food is not bad, but also not great.    I can recall they used to promote themselves as a Quebecois restaurant, which was great because it was one of the few places that I could get some cretons in the city (one of my guilty pleasures!).  I ordered some mussels and fries - they were not bad, but not great either.  With the fries some were super crispy, others were quite soggy.  The white wine sauce that the mussels were in seemed a bit flat and the garlic didn't seem as though it was sauteed beforehand.  It just seemed like not a lot of care was put into the food.  The rilettes that we got as an appetizer were also sloppily proportioned.    Oh Le Papillon you could do so much better!  Don't rest on your laurels in your location by the St. Lawrence Market, improve on your food and keep your service great."}
{"text":"This is the breakfast place I was looking for in Toronto. Close to home, not too pricey, and exquisite.  It exceeds my expectations. The staff were very friendly and genuinely smiled. I enjoyed the mussel appetizers a lot. And I just love fries. Lovely decor and music."}
{"text":"Went here during Winterlicious 2015 and the dinner was very good.  The restaurant is more private and quiet with lower lighting, which is great for a romantic date.  The only thing was that the walls inside the restaurant are brick which gave it a bit of a bar feel.  The waiter was friendly, patient and gave recommendations.  We ordered the escargot and the chicken liver pate.  The waiter did not recommend the pate, but I insisted.  The escargot was really good covered in a creamy sauce.  We didn't like the pate however this was my first time having pate so I can't judge.  Our main courses were superb, we had the braised lamb and the duck confit.  Both of them were tender and well flavored.  The sides were cooked well too.  They were so delicious!  For desert we had the cheesecake and the chocolate brownie which were ok.  The experience was great!   If your in the mood for a French cuisine I recommend this restaurant.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"This review for 2018 winterlicious menu. What I recommend to order: salmon for starter, veal for main, pecan pie for dessert Service: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Dessert: 1/5 Reservation Needed: probably not Value worth for winterlicious: average, you get what you pay for, not a good deal though  I came here with my family. I made a reservation in advance; however, this place looks pretty empty that I don't think a reservation would be needed. So we tried out winterlicous menu here. Starter: we all ordered salmon for the starter. The dish came with 2 pieces of bread, a little bowl of salmon and a very small salad. You spread salmon on the bread. The taste is pretty good. Main: we ordered chicken and veal. The Veal Roulade only has 3 pieces. Both dishes have mashed potatoes and boiled veggie. The portion is good. I like the taste of veal. For chicken, it tastes a bit dry. Dessert: we actually order all 3 desserts here. White and Dark chocolate mousse is extremely sweet, I could not finish my dish. Key Lime Pie is extremely sour as well, which my mother could finish either. They don't have Double Chocolate Pecan Pie, but Pecan Pie, which tastes somewhat sweet as well. However, this dish is the best tasting one.  Overall, I think this winterlicious experience is pretty average. I do not think I get a good winterlicious deal."}
{"text":"Will not be back, had the Pave of Salmon with a side of fries for 21.00 .  Salmon was a tad overcooked and the portion not worth the 21 dls."}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance and service.  Meat pie didn't disappoint, but the eggs Benedict were cold and the salad was mushy and overdressed."}
