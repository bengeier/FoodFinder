{"text":"Great Market the food is delicious and its very clean inside and out The staff are very Friendly I must say!! Although it is a little bit pricey!! But hey its a upscale market."}
{"text":"The Sunterra concept is great, and this location is ideal for me since there's not much selection on the east side of downtown.

Whether I dine in or take back to the office, I can always expect a great meal. The salad bar is awesome, there's always an abundance of samples at each counter, and TONS of selection (however, if you frequent Sunterra enough, their food can get mundane).

One suggestion I'd have is food allergy indicators or options. When I go upstairs to dine in, sometimes there's nothing available for me (gluten and dairy free).

I've also tried one of their cooking classes. At $50/pp that's a great deal. The instructor was amazing, and we were split into groups, each cooked a meal, and then tasted everything at the end."}
{"text":"If you're not knowing, I'm here to let you know, that there's a dramatically better chocolate milk available at Sunterra that you won't find in your local grocers dairy case. It comes in a frosty glass bottle, it's made in Sicamous, BC by \"D\" Dutchmen Dairy, and it tastes like drinking melted chocolate ice cream. It's \"out of this world\" good. Moreover, they carry a brand of yogurt called Island Farms from Victoria, BC which tastes as good as yogurt could taste, yet rarely does. It's smooth and sweet and silky. In fact, it tastes down right decadent. 
Oh yeah, and they have other stuff too, I'm told! They have a large deli counter, bakery, produce, and a wide selection of already prepared foods available. They also have a sit-in cafe on site if you want to get a bite pre-shop."}
{"text":"Lisa had garlic fettuccine and I had the guinness bison burger. My burger was a bit dry and I had to put some ketchup on it. Lisa's pasta was warm and had a healthy amount of garlic, it was very comforting. 
The burger was10.99
The pasta was 12.99 plus 4.00 for shrimp 
All in all it was OK."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always have a great experience stopping in here for a sandwich or one of their pre-made items from the deli. The BBQ chicken wrap and a small tray of mixed vegetables are my go-to (forgot to pack a lunch) lunch favourite. 

They have a bakery, a salad bar, and a restaurant. So much variety. There is something for everyone. I love whole foods and this is about as close to that as you can get in Calgary."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant upstairs. We had a selection of appetizers; flatbread and bacon wrapped prawns and more. All were fantastic.  A couple people in our party ordered meals, both looked quite good and very generous portions.  Seems like a great place to join some friends after work for drinks and appies.  A little quieter, a little out of the way if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I regularly go to this Sunterra for lunch and to pick up food to eat back at the office. Generally, I am very impressed, with some exceptions. Here are some thoughts:

- the prepared food is fresh BUT check the expiry dates on any pre-packaged dips, desserts, baked goods, etc. I had a few instances of expired food. The pastries especially have a tendency to be old, to the point of being inedible. I got a free slice of cake on my birthday (by being signed up to the Sunterra points program), and I selected one of the mousse desserts. The mousse had shrunk from being dried out and tasted gummy and disguisting. I could not eat it.

- The upstairs level consists of cafeteria-style \"stations\" where you can order items such as pasta, pizza, soup, crepes, and other entrees. There is also a sit-down restaurant.  I like the food upstairs, but the ordering system is chaotic. There are multiple lines leading to the various stations and cash registers, and you are not sure who is waiting to order, pay, and/or pick up their food. When they first opened, they even had to have employees explaining to customers how the system is supposed to work.. I've never seen the need for this at any cafeteria, deli, or restaurant. They should have a number system. I avoid this area during the lunch hour.

- My favourite items are the fresh squeezed juices and the bagels, and the yogurt with fruit and granola. The salad bar is nice as well, with lots of unique topping options. It does get messy, with the topping bins getting \"cross contaminated\" by the time the lunch hour is over.

- I find the prices to be quite good for lunch. Sandwiches are $5 (more if you're getting it on a wrap or baguette), paninis are around $6, soups are around $4. You can get a decent salad from the salad bar for $5-6. The entrees upstairs are more pricey ($6-7 and up), but generally you can eat for under $10,  comparable to what you would pay for fast food.

- The supermarket prices are higher than your average supermarket, but they carry more upscale and smaller brands that are not commonly found. The produce is great, and they often have heirloom or local fruits and veggies. I would not purchase all my groceries there unless I lived nearby, but it's great if I need to pick up a couple of ingredients for dinner or to make lunch back at my office.

- There are a lot of samples throughout the store, especially if you are there around lunchtime."}
{"text":"Sunterra West Market is amazing.  The staff are really great and most have been there for a long time.  Makes coming back easy and friendly.  Excellent variety in the grocery section for unique items such as spices and imported goods.  Breakfast/lunch cafe is an amazing value -- can't beat the quality and not expensive at all.  Dale the barrista is a long time staffer and has many regulars who come to see him.  Love Sunterra!!"}
{"text":"Validated parking, super fun groceries and great food. We had dessert and coffee as an after supper/before movie treat. It tasted wonderful and I can't wait to go back for a meal or cooking lessons."}
{"text":"Reasonable pricing, great food, horrible service.  You have 2 order twice.  The layout sucks.  They usually forget about what you ordered.  Doesn't compliment the rest of Sunterra.  I'm a huge Sunterra fan but Market Bar is not good."}
{"text":"Loves Sunterra. Come home after some high-intensity training and it is only steps from my door. Order some quick tasty grub and in minutes I am out the door and my wallet is not much leaner then when I stepped inside. Try the chickpea salad. Mmm. Good.

Get in here and get some good food quick and easy. 

Yelp yelp and away."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this location, their bread and bakery items are to die for, some of the staff can be as snobby as the people that live in this affluent neighborhood.  If you don't have a Sunterra card number, you might as well live in a box behind the building."}
{"text":"Quality meats but everything else is over priced and mostly the same items you can get at a normal grocery store.

If you are shopping at the Britannia Maket, don't! Ask to see the backroom if you aren't sure...nasty to say the least! If that doesn't do it for you, ask the manager about the mouse problem! So gross."}
{"text":"Sunterra, I love your amazing salad bar. There's like every ingredient on the planet!!! I love the chocolate muffins, I LOVE the caramel bars. OH MY. I love the drinks selection too. Lots of healthy options. I love the points system.  

What I wish Sunterra would do better is season some of their food! Just add salt, pepper and perhaps some herbs or spices to the chicken or salmon before putting it in the salads, please! It's always so bland. Same goes for the salad rolls. No seasoning. It has been like this for years. Ho hum."}
{"text":"I went upstairs to have a sit down lunch, and was super impressed. The selection and quality of food is top-notch. The idea is you look at all the stations and then decide what you want to order. Place the order, pay, and then pick it up. Available for take out and eat in. Great selection of coffee beverages, and snacks as well."}
{"text":"Had the greatest experience at lunch yesterday at the Sunterra Market Bar - Keynote. The daily specials didn't sound gluten-free, so one of the cashiers said she'd get the chef to talk to me. All I expected him to do was point me in the direction of some options. Instead, the chef, Michael P., asked me what I wanted and said he'd whip it up - made to order! Seriously! What incredible service. I told him no seafood, no gluten, but otherwise...it was up to him.

He prepared a great coconut chicken curry and served it on spinach for me, and then personally delivered it to my table. There were mounds of  fresh veggies, cooked perfectly, and the serving was huge. I loved that he thought to serve it on spinach! As a celiac, whoa, am I ever sick of rice with everything!

At Sunterra, you pay when you order your food, but since mine was being made and didn't have a price attached to it, I asked the chef how to pay before I sat down at my table...he said not to - it was on him! Seriously. Incredible service."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for their upstairs Carve and Big Bowl casual dining area as a place to get good food fast.  It's generally OK during the busy lunch hour - although it can be slow.  Crepes are good but not much to it for the price. Pizzas are only ok - maybe a bit small. Big bowl and pastas are hit or miss. The daily special from the carve station can be good value. BUT - If you find yourself wanting one of their burgers or chicken club sandwiches during times other than a workday lunch (i.e., dinner) then prepared to be disappointed - as I have been more than a handful of occasions - not sure why I keep trying hoping it won't be. They used to cook the patties and breasts to order but for some reason changed in the last year. You will get a re-warmed/precooked hamburger patty or chicken breast that resembles either a hockey puck or piece of leather. Hard, tough, burnt. The sit-down order off the menu restaurant portion is good (that gives it one more star) for a quick bite. As for the rest of the market - sandwiches are expensive except for the paninis which are good and of course everything else is overpriced as mentioned in other reviews."}
{"text":"I have never been to Sunterra, since I was at a nearby business I decided to check it out.  This place is quite big.  They had the most beautiful bouquets right near the door so there was a pleasant sent in the air.  After I passed the bouquets there was the smell of the near by cafe and dinning area.  

The deli has a good selection of meats, but I was impressed by the selection of cheeses, there was everything you could imagine!  They also had a well stocked bulk selection of olives.  I browsed the shelves and was taken back by the choices of sauces they had, there were numerous hot sauces, was was called \"colon cleaner\"!  I found an organic black bean sauce I thought I would try, it was $7 for a medium sized jar (it didn't turn out to be that good, which was a disappointment).  I found the everyday, name brand items cost the same as other grocery stores.  The organic options they carry seemed to be a bit more pricey.  I found some organic corn chips for $3 I decided to try.  Their produce was all in good shape and well stocked, again the prices were comparable.  I bought some strawberries, which were huge and turned out to be delicious.  

Their bakery is another story.  They have fresh bagels for 80 cents each.  There were pies for $10, I decided to get a apple one.  There were about 5 choices of cheesecake, an individual piece cost only $3!  There was a great selection of buns and breads.   The lady at the til was very nice, she asked if I had a Sunterra number, I didn't, so she gave me the form to fill out.  

I decided to grab a drink at their cafe.  The restaurant area was super busy, which must be a sign that the food here is at least decent.  The guy working at the cafe was really bubbly and made me a london fog, even though it wasn't on the list of drinks.  The hot drinks go for around $3.50 for a large, which is the cheapest I have seen in a while!  I also got a piece of blueberry cheesecake as a treat, which was really good and not too rich.  

I loved Sunterra!  It is probably a good thing I don't live too close to it, because I would come here all the time and with so many yummy things around it could be dangerous!"}
{"text":"Awesome little store. Great food and great produce"}
{"text":"My favourite Sunterra by FAR! 
I have been to both Sunterra's in the core, the one on elbow dr ( if it's still there) and the one just past sarcee tr ( up bow tr.) So once again, the Keynote...my Fave! 
It has: 
charm, space, patio, deli, dessert counters, coffee shop, eating area down stairs and upstairs, kitchen upstairs, deli and salad bars down stairs, groceries throughout, tester stands, flower stand, good parking, many cash registers, tons of service, amazing food!! 
l sure hope I am not leaving anything out - but ya right, like that isn't enough reasons to come and check it out for yourself. 
Not only is the location and building appealing in itself, the entire layout of the market is great! It truly is a really nice place. Great for lunch! Right now it's my most favourite place to go visit here in Calgary- No, seriously it is! 
Whether I'm heading over for lunch, ( which I do often ) or to pick up a few items that you can't really find anywhere else, or to come for a cup of coffee on the weekend - this Sunterra is perfect for all those! 

That's why I really like Sunterra :) 
I can just swing by, grab something really yummy AND healthy to eat, and get to sit down by the huge windows and just watch the hustle and bustle outside and inside, and yet feel relaxed and comfortable! Perfect."}
{"text":"Over priced!!!!!!!!!everything is 20%30% more expensive then anywhere  else .
This place is the typical fancy pancy place that need to sell at extremely high prices  for no reason....."}
{"text":"Take a grocery store, cafeteria, restaurant and cooking lesson facility, scrunch it together in a modernly designed building, and you get the passionate food monster that is Sunterra on 1st street SE. Surprisingly, there is no farm inside though I wouldn't put it passed them  as a future expansion. Why not feed the baby lamb that will be lunch one day? Sorry kids, that's life!

However, today I find myself on the second floor of this ode to all that is Sunterra at MARKETBar. Now keep in mind that there seems to be two parts to the second floor. There is the cafeteria part and the restaurant part. I always find myself on the cafeteria side. However, I have heard that the same kinds of food can be ordered on both parts, but with a hefty mark-up on the restaurant side. 

There are a number of tables to sit down on both inside and outside; there is a patio on weather appropriate days. I find the food decent. It's nice to have options for real food. For example, I ordered the pork loin special which included potatoes and steamed vegetables (though clearly they are boiled) for a reasonable $8.99. The prices on the drinks are expensive though. It was $2.09 for a small bottle of Orangina. Kind of pricey, given that Orangina isn't as precious as it once was. I think you can buy tubs of it now!

All in all good atmosphere, decent service, decent food, reasonably priced minus the drinks. It will be in the repertoire for lunch spots. Will give 4 stars if I can feed the pig that will be my lunch one day!

{"text":"I really like the idea of having this urban food market, specially when is so close to work, although it feels a bit crowded? things really close together, but I like getting a few things there on the way home. 

Desserts are pretty good, and only been once to the restaurant upstairs and it was quite nice. Would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Much improved since opening day. For those customers who avoided this Sunterra due to the first couple years of disorderly rude employees and disorganized shelves with missing pricing, come back and you will find a new store. They hired a new grocery manager from Sobeys who reorganized, retrained and did an awesome job to transform Sunterra Keynote to its original vision. The Management change has seemed to positively influence all the other departments as well. 

The best quality about Sunterra is the availability of unique items and while pricey, they don't blatantly gouge you like they do at Sobeys or Community Natural Foods. While the Canadian grocers try desperately to match the American's in their quest to recreate Whole Foods and Trader Joes; after a couple years of fine tuning and new management, Sunterra has successfully done so with its Keynote location!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by this grocery store.  Perhaps my expectations should be tempered since Calgary's downtown is at the beginning of its residential resurgence, but while Sunterra was large, its offerings were not all that wonderful. Now, I'm a visitor to Calgary, and maybe the effects of capitalism in the United States has spoiled me, but if I could muster investors, I would open a gourmet grocery within shouting distance of all those condos near 1st and 13th."}
{"text":"Since this place opened near my office in the East Village it's the best place around to get something healthy to eat at a somewhat decent price. Love the selection of great salads and am addicted to the fresh squeezed orange juice they have. If you go at lunch you can subsidize your meal by eating all the great samples they have out too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Market to visit for high quality items & their brunch food menu. This is where I buy Stollen (Fruit Bread) every season. Every time I purchase items from this establishment, I am always satisfied with the purchase. 

The food & coffee are well made & just the right amount of seasoning. I would go here more often for breakfast if it wasn't so far out to get here."}
{"text":"A very nice place to eat. Food and service is great. I loved their burger and house salad!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for a while, I was there a few months ago and I don't know whom the individual was ( a heavier set man in a dress shirt) appeared to be doing an audit or management type. Anyhow his behavior towards other workers disgusted me as a customer. Obviously needs training is respect."}
{"text":"They are an okay market - a bit pretentious and over priced. It is pleasant enough to shop in.  The bakery goods are okay, but often too sweet. The restaurant is hit and miss for quality but very reasonably priced. I used to frequent them but I just prefer to go other places for groceries and eating out mostly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Breakfast Crepe from the upstairs section and it was really filling and delish! The seating is nice and you don't have to worry about being disturb by a waiter or anything as it is cafeteria style (but more upscale seating than a cafeteria). 

They had free samples in the grocery section, reimbursed parking if you purchased over $5 and had awesome looking gelato!"}
{"text":"I took a trip over to this location of Sunterra Market over the weekend and I was MORE than impressed.

Their selection of produce, food and snacks was extremely impressive. Plus their masterpieces in the desserts and deli section had me salivating on the spot.

The best part of it all is that I realized that the prices at Sunterra Market really aren't that much more expensive than other grocery stores when it comes to certain groceries. I bought some crackers and jam and they cost pretty much the same as they would at a local COOP or Safeway. 

Plus I couldn't help but notice how gorgeous their flower bouquets are! Yes, they are on the pricey side, but they are stunning and extremely unique, so no wonder!

Overall, I am a HUGE fan of Sunterra. Every time I go, it just keeps gettin' better."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they opened.

The market is amazing and has a lot of great options. Their fishmonger has a great selection. Butchers has a lot of great cuts of beef.

Upstairs they have a nice bistro with a lot of fresh foods and tasty homemade soups.

Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Sunterra is pretty consistent at all locations with similar menu items and grocery layout. This location is in a convenient location if you live in the south but is probably my least favourite of all the stores because they have less selection when it comes to take out foods. 

They have a small bakery section, but wonderful desserts that taste amazing!

When you first walk into the market, you will experience a small cafeteria area so people can meet and have coffee. Provides a cozy atmosphere and makes the shopping experience more natural and convenient."}
{"text":"I wish all grocery stores looked as pretty as this one. I'm not a fan of grocery shopping, so when I do it, I want the environment to as pretty as possible.
Sunterra has fabulous deserts, baked goods and fresh OJ. The fresh meats are better than other grocery stores, by far. The cheese selection is a total delight for a cheese lover.
They're pre-prepared food are great in a pinch. In general, most dishes lack robust flavor, so it's not my first choice. I know they try new recipes, but they should try new ones more often. I'd also love for them to collect customer feedback so they can improve the take away goods.
The staff are delightful and I love visiting."}
{"text":"I have never loved a grocery store as much as I have loved Sunterra.  Please come to California.  I loved everything about it - the convenience, the feel, the offerings.  It was on the first floor of the condo I was staying at so the convenience could not be beat.  The food was fresh (even the prepackaged goods) and the baked goods were so yummy.  I mustered up enough self control to not buy out the whole department.  We tried the pre-made pizza which was good but I didn't bake in the oven long enough.  If I were ever to visit again, I would have every meal here."}
{"text":"Good selection of foods, service is great and always a clean environment, staff is also friendly"}
{"text":"Expensive, but well worth it.

Funky, Fun and if you are a foodie this is a little slice of heaven.  Interesting produce, and imported hard to get items.

Meals at their restaurant/cafeteria are CHEAP, but like some of the other reviews have said can be exceptional or just average.  I find the soups very good but the curries bland."}
{"text":"I love this place. 
It also happens to be in between work and home, so that helps. 

I only frequent the market area. 
The bar and restaurant area upstairs I have been to once. It was a little disorganized and the staff seemed as confused as me. 

But downstairs is a dream supermarket. 
It's local, a lot of organic, and although some gripe about the price, it's comparable and sometimes more affordable than any Safeway I've ever been into."}
{"text":"The produce is mediocre and they use the same supplier as Safeway.

The deli counter service is very slow."}
{"text":"We were invited to a semi-retirement party up the stairs at Sunterra Market on 12th where I had no idea they had meeting rooms or even a restaurant for that matter! Quite impressed. The Community Table as it is called is staffed by a couple of members (who were amazing this night, R and R, you were so friendly and went out of your way to make the party a good one!) who feed the guests inside the room and even serve your beverage for you. The party was in a space that also doubles as a place for cooking classes via Sunterra so there was a kitchen and a couple of long folding tables that fit inside the room. The party was intimate and had just the right amount of space for the people invited without anyone having to go without a chair. Included in the very reasonable cost of having a function here was red wine, white wine and a selection of bottled beer, even Corona which I was impressed with. The food 'buffet style' along the kitchen counter was made up of appies that included shrimp skewers wrapped in meats, crab puff pastries (Oh God yum!), wraps, fresh chicken spring rolls, quiches, fruit, cheeses, crackers and the like. And you know it is going to be fresh coming straight from downstairs. A good time was had by all and I am so glad they have a licence to serve alcohol up there. The night was complete with a tour of the restaurant on the top level and I was impressed with that too although I am sure it looks different during the day with hundreds of people up there!
I was happy to get to know Calgary just a wee bit more this evening. It seems as though Sunterra plays into the community beautifully and it has a lot going on for it that I did not even know about - including catering!"}
{"text":"While I love the concept of Sunterra's restaurant food offerings which are prepared to order at a reasonable price, I was sadly disappointed with my meal. I walked in with a craving for tofu and veggies on rice (not typical of me!) and was pleased to see exactly that on their menu board for a mere $6.49. What came out was a goopy brown mess, so salty and distasteful that I was embarrassed for them. Perhaps the cook has a \"more is better\" philosophy when he poured the entire jar of stir fry sauce on my plate. Perhaps even worse was the condition my husband's side salad was in. You know when you find that forgotten bag of salad in your fridge, all brown and sad? It's ok if I try to serve it in your own home, but not what i'd expect at a place that boasts  fresh, wholesome food."}
{"text":"Hard to beat fresh locally prepared food, the finest produce and a kickass restaurant that is incredibly affordable for what you get. The wines are world class and about $35-65 a bottle. Exceptional value at the restaurant overall or what we like to do is take the food home. from $8-15 for a meal for 2 people, you can't beat the value as the quality and price are second to none in Calgary."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were doing date night and wanted to grab a bite before heading down to the Fireworks. I work near here, and have got lunch before and what not and always impressed with the food. So figured let's check it out for dinner, the menu looks great. 

We had a wonderful server, came around just enough, was polite and able to answers any questions we had. 

We started with the double smoked bacon wrapped shrimp, which was delicious, I mean it's bacon and shrimp, you can't go wrong. For dinner I had the Pesto chicken, which was full of flavor, great fresh veggies and scrumptious little potatoes. Steve had the pineapple mango halibut, and him living on the coast is very picky about his halibut and loved it! It came with the same veggies as mine and coconut rice. We didn't have dessert, but they looked great as well. 

Now knowing this, I could see it being a go to spot to get a meal after work. If you're in the area, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch if you are nearby. The core menu has been the same for over 2 years,  with a rotating lunch special. It can get very, very repetitive if you frequent MARKETbar often, but every once in a while is great. A tasty, filling lunch will run you about $10 with a drink. I would recommend the bacon asiago melt burger... it is delicious! They load on the bacon and cheese. Try it!"}
{"text":"Sunterra West Market, I used to love you, but now you are becoming sorta so-so. Please change back. I hear there is a new manager, which would explain the changes. The reason people go to Sunterra is for the unique products, the better-than-average deli, the specialty products, the good quality prepared foods, the local meat and produce, and those extra touches that make you less of a chain-supermarket than the worker-oppressing, farmer-nickle-and-diming super-everything-market.

Stop taking away the things I loved. Those wonderful stuffed chicken breasts in individual portions, the always ready salmon burgers and fish skewers, the well-made artisan sandwiches than now have mangy fillings slapped together, the locally sourced meats, that today were replaced by Ontario turkeys (yes Mr. Manager, you can find organic turkey in Alberta! Please support our farmers). Your shelves have lost some products that you have been slow to resource. Finally, you need to improve your bread department! 

I want to keep shopping here and I want you to be different than those other markets, but it you keep devolving I will move by business along."}
{"text":"Love love love the supermarket and deli with its array of beautiful cuts of meat, seafood and prepared dishes. Based on this I thought the buffet would be good as well. Absolutely hated the Sunday buffet... The safest thing was eggs and bacon but the bacon tastes awful. My salad was good but no one else from my 7 person party enjoyed their food. Based on the buffet experience, what would have been 5 stars has been downgraded to 3."}
{"text":"So excited to come here. Too bad it so far away from where I live. The staff here were friendly and very helpful. Didn't have to wait long in line. Good selection of salads, hot food and sandwiches.  But what I was most excited about was the bakery. Wow a great verity of baked goods for a decent price. Full fruit pies and cakes, bars, cookies, macaroons and so much more. Sweet tooth heaven. 

The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the parking. For people who don't come here often it's a bit confusing. You pay for parking and then get reimbursed for your parking ticket inside. On the paying kiosk it said you don't have to display your ticket on your dashboard but upon returning to our car there was a parking ticket. Went in to dispute with the store manager he said he would look into it. Hopefully it gets resolved. Next will walk there LOL!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't like rookie packers.  They forgot items and I didn't bother checking because I normally didn't need to.  Check your bags people, staffers aren't doing what they should.  May consider elsewhere in the future if I have to watch who is packing my bags."}
{"text":"Sunterra is Sunterra is Sunterra. Read any of the reviews on Yelp and you'll probably see extremely positive words about the great quality and freshness of food, responsibility level of the company etc. This one is no different. You'll find nice staff, decent prices, and a variety of lunchtime assortments. 

There is a cooking classroom located on the second floor, which is beautiful and brings hope to the undomestic lady in me. Wait, the undomestic lady is ALL of me.

The third floor, pizzas, quesadillas etc, seems to have been overlooked when they were discussing the layout. One tiny corridor holds lines to pay, which overlap with long lines to get your pizza/quesadillas, which overlaps with other lines to pay, which all obscures the drink cooler so you have to fight your way through people to pick out a beverage, which overlaps with people who are lost because nobody knows whether to order first (and where to do so), or pay first, because there's no signage and no clear stations for ordering. This was definitely a gross oversight and makes for an extremely crowded, extremely annoying lunchtime experience."}
{"text":"I love when I'm in a downtown location and I'm looking for some groceries and there is a cute grocery store like this. Especially with a nice cheese selection and dessert section. Lots of goodies. And healthy fare also. Had a nice salad/olive bar. Lots of to go items as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The groceries here are insanely expensive, but it's a nice place to pick up a grab and go meal on a night you don't feel like cooking. 

Try the \"pie in a cup\". It's literally just a piece of pie wedged into a plastic cup with whipped cream squirted on top, but Sunterra's pie recipes are fantastic. In particular, I love the pecan pie as it's not so much a traditional pecan pie filling as it is a dense  cup of pecans held together with syrupy goodness."}
{"text":"I went to the little restaurant in Sunterra market for dinner tonight and I find that it is hit and miss.  I have had delicious dinners in there, and other times it is more in the a-ok category.  I ordered the half chicken with a side of tomato bisque.  The tomato bisque was amazing, but the chicken was so dry it was staring to get hard.  I find that it has never been bad enough that I wouldn't go back, but it is not consistently good enough that I am ready to give it five stars.  Now where I HAVE had a consistently good meal is breakfast.  They make one heck of a breakfast there."}
{"text":"This is the nicest subterranean in the city in my opinion and the selection is pretty good too.

Obviously if you've ever been you know the price range is pretty high but I mean they don't lie..everything is very fresh and organic 

Source: I worked there"}
{"text":"Not many grocery stores in this area and this place sure stands out.

Walking in it felt high end. The aisles were wide. It had people but didn't feel super busy.

The items  were very well organized, a decent selection of each item. 

They had a dessert section with lots of yummy options. The bread selection didnt seem the biggest.

Prepared foods there was plenty.

Parking is validated if under 30 minutes. At least for the spots I had in front.

It's probably a bit pricier but there just did not seem to be many options in the area."}
{"text":"Spoke with the hostess on Friday night. Apparently, a person is not allowed to take food from the order and pick-up side and bring the same food over to the flashy lounge side to watch the game on the big screen. The lounge side is off the upscale menu only. Thought you should know. Also...the introductory $5.89 dinners have now, predictably, disappeared. Still a great place to be."}
{"text":"Sunterra is one of Calgary's gold-finds. This location in particular, however, is a foodie's paradise. Not only does it have awesome groceries and prepped meals for the last minute shopper, it's eat-in counter has a wonderful loft with large windows that make for a wonderful dining experience on a sunny day. 

The food and service are particularly good at this location. I've been for both breakfast and lunch, and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. For breakfast, I'd recommend the breakfast fajita. And for lunch? Whatever the special happens to be that day. Honestly, you will not regret having ordered the special."}
{"text":"Yep. Still eye-wateringly expensive. That's sunterra for ya. Is it what it is. 

All the 5* reviews have good points, however, notice that its about the quality of much of the food. No argument there.

Plot 5* reviews against income level? Now that would be an interesting read... ;)

The trick is with Sunterra is shop there for stuff you can't get anywhere else. Exotic imported weird stuff from Europe say.

Milk, eggs, cheese, flour, bulk bread etc? Wal-Mart/Superstore."}
{"text":"I am a Sunterra fan and I desperately hope that they open one in my neighborhood.  This one is not near my house but as the Keynote location I've been meaning to check it out.  I had hopes that it would be similar to the one on Sirocco Dr and I was not disappointed.  The main floor is a fully stocked grocery with the large selection of ready made meals you expect from Sunterra.  There is also an extensive bakery, great selection of fresh produce (organic is well represented) and then all of your staple grocery items with some neat items like Philip Adams products.  I stopped in to pick up lunch for a visit with a friend so I headed right to the ready made section.  Next time I will try the restaurant as I'm told it is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Great selection of food. 
Prices are good and portions are decent. 
Quality for pizzas, sandwiches and big pan are good. 
The burgers and breakfast food is hit or miss for freshness. 
Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Sunterra Market has multiple locations, but this one is in a residential neighbourhood; most of the others are downtown. Brunch specials are $6-8 per dish, and the portions are smallish but tasty. The specials are limited before 11AM  but after that the selection widens a lot. A great casual dining place, and modestly priced."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great breakfast.  value for lunch too!  Their fresh bread is some of the best quality and price in Calgary.  A gem."}
{"text":"I've been looking for more organic non GMO products.. so tried Sunterra... I admit they are better than some but generally they are overpriced on many things and their organic selection sucks ass compared to the farmers markets...   granted, they are open later than the markets...  however Co-Op, Superstore, and Slaveway all are now carrying organic products as well, and on a lot of things the prices were better than Sunterra...  Sunterra is more of a store for some hipster products than a good organic/non-gmo healthy store

I won't go out of my way to shop there, I can get everything I need by combining shopping at the local super markets and the 3 big farmer's markets in Calgary... I find the organic free range meats better at the markets as well

That said... it is not bad to go there for a bistro hang out or bakery items... however those are not really on my list these days... Calgary was crappy for organic produce in the past, but things are getting much better in the past year or two... and prices are getting better as well...  

I'd honestly shop at Planet Organic long before going to sunterra."}
{"text":"I like Sunterra Market.  Reminds me of the neat little grocery markets they have in New York.  It has everything - bakery, deli meats, fruit section, salads, butcher, seafood, cooked food, fresh vegetables and fruits, gelato, coffee bar, and the different aisles of food items like oilve oil and balsamic vinegar, italian foods, soda, canned foods, coffe grounds and so many other items.  They also give out free samples of food.  Today, I had a slice of their BBQ Chicken Pizza.  There was also a sampling of bread where you can dip the oil and vinegar. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always impressed when I go into a Sunterra...has a nice vibe to the place.  I was a regular at the downtown Sunterra which is huge so thought I would try the west location, which did not disappoint. The kitchen isn't as big and much less variety for lunch, but it's still awesome. 

The people are always friendly and nice to talk with. Salads, sandwiches and desserts taste super good. 

The grocery section is a bit pricey but they stock other items you can't always find in your typical grocery store."}
{"text":"I was blown away the first time I came here. I just wanted my free pie and it turned out to be a $17 massive apple pie! Great place for charcuterie meats, cheese, premade food items, small amounts of raw meats, etc. It isn't much pricier than any other market such as Bridgeland Market. Parking is out back and is validated for a minimum $5 purchase ( 1/2 hour free). I would have appreciated the parking info somewhere on their website."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch not to long ago and since she was late I was able to wander around through the store checking everything out.  A little bit overwhelming for a first timer, but I was in love.

When I first moved to Calgary I lived out near Britannia Plaza in the South.  Being a former Vancouverite (and lover of Meinhardt's & Urban Fare) The Sunterra Market  was a place I discovered & frequented on the weekends.  Being part of the community I also loved it when they put on their free summer BBQ's.

When my girlfriend finally arrived she was pressed for time so we both decided on the self serve salad bar.  Loved the selection of items.  Just as she was leaving my hubs showed up to drop off my son (juggling act).  Hubs had not had lunch yet so grabbed some wings to go.  His feedback indicated he was quite happy with his meal.

My son and I continued to wander around the store picking up some items (vegetables, desserts, sausage, cheese) and of course a coffee before we left for home.

I love how you can stop in here and grab something to make at home, warm up at work or home, eat in or eat on the go.  So many options for a busy family!  The food is fresh and the staff helpful and friendly.  I was also able to find a parking spot on the street but there is parking underground."}
{"text":"I've been a customer at Sunterra for years, and with the exception of my experience today I've always left satisfied. Today I went in to Sunterra Keynote for lunch with a few clients. I hit the salad bar on the main level, paid for the salad downstairs than went upstairs to get a bowl of soup. The manager upstairs named Rahel accused me of stealing the salad (IN FRONT OF MY CLIENTS!!) and escorted me downstairs to track down the cashier who took my payment. The cashier was on a break so she made me wait there while she tried to find her, it was the most humiliating experience I've ever had. Who steals a $7 salad?! I ended up walking out, terribly embarrassed with no apology and an unresolved issue with this manager. I can't believe they would treat a customer this disrespectfully."}
{"text":"What can I say to describe the Sunterra Bar in the Keynote tower?

Well, lets start with the bad.
There is no atmosphere, the service is pretty poor and the close around 10pm each night.  If you stop reading here, you will probably never go. Just look above that I rated it 4 stars still, so please read on!

The good:
Food is actually really good! They have a few good beers on tap and there is always a seat. The best however is the wine list!  They have a very wide range of tasty and cheap wines by the glass and lots by the bottle! They have a Spanish Grenache for $25 that you see at other restaurants for over $60!

This is the place to go before a flames game or a concert at the Saddledome for sure! A big meal and affordable drinks is rare in this city, especially this close to the Stampede grounds! 

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"You know what? Marketbar is growing on me like a vine of ivy on a garden lattice. We've had several encounters now, mostly for coffee, but the odd breakfast or lunch outing as well. And Marketbar, the more time I spend with you, the more I'm smokin' what you're rollin'.

The staff are doin' a great job between keeping customers served while in the midst of preparing all those hot meals, there's plenty of space to sit down with your coffee, food, newspaper, laptop, etc. and it's all mighty clean and well cared for.

The menu for the lounge side looks mighty appetizing, though I've only been on that side for some meetups at this point. But with a decent drink selection and what looks to be deliciousness on the menu, you might just find me here for a casual evening out soon enough.

{"text":"I love eating here!! How long has this grocery store been open? I feel like I've been going here since I was 13 or 14? I love the little restaurant on the inside and I often go here to meet my family for dinner. 

Another thing I love about this place is the bakery! I bought a chocolate cheesecake here on July 1st for my dad for his birthday and it was really good! Not sure who ate all of it though!"}
{"text":"This is my fave Sunterra. Not sure if it's because it is also head office but love the increased selection (compared to Britannia) and appreciate the bakery on site. Perfect for grocery shopping, picking up fresh meat and cheese or a quick dinner. This has quickly become my fave grocery store. Also helps to have a Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"I miss the old Sunterra: the personal touch that makes it Ok to pay more for things and staff that cares. 

I was their Keynote location yesterday wanting to buy ingredients for a Caesar salad  - love their dressing. 

No dressing out, had to wait in line and get someone to dig some put from the back.  Wanted shredded Parmesan cheese - none. Woman at the cheese counter said they are too busy to shred any. 

Guy at the bakery counter didn't know if they had any croutons. Told me to take a look around.

On the bright side, they did have over priced romaine lettuce. 

Next stop - Sobeys."}
{"text":"I miss the old Sunterra - good service, staff that care you're there. 

I was there today wanting to buy flax seed oil and clarified coconut oil. I looked at the shelf and couldn't see. Ask 3 employees who passed and all said they'd have to get someone else.  No one else came by so I left. One em Pl Moyer actually said \" you should try to find someone by the check out, they might know.\" That was not helpful. I left without what I wanted ."}
{"text":"I attended a day long event today that was catered by Sunterra.  They provided breakfast, lunch and a mid afternoon snack for eight, but truly it could have fed a small army.  No one needs to eat that much food.  However, I made a solid effort and now I feel like I'm going to explode.  

The breakfast portions per person were absolutely huge and at least half of the calories I'd eat in one day.  We each were given a mini jug of fresh hand-squeezed orange juice, a sizable fruit cup, choice of a jumbo scone or muffin and a huge yogurt and granola cup.  The yogurt cup also included fruit on the bottom and was to die for.  It was so rich, delicious and filling that I really didn't need to eat anything else for the rest of the day.  I snacked on the fruit later, which was good and ripe, and I had a bit of my muffin, which I actually wasn't a fan of.  Not sure if it was a bit dry or what the situation was, but the berries inside just couldn't save it.

Suddenly it's lunch time and I can barely think about eating until I see the Beef Lasagna.  Game on.  And hand me the Focaccia toast please.  I skipped the Caesar Salad because nobody's got time for that when there's desert.  The desert tray had at least 8 selections on it including cheesecake and chocolate dipped strawberries.  The lasagna is loaded with goodness and a generous helping could compete with the weight of a brick.  

Everyone was practically rolling on the floor at 1pm from calorie overload and we were not prepared to look at any more food until the meeting ended at 3:30pm when someone realized that the afternoon snacks hadn't been served.  Oh, please.  Baggies for everyone!  First I had to sample the Shrimp Salad Roll and spicy peanut sauce to be sure it was worth taking home.  By golly, it was.  I also loaded up on a few Hyerollers and skipped out on the cheese tray.  Oh yeah, and I took home leftover fruit, yogurt, lasagna, toast and a colossal scone.  

This is seriously amazing catering (with the exception of the muffin I had) and you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Since Sunterra Market Keynote opened 6ish years ago it's been my go to for a quick quality pick up after work. From a burger & salad for $9 upstairs to deli & bakery downstairs and groceries at decent prices. Fresh produce, surf & turf, meats & cheeses you can't go wrong! Sunday morning brunch is a treat too. I've had a Sunterra card for 20+ years and those purchases add up! The staff are friendly, the location is ideal and the atmosphere is urban."}
{"text":"As a market and cafe/resto concept, this particular Sunterra gets it right.  I've enjoyed a great pasta, decent burger and salads here.  Coffee (brewed and specialty) are good, and the selection of desserts, all freshly baked on location, are absolutely wonderful (maybe not Manuel Latruwe level, but still better than most restos I've tried).  More importantly, it's all quite reasonable and the 3rd floor restaurant dining area has a great atmosphere and feeling to it.  While I wouldn't recommend the tiramisu here, I would say the squares are fab."}
{"text":"Went downtown Calgary on a Friday for lunch with family. Lots of options that you can buy on the main level and bring upstairs on the indoor terrace. Upstairs, there is a restaurant serving meals and dessert. I ordered the pea soup with chicken with a side of garlic bread and it was very tasty. My husband ordered the pork bao's. Both our mess were generous portions. We shared a caramel pastry afterwards and that was good as well. I can tell the food served here is fresh. I will let the photos I took speak for itself!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have lunch in the area... You can find different options there, from pizza to healthy food. I really like this place as is close to my workplace and the food is really good. In addition, the ambience is cool..."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome! Located right in a strip-mall/Plaza of sorts, it's got a lot of supplements and natural health products, a good amount of free sample stations from what I remember, and even a café!

I am still meaning to do a major (and healthy!) shop there :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I've been to Sunterra's 2 other old locations in Downtown and tried their catering food, never disappointed! Always fresh and tasty! 

This new location on 2street SE did not disappoint me at all! At first, I thought parking would be a disater since it's located in the busy street, however, parking can be easily found and best of all, Sunterra refund you the parking money if you shop there too!!! (This surely nothing to beat!) 

Food, we tried the take-home-to-bake 1kg beef lasagna in a tray sized 8\"x10\", so I pop it in my oven for 15 min, waahlaa, it's ready to serve! Every bite is full of ricotta cheese, beef, spinach and tomato. Ingredients are so fresh, even better taste better and fresher than most of the restaurant served lasagna!! Hard to believe, and price is very reasonable (you definitely get you paid for, and it worths every penny) for fresh and quality product. It makes excellent choice for pot luck, take out. 

Dessert, never to missed! They got lots of individual dessert, cheese cake, mango mousse, tiramisu etc... We bought tiramisu, it's not bad, I don't mind if it's more moist and stronger coffee taste (just my personal preference, I like tiramisu with stronger coffee taste)"}
{"text":"went up to the restaurant for breakfast today, and I was happy we did! lots of room to sit, and lots of choices to eat.
I got the Classic Breakfast - 2 eggs (poached) 3 sausage links, 2 slices of toast, and a huge bowl of fruit! for $6.95, which is a great deal. in my opinion.
the set up is kind of a Shitshow for ordering - lots of weird lineups that make it so you're awkwardly standing in the middle of an aisle , but you can't really move without blocking the opening for the staff to get in & out, or the drink cooler, etc etc. 
but whatever - a decent breakfast for a good price - who cares where I have to stand!"}
{"text":"Great variety of food, very expensive in terms of grocery as they try to look more sophisticated than what they really are."}
