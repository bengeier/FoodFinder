{"text":"Same menu as the other 4 bars. If you know that you know what to expect. A little on the pricy side but some of it is worth it."}
{"text":"Seanachie's is a standard neighbourhood pub. The service is hit or miss but I've found the food to be decent whenever I've been there. If you're a wing person, 10 cent wings on Mondays is hard to beat.   The pub fare is solid - chicken pot pie, shepherd's pie, steak sandwich. I like the chicken and brie burger. The cinnamon plum sauce and apple slices makes it almost seem like you're eating something healthy...  I go because I live close to the area. It's not something I can recommend you drive across the city for, but if you're there anyway, it's a good spot."}
{"text":"The Seanachie Irish Pub in Westhills is a fine pub to escape to if your lady views shopping at the Winners as an all day affair.  Maybe it's just me, but if I'm putting in an 8 hour day at a store, they should be paying me, not the other way around!   But I digress. She's happy there, I'm more than happy to spend time at the Seanachie.  The inside is full of dark wood and brass, which makes for an inviting atmosphere.  As a dedicated bargain hunter, I'm particularly fond of the times when my lady chooses to shop on a Tuesday.  That's because they have glasses of CBP Lager for a mere $1.50, and after 4pm they offer their tasty bacon & cheese burger for just $6.99.  Moreover, if you're a fan of tartan skirts, you'll enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"My wife and I went last night for Wednesday specials. We have been there a dozen times over the years and always enjoy the food & service even on their busiest of nights. Finally had a Big Pub Burger and it was the best burger I have had in years! Regular price $13.95...Wednesdays only $5! Their own Craft beers are also $5 for a pint. Dinner for two including two pints for $20! Even MacDonald's can't beat that!!  Great food, service and fun atmosphere. FYI, Monday nights are wing night and it can get stupid busy especially if there is a Flames game on."}
{"text":"Seanachie is hugely overpriced for the food it offers. I stopped in for an order of potato skins and a beer and I ended up paying way more than it was worth.  The service was fine, but the place gets busy on weekends and the servers sometimes lose their focus amidst all the yelling and drinking. Go if you want a completely average evening, that costs more than average..."}
{"text":"Great service, my steak was overcooked, staff was fast and friendly in correcting my order, they even went as far as giving me half off for my meal, I didn't freak out or make big deal of it and was happy with my meal in the end. Very nice atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Great fast service.  Can't beat the Monday wing and beer special.  The food was good but I would be fine waiting a bit to get hot wings instead of getting them super fast and kinda warm.  I guess there is such a thing as too fast of service?  LOL   I'd go here again.  The place is a little too dark and couldn't read the menu that well as they used dark colours.  Nice layout and lots of parking and tables."}
{"text":"A must visit for the wings on Monday night. Jumbo wings are 0.32 cents and the flavours are great.   Also was extremely impressed with the beer selection- a number of craft beers on tap. Seasonal options too.   Reasonably priced and good pub atmosphere. Quiet sections if that's what you need."}
{"text":"Seanachie's has been a convenient place for our single's group to meet.  The food has never been that good but acceptable for a pub.  Well tonight, with new management rules, they will no longer keep individual tabs or reserve a table for our singles group.    A singles group works best when individuals can come and go in the group as desired, each paying their own tab when they leave.  Some will be there for only one drink.  Some will have several drinks and some will eat.  Without prices lists for drinks both before and after happy hour, it puts undue pressure on those wanting to leave early or those coming or  staying late.  A single bill for the group just doesn't work for that kind of group.  Fortunately Seachie's only advantage is it's central location for singles in all parts of the city.   It's food and prices will not be missed by the group."}
{"text":"Yes the nacho platter is huge. Tonnes of fresh veggies on top, salsa is meh, but these are some good looking and tasting nachoes. Good cheese distribution.  19.75 for the loaded platter, so more expensive than some but also bigger than most. Friendly staff and fewer hipsters than the annoying new place that opened up in the southern part of westhills."}
{"text":"Service is slow and terrible. We sat for 40 minutes between drinks before our server would come. Seems like the only good service is reserved for the regulars sitting at the bar. Understaffed and disappointing"}
{"text":"Fairly generic \"Irish pub\".  I use the term loosely because it feels like a hypersized and artificial setting that is made to look like an 'authentic' pub.  It is a good place to watch a game.  The selection of brews is pretty good but the food is nothing special.  I feel like the place is targeted at the 35-55 crowd, and it seems like it would appeal to them."}
{"text":"We have been faithful Seanachies customers over the years, and can honestly say I have not seen the service so poor or the place so empty. Staff is indifferent, food prices have skyrocketed, and beer specials nearly non existent. They need to work harder to get the neighborhood clientele. it was once a great place to go, but with the current service and prices, we won't be going back. The female bartender could use a good dose of personality, as she stood slumped at the other side of the bar our whole visit, and virtually ignored us. Have heard many similar concerns about the staff. But there are other pubs to choose from!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, although a little dark, but maybe that's just me. The food is so-so, the more pub-ish fare is better, but don't try the salads, they're disappointing across the board. The waitstaff are friendly and attentive when it's quiet, and I can't speak to busier times."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to say about this place, I was there for a friend's birthday, so all I did was have a drink. It was rib night when we went, which none are GF, so that wasn't an option for me. I ate previously as I had a feeling it wasn't going to end well for me food wise.   It's a big place, lots of rooms and tables and TVs. Definitely a decent watering hole to catch a game, or drink and snack with some friends."}
{"text":"This was my pal's local watering hole until he moved away.  The Seanachie is rather like hundreds of other \"Irish Pub in a Box\" kind of establishments that you find throughout North America, but that doesn't make it bad.  I've had some great times there."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend & service was poor. I brought him thinking we were going to have the same experience as I did the other day. It wasn't busy at all, ordered j√§ger bombs, takes quite a while, when it finally got to us we had only one red bull to share, still in the can. Usually they pour it into a cup each. When I asked for another one it was like they thought I was being rude. It's kind of a hit or miss because a couple days back, service was alright. The food is mediocre, I don't think it's worth it. I would recommend going to National instead just down the street."}
{"text":"If you know what you're doing, Seanachie can be a decent place, but it takes a couple of visits get the lay of the land.  The service is hit or miss, with some of the better servers working during the day usually. They will give honest opinions on food which helps because some of the menu is good (try the Boxtys) while there are dishes like their crab/artichoke dip that is simply a frozen disk of god-knows-what nukes in microwave.  They generally have some good deals on food an drinks, with the deals changing daily. Beer is average in price and they have a decent selection on tap- better than many places.  It is part of the \"Calgary's best pubs\" chain, so some things might look quite familiar, but it is a bar all it's own with a crowd that runs from the rich housewives from the neighbourhoods nearby to blue collars workers in for a drink to the employees o all the surrounding retail stores.  If you're around Signal Hill and are hungry/thirsty, this is an option to consider."}
{"text":"This place has some very good food and for the sake of food it gets some good value but honestly it has such awful service. Prepare about an hour for a \"quick bite\". You'll sit there for so long before anyone helps you and the food never comes. Happened 5/5 times I went"}
{"text":"Sure some of the food seems a little pricey, but overall not too bad. Great selection of draught beers as you would expect from an Irish pub. A huge appetizer menu which is nice when you're just there to have a couple drinks and you're not too hungry.   Go there on Mondays for wing night! Cheapest wings in the city as far as I know at 9cents a piece. And they are great."}
{"text":"Sat there for 15 minutes and nobody bothered to come to the table. Left and went to Hudson's"}
{"text":"Seanachie isn't my favourite pub in the area, but it's one that I visit a few times a year. The location is great for an apres-Westhills/Signal Hill shopping trip or dinner after coming back from my gym.   The servers are hit or miss - on my latest visit, the gentleman was friendly enough but had to be prompted several times (drink refills, cheque, etc).   I love, love the mulligatawny soup and the Guinness butter that comes with it. Unfortunately the bread was hard on my last visit, but generally the meal is quite yummy. My dining partner had a boxty and it comes highly recommended. The Angry Chicken Sandwich and turkey wrap are also winners."}
{"text":"The pub/restaurant is fairly busy most nights and is staffed well. The servers are very friendly and know the menu well. The food arrives quickly, and hot. The shepherds pie is very good, though it could be a little bigger and topped with more cheese.  They also have a good selection of beers on tap, a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"This is worst design I can imagine for access to people in wheelchairs.  1.  There is a lot of navigation required between the handicap parking spaces and the entrance to this establishment.  And part of the sidewalk you have to navigate is right beside a busy road for cars.  2.  The seating design is predominately tall bar type tables with tall chairs and bar chairs that are also tall and not appropriate for folks in a wheelchair or walker.  There are also a number of tables that are at the appropriate height for a wheelchair but there are two steps up - which is a deal breaker.  Only about 35 percent of the seating is wheelchair friendly.  And most of the clientele seems to prefer the lower seating - which means when someone in a wheelchair shoes up - there potentially could be almost no tables available for seating.  We attempted to bring my elderly father there tonight - and the place was maybe 50% full but there was no available handicapped seating.  A place with so much handicapped inaccessible seating should have a table or two of handicapped priority seating."}
{"text":"Edit: See Below **  Seems like a standard \"big box\" style \"Irish Pub. Layout is weird and not particularly welcoming.  When we were there - a band was playing. They were WAAAAAAAY too loud. Hurt our ears and weren't especially good. I can't believe how loud they were. An Irish pub should have music for ambience, but it should be setup in the corner by the fire and musicians can play and patrons can visit and talk without feeling like they have to scream to be heard by their friends. I felt like I was being forced to listen to the less-talented cousins of \"Great Big Sea\". Honestly if that is the level of talent you guys book it's indicative of your lack of attention to detail.   The place has a HUGE beer selection, but the beer I ordered was warmish and tasted like shit. I instantly got a stomach ache and felt nauseous. CLEAR INDICATION THAT THE DRAUGHT LINES ARE NOT CLEANED REGULARLY. To their credit the bar tender offered us free food as a courtesy and I ordered a more popular beer which was cold and did not taste funky.  We tried a piece of cheese cake, which was a basic \"no bake\" cheesecake - it was decent enough, but was confused in that it was topped with fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint but then was doused in strawberry jam/syrup?   Prices are HIGH in this place and I didn't see anything that warranted it. Ambience was non-existant. (unless you like horribly loud live music)  I'm also really tired of the \"waitresses in mini-skirts that look like kilts\" trope. I don't see how this does anything for anyone - unless your target market is ONLY frat-boy-bros.  I would never bring my wife here for a date, or my family here. It would be o.k. to go with buddies, I guess...but honestly with the amount of other pubs in Calgary - I don't see a real reason to go back to this place.  I'd give this place a 1 star rating, except for the exceptional service and attention by our bartender.  If this is indicative of the \"Calgary's Best Pubs\" chain - I have absolutely zero interest in visiting their other locations as I'm sure they are all over-priced, underwhelming, bland \"all things to all people\" attempts at a great bar. I'll stay with smaller mom 'n pop operations thanks!  ** Since there is no \"private messaging\" feature on Yelp - this morning, I received a \"compliment\" in the system, from what I can only assume is a manager, shift leader, owner of Seanachie's, or some other stakeholder in the business:  \"There is only live music on Saturdays and a lot of the regulars come in and stay for the music. I understand if it's not your cup of tea but to name and bash a band on yelp when critiquing a pub is uncalled for (like art music is subjective and requires courage, time, and talent). Secondly remember that the servers don't pick their uniform. Keep your judgements to food/ beverage and service .\"  In response: ALL THINGS IN A RESTAURANT ARE INDICATIVE OF MANAGEMENT ATTITUDE, AND REFLECTS THE RESTAURANT, GOOD OR BAD. If you can accept a compliment then you also need to be able to accept a criticism! If music is too loud, inappropriate, or just plain bad - that's the restaurant's fault, they should be careful not to book that band, or stay more on top of the volume levels. Secondly - ESPECIALLY because the servers don't pick their uniforms - IT'S THE RESTAURANT'S FAULT!!!!!! Why are you making your female servers wear degrading, revealing and \"sexy\" uniforms? Can't they work in COMFORTABLE and SAFE footwear and uniforms that are appropriate for a \"family style\" pub and bring me my food JUST AS WELL? Further to that - How does showing cleavage benefit the service in ANY WAY? It's trashy, degrading and it furthers the stereotype that a woman is only useful if she is young, busty and flirty/fun/sexy. It's a shame really, that you enforce these stereotypes in your restaurant. The men in your restaurants aren't wearing open shirts to show off their pecs, or tight short-shorts to accentuate their wedding tackle. Why the discrepancy? Lastly, you ARE correct: I should not have named the band, but honestly they were horrible. However, i have amended my review to remove the band name."}
{"text":"Whenever we come to Calgary, we try to get here for a meal. Love the new menu (well new to us) but miss some of the old Irish dishes. Service can be a little laid back during the day but the food keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"We go here because it's the only pub in the area. The wing nights are good and they have good specials however, the service is terrible. Haven't had one time where the service was decent. It's too bad because the foods good and the atmosphere isn't half bad either. Just need to get some people who actually know what customer service is about and who might actually like their jobs... and people."}
{"text":"Average with a capital A. In fact I've got to believe that the business model for all of \"Calgary's best pubs\" is to just shoot for average. If that was the goal, they've done a remarkable job.  That's not to say you won't enjoy your time here. See, you will. The wing flavors are good, the mains are usually pretty good (though I've got to say, $18 for waffle fries in \"potatchoes\" has got to be something like a 10,000% markup) and the beer is usually cold.  Casual is par the course here - there's  no attempt to be more than what they really are - a decent neighborhood Irish pub. It's sort of like finding a snow shovel at the end of the rainbow instead of a pot of gold. Disappointing? Well, sometimes. But hey, you just got a free shovel, and that's pretty worthwhile.   On the whole, Seanachie is sort of like the Honda Civic of bars. Yeah, it's a pretty reliable standby, but it's not all that innovative, fun or sexy. It's a good place, you'll probably come back, but you won't rave about it."}
{"text":"The best kept secret for weekend brunch!!  We go to Seanachie quite often, it's down the road from us.  The boxty's are fabulous, but the real deal of the week is their budget breakfast (but not so budget sized!).  For $5.99 you can get either eggs Benedict with hashbrowns, or a bacon, sausage, egg and toast deal.  It fills you up and doesn't cost an arm and a leg to eat.  The service has always been good on the weekends for breakfast, maybe because the loud, obnoxious drunk guys from the night before are still sleeping :)"}
{"text":"Terrible from start to finish.  We went for a late lunch on a Tuesday.  There was another couple at a table and two people at the bar, one server, one bartender.  It took a while to get service, even though we were greeted when we came in.  We ordered wine and waited quite a while long for that.  The server poured the wine in the glass and it actually smelled skunky, not like bad wine, but like a bathroom (to put it nicely).  The carafe did not smell so it must have been a dirty glass.  Never had that experience before and we have dined out a lot in many cities around the world.  The water glasses were quite filthy as well, like they had not been washed in days.  Really very gross.  Our disappointment continued with the food, which took forever to arrive and was lukewarm.  Potato skins had very little cheese and only a few shards of bacon on the plate.  The chicken entree arrived as a sandwich, even though it was not a sandwich on the menu.  The lamb burger was almost $20 and tasted like a cheap beef patty with filler.  Overcooked to the extreme, it was completely inedible.  The yam fries were just OK and they were the best part of the entire meal, although cost $3 extra to have them as a side.    The server didn't come to check on us after delivering the entrees and we had to flag her down to get the bill.  When she brought the POS machine she suddenly became Miss Personality but still didn't ask how our meal was, even though most of it was still on the plates. Horrible experience and we will never go back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after work on a Friday night because it's right near where I work, and I needed somewhere to eat since I hadn't moved any of my stuff in from Winnipeg yet, so I couldn't cook!  I walked up and had a seat at the bar, and had a pleasant bartender suggest the special right away, saying it's very good. Turns out, it wasn't. I had the cod, and there was more batter than there was fish. It does come with a generous portion of fries, though, which was good.  After a short time, another bartender came by for orders before happy hour ends, which I thought was a nice touch. He also introduced himself, asked if I'd be around more often. That probably won my business for at least one more Friday night after work..."}
{"text":"I tried poutine for the first time here and it was really good! The decor and ambience is very well done and inviting and they have a wide beer selection. Friendly staff, clean bathrooms, and great beer!"}
{"text":"Cozy classic pub atmosphere. Cant beat their .09 cent wings on Monday nights. For a beer and 20 wings was less than $8!!!! Are they the best wings? No. But for the price its a great affordable destination with friends."}
{"text":"Okay so I was recently here for a networking event and I walked in, only to see the place was sort of \"divided\" into what looked like a cross between booths and rooms. I was expecting to meet a group of similar professionals, but it took a while to find them in the room in the back-right of the pub. Thank goodness it was early and not crowded yet, or I may never have found them hahaha.  Anyways, the seating was slightly wobbly, but once you get used to it (and don't drink too much) it's possible to keep one's balance. I understand they were having 1c ribs that night (it was a Wednesday) and a couple of people ordered some. It sure fed us well, excellent place to bring a group of pals. Their drink prices weren't outrageous either. However, the location is just on the way into Signal Hill Centre, which is great if you already happen to be in the area, but if you're coming in from way across town, it can be just slightly difficult to get to. If you're like me and don't drive, then you'll need to take the #108, and if that's not a bus stop near you, call 403-262-1000 to find another one that goes there.   Anyways I'd definitely go again! If you are a business person and attend networking events there, you may even see me in my pink wig from time to time ;)"}
