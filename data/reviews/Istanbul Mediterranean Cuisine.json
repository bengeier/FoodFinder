{"text":"Actually, in comparison with some of the other reviews, I had excellent service. Our waiter was fantastic. He not only kept the delicious bread coming but he prepped the olive oil & Parmesan. My friends had some special requests-- no eggs in bread (so he offered and brought over bread with no eggs!) and he heated up the grape leaves, for example. 

I had the hummus ring with lamb. Though mostly a good dish, the lamb was (I know this sound stingy but..) NOT worth the extra $2. It was dry. I should have just gotten the chicken--which my friend had and was grilled really nicely. 

They have a prix fixe menu on Monday and Tuesdays. It was (I believe) $15 for a soup/salad and entree or some nice combo like that. I will definitely be back to try it! 

Oh, and please get the flaming cheese if not (also) for the entertainment of the other guests in the room. I love watching them light it up at the table!!"}
{"text":"so i'm still on the fence with this restaurant and need to go back before I can give a for-sure rating, but here's what I got from the first time around:
i got takeout from istanbul a couple weeks ago and got the platter with hummus, falafel, rice and pita. the falafel was okay, i think it would've been way better if it wasn't submerged in the hummus and therefore became soggy by the time i ate it...and the flavor of the hummus was good but just a little 'runny' for my liking (i would def get again though). the rice, again, was okay but didn't have the flavor i wanted...will give it another shot though. 
my boy got grilled beef (forgot the name of the dish) that came with rice and pita and he ate it right up! said it was well seasoned and loved it in the pita with lettuce, tomato and the white sauce (always forget how to spell it so i just simply say white sauce. forgive me). and he had leftovers for the next day and said it was even yummier.
so in a nutshell, I was not so much disappointed in the food, per se, but want to try dining in to get the full experience of the food...
til then...."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for their current 1/2 price Tuesday lunch special. 

The setting is nice, quiet and clean. Our waitress was kind of bad though. She didn't speak much english so it was hard to explain things to her. I was afraid she was going to get my order wrong. She did. I got the Turkish Delight which comes with rice or hummus. I ordered hummus and got rice. She fixed it though. Before that, she had to come back to ask me what I even ordered. The dish was good though.

My friend got the salmon sandwich with fries. Not sure how it was...

For 1/2 price, I'll take it. They have a lot of good sounding things on the menu. I'll have to try some more of their other things."}
{"text":"Istanbul is a gem. All their food is hearty, moist, home-made and healthy. In a world of restaurants where food is greasy, Istanbul is a singularity, and truly genuine in nature.

Their service could use a bit of improvement, like bringing stuff without you having to ask for it, (like napkins, bread, etc). But I go there often and see they are training \"newbies\", so they better train them good to hang around and be helpful and not sometimes just leave (The female waitresses are a bit worse doing their job than the male ones). 

Other than that, the decor and ambiance are pretty cool and genuine (Mediterranean and Eastern music plays on the background, hand-painted paintings on the wall), and the food is fresh and wholesome. 

Ask for their lentil soup and falafel appetizer together, with extra tahini sauce. They make a great combo! Then top it off with a chicken and lamb combo on a skewer--it comes with rice and a salad. Finally, order the hot lava cake or their original dessert and you are set. We come back every time for more. It's just too good."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and unattentive service.  Mediocre food.  Cheesy decor."}
{"text":"It's okay, not great.  A bit over spiced and heavy handed. Swrvice is not the best. Fingers on your food, etc."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews, I was pretty darn sure I would like Istanbul.  And you know what?  I did.

However, it wasn't perfect.  I arrived with my family on the afternoon of the 4th of July.  When we walked in, we noticed that we were the only people in the restaurant.  Once seated, the waiter brought out some piping hot bread.  And, here's why I give Istanbul 4 not 5 stars: he said \"this is our house bread, we warm it up every day.\"  All right, buddy, do you mean you \"bake\" it every day, or are you admitting that your chef is \"too lazy to bake it\" every day?  The bread definitely didn't taste fresh.  We then ordered some saganaki, which was delicious. 

However, once the food arrived, (almost) all was forgiven.  My salmon kebab was absolutely perfect: buttery salmon infused with the flavor of roasted tomatoes, onions and peppers.   Also, the salad was coated in very thin lemony dressing, which was a welcome a departure from the thick processed bottled dressings a lot of restaurants have.

All in all, I enjoyed Istanbul, and I will return soon.  It's totally worth the trek off campus."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign, to be sure. Although the departure of lamacun from their menu was sad for my husband and I, some impressive fresh fish and seafood changes have made up for it! They've made impressive changes to their lunch options, but wouldn't recommend going unless you have plenty of time! One downside is that multiple times the kitchen has made mistakes on my entrees, or another person at my table's entrees. Once the issue is resolved, the restaurant still remains a favorite."}
{"text":"How many stars do you give to a dying restaurant?  This place will close December 31, 2010.  We had our last great meal there on December 20, but its final days are numbered. Signs in the windows proclaim it will be closed on January 1, 2011."}
{"text":"believe it or not, i've been in a bit of a funk in the food department. it had been way too long since i walked away from a meal at a restaurant and felt really wowed. little did i expect to get my mojo back in downstate illinois (champaign, to be exact). my brother had made reservations for us to celebrate his graduation at Istanbul Mediterranean, a restaurant highly recommended by his friends. in particular, one of his friends, works there and happened to be our server for that night.  what a warm, wonderful treat! 

i learned from kostas that istanbul is owned by some family friends, and he had a hand in planning much of the menu - the moussaka is his own mother's recipe! that the chicken kabobs were impossibly tender because of a technique of using water-soaked bread in the chicken while grilling. let me tell you, everything was a-ma-zing. i attacked my dad's grilled meat platter, punctuated by repeated exclamations of \"oh my god, this is sooooo good!\" one the standouts was the gyro meat, fresh and perfectly lamby.....barely akin to the scary spit of questionable meat product that we're used to from the street vendor or neighborhood diner. my brother's imam bayladi (stuffed eggplant w/ tomato sauce, greek cheese, and lots of other goodness) and my mom's chicken w/ spinach sauce were equally as wonderful and all got their fair attention from my wandering fork. everyone else loved the food too, which is REALLY hard to accomplish with my difficult family (mom basically only eats chicken, dad is a snob about his meat and seafood, brother is a vegetarian, and i have little patience for mediocre food).

istanbul reminded me of the joys of a fantastic meal - the kind that you continue to talk about long after it is over. this is a great little family-owned restaurant that places a premium on authenticity and service. i want to make sure they get all the help they can, because their location deep within a strip mall and far away from the U of I campus doesn't bode well...if you are ever in the area, please give this gem a visit!"}
{"text":"Nope. Sorry. Wrong place. I was looking for a nice restaurant with competent staff serving good food. My mistake. I'll know next time.

Istanbul does not measure up. I went on a Sunday night with a group of about 13 or so and was disappointed in each of the big 3: service, ambiance, the meal. 

Ambiance goes first, because here they really gave it a shot. They had a harp player that was really enjoyable until she left before dinner was over (she cut out only a little after 7:30, while many parties were still arriving). The decor at Istanbul is fairly typical, if not tacky in an unobtrusive way, but comparable to any mid-level Asian joint. They aggressively  chilled the place to about 59 degrees by way of a Messerschmidt-powered AC unit.

Service was really bad. I saw no busboys, so all the duties fell upon our server, who just did not seem to be all there. He had a couple of other tables, and kept getting more, despite the fact that just our one table was clearly stretching his resources and further despite the fact that he had not been entrusted with a tray, so any time he brought something to the table, he only brought that one thing. Two waters, coming right up. Three? Hold on, give me a minute. 

Our group did not all arrive at the same time, but he totally ignored us until the last member had taken her seat. The early birds had been parched for 20 minutes before he asked about drinks, including ice water. The \"hot water\" machine was not working, so no tea. Since a \"machine\" broke, there was no way for the kitchen to make tea or any hot beverage. Ok, whatever. 

After he thought it would be okay to let us order drinks we waited about 10 minutes to get our complicated order of waters, an iced tea, a glass or two of wine and bottle beers. The waters were only occasionally refilled. Another 25+ minute wait and he asked us for dinner orders. These went off fairly well, but when communicating to my waiter (fluent English speaker), I couldn't help but get the idea he wasn't really sure wtf he was supposed to do next. What he did do next was ignore us and our water needs (I was really thirsty, OK?) while the matre 'd (wearing apparently his formal kelly green Hollister t-shirt) sat him more tables. Our food came out over about 20 minutes, which is a huge pet peeve of mine, but I do understand it is different when there is a large group. 

I am all about the final analysis: I will put up with a lot if the food is good. The food did not save this one. The food was bad, which is worse than not good. They start you off with what seems to me to be fresh or recently baked focaccia bread, sans tomatoes. They serve it with olive oil and parm. It was not great bread, cheese, or oil, but it was the highlight of the meal. We ordered the spanakopita appetizer, which for $6 or $7 consisted of 4 small, slightly burnt triangles with 4 slices of tomato. The spanakopitas themselves were devoid of flavor. The tzatziki sauce accompanying was also perfectly flavorless. It is like they just forgot a step, twice. My entree was the Moussaka, which wasn't nearly as good as I've had at other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants (I am aware that there are many ways to make this dish, but the one Istanbul employs isn't one of the good ways). The lady had the Pastitsio, which is more or less a baked ziti with custard on top and eggplant and peppers throughout. Interesting idea, but the reality was less appetizing than it looked, which was bugly.

The best thing I can say about the food is that their portions on most entrees (but not a friend's falafel platter) are generous. Now I have shitty food in my fridge to take to work for lunch tomorrow. Awesome.

Lastly, the prices were really pretty high. I figure that a decent (not nice) dinner for 2, maybe an app and 2x glasses of wine or beer plus tip should be had in CU for $50, or maybe a few bucks more if the wine is expensive. This place is more expensive than that."}
