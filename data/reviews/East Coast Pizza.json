{"text":"I'm sad to have to give this place a low rating, because the pizza smelled really good. We got a 16 in. Boston Garden Pizza and garlic knots. The pizza was, well, average at best. Nothing special, though.

The garlic knots are what brought my whole opinion of the place down. They didn't look fresh. They didn't taste fresh. The one I ate was chewy in a bad way... just not appetizing at all. (Especially for an appetizer. Hehe! Yeah, that was bad.)

Anyway, what I had was definitely not 25 dollars worth of pizza."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! The owner is very nice, the crust was great, but the pizza was so soggy. I'm sure the canned mushrooms and pale pink tomatoes contributed."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for a large pizza, wings and garlic knots. Called in for pickup and arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes later  like I was told. The place is on Ft. Apache  & Sahara, in the Target shopping center (but on Ft Apache). I walked in, wasn't greeted by anyone so I asked the two women who were hovering near the cash register if they worked there. One replied, \"yes, but I'm not clocked-in yet.\" Then more silence. I told them I was there for a pickup and the other woman (who apparently was clocked in but couldn't bother saying hello when I walked in) told me the pizza wasn't ready. I took a seat and caught some basketball on TV (they have a few) while I waited. 

The guy making the pizzas came over to me a few minutes later and handed me my order. He was super friendly but, for some reason, him handing me my food freaked out the woman behind the register. \"She hasn't paid!,\" she yelled from across the room. Yeah, I hadn't. May have had something to do with the fact that I was greeted with silence when I walked in and then again after I asked, and was told, my food wasn't ready. Upon hearing her yell, some of the patrons at nearby tables looked at me like I was about to grab my pizza and run. I wasn't. Seriously embarrassing. 

I walked over, paid, said thank you to the pizza maker (who remained friendly), then left. 

So, as far as experience/service, it was horrible. As far as the food goes, wings were tasty. They were breaded (which I didn't expect) then fried then tossed in sauce. Garlic knots were slightly dry, probably in the oven a minute too long. The pizza (half cheese, half pepperoni) was huge. Big slices and real \"east coast style.\" It was good. Not extraordinary. 

Will I be back? Highly unlikely. While the pizza was tasty, it wasn't exceptional and definitely can't compensate for the poor service. If you do decide to try it, the place lets you bring in your own beer/wine."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here on a whim because of the reviews. #2 worst pizza I've ever had. I've had $5 Hot-N-Ready pizzas from Little Cesar's that were better! The crust was stale, the cheese tasted like it was from Aldi and I'm fairly certain they used marinara instead of pizza sauce. Delivery was also a little late."}
{"text":"On the East Coast, an idiotic race exists among pizza parlors to advertise themselves as having NY-style pizza. What the hell does that mean? Ever had a pizza in NY? Most of them are greasy, awful slivers of dough crust with minimal sauce and too much cheese, so the cheese slides off in mouth-searing clumps. Not really something you want to mimic or claim to match.

But out West in Las Vegas, there seem to be a few pizza restaurants claiming they make their pizza East Coast style. This usually means a thick doughy crust as a pizza handle to eat with and a thin, doughy base to the pie. Add a small layer of sauce and gooey cheese.

So last night, we ordered a large pie (half plain, half mushroom) from a place called East Coast Pizza, which claims to make Boston-style pizza.

Claims of making a specific East Coast city-style pizza aside, their pizza is pretty tasty. The cheese wasn't slathered on in nasty clumps and the sauce was plain, but done well. All in all, not a bad pizza. And, unlike most East Coast pizza places, the mushrooms on the pizza were fresh and tasty instead of nasty and canned."}
{"text":"Ok, if you live on the East Side then choosing a pizza place can be a bit of a difficult decision.  But after trying a slice of East Coast Pizza, you will no longer have to decide.  This place may be the best pizzeria on the East Side, maybe all of Northeast Ohio.  It's not simply the addictive nature of the pizza; sauce, cheese, toppings, crust, but it's the freshness of the ingredients and the love of the owner.  When you walk in you will be greeted by Gus,  who is very kind and cheerful and always makes you feel welcome.  Let me tell you, Gus can make a pizza beyond belief.  A typical order usually takes only 10-15 minutes, and is ready for pickup or delivery.  If you are looking for a GREAT pizza with fresh ingredients and undeniable taste, then you've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Loveeee this place. Homey hole-in-the-wall family run pizzeria. 

First time I had East Coast's was when my roommate brought back the meat lover on his way back from work. Our heater was still broken, I was hungry and cold, and when I bit into the hot cheesy meaty goodness I actually had goosebumps run down my arms and back. East Coast's Pizza isn't a fancy brick-oven pizza with ingredients shipped from all corners of the earth. This is comfort food pizza at its finest, it is pizza you eat when you are cozying up on a Saturday night watching the game. 

It has become my local go to. Me and my buddies love their hawaiian, meatlovers (of course), and supreme pizza; It's become tradition for us to order all three for the Super Bowl every year, never disappointed. Craving some serious comfort food? They have it all: mozzarella sticks, buffalo wings, garlic rolls, and a really good cheese steak.

The owner Gus is a very nice man, and always greats us with a warm welcome and big smile when we come in. I normally don't eat vegetarian anything, but upon his recommendation, I tried the cucumber hummus sandwich.. amazing. Seriously some of the best hummus I've ever had, and the little thing was packed with so much flavor too! Highly recommended. 

With everything made from scratch at this family-run business, East Coast Pizza has all it takes to satisfy your pizza cravings at a very affordable price. A local gem and a personal favorite"}
{"text":"I would've loved to try East Coast... but after waiting 5 minutes on hold, while listening to him banging stuff around, he came back to the phone and asked how can I help you, so I stated \"I'd like to place an order for pick up\" and his reply was a long sigh and a very irritated \"What would you like\". So I said nevermind, and hung up.  

It's a shame.  With all the other options out there, I chose to support a non corporate establishment.  But clearly my business is not wanted.  Marcos it is."}
{"text":"Ok.  So I was a little scared to go in by myself.  However, the owner was lovely and very nice.  He even gave my daughter a sucker.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good their pizza was.  Thin crispy crust and delicious toppings.  A winner!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  Just enough spice in the sauce. Good prices.  Very small shop, glad i went during the day or i would of missed it"}
{"text":"My go to place. Definitely the best pizza place in Garfield Hts, and there is a lot of pizza places here. The pizza is usually done in just 10-15 minutes. It's always good, hot and fresh. Seriously some of the best pizza. If you haven't had it yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Garfield Heights. If I was ranking it against any pizza I've ever had, it might not do quite as well, but pizza is often a quick, easy solution and East Coast delivers tasty pies with a great crust right here in town. It's my go-to place!!"}
