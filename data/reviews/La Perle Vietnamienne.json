{"text":"Un excellent service et un accueil des plus chaleureuse. Les mets sont succulents en plus d'être a un prix plus que respectables!! Toujours un plaisir que d'aller manger a ce restaurant."}
{"text":"The owner is the bald Asian guy at the cash register who talks bad about his customers right in their face in another language and thinks we didnt understand. Very rude. Very disrespectful. He says he's specialized in Vietnamese food yet they can't make a decent soup.. The worst tokinoise soup in Canada. His general Tao is fried, over cooked and has no taste. Their grilled meats are okay but they are served thin as paper so you can't notice its not the best choice cuts available. The restaurant is in dire need of renovations. This place is open for his Lexus payments and could care less about what he serves and who it goes to. A total loser."}
{"text":"This was the first time I go there to eat because usually I just grab take out. The place is nice and clean so that is always a plus. Nothing too fancy and it is nice because you can being your own wine. The service was a bit slow and the waiter was very friendly to the regular but with us pretty flat. The food is good but nothing special and it is pretty pricey. The best time to go it's Tuesday because it is buy one plate and the the other one 50% off so it is worth it. If in the area again I might go back but will not go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"The service was so good here !   The food was well priced and very tasty ! I got the mixed chicken & shrimp vermicelli plate, comes with spring rolls and soup.   Large meal & BYOB for a very decent price  Would go back & would recommend ."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant vietnamien, sans plus. Ce situe dans la moyenne. On y retrouve les même plats et combinaison."}
{"text":"I was surprised ! The food is very tasty. We tool a combination plate (beef , shrimp, rice, salad and spring roll) to be honest i liked everything. I cannot comment alit on service, the restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived  but was full before we left, the waitress was always smiling and very helpful, food came fast and vey well presented.  (Not the top in his style of food but definitely not like those all you can eat buffet or fast food Chinese). I  don't know how diverse is their regular menu , buy from my experience i would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for this place that magically disappeared.  Went in a few months back and took some take-out. It wasn't very good.  Service was OK, price tag was too expensive for what it's worth."}
