{"text":"This place is a small but wonderful place to be! Great customer service. Local Arizona beer that is always changing. A great wine selection and amazing food. The burrata cheese board is amazing and their paninis are delicious! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Best service and atmosphere hidden away in Old Town! Really good setup when it comes to Sunday morning drinks and football, can't forget about the Sunday Ticket! Management is very accommodating and always encourage trying new beers. I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"A friend and I were walking back to our hotel after dinner and happened to pass by this bar. The quaint alley seating with overhead vines and lights drew us in, and we were glad to have stopped! The waitress was knowledgeable and friendly, and recommended the Vines & Hops house wine flight, which had two nice reds and the most delicious sauvignon blanc I've ever tasted. I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came here for wine tasting and had a wonderful experience. We ordered some food, bought a wine bottle and their non-alcoholic beer to go!"}
{"text":"Awesome wine and beer bar. Friendly owners, great selection of wines and local beers, food is delicious. I've been there a few times and sent friends their way. Everybody really likes this place. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"What a great spot! 18 taps and dozens of bottles/cans, ALL Arizona beers, not to mention tons of wine and good small plates, salads, and sandwiches. Chad is a good dude and this place will take off. Stop in to see him!"}
{"text":"The owners are fantastic and always willing to accommodate large groups if they can. Great beer, great wine, and great food. I love their paninis!! But I hate that computerized menu.  I highly recommend this small, local joint to anyone."}
{"text":"Great little wine/ beer bar off the beaten track (means away from the Scottsdale \"bar\" seen but still ealing distance from old town.  Great people, wines, AZ beer taps, music.   Will def be back ... A LOT"}
{"text":"We are from Wisconsin and wanted a nice place to drink some wine and beer (for the ladies and the men) and found this little gem. What a GREAT place! Truly a place to visit in Scottsdale.   Great people, wine, beer and conversations, see you again some day Vines and Hops!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Get here now. Wine flights, great food pairings, an awesome ambiance and very friendly owners! The new up and coming hotspot of Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a very cozy wine bar with excellent food, drinks, music and artwork.  Such an amazing place!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Amazing selection of both wines and beer, and an incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff. Felt like we were walking into a room of old friends.  We stopped in for a drink before New Year's Eve dinner, and based on the experience, plan on coming later tonight!"}
{"text":"When you can't decide between a great IPA or a rich Cab, go get both at Vines and Hops!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for \"dinner\" one night. My husband enjoyed the beer while I had wine. We had wanted to get salads that we had seen on the website menu but found they know longer served them. Got the antipasto plate & the meat & cheese plate (only difference between the 2 was swapping cheese for the veggies). We had an enjoyable evening chatting with the bartenders and others who were there."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great owners. Wine and beer afficionados. Super passionate about their craft. I tried the red wine flight - fantastic. Great time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Orange County and found this place on yelp. Good wine selection. Nice atmosphere. Staff was incredibly friendly. Would definitely come here again.  We got the cooper & thief and force of nature wines, both were excellent. Cooper & thief was oaky with a clean finish, very unique taste."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Loved trting out the different beer and wine. Incredible selection!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first stop on the bike tour! The staff at Vines and Hops were friendly and the bubbles were fabulous! The rest of our group had several of the local brews... Cute little space in Old Town!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous wine and beer bar in the heart of downtown Scottsdale!  I'm from out of town and stumbled upon this place but while looking for a bite to eat and a nice glass of wine with my Aunt.   Shared an incredible starter plate of pesto, burrata cheese and crostini, then moved on to one of the best vegetable paninis I've ever had. The wine selection is unique and top notch and I love that you can buy a bottle right there if there's something you really like. Great Arizona beer selection as well. Love the ambiance with the indoor, outdoor seating and love that there's a water bowl for dogs outside.   Super friendly and knowledgeable staff too.  What a find!"}
{"text":"During our vacation in Arizona, we stopped in Old Town Scottsdale. Per the top reviews on Yelp, we decided to visit Vines & Hops. My bf and I were very impressed!   Chad was our bartender and was friendly and helpful. His suggestions were great.   I chose the wine flight and my bf got the beer flight.  Being from the Bay Area, I wanted to try AZ wines to compare. The Pinot noir was amazing! I really enjoyed it...more than a lot of other CA pinots I've had.   The beer flight was exceptionally good. Our favorite was the Huss-Koffee Kolch. It was so delicious! Second was the Sonoran-White Chocolate - surprisingly yummy and refreshing.   The atmosphere at Vines & Hops is modern, clean, comfortable, and welcoming.   Definitely recommend whether you live in Scottsdale or are visiting!"}
{"text":"Best bar for our go to place! Great tasting beers and wine! We'll be back! Mary and I had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Cute little place in old town! Great for a date night! Only complaint is the menu is on a small iPad and seems less personal. When two of us were trying to read the menu it was a little hard."}
{"text":"Make sure you try the wine flight! Great way to decide your next glass... Also get the breads and spreads with a combo meat and cheese spread"}
{"text":"Stopped by after an evening bike ride. Beer choices were great, food over priced for portion size. Bartenders cared more about closing down the place to drink elsewhere than tend to customers in the bar."}
{"text":"Great people and delicious wine. Very relaxed setting. Food was outstanding. 70 wines to choose from."}
{"text":"Wow, I feel lucky Yelp led me to this place. I stopped in here on my only night in Scottsdale, and it was a two minute walk from my hotel which made it extra appealing. Right from when I walked in, the friendly staff greeted me and I knew this was going to be a good place. Their beer selections are incredible, and I choose a cider beer on tap (my all-time favorite tap choice). When I went to order food, I went with the burrata (less the sauce) and was super impressed. Everything was top-notch and this place will do well."}
{"text":"Cool little spot....came upon it by accident.  Great concept and would be a go to place for me aside from one key thing.....The only time I've ever had a wine pour that small was wine tasting in Napa.   The glass of red was only 10$....but should be more than what appeared to be WELL under 6 oz!   Judging from the pour, I imagine they could have gotten 6-7 glasses from that bottle.....not a plus!  One other thing but not a big deal.....dim the ceiling lights like the bar lights are.....ambiance would even be better.   Nice spot though."}
{"text":"Walked in to this bar at 3 in the afternoon. The owner and I sat there and shot the shit over a couple pints. Great selection of local micros as well as a few national brews. Great stop. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is why I love Yelp - I would have never encountered Vines & Hops without it! This cozy wine/beer bar is tucked in a quiet side street in Old Town Scottsdale. I came with a friend around 930 on a Saturday night. We were quickly greeted with one of their tablet menus, which was a fun technological twist! The wine and beer lists were extensive, with plenty of local Arizona choices as well as other locations.   We both chose the Arizona wine flight - three, 3oz pours of your choice of any Arizona based wines. Our favorite was actually the Vines & Hops House Sauvignon blanc!   The service was great. We were checked up on often and our empty wine flight glasses were picked up within minutes of finishing.   While we didn't try any food on this visit, the menu looked delicious! I will definitely be back soon to partake in a panini or charcuterie board."}
{"text":"What a nice treat!  I had wine and my husband did the beer.  I felt like I was at a special wine tasting!  Go!"}
{"text":"Nice, if small, beer selection and very friendly owners. It was an insanely hot AZ summer day outside and walking into this cool (literally) little place was the perfect stop. They're dog friendly as well, right down to having \"dog beer\" available sometimes."}
{"text":"A great place to visit for wine and local craft beers. Great apps too. A must visit...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped n here while on a bike ride in Scottsdale.  What a great find!!!  The beer flights are the way to go.  Got to taste 10 beers between the 2 of us.  Owner suggested mixing the Blueberry Beer with the Chocolate beer an it was amazing!!!  Also ate a grilled sandwich with fig jam and cheese.   That was something I will probably dream about tonight.  Delicious!!  The owners are delightful and we really enjoyed talking with them while we tasted our selections.  This is a place that we will return to!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food here was pretty legit... we ordered from the nibbles and platters menu and found a great value for the serving size, the wine flights were $2 off on happy hour so it was actually a nice deal. The service was maybe a little sub par for a slow Sunday evening, but it wasn't unbearable since they have games entertainment in the dart room  Apparently this is a newer family run business and the servers might be a little less experienced, but honestly it would have been perfectly fine if the server didn't apologize profusely for the wait every time he came to the table. Overall, I'll be giving this place their first imperfect review since many of the other reviews are likely to have come from friends and family however, I would recommend this place as a decent hidden nugget, but 4/5 stars because I think there's definitely room for improvement from a service standpoint."}
{"text":"Always have a great selection of locally brewed craft beers and switch out their menu regularly. Great customer service and a very nice, dog friendly patio and even offer non-alcoholic dog beer. Always enjoy coming to Vines and Hops and recommend them to locals and out-of-town guests"}
{"text":"they have a huge local beer and wine list!! The owners are knowledgeable, helpful, and there a great atmosphere. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to tell people about this secluded spot so I can keep it all to myself! But, I suppose I should share the news. This quaint, high-tech, dog-friendly establishment is a great place to come in with a small/medium size group and enjoy some wine or beer flights paired with some classy apps or sandwiches. We stayed for a couple hours and sipped on our drinks and played darts in the side room. The staff was attentive and helped us choose a greatly priced bottle of champagne. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere that's a bit disconnected from the typical old town bars and restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped by Vines & Hops on a Thursday evening during happy hour. I have ordered the prosciutto and Brie plate and it was a little pricey for what it was worth. Great selection of wines and beers. The place is small so it might not be the perfect spot for a large gathering or group. We sat on the patio and our doggie had a yummy dog cookie treat."}
{"text":"Went on a groupon...and loved this place.  Awesome local beer and wine...awesome antipasto .  Service was also great. Loved the ambiance and paintings by local artists."}
{"text":"First time for Lisa and I ;  great wine and Antipasto platter had good conversation with Chad the owner.We'llbe back !!!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternative for a classier Old Town Scottsdale vibe when you don't want to get trashed at Whiskey Row.   We came on a Saturday night. Unlike a lot of Old Town, parking on the street was more than spacious. The joint itself isn't that big, with mostly bar seating, but there were a couple tables of 8 that were free and fit our group. They had a dart board set up and some pretty neat paintings. If you want something to play, you can get hooked up with their board game closet, with mostly classic staples like Risk, Monopoly, Uno, or even Jenga.   I'm a big fan of the space - good uses of blue, blacks, and whites making it seem very chic. The tablet menus were a nice touch if you're into that green scene. You got your typical bar tapas, but there's also sandwiches and even brunch options. Keep in mind I think the kitchen closes around 9 if you intended on staying late, but even then we still got offered a bowl of olives or nuts if we really needed something.  The menu for alcohol was impressive. Mostly wine and beers as you'd expect, but I was surprised they even had 5 meads. I got a sampler of 1.5 ounces of 3 for $15, and while some were more liked than others, they were all solid pickings and could hold their own as a glass.  Even in a large group, they checked in on us relatively frequently if we wanted more to drink, and refilled our group's bottles of water plenty of times. That being said, there was a great rapport between the bar staff and the lone drinkers and couples at the bar. I find myself just as likely returning solo as with a group, but either way I see myself coming back soon."}
{"text":"We had a great time at vine and hops last night. The owner was behind the bar serving us and he was so attentive and accommodating. We found this little gem using Groupon and are so glad we did! We live in the area and can't wait to go back! If you like off the wall beers and speciality wines this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp. They had a good selection of local draft beers to choose from. My wife, not a beer drinker, had a grapefruit mimosa, she enjoyed it. The service was VERY good, very friendly. We sat on their patio, a little small, but quite nice and peaceful. The place was kinda busy, and very clean. They had tablets at the tables to help with your ordering of wine and food. We went inside to try a couple drafts before ordering. Very nice place."}
{"text":"This is a new, sharp-looking bar with an excellent wine and food selection and a friendly, laid-back feel. It's down a quiet street but worth the search. They also sell wine by the bottle. They also have a private dining area."}
{"text":"This is review is WAY overdue. My boyfriend and I were in Scottsdale for vacation over the New Years weekend. We found a Groupon for 2 flights and 2 pints, so we checked it out. THE BEST. I wish this place was closer to where we live. The service was phenomenal, beer was delicious - they have a wide variety and excellent options. We like the place SO much that we decided to spend out NYE there. Best choice. There was only a handful of us, hanging out, playing games and drinking. Even got complimentary champagne at midnight for a toast with everyone. Absolutely loved this place and would HIGHLY recommend to anyone visiting or living in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly but seems very busy. They didn't seem very talkative and not very patient. Please note the use of the word \"very\". The service was fine, just not great. My server was not very knowledgeable about the Malbecs they had on the menu. So I had to try a couple. I was a little disappointed that she didn't know anything about the wine, but still enjoyed the show place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Tom is fantastic and Chad is just as amazing. We came in here to redeem our Groupon and ended up not being able to drink the two free pints so they gave us a business card and told us to come in whenever and we could redeem our free pints. We came in three days later and they remembered us and gave us our drinks. Wonderful bartenders and great service. Both human and dog friendly!! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This spot makes me happy! Super chill. Simple but nice decor. We just stopped by for a drink so no food review. The bartender was super nice. There were so many good looking beers that we had a tough time deciding, but I never felt rushed and he was happy to answer questions and talk about the beers. I did browse the wine list which looked quite good as well. We wound up settling on doing flights. I love that you can pick whatever you want for a flight and you write it down so you can actually remember what you're drinking. They had some great beers and all the draft beers were AZ brewed which is awesome. They sell dog beer which is super cute! Definitely would love to bring the pup here!"}
{"text":"Visited this spot twice while by boyfriend and I were in Scottsdale over the holiday weekend. Very cool atmosphere, great selection and very helpful and personable owners. We tried a few wines and beer during our two visits and everything was delicious. Really enjoyed the drink and conversation. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great wine & beer establishment in Old Town Scottsdale but just out if the way enough you feel it's your local place. Awesome selection of local bees & wine. Really good nibbles too!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Sunday, the staff was friendly and helpful in our selection. Very generous pours as well. They rotate their selection frequently and have a chill vibe overall. Boast that they are dog friendly so major bonus points there!"}
{"text":"Best hometown bar in the Old Town area. Great prices, great atmosphere, and the beer was phenomenal. Try the Sonoran White Chocolate! My new favorite in the Valley. MUST TRY BAR!"}
{"text":"What a great spot!!!!! Chad was so helpful in helping us find a glass of wine and even kept sending over samples of all of their local beers.  They have over 40 wines by the glass and one of them being Prisoner which is one of my all time favorites.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place! 20 beers on tap all local.  70+ wines by the glass. Food was awesome and so was the service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor. Drinks/food were great. . It's nice to see a local establishment serving local tap beer and wine. Thanks and all the best!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by this place due to the yelp check in deal: 50% off anything?! The funny part was that I didn't even use it because their house red blend is their very own wine and only $4 on happy hour. The bartender egged me to save it for another time.   I enjoy the cool air during these hot summer months and that they give. It's a place with natural light, gorgeous dark wood, and an urban-style bar. I think this is the perfect place to bring a client as the music and chatter is not awfully loud. It's intimate but it's not necessarily \"romantic\" unless your company makes it as such.   The food looked delicious and was very appropriately priced. For being in Old Town Scottsdale, it was a great deal!   They often have tap takeovers and an arsenal of craft beer so all will be satisfied. I did not see any liquor however, so save this for those that enjoy the fine wine and craft beer."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Love the choice of wine flights and selection of small plates. Nice atmosphere. Owners and staff very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tommy was amazing!   What a down to earth guy with such a fun laugh to boot!   We really had fun trying out the flights of wine and beer.   The food was delicious as well!   We would have stayed longer,  but we had to drive home... Lol"}
{"text":"Great hidden spot. Courtney was awesome and knowledgeable about the beer and local Scottsdale. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great atmosphere. People here are attentive and show genuine interest in your needs. Not the biggest of place, but that's fine cause the charm makes it a Must come type of place!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, good service, great wine & beer selection. As a beer snob I was happy to see that there was a great selection of local craft beers. The food was delicious however it was more happy hour snack food then a dinner menu, which is of course all good when you have good service, good wine & beer selection and a great atmosphere! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little place, lots of local beers, good wine selection, patio is small but adequate. Staff very friendly and attentive.  Enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"I heard about this new place through Yelp, so we decided to stop in before heading out to dinner.  I absolutely loved it - great vibe with fantastic art, amazingly friendly owners, and super extensive wine and beer list...so hard to decide what to try!  We settled on a rose and a cabernet sauvignon flight - great way to try 3 different wines and decide what to have a glass of next time.  We'll definitely be back and intend to bring our pup next time...who will also enjoy the dog beer - so cool!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Great atmosphere, very clean and spacious with reasonably priced alcohol.  Dropped by here late at night after eating and drinking already. We went with a big group to play (board) games because we wouldn't fit in anyone's place. Even though the place is just off the main street, it's in kind of a dark area which might be why there weren't that many people in there. My friend had called ahead and set asked for a table for ten. When we got there they were extra friendly and led us to a separate room with two long tables. Only half of the group was there at the time, so I felt kind of bad for taking up the whole room. We sat down and got to playing games. The server told us that they also had games too if wanted to play any of theirs. At that point a few servers were milling about offering us menus and asking for our orders.  I ordered a red wine flight which was actually really good even though it was only $12 and the BF ordered a beer on tap. Only about half the table ordered because we'd all eaten already and some people didn't really drink. I kind of felt bad, especially since they kept coming back to ask us if we wanted anything else. I felt bad that our group didn't order more but I didn't really want to over order just to carry the table especially since I was already very full at that point. I considered getting another wine flight but I ended up drinking mine so slowly that I didn't finish it till we were almost about to leave :P. Either way the situation was a little bit awkward.   I think over pressured us a little to order, especially since we weren't really taking up space that was needed for other customers. I think the expectation they had for us was a little high. In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have called ahead and just showed up. Even though they were being a little pushy, they didn't ever get too rude so overall I still liked the place. I'd probably want to go back again next time I'm in town and try the food or get more drinks."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! They serve delicious and unique beers from around Arizona- which is great as an out-of-towner so I can taste a variety of drinks without the travel! Also had the \"Spanish\" panini which was to die for! There is a long wine list for non beer drinkers as well! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My son and I were looking for a different beer bar. This one had pretty good reviews and ended up having AZ breweries on tap. The server was able to recommend some good choices for us. The beer was fresh and cold, just like it should be. The beer list seemed about 30 point with many different styles represented. I'm not big on wine but that too was a hefty list. Place was quiet. Good for a date with some appetizers."}
{"text":"Great little place!  Hard to find, but worth the effort for a great menu, really friendly staff and an intimate environment."}
{"text":"Great little place to have a glass of wine or beer bartender and service super friendly!"}
{"text":"They have \"beer\" for your dog!  Classy but casual.  Quality food but not overpriced.  Friendly and funny staff.  I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this small, friendly beer and wine bar. Tucked off Brown, just east of Scottsdale Road. Impressive beer and wine list with lots of Arizona options. Several wine flight options with various themes by style or location. Our server made great recommendations, with the help of the sommelier/bartender. I had a wonderful dry rosé and the fume blanc, and my boyfriend loved his Australian red flight. Menu of sandwiches and appetizers that pair well with wine. We put together a great charcuterie board - you can select from several meat and cheese options. TVs throughout the bar but not too loud or distracting. Just a laid back, friendly neighborhood spot. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Best wine bar ever!!! you'll never disappointed. They have the Best wines and so many of them. Their craft beers are all so different whether you like a peanut butter Porter or a coffee Stout. There's definitely something for every kind of beer pallet. There cheese and meat plate look so beautiful you don't even want to eat them, but  when you do they  are really good. The people that own and work there are the reason that everybody comes back there they couldn't be any nicer and more accommodating. We will be going there for many years to come"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my time here. Great ownership that is very friendly and welcoming. Definitely a go to spot in Downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very friendly, helpful staff. Nice selection of local beers, large selection of wines. Good appetizers for munching. Dog friendly, they even have beer for dogs. They offer military discount. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We couldn't be happier that we stumbled upon this gem during our trip! They have a great check in offer with yelp and we got our first glasses of wine 50% off. They also have happy hour specials every day of the week essentially all day that are phenomenal! We tried the veggie sandwich (phenomenal), turkey club, and hummus boards. The staff were attentive and so friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for some beer and wine and enjoyed this place. I was not overly thrilled with the current double IPA but it was a nice place to check out while in town. We didn't have food."}
{"text":"Talk about dog friendly!!!! Alley was greeted with a treat and a water bowl with ice cold water!  She even got a dog beer....the one speciality made in house.  The owners take dog friendly to the next level.  They even have their dogs on the dog beer label.    The set is very clean and the decor is nice.  It's a comfortable, friendly environment I could drink all afternoon in.  We sat outside so Alley could enjoy the the birds and beautiful patio. The inside was nice as well but we liked the over hanging vines and shade offered outside.    Vine and hops outs family owned and when I left I felt like part of the family.  Everyone spent a lot of time with is talking beer.  They do not brew there own beers but,  the local beers they chose were all great.  I usually don't  stay at beer establishments that don't brew there own beers, but this place has changed my perspective.  Like I said, all the beers were great and tasty.  The flight was aesthetically pleasing and large.  I have nothing bad top day about this establishment.  If you are looking for great local Arizona beer and great people vines and hops should be you next stop.  On a side note,  they will be getting beer from Iron John soon.  Try it. Best brewery ever!!!"}
{"text":"So one of my favorite things to do is wander through the streets of downtown Scottsdale.  Sometimes it's fun to go off the beaten path and see what this little gem of a town has to offer.  This is how we stumbled upon Vines and Hops.  It was about 8 pm on a Wednesday and the place was pretty quiet but we decided to try a couple of wine flights.  The bartender was extremely helpful in getting us started.  I love the way they have their flights organized.  You don't just choose random wines, they have them sorted into different categories so each go together.  I chose the white flight and my husband chose the Italian flight.  The bar is nice and clean but we opted to take our vino out to the quiet and quaint patio.  The vine covered patio is absolutely lovely for relaxing!  It was such a quiet night in Scottsdale which is just what my hubby and I were looking for this particular evening.  We really enjoyed our wine tasting here, I even found a new wine that might be a new favorite!  Looking forward to purchasing a bottle. They offer beer flights as well and their pricing seems reasonable. A fun experience in Scottsdale!  The whole staff was welcoming and helpful and we really enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place in old town, great new bar away from the Scottsdale scene where you can enjoy great local beers. Amazing staff, with a great bartender!"}
{"text":"Prestige wine bar with a relaxing atmosphere with a chill vibe. Nice inside and out. Patio is great for Arizona weather as it it shaded most the day. Best selection of wine in Arizona, always great selection craft beer as well. Don't forget to check out the food menu. You won't be disappointed. Most visit to appreciate."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised. For being so close to old town Scottsdale, there was ample parking. That made it easy to take a walk after drinks and people watch.  Vines and hops is a small bar that has a great variety of beers and wines. It is very clean with trendy/slightly modern decor. I would say you could wear anything from dress up to casual. The bartenders were knowledgable and gave perfect recommendations. It was quiet and not overpacked like most other bars in old town. They also have a quaint outdoor patio, although in the summer I'm sure it'll be too hot to sit outside. Perfect for spring weather though."}
{"text":"We love this spot. The owners are amazing and the place itself is adorable. Drinks are great. We went once back in Octoberish and just stopped in again a couple of weeks ago - owner remembered us by name. Awesome spot, good vibe. Will keep going back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , great beer, and even better service!!! This is a new place in Scottsdale and I couldn't say more amazing things about it. They have a great selection of beer, wine and food."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! Loved this place! Found it on Groupon and it was a treat! The staff was amazing and the wine was great! They also have 19 local beers on tap and I can't wait to try some of those! Will most definitely Be back !"}
{"text":"Impossible not to walk out of this place without a new favorite drink. Mine? BEAST double IPA. Should come with a warning label - like, pace yourself if you're a lightweight.   PS this place has food. My friend still talks about the olives (I'm not an olive person) but apparently the olives are the ish."}
{"text":"Vines and Hops is a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale! I found it on Yelp when looking for a casual wine and craft beer bar and have been going back regularly ever since. They have a huge selection of wine and beer and will let you taste anything before buying. Recently they've added quite a few food selections which have all been really good. The owners are very involved and have been there every single time I've gone. They, along with the rest of the staff, are personable and knowledgeable about the menu. Additionally, Vines and Hops is extremely dog friendly. They have a cute side patio where I've sat outside with my dog and she loved all the attention. They sell \"Dog Beer\" (meat juice) which she went crazy over. This is an ideal spot in Old Town that's walking distance from all the restaurants/bars/shops etc. and is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love thia new spot in old town. Great wine selection and a bunch of rotating  local brews on tap. Chad and Tom are great guys! Ask them for a recommendation. they wont ateer you wrong. A must try when you're in the area. looking forward to trying some charcuterie from Chef Hunter soon! Grear job Vines and Hops!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place on a Sunday and we are SO happy we did. Great place to get delicious wines and refreshing beers. Owned by husband and wife who are very personable. If you are in the neighborhood, great place to check out."}
{"text":"Hidden in Old Town, this place has a wonderful selection of beers on tap as well as wines by the glass. I recommend coming here and getting a couple of flights and don't forget to bring your four-legged friend too! My pup, Ollie loved his doggie biscuits and we enjoyed everything about this quaint little patio and can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Seattle WA and this place reminds me of the city. This is fun, quaint and I absolutely loved it! Great atmosphere, great service and great drinks! I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a large group of friends. Small space but they made it work. Super helpful and friendly crew there and the wine list is great. Worked well since it caters to both the Wine and beer crowd. The appetizer with Burrata and pesto was amazing. Will definitely go again and highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Beer and wine place specializing in local stuff.  Appetizer size food.  Lots of discounts (happy hour 4-6, veterans discount, etc.).  Super friendly staff.  We tried the Four Peaks ale and some kind of Saison and both were excellent.  I mean really really good.    Menu consists of apps (the meat and cheese plate looked good and so did the hummus.  Owner said they will be serving personal pizzas in the near future.  Location is a bit off of Scottsdale Rd but still close.  I just stumbled across it on my run from nearby hotel.  OK - Five stars because of friendly staff, good prices and selection.  This is my new favorite bar in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, they accommodated us well! We had 4 different flights and it was perfect for tasting  Good atmosphere also"}
{"text":"This place has a very warm and hearty atmosphere. Tons of amazing local beers and amazing selection of wine. Definitely must visit!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot in Scottsdale which is dog friendly.  In fact, they provided a bowl and doggie treat without even having to asked.  Our server was a jovial fellow who was well informed on the menu and paid attention to our dog's needs.  Dogs are allowed on the outdoor patio.  The patio is shaded, but it would be nice to have a fan or misters.  The food was good and at a reasonable price point. The grilled cheese was grilled to perfection with tomatoes and peppers. The chips were crisp.  The burrata appetizer was large and easily enough for two people.  The cheese and balsamic were a smooth combination.  The beer and wine list is vast and varied.  There are a nice selection of AZ beers."}
{"text":"Friendly owners, beer and wine very tasty! All in all very good! I would highly recommend, atmosphere super chill."}
{"text":"20 beers on draft and another 40 in cans/bottles which is cool, but most of which are average beers. Didnt eat but the food menu l"}
{"text":"I checked out Vines & Hops in late September for their Tuesday all-day happy hour ! I started with a pinot noir flight and then switched to a cabernet. Both the bartenders were super helpful; you can tell they are passionate about wine and finding the right wine for everyone that comes in! One bartender helped my friend find the perfect sweet wine (we were surprised it was a red!). And the other, created a mini tasting to help me pick which cabernet I wanted a glass of. I want to come back to try a beer flight in the future (they are only $5 on happy hour!)"}
{"text":"I will echo what others have said - a bit off the beaten path which is perfect. Exceptional beer selection - one of the most diverse I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot. You'll be taken care of by the owners themselves- excellent service. A great place well worth spending time at."}
{"text":"I love coming in to vines & hops. The staff is ALWAYS tentative. This was my first time coming in, but I will absolutely be back. It is very clean, very friendly, and did I mention GREAT beers on tap?!"}
{"text":"Great little wine and beer bar. Everyone is super nice and gave us \"out of towners\" great ideas for places to visit and eat during our stay."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer and a fabulous wine selection, food is great as well, can't say enough about this place. If you are looking for a great wine bar, look no further, this is it. And if you stop by on a Wednesday you will get a great guitar player as well. This place is all thumbs up"}
{"text":"Erica D ...bar keep etiquette training needed. Don't deliver your customer's bill before asking if they are finished and don't come collect your tips before we leave...we barely finished signing before you slammed them shut and swooped them up. Positive note: the two male employees working tonight were amazing and attentive. Overall, the food was delish and the wine was sublime, but we ultimately felt rushed."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. We rode our bikes here on Sunday morning around 11am when they opened. The place is great, TV's, a bar & tables.They have good beers to offer on tap & the wine flights are awesome. The owners are super friendly and fun to talk to. I cant wait to come back soon.  ALSO, The patio is adorable (it was a little bit cold outside on Sun) so we will have to come back & bring the dog. They even have dog beer, how cute is that!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer and wine list, and great service. Been here a handful of times and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Adorable. Sweet little place. Great food with great flavor. Fabulous fun staff. Perfect for date night."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place my wife and I stopped in prior to going to dinner ended up spending two hours there enjoyed the customer service bartenders for excellent very knowledgeable highly recommend anybody in town to check this out"}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere and a great place to try local beers. Owners are friendly and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Scottsdale.  The staff is incredibly friendly and their beer selection is on point.  If you love a good brew or glass of wine you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"While in town, the hubby and I bought a Groupon for Vine & Hops and decided to stop in.  We really loved the feel of this bar and the staff was great! So attentive and friendly! They offer many local beers and wines so there's really something for all tastes.  I had to drop one star though based on the food.  We ordered a meat and cheese plate and although you can choose your own items, which is pretty cool, it still left much to be desired.  It seemed to be just kind of thrown together and was a bit pricey for what you actually receive.  Other than that, we really enjoyed ourselves and would totally recommend checking it out.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great little beer bar/wine bar in the heart of Scottsdale.  You have to keep your eye out for it as the entry is in an alleyway.  Once you find your way in you'll locate a bar of perfect size.  Not too big, but big enough for a group.  There's a dart board in the side room and the place is clean as can be.  On draft you'll find about a dozen and a half AZ brews.  I love beer and while I appreciate our local brewers I do hope for a bit of a wider selection.  There are some canned options but their off to the side and behind the bar.  The atmosphere was non-existent but maybe I was drinking too early in the day (Me? No!  You don't say!!!).  Next time I'll come back in the evening and hopefully get the same great service with a more lively crowd."}
{"text":"Fantastic, came from out of town, and we're looking for something \"local\".  All local beers, some local wines, good food, and staff was stellar.  Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Love the vibe and the amazing people there! The food was also amazing-different cheeses and meats to pair!"}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of local beers and great wines. Non pretentious vibe with a bar, private room and chill outdoors. Locally owned and you can tell the owners really care about about their patrons and what they are serving."}
{"text":"Great bar. Great owners. Craft brews. Menu is simple, but food is solid. Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited Vines & Hops on Saturday night and were blown away. I originally found this spot through Groupon and we were excited to try it. It is tucked away and definitely a hidden gem of Old Town Scottsdale. My boyfriend did a beer flight and I did a wine flight. We both loved every beer and wine we chose to test. The service was great and the staff did an awesome job of explaining each beer and wine. We also sampled the meat and cheese plate, which we loved, as well. We will definitely be back as the food, service, and drinks were all on point. Such a cool spot!"}
{"text":"My favorite local brew pub!  There is an ever changing draft beer menu, an impressive wine list, yummy sandwiches, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great selections both beer and wine.  Staff knowledgeable, interesting and fun to talk to.  Don't miss this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The owners are amazing and the selection is better than anything is Scottsdale!   You owe it to yourself to at least try it!"}
{"text":"So good! The flights are great options and the service was fantastic! We had the egg sandwich, warm cookie,chocolate flights, mead flight, all was good...although the mead was interesting:)"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 5/5 Happiness - 5/5  I found this place on the recent 50 best places in Phoenix list. And despite my skepticism, it does not disappoint. Let it be known that the location is small (about 20 seats or so?).   The wine offerings are varied and impressive. The menu is on tablets, so its really easy to get through. They also have wine flights, beer flights, and mead flights. They have a much smaller, but still good, selection of mainly local draft beers and a number of cans/bottles as needed. You can also have them freshly can beer for you  to take home (using a fun hand-cranked machine).   I ordered the bruschetta dish and it was SO GOOD. Even the bread was outstanding. It was also a generous portion (fed two of us, and we were slightly bigger guys).  But what makes this place so good is the staff. One guy who looks like Chris Pratt is particularly fun. But they all are charming and talkative (if you want to talk to them. They left the phone users in peace)."}
{"text":"Great staff and were super friendly and knowledgeable! The bartender let my friends and I try out a few different beers with samples before ordering which was great. Cute, intimate atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to friends to visit!"}
{"text":"Love this new wine bar. Tons of awesome wines by the class including Prisoner! They have $2 off during happy hour and there's a yelp deal for 50% with a check in. Come check it out before everyone finds out about this gem!"}
{"text":"Brand new locally owned wine/beer bar in Old Town! Superb wine selection. One of the owners is an absolutely charming sommelier that can walk you through the whole menu (and even highlight a few labels where he knows the winery owners). If you love beer, stop in for a top notch AZ microbrew selection. Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only do they have excellent service, great wine, and excellent beer, they also give veterans a 10% discount and allow dogs. They have \"dog beer\" for your dogs too!!!"}
{"text":"This is an out-of-the-way place that is well worth the visit. And while the wine drinkers and beer lovers in our party found much to enjoy, we will always remember the meat and cheese plates and sandwiches. OMG, we haven't enjoyed platters like we were served since visiting Europe. And our server, Mark, was a knowledgable foodie himself. We were in heaven. This is a sophistiated, nonpretentious bar that prides itself on serving great wines, local beers and fabulous food. A one of a kind."}
{"text":"the wine glasses are rly big. The alley way tables and chairs are top notch. I have no complaints y'all. Many wine options at the entry level pricepoint which is nice. \"Dem peeps be friendly\" -Cales"}
{"text":"Wow - this is just what the doctor ordered!  We had a late lunch and wanted a light dinner and some good adult beverage options.  This met our ambitions perfectly!  About 20 beers on tap - enough to meet lovers of all beer genres.  Never got to the wine, so can't speak to that.  Started with a flight and identified our favorites for a larger follow up.  Soaked it all up with the meat and cheese platter that had a GREAT variety of flavors.  Two meats, two cheeses, almonds, capers, figs.  Just what we wanted.  Will definitely make it a priority to come back here the next time we are in the Phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"A great little bar with a nice selection of AZ craft brews. Lots of choices for wine lovers, too!"}
{"text":"Best of both worlds! We came here and loved the selection of great wines and a huge selection of Arizona craft beers. We had the burrata appetizer which was wonderful. The owners are friendly and helpful. We can hardly wait to return."}
{"text":"Cool set up and out of the chaos. However more like a beer pub with drunk patrons. Wine was good, but overpriced even for Scottsdale, two glasses of mediocre wine for $35.  Mike"}
{"text":"This is a great little find! Food is so fresh, well prepared and beautifully presented. Great atmosphere as a little, off the beaten path, fun and friendly bar. Many great wine and beer choices. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"What a cool concept. Beer and wine bar. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Serve AZ beers and wine. Off the beaten track but well worth the journey. Opened in August. Just do it."}
{"text":"The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and its also a dog friendly bar. They have a nice selection of beer and an excellent selection of wine. We spoke to several of the bartenders/owners here and they give the quality of service I look for when deciding if I want to return to a bar, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the neighborhood.   Love a more mature place to grab a drink and small plates in the heart of Old Town."}
{"text":"This place is great! Dog friendly patio, puppy beer, and a great beer selection. Will definitely be back as well as tell friends about this place."}
{"text":"Stop by and try a little bit of everything you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else in Scottsdale... A flight is the best way to go to try a little bit of everything. Get the Burrata with it and you won't be disappointed... Not your regular crazy busy restaurant, very chill easy going bar with a couple TVs, cool owners and bartenders. There all very knowledgeable about what there poring and can pair it with dishes as well."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Vines & Hops, and both times were great experiences! They have like more than 70 wines by the glass, and are a little family owned place. They allowed me to try a couple of rosés before I decided on a bottle, which was awesome and very helpful. I also got the hummus plate, which was so fresh and so yummy! Thank you Vines & Hops for being such a fun place to come and enjoy some yummy wine and beer and fun little plates!"}
{"text":"Decided to go to this place since everyone was raving about and it does not lie. It's a nice wine and beer bar tucked away in a quaint little part of old town. Tom helped us out, which we found out later was one of the owners. They were extremely helpful with the selections and the service was on point.   We got the Aribus Red Flight and Washington flight; which had the most exquisite taste to them. We were introduced to Fol Epi cheese, which I have never heard, that accompanied each of the wines perfectly likes two peas in a pod.   Check it out"}
{"text":"Love this great out of the way wine and beer spot.   Great wine list and my husband loves their beer choices.   The staff is always super friendly and the size of the place is really comfortable and keeps it from getting \"clubby\" which is exactly what I DON'T want.   They have a dog friendly patio for our four legged besties!    They have vegan friendly options as well and the food is always great"}
{"text":"Awesome owners-- great beers. A quick block/five minute walk from the hyper touristy mall in Old Town gets you to a relaxing space with fifteen or twenty local taps. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Love this cute and intimate place. Quality beer and winr options. Not your average wine bar..has something special."}
{"text":"Great hospitality. Fantastic selection of local craft beer and delicious wine. And a really cool atmosphere.   We tried an IPA sampler tray and some . Then ordered the meaty and cheese combo tray. Both our food and drinks were tasty.  But the best part about this place was the service. They were helpful in making selections and also willing to discuss options for our next stop on our date night. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Great new local spot. Kind of tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale but a great atmosphere. And service is on point"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place to check it out and it was awesome! Great beer selection, cool decor, and just a good vibe. Really enjoyed it...will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find! I asked for a buttery Chardonnay and the bartender gave me one of the best Chardonnay's I've ever had! The food was absolutely amazing!! I had the prosciutto sandwich (they have a cuter name for it)."}
{"text":"I love this spot so much!! It's a small spot tucked behind the main strip so it makes it really cozy! The owners are so kind and know how to run a good business. The wine flights are fun and are well priced. My husband loves how many choices they have for beer. They are dog friendly and a perfect spot for happy hour!   My husband and I love this bar. It is super cute and trendy! Definitely recommend for date night or grabbing drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"Really nice, quaint little place with a friendly staff.  Wide selection of beer and wine (including flights).  We had the bread/jam app which was really good."}
{"text":"Awesome selection! Love the green use of tablets vs menus! Quick service! Great date night option for your boo! Definitely worth the stop!"}
