{"text":"Overly priced and not accommodating. My fiancé and l went there just recently and the hostess told us because there were to of us that we would have to wait 30 min. even though there were tables available- although they were saving them for parties of four. Like I said overly priced and not accommodating."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago, and the food was excellent. Tried to go back tonight, and although there wasn't a wait, I didn't want to pay $10 for parking on a Friday night, so we went elsewhere. 5 stars for food + 1 for expensive parking = 3 stars to me."}
{"text":"After calling all of the restaurants in the flats for a reservation for 10 people to celebrate a 30th birthday I was ecstatic when FlipSide took my reservation. However, on Saturday March 12 at 7:00 upon our arrival the host stated they did not have a table ready because \"The reservation was set before I got here.\" They said it would be another 20-30mins. When I asked what could be done, he just kept repeating that sentence. I really have no idea what that means. \"Girl you are killing me\" was my reply. I had the birthday boy there and parents ready to eat. I told him he was making me feel like it was my fault about the reservation and he stated \"Well, It's not my fault.\" All I really wanted was some empathy, an apology and maybe some fries?  There was a large party that walked in after us and HAD THE EXACT same problem! They made a reservation and no one honored it.  The girl told the host \"I feel like you lied to me.\" Which is exactly how I felt. After 40 minutes of waiting, the host set the table for 8 people instead of 10. (where's the candid camera?) And they pulled over a much smaller table to add the extra two. When I asked about another table the host told me \"take it or leave it\".  ( I had previously walked to 3 other restaurants looking for tables, but they were full on saturday night already).  The food is excellent and our waiter was wonderful, given the fact that he was covering 1/2 of the restaurant. He was very polite and gracious.  During dinner another patron began arguing with the staff about waiting over an hour for a table. He left the restaurant yelling \"LEARN HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS.\"  I think that sums up the night.  They had awesome food, but such a rude host and poor execution of the evening the people in my party will never return."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour when we were told 15-20 minutes. Was standing outside waiting for our text when a couple came up and got a seat outside when were next in line. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. Even though I don't eat burgers anymore, I had heard good things, and knew they had other stuff like chicken and fish sandwiches. I love the decor and how they can open the front wall to let the outside in. We arrived around 4:30 on a Sunday for an early dinner and because the Chagrin Falls location is small, we ended up eating at the bar. The bartender was pleasant and we chit chatted before ordering. About 5 minutes after placing our order, he comes back and says there has been a computer glitch and he can't find our order. No problem, we tell him again. One burger, one blackened grouper sandwich and an order of fries to split. (Fries are a la carte at Flip Side.) About 10 minutes later our fries show up. As I am someone who has bar tended and waited tables, I know there's a desire to have the entire meal show up within a minute or two of each other, so I wait to eat any fries. Plus, I want to eat my fries WITH my sandwich. So I wait, and wait, and after about 5 minutes, i ask the bartender if we are going to get our sandwiches soon. He checks and says another 5 minutes, so I ask him to get us a fresh order of fries with our food since that's how we ordered it. He takes the original fries away and after about 10 minutes our burger and fish sandwich show up, but no fries. The bartender says nothing, so I proceed to eat slooooowly, hoping the fries will show up. (We're all seeing the irony here, right?) Of course the bartender, despite never being more than 10 feet away from us, never checks back to see if everything is OK. So eventually I finish my sandwich and flag him down asking if he was ever going to bring us our fries or not. He gets this flustered look, goes and yells at someone in the kitchen, but still no fries appear. After another minute or two, I tell him to forget it and cancel the fries. He then offers to take them off the bill. Duh! Of course you will, so thanks for nothing. He then promises to really take good care of us next time. Isn't he supposed to do that every time? My wife thought her burger was very good. My blackened grouper sandwich was average. The size of the bun dominated the small piece of fish, so it was fairly bland. It was also way overpriced. For $15 I was expecting a much better piece of fish, plus sides were extra. I typically give restaurants a second chance, and I probably will do so for Flip Side Burgers, but my first experience was very disappointing. There was nothing difficult about what we wanted, they just dropped the ball over and over."}
{"text":"Food was great!!!  Server was wonderful!  Management was pretty bad.  We had reservations for 10 at 5:30 and didn't get seated until 6:15 after they \"kicked\" a couple out of the place they wanted to seat us.  I'd go back, but wouldn't wait again.  Patio looked awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  Everything on this menu is worth enjoying. The sweet potato fries are to die for!  My rating has to do with the amount of space in the restaurant.  Too few bathrooms.  The food is super though!"}
{"text":"Best burger EVER! Homemade potatoe chips with blue cheese tasty. Eat here. Small and cozy. Brick walls wood floors."}
{"text":"Duh-licious! Have to try the One Red Door Burger... One of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Flipside is in many ways comparable to B Spot, but better overall.  There is something about the burgers (and the buns) that makes them taste better."}
{"text":"Fantastic chili pepper burger with a fried onion ring that remained crisp. Great spices and herbs on fries and a yummy sweet and salty milkshake. Friendly and attentive servers too."}
{"text":"Hands down, our favorite burger joint! We've had many different burgers here and they are always great!  Also, I love the onion rings, they're big, super crunchy and not greasy at all!"}
{"text":"The burger was cooked great. They cook their burgers medium well unless you ask otherwise but I asked for medium and it came out with just the right amount of pink. The burgers were amazing but the fries were just whatever."}
{"text":"Service here is amazing- I can customize my burger with anything I want! I do take out all the time and they are always prompt so it is ready when I arrive. I have had most of the burgers on the menu and they are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"We have been a regular since they opened in CF.  last night we ordered chill and bit into a piece of plastic that was in the chill.  Really disappointed and disgusted.  While the chill was taken off the bill - it was a safety/choking issue.  They did not go out of the way to fix the problem.  Need to focus on quality."}
{"text":"Probably the best burgers we tried in Cleveland. Onion rings were on point and truffle fries were redunk. Service was great during Saturday lunch time. Definitely a place to eat at more than once."}
{"text":"I took my family from out of town to visit chagrin falls, we wind down chagrin river road, enjoying the horse ranchers, river and estate homes on a sunny cool day. We stopped to appreciate the falls and discussed the history of the place near the waterfall and topped it off with great burgers, beer and milkshakes for the kids from flip side, a perfect 2-3 hours of fun before they had to hop on a flight back to the ATL. I was happy to have great service from the staff, it made me feel proud of Cleveland to have my family treated so well knowing that it would be their last stop before heading out. Also knowing I can have my turkey burger made well done is a winner for me. I need that as a recovering vegan."}
{"text":"Very good burger. I went with my very fussy mom who usually goes to the Hudson location.  She says much better than B Spot burgers. I got the One Red Door Burger, She got the Forester.  Both were cooked just as we requested.  We also shared the Truffle Fries that everyone raves about. I was hoping they'd be crispier. I even asked for extra crisp. Not overly impressed, but I'm not that into French fries.  It was very noisy which was odd because it was mostly empty as we went for a late lunch. I'd go again to try some of their unique burger selections."}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  Very good fries.  Shakes to die for.  Very friendly service.  Good pours from the bar.  TV's with sports.  What more could I want?"}
{"text":"They should get one star but I'm only giving them three stars because the food was delicious. The atmosphere is less than enjoyable. The bar tender kept gloating about how he can kick anyone off his bar and how much better he is than everyone. He ruined a perfectly good burger for me with his attitude. The Flipside in Hudson is 100X better than here. I will gladly drive the extra few miles for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Flipside at Easton in Columbus and in Hudson.  We absolutely love the onion rings.  Delicious!!! Light on the batter and very fresh. At this location we ordered the onion rings and when they arrived they looked liked badly fried chicken, tasted old, and were very heavy on the batter.  Soooo disappointing.   The burgers are fabulous but the wine is overpriced for a burger place.  $8 for a house wine.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for 11 years, this was one of the worst veggie burgers I have tasted. I have also been waiting to order a beer for 20 minutes, watching the waitress serve everyone else at the table but walking away before even asking me or making eye contact. Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Chagrin Falls is very charming, full of great restaurants, and Flip Side fits right in. Most of them are high-end, however, Flip Side offers great, high-quality meals at an affordable price. In addition, the burgers are made with Ohio raised, grass-fed beef. You can really taste the difference.  In addition to their burger specialties, they have salads, sandwiches, and a few other options. Their milkshakes are made from locally-sourced vanilla bean ice cream and aren't the typical flavors you're used to, like: Apple Pie Shake with chunks of apple pie, Date Shake, Blueberry Pie Shake, Irish Shake with Guinness, etc. All of them are available with various alcohol enhancements.  The atmosphere is casual and cozy, as the size of the dining space is somewhat of small. With a distressed wood feel, and other subtle touches, the décor is welcoming and non-intimidating. During the summer months, they open the \"garage door\" which makes up the street side façade, letting the outdoors in.   For dinner, I ordered the Forester Burger, with caramelized onions and wild mushrooms on a brioche bun. It also came with 2 tempura Shitake mushrooms and truffle aioli. I normally only eat 1/2 of a burger and save the rest for later. Not this time. It was so good, I ate the whole thing and didn't have that heavy feeling you normally get from a burger.   My (adult) son had the El Deseo (the Wish) Burger. He likes his food with some kick, so this was a great choice.  It consists of Pepper Jack cheese, avocado, mango, roasted pepper pico de gallo, black bean puree, crispy corn tortilla, jalapeno with lime aioli. He also requested a condiment cup of their house hot sauce - $1.00 from each of these burgers goes to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  We shared a plate of their Hand-cut Fries, which are seasoned with salt & herbs, which was definitely enough for two. They were a nice alternative to traditional fries.  Our server was friendly, attentive, refilling drinks and providing answers to all of our menu questions. We would definitely dine here again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Try the chips. Also had tuna sandwich. Yummy. Good service. Good atmosphere. Watching all college football games too."}
{"text":"Horrible management. We had a 5:30 reservation for a party of 10. They made us wait 45 minutes to get seated at 6:15. There was a party of 20 coming in AFTER us and they refused to seat us there. To make things even worse after bitting into my burger I found paper backing still stuck to the pattie. The manager was made aware but did not take it off my check or even buy me a drink. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead or 1 star is our server/bartender Devon. She was great."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and some things are great, some are just ok. The first time my husband and I went I ordered the signature burger, which I think was called \"the red door burger\" with brie and crispy shallots and some sort of sauce. When it arrived the burger was pretty much raw (despite being told burgers arrive between med-med well, which is what I like). I sent it back to be cooked more. They brought it back and it was cooked to the proper temperature. My husband's burger was cooked perfectly, so it was weird that mine was so different. We also got an order of regular fries, which are seasoned with herbs and I thought they were delicious.   The second time we went, I ordered a MIkey burger. Again it was under-cooked, but not as badly as the first time, so I just ate it. My husband's was really rare though, and sent his back. So, you might want to ask for your burger to be truly med-well if under-cooked burgers bother you. This time both of our burgers were extra salty, as were the fries. Maybe it was a different crew in the kitchen, but they were a little heavy handed. Also, the fries were not as good as the first time we went. This time our fries were short little fry nubs, like they were all less than an inch long. Not that I'm all obsessed with long fries, but it seems like there should be a variety. Maybe we got the bottom of the basket. They also were not as crispy as the first time either.   The service is decent, pretty friendly, but it seems servers cover a lot of tables. We waited for more than five minutes for refills on drinks both times we were there.  All of that said, I would go again. The price point is low enough for it to be on our short list for quick date night spots, and I think when the work out the kinks in the kitchen, the food will be consistently good."}
{"text":"Good burgers and a vast selection.  Prices are ok and the beer selection is great.  Parking is a hassle but the service was great."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and shakes.   bathroom setup is a little lame.  Overall I would say this is a great place to bring the family"}
{"text":"Love downtown Hudson area. So, my family & I decided to give this place a shot.   The service was great."}
{"text":"Lame version of the B-Spot. Yeah they have some good beers and OK burgers, but all the hype is just that, hype. Might be good if you have kids and they only eat 3 things and throw a tantrum if they don't get burgers... in which case you will need the beers."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. The place is small so seating might be tight but its worth the wait if you can. The burgers are great - I love a gourmet burger with a fried egg and my wife loves the veggie burger. The shakes are great for the kids. Outside of the great burgers, this place has a nice selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Food was alright, although menu provided a above average spread of menu items, the actual items did not translate. For the most part menu item names were far appetizing than the actual product. Burgers were small and did not include a side, fries were bland, cold and cold. Additionally wait staff was very disorganised and forgot various parts of our order. Would not try again."}
{"text":"Looooove me some flipside! I've been to Hudson and Chagrin Falls locations a bunch of times. It's always quick and consistently delicious! Every time is just as good as the first (or last :) ). Finally Cleveland has a bomb ass burger joint! Oh and the mac n cheese is real good, so are the onion rings. Hell, it's a real good!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We live right by this Flipside so typically get our burgers and fries to go, probably at least twice a month. Typically, it's always a treat and we scarf everything down faster than we should and feel content. The past two times though have noticed the quality has gone way down. Burgers have been overcooked and the fries very greasy and soggy.  Tonight, they forgot to include any of the sauces that go with the burgers & fries. The cheese on the the Say Cheese burger appeared to have been microwaved on after the fact and there were no crispy shiitake mushroom on the Forester. Obviously, when you get it to go it's not going to be super fresh but this was just bad. We will give it one more chance, but three strikes and we will be out and about to find a new burger joint. Actually, while I'm on Yelp now the search is on!"}
{"text":"my 7 year-old daughter was @ work with me & said she was hungry for a cheeseburger so, i asked her if she wanted a little kiddie burger or a really good big kid burger she wanted the big one so we came to flipside great burgers! outstanding fries! perfect onion rings! some of the best not-so-mini corn dogs  insane shakes! if you haven't already, get to flipside!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and solid service, but too tight a squeeze to be comfortable enough to warrant 5-stars."}
{"text":"We new it was going to be expensive going in. $45 for 2 burgers, a poor attempt at a grilled cheese, 2 sodas, fries and onion rings.   We had a 2 year old with us and they sat us at a 2 top, ever try sitting at a 2 person table with 3 people and one of them is a 2 year old? Yeah, its never fun. But we saw three 4 tops with 2 people at them.....emmmm, not sure what happened here.   If I am going to spend $45 bucks on a burger lunch. Please clean the cobwebs off the lights and boogers off the walls."}
{"text":"I don't care which ranch from where the beef originates (in this case, Niman) if it tastes great.     Flipside cares, as they do about a lot - the quality of their ingredients, for one thing.    I've sampled quite a few of their sandwiches and always walked out happy.    Don't skip the fries, either.  Worth the artery-clogging.  If you're a beer fan, you're also in luck here.  The vibe is dark and the diners are varied.  Stop in.  A nice, varied menu."}
{"text":"Wow stopped in to grab a quick bite! I got the flipside burger and it was fantastic!!!! Our waitress -morgan- greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome right as we sat down. she went on and got us our drinks and then took our order. What a great experience and GREAT customer service!!!!!! If you are in the area or are undecided as where to eat i highly recommend coming here! You wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Best burger on the east side.  Even with the proliferation of fancy burger joints flip side stands out. Large juicy burgers with interesting variants. I prefer the lamb and curry burger but have tried most of the menu items and have not been disappointed. Nice location in the heart of quaint chagrin falls. Large parking lot behind restaurant."}
{"text":"Good burger, great beer menu. I'm veggie and they will make any burger with a veg patty. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately on a Saturday evening. Great burgers and our waiter was very attentive and nice. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent. Fries and onion rings are excellent. Drinks are perfect. Wait is typically too long and if you are not willing to wait for an hour+ for a burger, then don't go at a prime eating time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Solid food, and great service.   This has taken over B-Spot  as my favorite burger spot. Sorry Chef Symon."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing burgers and fries, sub-par service"}
{"text":"Just about the best burger you'll find anywhere.  Not a lot of seating, which can make it a little cramped, but the food is worth the wait"}
{"text":"This food is decent. The service could've been better, but that's bc the server was new and she didn't seem to know what she was doing. I had the King James Burger. It's overrated. I ordered it bc I'm still hype about the Cavs winning the championship. It's not really that big and you don't get any fries for a $17 burger."}
{"text":"Server couldn't be bothered or even flash a little smile. We are literally the only people in here for a late lunch and he didn't know the happy hour and just made us feel like us being in here was bothering him. I so tire of restaurants opening up and expecting people to just show up. Terrible service and I doubt I ever come back. Never tried the food, just ordered our beers and finding a more welcoming environment."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place in Chagrin Falls. The burgers were well made and the truffle fries were very good."}
{"text":"The One Red Door burger is probably the most delicious burger I've ever had. A++ for flavor and not your typical \"get-all-over-your-face-soggy-bun\" burger. Our server could've been more on the ball with getting our drinks refilled, and they could allow a bit more table space so you don't have to cram between tables to get in/out. Also, I just noticed on my receipt that they make a $1 donation to Make a Wish? I'm all for it, but it would've been nice to know about this extra charge ahead of time. Lastly, this place is pretty spendy for what it is- a burger and beer joint. Almost $50 (including tip) for two burgers (sides not included), sweet potato fries, one beer, and one iced tea."}
{"text":"YUMMY burgers and GREAT onion rings!! Only thing I did not like about this place is how close everything is together."}
{"text":"Flipside is a great burger place in Chagrin Falls Ohio. My wife and I have had many burgers there over the years, and have never left disappointed. One of my favorites is the black and blue burger. The sweet potato fries are also excellent! It's a little small, so you might have to wait depending on when you go. Definitely worth a visit though!"}
{"text":"Great service by Liz.  So friendly especially with kids that she makes the experience fun!  Becoming regulars!"}
{"text":"Was there last night. There were 3 of us. One had Bison, one Beef and I Turkey. All three burgers were excellent. The regular and sweet potato fries were good too. And the beer"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend on a friend's recommendation of \"the best burger of my life\".   The setup is kind of awkward and we sat at the bar rather than sitting at a table that seemed to be in everyone's way.   We had a strawberry milkshake which was a little too icy and not quite a strong enough flavor of strawberry. It did have a nice piece of shortbread in it.  The truffle fries were SO flavorful! We'd have liked them a bit crisper but they were definitely good.   My burger, the flip side, was amazing! It was made with grass fed beef and had aged cheddar and bacon. Although it was messy, it was worth it!  My boyfriend had a burger with a fried egg on it which he enjoyed a lot. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Crazy good burgers. The place reminds me of Michael Simons B-spot.  14 beers on tap, milkshakes and burgers. And, without the pretense or wait often associated with his stores.   I had the Sonoran burger- beef burger with crumbled Chorizo, cheese, guacamole, cilantro jalapeño mayo and tortilla strips. Yum. Wife had the Chili burger with 2 onion rings stacked about 5\" tall.   We sat at the bar at 1:00pm on a Saturday. Service was great, food came timely, and the milk shakes were to die for. Saw a Jennie's across the street....sorry, but not today."}
{"text":"This location's quality is not nearly as good as the Chagrin Falls location.  Service at the bar was very slow and the bartender had an attitude problem.  Burgers didn't taste as good, onions weren't caramelized as caramelized, and the chili fries were gross, sad to say.  Someone needs to step in and tighten the belt at this location."}
{"text":"Great burgers and milkshakes are truly devine. My only issue is that when it comes to the side of French fries that they give you seems very overbearing for just one person."}
{"text":"Just the draft beer selection alone deserves a 5 star rating.  Always a few up-and-coming beers to try as well as other solid beers.  Burgers are always delicious.  Domt believe the hype on the mac and cheese.  It is not that great.  One of these days I will branch out beyond the Flip side burger and try the Grouper or the Veggie burger.  Bar service is always great and friendly.  We dig this place."}
{"text":"Nice place, not terribly big, but nice atmosphere and staff. Burgers are great, with big selections. Good beer selection. Daytime bartender Olivia is great, super friendly."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time with my family. All the draft beer was warm because of the heat wave so after two I ordered a bottle but it was weird that they could not fix their tap system. It's a burger place mostly so you'd think they have the temperature thing down pat. Not at all as my medium well burger order came out totally pink. The server tried to be evasive when I brought this up to her so I had to directly show her the high amount of pink. She offered to recook it but my family was already eating and it was late so I asked to be comped instead and she said she would. I was hungry so I still ate half of the burger plus the toppings. The manager purposefully avoided my table during the meal. Our server delivered the bill and ran away immediately after never apologizing. Her attitude was overall terrible during the whole experience. I finally confronted the manager and he admitted he knew about the problems but chose to do nothing. After I explained this was my first meal in the flats in 15 years and had an hour drive home he finally apologized. Other restaurants were busier which is why I ended up here on a Wednesday but overall this was a total bust. I would not recommend this place and would advise you to choose somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through town, on our way to Pennsylvania. We found Flipside doing a quick search for local restaurants and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Bison Burger, which was delicious, and my husband ordered the Green Eggs and Ham Burger. We also shared an order of onion rings, which are like nothing I ever tasted. The onion rings were lightly breaded and amazing. Flipside also offers hand-cut fries, salads, and other types of sandwiches, including vegetarian options. The restaurant is small and cozy, and the service is fast and friendly. They will even text you when you're table is ready so that you don't have to stand around and wait. I highly recommend that you give this gem a try! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Other than the three hour wait for a table, lack of space, noisy environment.; the burgers weren't the best.  Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overall: Didn't live up to the hype--and I was hungry.   Food: Had the kobe beef corn dogs, forester burger, and truffle fries.  Corn dogs were probably the highlight of the meal: the cornmeal coating was perfectly light and crispy.  Truffle fries were nice and well-seasoned. Unfortunately, the burger was lackluster. The bun was soft and quickly became soggy. The burger itself was thin and kind of greasy. Toppings didn't add much. I had expected more.  Atmosphere: Intimate atmosphere with lots of wood."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but not great.  We brought our kids for dinner at 5:30 on a weekend and the manager look disappointed when we walked in.  He said it was a 45 minute wait for a table.  It was obvious he didn't want the kids in there.  I called 5 minutes later when we were walking around to prove I was right and there was magically no wait for a table for 4.    We've eaten here before and it's good but not being kid friendly is a deal breaker for us.  We haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Space a little claustrophobic. Service nice. Food decent. Beer selection stagnant. Will be back but my complaint would be if you are going to slate yourself as a family-friendly restaurant complete with high chairs and coloring for my kids can you please add a changing table for my baby in the bathroom so I don't have to change him on the floor? Seems a bit crazy for a place owned by families to overlook such a detail."}
{"text":"This gets two starts for the milkshakes only.  If you like meat, this might be your place.  Otherwise, don't come here.  I am a pescatarian (a vegetarian who eats seafood) and just can't even with this place.  They used to have a veggie burger on the menu, but that seems to be gone.  They do have a grilled or roasted veggie sandwich, that is admittedly pretty good.  It's super messy to eat though, so just FYI.  They have some salads, but meh.  I mean seriously, it's 2016 and being a vegetarian (or just someone who doesn't want to eat a ton of meat all the time) is not uncommon.  Yardhouse and Town Hall, and many others, have proven it is possible.  Anyway, this fun fact isn't on the menu, but I was told by my server the first time I came (thank God she was aware and recognized that as someone ordering a veggie burger, this info was probably pertinent to me) that they only use lard (as in animal fat) for frying.  Sounds tasty, no?  So even if you get the veggie sandwich, don't count on getting any fries with it - unless that's your thing, then go for it.  If I could make a request to the management, please please please consider using peanut oil or whatever else that isn't lard to fry your food.  If the restaurant no longer uses lard for frying, then please let me know because then this place wouldn't quite be the worst.  And PLEASE maybe possibly bring back a veggie burger.  Jesus, I mean you just have to stick those things in the freezer and cook them as you need them, it's really not that hard.  So basically, come here and get a milkshake to go, and then go to any of the other restaurants in the Flats."}
{"text":"Came a couple weeks ago for my husbands birthday. The restaurant was smaller than we thought, but that does not make or break our opinion.   The burger was good, nothing AMAZING, but I've definitely had better burgers, for a better price. Also, the fries come ala carte, so that raises the price as well.  We had higher expectations, especially for the price point, but we will be back at some point."}
{"text":"I love the idea of local, grassfed beef burgers and a satisfying, casual meal before some Jeni's icecream across the road. Unfortunately, the ambiance at Flipside isn't my cup of tea: the restaurant is like a sports bar -- loud music and TVs everywhere. Why not some decor with a nice, artisan feel to reflect the food? So on our second visit, we got the burgers to go, and ate in the park across the river -- this was more pleasant, except that the fries were stale by the time we ate. As for the burgers themselves, the meat is good and there are some interesting toppings (shitake mushroom, blue cheese, etc), but the buns are just cheap white bread, as a previous reviewer has said. The burgers overall don't have much of a wow factor, in my opinion. Nice onion rings, though."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome with wonderful creative choices.  The buns are great which is a must for any great burger. But I also want point they have maybe the best grouper sandwich I've ever had!  The grouper is flown in fresh daily!! Great shakes for kids and beer selection for adults."}
{"text":"I had a PoBoy burger and it surpassed my taste buds. The service was a one!!! I just keep telling people about this place. If they keep it up they will be around for McDonald type years!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I have a Flipside near me, their burgers are like no other!  Burgers are their speciality and it is definitely a must go if you are a burger fanatic. Their menu is extensive and the burger toppings are often unique but always delicious!  If you are in the mood to create something new it's always super easy to build you're own and get exactly what you wanted.   My personal favorite is the One Red Door burger, I mean, how can you not love a burger with brie and bacon aioli?!?!    Their truffle fries and fun milkshake flavors (like apple pie!) are great additions. Some of their milkshakes come with alcohol to make them even more fun!   It's also really easy to get take out so definitely a must try even if your don't feel like eating in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent. The quality of the meat is first rate. My service was outstanding. If I had to leave a complaint it would be that the juice does not come with free refills. I ordered a cranberry-pineapple mix for my daughter and they wanted to charge for each refill."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service i have ever had! Ordered appetizers, after 30 minutes they never came. Then they showed up with our meal. The fries were cold.  The chili fries had cold congealed cheese on them.  Not coming back ."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a big Michael Symon fan. I have eaten at a few of his restaurants in town and have always had great food and a wonderful experience. I completely respect his talent in this industry. That being said, if you asked me to chose between B Spot and Flip Side for a burger - I would chose Flip Side.   I have been to both the Hudson and Chagrin Falls locations and have always had a wonderful meal. The burgers are seasoned and cooked perfectly. It's what you wished your burger tasted like when you attempt to make a gourmet burger at home. The buns used for the burger are the best, you know they are there but they are far from being overbearing hunks of bread that take over the whole burger. The selection of burgers is great. Something for everyone (including some chicken and fish options). And the turkey burger? Tastes way too close to an actual burger. Delicious!  Both fries and onion rings are a great choice. You can't go wrong with either. And our picky toddler loves their Mac and Cheese.  The reasons I give it 4 and not 5 stars are 1. Both the Hudson and CF locations are small. For such great food and the crowd it draws, you wish there was more space.  I am getting the impression this is intentional based on the similar layouts. Get there early or plan to wait. But it is worth the wait. 2. Our service at CF was okay. It wasn't horrible and didn't ruin the meal, but it was clear that the waiter forgot our orders of fries and onion rings - so we had to wait a bit for those. And we had asked for shakes to arrive after the burgers were served, and he clearly forgot that too. Again, nothing that ruined the meal, but it is clear they are working out some kinks at the CF location.   All in all, probably our favorite burger spot. We will be back more than our waistlines wish that we would. :)"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Delicious burgers and onion rings. Local beef and unexpected touches like balsamic caramelized red onions and Amish and aged cheeses. Shakes are great too; we got ours to go so we could make some room. (plentiful portions) Good place to watch sports or enjoy a patio."}
{"text":"I'm going all in on this one. And it is due to more than just amazing food. Our server was a professional--that was clear from the start. We ordered a date milkshake to split and the lovely young lady brought us our milkshake to share divided between two cute glass drinking cups, each with its own spoon and straw. Now that is what you call service. I was very pleased. I was even more delighted after I tasted the concoction, which easily rates 5 stars in my book. Rich vanilla ice cream with bits of dates throughout, giving the shake a little taste of heaven in every sip. Yum.   I ordered the Louisiana Shrimp Burger. This was my second visit to Flipside, but I had not been there in over a year, I would say. The burger was divine. Succulent shrimp in a thick patty form, with pickles, a tomato, and lettuce. The only things that were less than great I avoided. These were 1)a fried green tomato that looked to be overly greasy. Because my stomach reacts unwell to greasy fare, I de-fried it by removing the breaded and fried part of the green tomato. The other qualm was a creamy sauce on the side that came with the shrimp burger. I do not like cream sauces and so I passed on that puppy.   Otherwise this place rocks. Will return."}
{"text":"Cozy environment, great food, and craft beers. Everything is made fresh from scratch. They have a call ahead line so you don't have to long!"}
{"text":"Not only the best burgers in town but they have the best brunch too! The fried chicken and waffles are amazing!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Hudson.  Incredible value for the money.   Awesome service, delicious food, great drink selection.   This place is a tribute to the principle of doing one thing really, really well.   If you go here, you are going to get a burger.   Oh, no, burgers aren't your thing, you say?  They have lots of other choices, but you're missing the point if you don't get one of these delicious grilled patties.  They are excellent, and all of the side dishes are great, too.  I can't think of a negative thing to say.  Yes, there is a line at peak hours but that just means you are guaranteed to get freshly cooked food.  It's worth the wait.   Stand by the bar and get a beer and you will be seated in no time."}
{"text":"Service was crazy bad. They can't handle it when it's busy but I'm sure it's fine when there aren't too many people to overwhelm their short staff."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great chilli. Good Shake but a small portion for the price charged."}
{"text":"Very unique burgers that are very tasty. Service is great. Very loud and condensed environment. Not the biggest place so I had to wait for a few minutes as I do a lot when I go there."}
{"text":"There is a beautiful waterfall nearby.  Great date spot if you're not from the area.   The town looks like anywhere small town america, USA.    I got the hometown root beer. It was pretty good.   Flipside Burger: it has a barbecue sauce to it.  I enjoyed it.  Very generous size.  My girlfriend got the \"One Red Door Burger.\"  She enjoyed the shallot and the date aioli.  She thought it was literally one of the best burgers she has had.  We got the Triple cooked fries With Truffle Oil/ Grana Pandana Cheese.  They were awesome!  Overall Impression:  All in all, this place is great. I'd come back again. For sure."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers which were prepared perfectly.  Fries were crisp and served hot.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Fairly good beer selection.  Was there right after lunch and the facilities were clean and orderly.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Hands down, best burgers in Cleveland. Amazingly consistent and nearly every burger on the menu (I've tried many) is can't miss. Truffle fries are great. If you're looking for an awesome burger, honestly can't do much better than Flipside."}
{"text":"So good. So incredibly good, just being prompted by Yelp to create this review - I'm hungry thinking about FlipSide. I wouldn't say it's the 'kid friendliest' place at first look - but I came in, hungry & brave with my 3 children (7, 3 & baby) and they were accommodating. Super fast, kid menu & really nice. I like being able to take my kids out to good places - without suffering on quality of food & experience.  The burgers were the best I've had, locally for sure. Top 5 of all time? Absolutely. Only disappointment? I didn't try a milkshake - next time, for sure."}
{"text":"It's a little pricy but overall the food was good. I split an order of the flip side burger and the smokey burger(get the smokey!) and both were cooked as advertised. The toppings came on the side so if you don't like tomato it's no problem. For a side I had the house chips which were AMAZING. Overly good. I didn't partake in the drink menu but everything on it looked enticing. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"French flip was fabulous. Macaroni and cheese had a great sauce with the brisket but was a bit undercooked."}
{"text":"Burgers, we love them but we always hear how they are somehow bad for us. Well all I have to say is SCREW THAT! The burgers these guys are slinging are Ohio raised and grass fed. Guess what that means?? It means a healthier meat full of omega threes and lower in fat! So Hah!  It doesn't hurt that they also have an insanely delicious array of sides and milkshakes so unusual and tasty they will make your toes curl!  For me personally, Flip Side is the food porn capitol of the planet. Go get you some!"}
{"text":"Interesting, inventive burger combinations, and a fresh take on fries (truffle oil and fancy cheese). Intriguing, and certainly worth a try, but l don't think I'd make it a habit. It's very pricey, and I can take only so much pretentiousness when it comes to burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Was extremely upset when we arrived at 9:00, despite them not closing at 10PM and being told we are unable to order the Kobe Beef Corndogs because they're frozen.   Clearly lazy kitchen staff who have now ruined my opinion of an otherwise amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE. I've eaten all over Cleveland the past 3 months and this place and BOLD have had the best service. The truffle fries were amazing. Burger was okay not the best, but the service made up for it. Well worth it, considering how terrible Lago's service is. Thank you Juliette for giving me amazing service and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago and remember the burger I had being good as well as the blueberry pie shake. However, my boyfriend and I grilled burgers at home last night and he really wanted fries to eat with his. We live walking distance from Flip Side so he decided to just order fries to go. He ordered 2 sides of them, and when I got them home they were awful! They were extremely wet and soggy. I also picked them up right away and brought them right home, they hadn't been sitting. They're only fries, what's the big deal, right? 2 sides of fries they were $10! I definitely felt ripped off. If you're going to sell fries for $5 and some change...at least let them be good quality."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by flipside! I was attending a conference at the aloft hotel and decided to give this place a shot.  I got the say cheeseburger on happy hour special for $5, it was delicious. The real show stopper was the wedge salad. It was huge, delicious and flavorful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dine at your own risk!  6 of us went to flip side last night for dinner before meeting friends out for a night downtown. After calling at 6pm to see if they were able to take 6 at 730, we were told that they only take names 30 minutes before arriving. Ok, no big deal. The first member of our party walked in at 7:20 and put our name in for 6. We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes. Perfect - so we head to the bar. After a round or two and 40 minutes, we had seen several groups of 6+ who had arrived after us get seated. We asked the host when our table would be available since it had now been 3x the estimated wait. We were given a sincere apology, an explanation that this was not up to FlipSides standards, and we were informed that we were the next on the list for a table. Ok - perfect - we might make it on time to see our friends on E 4th!  Nope, we were wrong. A group of 8 walked in shortly thereafter and the matron of the group began to have an animated conversation with the host. 20 minutes later, a 6-top was almost bussed and we were excited to finally sit for our meal. But lo and behold - we were shocked to see the host seat the 8-top ahead of us! For those keeping up, we had now waited over an hour for a table that was supposed to be ready in 15-20 minutes.   Now - up to this point, I get it - popular restaurant, Saturday night, super busy - things happen. But the real kicker was when the manager approached us.  Expectation: an apology, sympathy, and perhaps a round on the house.   Reality: indignation, aggression, and smugness.   We weren't given an apology. We weren't given an explanation. We were lied to and expected to deal with it. And that's bullshit.   So we left, went to Lago, and had a great dinner.   It's extremely unlikely that I'll ever go back to flip side. It's also extremely unlikely that I will ever recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Wonderful Burgers and quite possibly the best onion rings I've ever had!!! Add to that the craft beers, what's not to flip over! One problem is the size of the restaurant. Very small! If you don't mind sitting on top of another table, you will truly enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"The King James special burger with filet mignon and their killer onion rings was sublime. The bacon leek topping put it into the stratosphere.  Great fries and had a really good black cherry hard cider with it.  Eat at the bar; the bartenders are friendly and the game's on."}
{"text":"Turkey burger was still pink inside and not all the way cooked through. Service was very slow. Will only come back for lunch MAYBE next time.  Smh"}
{"text":"We all had burgers. Really good!! Service was bad, though. Forgot part of our order. Didn't check back with us, though he seemed to have plenty of time to kick it in the back. Will go back & hope for different server. Prices what you'd expect in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Bartender was nice. Burger way oversalted. Decent quality meat, but why all the salt? And still don't why places have to butter the buns so much, if at all. My fault, should have asked for no salt/ no butter. Not terrible, but don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"This was the first time visit after hearing about it from friends and family. We put off going because of the drive, but it was definitely worth it. The ambiance is casual with a rustic/industrial type decor. The food was phenomenal. My wife got a hotdog and as she put it \"it was the best hotdog I have ever had.\" I ordered the Meat Master burger and found it unsettling that the waitress giggled and followed up with \"Awesome!\"  When it arrived I understood the giggle. It was two 7oz patties with a late bun in between the patties. It was more than a mouthful. It was delicious, though a bit too filling for me. We shared an order of fries which were quite tasty. We will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that a 4 star rating would be generous for this place and 3 stars might be too. When you're charging ~ $10 or more for a burger, it should be really good. Like damned good. Unfortunately, Flip Side just couldn't pull it off tonight. I ordered my burger medium rare minus, and it arrived medium to well done. The fries arrived cold, and my Stella, while served in an authentic glass, was room temp.  I don't like writing reviews that contain negativity, but I also don't like living negative experiences. Come on, I'm paying $60 plus dollars for two people to get burgers, fries, and a beer? It better be good, if not perfect.  I love to support local businesses and rarely go to any chain restaurants. Flip Side had expanded and I believe they may have lost touch with their clients.  Now, let me rant about truffle oil. Ban that &$#*. It contains zero truffles and is composed of 49 thousand chemicals that few of us can pronounce. And it doesn't taste like truffles! Kick it to the curb.  I'm going to go watch basketball. On a positive note, they have an awesome draft selection. Our local restaurant owners need to raise the level of their game."}
{"text":"I've been to the Hudson location many times for lunch. I just happened to be in the CF area so I figure I try this location for dinner. Upon entering I do see that overall this location is bigger than Hudson but just as crammed or cozy. The place was packed and people kept coming in. The hostess was very pleasant. Took less than 15 minutes to get a table. My server was also very pleasant and attentive. I don't remember ever seeing the Red door (I even asked one if the hosts if the Hudson location had this on their menu because I don't remember ever seeing it) burger on the menu in Hudson but I decided to try it. Although from the description it did not sound that great. Suffice it to say that this the best burger I've ever had here! I would highly recommend this place. The whole experience from beginning to end was very pleasant and smooth. The staff is super friendly and attentive and the food is fantastic! There is a different level of service at this location compared to the Hudson one."}
{"text":"Great burger . Checked on yelp and they had 4 stars and lots of great pics. I called and got my Togo order came and it was freshly made. Ordered a UFO beer pretty good . The burger I got is the meat lover with 2 parties of 7 oz each Ohio grass feed beef with bacon and grilled onions and American cheese. Burger was amazing and HUGE. I seen the truffle fries that everyone is raving about ; amazing ! Will eat again when I come back to Ohio"}
{"text":"Love Flipside - the fries, sauces, shakes - all great. My favorite burger place in the CLE area. Chef Shake a standout item."}
{"text":"I liked the burgers, wait staff was fine. However, I never figured out the word or words that meant, \"cook it thoroughly so there is no red\". I would go back again and use that line since \"well\" did not cut it."}
{"text":"Flip Side claims  they do not take reservations.  We have been there a few times and had to wait.  We went there last night at 5:45 and were told there was a 40 minute wait. We asked why since there were 3 empty tables. The hostess told us those tables were reserved and people called to reserve them.  We said \" so you DO take reservations ?\"  Were were told a few times \" NO , but you can call ahead \".  We decided to take my mother out for Valentine's Day last night and decided to choose restaurants the did not take a reservation like Flip Side. The entire situation is ridiculous since the hostess was basically arguing with us that they did not take reservations but the tables were reserved and will not allow us to sit down. We waited for a few minutes and then left and when we left all of those tables were still empty even though she turned us away. I will never return to flipside."}
{"text":"walked in and no one was at the door.  when a greeter finally came up, he mentioned they were short staffed.  it wasn't busy but you could tell they were a bit panicked.    that much i don't mind...but we then asked to sit outside.  the guy tells us all the tables need to be cleaned and it will take a few minutes. we sit at the bar and 5 mins goes by...to which i see 2 parties get seated outside with no tables being cleaned.  the first guy finally comes up to the bar and asks if we still would like to be seated outside.  i ask him why did they seat two parties just now if the tables needed to be cleaned; i got no answer.  we stayed at the bar where the bartender was unattentive and forgetful...salads came out after burgers, to-go-box wasn't given to both of us, side of aioli mayo was tossed in my direction which was disrespectful.  the food was average.  i've had worse, i've had better so it's nothing to gush over.  very poor experience here.  i get if it's busy...you still need to treat people with respect."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Food is stellar and so is the service.  They don't take reservations, but will text you when your table is ready so you can walk around Chagrin Falls.  Usually a long wait (45 minutes) on the weekends if you arrive between 6-9."}
{"text":"Got the Flipside burger and it was good but I was still kind of hungry after eating (doesn't come with fries). Beer selection seemed a little limited but not bad. Get some damn paper towel and soap dispensers in the damn bathroom! You guys just built that place and you didn't install those? I think bathrooms with random bottles of soaps look so trashy. You're better than that Flipside."}
{"text":"We were blown away by how accommodating everyone was to us on Sunday afternoon.   We called in advance saying we were coming with two small kids. When we got there they had our table set up with two high chairs and were friendly and welcoming. Sometimes restaurants are annoyed you want to have children AND a social life - the nerve!   We checked out the draft list and they made a few recommendations. I was iffy on what I wanted, so they brought me a small sampler without me even asking. Yeah! Their draft list is really nice and varied.  We loved our food - the brunch chicken and waffles, and the flip side burger...Dare I say better than a B Spot burger? I'll leave that one hanging. My hubby loved the horseradish mustard, and the cheese sauce that came with my daughter's fries was yummy. Not divine status, but I'd eat it again.  Highly recommend! We'll be back!! Thanks for not acting like our kids were a burden (granted they were very well-behaved. We always make a quick exit if they aren't)."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a burger - my husband and I share because they are large and we like to get onion rings as well. The One Red Door burger is so original and bursting with flavor. We ordered our burger medium and it came out perfect. The onion rings are huge and very crispy, not floppy like some competitors. I always order extra dipping sauce with them!"}
{"text":"A couple of things I need to get out of the way:  1. It's not a cheap burger joint. This is real food done right. If you want to feed yourself, your wife and all of your brats for $30 go to Steak 'n Shake and save us all from disappointment. 2. It's small so there may be a wait. If you want fast service go to Red Robin. 3. If you don't eat burgers go somewhere else. At its core Flip Side is a burger joint. If you want a chicken sandwich go to KFC. 4. If you're in a hurry go somewhere else. They take their time here. Sit back, relax and enjoy yourdamnself. Your crappy life will still be there when you get back.  I can't believe I'm doing this, a five-star review on a burger place? It's almost like I don't even know who I am anymore. Well, after our visit it just might be that I need to reassess.  Let me set the stage. Saturday evening, 6:30ish, Chagrin Falls. First of all, this town is so picturesque and cute that I want to grab it and squeeze it until its Norman Rockwell, quaint Victorian wraparound porch head pops off. A little part of me hates myself for liking it. Sure, there was traffic and plenty of people but it was a Saturday night after all. What were we to expect? We drove around the corner and found a street spot. Perfect. Did I mention how entertaining it is to watch Northeast Ohioans attempt to parallel park?  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a young lady, iPad in hand, well-trained smile on face. Party of two, right. She started to walk us back to a two-top crammed uncomfortably between several full tables. There was no way in hell this would be good; my bubble is larger than most. We scanned the area for an exit strategy. Luck. There were plenty of seats at the bar. We took a pair of them and got down to business.  The decor, where to start. I loved it. It's like a Restoration Hardware bomb exploded in here. Exposed brick, lace-up, leather-backed chairs, concrete bar top, wood paneling overhead, and warm earth tones. This is a place I could hang out in for hours unware of the time. The atmosphere was busy, pretty loud and energetic. Oh yeah, and it's small, really small. Probably 10 or so seats at the bar and a mix of high-tops for 40 more. I can see it getting too close for my comfort in the later hours.  Our bartender, Nathan, was an honor to his craft and a delight (said using Will Farrell's impersonation of James Lipton). He's was either one hell of an actor or he really loved his job. Constantly smiling, engaging in just the right amount of banter and full of helpful information and recommendations, we couldn't have asked for a better face of the business. I've grown so used to complacency in the service industry that people like Nathan really stand out. He informed us that everything was made in-house (with a few minor exceptions like the buns and the Heinz ketchup), that their beef was Ohio-raised, all-grass fed and that they had plenty of Ohio craft brews available. I felt a tear forming in the corner of my eye...  I love places that fly the local flag, especially when it comes to their protein. Ohio has an amazing farming industry that more of our eateries should use and a chef that takes the time to showcase them earns high marks in my book.  Now on to why we came here, the food. We were both having a serious red meat craving so our expectations were high. Tonight would be about sharing so we split everything. Another classy move - the kitchen split our burger for us, no charge. Minor detail massive impression.  Triple-Cooked Truffle Fries - These fries were perfect. I normally opt for the sweet potato variety but tonight we went old-school. A slight drizzle of truffle oil and a sprinkling of Grana Pandana cheese made these spuds sing. Crispy, moist, delicious and seasoned like they deserved to be.  Mixed Field Greens Salad - Just because it was a burger and fries night didn't mean we couldn't work in some health, right? This one was simple; mixed greens, carrots, cukes and fried crisp shallots dressed in balsamic vinaigrette. Not a bad rendition if a tad overdressed for my taste. Perhaps the dressing on the side next time.  Mikey Burger - If you've ever wondered what truly great beef tastes like, I mean beef so good topping it with condiments would be an insult, you need to taste a Flipside burger. It was cooked a perfect medium and topped with bacon, pepper jack cheese and a fried onion ring. It came with a garlic aioli on the side but we barely used it (was good on the fries, though). The bun was light and airy, the bacon was crisp. A perfect burger.  I truly believe that five-star experiences, especially when it comes to where you eat, are a rare confluence of the right events at the right time. Even fantastic restaurants can have off nights. Lucky for us, everything came together on this visit. Wonderful atmosphere, top-notch service and pitch-perfect food. We left full, happy and wondering when our next visit would be. What more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Hudson so had to try this one. Pricy for burgers but they are the best burger around. Love the street this  burger shoppe is located on. the quaint street atmosphere extends inside the flip side. they offer a full bar menu and have great homemade potato chips. great service, little loud."}
{"text":"My husband took me here last night for my birthday. This was our 1st visit to any of the Flip Sides, I must say I was impressed. This location is small and cozy, we were seated by the window- great for people watching. We started with the corn dog appetizer, while it was good it wasn't anything new or inventive. We both ordered burgers, I got the famous One Red Door burger and the husband got the one with the pulled brisket on it. Both were really good burgers prepared to our likeness. We also shared the truffle fries- best we've had by far. Service was great- very friendly and attentive. Cant wait to try the other locations and a shake next time!"}
{"text":"I got the Sweet Chili Pepper burger, and my friends and I split the fries with truffle oil and cheese. The portions were very big and definitely worth the price (around $13 for the burger, $5 for the fries). The meat was nice and juicy, the sauce was sweet and spicy, and the onion rings were perfect. The fries were also musky and crispy. Definitely a nice vibe and would go back again!"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the Food Original. The Local Beers are hard to chose from. The Open area for seat is comfortable.  Had a Great time relaxing and enjoying the hamburger and Fries."}
{"text":"Sat down at 530 om a Friday and was visited immediately. Derek knew the menu and beer list back and forward. My burger was done just right (medium) and the atmosphere was great. Watch out because this place is going to get busy if they keep doing things right like this. Couldn't have done better as a burger place"}
{"text":"A nice gourmet burger shop with a quasi sports bar. We went in to catch lunch and a World Cup Game. I ordered a house made hotdog with sweet potato fries. The hotdog was double thick and juicy which paired perfectly with spicy mustard and a local brew. The fries were crisp with a nice spice treatment.  The sides are sold separate and typically shared."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. Our waitress, Paige, was hands down one of the best servers we had both ever had. She was so attentive; she brought us samples of beer, offered her advice on the menu, and cleared every dish within seconds of us finishing our food (*** I'm talking even with her back turned to us while attending to folks at another table - she leaned back and grabbed my husband's empty beer glass***). The service alone will bring us back to FlipSide!!"}
{"text":"The Flipside is my favorite burger place! I have been to the ones in Chagrin, Hudson, & Columbus. They are all awesome! My favorite burger is the One Red Door! It has Brie cheese, & amazing bacon date aoli! Just typing this is making my mouth water! I have tried the regular fries, truffle fries, & onion rings - all are good but the truffle fries are my favorite! They can be very busy but worth the wait! If you are at the Chagrin Falls location, walk to the bookstore across the way - They have new & used & I always end up finding a treasure in there! I also love the Mackenzie's hard black cherry cider but they only have that in the northern locations."}
{"text":"Phenomenal burgers served with a side of attitude.  From the time we walked through the door, the staff was incredibly rude. The hostess barely acknowledged us before tossing our menus on a table - one crammed between the bathroom and the fountain drinks. Our waitress was annoyed when we asked what drinks they had - we were first time customers. The drinks were basically thrown on the table. Multiple people used the restroom (as to be expected) but left the door wide open, which was quite unpleasant given the location of the table. Even with many servers walking back to the fountain, none of them bothered to close the door. One burger was incorrect and we received more attitude when we mentioned it was the wrong order. As we finished, the check was also thrown on the table and no words were exchanged. Definitely not the atmosphere I expected for the price.  Terrible service aside, the food alone deserves more stars. I have never had a burger so tender in my life. The way the onions are sautéed is very different but very good. I can't say enough good things about the meals but the service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Wow! Went here after the Browns game this past Sunday. Loved it! The burgers and the fries were incredible. I got the Philly Burger and added bacon to it. Service was really good too. Paul(?), our waiter, did a great job."}
{"text":"Love this place. We're staying nearby and wandered out to find a quick dinner. We were more than pleasantly surprised! The sweet potato fries were perfect. The spicy mustard is ridiculous. I've never been to Cleveland and don't know when I'll be back, but when I am, I'll be eating at Flip Side."}
{"text":"Burger and beer places are easy to do but hard to do well.  But if you're in chagrin falls and desperate for food (so few good options there), try it.  Be warned that the stale beer smell offers a frat vibe and the cleanliness is subpar."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location when I was in Cleveland and really enjoyed the atmosphere and family environment.  The food and service am were great and the prices were very reasonable considering the quality / quantity of what we got.  I'll go back here again when I'm in the area next."}
{"text":"The idea of eating local, grass fed beef sounded good, so we went for some burgers. On a warm Spring Thursday night, the wait was about 20 minutes.  I was looking forward to a good burger, but was disappointed-- the burgers (a Smokey and a Forester) were both tasty, but the buns were a cheap white bread that quickly became soggy and fell apart, leaving a mess in our hands. Surely if they cared about the meat, they should care about the bun? Why not some artisan local Ohio-grown sourdough? I'd give it 4 stars then. Why not 5 stars? 1) the atmosphere: large TVs in every direction (does everything have to look like a sports bar? that's not what most customers are there for and they are distracting), music too loud; 2) the waitress never gave us a smile and was hard to get a hold of.  On the other hand, the seating host and bartender were friendly and helpful, which kept this from being a 1 star review."}
{"text":"The rusty decor attracted me and the happy hour pricing ($5 cheeseburgers and 1/2 price fries) sold me. High quality and cooked correctly. Good homemade pickles and mustard."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is it hard to find a lunch spot in cleveland that serves regular burgers? Well after searching online for a while we came across this restaurant. We came in and the place was pretty slow. We sat outside and ordered a few drinks. Margaritas are my go to vacation drink so I ordered that. It was honestly terrible. We both ended up ordering the Mikey burger (mine with a chicken breast instead)  with truffle fries. My sandwich was so good I could rave about it all day.  So even though the marg was not great the burgers made up for it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a burger place while in downtown Cleveland and selected this one.  Nice atmosphere.  The patio looked great but the weather wasn't conducive.  Beer selection is good although I didn't find too many to my taste.  We ordered two pils type beers that were OK.  The burgers were good, but not phenomenal.  The sweet potato fries were the best part of the meal.  $50 including tip for two people and OK food and beer...I'd go again if friends pushed for it."}
{"text":"Burgers were good! Had the one featured on tv. Fries were good but, expensive. They said they'd feed 2-3. It's more like 1-2. But, overall it's good food! Will go back"}
{"text":"This is probably least favorite burger restaurant in Cleveland. All the burgers are overpriced and you have to pay extra for the fries. I really don't see the draw here especially when the quality of burgers don't seem to be anything special. I'll pass on eating here when asked to go grab a burger."}
{"text":"Always great. Very accommodating with vegetarians, gluten free. Good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"While my burger was delicious, my party was mostly ignored by our server, who also acted as the lunchtime bartender. Right around the time that our food should have come out, we heard a loud crash come from the kitchen. After waiting another 25 or so minutes with no food, minimal eye contact from our server, and no drink refills, we waved him over to inquire about the whereabouts of our food. He informed us that our food had to be remade after being dropped (as suspected) and it would be an additional 20-30 minute wait.   What should have been a quick hour or so lunch wound up taking close to two hours. Initially the server took $20 off of our bill and after much resistance, my colleague insisted that the discount be increased. I likely won't be returning for a mid-day lunch anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food. Tried their truffle fries and the chicken sandwich. They have a great selection in beers and the peanut butter/rum milkshake is the best. The Chagrin falls location adds a kick to this place."}
{"text":"Like the B Spot the fried items are cooked in lard so that limits trying many items on the menu and hard to give a full five stars. With that being said, the burgers were delicious. A bit on the smaller portion size, so you might want to get two. Unfortunately my order was not made as requested. The team was kind enough to make a new burger as originally ordered. Both the server and the manager came over soon after the item was sent back to apologize and quickly rectify the issue. It is worth coming here just for the level of service alone, not to mention the flavorful burgers. If they ever change from cooking in lard or provide another option, I look forward to trying out the fried items (Kobe beef corndogs to the fries). I also got an apple pie shake and it wad devoured quickly. I look forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"We had appetizers before seeing a friend in A Chorus Line at the Chagrin Falls Community Theater. The food was great! We got the Mac and cheese with the BBQ brisket... OMG! So good! Everything is local which I appreciate and they had a good beer list for the boyfriend. We enjoyed the atmosphere and would go back again to try the burgers!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night after the OSU game, they were pretty busy but only waited about 5 mins for a table.  This a gourmet burger place and prices do reflect that, but so worth it in my opinion.  The truffle fries are amazing!  Their monthly shake was buckeye, very yummy if you enjoy peanut butter.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Been to the Chagrin Falls location several times and wanted to try this new location. It's pretty small, just like the Chagrin one but it has a cool setting. Honestly, haven't ever had an experience here that I absolutely loved. I love burgers but every time I'm at one of their locations it is never that great. Burger was a little undercooked, but I will say the chips as an appetizer were very good. Not a huge of fan of needing to order fries on the side, I have the same gripe with B Spot but I do like B Spot's fries better. My girlfriend loves the Chicken Chop Cobb salad and I will admit it looks good. Overall, fine experience and a solid new spot for this chain. I only give it a three as I am just never blown away by it."}
{"text":"When we are craving burgers, this is our go-to.  Delicious burgers, good beer selection and great service."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were walking downtown and decided to just pop in here for a drink. A drink turned into a salad that we asked if it were large enough for us to split for a little \"snack.\" The kitchen took it upon themselves to split our salad and even include a fried egg on each! And that salad.... oh my word. I don't even like mushrooms that much but this was incredible!   Since the salad was so yummy, we couldn't help but wonder about the burger. Again, we decided to share (since all we came for was a drink, anyways) and got \"the burger that started it all.\" Between the bacon aioli and melted brie- we were both in \"hog heaven.\" And you can't get a burger without fries sooo we shared a plate of right outta the fryer sweet potato fries. Uh-mazing. A little over-salted but that's just a personal preference.  We finished our \"just stopping for drinks\" lunch with an adult milkshake and an adulty root beer float (I just added a shot of rum to it.) They brought the wrong shake out for my hubby- but it was so good he didn't even care to swap it out. So, if that tells you anything....   All around, great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great drinks! Fun place and the most unique and amazing burgers we've ever had! Hubs had the Green Eggs and Ham and We shared fries. All the burgers are unique combinations and are made to order."}
{"text":"So good!!  Our server Katie was awesome and she recommended the Wine Red Door burger and it was AMAZING!  One of the best burgers I've had.  The King James burger of the month was my favorite with Leek Bacon Jam, burger (medium rare), Ohio Cheddar and sliced filet mignon topped with onion rings.  SO GOOD.  I'd definitely recommend everyone try this place.  My friends across the table and he keeps talking, \"OMG I'm so happy!  I love when I find good food!\" Lol."}
{"text":"This spot was across the street from my hotel, and wasn't crowded so I gave it a shot. Very glad I did. Truly outstanding burger - like in my top 5 ever. Excellent bacon, unique BBQ sauce, and incredible sautéed red onions. Also tried the house potato chips with blue cheese. Very good, wish they were a little warmer, but still really good. Chefs special shake - pretzels, chocolate & vanilla ice cream. Excellent. Very nice staff, nice decor - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came to this place with my buddy who is a regular when I was feeling like a burger and didn't want to go downtown; and let me tell you flip side does not disappoint. The burgers here are delicious, and they have a burger of the month that changes monthly (I think this month because of saint pattys day the burger has corned beef on it) that are well worth a try.  If you aren't into burgers they have other delicious fares like like mini corn dogs, onion rings and French fries of various flavors (truffle is where it's at).   The downside is that this place is small and can fill up; so it's best to sit at the bar where the service is amazing. They have various beers on tap and their liquor selection isn't bad either.  Overall the best burger place that isn't near Ohio City."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something new!  What a find!  GREAT burgers...cooked to perfection .  Great service!  Just a tad pricey but overall, AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Craving a burger and fries? Look no further.  PROS -Good, juicy burgers. They do them right here. Trust me.  -Extensive burger menu. I've tried a few different types of the burgers here and I have yet to be disappointed by any. There are also so many on the menu, it will take a few different trips to Flipside to try them all.  -Truffle Fries. I have yet to try any of the other fries (and they do look tempting) because I love these so much.   CONS -I think i gain about 5 pounds after every trip. Worth it.  BOTTOM LINE -I want all the burgers and all the fries."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, food, and Beer. I visited with co-workers and we all enjoyed our food.  I had the green egg and ham and we all shared the fries and onion rings.  Again a spot worth trying!"}
{"text":"BURGER HEAVEN! Stumbled into this place after finding Yours Truly was closed for renovations, I'm sure glad I did. I ordered cheese fries and the Flip Side burger, both were amazing. Not your average burger, hand pressed and very fresh. I can't even begin to describe the fries, let's just say you'll need a fork to eat them.  Best food I've had in a long while, I felt like I was in New York! If you stop in ask for Brittney, she is truly passionate about the food and makes you wanna try everything. This is definitely a place I'd make the drive for. FlipSide, you've done Chagrin Falls proud!"}
{"text":"First off, Matt was our server and was HANDS DOWN THE BEST SERVICE WE'VE EVER RECEIVED!! So engaging and personable! On top of taking care of our table, he also ran the bar and at least 5 other tables! If nothing else, we would go back just for the service alone!Luckily, they have the BEST BURGER'S WE'VE EVER HAD and the fries were the crispiest, yummiest fries we've ever had!!! 5 stars!!! I wish I could give them 10!!!!"}
{"text":"When our \"girls weekend\" room wasn't ready at a neighboring hotel we ventured out into the unknown territory of Cleveland to see what was to offer. Luckily a guard in the elevator recommended Flipside to us; great guy! Lol. They were pretty busy as there was a festival going on a few blocks away, which we also hit up later. Flipside is a cool place...borderline trendy/hipster vibe, fun menu, clean, the list goes on. We ordered wine and a bunch of appetizers (truffle fries, duh), everything was great and came out quickly. Our waiter was hilarious and gave us some pointers on what to do for the rest of the night. I'd definitely go back if I'm around town. The Flats are quite a beautiful area too!"}
{"text":"The smokehouse with brisket was One of the best burgers I've ever had. I must say better than B Spot.  Sweet potato fries were awesome but a little pricey.  Trendy location and decor with solid service.  One star off because the cheapest beer on tap was $6 and most were over $7. Come on, This isn't New York City."}
{"text":"Not that good. My glass of water was empty most of the time... and was only refilled once. The food was mediocre. I would leave off the bun when you order unless you like a soggy grease sponge. Actually... order the bun to be a grease sponge and a grease sponge only. The burgers don't come with sides and with the way they are price should. I was there with a party of 3 and 1 side of fries was more than enough. But think about this... since the sides are not included and your order a $10burger then adding $5 for French fires doesn't make sense, your side of choice should be included. Take my advice.... based off extremely poor service and crappy food go to Jammy Buggurs."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we stop here as he has been to their other location. There was a bit of a wait, but considering the fact it was a Saturday night and the location is small 20 minutes wasn't bad.   We sat outside and our server Michelle was wonderful. She made sure we had everything we needed even though we just got appetizers and couldn't order alcohol outside.   I had the tempura asparagus and sweet potato fries. The food was great, though I hope I get a chance to go back and try a burger.   My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar for a couple drinks and the bartender (M.J.?) was fantastic. He was friendly and chatty without making us feel like he was hovering. The craft beer was pricy but the selection is better than anything I'm aware of in the area.   Five stars for the best service I have gotten in Chagrin."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and even better beer selection. The only downside is that the prices are a little high for everything being a la carte. I had the chili pepper burger cooked medium rare at my last visit. It's hard to find burger places that will properly cook a burger to medium rare but FlipSide managed to get it just right."}
{"text":"my favorite is the turkey burger. and when i want to splurge cant go wrong with some sweetpotatoes fries or the best truffle fries i've ever had. flipside is #1 burger joint in my book!!!  keep up the great food :)"}
{"text":"This is the one burger place I'd recommend to health-conscious foodies. They use Ohio raised grass fed beef. I read the ingredients in the ketchup - and I approve. All natural. This is the only burger place I go ever since I discovered it. Forget b spot.  Today we had One Red Door and Chili Pepper burger. The former is a tad sweet due to the bacon / shallot aioli; the latter flavor profile slides towards tangy, proper for pregnant moms who craze sour. It is Not that spicy at all, and you can tell them to put the chili sauce on the side. I always ask them to cut the burger in half, as I feel it's easier to eat. When I was eating my second half of the burger today, I kept thinking \"oh no, I'm finishing it already. I don't want this to end. I need to order another burger so I can keep on going!\"  I've also had Shawn's and Forrester in the past. For seafood lovers they have shrimp burger on the menu, and in the summer blue crab burger.   While the food here has never let me down, the bathroom here is at a weird location, due to the limited space of the establishment. The soda/water fountain where the servers refill our drinks is one step away from the bathroom door, you have to open the door carefully so you can't hit a server; there was also a customer table right outside the bathroom. When I used it today, the hand soap was completely out. I'd take off one star for the hygiene concern."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I ever had, good flavor cooked ok, chili was short on seasoning, seems to be a theme in that town under-seasoned chili, fries were expensive but after ordering them one order was shareable by 3 people. Not a fan of everything ala carte . Like the sandwich fry combos, could cut down on the order size and easily include them for the price. Thought the burger was small for $10, nothing special not a working mans lunch stop, clean, odd uni-sex restroom, pretty noisy"}
{"text":"Just live in Houston and this is always my first stop when I get home. The flip side burger (I don't even get the bun) is so good and the salty dog grapefruit cocktail is my absolute favorite"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Flipside before the Cavs game for dinner and drinks. The decor is really cool. There have misc. art on the walls, which gives the restaurant a trendy vibe. The bar is a large with plenty of seating. We sat at the bar and were promptly greeted. The bar tender was so sweet and recommended beer options. She also recommended the one red door burger and truffle fries, which is what we ordered. The burgers and fries were so fudging good ahhhhhhhh!!! I was taken away to burger heaven and my taste buds were jumping for joy. When I was done eating the meal I was left wanting more. Not because I was still hungry but because the food was so tasty. I can't wait to go again and try another burger!  FYI: for happy hour they offer half off select beers and $5 well drinks."}
{"text":"Our experience was very average and the bill was above average! We started with the hummus which had zero flavor. I had the curry lamb burger and somehow it had zero flavor! The mint yogurt was a runny sauce on the side with no discernible mint flavor. How's that happen? My husband had the Philly burger and also described it as flavor-less. Our kids had the corn dog appetizer as their meal because there's no kids menu. In all, with two sides of fries, two milks, two beers, and a sparkling water our bill was $95! Ouch."}
{"text":"This place is has the best Burgers I've ever had.  You can get good quality ingredients  made into an amazing burger.  If you like to pile yours with everything you can of if you want simple and light you can have the Lamb Burger or the Green Eggs and Ham Burger.  The service is a little slow on weekends because their so busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Omg!! Delicious burgers and milkshakes. They have around 20 different burgers to choose from, but if you are picky like me then you can create your own to the waiter. My boyfriend got a huge double patty bacon burger with a Guinness shake to go along with it. The Guinness shake had Guinness bear in it with vanilla ice cream, which i thought was pretty unique and he also loved it. I got the chocolate peanut butter pretzel shake which was average in my opinion. We also got cheese fries that were undercooked for my liking, but they happily took them off the bill. I would return just for the burgers."}
{"text":"If you want a fat, juicy burger and a portion of fries bigger than your face, Flipside is the obvious choice.  I visited for lunch during the week, and knowing I probably wouldn't find parking in the area at lunch, I popped an uber. (I was right. Literally nowhere to park). The service inside the restaurant is fast, which I appreciated when in-between meetings. The restaurant has a hip vibe and you can't beat its fantastic location of the happening Flats.  The burger selection is HUGE. I loved the One Red Door Burger (crispy shallots, melted brie, applewood bacon aioli). That bacon ailoi is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. The \"side\" of French fries was also so large it required its own plate. Good stuff. They also present your burger unassembled, which is a little different for burger joints in the area. Be prepared to accept you'll be taking some leftovers home!  Bottom line: If you bring someone here, and they can't find something they love, they're just not trying hard enough. I think this is going to be a new go-to place when I have friends in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pleasant service. We loved the mac and cheese, smokey burger, and the one that started it all, the one red Door burger. Charming location in downtown Chagrin Falls (falls are right across the street). Music was loud but they turned it down immediately upon request. Would highly recommend Flipside for a fun lunch spot."}
{"text":"Had the Black and Blue burger, Holy Macarow it was goooood!! Their fries and onion rings are also excellent. Everyone in our party (4) enjoyed the meal. The atmosphere was festive, went for lunch on 12/22. Loved the fact that while we were told it was a 20-30 wait minutes they would text us when our table was coming up, so we could walk around Chagrin Falls and it was only 20!! The service was good, and the only thing preventing a 5 Star, was one of the cokes served kept coming out flat and at one point she put coke in my tea refill and tea in my sons coke refile. Again flat. I still would highly recommend this place for a Great Burger and Fries if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"Wish we could have dined but after waiting 20 minutes at the host stand for a table, with the host seating a walk-in table of 9 first that stumbled in drunk long after us, our two top was in the middle of a patio pathway and the whole rest of the deserted patio was somehow \"reserved\".  Far greater options and service elsewhere in the flats- we won't return!"}
{"text":"The best burgers I've ever had. We go here often. The staff is very friendly. The food is delicious. I guess if you think a burger is a burger then maybe this isn't the place for you but if you like a good burger this is the best place. (Sorry Michael Simon. I love Lola and Lolita but B Spot is not even half as good as FlipSide. Their milkshakes and the fries are great too.  To make me like it even more you can call ahead for seating during peak times at this location and even if there is a wait they will text you so you can walk around while you wait.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Great burgers.Great craft beer selection. Staff is friendly! I recommend the Chili Pepper Burger"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Flipside at the Chagrin falls location, and this one does not disappoint.  The fries are seasoned well - get the sweet potato fries, they are better than the regular ones!  The burgers are juicy and cooked well, and they have so many creative options that it was hard for me to decide.  I eventually got the Forester, which was covered in different types of mushrooms and tasted terrific."}
{"text":"warning: do not come here when on a diet! The temptation to get a delicious juicy burger is overwhlming! We got salads, which were still scrumptious and filling. We couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the sweet potato fries though. They were crispy and perfect. Great beer selection, and the milkshakes sounds awesome as well. Service here was great. No complaints!"}
{"text":"We live up the street from Chagrin Falls and we're in the village about 2-3 times a week, but somehow we never made it to FlipSide, until the other day. I never order burgers in restaurants, but during our visit, it felt wrong not to try the burgers. I went with the FlipSide Burger to truly get the real experience. My daughter ordered a plain cheeseburger and my husband had the Mikey burger.  This was the greatest cheeseburger I've ever eaten in my life.   It was juicy, the flavors of the onions with the burger and the cheese and bacon were just phenomenal. It was such a joy to eat. I can't even put it into words that can do it justice. I was reeling from how delicious this was -- and while I'm no burger connoisseur, I would take a FlipSide burger over any other burger in town, including B Spot. (Sorry, Michael Symon!)  Beyond the amazing burgers, the milkshakes were awesome and the mini corndogs were tasty (we ate a lot of food).   Lastly, the service was impeccable. We showed up on a busy lunch hour and we were surprised to get a table immediately. Our waitress, who was also the person who sat us, was incredibly accommodating even when we brought a newborn baby and a four-year-old with us. She was extremely friendly and super fast. The whole experience was fantastic all around."}
{"text":"Finally ventured down to the Flats area, and tried this place. Great spot, very unique burgers. Seems like they are trying to emulate The B Spot, but I like that concept so I liked this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  They were not full when we arrived. We were seated promptly. After waiting 25 minutes, sent hubby to bar for drinks. He was back in 15 minutes.  Still no server. Finally called one of the servers over and she took our order. We asked for another round and for bill to be delivered with the food. Another 40 minute wait for the food, no drinks, and no bill.  When our food arrived, restaurant only 25pct full.  Food was okay, but over priced. Problem is the service. No eye contact after being seated. No mention of 'hey we are backed up and will be with you shortly. No apologies for delays. 2.5 hours to be served. And, oTher tables served before Us.  After reading the other reviews, seems this is a systemic problem management is aware of, yet refuses to correct."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I was in Chagrin Falls visiting my dear friend and she suggested Flipside. I am not a fan of burgers and fries and I try to avoid them like a plague. Burgers remind me of greasy, flavorless and characterless food one gets at gas stations. But my apprehension lasted but only on the drive to Flipside. As soon as I walked in through those doors, a flavorful aroma caught me by surprise. And like many others, I too scanned the plates of food being devoured by others. My eyes went straight for the gigantic pile of Onion Rings. They looked like no other onion rings I have ever seen. So obviously it was clear that I order them. Which I did. And they were AMAZING! They were beautifully spiced. (I love Spices, People!) They were crunchy, wholesome, non greasy deliciousness.  Then came the star of the show! There are amazing Burger combinations - from your loyal beef burgers to new age salmon burgers. I went straight for the Lamb Burger with Mint Chutney. It was juicy, succulent meat with a bold mint sauce. Flipside does not hold back. And I love it.  To wash it all down, I decided to try something unconventional and trendy - The Kombucha! The Unity Vibration Ginger Kombucha. Hmm... so for hardcore Beer lovers... be warned. You might not like this! It is too sweet. And it tasted like one of those drinks that your friends messed around with just to see your reaction.  But for the adventurous and open hearted folk, try it. Once.   Overall, definitely a must try place. Has a great relaxed vibe, a bar area if you feel like you need some uplifting, and really nice folk. Next time I am in Ohio, I will make sure I find my way there."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal. No burger will ever live up to the Forester Burger I had there (and it didn't even have or need cheese, that's how good it was) and the fries with truffle oil were delicious as well. I was not, however pleased with the service. The server/bartender was not personable or helpful."}
{"text":"Craving a great burger?  Don't pass this place up.  This FlipSide is located on the main strip in Chagrin Falls where Joey's used to be, near Yours Truly.  Step inside and the interior is all decked out in dark wood.  It's a small place with not too many tables. There is a nice bar nestled in here. We got lucky and sat right down with no wait.  My friend ordered the FlipSide burger.  I got the Chili Pepper burger and we shared a side of the triple fried fries. These are some seriously well stacked high quality burgers.  Locally sourced beef seared and cooked to perfection.  My Chili Pepper burger was amazing with the pickled jalapenos, onion rings and slathered Sriracha sauce.  I was a little worried that all the heat would throw the taste of beef but that wasn't the case.  All the flavors worked just fine together.  I did pull the onion rings to the side to eat them separately. The triple cooked fries were extra crispy seasoned with salt and herbs.  No ketchup needed.  The service was first class. Our waitress kept our soft drinks topped off.  The food was superb. I put this place up there with B Spot."}
{"text":"Visited with friends for a late lunch.  Parked on street near waterfall.  Obtained table for 5 without wait.  Selection of burgers was extensive- around $12 per burger.  Can sub turkey for beef.  Fries, salad, and shakes were nice additions.  Beer selection was extensive.  Service was cordial and prompt.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"UHHH. I have come to realize that while the burgers are good (just ate the turkey burger one) it's the sweet potato fries that keep me coming back. Love the horseradish dipping sauce that comes with it.  They need to work on their burger making skills. Had a black and blue burger with all of the cheese on one side. So it went from \"where is the cheese\" to \"WHOA too much cheese!\". Spend some time evening out things. Spread the cheese. Give love to your burger. Okay?"}
{"text":"What a great dinner!  The birthday boy loves hamburgers! We also wanted to go somewhere new.  Our decision was a great one! Delicioys hamburgers!"}
{"text":"It's Flippen fantastic... Super friendly staff, I want their decorator to do my house. The menus are cool, and their brisket fries are out of this world and maybe the next one... The best part is they have Sprechter Root Beer  I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. No matter what you get I strongly recommend you put the aged cheddar on it, stellar. The fries are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I am new to Cleveland. I really love the vibe down on the east bank flats. I have heard nothing but great things about flipped so i needed to check it out for myself. I was not disappointed. I just wanted something to snack on. So I ordered the mini corndogs. The breading on the outside was super tasty, The ht dog on the inside had a ton of flavor. Love that they have ketchup other then heinz. The mustard that the dish comes with is so tasty. I ordered a strawberry vodka based cocktail. I was super refreshing. I must go back and have some of the huge selection of beer they carry. Kudos on a great places guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and pretty busy but super Fast service! Valerie was very attentive and informative for us \"newbies\"! Try the chefs shake, it was AMAZING"}
{"text":"I just spent $108 on one of the worst dining experiences ever! We arrived at 6:45. We ordered promptly. We received our food after every other table in the restaurant turned! That's right ... we sat, ordered & everyone else got their food including everyone that was seated 45 minutes after us. We got our food, part of it, sometime after 8:00. We were told the meal would  be comped ... it wasn't! We paid for everything aside from 2 drinks. We didn't have to wait for drinks! The manager threw our server under a bus! Everything is his fault. Sorry he's new. I'll buy you a round. Excuse me. We were just told our dinners were on the house. Our server, who minutes ago said our dinners were comped came back & said , um we got you some drinks, um is that ok? Or should we do something more? The manager should have taken care of the problem! Not our server who was obviously upset & sorry. We live less than a 1/2 mile away. We've dined there 25 times. We will never be back. The whole situation was madding. Good luck with the new restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good food. Wasn't a long wait for the table or the food. My one gripe would be the Mac and Cheese. Not good. Very bland. I got the turkey burger with aged cheddar and onion rings added. The onion rings could have cooked longer. But good over all. My GF got the flip side burger. The burger was good over all but the BBQ sauce was way too sweet. I would come back and recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Traveling out of town, we made sure we did our research before visiting this place. We are so glad we did. My husband and I spilt the chili burger (as featured on the cooking channel) and we split the truffle parmesan fries. It was excellent. They even brought out two plates and had a half on each, which we both agreed was very nice.  We recommended this place to our Cleveland family. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I go to way too many times. We are fortunate that one is five minutes from our house and one is ten minutes from my parent's house in Rocky River.   Their burgers are filled with flavor and the onion rings are done to perfection. From their turkey burger with green sprouts, avocado, and a spicy mayo sauce, I get it when I want to try to feel healthy, but then I order it with loaded fries or the onion rings that are just coated perfectly.   FlipSide has great beer choices which is a must with any good burger. But if you aren't looking for a burger, they also have flavorful salads with all different types of meats on them. Also, they don't mind you ordering without a bun (I don't do that, that's my mom's doing).   It's a little expensive for a burger joint but it isn't just a burger joint. The juicy piece of meat that is coated with flavors you can't understand makes it worth it. Also, they have great brunches! Definitely suggest their version of Eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries were perfect. The macaroni was good enough for my two year old and a really large portion.  I ordered the burger with spinach, an egg and basil mayo, it was fantastic. The decor was fun and it was really busy which gave it a festive air.   Con- no changing table in the restroom."}
{"text":"I live in Flats East Bank area.  I've had multiple great and consistent experiences at the Flipside at East Bank Flats.  Affordable and great dining in an area with more expensive dining. It's a gem.  Fries:  Fantastic fries!  Triple Cooked with salt and herbs gives these fries great flavor and the right amount of crisp. You won't find soggy fries here!  You can also get them topped with mushroom gravy (my favorite), bbq beef brisket/pickled jalapeño pepper, truffle oil/grana pandana cheese, cheese, or chili cheese. Occasionally the chef will have other specials like calamari frites (basically a calamari app with red sauce and cheese--amounts to just about a whole meal for about $10) or rib frites (cilantro lime fries with smoked Asian rub ribs). Can't go wrong with the fries.  Bloody Mary Bar on Sundays  Burgers:  Ohio raised premium grass fed beef.  The difference in flavorful taste from other burgers from other places cannot be overstated. These burger patties are flavorful and juicy.  Affordable--most burgers are less than $10. Money well spent.   Drinks: A lot of beer on tap and also a lot of canned/bottled drinks as well. Great assortment of great beer.  Unique cocktail selections--I've had a few and they were delicious.  All and all, I give Flipside at East Bank Flats a 5 star for a burger place that can get gourmet but also knows how to rock the basics--all at a very affordable price."}
{"text":"wow want to eat a burger and not feel like you ate a cow ? This is the place , thrid time back in the last few months and enjoy the place more and more ecah time. Great friendly servace , super food, burgers are tasty , local grass fed beef , great shakes and unique flavors and flare that leave you wanting to come back. Also a great place to watch a game , great atmosphere and resonable prices ! We finsihed off the last visit with there shakes and they were outstanding !"}
{"text":"Solid burgers, very good beer selection. Alcoholic milkshakes. I mean, what else do you need?   Clean well-kept bar area, laid out... seating just close enough to be sociable/workable for a group without things getting too cramped."}
{"text":"FlipSide has one of the tastiest burgers in town.  I have ordered the fried egg topped \"Shawns Burger\" the past eight or so times going there and cant stress how good it is.  Also I get the BBQ Brisket Mac and Cheese, which is by far the best thing on the menu.  They have a rather chilled atmosphere with a good selection of good beers.  You certainly can taste the fresh ingredients.  We try to go early because of the first come first serve seating, but it has always been an enjoyable place to go."}
{"text":"The burgers here are TO DIE FOR. We barely had leftovers.   I had lamb with minted slaw, curry yogurt sauce. One bite into the burger and there was juice running everywhere. The only downside is I actually only had 1/2 of the sandwich - my son & husband had to try it!  Fries/rings are ordered separately and are generously portioned. We had 2 baskets for 5 people.   The place is very small so getting on the waitlist ahead makes sense. It's pretty jammed up by the hostess. They do have a text system when your table is ready and there are nearby shops to spend the time."}
{"text":"The wait was pretty long, although we took advantage of the \"call ahead seating\".  We were seated outdoors and this was pretty annoying as some people were standing around us real tight and it was weird.  This place is very small.  They also don't serve alcohol outside, which we didn't know until we were seated.   We ordered a salad, mini corn dogs, onion rings, fries and burgers.  It cost me $20 for a burger, o-rings and a coke.  The regular cheeseburger was boring, and they are stingy with the toppings (pickles, tomato and lettuce).  It was still good, though, and it was cooked perfectly.  The onion rings were amazing, and the fries were tasty, too.  My pal loved the corn dogs and the salad was also very delicious and the presentation was good.  The service was excellent.  It's a good place; but don't go for a plain ol' boring burger like I did, order one of the fancy ones.  :)"}
{"text":"Hmmm sat at bar alone for dinner. Acknowledged by female bartender but wasn't  ready to order. So she left. Girl Mgr also behind bar. Talked w couple next to me but didn't acknowledge me or the fact that I was waiting. Then she left. Then bartender went downstairs came back took trash out. Had a sever get a beer for me. Now it's awkward Bc she is pissed. So she is not asking me if I am ready to order (menu closed since I was ready to order my beer. It's been 10 minutes. I am so pissed. I had to tell her u was ready to order. Turkey burger looks pink but she never came back for a quality check. My finished plate has been sitting in front of me for several minutes. I am ready to pay but there is no check and no acknowledgement. She is laughing w some regulars. Nice bartender but I should not be having or paying for this experience. Girl Mgr behind the bar again. No one is taking my dirty plate away (almost 10 minutes). Left $2 on $17 tab. No goodbye from anyone. Walked in at 5pm left at 5:51pm. No need to come here again"}
{"text":"My biggest regret was not finding out about Flipside sooner!   We went in on a Sunday night at 7:45pm (checked the website which says open until 9pm,  great) but our waiter comes up and tells us that they close at 8pm on Sundays. When I then checked Yelp the hours were way different than the website, too. The waiter said we could still order something since he had a lot of cleaning to do, so we just ordered food to go. It took about 20 minutes to get our food, and only a few minutes to head home, so we didn't have a big wait time before digging in.   I ordered the One Red Door burger, and appreciated that they put the shallot vinaigrette sauce on the side so it wouldn't soak the burger during travel. The One Red Door burger was a juicy, mouthwatering, delicious burger cooked to perfection. Note on the menu, they say the burgers are cooked medium to medium well for the perfect combo of texture and flavor. I have to say I agree with them, the burger was truly perfectly cooked. :)   We also got a side of onion rings (which were massive!) and sweet potato fries. Both came with their own dipping sauces, both of which were paired perfectly with the sides. The sides were generous portions, and maybe splitting one would've been a better choice, but they were so good I don't regret getting both!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for a great burger.  Beer selection is excellent and a fun atmosphere waits inside.  A must see!"}
{"text":"Be sure to call before you go. Do not trust the hours posted. I just called to place an order but they closed the kitchen 3 hours early because business was slow today. Wth?! The burgers are good. The mac n cheese is overrated."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this concept. I had looked up the menu online previously. I am closer to the hudson location but ended up at this one randomly. Anyways. This one is a strange set up. A split level restaurant. With medium high tables on the upper level. That's right they are in between high back chairs and regular chairs... Why? what is the point of this? The restroom, well at least the only one I saw as on the very small bottom level. How someone who has a walker or wheelchair could comfortably eat there I have no idea. People have raved about the burgers at this place. I got myself a simple burger. Burger bun and some ketchup. Sweet potato fries were shared. The burger itself came with a tomato, lettuce and pickles on the side. .When I ordered my burger the server said a little above medium for you okay? No its not your actually supposed to automatically cook a burger to at least medium well unless specifically told not by the customer. Its actually  a standard.You can't even suggest something less than medium well. The customer must do it. Okay pet peeve here. The vegetables were wilted. How does a pickle wilt? I will tell you how. They store the vegetables in their own juices so they get water logged. Its not technically a health hazard but it destroys the taste of the vegetables and its just gross. Onto taste . The burger was just okay. It really was not anything special. I honestly do not get what all the hype is about. I could probably get a better burger at Five Guys. At least there you can see their meat is freshly ground and formed in front of you. Their veggies are fresh. And the Fries are fresh cut from potato's stored at the location. Flipside's sweet potato fries were over fried. I was trying to find the flavor of a sweet potato fry. I couldn't just got burnt fry. The server was okay. The host was young. That's about it. Don't know if she was hired because of how she presents herself or what but hosting didn't seem like her area. No have a good meal. thanks for coming. Just here you go? Here you go? Your report card filled with F's. here you go , your bill for the repairs to your car? Sounds like something bad is coming after. Here you go.. Would I go back here. Maybe. I wouldn't rush. But I would choose a place like Five guys over this place any day. Its a shame to. Great name, Great feel, great concept. Awfully put on. Its like hearing your local theater is going to do Phantom of the Opera and finding out the performance is not that good."}
{"text":"Check my profile, I'm pretty stingy with the 5 stars. What these guys are trying to do, I'm not sure how they could do it better. It's small, but we were able to sit at the bar right away on a busy weekday at noon. It's not just burgers, but the burgers taste great. Quality ingredients and well thought out combinations. Onion rings deserve their own 5 stars. Good drink selection, I would have tried the pumpkin milkshake with spiced rum if I hadn't already ordered something else. Fits right into this cool little neighborhood. Great spot."}
{"text":"My family and I love to have burgers and milkshakes at flipside. They have some of the best milkshakes in town and their seasonal flavors are always delightful. I don't eat their vegetarian burger is absolutely fabulous. I never miss an opportunity to order the french fries as well. Their french fries are perfectly cooked and seasoned. They are sweet potato french fries with the horseradish cream are very addictive. I do wish that the restaurant was a bit larger and that they would take reservations.if you were comparing this place to Bspot, flipside blows them out of the water."}
{"text":"Burgers are really good! The smokey burger was awesome, loved the BBQ pork on the burger and jalapeños. The onion rings had a light batter and the dipping sauce was good! The asparagus and mushroom tempura was amazing and the truffle fries were excellent as well. Reasonable prices too! Great burger joint. Only con you don't get a side with your burger, but you shouldn't need it with the apps! Definitely going back"}
{"text":"this place is dope they have good burgers. male servers are kind of bootleg."}
{"text":"All the burgers are great, excellent beer menu. The chili pepper burger is incredible, the triple cooked fries and the onion rings are great accompaniments."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome. The truffle fries are outstanding and all the burgers we've tried are delicious. The service is absolute crap. They are nice but can never seem to get anyone's attention. It takes 10 minutes after sitting down for them to take your drink order, and don't even get me started about how long the check takes. They're usually just standing around the bar.. they need to pay more attention to the customers and glance so we can ask for drinks, checks, food, etc."}
{"text":"Quite the disappointment is all I can say for FlipSide. The portions are small and the prices are high. The service is adequate. There are much better choices in Chagrin Falls for dinner. I hear Rick's Cafe is under new ownership. Try that instead. Ciao."}
{"text":"The staff here is outstanding!  Super attentive and so kind even during busy times. The food was great, the cheesecake milkshake was a huge hit with our friends.  Very highly recommend this place if you want a great quality burger, bar, and shakes!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in Cleveland. And, it's not even in Cleveland. Well worth the drive to chagrin falls.  The burgers are amazing. Especially when compared to the B spot, which everyone will tell you is the best burger spot when you come to Cleveland. My favorite burger at flipside is the forester. Great choice for someone that loves mushrooms. Great addition for this particular burger is Brie. Also, a burger here is not complete without a side of truffle fries. The last time I was here, they told me they're opening a new location in the flats, so excited!"}
{"text":"After 4 1/2 years without red meat, I broke down for a Flipside burger. Specially, the burger named flipside. This burger made me a believer. It's as if all burgers before it treated me badly, and this one showed me I could love meat again.  I have grown accustomed to the color and texture of turkey and veggie burgers, so to see the grey juicy hunk of beef on my bun (I got it well done) was strangely intriguing. This burger also came with cheese, onions, and bacon, but I held off on the bacon (not going too meat crazy just yet). In a word, it was delicious. At the suggestion of the waitress, my boyfriend went with the Shawn burger which had bacon and an egg, which he also loved from the first bite. These burgers are seriously grilled to perfection and dressed to impress.  We ordered a plate of onion rings to start and a plate of fries with the burgers. Both were pretty good, but next time we'll just go with one. Each order was more than enough for 2 people.  Bravo, FlipSide. I may not be ready to completely dive back into the world of Ron Swanson, but thanks to you I may just tip toe back in every now and then."}
{"text":"I've been to the flip side in Rocky River and decided to try out the newest location in the flats for lunch. When you walk in it is similar to other locations with wall art that is cool and Cleveland. My favorite is the burger with lady legs. Totally random, and Awesome!   The dining area is not that big. Surprisingly, the patio area looks the same size. We came at lunch and it was full. We didn't want to wait the quoted 20 minutes, so we opted for searing at the bar.   The food is sooo dang good-if you like burgers of course. I ordered the flip side burger and it was fantastic. I also ordered the truffle fries. These were also great and big enough for all of us to share (3 of us).  This is not the cheapest lunch, I scathed by with a $20 lunch bill. But, the food is great and the atmosphere the same. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went with my older son for a late lunch. Heard so many good things we were super interested. Picky son ordered a plain burger. I ordered a cheeseburger. They do not come with sides, so we ordered plain fries which are served with delicious herbs. Yum. We loved the fries which came out first. The hamburgers followed. They are a nice size and I did not finish mine. My son did. The burgers were good, but the hype did not live up to the burgers. The servers were good and attentive. The bill for water, one plain hamburger and one cheeseburger and a side of fries was $22 plus. Place was packed so even though I think the price point is high, obviously the crowd tells me that this is not the case. I suppose it is chagrin falls....Anyways, been there done that- most likely won't do it again."}
{"text":"Love their red door burger, truffle fries and chocolate milkshakes! Others in the family love their seared ahi tuna sandy burger. I've heard too many bad reports about trying to eat in, so we just get it to go -- works great for us! One head's up: be prepared to pay a pretty penny."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. The food is excellent in all aspects. Quality ingredients often local, great tasting and very thoughtfully prepared. The one red door burger is one of the best burgers I've had and you can't go wrong with fries or the onion rings. (All fried food is fried in lard) the pricing is a bit high fora burger but it's more of an artistry burger than just your average American burger. Everything is sold separately so prepare to pay 5-8 dollars extra for any sides. I will say though that you get a large portion of fries or onion rings so I would recommend splitting a side between two people.   The three star rating is mostly due to the rude hostesses, and their pathetic excuse of a milk shake.    We used their app wait in line to sign up for our table. We were told 40-45 minutes. No problem we were at home and on our way. We arrived 35 minutes later (5 minutes before the earliest seat time) and went to make sure we were on the list since it is an app sign up. Everything was fine we were in line and when asking for a time the hostesses had no idea and said there's still a ton of people in front of you. Okay. This was happening all while the hostess was practically yelling at another customer who said they were told 35 minutes and it's been over an hour. The hostess literally told her what do you expect me to do force people to eat faster so I can seat you? Very rude.  The same thing ended up happening to us and even though we made our reservation and we're given a wait of 40-45 minutes we ended up waiting an hour and ten. This was a bit of a pet peeve mostly because the hostesses were so ignorant in their comments and were loudly speaking about customers waiting in line like no one could hear them. It was pretty awkward.   The other thing that was a huge disappointment was the milkshake. 7.95 dollars for a half full glass is ridiculous and unprofessional. It also took over 10 minutes to receive. The milk shake tasted fine but if you're not even going to fill a glass of it AND charge almost 8 dollars then I'll pass go get a real milkshake or ice cream from one of the other 5 places in chagrin falls.   Yes I would recommend a burger and fries or onion rings but not much else. And I definitely don't recommend during a busy time. It's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I walked in here on Saturday night around 9:00 pm with my husband. The place was not  super packed but it had a good amount of people inside and out the restaurant. We were seated immediately to a booth. The server was also a bartender who took our drink orders and as well as the food order. They did a really good job keeping track of what we wanted for our drinks and as well for my orders of food.I ordered the philly burger with jalapeño slices. All the  condiments comes on the side. I got my burger medium rare which tasted very delicious . I also got the truffle fries which has to be ordered on the side. The portion for the truffle fries were enough to share for two. The burger was also a good portion and very delicious. Overall I do like the service, the place, and the delicious food. I will definitely coming back here more often when I want a really good burger and fries."}
{"text":"Solid.  If they changed their name to \"A Solid Burger Place\", it would be very apt.    This was our first trip to any of the FlipSide, but we have eaten at One Red Door, so we knew what to expect.  FlipSide delivers the same upscale casual atmosphere you expect, in a more relaxed setting.  The dining area is also the bar area is also the waiting area, so the noise level is moderate and you can see everything going on.  The menu has a good layout featuring what you'd expect to be featured...the burgers and appetizers.  The food itself was, as you could guess, solid.  We didn't venture too far on the menu and ordered burgers all around, including the FlipSide burger and the Green Eggs and Ham burger.  One downside is that neither fries, nor any side, were offered with the burger.  The 4 of us ordered a side of fries that was almost suitable for the table, but it's just another way to tack $4 on to the bill.  The downside of all this is that no one came out raving about the burger choices and there wasn't anything particularly memorable about the food.  Maybe that's good.  FlipSide has been at this for a long time, so they are not new to the burger bar game, but as a veteran, they play like a dependable veteran.  Burgers? Solid.  Fries? Solid. Burger selection? Solid.  Beer selection? Solid.  Service was just below what we'd expect, or come accustomed to, but she was busy and all of our food came out correct.  The beer menu was extensive, but only a few local breweries were included.  At this point, how do you penalize a restaurant for being solid?  You don't, but that's also why the 5th star is missing."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.  They have a discrimination policy in place that restricts people of a certain age."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. It appeared there were only two staff working at a weekday lunch time so things could slow down if it got really busy I suppose.   The patio is pretty nice.  It is open air, but had a covered roof so that kept down the heat of the day some.   I ordered the Chili Pepper burger.  It came with an onion ring on it and pickled jalapeños on it which were good. There was a sriracha and smoked chili ketchup that was served on the side. It was spicy, but I could add a good amount of it to the burger. The burger was good, and I would order it again, but I was slightly left longing for a bigger flavor punch.    Fries do not come with the burger (~$6). I tried the fries with truffle oil and Grana Pandana Cheese. They were good and slightly crunchy. The truffle flavor was apparent."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place may have been the best find in 2016 so far. My colleague and I were in town for work and after a quick search found FlipSide and boy am I glad we did!   This is such a cool bar / restaurant. You walk in and while small has such a great vibe. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender. They had a lot of AMAZING local beers, which I will alone come back for. The bartender was nice enough to put on the NHL playoffs.   I had the burger and sweet potato fries, and my colleague had the chorizo mac and cheese and house made potato chips. I was blown. away. by everything we got. In particular the chorizo mac and cheese. It was SO delicious.   All in all I'd say definitely worth a trip in the area."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off this review by saying that I have searched high and low for a burger that rivals that of FlipSide, and I truly cannot find one.   FlipSide has an extensive menu and something for almost everyone, but trust me - the only burger you'll ever need is the FlipSide Burger. It includes everything I love on a burger: aged cheddar cheese, thick Applewood smoked bacon, grilled red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a house-made barbecue sauce that is to die for. The barbecue sauce is both sweet and salty, and is a perfect complement to the sharpness of the cheddar cheese. I would eat this sauce with a spoon; it is so addictive! I've tried other burgers on the menu, but I always return to this one. The beef at FlipSide is locally sourced from Ohio-raised cattle, and you can really taste the difference in terms of freshness. I can't say enough good things about FlipSide's burgers. An easy five stars.  The French fries are also delicious, as the rosemary on top provides a unique flavor. The shakes are fantastic as well (if you have room for one after your meal - hah!).  People in Pittsburgh think that Burgatory or BRGR have great burgers, but clearly they have never been to a FlipSide. All other burgers are now entirely unsatisfactory to me. Thank you, FlipSide, for sending my burger expectations through the roof and prohibiting me from enjoying them almost anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Have already been to the new location twice and loved it each time.  Great burgers, spicy pickles and fries.  Can't wait to try a dessert - next time for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in the area.  There are plenty of good burger spots around, but this one is close to me (not the closest) but has the best variety of burgers and sides.   The sides are great, the onion rings, hand cut fries, house made potato chips w. a drizzle of yogurt drizzle, blue cheese crumbles and hot sauce on the side (my favorite), and a couple of heavier items w. meat I haven't tried yet.  Flip side offers various mac and cheese options,  from plain to w. bbq brisket, w. grilled chicken, or even w. chili.  I will have to try them next fall.  The menu also offers an array of salads, and protein options for them.   Sandwiches, stone oven pizzas and a vast kids menu are also available as are milkshakes and a variety of beers/cocktails.  But the main attraction here is the burger.  The signature burger, the FlipSide Burger is described on the menu as \"2 year aged Cheddar cheese / apple wood bacon / charred balsamic vinegar / red onions / house made BBQ $10.29\"   And yes, its fantastic.  So are many other burgers on the menu.  It's the variety on the menu coupled with the fact that their main attraction is so spot on that makes me go there more often than their competitors."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Seriously amazing. Satisfies my burger fix!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty good, friendly staff & food is yummy yummy, just the beer wasn't cold .  Must try is Onion rings best on the planet"}
{"text":"I would have taken a picture of my meal, but I was too busy enjoying it to bother. Even though we couldn't get the (incredible looking) onion rings because they use lard for frying, we were fine with our brew choices and sandwich choices. Our server, Paige, was knowledgeable and cheerful. We sampled a couple of the featured beers and chose a coffee flavored brew. I like that they feature OH micro breweries. The kitchen is small yet extremely efficient. I had the short rib sandwich, med rare and my hubby had the veggie entrée. They offer gluten free options as well as bun-less options. Dessert looked good, but I had a lighter tasting beer to finish off my meal. I did consider the alcohol laden milkshake (the lady at the next table told me how wonderful hers was, so that's for next time. Dishes are moderately priced. This is not a great place for children. It is noisy (tv's on) yet cozy for couples and, even though it's a smaller space, accommodates parties of 6-10 with ease. There was a line out the door as we departed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I think it's hard to find a bad hamburger. So many places have modified and perfected the art of a great burger, including many of my grilling enthusiasts that I think this place just falls within the lines of ok to pretty good. I've been meaning to check this place out for a long time because of its reputation and it's tantalizing smells even when just walking outside and past the venue. Tried to call in for a reservation on a Saturday evening but they said they didn't take any, which worked out ok because the place was only 1/4 full and we were able to be seated right away.   I chose the namesake Flipside Burger, 7oz burger cooked to your choosing (medium rare for me) on brioche bun, home made bbq sauce, balsamic red onions, aged cheddar cheese and appelwood bacon. I think overall it was a bit greasier than I expected. Lots of napkins were consumed. Meat was cooked the way I liked. The bbq sauce was unique, had a little bite to it. Everything a la carte. Ordered a side of fries with truffle oil and grana pandana cheese sprinkles, medium cut (not steak fry cut nor shoe string) so some pieces were crispier than others. Overall the fries were a little heavy on the oil and I couldn't get myself to finish the fries.  Nice beer selection, from the cheapest domestic to 9% craft drafts.  Service was on par, very helpful, gave great suggestions, kept our waters filled and didn't take too long for food to come out.  No dedicated parking lot. If you're lucky, there's free parking at meters (weekends or after 530pm on weekdays) or pay in the parking lot dedicated to whole east bank of flats  In summary, I think there's a lot of great burger places out there but I wouldn't put this place as a front runner."}
