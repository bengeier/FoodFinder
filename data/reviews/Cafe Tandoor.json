{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago. Thoughts

1) Food was generally good. What you'd expect from an Indian place selling food in a middle class suburb. Naan was fresh and tasty, samosas were large and filling (extra charge for mango chutney was an annoyance, however). Tikka Masala and Lamb Curry were both tasty.

2) Service: Attentive (they were constantly filling up our water and since it was still hot out, it was a nice touch) but the time to get the food was a bit on the unacceptable side. They brought it just in time to stop me from complaining for both courses 

3) Drinks - Upon walking in, I saw a rather well stocked bar for a smaller Indian place. Hopeful, I ordered a drink from their \"Indian specialties\" menu. Quite unsatisfied with that -- it was small, tasted cheap (felt like it was made with discount vodka) and didn't taste much like mango. 

Good but not spectacular. If you're in the area and crave Indian, probably could do worse."}
{"text":"The food at this place is disgusting.  I would have given it 0 stars if that were possible.  I'm not usually hostile in my reviews, even when I don't like a place.  But this place was SO bad it pissed me off.  And at the prices they charge, I consider it fraud.  If it were not a** cold out, I would have driven all the way back to demand a refund for my take-out order.

I ordered Indian basics.  Veggie pakora, meat samosas, chicken korma, and aloo palak.  Only the meat samosa was even edible, and that's just because fried dough around ground beef is hard to ruin.  But it had no flavor or taste whatsover.  And the peas were uncooked, hard and crunchy.  Everything else went straight in the trash.  The pakora was like sawdust and the ratio of bland breading to alleged veggie was about 100:1.  The chicken korma looked and tasted like glue.  And the aloo palak looked fine, but had no taste whatsoever.  To be fair, the sweet sauce for the samosas was nice, but only because it tasted like barbecue sauce.  I suppose the rice was technically edible, although cold.  But what is the point of plain rice without anything to put on it?

I gripe all the time about ethnic food in Cleveland, and Indian is the worst genre.  But this is far and away the worst food of any kind I have tasted in Cleveland."}
{"text":"To Qasi S...
You have to be outta your mind to say this is the worst Indian Restaurant ever... I lived in NYC for many years searching out the best Indian food,  Finally found it in my hometown of Cleveland.  You must have a beef with the owners or something, because you are dead wrong."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????

{"text":"Solid place for a quiet Indian dining experience. Located just across from Crocker Park, this restaurant has likely seen fewer patrons due to competing offerings. But the food here is quite tasty (if a bit Americanized) with nice quality and average presentation. Suggest the Chana for the vegan or the Anek Swad Tandoor Ke for the meat lover. Papadum and samosa is above average."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. Service was great and the restaurant was fine. Our appetizer plates (mixed platter and grill) were fantastic. The food in general was good and very fresh. However-and this is a BIG however - it seriously lacked spice. We didn't ask for the food to be particularly spicy, but we live in an area with a huge Indian population and \"mild/medium\"  is still hot enough to burn (ordering hot around here is akin to asking for a plate of raw chilis), I expected *some* heat. The spiciness/depth of flavor was good, but the spiciness/heat was seriously lacking, and I don't like my food particularly spicy hot. I know that the area may influence the preferences, but I wish they would better explain what they mean by \"how hot\" or \"how spicy\" and not be so afraid to let non-Indian folks experience a little heat. I can't imagine that Indian patrons visiting get the bland food that we did (I have lots of Indian friends, and I think many would have sent it back!). Overall, though, the food IS good and fresh - just ask them to give you some heat!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this is the most authentic  and classy Indian restaurants in ohio. The place is very clean, the staffs are very friendly and polite, and the food is beyond phenomenal! I went here about a month ago because me and my friends love Indian food especially the Rogan Josh and their bread is beyond words! I cannot compare this restaurant  to any other ones because it is simply the best! The food is fresh, they have variety of dishes, delicious wine, and simply the best dessert also. If anyone loves Indian food and wants a well-satisfied meal, I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not authentic, not spicy, not even good.  I have been raised vegetarian since birth and was completely offended to discover meat in my eggplant dish that was selected off the vegetarian menu.  Even more disgusted when I was told my friends lamb dish \"crossed over\" into my dish.  The vegetarian sampler dish was just as awful, samosas were cold, bland and very doughy, the rest of the plate consisted of fried onions. They did not offer to remedy the situation, only to make me another dish as if I could trust them ever again.  I hope they go under for they are insensitive to their customers needs."}
{"text":"A big fan of Indian food, I was very disappointed with the food here with its utter lack of spiciness and blah flavor. Service was nice but forgot to mention that you must order every piece of your meal separately, even rice which usually comes with the saucy chicken dishes at many places. Price also is above the norm while portions are quite small in comparison. Not going there again."}
{"text":"Good for an \" on the way to NYC\" quick stop off.  Very good wait staff.  Food was not bad."}
{"text":"I came to visit my family for Christmas and this was one of my must eat list. There really isn't any Indian restaurants in Midland (is there any at all??). So  I was blessed to have my fix of rogan josh and naan.The homemade mango ice cream was so so. The food doesn't taste as good as it was when I first ate there in 2005... but hey ok Indian food is better than none!"}
{"text":"Nothing is quite like well made Indian food to satisfy my appetite, but this is certainly not the restaurant that can give me a food orgasm.  Indian food is about depth of flavor and cafe tandoor barely scratches that flavor surface.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it tasted like it came from a box in the international food aisle of Giant eagle.  Very plain singular flavors at a higher than average price.  These economic times are tough on bad restaurants and I can't imagine this restaurant surviving."}
{"text":"Considering the number of Indian restaurants in Cleveland the food here is decent. Not even close to the authentic Indian taste. I had the butter chicken, and it was okay. But the service and ambiance is good."}
{"text":"I really love the butter chicken here - just about the best I've ever had (and I've had butter chicken at many different restaurants). The service is consistently good, the atmosphere is fine - clean and spacious, not terribly interesting. The samosas are ok - a bit dry. Great naan. That said, I stopped going here because I didn't feel the prices were justified."}
{"text":"I read the reviews for the restaurant before heading over but definitely not what I expected. 

I ordered the garlic naan and navratan korma. The garlic naan although nice and fluffy was not at all garlic-y. Even though I asked for super spicy(indian spicy - being Indian) for the spice level, my navratan korma tasted like tomato purée/ketchup.

My friend had the shrimp curry (can't remember the name) which was supposed to have coconut in it, and she said that it definitely was not seasoned enough. Another friend had some sort of ground lamb which he did say was cooked well and tasted nice. 

The mixed vegetable pakora appetizer was probably the best thing I had at this restaurant. Not too oily and crispy. Chutneys were also very nice.

The BIGGEST issue we all had was that the entrees DO NOT come with rice. What kind of indian restaurant does not provide plain basmati rice with their entrees? It would have been fine if the prices reflected this issue, but no, the prices were as high and higher than other restaurants in the area that provide rice with their entrees.

Entrees are $10+, and naans around $3. We didn't even order rice :(

This is definitely overpriced and the servings are quite small too compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 8 years and get the same thing every time. Keema Naan, Saffron Pulao, Butter Chicken, and Lamb Shahi Korma. Every time it impresses me. Never too busy and I'm not sure why. It's such a hidden gem. The staff is incredible and the food is outstanding. I won't stop coming to Cafe Tandoor."}
{"text":"This was my first time to an Indian restaurant, and I really enjoyed it.  The food was really good, and the service was excellent.  I'm a fan, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The most authentic Indian cuisine I've ever had (other than when I was in Delhi). Atmosphere is very cozy and relaxed. Bread and rice don't come with the meal, so be sure to order some. You can choose how spicy you want your food (scale of 1-10). Service is friendly and fast. Prices are fair. Will dine there again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Prices are borderline high for an indian restaurant in Cleveland Heights. $13.50 for butter chicken. And it is a THREE dollar up charge if you want a single order of rice. Most indian restaurants include rice for free.  However, their menu online, which hasn't been updated in 3 years, says the price is $2.50. After pointing out the discrepancy they still said they would charge $3, for dirt cheap basmati rice.  I ended up canceling my $50 order out of principle.  I wish more Indian restaurants had basic business and customer service common sense, then they would be around longer and not lose customers."}
{"text":"Typical stuff that you and find in any Indian restaurant. Very pricy. Rice or bread do not come with your 16 dollars main dish. Wasted money to buy saffron rice, it was just rice with orange food coloring. I cook Indian food too, if the color was that dark, you'd smell the saffron from far away, but this one didn't even in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is my favorite indian restaurant. Food is always delicious. You can order the spice level as you like. I  ordered MH and it was flavourful. Chicken Masala with garlic nan was awesome. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"This place is quiet. Which is a good thing, I think.  THe location is privately nooked almost out of sight from anyone (although in a strip mall next to a nice camera store) so it tends to slip my mind that it exists - but the great food and professional service makes it one of my favorite places to go!  Whenever my wife mentions it, we end up there and have a great meal.

It can be a romantic dinner or just a casual bite- either way, there are no TVs or anything - instead ... there are a few statues (which my 5-year old claims need more clothing on) and artwork that bring the Indian culture a bit closer than it was before you came in the door.  

I've brought kids several times and they tend to make it go from craziness level zero to crazy level 6. But that's out of 10 and the employees there are always super laid back about it.  They have a kids menu that is great and they give out crayons and a decent Taj Mahal drawing for the kids to color in.

They have a nice (although tidy) selection of bottled beers and wines as well as many great dishes.  Really an excellent place to get a vegetarian meal that is wholesome and balanced while being extremely tasty.  If you  need a relaxing dinner without distractions, Cafe Tandoor will leave you thanking Annapurna (the Indian God of food and cooking)."}
{"text":"The food Is atrocious. There are much better Indian restaurant's was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, but I am the only one in my family.  My boyfriend, who will try anything, is now in love.  We go here mostly for birthdays or our anniversary because it is a little out of our normal date night range.  I love the vegetarian options and the bread selection.  

My faves are the cheese dishes and I like it hot.  You order your heat on a scale of 1-10  Unless you are very spicy minded, 7-8 is pretty hot."}
{"text":"Worst food i have ever eaten... Ordered online and got very hard & rubbery chicken pakora..Dont even think of try it..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food. The percussion in the music was a bit monotonous, but hey this review is about service and food, so not taking points off for that!"}
{"text":"We ordered a ridiculous amount of food and did not receive rice with our order.  Wow for the money they charge to not include rice!!!!!!  This restaurant just lost a lot of recurring business in Westlake Ohio."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with great food, and good service.

I ordered a lamb biryani. There was a mistake in my order, so I told the manager about it. He apologized for the mistake and offered me another order for free as a compensation, which I gladly accepted. 
The manager handle the situation professionally, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food for the whole family -- even my PICKY eater found a dish he liked. The service was good and the owner was invested in making you happy without being obvious or annoying. There is definitely enough for two people to share one meal if you get an extra side of rice. There were four of us and we got 3 entrees, side of rice, garlic naan and rice pudding all for $66.00. The food was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Definitely going back!  Oh I forgot to mention that price included 3 glasses of wine (1/2 off wine night!)"}
{"text":"It's taken me a while to write this reveiw. It was fine, but definately not great. And expensive for the quality. It's just around the corner, but for the past year we have been driving out to Mayfield Heights (great, cheap takeout) or Lakewood when we want a sit down meal rather than going back."}
{"text":"We have been craving Indian food recently and decided to give Cafe Tandoor a try and boy was that a mistake. We ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken korma, what we received doesn't even come close to what one would expect. The tikka masala chicken was all dried out and hard, there was no real sauce to speak and the flavor wasn't even close to what one would normally expect. The Costco tikka masala is a much better representation and gourmet compared to what we received from this place. I will certainly never order from there again."}
{"text":"(From November 2011): My mom had never had Indian food, and my dad won't eat it, so I got a bunch of take out from Cafe Tandoor when she was here on a solo visit. We ordered: the vegetarian appetizer platter (which didn't  come with paneer or really any variety of pakora), samosas, chicken korma (medium), chicken tikka masala (medium), rogan josh (spicy), saffron rice, plain rice, garlic naan, plain naan, and mango lassi. There were multiple problems with the quality of the food and this restaurant.

1. NO FLAVOR. Holy bland food, Batman. The only food that had any flavor was the samosa. It was the spiciest thing that we got in the order. Do you know what it's like to eat bland chicken korma? It's essentially warm cream with chunks of chicken. At least the tikka masala had other vegetables in it to give it some taste. The rogan josh had a little kick to it, but I still would only classify it as mild to medium spicy (3 on a scale of 10). and I ordered it hot! So if that's the spiciest that Cafe Tandoor can make the food, count me out. Maybe it's just me, but what's the point of getting Indian food if it is unseasoned?

2. LOW QUALITY. Even if the food had been spicier, it didn't seem to be of very high quality. The appetizers were very greasy. The appetizer platter was basically a samosa, a couple of potato pakora and a TON of onion rings. There was no paneer, no selection of pakora. The tikka masala was lumpy and not as smooth as I' ve usually had it. The chunks of meat were ginormous, making it necessary to cut them before eating.

3. NO CHANCE OF IMPROVEMENT. My boyfriend's brother told me after the fact that they are \"racist\" and won't serve your food spicy if you're not Indian. While I was there, I heard the woman tell someone on the phone (which she did NOT have the courtesy to tell me) that their medium is really mild. Seriously? What's the point of having a scale of spicyness? That's fine. I'll find another place that is willing to give me decent food.

4. THE PRICE. Rice is not inclued in your meal, so that's another $2.50 per dish ($3.50 for Saffron rice (not worth it)). The total for my food was $75. And while I was excessive in ordering, I did so in order to enable my mom to try all the wonderful things associated with Indian food. Huge waste. The channa masala at Trader Joes is $4 and tastes WAY better than anything I had here.

I'm so disappointed that this was my mom's first experience with Indian food. I feel like it's ruined for her forever. If you still insist on trying this place, I would recommend dining in so they can at least try to correct your order while you're there. Total disappointment.

UPDATE: I tried again this week (early September 2012), because I love Indian food so much, and maybe I went there on an off night or something. Boyfriend and I both ordered curries, and split plain rice, samosas, naan, and a mango lassi... (Side note: $42!!!) And it was _still_ not good. We both ordered our food hot, and while it had spice this time, it was spice without flavor. I can only assume that the only reason people claim this is the best Indian food in Cleveland is because it is the ONLY Indian food in Cleveland (at least on the further West Side). I seriously, seriously feel bad for y'all, because Indian food should be SO MUCH better than this. Trader Joe's has better Indian than this. For like, $4."}
{"text":"Had Indian in US.  Had Indian in UK.  Had Indian in Hong Kong.  Had Indian in India.  Take all that for what it's worth......and in the context of \"I've had crappy Italian in Rome\"....and this is some of the best Indian food I've eaten.  Excellent wine specials on Tuesday and Wednesday.....which means I've frequented probably a dozen times a year.....the staff are respectful and unobtrusive.....so if you want something, or a recommendation, or aren't sure.....Just ask them.  They won't impose and tell you what to order, so if this is a new cuisine for you, ask for their help."}
{"text":"Quiet and good.  They will make anything you want whether it is on the menu or not.  Service is good and wine is cheap. Tuesday and Wednesday  is half price wine night. Great chicken vindaloo."}
{"text":"Cafe Tandoor serves up wonderful, authentic cuisine that is healthy, consistent, and delicious.  We love the yogurt-marinated chicken tikka, the tofu and lentil dishes, cucumber raita, and saffron rice. Their mango ice cream is wonderful as well.  The staff is warm and genuine, and while the food is not cheap, we prefer it to many white tablecloth restaurants and to all \"previously-frozen now fried food\" chains.  These people care about quality and service.  We travel all over the world, but always delight in returning to our favorite Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, with a nice menu. Some people have complained about the price. My wife and I have used discount cards from Restaurant.com and it's made the meal much more affordable. They always honor the cards with no complaint. The service has always been good. Nice waiters and the owner always comes to check on how things are going. While not as good as some Indian places I have been to in other cities, for food in Cleveland Hts. it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"I have dined at dozens of Indian restaurants from California to Minneapolis to Florida and this is among the very best you will find.  This is far beyond the cheap Indian restaurants you find with generic oily \"curry\" that has no authentic indian spices.  Cafe Tandoor is the real deal with high quality ingredients and a real tandoor oven.  You can taste the difference, and yes, you will pay a little more for the real thing.  This place is a bargain for authentic Indian food.  Try the butter chicken if you are not familiar with the cuisine and go from there.  AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"There was a time when this place would get 4 stars. But for some reason, the quality has declined (or maybe I tried better Indian places, like Udupi in Parma). And I don't have a problem paying good money for good food. But this is mediocre food at a high cost. 

You'd think that a vegetarian would be able to find several choices here. No, sorry. 

You'd think that the tandoor-fired dishes would be divine. Nope. 

You'd think for the prices that you'd get some decent side dishes thrown in, as is fairly typical with Indian food. Nope, sorry. 

You'd think they could make your food spicy. Nope, bland only. 

The good: The naan is still the best I've found in the Cleve. I'd go there for naan and a lassi. 

The bad: I'm frantically looking for a place with comparable naan, since this place just is sub-par overall."}
{"text":"First time going there. Hubby and i took the day off and went there today for something different.  We LOVED it. Service was great. Sweet owner. Nice setting. Fantastic food. Everything was perfect...even the Indian beer we had. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly takeout experience. Chicken tikka masala is my go to but decided to get curry salmon which was amazing and a veg dish."}
{"text":"Been going to Tandoor since 1999.  Wife and i are vegetarians so plenty for us to eat.  She likes it spicy and i dont.  Be sure to let the waiter know your preference.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. We ordered paneer tikka, Dal tadka and garlic naan. Specially Dal tadka and garlic naan were awesome."}
{"text":"I must admit, of all the ethnic cuisines I've tried, Indian is probably the one I'm most ignorant with. The service was extremely pleasant and the food was delicious.  We had the vegetable smosas for appetizer which were great and very flavorful.  I was in the mood for a Beryani dish.  The person I was with tried a vegetarian cheese dish with a tomato/curry sauce (forgive me as I cannot remember the name).  She said it was fantastic as well.  I gave five stars because I am unfamiliar with Indian cuisine and eating here gave me more of a reason to expand my palate with it."}
{"text":"Best overall indian restaurant in NE Ohio . Price is slightly higher , but provides best quality food . Good service and location ."}
{"text":"I usually don't prefer to give negative review, but I changed my mind  after  yesterday's visit to this restaurant  .
 I ordered malai kofta  and garlic naan , my husband order chicken biriyani both were dreadful   . One of the staff who was serving us  , he asked  me about  taste   , I told  him  Panner rolls in the curry wasn't cooked at all ,gravy is pretty bland and I don't prefer to eat . he said that he  would check with chef and guess what his  answer is  \" This is the unique taste for this dish here \"   and he left that's it ,he showed up again after we paid the check . 
My husband asked Rita(most of the indian restaurants would give this side for biriyani)   ,they surprised me adding this  to the check for 3.50bucks ,we thought this was free and the staff who took the order  never mentioned it is chargable .
 After spending over 45 bucks I had to leave with empty stomach .  After my hellish experience I would really suggest any one to think twice before heading to this place"}
{"text":"Awesome Indian Restaurant. Very clean, peaceful, and a nice atmosphere. The waiter was very kind and humble, fulfilled all of our needs, and explained some of the menu. Our appetizer was great, the sauces were fun to try with it as well. We also got naan. I got the ground lamb naan, and my father got the garlic butter naan. Both were very delicious, and were served at the same time as our main course. Lastly, our main course was very good (I had the lamb curry, my father had a chicken one). It came with a heaping pile of complementary, fluffy white rice. Overall, LOVED THIS place. It was my first Indian restaurant I have been too, and now I hold a very high respect for the cuisine. I have no idea why there is any bad reviews.. most people post reviews when it was bad rather then good. TIP: Come at lunch, its nice, a great peaceful atmosphere, and the meal is perfectly portioned to make you full, but not kill you."}
{"text":"Too overpriced for the service and taste. The food had good variety but for that price there are better options in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good tasting Indian food. Recommend. Prices are reasonable. People are friendly. Been there a few times. Only complaint is service is slow."}
{"text":"This is really excellent.  I've happened to eat there a couple of times on two-for-one wine night on Tuesdays.  I highly recommend this place.  Plus, I really miss not eating Indian food more often.  India was part of my biz dev territory, years back, and I miss the authentic cuisine, which you can get in the UK , too."}
{"text":"Dinner is always really good here. there's not a ton of parking (except down the street). Just don't be in a hurry to eat, it's a slow process. A lot of variety, I've not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Butter Chicken and garlic naan. The sauce in the butter chicken was actually really really great. It was that perfect mix of sweet and savory with a touch of spiciness. The chicken, however, was very very tough- inedibly so. I ended up just pouring the sauce over the rice and throwing the chicken out....which defeats the point of ordering the chicken. The naan was good, not great."}
{"text":"My wife and I went late on a Wednesday evening.  Although the place was empty, the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was outstanding.  We ordered vegetarian samosas, a vegetarian curry, an okra masala and some naan bread.  While the dishes were on the small side, they had great flavor and texture."}
{"text":"The reason for thee stars is because the place needs some serious updating. The ambiance/atmosphere is kinda stale. 5 stars for the actual food though. I got vegetable shashlik and it was very tasty. There was 5 of us and everyone got different things, so we were all trying each other's food. It was very good. Will come back."}
{"text":"The worst of Indian food I have eaten till date. Will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"As near full-time vegetarian I eat a great deal of Indian food. I've lived in 3 major cities and in all my time eating Indian take-out (which is fairly frequent, I'd say monthly) I've never been charged for rice. So, spending 40 bucks for 3 veggie entrees and not having rice included is a no-go for me. For the price-to-portion ratio, I am GREATLY disappointed in Cafe Tandoor."}
{"text":"Worst Indian Food We ordered MutterPaneer & Malarikofta which was taste less Paneer was dry and peas was raw and in Malai Kofta all they did cut four pieces of Fried Potato and When I called them that its not Kofta Owner is like that's how they serve well I've advised that change your chef."}
{"text":"We have flip-flopped between cafe tandoor and Indian Flame as to which is our preferred easily accessed local Indian food.  After our most recent underwhelming experience with Cafe Tandoor, Indian Flame has won out.  Cafe Tandoor, while often quite good, just simply is not consistent enough for my liking.  They sometimes don't provide any rice and it is a bit pricey.  Ultimately, there is good food to be had from here, but other local options are better."}
{"text":"Namaste! Best Indian food hands down. I love cafe tandoor. I usually go as a special occasion like my birthday but then again, sometimes I just crave some Garlic Naan. Everyone is super sweet there and I haven't had a bad meal ever. The ambiance is nice, the place is clean and once, they even ave me a tour of the kitchen so I could see the tandoori oven. I watched the chef make fresh naan. That was cool. I suggest cafe Tandoor. Gets 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"This is a delicious Indian place! This was the second time we got takeout from Deliver Me Food and it was superb. While I can't say anything about the dining-in experience, the food is top-notch.

We have tried a bunch of dishes, but the butter chicken is probably the best. The malai kofta is a close second.

The naan is still piping hot upon arrival!

One word to the wise (as we weren't, the first time): order rice separately, because it doesn't come with the dishes. The only negative in my opinion."}
{"text":"Solid Indian food. Takes a few tries to figure out their spice level and whatnot, but definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch while shopping at Crocker Park.  We love Indian food, and have enjoyed it on three continents.

This food was seriously under-spiced and bland.  We ordered saag paneer and lamb korma, both to be spiced \"medium plus\".  There was no heat whatsoever, and we could not taste much of anything.  

Portions were adequate, but service was indifferent, even though there were only three parties in the restaurant.

Not impressed."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is slow. Very cold room temp atmosphere. Other than that cool."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with my wife on 3-21-14. The food was amazing and there was so much that we took home the leftovers and had a second meal that was 99% as good.  

We started with the vegetable samosas. The sauces were really flavorful.  We also really liked the aloo paratha.  So good!  Even the second day it warmed up well. 

I had the chicken tikka entree which was delicious. My wife had the vegetarian sashlik which she thoroughly enjoyed. 

We each had a drink as well. The staff was all over us but not in an overbearing way.  

Our bill, with the two drinks, was only $40.  We both agreed we need to come back frequently.  Or do takeout. This was a delicious meal and a bargain to boot.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We ordered butter chicken, medium hot. What I got was bland.Chunks of chicken in a sauce that tastes like Chef Boyardee, with NO spice whatsoever. Not to mention, the chicken tikka was 5 pieces of chicken on top of an entire sliced onion.... For $13.50! NO RICE INCLUDED! I grew up on Chicago Indian food and this place is just disappointing and I feel totally ripped off. I had to make my own rice at home. Never again."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer indian restaurants on the east side of Cleveland, where there is not a huge population of Indians and Pakistanis. 

Ambiance is well kept and maintained. It is welcoming and if you are lucky there is live music. Most of the vegetarian items on the menu are reasonably priced and taste good. I did not find anything extraordinary but nothing was yuk either. 

I will be going here regularly due to proximity to where I live and reasonably priced good food."}
{"text":"One word: yummm. Wish I had actually managed to snap a photo, but it was too late . This is a gem of a restaurant in Aurora and one of three in the area. If you are a fan of Indian food, this is your place. We are big fans of the samosa, and all the nan breads- we love the wheat and plain. And- their mint chutney is sooo good. Perfectly fresh and spicy.
As for food- it's really all good here ! The split tandoori chicken is so good with all of the fried onions . My kids get the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken-- always. The biryani is my personal favorite and I always get that with a lot of extra spice. 
Tandoor has some incredibly jasmine rice and I often find myself getting this to go -- solo-- when I make my own curry. It's way better than Anything I can whip up and I am a pretty good cook.
If you like desserts, the fried dough balls drenched in syrup and the best thing ever and . Prices are pretty reasonable and we usually eat for 110 and that's for 5 of us.
Just a great little place and cozy and perfect to go to if you love Indian cuisine ."}
{"text":"Food was extremely bland. Server never came back to fill our water glasses. Waiter never asked if we wanted rice - most restaurants include it, do it was a surprise when we found out rice was an extra. Should have realized that we were going to be underwhelmed when we observed that there was no one of Indian ethnicity eating here."}
{"text":"Cafe Tandoor has three restaurants in Cleveland Metro area. I have been to two of them and I must say that they are nothing special. 

The choices are ordinary and there is not much vegetarian food on the menu. I would like to see some more vegetarian items. Food is altered to make it more palatable to everyone. 

It was a nice stop, but my search for the good indian food continues."}
{"text":"Food is very good.   I have been here several times and being a vegetarian, I really appreciate the selection of menu items available.

The service is OK but a bit slow.   They come around, but not often enough when you are eating spicy food and need water!    I had to wait for water a couple of times.

Not much in the way of atmosphere.   I personally don't care about stuff like that, I am there for the food.

Overall, I like this place and recommend trying them if you like Indian food.   I will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"Try the tofu biryani-great flavor with the potato, rice and spices.  Typically a carry out place for me, though the dining room looks nice.  Of course, start with some nan and sauce- can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Always had good service here. 

Like others, I prefer indian food a bit more spicey, so I always order (literally always) the butter chicken with more kick. And yes, its damn good butter chicken and goes especially well with a side of the garlic naan and saffron rice. But judging from others' reactions the menu is a bit geared towards the curries rather than well... the Tandoori food. A bit ironic, but theres good food so its not disappointing.

Yes, they are a bit pricey, so I try not to go often, and if I do its usually with a person who wouldn't think less of me if I said \"you want to split the bill?\""}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here today and the food was very bland... I asked for medium spicy on the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken, they both were both mild. I paid for two orders of rice and only received one, which wasn't enough for the whole family. Don't think I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the BEST INDIAN FOOD in the Cleveland area.

I've been many times to the Westlake and Cleveland Heights locations.

The food isn't \"cheap\" but it's not overpriced either.  A great value for the money.

Flavorful and spicy.  Keep in mind, \"spicy\" doesn't always mean it's going to burn your mouth, it's just so full of exotic flavors and spices.  I do actually order mine to be extra hot for spice and it tastes incredible that way.

Great for vegetarians or omnivores.  

I've never eaten the lunch buffet here."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service this evening...over a hour to receive food.  Not a word or apology from our server.  I will not be returning.  This has used up a good portion of my evening.  Better ask the host if they can get your food in under an hour."}
{"text":"Solid quality Indian food. We had the chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, and chicken with almond sauce. All were good. The Indian cheese and pistachio ice cream deserts were great. I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Very, very tasty Chicken Tikka Masala.   My husband and I shared it, along with the good Roti and oh-so-light saffron rice.  We also split a chai.  We both raved over the dish and the chai was perfect.  

   Despite other reviews, this place was almost packed.  Maybe because it was Holi?

  My only complaint would be that our initial service was kind of odd.  We were seated and then kind of ignored, but their redeeming quality is that once we did order, we received our food within 10 minutes.  

   This was a refreshing culinary experience and was well worth the money."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with the boyfriend. Been to the one in Cleveland Heights, had to check out the Westlake location. Everything was fantastic, including the service!!"}
{"text":"The vegetable dishes are not bad. I had the chana masala, and it was okay. However, I would stay away from the meat dishes, as none of the ones I've had were serviceable. If you are hankering for indian, and saffron patch and indian flame are out of reach, would come here with lowered expectations."}
{"text":"I was having a serious curry craving, and I went to Cafe Tandoor knowing full well it might not be that great. I can't fault the service -- it was friendly and efficient. The ambiance was nice enough. But the lamb korma -- the tough chunks of meat came in a wobbly whitesauce-like mixture, kind of like a Campbell's \"cream of\" soup before water has been added. The saag paneer wasn't bad. But none of it was spicy; the korma was particularly bland. And the portion sizes were small for the prices. The mango lassis didn't have that rich yogurt flavor. I doubt I'll be back, expect for a takeout saag paneer when the craving hits."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food in Cleveland. Also Zydrunas Ilgauskus \"Z\" from the Cavs frequents here. 

Highly recommend the butter chicken and some garlic Nan!"}
{"text":"Positive & negative experiences all night long!  I've never had such an up and down opinion of a restaurant throughout the whole night!

First, I arrive before my friends.  I'm NOT an adventureous food eater and I'd never had Indian food before.  The guy who I'm assuming was the manager could sense my anxiety when it came to the menu.  He ended up putting stars on the menu next to my safest options.  He also went out of his way to take the time to explain a number of dishes.  But then we waited about 45 minutes to even order our food.  They took forever to bring us our drinks as well.  The food was great! I had the Butter Chicken which he said was their most popular chicken dish.  Delicious!  Afterwards the server gave us trouble with splitting the check when there were only four of us.  We had to again explain who had what dish.  Perhaps they were just having an off night, but their customer service was lacking with some employees.  The food,however, was great!"}
{"text":"It is always a rare treat when you walk into a restaurant and are treated like family from the first time.  The servers were immediately friendly, outgoing, and helpful with navigating the menus. The food smells and looks delicious, and I have no doubt that it is delicious. The scenery is nice, and the servers themselves are beautiful people. Experience something new and different, and come to this restaurant. Open your minds and open your hearts to what can be a new and delightful experience."}
{"text":"I got the Navratan Curry...it had no flavor at all. It tasted like tomato paste, some milk substance, and sugar. The Naan was okay...it may have been better had my order had been prepared on time. I pre-ordered online at 7:09 and my food wasn't ready until 7:47. The restaurant was less than 1/2 full so I'm not sure why there was a delay. Also, as I waited for my order, I overheard a rude comment from a waiter. A child approached the host area, and the waiter said to the host: \"I can't talk to this kid right now\" with the rudest tone. The kid only wanted to know where the bathroom was. 

Between the bleh food, time mismanagement, and the mean-spirited server, I would never come back. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nil with generic decor.  The service was initially fast with appetizers and drinks, but almost completely stopped for the entrees.  We waited 25 mins for our entrees.  However, the waitresses/management were friendly.   

Now let's get down to the real issue-THE FOOD.  

I was so surprised and disappointed with all the good reviews and word of mouth.  Their food wasn't anything special or good.  

We got a appetizer sampler with samosas, pakora, etc.  The samosa was ok and the chicken pakoras were delicious like Indian fried chicken nuggets.  I was disappointed with the lamb though.  The lamb was overly spiced on the outside, but bland on the inside. The house salad is super peppery and drenched in dressing.  

We tried their cashew chicken that was slightly creamy and reminded me of comfort food as I spread the chicken and the sauce over jasmine rice.  The other dish we had were the skewers/kabobs.  The chicken left something to be desired and was slightly dry.  

I did have a wonderful Brazilian beer though that was slightly sweet and bitter.

Maybe the chef had an off day, but I wasn't excited or impressed by the food.

It gets two stars for the chicken pakora and friendly staff.  However, the slow service and mediocre food/entrees brought the experience completely down."}
{"text":"If I weren't a kind and generous person, Café Tandoor would get a single star, but that just seems mean. I like to reserve space and hope for improvement, and it wasn't totally awful. I mean, I'm not vomiting or anything. 

My sweetheart and I were very much looking forward to our delivery order arriving. We eagerly opened our order of butter chicken, saffron rice, aloo jeera, and  bainjan bharthai. We happily spooned servings into our bowls and settled in for some deliciousness, except that it was, well, not delicious. 

While we had both ordered a medium level of spice, all of our dishes were bland. Actually, that's not entirely true. Both the aloo jeera and bainjan bharthai had a peculiar smoky flavor that we struggled to define. We finally settled on \"unpleasant\" and \"bitter\" and, we hope, \"not rancid.\" The butter chicken's flavor was better, in that it tasted like very dry, very bland butter chicken rather than smoky mystery spice. The rice was fine. Overall, the food was barely mediocre. 

For $50 and an hour's wait, this dinner was a big disappointment. We'll be looking for other options next time. On the upside, the delivery driver was nice."}
{"text":"The best Indian cuisine on the west side of Cleveland. Get the spicy lamb rogan josh, saffron rice, garlic naan, and mixed pickle. For diners who have a more tame palette, try the butter chicken with yogurt sauce. I like to get takeout here, but if you enjoy a more upscale dining room experience you might like to dine in."}
{"text":"This may not be the best Indian food you'll ever eat. That said, what I ordered was very good (butter chicken). I'd give the food 4/5 stars.

However, the service was amazing. Our waiter was very attentive, kind, and even humorous. It was definitely memorable and for that another star is earned. I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"The most delicious northern Indian cuisine. Friendly, accommodating and cozy-- love it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Indian food I've had in the United States and Canada. Most people would associat Indian food with a combination of immense flavor and some degree of accompanied spice. Neither of these two characteristics was to  be witnessed in our culinary experience of this establishment. 
We shared a Saag Paneer and Channa Masala, two basic and common northern Indian dishes that are very standard fare in any Indian restaurant. Both were completely tasteless with no spice at all. We asked for spicy by the way. As there was no salt or pepper on the table, why would you need it one might surmise, this being Indian food after all, these two condiments were sorrely missed. We also shared riatta which seemed a bit under fermented, more like plain yogurt with some chopped onions thrown in. 
I have NEVER had tasteless Indian food before in North America. No spice I understand but no spices is another matter. If this were someone's first time with Indian food they would walk away wondering what all the fuss was about."}
{"text":"I ordered food from Ubereats from this restaurant. The driver told me I had to pay for naan. Naan is given with dinners and I ordered 2 dinners. You have to pay 3$ for one naan piece when every Indian restaurant just gives them to you. This does not make sense to me. Bad business. The butter chicken tasted like Campbell's tomato soup. The chicken had a very bad taste to it. Like it was old or frozen for a very long time. I will not order from again. Makes no sense to have such bad things."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. Last week I had been thinking about their lamb biryani for a week and talked one of my friends into coming with me. For the first time ever, I left disappointed. The lamb was dry and the biryani wasn't as flavorful as it was in the past. Now, I need to find a new place to get that dish which is one I love."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner one day a little earlier than they were opening, but they still seated us. The waiter was very helpful when we asked questions about what to order. 

I was disappointed to find out though that none of their dishes come with rice or bread. You have to order each of those things separately. Even though its only 3 or 4 dollars, you'll rarely find yourself shelling out for just plain rice at other restaurants. 

The food was SUPER delicious and fantastically spiced. My boyfriend says it tastes very similar to the stuff he's had while he was in India. The portions were definitely not big enough. They come in small bowls and I definitely wished I had more. 

Overall, the place comes across as a fancy Indian place. They go light on the amount they give you and add charges to every single item (like rice). At the end of the night, you're either still a little hungry or a little more poor. But the great food will probably lure me back again."}
{"text":"Taste was horrible, not Indian at all. The cottage cheese (paneer) was hard as rock. Overall bad experience. We just left eating appetizers and one main dish. 

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Ok,, as an Asian descent, I expected a little more from this restaurant.  The food was good - we ordered one paneer dish and a lamb dish.  We assumed our order would come with rice or naan but everything was a la carte. The price was somewhat pricey given that we had to pay for our rice and naan - $3 for each. But the food was tasty."}
{"text":"So, I came to Cafe Tandoor with a group, and we had Lamb Biryani, Piratha, Naan, Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Maasala, and an Okra based curry.

It's actually the first S. Asian place I've been to in Cleveland.  Why?  Well, because all of my S Asian colleagues have told me that there aren't any particularly great places... except for their own homes.  Now why didn't I think of that?

Next time, I'll just self invite myself to their homes!!!

Still, one has to explore...  

Waitstaff are friendly enough, and actually rather courteous.  I've been to good places where the servers are convinced they are doing you a favour by coming by to take an order.  This isn't one of them... which probably means it's not really Indian.  :)

1/2 kidding.

The food was decent, but definitely not great.  Mild in spice, and spare in seasoning, the food was bland to my palate, when compared to other indian venues.

I think I drank some hot-sauce... there just wasn't enough spice in the prepared foods.

C'est la vie!

Would I come back?  If someone else wanted to come.  Otherwise, I'm looking forward to trying Saffron Patch."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for dinner and the food was outstanding! Wine chosen with the meal was a winner. Have ordered take out from here as well and always consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Food: Nothing special just average. 
Service: good
Price: pricey for the kind of food they serve
Ambience: Ok
Clean: ok

Would not go back."}
{"text":"Through the thickets and through the thine, comes this Indian restaurant thats mighty fine. A succelent lamb naan, saffron rice, and a lovely indian man that was oh so nice. Me and my friend Gary came here on a Wednesday, we were the only people, save for a steeple. Love the shrimp curry, great veggies too, go together like me and my boo. Free refills of diet coke, what a surprise, no proprietor thief in disguise. Gary had the lamb tikki, such a growing boy, he needs a dashiki. At the end of it all, there was fennel, rock candy, and nerds, oh what a treat!"}
{"text":"Cafe Tandoor is a good option for Indian food on the far west side of CLE. The restaurant is located in a nondescript strip mall right off of Detroit and Crooker, close to Crooker Park. Current state parking is a bit of a mess with new construction going on but still accessible. 

Our Thursday night dinner consisted of Curry Shrimp for my wife and the Garlic Shrimp (medium hot) as my choice of the evening. Basmati rice and Nan were ordered along with our meals. The shrimp in both dishes were cooked right, done but not rubbery. The spice and heat levels were spot on and to expected levels as ordered. Portion size seemed right for the price and while I did not have an issue with the rice being offered as a side I would prefer paying a bit more and having rice as part of the meal."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our final evening of my husband's work trip, Friday 10 June. What a great atmosphere, we were originally going to order takeout but upon noticing the full bar, we stayed. Haha! Our waitress was so sweet, and like another commented: unobtrusive, but helpful. We were originally given the regular menu, but upon asking about vegan options, she gave us the vegan friendly menu. Food was amazing. We got the vegetable pakora app, saag tofu, dal maharani, and aloo gobi (upon my asking her preference) with vegan roti bread. She was great at pointing out which options were vegan (condiments, breads). We used the Yelp offer at the time, which was great for the price! All of the staff was so friendly. I'm sure he'll be traveling back for work, and we will definitely be stoppingrby again."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosohere. The staff is extremely friendly! Everything we ate was cooked to perfection! Being the HUGE foodie that I am, I've never had a better experience eating indian cuisine. From san francisco and all the culture, cafe tandoor raises the bar for me! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CAFE TANDOOR! For all. Perfect for date nights, trying something new and family dining"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area.  The food is served family style so there is usually plenty to take home.  Some of the other reviewers on here complained about the amount of spice but I just tell the servers how I want the order to be when I order and I haven't been disappointed.  The food is excellent and definitely a great place to stop and check out"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but fairly solid Americanized Indian food.  In general the food tends to be mild enough for sensitive tongues  The lamb and chicken korma are both fairly good but stay away from the catfish."}
{"text":"This place is alright. But the food is really inconsistent. Some times the Chicken Tikka Masala is really good, sometimes it's kinda meh. Sometimes there are lots of onions and pepper in it, sometimes not. Sometimes the Butter Chicken tastes kind of metallic and the tomato flavor is overpowering, sometimes it's alright. I have to really be craving Indian in order to play the taste roulette game here. 

It's also a bit pricey because none of the dishes come with rice. So you really have to order two different things to eat one meal."}
{"text":"The prices may have gone up but the food is, as always, delicious. We prefer carryout and sometimes the person answering the phone is hard to understand but be patient. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Good food, enjoy the butter chicken and saffron rice. You can let them know how spicy you want your food, I usually get mine medium. Wednesday is half price bottles of wine awesome deal. The service is good."}
{"text":"Really good Indian, maybe the best in Cleveland. 

Appetizers:
- Veggie and meat smosas are both awesome

Entres:
- Alloo Jira -- my favorite, so tastey
- Aloo Ghobi - very flavorful as well
- Butter Chicken - pretty standard, but they do it well

Their naan and roti are also great as a bread item."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is to die for!  Maybe the best I've ever had.  One of the things I miss most about working in Westlake is being able to pick up from here for lunch.  Everything I've ever tried here was good but the butter chicken (butttaaaaaaa chickennnnnnn) is my favorite, especially with the saffron rice and some garlic nan to mop up the extra sauce.  The restaurant is very nice inside, and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for years and have always enjoyed it. The butter chicken is delicious. The garlic naan is warm and garlicky. The lamb shahi korma is tender and creamy. I've had at least of dozen different dishes and have always been quite happy with both the food and the service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Portion sizes are big and the prices are decent for good quality Indian food. The ingredients were fresh and the spice level perfect. For all those negative reviews talking about the taste: this is pretty much as a good as it gets, if you didn't like the taste then you probably just don't like Indian food."}
{"text":"This was pretty good! You have to pay for everything ala carte pretty much, so it gets pricey, but they do give you a lot of food. If I lived in the area I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland, particularly for for tandoori meat dishes so I hope this was just an off night. The meat was dry, we ordered several dishes Indian hot and they had no spice at all. The server virtually never came around. I expect it to take a long time for food when I order a mixed grill, but I split a beer with my wife and in 30-40 minutes it was not possible to order a second. Also nobody checked on us for quite some time so it was difficult to point out some of the side items we ordered had not come out.

The server was very nice though, but the night made for a frustrating experience given the built in 20% gratuity for groups of 5."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say. Wow. I'm sure I can cook better Indian food. 
Lamp kebab was not really a kebab but dry peace of lamb
and Malay kofta tasted like tomato sauce from the can.
Lentils soup was ok."}
{"text":"Favorite Indian Restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian food. Made the call later at closing they waited for me, however since the business is slow for this location prices go up. Chicken tikka masala , 2 Naans and rice came to almost $25 which is kind of pricey I looked at me I at store before owner/ cashier rang me up and noticed that prices were upped from the menu which is very odd , however considering that he stayed a little extra for me I was ok - another situation I would question him."}
{"text":"In town for business for 3 days and ordering from them a second time. The first time around I used Grubhub and they flubbed the delivery. I placed the order around 8:45 and about an hour later still no food and my delivery time kept getting pushed back. Long story short, I called the restaurant directly and the gentleman there was severely displeased with gh. He called them with me on the phone and let them have it because no one was coming to pick up my food and he said \"my customer is hungry and needs his food!\". 

He really went to bat for me (wish I could remember his name), had gh refund my order, and ultimately closed his store for the night and delivered the food to me PERSONALLY. He was every courteous upon delivery and refused a tip (though I insisted and gave it to him anyway).

To top it off, the mixed grill and biryani were both delish with hot level spiciness on point. Sorry, I was indeed starving, so no pics. Looking forward to having it again tonight....though not via gh!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to try new things and decided to give This place a try the other night. We were pleasantly surprised by everything we ordered and we found the service to be attentive without being intrusive. 

The fried cheese and fried onion appetizers are both very good, if rather simple. They are made even better by the selection of sauces they bring to the table. 

For our entrees, we ordered on of the lamb curries and the mix meat plate that offered a selection of several of their entree meats. Everything was cooked to perfection, very tender, juicy and flavorful. They tell you that they spice everything mildly but they are happy to add more spice if you desire. We found the dishes to indeed be mildly spiced but not at all without flavor. I would probably ask for a medium spice level the next time. 

We will definitely be back for many more dinners in the future."}
{"text":"Indian is my among my favorites and I love it extra spicy which is perfect for the winter. My stomach is made of cast iron, I suspect. I prefer southern indian over northern indian food. That said, Cafe Tandoor is a bit northern, where the sauces tend towards the creamy and sweet. It's the only Indian restaurant around where I live though. A bit Americanized, Cafe Tandoor is a great gateway drug to this regional cuisine for the uninitiated. If you've never tried indian food before, come in and order the butter chicken, saffron rice and garlic naan. Finish things off with a Gulab Jaman for dessert."}
{"text":"Very meh. We ordered carry out delivered from Uber eats for dinner. The food did arrive hot but was nothing great. The chicken tikka masala was some of the worst I've tried, the sauce was not creamy and lacked spices and complexity; it was more like tomato sauce with rubbery chicken. The lentil dish we ordered was better but still boring and under spiced. Part of eating Indian food is to enjoy the complex spice profiles and this food was missing that. The garlic herb naan tasted like it has that pre-minced garlic from the grocery store on it, really disappointing. Also, rice did not come with the curries so I was glad to have ordered some just in case. The food was disappointing and just sub-par but not awful, yet certainly not worth $30."}
{"text":"Okay... let's cover prices first. This place is significantly overpriced for identical portions as compared to others in the area like Tandul in Tremont or Jaipur Junction in Hudson. Chicken tikka was 14.50 compared to 11 dollars elsewhere, but here's the kicker... this place does NOT include rice like all of the rest. You have to also purchase that separate! Total sham! Second, the food wasn't that great. The butter chicken was overly salty and tasted terrible. The chicken tikka masala had peppers in it that overpowered the entire dish. Pass on this place and go to Ruchi which is only 1 mile from this place"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Delicious, filling, and my husband loved every minute of it. I orders the tandoori Chicken (some parts were dry) but it was great. My husband had the chicken tikka Marsala (delicious) our friend had a paneer dish (delicious as well) guava juice is delicious.Staff is amazing and chatted for quite a while with us. Def will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to satisfy your Indian food cravings and don't mind spending a little more for authentic cuisine, you can always eat at The Cafe Tandoor Restaurant situated on South Taylor, Cleveland Heights.  Service is excellent and fast. I walked in and sat at the bar to order take-out and I was greeted by one of the owners.  He was super nice, helpful and provided me much insight on entrees to try on my next visit.  For $40, I ordered 2 entrees of butter chicken, 1 side of basmati rice, 1 side of vegetable samosas and 1 side of naan bread.  I wish I could have taken pictures when I got home but I was so hungry and the food was so good, I couldn't stop eating. I definitely plan to come back soon and try his suggestions. Yes, the food is slightly expensive but with Cafe Tandoor being in business for over 25 years serving authentic Indian food and providing great customer service and cleanliness , I think it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the best authentic Indian food!!! It is the gem of Lee road! It is a great place for meat lovers and vegetarians alike!"}
{"text":"If you're like me and absolutely love authentic Indian food, GO HERE. I love everything on the menu. The food is five stars but getting a table is quite difficult so I have to give it a 4."}
{"text":"So Cafe Tandoor has gone up a star in my Yelp notebook! Some folks might wonder why, so here we go:
- We decided to forgo the usual bread and curry option for a biryani one the other day, and we were blown away with the quality of the food. It was amazingly good.
- Try the lamb biryani and the nentara biryani. These folks don't skimp on the lamb or the panneer/veggies in the biryani. The spice was just right.
- Not sure if they have changed chefs recently, but the food is way better than ever before. 
- The staff seemed very nice, mostly the same ones from before. Was surprised that my good buddy \"the manager\" wasn't around. Could that be the reason why the food was so good, I wonder?"}
{"text":"Pretty nice restaurant. Parking lot in the back tends to get full with all the Melt customers. Place is neatly kept, cloth napkins, real silverware, plants in the window. The service was polite and friendly. Ordered the butter chicken (love the sauce) the Navaratana curry (interesting mix of nuts, green bell peppers, tomatoes) and the paneer dish. The veggie samosas were tasty, but a bit hard. The garlic naan was quite crispy and really tasty. That was very impressive. Mango lassi was yummy too."}
{"text":"Cafe Tandoor is the first place I ever had Indian food, and for that it will forever have a special place in my heart. It's pricey, but it's good!

I've had the keema naan, garlic naan, roti, lamb biryani, shahjahani curry, and rogan josh. All of them are amazing, but the rogan josh is just on a whole different level. The waiter asked if I would like mild or spicy. It's Indian food, it's meant to have spice, so I ordered spicy. It was perfect! It was hot, but not overbearingly so. The balance of different spices is great, this is the way Indian food should be. With classical Indian music playing softly in the background (think Ravi Shankar) and the song of so many different flavors dancing on your tongue, you almost feel like you're in India, albeit a rather nice restaurant in Delhi."}
{"text":"Great Indian food on the west side. Conveniently located off of 90 in a shopping plaza. Friendly and helpful wait staff. Flavors are complex and delicate. I was amazed how they kept building on each other throughout the meal. We'll definitely be back, the east side doesn't have anything compared to this."}
{"text":"I've had Indian food a few times. I usually enjoy it as long as my mouth still has feeling at the end of the meal (spicy and I don't always agree). 

However.

One of the few reviewers in the far Southeast of Cleveland, I must regrettably bestow my first 3 star rating on yelp (ever) to Cafe Tandoor. Is the food good? Yup. Quite good. 

But I don't need to pay that much for Indian food. 

My girlfriend and I had a late meal on a snowy weekday, a sure way to have a restaurant to yourself in the 'burbs. That part was nice. Ambiance was calm and service was good. I had a tasty lamb dish, she had a grilled veggie platter. Samosas were  shared between us and were probably my favorite part of the meal.

When you're in the 'burbs there really aren't too many dining options. I would go back here, but with a plan and hopefully with a kind friend offering to pick up the tab."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Cleveland area! Tofo Navarantana and Oloo Jeera are amazing!! Get the Milton Park shiraz wine, it's excellent and very hard to find!"}
{"text":"Service was good not great but ok food not so good although the appetizer sauces are great. Won't be back. I just wasn't crazy about the menu I've had much better Indian food first time having bland Indian food. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland area. Awesome food. Made as per our instructions. Had been to this place 3 times and it each time it was consistent with their quality and service."}
{"text":"We've been going to Cafe Tandoor (in Aurora) for about 10 years.  It's always a good experience with excellent service and good food.

The pakora appetizers are a winner and their curries are very good.  I usually get it Indian Hot and it never disappoints.  

They also have a nice variety of vegetarian dishes and excellent selection of breads. 

Try the gulab jamun desert (sponge-cake like balls in syrup).  

Some nice beer selections as well."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews. My son took me to Cafe Tandoor for my birthday. I enjoyed it very much. Great service, delicious, fresh food and a really lovely atmosphere. We started with vegetable samosas which we enjoyed with tamarind sauce, mint ? chutney and pickled onions. Two of us ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, while my daughter ordered Rogan Josh, lamb curry. We also ordered garlic naan, mango chutney, basmati rice and aloo gobi. We asked for medium hot and it was perfect. Other reviews said it was expensive, but each dish came with a substantial serving which can be shared easily. We had plenty to take home. I'm a fan and will be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive, and the food was subpar. Just kind of boring, not much spice, in fact the sauce was just kind of wet instead of actually tasting like anything in particular. I also had a mango martini and it disintegrated over the course of dinner, until it tasted so bad I couldn't drink it anymore."}
{"text":"Cafe Tandoor is a great little Indian restaurant hidden in a shopping plaza dominated by a Marc's and Sears Grand.  It was fairly empty when I visited for a late Sunday night dinner, but it looks like they do a fair amount of take-out business.  The dining room has about 20 tables and more tables in what appears to be a party room.  They have also added 8 tables of outdoor seating in front of the restaurant, though unfortunately the best you can do is a view of the parking lot and Asuka, Radio Shack, Super Tan, and Caribou Coffee across the way.  Inside, each table has a dark red tablecloth topped with glass and lighted by a small candle.  A bar sits in the back of the room with three empty stools as if just to prove to patrons that alcohol is available.  Background music ranged from (what I assume are) traditional Indian tunes to new age piano pieces.

The Tomato Shorwa was a regular tomato soup with Indian spices and without the slight sweetness you often get with other tomato soups.  The soup took an extended time to bring to the table, as if the order caught them off guard.  It's a decent soup, but admittedly on the bland and simple side.  I would probably opt for something else on another visit.

The Cholle was very good--probably the second best chick pea dish I've had.  The chick peas are served in a dark curry with tomatoes and cooked just enough to get a little softness without becoming mushy; so many other places I've been seem to undercook their chick peas.  On request, I got the dish at a \"mild\" spice level (which is exactly how they delivered it), but its mildness did not at all slip into blandness.  The dish is great to mix with an order of plain basmati rice and/or together with nan.

The Garlic Naan--a circle (about 8\" in diameter) of the traditional bread with garlic and butter--came out of the kitchen piping hot.  A must-have in my opinion--the aroma as the nan was being delivered to the table was wonderful.

Service is friendly and relatively attentive, but not at all terribly quick.  It appears one server covers the entire restaurant, at least when it's not at all crowded.  These aren't high-end or innovative food items, but there should be a place in everyone's palette for solid traditional dishes."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, lamb bread is excellent.   I was surprised the one person said sometimes you have to wait for a table.   I go to Cafe Tandoor about once every other week for the past four or so years and have never had to wait for a table and I've gone on all days of the week.
Here's when you know a an Indian restaurant is good - there are always Indian people in their eating.   If that doesn't tell you enough, not sure what more.
My non-Indian taste buds think it's great and take friends from out of town there all the time."}
{"text":"Wasnt very good. My curry barely tasted like curry, actually more like tomato cream. Wasnt the worst food ever but some items were definitely overpriced. $20 for shrimp tandoori? Although it did look yummy (my friend got it)."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've ever had has been here in Northeast Ohio. Cafe Tandoor was good, but not the best. Had I not had the best already, Cafe Tandoor would pass muster, so I'll try to score it based on that idea. 

I was there as part of a large party (15 people), which is always a test of service. They did ok - despite the fact that reservations were made before the fact, and the restaurant wasn't very crowded otherwise (a few empty tables the whole time we were there I believe) - it still seemed they weren't quite prepared to handle our group. No terribly grievous acts, just a bit slow on the drinks, and a long wait for one of the dishes ordered. 

No specific complaints on flavor, but nothing stood out as spectacular either. My date and I shared garlic naan, bhindi masala, and butter chicken. (The butter chicken arrived about 20 minutes after all the other food had been served, with apologies and some extra naan to make up for it.) Everything was good, though a bit bland compared to what I'm accustomed to for Indian cuisine - even the garlic naan seemed a little lacking on the garlic. As others have mentioned, they do it mild style by default - my fault for not remembering to ask them to add a little heat I suppose. I'm not sure if the addition of the hot would have made a difference -- if I go back again, I'll try to remember that bit. The chicken was tender and good quality though, so I'll give them that at least. 

I won't go out of my way to make a trip back - but for dinner after a movie at the Cedar Lee, it will do."}
{"text":"I went to Café Tandoor for dinner with my family on my recent visit to Cleveland. Their butter chicken was the main reason for the visit as that is the best memory I have from my CSU days in the 90's. What can I say, they did not disappoint! Their butter chicken was just as great as I remember it! What was even better was that the manager/owner was so friendly and happy to learn that we came all the way from NJ to eat their food, he treated us so well and made it even more memorable! The food was great, service was fabulous, we would love to go back again!"}

I have been traveling to Westlake for 14 yrs and never tried it. 

As half Indian/Lebanese, this is a wonderful food experience. Love it.

Must try it."}

We also thought it was the best dish and dinner we have had in a long time.  My 9 year old picky eater even loved the food, especially the curry and naan bread."}
{"text":"We've eaten with you guys on multiple occasions and have always had an awesome experience. Your hospitality is always excellent. I'm obsessed with your naan and the onions you serve in the beginning of the meal. The tandoor Josh (lamb) is always cooked perfectly and so is the rice. The atmosphere is fantastic, the wait staff is always helpful and friendly. We will continue to come back to get our Indiana fix. You guys are great!"}
{"text":"When I moved to the area I was told that I just HAD to try this place.  Well I did, and while they do offer solid Indian cuisine, there are many other Indian restaurants in Northeast Ohio that do a better job."}
{"text":"Too expensive food. We ordered veg & chicken biryani and a starter which were very bland. Apart from that they also charge for Rita($3), which would be free in most of the Indian restaurants. One of the guy(staff) who served us gave a bad customer service. Think twice to step into this restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a savory selection of vibrant vegetarian dishes here as a pleasant change of pace, including the veggie samosa, aloo ghobi, and malai kofta. The service was excellent and the authentic ambiance also appreciated. I'll be sure to test the Tandoor (Oven) on a near-future visit."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of spicy Indian food but decided to give it a try and started with place everybody was excited about.
Atmosphere of the place was nice, restaurant was spaceous, I love sthe tablecloths and attentive service. Food was good and fresh but not all that zesty or exotic. House salad was made with discounted cucumbers and spiced up with paprica and dressed with oil and vinegar. Chicken was bright orange but still tasted just like regular roasted drumbsticks. I constantly had a feeling I could whip up such a dinner at home given a right recipe.
The rest of the food was averagely good. Alcohol drinks also felt somewhat discounted but would get you drunk I guess. 
Prices were outrageous. Over $100 for dinner for two (shuld have at least included man with a snake or swallowing the fire show).
Definetely didnt feel like trip to India."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Cafe Tandoor and I loved it. I had the veg eggplant dish, veg samosa, naan and white rice. My friend had a chicken dish. The server was incredibly nice and made good recommendations and was able to explain dishes well.

Negatives- despite ordering the second hottest level, it was not spicy at all. It's also pretty silly rice is not included in the cost. 


Would come back."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant in the US, and I'm a world traveler. Used to rate a 5, but the flavors aren't so flavorful anymore, not just the hot spicy, just the curry isn't as complex as it used to be. Last two times I was there I asked for a 9 out of 10 on the spicy side, and Indian food is supposed to be hot anyway. It was mild. I don't mind paying what they charge when they get it right, but when I microwave my leftovers and add cayenne pepper and it's better that way, that's just wrong."}
{"text":"I had the tandoori mixed grill 20.50 and the tandoori prawns 23.50.  burned naan 2.00 (see pic). butter sauce 3.00. Very expensive. Nice flavors. Lots of food. All the meats in the grill were dry and tough. I used a certificate. I would have been very upset if I paid full price for this. It's sitting in the fridge. Not even sure that I'll reheat it. Trying to think of a way to repurpose it.  May go straight to trash.... Be careful if ordering by phone. I ordered the 13.50 prawns and he made the more expensive ones,  and I thought he said the sauce and bread were free but he was saying three. He didn't charge me for the mistakes. that was awesome! The sauce was like a tomato sauce, not very tasty. Def won't go back"}
{"text":"Café Tandoor is sort of like that slightly strange, but always reliable friend. I have eaten in and ordered take out from here quite a few times. I keep coming back because good Indian food doesn't exactly lie within the specialty of the local suburbs. Let me start by talking about eating in.

This is where the strangeness of the friend comes in, Café Tandoor looks just about like any 'family owned' place would if it were located in a strip mall, but there is one strange, distinguishing factor: It is ALWAYS empty. I'm not exaggerating either; at any given time you can come into this restaurant and expect that you will have the place to yourself, save perhaps maybe two other tables...out of the twenty free. I am not saying this is a bad thing, but if you're not looking for a (very) quiet, relaxed, and solitary dinner, don't eat in here. The service is usually good, nothing to complain or rave about. They are very good about filling up drinks though... 

Onto the reliable part, Café Tandoor's food quality is always consistent and always filling. There has not been a single time where I did not get exactly what I was looking for. If you want something other than the usual pizza and breadsticks take out (and have a little more scrilla in your pocket) hit up Café Tandoor. In terms of take out, portions are good, they always get your order exactly right, and the quality is never compromised. Your belly WILL be satisfied, your wallet on the other hand, may not be. I concede that for what you get, this place tends to overcharge just a little. Not a biggie, just watch what you get and don't be a regular! 

Overall, I would definitely suggest Café Tandoor to anyone in the area looking for something a little different but satisfying. Just remember what I said, strange but reliable, make sure you're looking for what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant ever, ordered a meat samosa and it was so hard I couldn't even eat it, it felt like I was eating rocks. Not worth your money."}
{"text":"Great variety of dishes to choose from. The butter chicken was delicious! Service is wonderful and attentive. Surprised the dining room is not packed. This is a jewel of a place in CH/UH area! Tuesday's = 1/2 off bottles of wine."}
{"text":"What Indian place charges additional for their rice when you order their curry/tikki masala dishes??!!! Seriously!?! And the price is HIGHER than average. $14 for a dish and pay additional for rice.  Naan I can expect to pay extra. And they don't give you any chutney to start. 

VERDICT: drive 10-15 min go to a better Indian place in Rocky River or Tremont"}
{"text":"Lovely food! Relaxing ambience.. Will come again definitely.. Keep it up cafe tandoor!"}
{"text":"Food outstanding, one of the best Indian in Cleveland.  Wait staff attentive and good in explaining options.  Spacious atmosphere with good acoustics.  Easy off I-90 in Westlake with close in parking.  A must if you like Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Hopefully your jaw has been getting some serious practice lately because biting into a piece of their lamb is quite an experience. Tough and fatty cut of lamb that was not tasty at all. 

Also, the portions are not proportionally sized. There was a tiny amount of meat and a ton of vegetables and rice. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Soooo torn on this one. We came to Tandoor after seeing a movie at the neighboring Cinemark. I am going to break down this one by category.

Ambience: Overall, this restaurant has little to no ambience. We were sat next to a booth that had a sloppy patch job of gray tape on the seat. I could not stop staring at it. Our booth was nestled into a corner with overgrown, dead plants dangling into the backrest. Odd.

Service: Very slow. We only saw our server once and had to ask the poor high-school food runners multiple times for water (people eating spicy food always want more water). Make sure you plan your visit accordingly with extra time if you need to be somewhere.

Price: I never mind spending money while out (after all, we came out, didn't we?), but I found the prices to be steeper compared to other Indian options in the area. Also, a simple side of white rice that typically comes with many traditional dishes is extra. Just a pet peeve.

Food: This was probably the best butter chicken i've ever had. The tomato and butter sauce was the creamiest, richest, most delicious thing ever. Order it with a side of naan and just wipe the dish clean... it is that good. We also had the shrimp curry... big pieces of shrimp, but just OK. Go for it spicy if you're thinking of ordering it, as the mild spice is very plain.

Overall: I'll probably order take-out next time. I can't stop thinking about that butter chicken."}
{"text":"Cafe Tandoor satisfies my indian food cravings in Cleveland. 

The samosas are huge and have a thick crust. (I prefer a more moist (and oily) version). I would recommend the vegetable samosas over the meat ones. Very good with the cool mint sauce.

Not a big fan of tandoori in general, so I can't say anything about that. But the naan and curry dishes are quite decent! (I like the lamb korma)

I never have to make reservations here- just walk in and there's plenty of room. Wait staff is nice and attentive. All around consistently good experience.

{"text":"The place to be for veggie Indian cuisine.  I met no resistance in making my dish vegan!  Wonderful service and a great selection.  From the samosas to the rice dishes to the naan...you are good to go.  Easy to just walk in and grab a table or they have a delivery service available online.  Don't forget the coupon (see the other review)!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the food at Cafe Tandoor.  If you're new to Indian food, this is a great place to start.  Service is always great.  Parking however, is a big challenge.  Street parking is almost non-existent, and the only lot is across the street with only a handful of spaces available (that I think may actually belong to another business)."}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is.  Takeout portions are very very small.  Two Chicken currys, dal, rice and bread is over 50 bucks takeout.  Dine in is similar. Its a shame, having good Indian close to home would be awesome, and maybe the reason why there is never anyone in this place.

The food is pretty bland - order something extra spicy, and there is no heat.  Even their garlic naan is pretty blah - they managed to even make garlic taste like nothing.  There is much better indian food in Cleveland, it is just a longer drive.  If they lowered prices, and found a way to add some flavors to their bland food this place could be great."}
{"text":"This is my go to Indian place in Cleveland.  The food is always great and the service top notch.  The prices are fair and portions could be a bit bigger but they are consistent with most high end Indian restaurants.  Every time the voice in my head says time for Indian, Cafe Tandoor is my first choice."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre Indian food. Nothing special at all, certainly nothing to justify their prices. Finally, they charge for rice. That's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Disappointed by lack of service (maybe it was an off night?).  I also felt frustrated to find that you pay extra to have rice with your meal.  The overall price doesn't match the atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here...  didn't know what to expect... it's excellent Indian cooking... very quick, great service."}
{"text":"Clean, nice and peaceful atmosphere during lunch and good service.  I agree with other reviews that there wasn't as much flavor as you would expect from the cuisine.  I ordered my lamb sag med-hot and I don't think it would even register as mild.  I enjoy Indian not just b/c the level of spiciness clears your head, all the spices together make you feel rejunivated after.  I would return for the cleaniness, and attentive service but wouldn't rave about how great the food was."}
{"text":"I orded takeout today after waiting a couple of years to try their food (prices are high). Had the mutter paneer, garlic naan, and rice. The garlic nan was well above average in fluffiness and flavor, which I would give a 5. The rest of my food was about a 3.5 in comparison to other Indian sit-down restaurants in Cleveland but the prices bring me back to a 3."}
{"text":"I'd been here a year ago and had a tremendous meal.  I had the Boti Kebab \"Marinated lamb kebab, served sizzling with onions & bell pepper\" The entrée came out sizzling as advertized with a wonderful aroma and flavor.  Also had the garlic nan which was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside just like nan should be.  Also enjoyed a mango lassi which was a nice soft compliment to the spicy food.  Detected a bit of cardamom which was a nice touch.  Was less impressed with the rice than I was last time, but I definitely enjoyed my meal overall.  Ordered some chicken tikka masala to go (was for my wife who was stuck eating an overcooked filet at a conference meal).  Even cold the chicken tikka masala was quite tasty.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and the prices were right on par with what I expect to pay at a comparable Indian place."}
{"text":"Excellent paneer dishes. Naan bread was microwaved though. Haven't gone back since its 3x over priced. If it were cheaper I'd eat there every week!"}
{"text":"One of my family's favorites for many years. Hot plates, excellent food, friendly staff. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last night service is good and the vegetable samosa was passable but I ordered my shajahani curry to be medium hot and it was mild at best. My wife's chick pea dish was also devoid of flavor and spice. I would not take a curry lover there!"}
{"text":"It seems you either love or hate this place and I can't seem to understand why. I've never received bad service. Each time I took friends with developed palates it was a complete hit!

It's worth mentioning that I've had Indian food in several major cities and I consider Cafe Tandoor a forimtable challenger to even the best. Their butter chicken is second to none in my opinion. I like spice and realize that most foreign restaurants Americanize their recipes a little. So I ask that my order has a little more punch 

Still, I find scathing reviews.

If yelp allowed partial stars, I'd give Cafe Tandoor 3.5. I think it's seriously worth a try. I suppose it's possible that they have good and (apparently) terrible days but I don't understand how I've managed to dodge the bullet so many times."}
{"text":"Before I go to any INDIAN restaurant I always check reviews on YELP. CAFE TANDOOR by far has the WORSE Indian food I've ever eaten in last 22 years. The service was lousy the food absolutely horrible & it was way over priced. It is very clear to me the folks who have rated this restaurant as a 4 STAR absolutely have no experience when it comes to INDIAN food. This place will not survive in city like Chicago,NYC,Houston,Dallas,Los Angeles etc. My experience was so bad I can't even give it a STAR. I tried to post it but it won't post without a star but folks you don't have to take my word for it . This place really sucks bad."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with a friend today (10/30/11) .  It was absolutely wonderful!  We ordered the salmon and a chicken dish serves over rice, and lamb curry.  We also ordered garlic naan, plain naan with a trio of chutneys/sauces and some hot chai; then we finished by haring a bowl of the best coconut ice cream I've ever tasted!
Everything was perfect; the waitress was very calm, attentive, and kind; the manager/owner also inquired as to if we were enjoying our dinner.  
The happily boxed the lamb curry to-go order for our friend, as well as our copious leftovers (they give a lot of food!)

Only cons:  parking lot is annoying, metered and was packed
Rice and naan were extra $
Even with the amount of food you get, the place is pretty pricey.

All in all, the atmosphere is calm and welcoming; lots of colored candles were lit and nice photographs and statues.  Music is quiet and calm; customers were quiet and calm.  When we arrived, the place had a few tables taken; when we left, it was packed with smiling people.

I really had a great time here, I will definitely be back!  :)"}
{"text":"I never really go to Indian restaurants but this place had a lot of flavor in their dishes. It is a little pricy but if you are the area and craving Indian food, I would stop by here. Now, on the spicy factor, their hot is not hot at all for me compared to other Indian restaurants I have been to. Also, you have to order rice and naan separately as it does not come with your order like other restaurants."}
{"text":"I love going to this hole in the wall Indian cuisine. The service is always wonderful, and the atmosphere is so calm and serene. I enjoy that it is a \"phone free zone\", it truly allows my fiancée and I to appreciate the moment without distraction. We've ordered something different every time we go to tandoor -- and the food is always incredible. It is made and prepared exactly as you order. The wait time here is longer than most places as a result of each dish being custom prepared, but is worth it and the time flies when in conversation with your date. I cannot say enough good things about this place -- it is our favorite place to go on a date and \"unplug\"."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a little dark, but I understand it for an authentic Indian restaurant. The staff is average, but I would like someone there who understands allergens a little more. The Indian candy dishes on the host table looks years old, and the booths and chairs are very 80's banquet hall. The food is better than average, but I do not sit down and eat meals here as it is not my favorite type of Indian food and tastes. The food is also a little overpriced for the ingredients, but I understand that some Indian spices and ingredients are expensive to buy and keep in stock in the USA. About once a month, I do come and get an order of vegetable samosas for takeout, and I enjoy them very much. I could definitely not eat them more than that; they are very greasy. But again, $5.95 for two average sized samosas full of potatoes and peas is overpriced. The restaurant is easily accessible from I-90 at Crocker and from Detroit Road. It is in the Marc's Plaza across from the Promenade, where parking is plentiful!"}
{"text":"Coming in from LA to visit friends and family and we wanted some Indian food. I have to say we were quite impressed. We had the curry catfish, chicken tikka masala and the Rogen Josh. Also had the paneer potatoes,  lentil dish and garlic naan. Everything was fantastic. My belly hurts from eating too much. I was so hard to stop eating! If you are craving some Indian food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"OVER PRICED, PAY EXTRA FOR RICE AND NOT MUCH ELSE IS NICE! 

Sorry for the rhyme but it works for this place. 

I had the absolute highest hopes for this place.  I've been to almost a dozen other Indian restaurants and take out between Cuyahoga and Summit counties and this one has been the MOST disappointing.  This establishment has such high potential but it's so many little things that affect this restaurant from being a wonderful place.  

But where to start with ALL the things that could be better.  I'll just start at the beginning.  I don't know how others have felt exactly and after reading the reviews it does sound mixed but the overall appearance and ambiance of the restaurant can be nicer but it does have a slightly inviting look to it, but that's my opinion.  It just feels like something is missing like a better color scheme for the dining room or different lighting but those plants along the tops of the booths HAVE TO GO! 
We were seated at a booth near the back of the restaurant and it was actually comfortable with no noticeable flaws in the lining or material and looked and felt clean.  We were handed menus and immediately taken back by the prices so we took our time and I told everyone to not worry and to please order what they wanted.  I wanted to treat everyone to this place and as anyone who is paying for the occasion you almost automatically have high hopes & expectations.  
We ordered beverages and upon receiving them we were given cans.  Yes, we were given a SINGLE can of soda with a glass of ice for $2.00.  This meant NO FREE REFILLS and that was very off putting right away.  A restaurant that has so much potential is going to charge the highest price I've ever paid for a can of soda?  I wasn't happy about that as most restaurants have a soda machine and free refills at that price. It's also hard to understand how any restaurant can give someone cans unless it's either take-out or the soda machine is broken/down.  
We still were optimistic as this was the first issue we came across (but there were more to come by that I don't understand).  As I mentioned the prices were high.  What made these prices actually appalling was that EVERY OTHER INDIAN/MIDDLE EASTERN RESTAURANT includes rice with their main entree's but not this establishment!  Nope, we only found out because my friend actually happened to ask about the amount of rice that came with our choices and the waiter replied, \"Only the Biryani dishes come with rice, all the other dishes do not include rice, it's extra.\"  WHAT?!?!?  Are you serious??  That should be listed and mentioned on the menu as every other Indian/Middle Easter restaurant I've eaten with/at includes rice!  It's pretty much expected unless otherwise stated but that wasn't mentioned. At these prices it's almost offensive and the owners here should be slightly ashamed of themselves because after reading many previous reviews they should LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS and understand that rice is relatively cheap at the Asian/Oriental markets I shop at.  Where are they buying their rice that they need to charge customers extra? It's not just one or two dollars either, the cheapest side of rice is $3!!  The waiter then went on to say that one order of rice \"should feed all of us\".  We ordered the Saffron rice for $3.50. No, it BARELY served all of us.  I had such a small portion (three spoonful's to be exact) and that was all I was able to get from this \"serving\".  I was really disappointed in all of this as it was just unnecessary and completely gave a bad impression of this place that all they cared about was charging for everything. 
The ONLY redeeming factor that gave this place TWO stars being the food is pretty good but I have to admit, I've had better.  As this is just my opinion, the Paneer Makhani I received was good but I've had better (Cleveland Tiffin on Warrensville Center Road makes this dish as well and it was excellent there!). 
At the end of our dinner, we had 2 cans of soda at $2.00 a piece, the vegetarian platter that was $8.50 and kind of disappointing (one samosa for 3 people? One piece of fried paneer and a bunch of little fried pieces with dipping sauce), a side of Saffron rice for $3.50, Paneer Makhani for $11.50, Tikka Masala with the substitution of lamb for $14.50 and the Rogan Josh which was another lamb dish curry style for $14.50 along with a side order of Garlic Naan bread which came out to what should of been $60 according to their high prices but that was before I found out there was tax on all of this that added up to over $65 and some change!  I will NEVER come here again until I see or hear they are under new management because this was supposed to be a nice treat for my friends and I. 
Overall, two stars because the food wasn't bad but all of these charges for \"extras\" and just the way the servers and waiters present themselves (and the chef not pictured or presented on website?) we were disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"My favorite Chicken Tikka Masala in all of Cleveland. The service is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great vegetable samosas! Paneer is excellent and lamb Benoni is to die for! Can't forget the garlic nann!!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.   Food was bland.  I even got medium and it tasted very flat and mild.  No pizazz.  We asked our server several questions about the menu items and she said she didn't know.  We were like, okay.... And then my daughter accidentally dropped a piece of her tandoori chicken so we told another server and he didn't care.  Didn't offer a replacement piece or anything.  The icing on the cake for us was they charge you extra for rice.  Never in all my life has plain white basmati rice been an up charge at an Indian restaurant.  Never going back!"}
{"text":"I found the indian food to be tasty and fairly well priced.

I split the Grilled Plate with my girlfriend. It was full of tandoori cooked meats: chicken, lamb, and beef. All very good-tasting with lots of classic indian flavor (without being overly hot).

I also had the Aloo dish (spiced potatoes) which was very filling and very generous portion.

Lastly, as always, I ordered some naan. The bread was soft and warm, however, it wasn't the most flavorful naan I've ever had.

The menu was all al carte which meant that to get a full meal you had to order numerous items. I think if their menu had full combo offerings (and was a tad cheaper) (and slightly better naan) I would have given it four-stars.  So really it's like a 3.5"}
{"text":"BEST Indian food in Cleveland, hands down.  I frequent here a couple times per month and the food is great, great service and nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered veggie briyani and chicken tikka masala, both regular spicy level (because other places like indian flame give you some insanely spicy food!). Usually, I'm sent to the crazy nirvana when I taste Indian food. Instead, I experienced rather bland, unimpressive taste with not much punch of the authentic Indian elephant sized scent and depth of the Hindu goddess. First thing I thought when I tasted the briyani was, \"Why am I still worried about my bills? And why does this taste so sweeeet?\"

Steer clear. This is Americanized Indian food. That's why they also charge extra for rice. The American way baby! Like the American cars, the engine never got revving."}
{"text":"Fabulous Indian food! It's a little expensive though, because with most dishes you pay extra for rice or naan. It is worth it!  Don't miss the Paneer Makani, Chicken Tikka, Saffron Rice or naan."}
{"text":"I liked the ambience and the staff are friendly. The food though tasted like everything was taken from the frozen food aisle of a grocery store. Butter chicken tasted like really bad pie (you read that right) and Ras Malai was served straight from the freezer. Chicken Biryani and fried shrimp were mediocre at best and Garlic Naan was ok. I'd like to think that the chef was having a bad day and the food is generally better like the other reviewers say."}
{"text":"Like their chicken curry but their naan is just very plain. Mango Lassi is also not that great."}
{"text":"For the second time I had overlooked dry chicken in a curry sauce. The sauce sat on the top of the flavorless chicken. When I told the waiter he said sorry..... Luckily the sauce was good and I simply ate it with rice and left all the chicken!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out using deliver me food on 11/26/16

Pathetic 
Ranks amongst the worst tasting Indian food I have had
And I am Indian!
Will avoid"}
{"text":"You know it's a bad sign when the Indians in the restaurant order the same thing and receive a completely different spread from the non-Indians.  This was very bland for a cuisine that is based on intricate spice combinations and vibrant flavors.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE their chicken tikka!!!   The entree size stretches out to three meals for me, along with their saffron rice...YUM!!  They heat the plates before bringing them to the table, a very nice touch.  Service is usually pretty good, but on a few occasions when the place is crowded, service can be slow, but I forgive because I love their food so much!

The location on South Taylor may not look like much from the street, but do not let that keep you from checking this place out.  One word of advice, parking is metered until 6 pm on the street and in the side/back parking lot."}
{"text":"When I was prego I was craving indian food so my husband and I went here! This did not fulfill my craving at all!  The food was bland and The portions were so small and it was super expensive for what you got!! I wish it was better Bc if it was I would be there all the time! Also the reasturant looked like a ghost town!"}
{"text":"DONT LISTEN TO ANYONE THAT GIVES BAD REVIEWS HERe...clearly they never have been to a nice indian restaurant! First of all ...the restaurant itself is hard to locate..it is in a little plaza by Marcs and K-mart! When you first walk in ..you can smell the fresh air of indian food and the comfortability of the atmosphere. Then you are greeted by friendly staff that smiles and seats me and my finance. The server seems as though she does not speak english fluently but she does know what kind of food to suggest and also the their martini are delicious. One of the first thing I feel in love with is their condiments that come with their appetizers. Their vegetable pokras and shrimp pokras are delicious with the red chutney. Their main dishes butter chicken and rogan josh and also aloo gobi is way beyond flavorful. And i LOVE LOVE Their Bread. Garlic nan to aloo paratha. Overall I believe this is the best best indian food you can find in OHIO !!! and the atmosphere is very relaxing and the staffs care about what they do and are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Tandoor especially the chicken jalfrezi and Rogan Josh.  The atmosphere is friendly and casual and the wait staff outgoing.  I've never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"So happy to have good Indian food nearby! Its hard to find in Cleveland, but everything Ive had here has been delicious."}
{"text":"The food is alright not best.... service is horrible and they're kind of a rip off you have to pay for rice if you order butter chicken for example... otherwise it's served with a spoon only not to mention they're portions aren't fair for the price"}
{"text":"The chicken jalfraizi was super sweet. The navarattan korma was extremely sweet too. It seemed like both the curries were cooked in the same base sauce. It was hard to distinguish the taste between the two dishes."}
{"text":"Saturday night the restaurant was packed. Thank goodness we made a reservation. We were craving Indian, and as usual, the food and service was good.  I had a Tassi drink. Tasted like milky mango. Refreshing. We had a Tandoor meat platter with all meats on it that were very good. My lamb dish was mild and tasty. We started with fried veggie triangles. They were the best of all. Curry veggies with a little spicy heat. We took half the food home. So good. See my photos."}
{"text":"Best Indian in CLE! I have been coming to this location for a long time. Honestly, I have tried so many Indian restaurants and Cafe Tandoor is the most consistent. I always know what I'm going to get and the taste is perfect. I can't say the same for the other places I have been. 

Tonight I ordered butter chicken, saffron rice and buttered naan. It's my favorite. Delicious and there is always some for leftovers. 

The interior is a bit dated. Lots of fresh plants and Indian art grace the walls.  They could use a face lift here, but I would not hold It against them. I'm here for the food, not decor. 

They staff is always very nice and the food is always good. I recommend ordering extra naan and a mango lassi drink. It's delicious."}
{"text":"I have tried several different Indian restaurants in the area, and I would consider this the best Indian restaurant this side of Cleveland.

The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza, but it really feels like you are in a different location once inside. The atmosphere is quiet, there is no TV, and the door even has a sign on it asking you to put away your cell phone. The decor of Indian imagery is a nice touch, without being over the top.

I found the menu to be quite extensive. I have brought different people with me each time I have gone, and each time, everyone loves it. (Friends ranging from Vegan, to people who have never had Indian food before) Everyone I have brought has been able to find a dish to their liking. If you aren't familiar with Indian food, there are some good descriptions of each dish to explain what it is, and most of the spices are a little on the mild side.

I've tried several dishes, and would pick the Rogan Josh as my favorite. The lamb was incredibly tender, and the spice was flavorful, without being overly spicy. (I ordered mine Hot-Hot)

The service is fantastic, and always friendly to help. The food does take some time to cook, so do expect a little bit longer than traditional American faire. (It's worth it) Taking the time to enjoy some masala tea with friends is one of the best parts of going to an Indian restaurant.

The pricing seems reasonable to me (Close to 20$ after ordering an entree, tea, a side of naan, and a side of rice). The dishes are served platter style, and you are given a plate. This encourages sharing, as the servings are large enough to share. There is also a modestly priced lunch menu if you make it there early. (They do close mid-day)

Those looking for some sort of off the charts spicy food might not be satisfied, but if you are looking for a wonderful Indian restaurant in the area, this is the one."}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever come back. At first they served us a tray of like onions and two sauces. There was a hair, so we told them and they took it back, they got us a new one, ALSO with hair!!!!!!!! We told them again, and they took it book. But honestly, how disgusting, and when I went to the bathroom I peeked in the kitchen and no one was wearing hair nets. Never again."}
