{"text":"Tried Prairie Fire for lunch today. While there wasn't anything bad about this place there wasn't anything spectacular either. I had the burger on a pretzel bun. The pretzel bun was tasty and I would enjoy it again. The burger was okay, they didn't ask how I wanted it done so I expected it medium which it was but I would have preferred them asking what temp I wanted. The chips were good but I would suggest adding cajun spice or something to make them more appealing. The fries are not good. The Garden Burger is actually tasty but nothing that would make me go back. We might try it for dinner sometime.  Service was okay but they could be better."}
{"text":"Tried it yesterday evening at 5:05 PM. Over priced menu items. Ordered the Mexican cheese dip as an appetizer only to be told a full 20 minutes later that it was \"not available\". Really ? Why is it on the menu ? I had smothered chicken while my wife had chicken strips. She seemed ok with hers but mine looked and tasted like it just came out of a microwave bag. Our server seemed disinterested and didn't know the menu. Servers in general were standing around talking to each other (place was mostly empty) so you would think service would be prompt. But no. A hostess (mgr?) had to come by the table and ask if we needed drink refills. Our server eventually came back to clear the dishes. Didn't ask if we wanted desert or the check or a kick in the head. Had to physically track him down to get our check. Very disappointing experience. It will be a long while before I try it again."}
{"text":"Had the pork steak(this was not what they wrote on the menu, I forgot the exact name) with peach BBQ sauce. Taste was somehow not very good. But can't tell what's wrong. The salad bar they bragged was just so-so. You can have 20% off if you have an i-card. Not sure how long this discount lasts."}
{"text":"The decor isn't much different from when it was Friday's.  We found the menu to be a bit confusing.  $3 for the salad bar was definitely not worth it.  The good was just so-so.  We were told it'd just a $2 charge for the salad bar if you were exchanging one of your sides for it (kind of ridiculous) yet they still charged us $3.   Unfortunately there wasn't anything special that would cause us to return."}
{"text":"Dined there tonight with my wife. Shortly after sitting down a buddy of mine was walking out with his family. I asked him what he recommended and he said he wouldn't recommend ordering anything special like ribs or a steak and advised to stick to something standard.   Upon his advice I ordered a French Dip and my wife ordered a burger on a pretzel bun with bleu cheese and bacon. Burger came sans bacon and when the server set my French Dip down I cringed. My sandwich was sliced Oscar Meyer roast beef with carmelized onions, Swiss cheese and a cup of beef broth. It was disgusting. The burger was frozen meat and not good at all. The appetizers were way over priced.   Place still looks just like aTGI Fridays but they moved the bar. I think their money could've been better spent elsewhere. The outside patio looks nice but it's called \"The Spin Zone\". Why? There is nothing about the patio that would make you decide to call it that name.   The only thing that was good was the Ranger IPA they had on draft. It was icy cold and tasted great so I ordered a second one only to be told they were out.   Good luck Prairie Fire but I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try a new place so he made reservations for 12 family members and friends.  What a Huge Disappointment!!!  Poor Service and Poor food for the price.  My sister in law did not even get her entr√©e.  We will never go back and a don't think anyone who was with us will either.  They need to get it together!!!  We were there 1/11/13."}
{"text":"Took friends for dinner. 3 ordered steak. None were happy. Ordered a bottle of Merlot and asked server for recommendation. She said \"this is the cheapest\".  Not good. Brought the bottle to table and didn't know how to open bottle. I was happy with smoked salmon w/o glaze. Disappointed in presentation, server and steaks. No one ate more than 1/3 of steak."}
{"text":"On a whim, five coworkers and I decided to try Prairie Fire for lunch.  There is nothing terrible about this restaurant, but it's major downfall is the average food for above average prices.    The service was ok, the food was too salty, the menu was boring, and the restaurant didn't have an angle.  It was similar to what you would find at TGI Friday's, Ruby Tuesday's, or Applebees but more expensive with, dare I say, less tasty food. The redeeming fact is that Prairie Fire is not a chain, but not enough to make me ever want to go to the restaurant again.  Ideas for Prairie Fire: lower prices or higher food quality, consider a lunch menu, provide the community something they can't get anywhere else (in a good way), dinner entree specials, drink specials, happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food, superb service, awesome atmosphere! Not to mention the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so I thought I'd give the black bean burger a try. Generally speaking, I am disappointed by vegetarian meals at American-style restaurants--always seems like these dishes are an afterthought. I can honestly say that this was the best black bean burger I've ever had. It was juicy, had the right amount of flavor, fresh toppings--so delicious!  In addition to a fantastic meal, the waitstaff were friendly, and the outdoor patio was lovely on a summer afternoon. I would highly recommend Prairie Fire!"}
{"text":"We have been back twice since my first review and I really like the service and the food here.  I had the New York Strip steak with loaded mashed potatoes and a salad.  The salad was fresh with house-made dressing.  The mashed potatoes were fantastic and the steak was very tasty.  My husband had the steak fajitas.  They came with chips and salsa and the salsa was awesome.  It is not an endless bowl and that is a shame because I could have eaten way more of the salsa.  I am really looking forward to Spring so we can go and sit on the patio and have a couple of beverages with some of that awesome salsa.  My daughter had the kids meal macaroni & cheese.  It was really good.  Fresh and creamy and NOT the Kraft blue box mac and cheese.  This is the real stuff and it is really good.  The manager came by our table and gave us a gift certificate for 1/2 the cost of meal for our next visit.  It was for bringing the family in.  That was a very pleasant surprise and we will certainly take our family back."}
{"text":"Buca was booked solid all night due to Mom's weekend. My wife & daughter had been here before so we headed down. As much as I'd like the Q I got the angus beef burger. I thought it was pretty good, juicy & flavorful. My wife really liked the shrimp. The server said they bread it to order. Our daughter, who can be pretty picky, finished almost all of her pulled pork. The price point was more than I was looking for but I thought it was ok for the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"I wife and I went here and we both ordered a sandwich. I don't remember what sandwich I got it was unremarkable and we got the salad bar. here's the thing you need to know about the salad bar wilted lettuce. The waitress we had told us the shortcomings of another waitress. She also told us that the owner comes up with the menu items. He should higher a Chef because the food is mediocre. It wasn't fast it wasn't great find somewhere else to go. Too many options in this town to waste your money there."}
{"text":"Staff friendly and focused on service. Great pricing for lunch. Can easily get in and out when you are short on time. The expanded lunch buffet is a great addition."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, 5 stars, service 5 stars, food 4 stars.I would have given food 5 stars, but my steak was not as hot as I would have liked. The salad bar was outstanding. Located in the old TGIF building, but they have made it look more classy."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty reasonably priced food, and conveniently located.  Plenty of seating inside and out.  A comfortable and relaxing atmosphere--a refreshing change from the TGI Chili's chains.  Plan to go back soon--"}
{"text":"Wow!! What a magnificent difference.  I went to Prairie Fire Restaurant again this past Sunday and  oh my goodness, the food was awesome.  Everything and I mean everything from the host, to the waiter to the food to management were outstanding.  I again had the Broasted Chicken and it was delicious.  Hot with a light crispy coating and the inside juicy and the favor was wonderful.  The management, Mike and Holly, were friendly, gracious and accommodating.  It was a magnificent experience.  This, once again, has  become my favorite restaurant in town.  Thanks Mike for making things right, it showed me you care.  See you soon, I will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! the food is always good and the service is even better the staff are always very friendly. The addition of the hot salad bar was a good choice. I would recommend trying the Prime Rib, or the Beef Stroganoff! This is very kid friendly or a good place to go just for the bar."}
{"text":"Waiter has no voice left and is still the nicest waiter ever. Derek. Nice atmosphere. Pricey for sure."}
{"text":"Just tried the Prairie Fire restaurant this evening! I went thinking that it would be TGI. Prairie Fire occupies the same space where TGI Friday's used to be.  Since I was already there, I took a quick peak at the menu before deciding to sit down. Compared to TGI, the number of menu items is very limited! It seemed decent enough, and so a friend and I decided to give it a whirl!  I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla as an appetizer. Pretty average; nothing really to rave about. But, I figured that you couldn't get too fancy with a quesadilla.  For the main course, I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my friend ordered the Southwest Chicken Cajun Pasta. The bed of rice with the Teriyaki Chicken was okay, but what was supposed to be Teriyaki Chicken was grilled chicken sans teriyaki sauce. Not even the smallest hint of Teriyaki! When I requested a side of teriyaki sauce, apparently they didn't have any and only used a marinade(?) Anyway, I was not at all pleased with the Teriyaki Chicken. I would give it a 0/5 stars.  My friend ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta. This was also nothing to rave about. I can make better at home.   Food-wise, it was a pretty lackluster experience. Not worth the $45. Prices didn't really make up for the lack of quality either.  The one star is for the fairly decent service."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Went here for dinner one evening. It was mostly empty as it was a Monday night.   The service was very good. The wait staff were attentive and were very pleasant to interact with.  The food was A-ok. The menu was a mix of Steak, American, Mexican and Italian dishes. The onion rings were good but a bit on the greasy side. There is a salad bar, but we did not make use of it. Standard salad bar items. The fajitas were ok but I can tell the rest of the stuff on it (guac, salsa etc) were right out of a can. Bacon wrapped shrimp was good, but a bit burnt.   The drink was a disappointment. The beer I got was very flat and did not feel fresh and crispy.   The booths are a tad bit tight. I wonder why they designed it so. There is patio seating, should be pleasant when weather permits. There are several TVs for sports.  A good place to go with friends and enjoy a couple of drinks and finger food.  The prices are attractive. They have very attractive daily specials. I highly recommend checking those out.  Will go back and hope to get a better drink."}
{"text":"My boyfriend chose this place because of the burning gateway.  Lol  We had the ribs and steak.  Both were very flavorful and cooked perfectly, according to our specifications.  The bbq sauce that came with the ribs were very tasty.  My steak was just a bit chewy, but it was nicely marinated.    The sides offered were really good.  I had the house salad and he had a Caesar.  We also had the loaded baked potatoes.    They also offer some pretty tasty cocktails."}
