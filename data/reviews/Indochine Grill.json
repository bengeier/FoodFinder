{"text":"Went to dinner at Indochine Grill on 26 Jun 09.  The food was ok but not worth the price.  The reason I gave this place 2 stars was because the service was terrible.  We walked in and there was no host/hostess for like 5 minutes to take our name down for a table.  After waiting for about 30 minutes, we got a table.  However, we did not get service for 20 minutes.  We flagged down the hostess who ended up being our waitress as well as the busgirl for other tables.  We ordered two appetizers but when our food came out, only one came.  They said they ran out of the other one 30 minutes prior but the table accross from us received that same appetizer as we were receiving our food.  They said they would comp our appetizer but when we received our bill, they not only charged us for the two appetizers we ordered (and which we only received one) they charged us for an additional appetizer.  In closing, I DO NOT recommend this place unless you want to pay a lot of money for mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.   Modern, asian-themed decor inside EpiCentre. We were seated immediately, not a big lunchtime crowd (it's a bit pricier than other EpiCentre places like Jason's Deli, 5 guys, etc.)   Started with grape-leave wrapped beef with dipping sauce. Very good - strong flavors but essentially comfort food. Had the Vietnamese salad with noodles and beef, excellent dish with a great fish-sauce dressing. My friend had a Vietnamese soup with noodles, also very good and filling.   Overall a good addition to the Uptown dining scene and a nice alternative to the chains. However, I think it is a bit pricey as an every day lunch place."}
{"text":"We got there pretty late.  We took a docent-led tour beforehand and were told that the EpiCentre would probably be the best place to go because there are so many to choose from!  In the end, we chose Indochine because who doesn't love tapas?  We pretty much ordered everything from the menu.  I liked the Crab Rangoons the best simply because I love them in general.  Their drink specials were pretty awesome though - ranging from $3-$10.  They were made well too.  Love to drink but don't necessarily want to taste the alcohol.  Haha!  Servers could have been better - they actually switched out between service without telling us."}
