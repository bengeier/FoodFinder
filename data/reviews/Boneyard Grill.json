{"text":"Excellent food!  Great service!  Fantastic portions! Fair prices!  We will be back for another casual meal!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and decided to try this place. When we entered the staff were busy with takeouts and no one was around to greet or seat us. so we were waiting there when the waitress almost screamed at us that we can't just walk-in because the tables are reserved !!! She was extremely rude and we were so shocked by her attitude that did not say anything and just left there. I will never go to this place again as there are many other options in the neighborhood with excellent and polite service."}
{"text":"I went in expecting a decent BBQ but was happily surprised when the food came. I shared the onion brick which is a must try if you have a group. For my main I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was CRAZY GOOD! The meat was so moist and the bbq sauce was right on. I would suggest adding their chipotle mayo on for even more taste. The best part is it's well priced for what you get. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"I was here about 16, 8 and 4 months ago. After my first visit, I would have awarded 5 stars for excellent pork ribs and sides. However, shortly after that visit, quality seems to have declined. The next two times I tried the ribs they were not even remotely in the same quality/flavour ballpark as originally. Drier, tougher, weak flavour. Others seemed to notice this as well.

The fries have always been good, the burger is decent, beef ribs are decent, but I really got screwed out of what I was hoping was going to be my new favorite rib joint."}
{"text":"So we discovered this little jem by accitent and let me tell you, it was well worth it!
First of all the service is very friendly and polite, the server was extremely knowledgeable and knew exactly what she was doing.
The atmosphere is calm and very casual, this is not a big place but definitely cozy and clean. As far as service and atmosphere - Excellent!
Now to the food:
First of all, it is absolutely delicious! not a very expensive place, however the food is all home made and tastes better than restaurants that cost ten times more.
We ordered the soup of the day (Cabbage Borscht) which was made with beef (vegetarians please note there is beef in there) and it was delicious! I am Russian and this tasted just like grandma used to make, absolutely delicious!
Also the Burger - oh my God this burger is grilled to perfection just the way we ordered it and made in-house not frozen stuff this is the real deal.
The BBQ sauce is also amazing highly recommend it - we took a bottle home, in hopes to attempt to BBQ a similar tasting burger (no chance; we'll just go back to the Boneyard!) so this is an excellent local jem, if you're ever around I highly recommend you check it out - well worth it!

I give this place an 11 out of 10! 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is good the service staff is great!!!  The one thing I would complain about and think is STUPID is they won't let you order double sides!  WTH really?????"}
{"text":"North of the US this BBQ place is quite good! I love the beef ribs (although you'll need to floss right after) and the fall-off-the-ribs pork ribs. The fries are great and I loved the dipping sauce. I didn't care for the onion sticks. The next time I order the meat water combo Ill just get the 2 orders of fries as opposed to fries and onion sticks.
Go on a Tuesday when they have a special for a rack of back ribs for $22.  Now that I'm writing this, I think I'm going tomorrow for the special. Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Came here for my grand father 94th birthday and sent 50% of the food back.

Our kids fries where cold. 2 french onion soups had to go back. Salmon meal went back it was over done. Steak was extremely thin and overdone. Ribs both beef and pork where cold.

The only thing that was good was the wine, but they didn't make it.

The wan serving the restaurant was a star.the owner is absent and should maybe reconsider being in the meat business since I understand he is a bagel guy.

I am in the meat business and South African.

This place is disappointing.

Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went on Thursday, which has discounted Ribs (Half-rack for 16, and Full-rack for 22). Now I'm a big meat eater so I can tell you right now that for most of us that like to tear through ribs and wings, one rack is barely enough to satisfy. It really needs to be bigger. There is an entire potato of fries, so you'll probably be full. The flavour is very good, a complex sauce with a bit of kick that I couldn't place, and it's finished against open flames. Much better than crap you get from the mid-range chains like Montana's.

The place is a bit small - 30 seats - with sidewalk seating. On a weeknight, they were understandably understaffed. I guess they don't expect many people so one waitress is enough. This isn't my local neighbourhood so I won't come out here specifically for the ribs, the value proposition isn't good enough even on Thursdays. However, if I were closer, I could see popping by for a game night with some friends."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Boneyard Grill for some takeout.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich that came with a fair sized coleslaw and a choice of side.  I ordered the baked potato which was quite large and tasted nicely baked and less steamed.  This meal was only $11.95 before taxes and portions were very generous.  They used a large egg bun and the pulled pork looked lean was piled very high with some fried onions.  The sauce was a little sweeter than I like.  The owner had a great accent (I'm guessing South African) and the waitresses were pretty nice.  I've returned for their chicken dinner takeout and just a takeout of the slaw and baked potatoes.  The service was very good and efficient.  I like that they use paper bags with handles too.  Overall, a tasty experience."}
{"text":"to sum it up - overly salted to compensate for lack of flavour, disgustingly greasy, go home and feel sick from eating **it food

we got the onion brick, the boneyard burger and the bbq burger

the onion brick is like eating a brick of salt and oil... nasty

the boneyard burger---- undercooked burger. i like my steaks medium but my burgers well done. nasty nasty nasty

the bbq burger - again undercooked 

both burgers buns werent toasted or warm. isnt that common sense? its like having cereal with no milk

we both went home feeling sick to our stomach from eating **it food"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday. Very few restaurants open on Sunday in this area for some reason. We were the only people in the place (maybe thats why). So the only issue was lack of atmosphere......other than that it was very good. The value is incredible. The portions are large and the prices more than reasonable. 2 of us had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and the other 2 had the clubhouse. Tasted great and the server was very freindy and efficient. They do take out too."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x and both times it was fantastic. The ribs are delicious and are different from the typical bar/pub kind. 

I've also taken my toddler and he's happy with the food. Ambiance is nice. It was classier/trendier than what I expected from the outside appearance."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing. One of my favorite places to eat at. Really busy tonight. Obviously others agree."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the worst in Toronto. I ordered food tonight and they got my order completely wrong. When I called and told them they offered to send the meal again. After an hour they assured me that the driver was on the way. 40 minutes later we called and the staff could not provide an answer and apparently could not contact the delivery person. They were not going to try to even contact the person until we asked them to. After paying $50 for chicken fingers and burger, the chicken fingers were slop and 3 hours later, still no burger or any staff who seems to understand why this would be upsetting. Do not order from or eat here. Robbery."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, the burgers, steaks and beef ribs are all excellent. Had a slight issue with the doneness on my steak one day and the chef immediately came out to apologize to me and make sure that I was taken care of."}
{"text":"Very cozy atmosphere, not too big and good lighting. Couple of TVs. Friendly staff, quick service. Food came in a very reasonable time.  Portions are quite sizable. Not an overwhelming menu but enough choice and \"classics\" to offer enough variety. 
Had the family, 3 adults, and teen and a 10 yr old and everybody was happy. No complaints. Would definitely eat there again.
Oh yeah, one complaint; no gravy! Wt...."}
{"text":"Amazing food & service!  I went with a large group last night and we all ordered different things.  We all loved the food.  I highly recommend the pork back ribs....delicious & meaty.  The coconut shrimp was exceptional."}
{"text":"Very nice burger. Sweet potato fries were excellent.. Shoestring fries left something to be desired, however... In my opinion, plates need to be bigger( fries and stuff were falling off my burger plate !) also burger bun not all that great... Ribs and rib sauce were highly recommended and highly enjoyed by others. Loved the cheesecake factory desserts- although dissapointed they had run out of the plain NY style cake!
Oh well!
LOVE Avenue road locaiton too ! awesome for picking up for a night  in !"}
{"text":"It used to be a great place for supper, a mixed drink and an appetizer. My wife and I both considered it our favorite,however it is under new ownership and seems to be headed in the wrong direction. We recently had a horrible experience there and don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Had a ribeye sandwich that was wonderful but fries were burnt. 

Service was horrible. Our waitress reached over the table each time, leaning on us and making us stretch across the table to get our food and drinks.  She had to be retrieved every time we needed her, she never checked back on us. After an hour of this, they went to get the bill and she said she would get them to us. 15 minutes later we finally got them. They were not very busy and were well staffed, so not sure what the deal was."}
{"text":"This place is great, staff was very friendly.  Food was good, I most enjoyed the ribs and the onion brick.  Burger was really good as well, think it was a homemade patty and not a frozen patty. Surprisingly even the wings were good.  Now if you knew me you would know that I like my food so for me to say this place has good food then it's a must try."}
{"text":"Funny how I live around the corner but never came in until I had a craving for ribs and knew I didn't want to go out of my way. Certainly glad I finally gave Boneyard a try. Me and my guest decided to split a burger and the Meat Lovers 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and wings, along with the coconut shrimp app. All were amazing! The ribs were fall-off- the-bone delicious, as were the wings. Ordered the burger medium-well, only because other reviewers said their medium burgers were too rare, and it was done to perfection.  Only a little disappointed at the size of the burger itself as in all the other reviewers pics, the burger was much larger than what was served. The sides of onion straws and fries were also delicious and plentiful. Only thing I would change is that both dipping sauces for the coconut shrimp are sweet, and my recommendation would be to have a spicy choice. Server was prompt and very friendly, coming by a few times to make sure everything was good and that we were happy with what we ordered.
All in all, a great new discovery right in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Just perfect for meat and bbq lovers was impressed with the philly sandwich and the back ribs!"}
{"text":"We shared the combo for two and got beef and pork ribs. Flavour was sooo good and the portion sizes were great."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food at this place, the coconut shrimps are the best that I ever try, onion brick is a really different appetizer, the ribs and the New York steak were good. Also, the staff is really friendly. I really enjoyed my dinner there."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Things were bad the moment we walked in. There was only one waitress working. Given the shitty weather we decided to stay. Apparently her coworker had a car accident so she was stuck working alone. The owner of the restaurant should have came and worked or had another staff member come in. We could see she was stressed so tried not to bother her much. It took a bit longer for food as there were a lot of delivery orders. The food was sub par. The chicken I had tasted disgusting. Like it wasn't fresh. May have been left overs from another day. Should have sent it back but didn't want to wait for a replacement. What was the real zinger was when the bill arrived. The waitress had the audacity to tack on an 18% tip on the credit card machine. NOT the bill but just added it onto the machine before handing it over. We were not a large party and your service was not great. While it wasn't entirely her fault. You can't just assume. I understand some restaurants will tack on a tip if you're a big party. Tip is not mandatory. If your service doesn't warrant a tip, you can't just sneak it onto the credit card machine. Never returning to this restaurant. Ever."}
{"text":"Boneyard Grill is famous for its ribs. It had different kinds of combos in the menu with burgers, ribs, and chicken etc. It also serves alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to go with your meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful and friendly staff! The food was amazing! I had the pulled pork with sweet potatoes. My husband had the ribs. Ribs were cooked to perfection... They were so tender, juicy and flavourful. The pulled pork was busting with flavor as well. Portions are big.  Sweet potato fries were perfection. . So crispy and thinly sliced. I will definitely be back for more. They do have a kids menu."}
{"text":"Since I am a new \"yelper\", and many of you do not quite know me yet, I have to make two things very clear....

Beef and Beer.

That's pretty much what it takes to make this girl smile.  And smile I did, after I had my first Boneyard burger experience this past Saturday. 

This weekend my sister and brother-in-law were visiting from North Bay and after a 4 hour drive they were getting hungry.  And let's face it, North Bay has slim pickins' when it comes to \"non-restaurant chain\" choices. So, naturally, I searched YELP for hamburger places and landed on \"Boneyard Grill\".  Why not? I ate like a rabbit all week, i'll treat myself!

The place was super easy to find and had lots of parking. Covered with a small awning,  it is quaint and has lots of character.  Inside they had TVs showing sports, of course, what else do you watch while eating a burger!? Perfect!
The staff are super friendly, sat us right away and were quick to bring the first round of beer!  

For my meal, I chose the mushroom and swiss burger with a side of half an half fries! Brilliant idea. You get the best of both worlds, half  yam and half regular fries...I found my inner monologue screaming \" WHY DOESN'T EVERY PLACE OFFER THIS??\"

When the burgers came we all dug in and for the first time ever we were all speechless. Not a word was spoken. Coming from a family of outrageously loud English people, this is strange.  

The burgers were cooked perfectly, medium well, just as I like it. Tender and juicy but did not fall apart. The fries were shoe string style, perfect for yam fries (as they cook better) and served with a side of homemade chipotle mayo.  Need I say more?

Speaking of more... I'm drooling again. 

Take the time to try this place out whether its with your buddies, family or even a date. Yes, it has great date potential. And yes, you can take a girl on a date to a burger place...well, this girl anyway!

Hot tip: If you go Saturdays their special is a sirloin burger for 9.99 with fries!  It's pretty much the same price as a \"chain\" burger joint!  

Let me know what you think!

Cheers, 
Tiff"}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple of times now and still think it's ok. I'd prefer Stack on Yonge if I'm looking for BBQ meat around the area.  It can hit the spot if you have the craving but won't blow your socks off."}
{"text":"Finally! Finally, finally FINALLY! I get to try this place. It's only been open for how long? It's been on my bookmark list for ages and yesterday I finally got to eat here. 

Now I was a touch on the broke side so I couldn't afford to go in guns blazing and order up \"racks on racks on racks\" of Ribs (shout out to Drake), so I did the next best thing and stuck with my go to lunch choice - Burgers!

Specifically, I went with the Melting Cheddar Cheese and Housemade Smokin' Bacon burger. Deadly. Not just because they toss tons of cheddar and housemade bacon on top, but because the standard size of their burgers is a whopping 10oz! Jeez!

I loved the taste of this burger AND even more I loved that they allowed me to choose how I wanted my burger cooked. This is something I am rarely asked here in GTA, but I know it's common place in the USA. I went with the most option - Medium, which was cooked to a pink/red center.

The fries on the side were pretty cool - picture the shoestring size of McDonalds fries... only more.... skinny. The cutest looking fries (yes I'm referring to my fries as cute) I've ever seen! PLUS you get a wack load of them. Score!

This is a 4 not a 5 as I've yet to explore the menu in greater detail (salads, ribs, steaks, etc) so I'd like to start them off with a 4 and see if the other items don't push them right over the top for me!

Looking forward to my next visit (soon)!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Madison and my first time at the Grill. I ordered a grilled fish sandwich, blackened per the server's recommendation. It was wonderful! I will definitely look them up again the next time I find myself in Madison."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress talked on the phone  loudly and barely attended to our table. The wait was considerable even though there were only two tables seated during my visit. She then rushed and almost hit me in the face with the plate.The burgers here are so greasy that your bun will come soaked and falling apart before you get halfway through. The shoe string fries are tasteless and dry. You get a hearty serving but unless you feel like eating half a bottle of ketchup with them you'll probably leave them. 
Price is fair but they need to train their staff better and have a bit more pride in their product and service this has the potential to be a great spot."}
{"text":"Tried this place while passing through town. The food was very good. Ribeye was cooked to perfection. The stuffed mushrooms are very good. The lower marks are for service. The waitress was more interested in changing channels on TV. We had to ask for silverware. Twice. Other then service, food was great. Let me also note that the place was not busy at the time."}
{"text":"Probably the best Burger I have had in the GTA, which was very surprising. I strongly recommend this place, and don't let the \"first impression\" turn you off. The food is a lot more authentic than the very unauthentic decor."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the burger here is amazing! Came by for the Yelp Burger during the Burger Binge Week, and was absolutely blown away! 

Came in during a rather quiet time, so we sat down immediately and got our food quite fast! We got the Yelp Burger, so the orders were very simple! The burger was so good, with the patty cooked to medium and each topping adding more depth to the burger as you bite into it, especially those onions! With different textures and flavours, this is definitely a burger worth travelling for!

We got to speak to the owner as well, and he explained how he came up with the Yelp Burger! Absolutely a delight to meet the man, and see all the heart he puts into his menu!

Service was a bit slow with our waters, as we asked for them when we sat, but didn't get them until our food arrived. Not a big deal though as the server was super nice and friendly, and even gave us $5 coupons as it was our first time to the restaurant!

Definitely enjoyed the burger, and will be back to try some other items off their menu! Supposed to be some of the BBQ around, so gonna be back for some of that!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 Philly Cheesesteaks for takeout and waited over 45 min only to get the wrong order - two New York Steak sandwiches. Person who took my order charged me for the wrong items and did not refund me upon request. I waited longer for them to get my order right, but they messed up again! I arrived home and noticed the chef sliced up the meat from the New York steak sandwich and put it into a sandwich with cheese, passing it off as a Philly Cheesesteak. I am disgusted by the service provided and the way that I was treated. DO not eat here. Notice the chunks of fat and the grill marks on the meat. Obviously not a Philly Cheesesteak. Get it right Boneyard!!! I had to return to the restaurant hours later to fight for my money back."}
{"text":"I stopped in at the Boneyard Grill for an early supper. The waitress was very friendly and prompt in responding to my questions. I started with the coconut shrimp, which were very good. I especially liked the mango dipping sauce. The Philly Steak bun was quite tasty, with peppers, sautéed onions and their special BBQ sauce, which was a nice spicy-sweet. I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place during Yelp's Burger Binge and it did not disappoint.  It was really busy for a Thursday night.  A little bit of a wait to be seated and lots of people getting take out. A crowd is usually a good sign. 

The Yelp Burger was a 5 oz Burger with bacon, cheese and onion straws!  The waitress said it was a smaller version of their cowboy Burger and said it was the size of a slider.  So the hubs and I ordered one each and decided to share a full rack rib dinner.  We came in on a Thursday night which happened to be rib night!  $20 for succulent full rack of ribs with a side. It was delicious!  

Now back to the Burger...the Burger was juicy and the onion straws gave it the perfect crunch! And you can't go wrong with bacon and cheese.  Plus, it looked like a regular sized Burger to me, not a slider.  That was another pleasant surprise.  Love good sized portions!  There were 2 big guys sitting next to us that ordered the Yelp Burger each and a rack or ribs each.  They made the same comment, this was a really big slider! 

Will be back to eat the cowboy Burger and ribs again for sure!  Saw other people eating wings which looked really good too.  Thanks Yelp Burger Binge for getting us out to try this place!"}
{"text":"Boneyard Grill is exactly that... A-OK.
For a quick, easy dinner choice, Boneyard is probably a solid bet.  However, I didn't find their burgers to be out of this world like some other joints I've checked out recently (Holy Chuck, Burger's Priest etc.).

In their defense, I ordered the veggie burger wrapped in lettuce... Probably not a number 1 choice when scoping out a real burger restaurant, but I had high expectations that were simply not met... even for a veggie burger.

I may decide to check this place out again and go for the real deal (a real juicy burger).. But for now, I'm still on the fence."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon. Not busy at all. It took about 15 min for the guy to come give us our drinks. It took another 10 min after that to get menus and we had to ask for them. After he took our order we waited for 30 minutes, no food. Keep in mind the place had 10 people on there tops and 8 people were drinking beer. After inquiring why it takes so long to cook two burgers the manager stated \" we forgot to make the order\". I left immediately. Will not be back. This town doesn't have too many places to choose from so I can't understand the subpar service."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand how this place had 80% of the tables full and a steady stream of takeout customers. My guess is that the surrounding condominiums support this local eatery because of sheer convenience.

That said the burgers looked good in the picture and I suppose we should've ordered that but we came for bbq. The baby back ribs were quite delicious BUT that is IT !

The wings tasted like the freezer; and the coleslaw and wilted greens were gross.

We ordered a Greek salad and it left much to be desired; olive oil for one.

The waitress (the one who looks like Elvira) wasn't knowledgable of the food and she was overworked. Try asking her what dressing is on the Greek salad; you will have a great laugh. 

Memphis barbeque in Woodbridge is a much better choice - go there. Further out but you won't be disappointed. We were.

FYI - I still tipped her $25 on a $130 bill. I'm not a jerk."}
{"text":"Great burger with heaps of toppings. the meat had flavour and also the staff was friendly.

Also ordered the ribs, it was medium sized served with lots and lots of fries. Very good BBQ flavour used in the sauce. I went in on weekday lunch special and found the prices were much lower then their dinner price. Which was a good thing.

Pretty reasonably priced for a gourmet burger joint, Most likely going to be back as I definitely wasn't disappointed. P.S there is a bar styled table at the front of the restaurant which has open windows. Nice to get some sun and drink a cold one while on lunch"}
{"text":"This was our first and last trip to this resturant.
We arrived around 500pm and the resturant was empty.  No one in the resturant and the waitress was laying on the bench sleeping.  She did pop up pretty fast once she saw us.
Ordered an appetizer which was good.  My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fries and I got the Juicy Lucy burger.  Our waitress was prompt and she did her job well.
The Pulled Pork sandwich was so dry with no sauce.  He did take a few bites and couldn't eat the rest.  Waitress came over and asked if everything was ok. He explained that the Pulled Pork was as dry as sandpaper.  She left and the owner told us he wouldn't be charging us for his sandwich. She offered him something else to eat or dessert.  
 Which was great.  But at this point we both just wanted to leave.
My hamburger was amazing but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered from Ubereats. Delivery came within the estimated time. No problems. What I do have a problem with are the extravagant prices. I compared Ubereats with their regular menu and indeed Uber makes it a little more expensive even before the delivery fee. So if you don't live too far, I suggest you consider visiting the store instead. but I find that even on the regular menu, prices are steep.

Onto the food itself. We ordered a full rack of ribs, with shoe string fries, and my brother ordered a combo for 1 with onion straws. The ribs are around $30 + tax (with fries) which is kind of ridiculous. I've had very nice ribs at rib fest for $24 (no fries)tax included. And many restaurants do ribs for under $25 with a side (+ tax and tips). The ribs were good but I don't feel it justifies the price. It's more or less the same good ribs you can get elsewhere. 

The combo for 1 was even less worthwhile. Combo for 1 is choose 2 meats and a side. We had miami ribs and sausages. We didn't know what Miami ribs meant. Apparently it's like Korean Kalbi.   I don't really find the sausages too special. The onion straws are pretty good, but hey, deep fried anything is good. 

I love southern BBQ but there's no way I would come again at these prices. It's not special enough to justify charging 20-30% more than other similar places."}
{"text":"We got the combo plate,  both pork and beef ribs.  Beef Ribs are a must.  I'm a dry rub type of guy,  but the sauce was actually pretty tasty.  U recommend the onion brick too"}
{"text":"Portions here are huge and the food has always been delicious every time I've visited. Have tried the wings, pulled pork and brisket sandwiches in the past. Just the right amount of sauce and generous heaps of meat.

The lunch specials are the best value and I found the pulled pork sandwich to be just as big as the dinner version with a free can of pop included.

My favourite side to order are the seasoned vegetables to help balance all that meat.  Whatever seasoning they put on those, it's delicious and far from the bland veggies you get at other places. 

Service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Craving some BBQ food and more? The best place to go to hands down! Their food is just amazing and there is such a variety of options not just burgers. When i went for the first time a couple months ago, their service was so excellent that it made us feel very comfortable with the staff. I definitely recommend this place to everyone, you'll love their food just as much as i do and you'll even keep going back as well:)!"}
{"text":"I had the burger and the French onion soup. It was the best food I have ever eaten. The food also looks like it does on commercials!!"}
{"text":"We came here during burger binge week and ordered the Giddy up Yelp burger. A 5 oz Classic burger topped with cheddar cheese, BBQ chipotle, lettuce, tomato, pickles, bacon and stacked onion straws (picture below).

This is the best Yelp burger I had so far! Patty was dripping juices. Sauce is so tasty that you wont need to add ketchup on your bun. Plenty of tasty onion straws. All this for $5!

Service was great and friendly even though we came during closing time. Free WiFi. I will surely come back here and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Went here on a pretty busy Saturday night. It's right by Promenade Mall in Thornhill. Honestly, the food selection around there is weak. Decided to check this place out based on Yelp reviews, and it was just an alright experience.
- Food took too long to come out (20-25 min), all we ordered were burgers
- Fries were too skinny for my liking
- I had the Boneyard burger (sautéed mushrooms and onions) and it was just what you'd expect. The burger tasted fine, but wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

Which sums up my review. If you want something plain and straightforward, come here. And hey, sometimes there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"It's the closest barbecue to me, otherwise I'd be at Stockyard.  Tried the Really Wicked burger with pulled pork and fried egg.  Close but no cigar."}
{"text":"It's too average and a bit too expensive for what you get. The staff was courteous and helpful. They made a mistake on a burger and corrected it quickly. The hospitality is what I liked the most in this place. 

The burger and grilled cheese sandwich were dry and latter is as a bit too sickly from what I perceived was too much butter. The Philly cheese steak on a bun had way too much barbecue sauce. The beef ribs could have been a little more tender, but were enjoyable, the fries were tasty and the chicken wings with honey garlic sauce had a good balance of flavored, although I think they burnt something in the kitchen, because there was a strong smell when it was served. 

If you are in a hurry or are craving for a barbecue joint in a pinch, this will do, but if you can drive 10-15 minutes from there, Memphis will blow your brains out for half the price."}
{"text":"My buddies and I wanted to have a major meat session and we came across this place on Yelp and we decided to check it out. I walked in and this place was busy for a long weekend, which is a good sign. We had a reservation and the staff said to give them a few minutes to setup. And in a few minutes, we were led to our table. 

Onto the food. We began to flip through the menu and saw their ribs section, but I wasn't feeling it (even though we came to a place known for that). I ordered the Cowboy burger with onion straws. Two of my friends ordered the ribs combo and my other buddy ordered the steak sandwich. Our food came about 20 mins later. First impression... all the plates are HUGE and so are the portion sizes. My burger was good, stacked with bacon and cheese *drool*. However the star to me is the in house BBQ sauce, that was pretty tasty. I have only one comment and that is the onion straws. I would imagine it being not oily, or my expectations were similar to onion rings. When fried, suppose to be drained of the oil. Just an observation I had and that would explain why I didn't finish the onion straws.

The staff are attentive and polite. May come back when I am feeling it for the ribs. Overall experience is just alright... Not wow-ing."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Delicious! Ribs were amazing and so was the pulled pork sandwich. Ubereats delivered which was pretty cool"}
{"text":"We went for a guys night out and decides to settle on this place because it was rated pretty high around the area (that wasn't Asian food). 

Upon coming in from a dark rainy late afternoon. We were greeted with a warm welcoming smile from the hostess who just happen to also be our waitress as well. The staff was friendly from begin to end. Service was fast and always attentive. Our glass was never empty! 

We got some ribs, chicken, wings and beef ribs. And boy were we glad we did. The home made sauce was amazing. 

They also came along with some sides as well. My favorite was the mixes fries. Nice helping of regular fries and sweet potato fries. The unique thing about them was that they're skinny yet just the right degree of crunchiness. Not over cooked and brittle. 

Definitely a good place to go if you're craving some ribs. Puts ribfest ribs to shame!"}
{"text":"I ordered the boneyard burger and it was ok but nothing was good. The meat was fine, the mushroom and onions were ok but really didn't have much flavour. What was weird was that the burger had no lettuce or tomato - since when do you order a burger and not get lettuce (even on the side). With nothing to cut into the grease the burger just felt a little mushy - not good. The fries are shoestring as others report but also are nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  I use to come here regularly for the variety of beer offerings and food options.  They had great wings and pizza at decent prices.  They even had a mug club. 

Sadly, no more.  The mug club is gone.  Tap selections are lackluster.  The food prices have increased and the portion size has decreased.  

I have come here for lunch and the service is more misses that hits.  No more 15 minute lunch guarantee.  

They added lasagna, which was good the first 2 times, but very dry the last time.  You get a side with the lasagna, but cannot choose breadsticks as a side - we were told the reason is you already get a breadstick with the lasagna.  Seriously!?  Yes, they were.  

My last visit they ran out of the liquor I choose to drink (a regular bourbon most places stock) after serving my first drink- not a good sign.  

The wings have completely changed.  They were by the pound and grilled with a nice char to them.  Now they are by the count - I paid $13.99 for 12- they were the smallest, most undercooked wings I have ever received at a restaurant.  I sent them back to be grilled more and they were not much better.  I took them home and grilled them myself.

 A bright spot is they do use fresh greens on their salads.  

Overall, the Boneyard is not a dining spot we would choose to spend our time and money."}
{"text":"The Boneyard Grill was, is and hopefully will be my favourite neighbourhood spot, whether it's for picking up a takeout order for a quick bite, or sitting down for a normal meal. 

I've been there dozens of times, and I can never get enough of their Louisiana sauce :)

Will repeat, many times."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here tonight with my boyfriend. We both ordered burgers for dinner. They were okay. Sort of dry and flavourless. Service was good."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night in December and it was fantastic!  Everyone at our table of 6 enjoyed their meal!  I ordered the pulled pork which was out of this world!  The portions are epic and you will not be disappointed.  

I noticed there was a review here from someone who was sick by the amount of grease in their meal.  My response to that is: if you are worried about greasy food or counting calories, you should not be ordering a burger and fries.  They have plenty of healthier options on the menu - you should have ordered a salad.  If you suffer from heart burn, come prepared and bring your pepto!  If you like your burger well done - tell the server and they will happily cook it more for you."}
{"text":"Came here last year for a Yelp event and finally made it back for Round 2!  

Service: 4/5.  We were checked on a few times, staff was friendly and accommodating of our lack of speed in deciding on our orders.  No problems.

Food: 4/5. In contrast to the Yelp event, this time we got full meals - tried the fried onion strings - very tasty, though also very greasy.  Probably hard to avoid with this kind of preparation but in the future I'd opt for the shoestring sweet potato fries, which were plentiful and came with an interesting [in a good way] mayo sauce that's slightly different from the usual sweet potato sauce you get elsewhere.  The BBQ chicken and ribs were good - at least on par with most quality BBQ establishments.  The coleslaw was small and overly vinegary - maybe more creaminess might've been nice.  Of course, nothing ever beats KFC coleslaw (am I right?)

So overall, great meal - nothing really to complain about, though not really blown away (which I need to be for a 5 star rating).  If the coleslaw were bigger & better, and the onion strings weren't as greasy, I might've rounded up - but I can't do it this time around.  

I would definitely recommend though if you're in the area and are in the mood for some BBQ!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place about a year ago and has been my favorite ever since. I really enjoy their appetizers they are inline any you find at other  places. Great stuffed mushrooms, bacon jalapeños, and cheese sticks. I also really enjoy their Reuben and steaks! By far my favorite thing about this place is the \"Beer Club\" it's where you drink 43 different kinds of beer and at the end are awarded with your own mug with your name on it. HUGE variety of beer, actually got me into drinking craft beers! Always had great service here too. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Coming here on a double date, we were feeling like Barbecue, hence we decided to give Boneyard Grill a try since it was close to us.
Located across the Promenade Mall in a cute little plaza filled with great food options.
The venue has two entrances with ample seating with plenty of booths. The service was great and their menu has a great selection with reasonable prices.

Jen braved it out and tried their boneyard Meat lover for One combo: gigantic sized ribs served with a mix of sweet potato fries/ regular fries and slaw.

I on the other hand tried their Juicy Lucy burger with melted cheddar embedded in the meat patty, served with sweet potato fries and crispy onion fries."}
{"text":"This review is in reference to a delivery by uber. Yes, you can order from here from ubereats.

Overall the ordering process was pretty quick. I was very satisfied with the process itself.

The prices on the app don't look exactly like the ones in the online menu, but not that much more expensive.

I had the half rack ribs with shoe string fries. First, the packaging it comes in is decent looking and held up. The fries were on the bottom and at first I thought there was little, then I took the ribs off and they were all on the bottom of the box, a decent amount. There was this paper separating the ribs and the fries so u couldn't see the fries and while I get the point of the paper, once I cut into the ribs it came apart. I had to take them off into a plate.

The ribs themselves tasted delicious. Really nice char on the ribs and the sauce had those nice smokey flavor. The ribs fell off the bone. Overall they tasted really good.

The fries though were a disappointment. The were stale. I feel it partially had to do with the box not being breathable to keep them crispy but even then they'd just be soggy. In this case they tasted stale.

The steak sandwich and the BBQ chicken both looked very good.

Pretty convenient delivery option so might go with them again."}
{"text":"Having visited as a YELP Elite at an Elite only event - which was stupendously awesome - I knew I had to return as a regular customer to see if the quality and experienced remain the same, if not better! 

And it was!  The full rack of baby back ribs were out of this world delicious. Meat that falls off the bone, with just enough sauce to carry the flavor of the meats!  Crispy onion strings served as the garnish.  Smoky BBQ flavor to taste, all the deliciousness without the mess of a backyard BBQ.    Guaranteed finger licking good!

What better way to eat BBQ ribs than with BBQ wings. Juicy and succulent, perfect combination of the two!   The cook in the kitchen at this place really knows what he/she is doing given the high quality of food at the Boneyard Grill!

Great service also.  The waitress that served us from the Elite event evening also served us this visit. She didn't recognize us, however. At least, we don't think she did! 

I'd not hesitate to come back at a future date, though I hope they'd stay open a little later than 9pm in the future!"}
{"text":"Some of the better BBQ I've had in Toronto. Great for delivery. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Food was very good! I had the pork nachos, the other person had a splash and dash pizza. My only complaint was the service. My drink was empty most of the time I was there. And it took a very long time to get a server."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Considering the reviews I was expecting a lot more. We had the Giddy Up and Wicked burgers. Requested medium but both were well done and dry. Mentioned it to the waitress and she said she noticed they were on too long as the cook was busy and reminded him to take them off. The over cooked burgers explains why it took over forty minutes to get them. No discounts or comp desert was offered. Big fail for management on that one. Waitress was nice and fries were good otherwise the two star would have been zero. Sadly two hours later I still have sour stomach which is weird as the meat was well done. Might be the pulled pork on the wicked burger :("}
{"text":"This place is going downhill fast.  My first visit here was about 6 years ago.  I enjoyed the meals very much.  I have been back about half a dozen times and each time it gets worse and worse.  The upholstery on the chairs are falling apart, the bathrooms are filthy, food on the floor under our table that has probably been there for months and no one cares to clean it properly.  
Now on to the food.  Their wings are not good anymore.  No smoke flavour at all.  Ribs went from being amazing to awful.  They obviously are not using the same methods of cooking as they did years ago.  Their fries are one of my favourites. 
Burgers are decent but way too soggy.
Oh their menus are disgusting sticky with grease and with sauce.  They are laminated and look like they have been through two wars.   Filthy place.  Not clean."}
{"text":"Those burgers are finger licking good. Everything else that we ordered tastes mediocre ( I believe it was ribs and veggies). Service is pretty bad considering there're always empty."}
{"text":"Awesome food, tastes really good. The burger and the ribs are really delicious. Good service as well."}
{"text":"I was thinking this place could be my new burger joint.  I've been there probably four or five times and I've been generally satisfied.  The service needs improvement but they have a pretty good lunch special that we go for.

Sadly however this is an example of how one bad experience can ruin everything.  The last time we went we were served raw beef.  The bun was soaked red it was so rare, and no it wasn't the ketchup.  I could probably forgive something like this if it was handled properly by the staff but the whole experience was down right pathetic.  The waitress thought she brought the burger back from the kitchen when she hadn't, and we could clearly hear the cook insulting us saying how we \"don't know what a medium burger looks like\" and we \"shouldn't order a medium burger if you don't want it a little bloody\".  We left without waiting for the food to return.  Stay far away!"}
{"text":"Wholly this burger is good ... This place got one of the greatest burgers you should defiantly check it out ... Service was great and place look nice ... Bring ur girl friend what happen very u want."}
{"text":"Service has improved and food is good. Good beer selection. Stop in and give em a try."}
{"text":"The French fries were really good, the juicy Lucy and the wicked were really good as well !"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. I had the cowboy one with extra for sweet potatoes fries. Wow. It was awesone. Always been a huge fan of burgers, but this one is gonna full your belly. Arround 20$/ person. Worth the try!!

For people who want to go on the patio, can be fun, couple tables, but less service when your out (far from reach) and crowed street with lot of cars passing by... Would still go there again."}
{"text":"We've been to this place a couple of times. It is a 'meat-lovers Dream' that is an unexpected find along this Avenue Rd. Strip.

The only thing I have personally tried off their menu is the grilled chicken burger. And while the burger is moist and flavourful, it is the buttered bun that has me drooling for more.

Their sides are large but can be hit or miss. The only one I've reliably enjoyed were their Frites. Otherwise, my dad has ordered and enjoyed their side salad but it is a few dollars extra.

My other favourite part of this place is that they serve offerings from 'The Cheesecake Factory' both my all-time favourite the white-chocolate raspberry but also my second fav. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Prior to this place opening I was travelling all the way out to Etobicoke to indulge in these savory desserts, now I just have a short distance to go.

I know they do take out and I'm pretty sure they do delivery on the weekend. But all-in-all, a delicious place to dine."}
{"text":"I remember having a great experience with the service and food the first time I came here which made me come back. My date and I sat down to a pretty empty restaurant. There was another table that sat down after us, but a large amount of takeout orders. There was only our server Judy in the front of the house who took the calls and orders for everyone in the restaurant. She had a great personality and provided us with her opinions of the menu. We let Judy know that we were in a hurry that catch a movie, and she advised the kitchen of that.

We ordered drinks to start. They only had Steam Whistle on tap so I got a pint of that. I also ordered a pound of wings to start because she really promoted the kitchen's suicide sauce and how spicy it was. Unfortunately there was some kind of error or miscommunication with Judy and the kitchen. The wings came to the table and the suicide sauce was complete garbage. It was mild. I told Judy I could drink that sauce on the spot. Anyone who knows me, knows that I don't mess around with hot sauce. I was never so unimpressed about a hot sauce in my life. I wouldn't have ordered the wings if I knew in advance. We also ordered burgers for our entrees. They were good but not as good as how Judy hyped them out to be. Overall the service was great, with the exception on how much she exaggerated about the food there, and talking nonsense with her lack of knowledge on the condo market in Toronto. Overall it was a disappointing experience, and I might have to say the ribs might be the only thing to come back here for. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Generally been happy, however ever since they sold the place, the burger patty size has shrunk, the prices have gone up and the service has gone down. Further more, the quality has become inconsistent."}
{"text":"Decided I couldn't wait for the burger binge to begin.
Glad I didn't wait.

The place is real nice, a little small but nice.  The server was super pleasant and kept the coffee refills flowing.
First off, this is one of the few places I've been where they actually ask how you want your burger cooked.  That is a very large plus to me, shows they are comfortable with their skills and want to give guests the best experience possible.  I asked for and received a perfect medium.  The burger was fantastic they used real cheddar cheese and it does make a difference.  Initially I ordered the 5 oz burger but the server mentioned that the 8 oz included the drink and would cost about the same, so why not.  It was a real 8 oz too. Big and thick and juicy and awesome.
And the price?  8 oz burger (with real cheddar cheese!), fries and coffee with free refills for less than $13 taxes included?  That is amazing, especially considering the quality of the food served.

The only thing that I was not completely happy with was the fries, not that they were bad.  Just they were so thin that doing the finger pick and dip would take forever to eat them and it was a struggle to get enough but not too much on the fork.  But that's just nitpicking on my part.

Definitely will be going back to sample other offering from the menu."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. The Waitress recommended the lunch special which was a pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich for $8.95 - not too bad and it also came with a pile of super thin cut fries.

Since the lunch special was at such a great price I decided to get the meat lovers combo for $26.95 - decided to go with the half rack of baby back ribs and half pound of wings with a side of onion rings and coleslaw. The ribs were fall off the bone and the wings were done right. Crispy skin on the outside but still juicy on the inside. Although the food was good it was nothing I haven't had before at a rib fest and the price is definitely higher when compared to rib fests.

A very solid place to visit for some BBQ meats

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Ooohhhhh yeah! This place has some really good ribs!! I love the angus bones. They are so big and tasty. Just hits you in the face with flavour. Good price too. Loving it! The only thing I didn't love is the wings. They were slightly dry and too lean. Come on guys, wings need some fat! This is the perfect comfort food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food has always been awesome when chef Dave is there,  Ashleigh he looks stoned most of the time.  Not so much when his substitute are running the show.  Small and packed place. Limited wine selection.  Great desserts. Fair prices."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Service was average the ribs and fries were wonderful. Baked potato was dry and crumbly. I was hoping that a place named bone yard they would have brisket and burnt ends. I also thought the apps were pricey. I might consider going back if Kroger didn't have similar ribs for a better price."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Complete refusal to correct the order that I had placed, they just left me with an incomplete, incorrect order, even after I called to have it fixed."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and like so many times before, I decided what better way to find a place to eat, but to Yelp it? Living near Hwy 7 and Leslie, there are not many burger joints because I'm in the heart of northern Chinatown. I was pleasantly surprised to see Boneyard pop up because it's about a 10min drive from home. Upon looking at their menu, I was set on trying it out. The place has a wide assortment of burgers, including specialty burgers, as well as various BBQ items. The thing that sold me was that they have onion strings and an option of mixed fries (regular and sweet potato fries or half fries with half onion strings (for an extra charge). I love onion strings! 

I ordered the Crunchy Juicy Lucy burger. It has cheddar cheese inside the burger...yummy, melted cheddar cheese oozing out of the burger...and is topped with tomatoes, lettuce and onion strings!  Did I mention that the burger is a 10oz burger?  Also, the pile of fries is huge! Not to mention, they are super thin and not soggy. One other thing to mention is that they ask you how you'd like your burger cooked. The name of the burger is not a lie...it was super juicy and hot off the grill. Leaning over my fries and burger gave me a mini steam facial! 

My husband decided to order the ribs with the onion fries and coleslaw...and to be honest, up until this point, I have not had a rack of ribs that even comes close to my dad's BBQ'd ribs...not until today! Most places steam their ribs because it's faster to cook and so they fall off the bones, but this place does it the way BBQ should be done!  They even have their own BBQ sauce that you can buy.  Needless to say, they ribs were perfectly cooked and so flavourful!! Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that we started off with the French onion soup. I'm always on the lookout for a good onion soup that's not too salty and their's was pretty good. I personally like more cheese and bread, but I was happy enough that it wasn't overly salty. Over all, I really enjoyed everything that we ordered. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"A pleasant find! I was over in Madison for work and an overnight (see Holiday Inn review) and the BoneYards was where I wound up. Decorated with Harley orange about everywhere, my hopes were pretty high. Plenty of TVs with everything on imaginable. The menu sold us on what looked like really good bar food. 

The wings were really good - and flame grilled. And good sized at that. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, but not enough of them.

Then the pizza. The menu said fire baked and we were ready for crispy and cheesy put together. What a dissapointment. Flabby and gooey was more accurate. 

Dollar beers a always a good thing. 

I'll go with four stars since this is a fairly new place and a great environment, but I could have easily dropped to three if our waitress wasn't as freindly as she was."}
{"text":"Excellent fire grilled flatbed pizza.  The wings are on the fatty side as well as often burnt.  Sandwiches are a safe bet and with limited options in Upper Madison worthy of try. Some interesting trivia on the walls, especially regarding Miss Madison, the hydroplane boat. Take time to read the history & enjoy a few cold reasonably priced beers."}
{"text":"I went to Boneyard for the Savour York Region and was not disappointed. Despite the soup of the day and the chocolate cake from the menu having both run out, I was offered alternatives that were both excellent: a navy bean and vegetable soup that was rather hearty and a selection of cheesecakes.

Steak was done a little less than requested, but was beautifully seasoned and quite juicy. Grilled veggies were nicely done as well.

One thing that stood out here, especially for a restaurant in the area, was the service. Our waitress was warm and friendly and definitely knew what she was doing; a welcome change. Someone who appeared to be either the owner or manager was floating around the dining room throughout service and appeared to have a handle on and interest in what was going on. Much appreciated.

Only downfall to this place was the size; tables are really close together and we were able to hear our neighbours' conversations clearly and vice versa. My entree was delivered before I was half finished my soup (what can I say, I ate it slowly), so there's something to say for the timing in the kitchen while the place is busy/maybe it gave the juices in the steak time to settle. The plates used are a strange rectangular shape, making the tables seem even smaller than they are already and increasing the claustrophobia.

Recommended, provided claustrophobia isn't an issue for you or you like chatting with the people at the next table."}
{"text":"Come prepared to bring home another meal! The first thing you'll need to know is that portion sizes are absolutely massive.

I really liked the philly cheese steak sandwich I had, which I dipped in the Chipotle mayo they provided (not sure if I was supposed to!). My colleagues commented that they wish the Chipotle mayo was spicier. The onion straws had too much batter and too little onion. They're small and hard to pick up. Next time, I'll get the salad - the next table over received massive salads that I feel would be worth the $2.50 premium. Everything seems to be made fresh which is great! The unfortunate part is that it took longer since everything is so customisable (philly cheese chicken sandwch? philly cheese steak sandwich?).

The prices seem to fall around $10 before tax and tip. They also do weekend brunches now and were promoting it through a contest."}
{"text":"Got the meat lovers for 1 with a half rack of ribs and the quarter chicken dark. The meat was cooked really really well and everything was super juicy and the sauce was out of this world. I love the portion it was perfect for me to finish and be satisfied. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Damn i was so hyped for so long to try Boneyards burgers, and gotta say even though their huge, its so underwhelming.

I got the juicy lucy specialty burger and it had absolutely no salt or seasoning. I love the fact you can order your burger the way you want, so i got medium and it came out well done.

The shoestring frys are blahhh, Mc d's across the plaza is a better bet...."}
{"text":"Decided to come back after our awesome experience at a Yelp event. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger and it was delish! Instead of regular fries, I ordered sweet potato fries instead. They were super generous with the portion. I actually had to pack some home! The burger was nice and juicy, exactly how I like it. 

The coconut shrimp was nice but the price is a bit steep for 5 pieces. The two dipping sauce was wonderful! 

Would definitely be back again! Felt the waitress was too busy flirting with one of the chefs at the back. But otherwise, service was great & food came pretty quick. They also have my last meal to have on earth.... the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. OMG ! Next time I should starve myself the whole day so I could eat that too."}
{"text":"they added a deep fryer it seems. can't blame them, i guess, the midwest DEMANDS ITS POISON.

edit: they added fries, but they are baked. more new menu items have been added."}
{"text":"Ordered the Savour York set menu for $35, came with and appetizer, main and a dessert. For an appetizer I had the coconut shrimp, which were a decent size, but full of flavour, you can really taste the coconut in the breading. As a main, I had the ribs, and that sauce was just awesome, not too sweet. The meat was nice and tender, and cooked to perfection. The choice of meat was top quality. 

The service was quick and accommodating to our needs. The servers all came over to say hello and see the girls. 

It's a nice spot and will defiantly like to go back to try other item on the menu."}
{"text":"The service was extremely friendly. The food was really really good (ribs and wings) although took a little while to come out - but was so worth the wait. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with the food here.  I had the rainbow trout with grilled veggies.  It was excellent.  The fish was fresh and flavourful"}
{"text":"This place is just a stone's throw from the Promenade Mall. Went here with the family for my brother-in-law's birthday. Their food is mostly hamburgers, ribs, etc. But they did have a couple of seafood entrees & a veggie burger. I went for the Rainbow Trout entree which was a half of the fish, filleted.  The trout tasted really fresh & I shelled out an extra 1.50 for sweet potato fries which were done really nicely. Not too greasy or soft. Just the right amount of freshness. There was also a type of mango salsa on the side which was good but I wasn't in the mood for it that day.

Wait service was prompt, friendly and competent. We gave her a nice tip. This isn't a big restaurant, so if you have a group of 12 ppl or more I would suggest a larger place. But for our group of 9 it was fine because there weren't many other people there on a Sunday afternoon. Most people seemed to have ordered take out & came to pick it up instead of eating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends at 8pm - 1 hour before closing. The minute I walked in I felt super rushed. One of my friends didn't even bother ordering because she felt so rushed. To be honest, service does play a huge role in the restaurant experience. It was almost so unprofessional that the waitress was expressing her need to go home ON TIME... we literally hardly got through our meals without feeling the need to go QUICK before 9pm. It was so unfortunate.

I've eaten here before and recommended this place to my friend, and was expecting the same experience the second time around. 

The food is great, don't get me wrong, but the service was so unruly. It was unfortunate. I ordered the juicy lucy. Fries are good. Burger was good. 

It was just unfortunate that we were treated that way."}
{"text":"My friend and I got the pleasure of attending the grand opening of Boneyard Grill's Toronto location near Lawrence station. The interior setup is much like a family diner, unlike most BBQ restaurants I have been to. We got to try an array of their popular dishes, notable their ribs and coconut shrimps! I have to admit, I don't remember having ribs so delicious and tender before! The meat simply melted off the bones! My friend and I kept piling our plates with them! The pulled pork sliders and chicken wings were tasty as well, among their other menu items. Honestly, none of the food I tried disappointed me.

If Boneyard Grill opened late, I think it would be a perfect place to go to after some late-night partying. It's also a good family dinner if everyone is craving for some delicious BBQ! If you aren't in the midtown area, they have their original location up in Thornhill."}
{"text":"UPDATE (01/28/2018): STILL PISSED.

NEVER, EVER order from here through UberEats. It was complete garbage. The burger was so soggy, completely WET. The fries were ROCK HARD. Basically crunchy, wet sticks of greasy. It was as if they were at least a few days old. Completely inedible -- and I was starving so not like I was being picky. Also, I didn't think it was necessary to specify I wanted ketchup on my burger, as that seemed pretty standard to me, so the burger came very dry, no condiments. There weren't even ketchup packets in the bag to (try to) eat the fries with. What a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ!! The menu is not extensive, but if you are looking for good BBQ in the area, this is it. Nice portions, good, attentive staff and reasonable prices. Have been back a few times and always consistent."}
{"text":"After first sampling what Boneyard Grill had to offer at an event a while back, I've come back a couple of times, and have been just as impressed with the food and experience.

SERVICE:

Came on a Friday night, and it wasn't too busy. The servers here are friendly and helpful, and offered up a couple of good recommendations. 

FOOD:

We ordered the \"Coconut Tiger Shrimps,\" which was nicely breaded, spiced, and came with two dipping sauces (one mango-based, and one plum). Was happiest about the \"Pulled Pork Sandwich\" though - this thing was filling, as it was jammed with pork and stuffed with crispy onion strings. As a big lover of onion strings, I was glad they offered the option of having them as a side instead of fries/salad. Though not really necessary, the dish also came with a nice little cole slaw to balance the meal.

VERDICT:

This place has some pretty good ribs, burgers, and the like, so I'll be back for that next time!"}
{"text":"FINALLY, I found a burger place that worth wasting calories in. I read good reviews about this place and decided to go and try it today. Their burger and fries is delicious, the portions are big and very filling. Staff are friendly and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressed with this place!

Right beside my office, we decided to walk over here one lunch to check it out, not expecting much (this stretch of avenue road doesn't have too many great options). 

The prices are great and the portions, even better! Most of their lunch specials are around $10 and trust me, you will be stuffed. Can't go wrong.

On my first visit I tried the lunch special: pilly cheese steak with a pop and a side for $10. I opted for the half-and-half fries for my side (half regular/half sweet potato). Portion was HUGE and had to take half home (which re-heated nicely btw), and quality was really good and food came out hot and fresh (and quick - a definite plus). Would definitely order again!

Have also tried the beef brisket and burger, both of which were also great ~

*Only possible downfall is that they have the really skinny 'shoe-string' style fries -which I happen to love - but some of my colleagues were not fans. Other than that, it's a great place and worth checking out if you are in the area :)"}
{"text":"When you stumble across a restaurant with the slogan 'Really Wicked BBQ' you know it's going to be good! Boneyard Grill has graced Toronto with its second location of mouth-watering BBQ eats.

Boneyard Grill is known for their baby back ribs made with a signature secret sauce that includes over 20 ingredients passed down from an old South African family recipe.  The menu also includes burgers, wings, sandwiches, salads and  much more.

The new location at Yonge and Lawrence has a neighbourhood-friendly vibe to it which is welcoming to the BBQ restaurant scene.  I find a lot of the trendier BBQ joints tend to have a bit of a superior attitude and the service can be lacking.  Thankfully the service  at Boneyard was extremely efficient and everyone seemed genuinely interested to find out your thoughts about the food.

I ended up trying many items from the menu and was quite impressed with the flavour and quality of each dish.  The wings were cooked perfectly and the meat fell right off the bone. The sliders were juicy and full of flavour and I actually ate them with no condiments, they were THAT good.  The baby-back ribs were of course my favourite.  The meat was unbelievably tender and the ribs weren't doused in powerful BBQ sauce which was nice. The fries were not my favourite which I'm ok with since I would only come here for the BBQ items anyway.

Boneyard Grill is a casual spot for the meat-loving type and although salads and sandwiches are on the menu, you have to come here for the BBQ'd goods. Their food is reasonably priced, portions are huge, and flavour is not an issue!"}

At Boneyard Grill, $9.99 gets you a 10oz Sirloin Beef Burger, Fries and Drink is not bad at all.

My friendly waitress welcomes me and reminds me about the lunch specials... she doesn't realize that's the reason I am here!

The patty can be cook medium well or even medium, I opt for medium. However, I found though it is cooked with a hint of pink inside, the patty is kind of on the dry side. Maybe because Top Sirloin is just a little too lean... too healthy? I want my juicy fatty burger!!

Shoestrings Fries are light and crispy, which I enjoy! 

Drinks here for a can of pop is $2.25 which is included in the combo.. you can upgrade that to other drinks with additional charges.

Services is so good... I cannot believe I am at a Rib and Burger Joint?! Real Napkins not the paper type? Nice Table setting? The decoration remembers me of Italian restaurants....

Tuesday AYCE Ribs for $24.95... apparently Boneyard has their house brand BBQ sauce... I wondering how many ribs can I eat? Maybe I should test my limit!!"}
{"text":"I love sports bars.. It's about the only place in the world left that I could possibly get into a fight at! I'm not much of a fighter though, I'm more the beer drinking, fried food eating, football game watching type!
This place has all those things covered nicely! 
I got some cheap beers, some onion rings, a flatbread type vegan pizza, and a big old tv showing my Vikings all to myself! 
Can't really complain! Waitress was nice, but left half way through the game, I took care of my tab with her so I could tip her out, and then I was left stranded with no beer for half the game.. Have no fear, I went and asked for another and I got my beer, my Vikings won, and I left feeling a little buzzed from a happy victory and lots of cheap beers! Thanks Boneyard for making me feel at home in a strange place! PS might be the only place in town with NFL Ticket!"}
{"text":"The food is great here! The beef and pork ribs are both fantastic way better then the stuff u get at rib fest. Been here at least 4 times now and it has always been very consistent. 

Last night missed the mark a little cause it was pretty busy.  The food and service was slow.  But I suppose everyone has their off days.  If you're looking for ribs this is a nice spot to check out."}
{"text":"So happy that there's finally a burger restaurant that you can go and sit and feel like you're at an actual restaurant. The food was great and their thin cut fries make them unique. I was only upset that my burger came well done and not medium like I asked it made the burger very dry but was still pretty good. The server could have been a little more helpful rather than offering me sauce to make it easier to digest but I'm still willing to give the place another shot."}
{"text":"As a lover for all things BBQ, I enjoyed the burger. It was not as succulent as I would hope. It needs to be juicier! The burger is just not dirty enough! The sweet potato fries were dellcious! They were cripsy and crunchy!"}
{"text":"Ayce ribs. Cant go wrong really. Service isnt so great and honestly if i asked for coleslaw as my side it wouldve been nice to fyi it comes with coleslaw so i wouldnt end up with 2 bowls of coleslaw. Also washrooms need to be kept more clean it is a restaurant afterall."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant when visiting friends that live in the area. The restaurant itself is not very large and is located in the \"village\" of shops that surround the Walmart. 
On the day we were there (cold, windy, winter's day), a cold wind blew threw the restaurant every time the door opened (the restaurant does not have double doors, which would prevent his from happening) but I'm sure in the summer this wouldn't be an issue.
We sat in a booth near the bar area. Style is typical pub fare. 
FOOD
There were 4 of us having lunch.
I had the burger combo ($9.99) for a 10oz burger, fries (shoestring fries) and pop. It was good...not great.
2 people had the ribs ($14.95), fries and coleslaw. They smelled incredible and they woofed them down, so I would assume they were good (they were slathered in sauce). I'll go back as they said they were good and now I must try them.
The 4th person had wings, fries and coleslaw. Said the wings were \"ok\" which is code for \"disappointing\".

As they carry Cheesecake Factory desserts, we had to indulge (strictly for reference when thinking about writing a review). We had the Godiva Cheesecake and the Red Velvet cake. The Godiva cake was incredible, the red velvet a disappointment (it was dry and tasted a bit stale). 

All in all,  not a bad place. I will go back as I see they're in Savour Vaughan for 2013, plus I have to try the ribs....."}
{"text":"We came here for Savour York Region, which I thought was a great deal. The restaurant was difficult to find, but we eventually found the place after calling. The restaurant has a ton of TVs, much like a sports bar. But the kitchen has a open window, which makes it fun to look inside.

We started with a caesar salad and coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp were really nice and tasted like coconut. We enjoyed the orange sauce more than the yellow sauce. For mains, we ordered the rainbow trout and the half ribs. For a place that's known for burgers and ribs, they did a really good job on the fish. It was flavorful and flaky. The ribs were amazing. They separated from the bone very easily. I was surprised that there were so many ribs (we took half of it home). For dessert, they ran out of chocolate mousse, so the waitress offered us cheesecake. We ordered the plain cheesecake and the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake. I didn't like the raspberry cheesecake as much as the plain cheesecake.

Overall, we had a good dining experience here. The service and food were excellent. I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Went there today food was excellent I had the pulled pork and girlfriend has the burger both were amazing. Pulled pork has no BBQ sauce which is nice compared to the usual pulled pork you get slathered in sauces. Burger was cooked medium rare and tasted absolutely great. Shoestring French fries were good but not great overall five star experience will definelty be back for lunch.

Bill total $26 including tip"}
{"text":"Food was alright but had the laziest and worst bartender I've ever have waited 15 before he ask I we wanted a beer asked for a chilled shot he put it in the cooler and sat on his phone waiting for it to cool down wow"}
{"text":"Went here for Burger Binge Week 2nd yelping (twice).  The burger they have is quite good compared to their next door Binge provider.  I think they should make the combination a regular item on the menu.  But for reference (as copied from the Burger Binge Week post)

Our no fuss 5 oz Classic burger topped with cheddar cheese, BBQ chipotle, lettuce, tomato, pickles, bacon and stacked onion straws

The combination just blended well in my mouth.

The environment is pretty casual, but the staff look pretty classy for the environment.

The second time I went here was for takeout where I took home their beef ribs and an onion brick.  Loved the taste when I got home with it.

The 5-star rating was for the experience at the Burger Binge Week.  And I will have to come back here for a 3rd time with a larger crowd of different friends and family so we can enjoy more."}
{"text":"If you have a large appetite and love meat, this place is for you. The portion sizes are crazy, Be prepared take some home. And by all means that is not a complaint at all. It was amazing, 4 of us went and all of us enjoyed it. I had the burger stuffed with cheese, and fries, it was incredible. The burger was cooked to perfection, juicy, flavourful, and rhe amount of cheese in the center was awesome. 3 others I was with had the phily cheesesteak, steak sandwich with mushroom and swiss and the burger in lettuce wrap. All of the were unbelievale. We were all stuffed by the end of the meal. The service was incredible, or cups did not get empty before we were offered more, we were served right away, good conversation was made, pointers were made. We had a wonderful time and will definitly be back for more. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I checked out their new venue with a group of foodies just after it opened.  Their dipping sauces are fabulous and the pulled pork and skinny onion rings were probably my favourite things.  Combine them in one bun and you have a great sandwich."}
