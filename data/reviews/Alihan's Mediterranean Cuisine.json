{"text":"Have eaten at Alihan's twice this summer before Pirate's games. Food has been delicious and the service has been attentive. Great place to eat before an event!"}
{"text":"Came here on a visit to Pittsburgh looking for something fresh and (relatively) healthy after a long day of sightseeing. The very friendly hostess seated us immediately on the patio and returned quickly with water and menus. My daughter (a vegetarian) and I split the cold appetizer combination plate, which had a little bit of everything. Delish! The dish was fresh, attractively presented, with substantial portions, and accompanied by a basket of warm bread. The charred eggplant and the salty feta were outstanding - so good that my daughter ordered a second serving of the eggplant for dessert! The only thing I'd change would be to add a bit more garlic and salt to the hummus.  For entrees, I had the lamb shishkebab with bulgur, and my daughter had the vegetarian saute. Both were delicious. The lamb was tender and tasty, and enough for a full meal plus leftovers to take home. The saute, a mix of vegetables in a tomato-based sauce, was flavorful and satisfying. Service throughout was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed it all.  The meal wasn't cheap, but we found it well worth the price for good quality and portion sizes. We seriously considered returning the next day for another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"An unexpected pleasure!  We missed brunch at Gastropub by a couple minutes after 2 on a Sunday and happened on Alihan's where we were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the hostess/server, Diana, and by the delicious and reasonably priced fresh Mediterranean Homemade Cuisine.  We started with freshly homemade delicious bread and a mixed cold platter which we three shared.  This was almost a full meal for the three and quite interesting and delicious.  Then we followed with a shared lamb shish kebab with bulgur, also interesting and tasty (the guys had the lamb though, not me.  But I had the bulgur, very good).  We fortunately decided to try the desert which I found out were also homemade like the bread.  These were such high quality, not too sweet and absolutely delicious!  We shared the baklava which was made with pistachios not walnuts, and the cannoli which was stuffed with a ricotta like creamy filling, so delicious.  Thank you Diana for making us welcome in our casual attire to your lovely restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! A fantastic place to go to before a pirates game or show due to it's convenient location minutes from PNC Park and all the theaters in the cultural distinct.   I'm a very picky eater, so I ordered chicken sauté with red sauce and was very pleased! The chicken was mixed with vegetables in a perfect ratio and portion size was perfect. I left feeling satiated but not overly stuffed as I often do when I eat out. The service is also next to none! Within minutes I felt like I was apart of the family and cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Alihan's a couple of times and it was FANTASTIC both times.  There doesn't really seem to be a weak point in the restaurant.  The service is attentive and excellent.  The appetizers, entrees, and desserts are consistently high quality and it is clear that they make everything on site.  I have had my share of baklava and it is immediately obvious if someone makes it or buys it.  I can definitely say they make their own at the restaurant which is a sign of the level to which they take the food there.  So far we have tried the mixed grill which was wonderful, the mixed appetizer platter (which could be a wonderful meal in itself) and the iskender kabob which I am still daydreaming about.  Also, every time we have been there, there were many Turkish people there which is always a good sign for a turkish restaurant--if people who have eaten the cuisine all of their lives like it and go back, it must be pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the previous reviews.  I got the mixed plate.  The lamb was ok, however, very overcooked and dry.  My wife ordered the chicken in cream.  It was worse than dog food.  Service was less than mediocre.  The worse part for me was that they had no coffee, at all.  What kind of Mediterranean place doesn't have coffee?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a delight - It is a wonderful restaurant especially before or after a downtown cultural event. I have been many times and always have had excellent, friendly waiters and the menu has a large selection and variety -- the food is  delicious and nicely plated. White tablecloths but not pretentious. The windows open out on warmer days and you see and feel the vibe of people walking past."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner because it was there, and discovered really excellent food and lovely service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is a great find in the cultural district in Pittsburg. Great appetizers, salads and lamb. Free glass of chianti that is actually pretty good. The mixed cold appetizer plate is a must and so is the chef borek. Ask for hazal!"}
{"text":"The Chef Brek was amazing and the service was spectacular. My beef kabob was juicy and tender. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the lamb chops kebab were amazing, def coming back. Love the food and if you are gluten free highly recommend this place :-)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is on fleck  & the food is amazing  Also the service Really nice choice"}
{"text":"We made a pre-show (a wonderful production of \"South Pacific\") reservation for a Friday evening dinner at Alihan's after seeing a few ads in the Post-Gazette. We like Mediterranean food but had never eaten in a Turkish restaurant & weren't quite sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. White table cloths and a friendly reception told us we had made a good choice. After sharing a delicious \"Chef Borek\" appetizer of goat cheese & leeks baked in phyllo and served with a tomato marmalade, we each enjoyed grilled kabob-type dinners - one chicken & one lamb. The accompaniments (bulgur wheat and rice pilaf) were excellent. The meat was ground and did not actually come on a skewer. Tasty, but next time we will choose non-ground options. It's a BYOB place, but we were each offered (and gratefully accepted) one generous glass each of complimentary wine with our entrees. We enjoyed a dessert of baklava, along with Turkish tea and coffee. The staff was genuinely friendly and attentive. We will certainly go back - show or not!"}
{"text":"The food was bland but pricey, the tables were crowded close together, and the service was mediocre. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Gorgeous and spacious downtown setting close to the theaters/cultural district. LOVE the outdoor seating and proximity to PNC Park. Service before a show on a weekend was very prompt. Get the drinks and desserts and veggie entrees--you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best part of this meal was when, halfway through, they brought us complimentary glasses of wine. Maybe that's normal here?  We had the lamb with peppers/onions (hold the mushrooms) and red sauce served with bulgur, and the salmon with peppers/onions/mushrooms with cream sauce over rice. The food was good but nothing that really wowed us. It was, however, my dining companion's first time having either bulgur or hummus (not sure how the hummus one hadn't happened before...) so that was fun!"}
{"text":"Delish food with high quality, nice atmosphere, and great service. My second best Turkish restaurant in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the cultural district. fast dinner on our way to a Pirates game. Terrific cold appetizers (especially the baba and eggplant marinara) and perfectly-cooked lamb shish kebab. The manager says they'll publish a takeout menu soon."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door by Joey. It was great from the moment he said welcome to Alihan's. Sadly, we didn't get to meet Ali.  I had the lamb shish kabob and my wife had the falafel. Both were delicious! We had our free glasses of wine and they were a nice touch. We also sat outside in 65 degree weather and a gentle breeze. The atmosphere was great.  After we were stuffed, Joey offered us free baklava for the small price of a Facebook check-in. We obliged; you should too. We are traveling through, but this is some solid Mediterranean. Eat here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to get dinner here on Light Up Night. It was a nice escape from the crowd (and cold), and though the restaurant was pretty full, we were seated immediately. The atmosphere was very nice, though I felt cramped at our table. The proximity of the adjacent table made getting in and out of the booth a little tricky.  We ordered the Chef Borek appetizer and doner kebab with wheat bulgur. The appetizer, goat cheese in fried phyllo dough, was delicious both with and without the tomato marmalade. One order has one piece. The entrée also came with salad. Everything was beautifully plated and delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I scraped up every last grain of bulgur.  Our waiter was attentive and nice. Overall, it was a very nice, relaxing, and enjoyable dinner. I'll definitely be back when I have an excuse for a treat."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered tonight was absolutely delicious. Our waiter Rishad (my spelling may be off) was very pleasant and helpful with having our three young children along. For an upscale atmosphere, we were relieved to see a kids menu and they enjoyed the food as well. My kabobs were cooked just right without being dry and still tender with excellent flavor. My wife had a shrimp dish with generous serving of perfectly cooked shrimp. I would highly recommend this restaurant... and not think twice about bringing your kids."}
{"text":"Fantastic Place!! Not been disappointed here yet. Great pricing for lunch, fresh food and great flavors. Try the rice pudding- phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The host was great and seated us right away with a friendly smile at the door of the restaurant. Once we were seated, the nicest adorable waitress in the world served us and we were treated to the best Mediterranean food I've ever had the pleasure of tasting!!! The appetizer was small, but it was so DELICIOUS. Anyway, go there or be square. Also, my friend Rosemary gives this joint a 11/10.   UPDATE  Went back with a few of my gal pals from down the street. Was delighted to see that we could all be seated in a jiffy! Service was simply magnificent and the food took my taste buds on an unforgettable journey. Even Hazel and her picky appetite adored her salad. We saw a slogan that said \"when you are seated at our table, you're family\" and I felt more like family tonight than ever before!!  -Rosemary"}
{"text":"I found Alihan's on Yelp while looking for a nice downtown Pittsburgh restaurant that could provide a fair amount of vegetarian options which is usually possible with Mediterranean fare. Because their menu is posted on Yelp it made my choice easy. While turning onto 6th Street from Duquesne Blvd. ( while using the map app associated with Yelp) we noticed a parking garage directly beside Alihan's . Upon entering we were seated and ordered appetizers . Hummus and charred eggplant. My wife ordered falafels and I ordered lamb chop kebab . Service was superb as the waitress described our dishes and offered to answer any other questions that we may have had . Meals were served in a very timely fashion and were delicious. The atmosphere was very classy and modern yet the price was very fair in my opinion. We enjoyed our meal and coffee and did not leave hungry (we took a couple items home ) .  The dessert menu looked great but we were too full to partake.  We look forward to returning and exploring the rest of the menu ."}
{"text":"Alihan's is a gem!  Our family has a Middle Eastern/North African background and have high standards for staples such as hummus, babaghanoush, oils, etc.  Alihan's was fantastic.  Great bread, too.  Definitely recommend and will definintely go back.  Five BIG stars."}
{"text":"Great little place right across from the Renaissance hotel. Had takeout several times now while working in Pittsburgh. Awesome flavor in every bite. I recommend any of the grilled meat kabobs. Price is unbelievable for how much food you get.   The manager (or owner maybe?) works in both in the kitchen and front of the house and oversees everything that comes across the pass. Whatever they are doing, its working. Great food and very consistent every time I order.   I've never eaten in the dining room but everything appears to be very clean and well kept including the partially open kitchen.   Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite or takeout."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh with a small group of family and our dinner at Alihan's was one of the highlights of the trip. We sat outside on a warm evening which added to the enjoyment.   As we were a group we started with some orders of hummus and labne and were delighted by the delicious Turkish bread! Every single entree was incredible. I myself had the shrimp and ravioli. Some in my party had big salads. Our server was easy going, kind, and made good recommendations. When the bill came we were surprised that it wasn't much over $100 for such a great evening with 6 adults.  You can bring your own alcohol, which we did not know. However each person was offered a complimentary glass of wine (red or white), and that was just what we needed to accompany the meal."}
{"text":"Alihan served us an excellent vegetarian lunch for a very reasonable price. The cold mezze plate, falafel, börek and lentil soup were all delicious. Finishing with Turkish coffee and baklava helped us warm up on a cold Pittsburgh day!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family during the Christmas holiday.  I am Persian, and it is really hard to find any good middle eastern restaurants in the Pittsburgh region.  Alihans does a good job at bringing a scarce cuisine to the Pittsburgh region. To start, our family ordered the mixed cold appetizer platter, and I ordered the lamb kababs for my meal. Both were Delish!  Don't forget to order some Turkish coffee, mmmmm :-)"}
{"text":"Best hummus I've ever had, great appetizers. I got the lamb in eggplant and wasn't a fan but I think I'm just picky. Would love to go back and try something else and will be dreaming of that hummus."}
{"text":"Lunch service was good .  Joseph was a good Server he explained the differences in the dishes Turkish style. The lamb kabob was very good as was the eggplant. They proved to be Service Fog Friendly which at first the young lady was hesitant. However all was well. The food was good. And I would recommend the restaurant to others.  They do not have a liquor license however offer a compliment white or red wine."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. The only negative about this place is that it was 85 degrees in there. I would recommend some ceiling fans at the very least."}
{"text":"A really terrific post-show dinner.  Everything was delicious.  Kebabs for two could have fed three... but nothing went to waste.  Appetizers excellent - cheese stuffed phyllo, calamari, and cold plate  all great. Highly recommend. Service a little slow, but nice not to be rushed out even though they were full. Is byob- a bar would be nice."}
{"text":"Thank you to Alihan's, and the wonderful staff for accommodating 10 Moms on a night out. We all treasure good food, and do a lot of cooking. I'm really happy to say that EVERYTHING was fresh and delicious. I only wish that we could have lingered a little longer, but we were catching a show. Highly encourage people to enjoy this experience. We will all be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my mother went here on a Saturday night, and it was fantastic. The decor looked modern, and the atmosphere felt pretty classy. Our waitress was nice, and we were seated almost immediately. We tried the calamari, which could have used a tiny bit more seasoning, but was delicious nonetheless. The Turkish bread was unexpectedly flavorful. My mom tried the Lamb Shish Kebab, and I tried the Lamb Adana Kebab. The kebab was probably one of the most tender and juicy pieces of meat I've ever tasted. The rice really tied the dish together. Overall, Alihan's is a great restaurant for lunch and probably an even better place for a date. I have to try the baklava the next time I come here. I heard it was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The food is borderline gross, not sure how this place is rated so well? Def not coming back...ever. The TRUTH lies in the \"48 not currently recommended comments\" at the bottom of the page. Wish I would've checked that before I went to this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Staff was very helpful in recommendations and it's byob! Great place to visit before seeing a show in town."}
{"text":"This place is so under-rated.  The food is superb and it's in the heart of the cultural district so it's a great place to eat before or after a performance."}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh over the Thanksgiving weekend, and after eating Primanti Bros. and pizza and fries, we were ready to eat some salad and rice.. you know, \"real\" food. Thank God we found Alihan's. We were travelling with our 18month old and he was still sleeping by dinner time so it was nice to know they delivered to our hotel. We ordered the Mixed Grill, the grilled sea bass, calamari and charred eggplant dip. The calamari was still crispy, the meats were flavorful, but the best part was the grilled fish, especially with a squeeze of the grilled lemon. The food would have obviously stayed at temperature if we had eaten at the restaurant, and it would have been nice to have some olive oil for the bread and dip, so next time we're in Pittsburgh we will stop by. Thanks again for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Oh man! This place is awesome! Toooo good! I mean I'm half Turk and these guys are doing a great job! You taste alll the details and spices! Nice and clean place! Oh btw I was visiting for D.C and I'm glad picked this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious meal before the show. Shrimp sauté and bulgar was  incredibly good. I wanted to pick up the plate and get every last drop. My friend had the chicken shush kebab which was just as good.   We were seated at the bar since we didn't have reservations (which I would definitely recommend). Service seemed a little slow (over 1 hour) but it was worth the wait!!  Plan to visit soon with other friends!"}
{"text":"Great grilled Seabass and Calamari. No liquor license yet but we brought our own beer and liquor so meal was extra cheap."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the mixed cold appetizer plate and it was so tasty.  The stuffed grape leaves were the best I've ever had.  The Labne yogurt with the sour apple slices was a unique favor combination in a very good way.  I also had the Shepherd Salad and it was so fresh and crisp! I loved the dill mixing with all the other flavors in the salad.  For desert, we shared the Kadayif which was a square of shredded phyllo dough with chopped walnuts and a dollop of cream on top.  I loved it but my wife thought it was too sweet.  We will definitely be back to try some kebabs and next time I will bring some Efes beers since they are BYOB."}
{"text":"I have walked past this place several times but today I finally made it for a late lunch after a play.  I have added several photos.  This place had quite a few vegetarian options including lentil soup which was good.  The hummus wad very nice although it came with bread and not pita . Chicken shish kebab exceeded my expectations and was well done!  We didn't have any room for dessert. The highlight was the friendliest floor staff I have seen after a long time ( wish I could remember her name). Clean nice interior and good food,  I'm coming back soon! !"}
{"text":"We came with a large party. The place was nice and service was good. The food not so much. I have had way better lentil soup and salads for a lot cheaper and better medit places."}
{"text":"Drove from Philadelphia directly to Alihan's after discovering it on yelp under halal food. I choose the adana kabob with rice and salad. My food was good but wife's food was not. She had a Greek salad with boneless chicken on top. It was just too salty and not entirely edible. Salad was just lettuce, and maybe 4-5 olives with a lot of cheese. In all it was an ok dining experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb kebabs good flavor nice spiciness....not your typical kebabs on a stick more like formed lamb sticks....pilaf was moist and I enjoyed it but no real seasoning in it.... the seasoning in the kebabs made up for it .....wait staff was attentive.....overall it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Tap water-ok  Do not eat doner, not the real thing   The reason for not giving one star is that there is Kunefe as a dessert."}
{"text":"Best food in Pittsburgh. I got the lamb shish kabob, hummus, and charred eggplant with my boyfriend who got chicken Adana. Everything was insanely good. Best hummus in Pittsburgh too, this is coming from a couple who has had great food from all over the world. We were very impressed. Great service, BYOB- they gave me a complimentary glass of wine since we didn't know it was BYOB, and a free dessert for checking in on Facebook! Friendly and attentive staff, great presentation, music, clean, and most of all, authentic!!  We will be making many more appearances, this place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Megan did an outstanding job of not punishing us since we did not BYOB.  Nice glass of chardonnay hit the spot.  We also enjoyed the lovely appetizer platter.  The lahne was exceptionally delicious.   The tabbouleh was fresh with a nice light taste.  Oh and the bread was the best!!! Great find."}
{"text":"I love to give 6 stars awesome food candid staff wonderful ambience and reasonable price.i had a wonderful time and a fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"Personal Favorites: Lamb Chops  Style: Turkish & Mediterranean  Ambiance: Simple and well designed, family atmosphere biggest plus is you can sit outside.  Service: Fast and caring service.  Note: Alihan is such a nice guy that personally show his big smile to all his customer. Quality of food is going to make you feel that you are in a Restaurant in Istanbul. Soft music  at the background is well chosen. Turkish Tea is a standard service after a meal but you can also ask for Legendary Turkish Coffee. Pittsburgh's one only great quality Turkish Restaurant. Well done Alihan. See you soon"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, awesome service....simply superb! I recommed the appetizer plate to begin with. The lamb is amazing here, so any lamb dish is a safe bet. I tried almost everything at Alihans, and all is highly recommended. For dessert, my fav is baklava..."}
{"text":"The hummus was wonderfully creamy and the freshly baked bread was a delight.  My husband and I ordered the mixed kabob platter.  It was enough food for three people.  The chicken Adana was my favorite but everything was good.  For dessert we shared a Turkish pastry similar to baklava but with an angel hair crust.    The service was exceptional.  I let my purse behind and they went to extraordinary measures to track me down.    I will definitely revisit Alihan's if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Just a really lovely meal all around. The white bean salad with lamb shish was the perfect summer supper- not heavy and well seasoned. The lamb was cooked perfectly! I also recommend the grilled vegetables as a starter; so tasty! Sit out on the sidewalk if the weather cooperates. Nice spot for people watching."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and timely.  Food was great too.   Falafel with greens, kafta chicken kebabs with rice and baked eggplant parmigiana. Turkish bread with delicious olive oil and black olive dipping was served up before the meal.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever! Never had food that delicious even in Turkey itself!!!! Everything is just delicious!! If you go to Pittsburgh you must go there and try Their Creme Caramel!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great option in the cultural district!!! Food was delicious and service was great! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean option in downtown. Lunch options are wide and $10 each. Hefty portions of meat, rice, and veggies. Speedy and friendly service. Steps from the business and cultural district."}
{"text":"The waitress were very slow and didn't serve well. They took a wrong order from me and my friend and when we asked the check, it took forever to bring it, so we left the restaurant because we were in rush. It made me more angry when i gave up my money about %30 tip."}
{"text":"Great place, ambiance, music and friendly staff.  Delicious turkist halal food but an expensive one. Price is a bit high but food is high quality. I had Lamb kebab which was very juicy and tasty. You must try Turkish tea which adds more flavor to your stomach. It'll help digest food too.  I'll for sure go there and recommend it to anyone who wants to have different and new cuisine to try for a change."}
{"text":"I ordered hummus, lentil soup, Iskender kebab, and a gyro from UberEats. Everything was off - the hummus and soup never arrived, the gyro came with rice instead of fries, and the gyro had no sauce. Not one drop of sauce on the cold dry meat. Seriously? I'm giving this place 2 stars because I think I once ate in house and liked it, but don't sign up with a delivery service if you're not able to provide ANY semblance of a decent product."}
{"text":"I am a picky eater from Asia but the food at Alihan's is fresh and delicious! Service is friendly and fast, very courteous and makes you feel taken care of. Alihan, the owner is always there making sure everything is tip-top. The interior is very modern, everything is very clean! They have beautiful silverware and other things that are gorgeous hand made and shipped from Turkey. Alex is awesome, and Alihan's girlfriend who works there as manager  is so nice!  We dined there 4 times within 3 days we stayed in Pittsburgh , one day we had 2 dinners there ) and everything was consistently great!  Did I mention that the prices are very reasonable ? Dinner for two under $50 with drinks and dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal there tonight after the theater.   Used to love the Lemon Grass when I lived downtown and was sorry to see it go ( but found it on the Southside) .  Alihan's is a wonderful replacement. Food was terrific, tasty, properly seasoned, well prepared, nicely presented. The owner watched over everything and service was impeccable. Definitely on my list of places to go again !"}
{"text":"Very good food. Stopped by for lunch and had the lamb kofte and it was delicious and a very satisfying meal. 5 stars if there was something on the lettuce salad as a dressing of some sort would have added flavor. Otherwise I would highly recommend as a quick great lunch spot with great service."}
{"text":"We needed somewhere to eat before a Pirate game and this place seemed reasonably priced.  I'm a big fan of Mediterranean Food so I was so excited to try this.  We were seated right away on the outdoor patio.  I would definitely put in reservations if I would go again or wanted to sit inside.  The waitress was so sweet and answered all of our questions.  A frequent visitor of the restaurant was sitting next to us and struck up a conversation.  He said that Alihan's gets all their meat from Amish farmers.  I believe it because it was so wonderful and fresh.  I forget the exact name of the dish that I had, but it was the shaved lamb.  It was so flavorful! The tea was also very lovely and had a nice refreshing taste.  The waitress had asked someone to refill our water and they forgot.  The waitress profusely apologize and brought us some complementary baklava.  It was so flaky and soft and was absolutely wonderful.  I can't wait to visit this establishment again!!!"}
{"text":"Yummm!!! You knows it's going to be a good review when it started with Yum!  Went here for a family dinner during my first nights in Pittsburgh and glad we chose this place. I have not been to Istanbul but this place's decor and vibe seems to transport you to the ancient city.  We ordered baba ghanoush for appetizer. It came with a complimentary side of olive oil dip and some fresh bread. I liked the consistency of the eggplant dip (which our server told us they don't call baba ghanoush in Turkish. It has a different name but same dish. Baba ghanoush is the Arabic counterpart of the same dish). I did feel like the baba ghanoush at Istanbul Sofra was much more tastier though.  We ordered seafood ravioli with shrimp on top, lamb adana kabob and chicken sauté with lemon cream sauce. The kabob/chicken sauté came with rice. The food was delicious. I did not taste the ravioli but my brother loved it. We ended our delicious meal with Turkish tea which was presented in Turkish manner. Our server was a sweet lady who chatted with us regarding the making of tea. Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I am on my 8th week of eating healthy fresh meals since I am doing 12 week challenge. Not only their food is delicious but they are filling and healthy. I ordered  Chicken Shish kebab with Shepherd salad. I have been working 12 hours shift and did not have time to cook, so I have ordered food from here. I felt so good. Food was fresh, delicious, delivery service is prompt. Prices are reasonable. If you combine their meal and regular exercise, you will see results.  I highly recommend this place for dine in (beautiful atmosphere) and takeout orders. Thanks to Alihan's for saving me today  and helping to stay fit and healthy ?"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great value for lunch specials, and friendly, attentive staff. Don't skip the baklava!"}
{"text":"Nice Turkish restaurant with good ambience but problematic service. We have visited this restaurant on new year's evening. We ordered mixed kebab and Izmir Chupra (an Aegean fish) and Ayran for drink. I left one star out because our Ayran was not good! It was a little bit watery and no salt. I prepare better Ayran at home. Other than that our waiter brought us the wrong fish. We had to wait another 25 minutes for our fish. But then the owner arrived and we learned that Izmir Chupra is not frozen fish! It is shipped from Turkey via overnight shipping! It was amazing and it tastes fresh like the ones we eat in Izmir (I am from Izmir BTW). Owner also offered us Kunefe (a Turkish dessert origined in Southern Turkey) from the house. We will definitely visit here again and hopefully they will not have these issues again after reading our review :)"}
{"text":"Food was quite good but the service was so bad that our dining experience could be described as mediocre, at best.  It took us 5-6 minutes just to get menus after sitting down AND I had to ask for them. There were several servers who walked by our table but didn't notice we were empty handed. This happened again as a new party of 2 sat down next to us - also without menus - and the server was surprised they hadn't yet ordered when they asked for menus.  They also forgot to bring the appetizers to the party next to us and ignored their empty entree plates for way too long. All of this made me lower my expectations for my own experience. Thankfully our food came without issue - the chicken sauté and kebabs were both pretty good - but I had to remind for my Turkish tea (highly recommend) and water. The waiter also seemed surprised that he hadn't yet cleared our appetizer plates even though he had already brought our entrees. We ended with the baklava for dessert which was pretty tasty.  Throughout our entire meal, the hostess was on the phone taking takeout orders while the waiters were running around panicked. The staff here need more training, or the restaurant needs to be better staffed, especially on holidays."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The food portions were much larger than expected and we were comped a couple of small things because we waited patiently for a bit too long and they were understaffed.  The servers were very friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming despite being packed to the gills.  I had the Iskender Kebab and the stuffed grape leaves - the grape leaves were a little lacking in flavor but the kebab was deelish. My friend had the white bean salad and said it was a bit bland, like the beginning ingredients with which you later make a complete recipe.  All in all, I'd try it again."}
{"text":"I ordered the doner kebab entree and a side of hummus. Hummus tasted fresh and had authentic flavor to it. Was dissatisfied with the doner kebab. It was too oily for my liking. For dessert I went with the baklawa which was above average. I guess I'm comparing it to the Chicago baklawa quality which I am accustomed to. Location wise it is in a prime area and will always attract business. Next time if I'm there perhaps I'll try the chicken entrees."}
{"text":"Great food and great location.  Just in town for a business trip and was looking for someplace open later and found this gem."}
{"text":"Decided to try Alihan's on a Sunday before a Pirates game. Figured it was right near the Clemente bridge, so we could park for the game in one of the nearby garages. I also saw that they had a Sunday brunch and an extensive delicious-sounding menu.   We pulled into the garage around 11 am, which happened to be RIGHT next to Alihan's (and I think the closest garage in downtown to the Clemente bridge). How convenient!! AND, the event rate was $7! $7 for a garage close to PNC park?! Unbeatable!!!  We were a little skeptical walking into Alihan's - not one table was occupied. But we decided to proceed. Very nice inside - linen tablecloths and napkins. The front doors were wide open, and we briefly considered sitting on the front patio, but decided against it since it was starting to heat up quite a bit outside. They brought out menus, but I didn't see anything about a brunch menu, so I asked. The hostess was very apologetic, said she forgot it was Sunday, and brought some other brunch menus. We had some great coffees, and ordered a hummus app. It was a nice sized dish, accompanied by some really good Turkish bread. I ordered off the brunch menu - a cheese omelet, and my companion ordered off the regular menu - döner, which is basically gyro meat. After I saw his plate I knew I should have gone with something off their regular menu. It was a huge portion of perfectly charred lamb, with a nice side salad and a portion of bulgur. My omelet was perfectly fine, although somewhat generic, and came with a nice side of sliced tomatoes and cucumbers.  After stuffing ourselves, we sat and sipped coffee, watching the procession of fans walk by to the Pirate game since we were a bit early, and the waitress was very nice to let us sit and kept our coffees and waters filled. By a little after noon, a few other people had come in to dine. All in all, I have to say it was a PERFECTLY leisurely way to ensure getting to the ballgame on time, eat great food and drink great coffee beforehand, and get a bargain on close-in parking. Will DEFINITELY do this again on my next Sunday game!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We  had the charred eggplant as an appetizer.....pretty much Babaganouj. I had the lamb and beef meatballs which were tasty but a bit dry so we asked for some cucumber sauce, which added some moist flavor.  My friend had the lamb doner kebab. Although she really liked it, we didn't realize that it wasn't chunks of lamb, but rather formed meat.  The ayran and kadayif were great desserts. We'll definitely be back. Molly even gave us additional cucumber sauce to bring home."}
{"text":"My wife and I traveled to Pittsburgh to see a show. We like to take advantage of the entire evening so enjoying dinner in the city is a natural.  We had been to Alihan's one other time so we decided to try it again. They did not let us down. We made reservations earlier in the week with no problems. We got there a bit early and they got us right in. The staff was great. Very polite and helpful. We started with Turkish Tea and Calamari. My wife had the North Atlantic Salmon and I had the Lamb Chop Kebabs.  Everything was delicious. It was a great dinner and I would recommend Alihan's to all as a great Mediterranean dining experience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good service. Food is just okay not good or great. The best part of the meal was the bread and tapenade."}
{"text":"Very good food! Inside is beautiful. Very nice place for a romantic dinner with your loved one. Shared a dish full of all different types of meats and it was fantastic!! So much food"}
{"text":"I have dined here many times before a show.  I walk in thinking I am going to try something new but my favorite is the Eggplant Parmesan.  We also order the mixed cold appetizers and grilled veggies appetizers are the best!  All entrees come with complimentary glass of wine. The restaurant is BYOB but one glass is really all I need before a show!  The restaurant is very accomodating for food allergies. I do wish restaurants, in general, would have more dessert options for gluten intolerant individuals but their rice pudding is very good Service is friendly, sometimes very busy.  I have never had an issue with my meal.  I prefer to dine here than many of the other more \"trendy\" downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!   I discovered Alihan's while visiting Pittsburgh for work, and walking around downtown looking for a good lunch spot.   I love Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine, and this place caught my eye.  As I got closer to the entrance, there was a lunch menu posted which incuded 6 lunch specials for $10 each.  There are several meat options to include chicken, lamb, beef, there is also a vegetarian option.  I opted for the Chicken Shish which was accompanied with my choice of wheat bulgur, fries or rice.  I opted for the bulgur.  My choice of soft drink was also included in the special. There was a longer wait for the food than I anticipated, maybe 20 minutes, but once the food arrived, I determined it was well worth the wait.   My meal consisted of 3 large chunks of grilled, well seasoned chicken, placed between 2 halves of delicious flatbread, with a side of shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and grilled bell pepper strips.   There was a generous portion of wheat bulgur, which was positively yummy.  I didn't know what to expect, whether the side dish would be hot, cold, seasoned etc.  The dish was served warm with an assortment of veggies and seasoned nicely.   The bulgur was great accompaniment to the other components of the meal.   There was also a side of house made tzatiki sauce.    This was a very good meal and a great value for just $10.  I would definitely return for lunch and would also like to try the more expansive dinner menu, as well."}
{"text":"I have two favorite middle eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this is one of them. They are both tied for number one in my mind and I'm waiting for the day one takes the victory.  4 stars only because I love well made Pita bread, but hey that's okay. Turkish bread is cool with me.  This chef knows how to cook. I have dined in Cappadocia, Istanbul, Santorini, and Beirut. I have even dined middle eastern in NYC, most notably Queens, NYC.  This place is the bomb.  My god this chef got the flavors and cooking style totally down.  4 stars only because of consistency, and I look for it.  This restaurant is nicely situated downtown right before some bridge (four years abhi, four years and you still don't know your way around Pittsburgh. SMH).  Anyhow, great location, excellent interior for the size and space, and can actually be romantic. Dim the lights more maybe ton give it that flare (if they're looking for it).  The services was wonderful, and never needed a reservation to get a table (even outside on their little outdoor patio).  First up, of course, the way you test middle eastern food is akin to tasting who makes a good slice..taste their \"plain cheese pizza.\" In this case, it's the hummus.  God almighty it was wonderful. Perfect texture, the right blend of beans, herbs, and the right amount of garlic.  Great start. Next up, the bread with the hummus was a great treat. The tabbouleh was okay, a little TOO heavy on the parsley, but not bad.   Now for the feast.   I got the grilled meat platter and devoured it whole. All the meats were cooked to perfection, the vegetables had the right amount of char and smoke to them, and the lamb was succulent and juicy. The chicken as perfect, and I LOVE Adana kababs and Tawook, and man this guy knows how to marinade meat. My friend doesn't eat red meat so he got the melt in your mouth sea bass..and it proceeded to fall apart like Atlantis in my mouth.   This is a great place to dine in and take out. In fact, it's the perfect post work out meal. A healthy grilled dose of protein with some wheat bulgur (or rice) with a salad...it's perfect!  The wheat bulgur is cooked very well and accompanies every dish. The rice is seasoned and has a great texture.  Love this place, and will continue to come back. Very reasonably priced and awesome value for your buck.  Hate that I was greeted with a \"someone was giving reviews from the same IP address.\"  Won't lie though, they are that good!."}
{"text":"We always eat here when we attend shows at the Byham. Then we always say we should eat her more often. We have never had a bad meal and service is always very good.  With my wife I shared the kebabs for two @$30. The portions were very very generous. In fact I'm looking forward to my lunch tomorrow. I will gladly save room for dessert because the desert here is fantastic. It's like baklava but they serve it with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. It's just right to share with a loved one."}
{"text":"We came here at least once whenever visiting Pittsburgh. Lamb and cream caramel here are all amazing. Reasonable price"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! The ambiance and attention detail in every way is unmatched in the city. The food is fresh and the meat is clean! The staff is very hospitable and knowledgeable! Out of all the restaurants in the city, we always find ourselves coming here. 5 stars aren't enough to give !"}
{"text":"This place deserves a 5 star. Why it didn't get it? Service:  1. The place is BYOB, why the fuss over asking for a wine bucket? We needed two. Seemed like they were shocked that we asked. They only had two. Really? Then pretty much had to ice them up myself. 2. Added a $5.00 BYOB charge to the bill. Really?? 3. Said they didn't have enough silverware to give us clean ones after the appetizers. Really??? We were the only ones in the place!   Why it should have gotten 5 stars? Service:  1. After the initial debacle, the service was EXTREMELY attentive but not fake or annoying.  Food: 1. Appetizer cold plate was YUM! Especially the eggplant, dolmeh and tabouleh. Fried calamari, meh, tasted frozen, (I live on the coast and am used to the fresh stuff so I'm not going to be overly critical here). 2. Entrees: a. Several had chicken kabob and said they were outstanding, including cuz. b. Couple had lamb chops and said they were outstanding (including brother in law from Iran). c. Couple had shrimp, said they were tasty. d. Uncle, (from Afghanistan), had lamb kabob and I also ordered a side skewer. Medium rare perfection!!!  e. My main entree was a grilled whole dorado, OMG especially when eaten with the crispy skin! Rice was tasty too! f. Mom had eggplant parmesan and said it was too spicy. Hey it's a mediterranean restaurant, what do you expect?  Price: 1. Brunch with huge portions plus add ons for 11 people and just under $300.00? That's what Um talkin' 'bout!  Originally a Bloomfield homey, I was glad to be in downtown Pittsburgh after not having been in about 15 years!"}
{"text":"Alihans gets some of the best and interesting servers. Had Emin last night and his service was excellent and always with a smile. Food again was good. Excellent bread. Pretty restaurant and BYOB."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing and vegan friendly place. We took two salads (Mediterranean and white beans salad), chobra soup, dolma and ayran for drinks. Food is delicious and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Had to visit twice before I could put in a review just to make sure. Food was delicious each time. I recommend the Chef Borek as a small appetizer. You can tell it is home made and the flavor is outstanding. My entree is called \"iskender kebab\" but it isn't served on a kebab at all, but in a skillet over chucks of buttery bread that resembles home fries. Some of the best lamb I have had in a while. Only downside to this place is it is BYOB. I grabbed a six pack accross the street but will bring my own Cabernet next time!  First time I have ever had traditional baklava. Not your normal baklava. Trust me, you have never had this type before! Very good!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not. When i called to make the reservation. I had a lot of dead air on the phone. thought i was disconnected, so said hello? She snapped at me, I'm Counting!!! .Appetizer  never arrived, had to ask after it, but by that time already had entree...so i sent it back when it finally came. Waiter disappeared. Hostess had to pick up the slack. Never  came to ask if dinner  was ok. Had to ask for beverage refills. Not big  deals but continual. When check came app was still on it. The sign in the ladies said please yelp, so...but at 915 they were calling me, I was in the theater. thanks alihans, nice touch. should have paid that much attention to me while i was there."}
{"text":"Wonderful Persian Turkish food.  Large portions.  The Mezze platter gave taste of all the cold appetizers, which were flavorful and fresh.  The Chef Borek was very flaky. Mixed Kebab was a huge platter, that had chicken lamb and beef kebabs, doner and kofte.  Definitely get half and half bulgur and basmati rice, and don't forget the butter!  Even the baklava was great and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean place in the 'burgh! Believe me I have tried most of the Mediterranean places in Pittsburgh and no one comes close to Alihan! My husband is a sucker for a good good Mediterranean place him and I would do anything to find a good kebab place because we love our kebabs more than our abs! Hahahaha! But on a serious note if you're in 'burgh and hunting down for a good place to eat and amazing service look no further alihan is your spot! Try their mixed platter two people can easily share that it comes with all the kebabs in their menu.. full of flavor,tender, juicy,moist all the things one would want for their meat to be! Love it!"}
{"text":"This review is very overdue, but my family and I went while vacationing in Pittsburgh ..the staff was incredible. The food was beyond incredible. Dining here was an amazing experience and I wi go back if ever back in Pitt"}
{"text":"If you're looking for somewhere to go before an event downtown- try Alihan's.   It's right across the street from the Byham, so it's the perfect spot for a great meal before an event at the Cultural Trust.   Heads up! It's BYOB!! Don't forget your bottle or two of wine! And make a reservation! Although you can walk in too.   To start, we ordered the eggplant baba ganoush. It comes with pita bread. It's simply delicious.    While you wait for your meal - they bring you Turkish bread and oil to dip it in. The waitstaff is super friendly and helpful when your ordering.   For my meal, I ordered the chicken kebabs. They come over rice and a side salad. The chicken kebabs are a generous portion and great pieces of meat. The rice is very tasty as well. I usually don't eat the salad because I want to eat all my meat and rice.   My mom ordered the lamb kebabs- same deal as the the chicken. She enjoyed her meal as well.    We will back to Alihan's again soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped here prior to Pitt football game.  What a wonderful place.  The Turkish bread provided with a walnut oil dip was simply perfect. A mix of crispness and softness at the same time. My wife had toboulleh and lentil soup.  A perfect combination of flavors.  I had the lamb kebabs and never tasted lamb so tender.  Ended the meal with Turkish coffee and baklava. One of the best places we have eaten in a long time."}
{"text":"Amazed at how delicious the food tastes! Service was great. Will definitely be returning to sample more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and have walked past Alihans many of times. There always seems to be a lot of people eating inside and in the summer you can sit outside too! What is nice about this restaurant is its location. It's attached to the Fort Duquesne and 6th Street garage and The Byham Theatre is right a cross the street. I believe that parking is $7 after 4 o'clock.   I made reservations through Yelp for my parents and I for a Friday night. When we arrived around 4, I looked around and noticed practically all of the tables had reserved signs on them. I was relieved to have had those reservations.   From 11 am - 11 pm they offer complementary wine (a red that can't remember the name of and Chardonnay). My dad picked the red and my mom and I went with Chardonnay. They did run out of the Chardonnay so we had to wait until someone went to buy more. They are not skimpy drinks by any means. Half the glass was filled and I will say it was a very good Chardonnay!   Our waitress brought out Turkish bread and a dipping oil that had an olive tapenade in it. We really enjoyed this! For our meals I ordered the doner kabab ($14), my mom ordered the chicken shish kabab ($16), and my dad ordered the chicken saute ($16). For our sides we all went with rice. I will say they did give you a lot of food for the price. When I'm eating at ethnic restaurants I really find it helpful when the menu items have descriptions. If there isn't a picture to show me what the dish looks like, I like reading all that is in it at least and Alihan's didn't fail to deliver that to me.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for years and never stopped here until a client suggested it for lunch one day..I've been hooked ever since. Great lunch deals, huge portions and excellent quality. The hummus is my favorite downtown and the Turkish bread they give you with it is much better than pita. The staff is very friendly and is always pleasant even though I typically get takeout. If you have a few moments to wait, I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Nice place near Theater District.   Turkish cuisine.   Hummus was very good and the grape leaves were VERY tasty.     The bread is excellent for the hummus as well as the crushed olive dips.   We also had the chicken kebab with salad, rice and Bulger wheat and also the lamb and beef kebab with same sides.  BYOB but if you forget or we're just too busy to pick up they offer complimentary Chardonnay or Chianti for you enjoyment.    Finished with a Turkish tea and skipped desert.   Reservation recommended especially if shows in town."}
{"text":"One of the best BYOB options downtown! I've eaten in and had take-out here multiple times and the food is always great. They have great $10 lunch specials, from 11am-2pm Monday to Friday, which come with a choice of meat, French fries, rice or wheat bulgar, a drink and a side salad. I've had the kafta, chicken shish and lamb gyro and was very happy with all of them. I usually can't leave without a piece of baklava either! The staff has always been very friendly and attentive.   This place is right in the heart of the cultural district, so if you are planning a pre-show dinner here, I'd recommend reservations, but I have never had trouble walking in for lunch."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through Yelp for a same day dinner (it was a Saturday) and they responded right away - it was very easy.  Don't let the BYO fool you - the atmosphere inside is upscale. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and service was prompt. It's a great place for dinner before a show.  We started with the chef borek, stuffed grape leaves, and hummus. The borek is delicious - do not miss it! Obviously fried cheese in dough is going to be delicious, but the sauce really takes it to the next level. The grape leaves were good, but I was neither here nor there on the hummus (but I am super picky).  For my main dish I got the falafel. Initially I balked at the $17 price tag - usually being a vegetarian means I eat cheap. But when the dish arrived it was clear that it was worth the price. The falafel patties are quite large, and you get 5 of them, all on a giant salad.  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranean and Turkish cuisine right downtown.  Alihan is also one of the few restaurants that don't close their kitchen 30-40 minutes before posted closing signs.  The servers were friendly.  The restaurant is well-lit with white table cloth.  It's a great place to head out for a good dinner.  We got the chicken soup, the lamb shish kebab, and the iskender kebab.  All of them were outstanding.  The chicken soup has so much vegetable and meat, a bit too salty for me, but very warming.  I'd come get some if I ever feel under the weather.  The lamb shish kebab comes with standard turkish rice and salad.  The lamb was very juicy.  I preferred it over the lamb gyro on the iskender kebab.  Although the lamb gyro was more dry on the iskender kebab, the whole dish was drenched with tomato sauce.  The flavor was phenomenon.  The tangy yogurt on top help balance out the tomato sauce.  Great portion size, delicious taste - I'll be coming around more!"}
{"text":"Very good service. The hummus was AMAZING, and served with homemade bread. I considered eating them out of that bread, but the portions were so large I didn't think my stomach could handle it. I got the chicken kabob, the salad that came with it had grilled peppers (nice touch) and wonderful rice. Chicken was well seasoned."}
{"text":"Fantastic Turkish food! Order Iskender Kebab with Ayran to drink. Then have Kunefe and Turkish tea for dessert."}
{"text":"Tried the aryan it wasn't particularly my cup of tea. Tried the kebabs tho and they where absolutely delicious. The islander is something takes to develop a taste but even so the food is wonderful all in all."}
{"text":"I found this place on a whim and I was not disappointed. The service was friendly, the price was fair and the Lamb Meatballs were tasty. Not a bad place to stop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Whenever my friends and I visit the Cultural District to see a show, there are two questions that are first and foremost in my mind: (1) Are we going to have dinner beforehand? (2) If so, where?  As the resident foodie, the task often falls to me to recommend places and convince my friends to try somewhere more novel than Chipotle or Noodles & Co., even if it's a bit more expensive and takes a bit longer.  I always look for places that are (1) well-reviewed, (2) novel, and (3) within our budget (i.e., $-$$).  Alihan's fit all of those constraints, so I came here with two friends for dinner yesterday before seeing a PSO concert at Heinz Hall up the street.   Having reviewed the reviews beforehand, I knew Alihan's was known for their kunefe dessert, so I suggested that we try it, and my friends agreed.  (Note: I rarely order dessert at normal restaurants unless something really piques my interest, since I tend to prefer heading to an ice cream parlor instead.)  Since we were on a somewhat constrained schedule, we ordered the dessert at the same time that we ordered our entrees, which worked out well.  Spoiler alert: The dessert was as great as everyone claimed!  I'd never had kunefe before, but my friends had and they agreed it was good.  I loved the sweet/salty and crunchy/chewy combinations that it contained--it reminded me of shredded wheat with cheese and syrup! If you haven't ever tried this unique and tasty dessert, Alihan's is a great place to do so!  For entrees, one friend and I ordered the chicken adana kebob, and my other friend ordered the kofte (meatball) kebob, since Alihan's seems to specialize in kebobs.   According to my one friend who tried both, they were both very good and tasted very different.  (I can only speak for the chicken kebob, since I don't eat red meat.)  The chicken kebob was well-seasoned and savory but not spicy.  I'm guessing it was toned down to adapt to the local palate, since it usually has some heat to it, but I was okay with that since I tolerate spicy food but don't seek it out.  Both dishes came with a side of rice or bulgur, so we ordered the latter, and it was also well-seasoned.  The grilled vegetables were less impressive, but I did like the sauce (lemon vinaigrette?) that they were dressed with.  Portions were quite large, to the point that all of us left some food on our plates (we couldn't take leftovers with us because we were attending a show afterwards, but otherwise, we would have!).  Aside from the food, we enjoyed the ambiance, which is more upscale-ish for a moderately priced restaurant (though I'm not sure how I feel about the paper covering the table linens...).  Service was very efficient and professional, which we appreciated given our time constraints.  The Greek restaurant next door would do well to take a page out of their book re: the food, service, and ambiance.  Based on our experience, I'd definitely recommend Alihan's for dinner before a show in the Cultural District, if you're looking for a place to eat downtown!"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh on a business trip and stumbled upon this gem. The sea bass is delicious!!! Very soft and tender. The house sauce compliments the fish very well. Price of sea bass is affordable. Customer service is amazing! Will miss this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful starters with bright flavorful Baba and Hummus served with warm homemade bread. The kebabs rocked!"}
{"text":"The service was great and it's a definite step up from the Mediterranean places also in this corridor. The food was decent but, with some really good more family style places cropping up (read: delicious and cheaper), seems like the food should rise the upscaleness of the place. Menu is huge, which also concerns and confuses me."}
{"text":"Interesting little restaurant downtown right near the similar cuisine of Christo's. This place makes excellent food, however.  The chicken shish kebab is absolutely wonderful. Dorado is also quite well-done as well.  They serve a wonderful homemade sort of pita bread served with olive oil and crush olives.    When we went, they unfortunately did not have some of the traditional turkish-style desserts so we will definitely have to go back. Turkish coffee is supposedly quite good from dining companions.  Some limitations of the place are the somewhat odd-ambience. Outside it's lively and busy, but the restaurant itself was somewhat dead on a weekend night. Surprising considering the quality of the food, which was excellent. Would definitely recommend. Reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are for the awkward, cheap use of paper table coverings over white tablecloth and slightly sluggish service. Quiet atmosphere and great food are enough to make up for these limitations, however."}
{"text":"We checked this place out on a whim after I happened to notice that they deliver. It's tough to find a healthy option for delivery around here and my go to Chinese place was already closed for the evening, so this is a pretty big deal. Alihan's did not disappoint!   The gentleman that answered the phone was friendly, as was the delivery driver. We tried the mixed kebab dinner and the white bean salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The lamb chop kebab was especially good, I'll get the full order for my meal next time! I loved the wheat bulger, my husband was a fan of the white rice. We both agreed that the bread was fantastic. Overall, I'm impressed and we'll definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here with my boyfriend last night. We have been to many of the Mediterranean restaurants in and around Pittsburgh, by far this restaurant is the worst one. We ordered lamb kofte. Only the outside was cooked and the inside was raw and cold. The rice and the salad that came with it were bland with no flavor at all. We will never be back."}
{"text":"It was the first time in USA when I ate soup and felt an amazing, rich flavor of the soup and not the salt. In other words - it was the best soup I ever ate here. Salads are also very impressive and fresh.  Desert menu have a lot of egg-free options and in general place is very vegan friendly."}
{"text":"Fancy for not fancy prices. Only One vegetarian dish. Classy atmosphere. No falafel :("}
{"text":"This placed looked really cool because it had columns on the outside. We went in for lunch and were able to find a seat. Everything on the kids menu was $10, so I got my kids an adult entree to share, it was the shrimp ravioli, which they ate but weren't big fans of. They did like the hummus. I ordered the vegetarian saute, which was good, the portion was small, but they also served it with rice and bread. I wasn't a big fan of the rice. My husband had the lamb, which he said was dry. The ambiance was nice because we had a breeze coming in so for a minute you felt like you could have been somewhere else."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This place isn't amazing. Although they were quite accommodating to our large group, Alihan's isn't the best place. It's okay.  The hummus and pita are probably the best things here, in addition to the Turkish coffee.  I ordered the cold appetizer platter, charred eggplant, and shepherd salad. I enjoyed the appetizer platter. It comes with hummus, tabouleh, eggplant, wrapped grape leaves, and a few other insignificant things (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sauce, etc.).   Don't order the shepherd salad. It's just a bunch of chopped cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes. I was disappointed. The charred eggplant was simply a below-average dip. Perhaps restaurants need to put down in what form or style the food comes in.  The waitresses are nice. They are all easy on the eyes, too."}
{"text":"Alihan's Mediterranean Cuisine did such a fabulous job for our family Saturday for my mom's 90th surprise birthday party.  The food was OUTSTANDING and the platters kept coming.  Alihan, Martina and the entire staff made this celebration a day our family will never forget.  Kudos to a wonderful, professional and gracious owner and staff.  We will continue to tell everyone about the most wonderful atmosphere provided at this venue.  Thank you from all of us for making my mom's birthday, a day she will always hold dear."}
{"text":"Alihan's is a great restaurant, full of authentic Mediterranean flavors and nice people. We came here on Christmas Day and they were opened! I ordered a Döner kebab with rice. The portions were huge. I could not finish all the food. Our server was fantastic, respectful, and very attentive. The restaurant offers a huge array of tastes, from Italy to Middle Eastern delicacies. I definitely recommend this place. Check their website for a free Turkish bread and hummus appetizer. Blessings!"}
{"text":"We love Alihan's! We have been here at least half a dozen times and we love bringing friends and family here.  The service here has always been good. All of our guests that we have taken love it too!  We usually get one of the kebab plates and some appetizers. My SO really likes the lamb Adana.   They are BYOB, so make sure you bring wine, they also will give you a glass of wine with each entree ordered!   It isn't cheap, but the prices are reasonable! Great place to get food when you are doing something downtown."}
{"text":"Attended a private anniversary party here last week. First it was awesome that the party had the whole restaurant to themselves.  The appetizers, calamari, grapeleaves and hummus were hard to stop munching on and my entree the seafood ravioli was quite tasty also. The party's organizers complimented the staff several times in their speeches. I would like to come back again some other time and try something else."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The food was authentic and the service was great. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'll certainly stop in again. The hummus and stuffed grape leaves were great. The lamb was a little over cooked (I ordered medium got medium well) but very well seasoned. Great place."}
{"text":"We love Alihan's! It's a super affordable yet nice date night dinner. Especially before a show!  Getting a free glass of wine tops it all off and you can go BYOB too!  Their portions are large and everything is very good. The baba is fantastic as are all the grilled meats.   One of my favorite Turkish/Mediterranean places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"On the way to a Pirates game, my family and I stopped here for dinner. It's located downtown in the cultural district and is literally a 7-minute walk to the PNC Park. We came early around 5:45 and were seated right away. The Turkish bread was delicious, I had to force myself to only eat two to save room for dinner. I definitely recommend the hummus-it's homemade. I had the lamb adana with half rice pilaf and half bulgar rice (both were tasty). The lamb adana was seasoned well (they give you two long strips) and their tzatziki yogurt sauce was perfect (light and more stiff). The plate also comes with salad; I couldn't even finish! Great prices and generous amount of food! Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"It was fine, but nothing special. Was expecting something better from the reviews. It's  not straight Mediterranean but mixed with Italian, although some would consider that Mediterranean too.  Sat outside and people stopped on the streets to talk to each other right over us and it seem to go on FOREVER. If we knew, we would have sat inside."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last thursday - damn Ali, you know how to make good cheap grub!  The lunch specials here during the week are amazing, you have to take advantage.  Service was great, and so was my gyro platter.  You're not gonna find a better sit-down lunch for two for under $25 anywhere!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. Good meal portions - satisfying but not overwhelming (we didn't want to have to take leftovers since we were going to Heinz Hall after), and awesome that it was BYOB! ($5 cork fee per bottle/6 pack)."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  We love Middle Eastern food and this was terrific.  The service was great We ordered the cold appetizer platter.  All the salad we great but we ended up dueling forks over the baba and the tabuli.  The Chef borek was fabu. I would eat this regularly if I lived in Pittsburgh.  My hubby order lamb adana with Bulger pilaf.  He was really, really happy.  I got a Mediterranean salad which was also yummy.  Note: the entrees are HUGE.  We should have shared one. A nice perk is a free glass of wine with dinner unless you bring your own  The restaurant is at the base of the bridge that leads to the stadium which is really handy."}
{"text":"Woah baby was this unexpectedly really good! Came in for lunch with a coworker. First off I need to talk about this salad that this lady next to me had. I didn't get it because I wasn't in the mood for a salad BUT IT WAS HUGE AND LOOKED AMAZING. So try the salads haha.   Anyway, I ordered lamb Adana kebab and my coworker ordered off the lunch menu. We also split hummus for an app. The hummus was incredible. I've been thinking about it ever since. My kebab and wheat bulgar were also amazing.  Our server was very nice, but a little too busy and we had to wait to get his attention a few times.   But other than that I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, easy to get reservation, great food. Went with 6 friends. Everyone loved their dishes. Appetizers were very good too. Would come back. Decent amount of people on a Monday night. BYOB and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is the worse food we ever had Falafel is hard like a rock and Taste like dried fried wheet sauce is nasty, Hot tea is garbage. Hummus is nasty baba ganouj is nasty And on top of it the blond  host is ignorant  And waitress that looks chines is rude also  We had the worse meal  And I don't believe this restaurant is Mediterranean  The taste of the food is nothing Mediterranean   I believe this restaurant won't take Ming to shut down  And prices is expensive  Only the Greek salad was good  We had to send back most of food You serving Tea as a Turkish Tea where infact it's Tea bags with boiled water over and over it was very nasty And ur falafel was like a rock  And I never knew falafel is offerd with Gyro sauce  I shouldn't even wrote this stuff since you guys are so Rude  What I wrote helps u  But u took it as am putting u down I had lots of Mediterranean food and this for sure was theee worse ?"}
{"text":"Fantastic variety. Had the Iskender Kebab, which was so rich along with the yogurt. Hard to finish! Great service as well."}
{"text":"I went to Alihan's twice today, once for lunch and again for dinner. While their food is great, I think their service is a bit lacking. The waitresses are not quick to fill up your water, don't let you know that your lunch meal actually comes with a soda, and don't hold the door for you even though one employee is standing by the front entrance attempting to draw in customers. Another thing that bothered me is that I feel their portions are a little small."}
{"text":"Wow..! Just finished eating and man, that was awesome - praise the Lord!  PROS: - Nice decor - Light soothing guitar music - Well uniformed waiters - Good recommendation by Sameet (?) sorry if I messes up the name - Chicken Sheesh Kabab and Adona Chicken - Chicken was juicy and tasty - Even the salad was tasty - Oil and fresh bread was very nice - Food was just generally made with love! You can tell! Thumbs up for the chef!  Truly a great experience!  CONS: - We don't have a branch in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I came here one day for a sit down lunch with some coworkers after a friend recommended this place to me. I sadly was not as impressed as she was. I went with the chicken shish lunch special and everything about it was just ok. The chicken seemed extremely dry and rather tasteless. I would eventually like to go back for dinner and give it another chance. I think they definitely have some great menu options and what's not to like about a complimentary glass of wine?!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing - easily my favorite Mediterranean place in Pittsburgh. They have very large portions, great service and the atmosphere is wonderful. This is a great place to go to on a date because you can take a nice stroll through the cultural district where there are fun bars and other restaurants as well (if you're in the more for even more food).   My favorite dishes = Chef Borek, lamb adana kebab and lamb shish kebab"}
{"text":"In town for business and needed to eat.   Location-great location in Downtown.   Service-guys were great and well educated on food.   Food-Fantastic! Hummus was very tasty and dish was great!   Dessert-rice pudding was amazing. Light and super tasty, sweet tooth taken care of.   I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean place! Food was out super fast and reasonable prices! The lamb was amazing and delicious"}
{"text":"Yes.  Yes.  And Yes.  5 stars.  My dad, who lives in Missouri, said that the next time that he was in town that he wanted to have real Mediterranean food.  He and my mom were here over the weekend so we took them to Alihan's.  We went for lunch on Sunday.  There weren't very many patrons but I think it's because everyone was headed to the Pirate game.   My husband and I ordered Mixed Kabobs.  It has all of their meat and chicken choices for two people to share.  Needless to say that the platter was huge!!  I think we might have drooled a little.  It was definitely filled with meats along with two types of rice and side salads.  You almost didn't know where to start.  I started with the chicken and went from there.  Each meat was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly.  I couldn't stop eating the white rice and my husband chowed on the other reddish rice.  I'm not a big fan of rice but for some reason I loved this rice.  The salad gave you a nice crunch to go along with your meal.  I couldn't pick a favorite meat because they all had such different flavors.  We got my son's girlfriend to try lamb.  She is a majorly picky eater but really enjoyed the lamb.  That speaks volumes.   My mom had the Eggplant Parmesan.  I snuck a taste before she took her first bite.  WOW!  The eggplant isn't fried at all like it usually is at other places.  There were nice bites of mozzarella layered in as it was built almost like a lasagna.  The sauce was incredible.  It was very flavorful but not overpowering.  I thought my mom was going to actually lick the plate which is very unlike her.   My dad had the Shrimp and Seafood Ravioli.  I didn't taste the shrimp but I had one of the ravioli.  They are pillows of goodness covered in a rich creamy white sauce.  It is probably one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had.  Despite the heaping amount of food in one bite it still seemed light.  I actually wanted to take some of the sauce from my mom's dish and some from my dad's and mix them.  I think it would have made a third delicious sauce.   Our service was on point.  My parents LOVED their food.  They said it was one of the best meals that they have had.  I can't wait to take others there to try it."}
{"text":"Pathetic experience. Food was tasteless and undercooked. Lamb wasn't tender. Service was bad."}
{"text":"The mixed cold appetizer was a yummy explosion that delighted my taste buds!  The atmosphere was beautiful, classy and relaxing.  Everyone from the wait staff to the owner, Alihan, were charming and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian options. Had the red lentils soup and the white bean salad and both were very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Located in the theatre district Alihan's is easily accessible since there is a parking garage located right by the entrance. We came in a Saturday night without a reservation and luckily were able to get a table. I would not recommend going without a reservation because the place is very tiny, we just got lucky like I said. It was much more of an upscale restaurant than I had envisioned with cloth tablecloths and napkins. I saw at least 2 tables that brought their own wine, personal note made for next visit. We started off with a hi mmus appetizer because we both love hummus. It came with an when style bread and you could definitely tell it was freshly made. Delicious. Same goes for the entrees, the Lamb Shish Kebabs and the Chicken Köfte. Both came with your choice of rice or bulgar, and both dishes were just the perfect Mediterranean blend if seasonings on perfectly cooked meats. We didn't have room for dessert this time but I definitely want to try their rice pudding, baklava or kadayif!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome! My grandmother has been bugging me to take her to Alihans for months and we finally got here and everything is delicious. I chose the chicken soup and it tasted like my great-grandmothers (who raised and butchered her own chickens), and used the lemon on the side to freshen. My main course was the chicken shish kabob and the meat was tender and tasty, the rice was buttery and perfectly cooked and the side salad was fresh and crisp. Their homemade Turkish bread was some of the best I've ever had. My sister cleaned her plate with the sea bass and my grandmother spoke highly of the lamb shish kebob. They have such a diverse menu it was hard to choose a main dish, but Daria was such a pleasant and knowledgeable server, she was able to answer questions and suggest plates. We will be back several times to work our way through the menu."}
{"text":"Overall I like the place. I do take out very often and the food is decent. I just don't recommend lamb as I feed it smells a little. The shrimp sautee is very good, although it's not really Turkish food."}
{"text":"Went with friends after a pleasant day kayaking. Overall: 4/5. Details below.  *Decor: 5/5* the aesthetic is nice. Jeweled art around the room, unique shaped lights hanging from the ceiling, and outdoor seating. Chairs outside were a bit weirdly shaped for seating. *Music: N/A* Only the sounds of the city reverberate into the restaurant amongst the chatter. *Food presentation: 4/5* Hummus was cute. The calamari was a basic design, surrounding the sauce. LARGE plates, proportionate to their cost. The mixed kebab is an assortment of well placed meats and vegetables with the rice in the middle and vegetables in the corners. Was nice placement, but it felt like there could've been a better design.   *Flavor: 4.8/5* Hummus and calamari tasted quite fresh. Calamari was soft and easy to chew while the hummus came in a gracious amount.Rice and salad was lightly flavored...ideal for the spiced and flavored variety of meats. Some meats were a bit tougher than others, some were grilled to a light char, and others were right on point in texture. My friends were less keen on the tougher meats, but I enjoyed them. *Price: 4.8/5* Our meal ended up about 22 dollars per person. It felt pretty fair for the type of restaurant while getting an the calamari and hummus appetizers. The appetizers were DEFINITELY worth it. *Service: 4/5* The service was quite friendly, though it seems we were misunderstood at times. It felt mediocre overall, but was easy going when dealing with how to split the payment. *Bathrooms: 3.5/5* It's a small, single person bathroom. I think it was pretty well decorated. It even has a bidet! It's a bit dimly lit and the room was a little moist. There was condensation on top of the facilities, so it felt weird to flush.  Would I come back again? Maybe. Probably not. It was pleasant, a little more expensive than what I'd hope for, but overall a good experience once.  Final thoughts: I was glad to experience the food, but I feel there are better Mediterranean restaurants out there for better prices. I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Ali Hans was recommended to us by our Turkish Uber driver. It really measured up. Great service throughout the evening .  My wife had their chicken kabab and I had the Lamb sauté. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Showed up without a reservation. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Server Tess our server was incredible and made the experience. Had the lamb kabobs which were delicious. All was amazing and would recommend!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch less than a month ago and was very satisfied with the food and service. There is only one thing I would change. It's the size of portions. If they were a little bit smaller, then I would be able to eat a dessert."}
{"text":"Great food, but my friend and I both thought the portion sizes were a tad small. They also do not have an open bar or serve alcohol, but it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Right on 6th, across from the Marriott Renaissance Hotel.  The place is nice, classic european efficiency.   white linen tables , water feature as you enter, nice place.  The patio was all utilitarian, metal table and chairs, like being in a different place, like many euro places I've been to.  so you could choose how \"formal\" you wanted to be.   The menu is extensive, a nice mix of Turkish, italian influenced , fresh fish etc..... i settled on the grilled eggplant appetizer, a Caprice salad with Lamb Gyros, and the Knefe, with turkish tea for desert.   the staff was nice, relaxed,  and there if you needed them.  Take your time, enjoy what Alihan's has to offer. Good food, ambiance, and staff."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here and will be back as soon as we can. The service  was good and the food was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. He answered several questions and made recommendations based on what we said we liked. His suggestions were spot on. We ate here before attending a show and they kept my leftovers in their refrigerator for me until after the show. They are centrally located right under a parking garage and make it so easy to get in and out. The food was delicious and plentiful. Get some baklava to eat at home too!"}
{"text":"Nice and very delicious food. Great Service and very clean. Best place for Lunch in downtown"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the Theater district.    Parking about 1 block away from all the theaters.  Call early and get window seats for the walk by view.  This is the truly authentic Greek place in Pittsburgh.  We are going to go much earlier next time and get a window or outside seat just to enjoy the ambiance... okay ... after the humidity is down a bit.  But a kick back, look around, enjoy type of place.  So Greek and European...  The US simply does not understand this vibe of evening relaxation with others.  BYOB -- yes, but they also serve home made wine there as well.  Food is just fine ...  If you want to understand the place a bit, look at the staff and the artifacts in the displays.... This is authentic Greek in service, style, and ambiance.   Having been to Greece before, I sorta know the vibe ... welcoming, embracing, and \"large.\"     The place is a bit cramped, but what does one expect if you are at the base of the Parthenon at 11 PM and people are dancing and breaking plates?    I would call early for preferred places and reservations.    Roy"}
{"text":"Excellent find in the steel city!   Get the cold appetizer platter.   Excellent variety and the eggplant and grape leaves were terrific.   Their Lamb Adana Kebab was so much juicier than other Kababs I've had."}
{"text":"Food was very authentic and the pace was very middle eastern. Great way to relax after a long day at work, loved the patio seating!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for all counts! Kofle, babaganoush, falafel, baklava and turkish coffee all blew my mind. Though I didn't leave yet I already thinking of coming back."}
{"text":"A delicious break from the ordinary. Family run with great food. Definately will be returning to try everything else on the menu. Lamb saute was Devine for that night and the next day. The deserts are a must. Very lovingly prepared. Small place but very comfy. Parking right next door, if not on the street."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening. Started with the hummus and an order of chef borek. Amazing! Tasty, perfectly done crust ... reminded me of a huge step up from spinach pie. We brought our wine with us and the waiter, though apparently somewhat confused, uncorked and brought us glasses. Then my friend ordered the falafel and I ordered the lamb Adana kabob. The waiter asked me \" are you sure you want to order that?\" I asked if there's something wrong with it. Again, confused, he said that he thought I'd ordered something else. Somewhat disconcerting, I thought. Both dishes were delicious. Falafel done perfectly, my lamb tasty and just enough spice to it. Finished up with baklava and Turkish tea. Yummy!! We will certainly come here again. Would have definitely given it a 5 except for the waiter."}
{"text":"You can get a great meal at Alihan's for about 1/2 the price of many of the other sit-down restaurants in the theater area. The eggplant parm with salad for $16, which also includes a glass of wine, is unbeatable and the appetizers are uniformly great.   Consistently good food and service.  Alihan's still has a Manhattan feel to it."}
{"text":"The service here is great and the food is amazing. We came here at mid day and were promptly attended to. The menu offers many options which can be switched and the flavors are divine.   I ordered the chicken shish kebab. The rice had great flavor with coconut milk and all the other wonderful spices.  The shish kebabs were cooked to perfection and had the right mix of flavor and spice. I will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful family-run restaurant with exceptional middle eastern food. I have yet to be disappointed with any vegetarian options, and my omnivore companions always like their dishes as well. Perfect before a show in the cultural district or anytime."}
{"text":"First time trying sea bass (whole fish) and it was great! I was hesitant to eat whole fish because of my fear of fish bones, but I was able to eat around it. The sea bass is tender and is paired with some spice sauce. Not sure exactly what the sauce was, but it was excellent. It comes with a pile of veggies. The veggies only taste okay, but since its not the main attraction of the dish, I will let that slide. I had a side of rice and the seasoning they used made the rice richer in flavor.  I would definitely recommend the sea bass dish. Its very flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"I had an interesting experience here one night before the symphony.  My mother and I had a restaurant.com gift certificate and we chose the restaurant based on its close proximity to Heinz Hall.   We noticed a sign on the way in that offered a free glass of wine with an entree (we were pumped!), but we didn't realize that they didn't have a liquor license and they were BYOB, so we were quickly saddened after our first glasses were gone.  The rest of the evening would also hold a few more disappointments for us.  We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night, and they told us that they were already out of all their beef and filet mignon options (bummer!).  In addition, my mom ordered the salmon seafood ravioli and they brought her the shrimp seafood ravioli (however, not the end of the world).  The waitress was really great about it and brought out a piece of salmon for my mom to add to her pasta, but the salmon wasn't cooked all the way through and was actually cold in the middle.  On the bright side, the food tasted great! I ordered the calamari to start and the chicken shish kabob for my entree.  Both were excellent and very filling! My mom also still really enjoyed her shrimp/undercooked salmon ravioli.  The highlights of the evening were by far, however, our dessert (the Kunefe) and our waitress.  The dessert was unlike anything I've tried before (in a very good way), and our waitress was extremely accommodating and professional in dealing with the mistakes from the kitchen.  Considering this, I would probably choose to dine here again!"}
{"text":"I just love the flavors of Turkish cuisine. I feel transported away when I come to visit Alihan's."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Danica was a great server.  Falafel was great. Portions are enormous."}
{"text":"Having read other website reviews on Alihans I expected a delicious meal and a formal setting. Indeed the meal was truly delicious, but the well decorated restaurant was warm and welcoming to people in casual attire, and not at all stuffy. Our starters were the Chef Borek and Hummus and I had the Iskinder Kebab for my entrée. Everything was delicious - but special kudos go to the Chef Borek which was so good I could have eaten twenty. This is a wonderful restaurant staffed with very friendly and helpful people. Don't think that you need to be dressed formal to come here - just be sure to stop by and enjoy a delicious taste of Turkish food."}
{"text":"We had a Delicious dinner last weekend celebrating my birthday. I had made reservations and so glad I did they place was full. We started with a cold appetizer plate with a mix of all the cold appetizers, it was all very good, the hummus was my favorite. For dinner we shared the Mixed Kebabs plate the favors are out of this world just delicious !! We had no room for dessert but we will most definitely be back an try the dessert next time! Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. A lot. Don't get here as often as I'd like. I remember when they first opened I had lunch with a friend visiting from Bristol, UK; a kebab expert if you will. He and I were blown away by the food. He liked it so much we talked about FedExing food to him in England."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Not very expensive...delicious food. They served bread before bringing the order. It was really fresh and tasty. Couldn't resist and ordered some more bread."}
{"text":"It's 4° here in Pittsburgh, so  I just ran into the closest restaurant to the Renaissance Hotel. Boy did I luck out. I love Mediterranean food, but I tend to find that most Mediterranean restaurants tend to make some classic dishes extraordinarily well and others not so much. As stated in other reviews here, everything on the menu here is extraordinary. Get the mezze platter as an appetizer and sample all their amazing tips and cold apps. And the kebabs and rice pudding were fantastic. But if I was going to pick one thing on the menu, The crushed lentil soup Is by leaps and bounds the best lentil soup I have had in my life. It's worth going just for that!"}
{"text":"Stopped here before a concert around 630. Not busy and very clean inside. Had some Turkish tea , then hummus with Turkish bread which was super tasty. Main course was a mixed grill of kebabs , little bit of each kind they offered. It was amazing! Flavorful and juicy. I would not hesitate going here at all. Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! Our server Rashid was very attentive and pleasant. I ordered the Mediterranean Salad. It was huge and delicious.  I could not finish the whole salad. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity of food received. Definitely recommend!"}
