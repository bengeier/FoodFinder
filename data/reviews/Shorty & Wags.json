{"text":"Shorty and Wags is by far my favorite chicken wing place!! Not only is it a family owned business the food is amazing! The wings and tenders are crunchy,  juicy and delicious! We always get the hojos and coleslaw because we are now addicted. Jalapeño ranch is outta this world. Everything is so so good! The customer service is top notch. They answer all of your questions and are super friendly. Love it"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced considering you are given the full chicken wing. The wings were fried perfectly and the hot sauce was very good. We were also treated very kindly!"}
{"text":"Best wings ever!! I love that they're whole wings instead of split up like at most places. I don't live near here, but I loved it so much I bought their wing spice and batter online so I could make some at home. Their sauces are amazing as well and the sweet and sour is my favorite! Go check them out!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Shorty and Wags and loved their chicken wings! I am originally from Michigan and this chicken reminds me of what I grew up with. Simply delicious! I also have to say their cheese curds are out of this world!"}
{"text":"The wings and tenders are sooo good!! The seasoning they use is phenomenal! It is a family owned business which makes it very warm and welcoming. The staff are very nice and friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious wings and tenders! I really enjoyed their dry rub and buffalo sauce. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"As a Minnesotan that fell apart when Shorty & Wags closed their original location, I am ecstatic to know SW is back and as good as ever Cookie is a great owner and the wings are phenomenal  Go support S&W, you will not be disappointed  Every trip to the Desert will include a visit"}
{"text":"Being from the south side of Chicago. I love chicken wings. Growing up on Harolds I figured I'd give Shortys a try being they were from my neighbor to the north Minneapolis.    As I walked in I met a 5 ft blond bombshell, the Owner and daughter of  Wags the other half of Shorty and Wags.  I'll be honest I was a skeptic, but this 5 ft blond thru down in the kitchen like I was sitting at a chicken joint in the hood. The only thing missing was some bulletproof glass around the counter.    These wings were amazing.   I normally like my wings drowning jn sauce but the owner asked me to try em dry rub.  Oh boy I'm glad I did.  The flavor profile on these wings is amazing. I did a dipping of their hot sauce and ranch which gave it the perfect balance.    I had a 4 piece half and half. Which is two wings and two tenders.  The tenders are more meat but I also liked the crunch of the rub on the wing as well.  Can't go wrong either way.  Get the circle cut frys. They soak up the juice and the rub like a piece of white bread at the bottom.     This is my wing joint."}
{"text":"Shorty and Wags seasoning is simply the best no need for any sauce.  You won't get that anywhere else around here.  I see a lot of people complaining about the size of the wing, but I enjoy knowing that since the wings are the size a chicken wing should be that it's not pumped with antibiotics on the farm.  I also prefer the whole wing style because after all that is a true wing right?  All the other places around give you half of the wing, is that right?  I highly recommend the cheese curds as well.  If your looking to try a great wing look no further Shorty and Wags has you covered!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to have a great new wing place nearby.  Huge disappointment. Had about a 20 min wait for my take out order. Got home a few minutes later only to discover they gave me bone-in iso boneless and the fries were actually inedible. Waste of $10. Sorry folks, everything about it was bad, won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the chicken strips! Exceeded my expectations quite honestly. This is also the ONLY chicken my 1 year old will eat. We live close by so we often order a bucket of chicken strips with some hojos and bread! Delicious and quick. Great as leftovers too. Happy it's so close!"}
{"text":"I found this place just driving down Lindsey. I figured I would try it since it's so hard to find a good wing place. I took a few wings and tenders to go, the entire drive home I could just smell the deliciousness. I got home and the boys immediately took the box from me. The seasoning used is amazing, it's got a good kick, so good that you don't even need the dipping sauce. I think the tenders were my favorite, so crispy and well cooked. By far better than any wing place around. Also, if you're looking for a good sauce, I recommend their jalapeño ranch flavor."}
{"text":"Called in to place a takeout order. Owner asked if I could hold - sure! I held for a moment while he took a walk-in order. Then another. Then silence, then another. That's fine, it's a busy place and people forget. I figured could hang up and call back, causing the phone to ring again; nope, it's an archaic single line system with no call waiting. Their location is close to my house and I'm in the mood for wings, so I stop by; I walk in about 30 minutes after the initial call. Just for fun I call again while in queue, and AT&T's voice model answers - \"your call can not be completed at this time\". Sigh. It's my time to order: \"Hi, you might want to check your phone\" I say. \"Oh, did you call earlier? What do you want?\" he asks unapologetically - \"ok it'll be ready in twenty minutes.\" No discount. Great wings, bad service."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat fried chicken, but the wings are so lightly battered and fried that it's almost like they are naked wings. (I've only had the wings. I haven't tried the tenders.) The spices that come on the wings are awesome. I got sauces the first time I went there, but the dry rub seasoning is so good that I don't want to mask it with anything. Also not a huge okra fan, but my girlfriend ordered it and I tried one. I then got some for myself. The only \"negative\" is that I wish they had mac and cheese. That won't keep me away, though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good fish and chicken spot, this might not be the place for you. I've never seen fish fried like this?!?!?! I mistakenly thought this was going to be a good spot in the valley but trust me, cook it yourself at home! The fish smelled funny and was not thoroughly cooked. I was so excited to eat here but very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pics will be attached of my whole wings, rice, fried okra, potato salad, potatoes and my 2 sauces were jalapeño ranch and I believe spicy bbq! Very happy with my first visit. Friendly, and felt welcome ! Rare to find a place with whole wings so this is great! Loved my chicken and my okra most! Definitely will be back !"}
{"text":"The food here was really good. Also the customer service was exquisite. The wait for food was only a couple minutes."}
{"text":"Excited that yet another quality place opened up right by the house!  Finally stopped in and got some takeout from Shorty & Wags today and I enjoyed the food!  I will say that it is different than most wing places around, but I think that's a good thing.  Its nice to change it up every once in a while.    I got a 3-piece meal with tenders and a 12 piece bucket of wings.  The tenders were quite nice big and meaty.. Seasoned quite well.  Didn't really need to dip them in sause, but I did try a bit of the sweet & sour with it.. Very tasty.    The wings themselves were different than what I'm used to.  A dry rub, not tossed in sause (though you can order them tossed if you like).  They came out quite well.. While not necessarily as meaty as other places, 1 piece is an entire wing, so you get the drumette, the wingette, and the tip. Though they were deep fried, they were not greasy.. You can really taste the spices they used.  There is no 'heat' in these wings, but that doesn't really make them bland in my opinion.  Its just a different experience.    Again, the wings were not quite as meaty as you'd get elsewhere, but I think for the amount you get for what you pay, not a bad deal at all.  Plus they just taste good!    I will be back to try more!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"SOOOOO glad Shorty & Wags have opened up a restaurant in the Phoenix Area !!  We loved them and frequently their Minneapolis, Minnesota Restaurant at least monthly when we lived in Edina, Minnesota.  The absolutely BEST Chicken Wings ever.....and the seasoned,  buttered rice is soooooo good.  Well worth the drive !!  We will be \"regulars\" again @!"}
{"text":"This is a small little Chicken Wing Spot with a unique taste! The wings are whole... not split into drummies and flats like most places. The chicken tenders were not that tender at all! They were fried really hard and crispy! I am going to give them 1 more try but I didn't care for he first ones I ate! This place just opened last Wednesday so it may take a little time but they need some  on the wall or maybe a little music playing. I will definitely be back to try them out! Next time I will add pictures of the wings I devoured"}
{"text":"Shorty & Wags is a great little family establishment in Gilbert that is run by father and daughter.  Three plus decades ago, S&Ws got its start in Minnesota serving chicken wings battered, fried and tossed in a secret seasoning served with homemade sides.  The original location in Minnesota has closed, however, family has seen it fit to open a new location in Gilbert.  Shorty & Wags is a simple menu of chicken wings and chicken tenders, both wet battered, deep fried and seasoned with a special mix of seasoned salt & spices.  Along with the chicken are fries, coleslaw, potato salad, cheese curds, fried mushrooms, fried okra and Hojos (thinly sliced whole potatoes, lightly breaded and fried).  There also half a dozen sauce choices available that are made in-house.  Ranch, Jalapeño Ranch and Blue Cheese are made on premises.  Sweet & Sour, Spicy BBQ, Hot Buffalo and Hot Vinegar, also S&Ws recipes, are additional choices for wings or tenders, and are also offered for sale by the bottle.  You can buy the Seasoning by the bottle too.   The Shorty & Wags Seasoning adds another layer of flavor and dimension to the chicken and lends itself well to the wet batter used when frying.  The coating is not too thick and not too thin and once it crisps up, the flavors of the Seasoning shine through.  I liken the flavor of the Seasoning to a Chinese five-spice; it is not overly strong in any particular spice but is distinct in its profile, which is to say it is nicely done.  The tenders are juicy, not overly so like other places that brine the heck out of the chicken, but more natural like juiciness.  The cook of the chicken is spot on and, although fried, the chicken is not greasy.  The chicken tenders are whole white meat chicken tenderloins and are of ample size and larger than most other places, which is to say they are quite filling.  The wings, however, are on the other end of the spectrum.  Although they are the whole wing (3 sections), meat is not found in the tip section, so it does nothing to help for an already smallish wing that is in need of more meat - its flavorful, but lacking in meaty satisfaction.    The wing and tender meals are available in three, four, five or six pieces with your choice of two sides and one sauce, however when you get into the five and six piece tender meals, one sauce is NOT going to cut it.  I would like to see a reimagining of the menu that would add an additional sauce to include two, even three, sauces for the larger meals.  Also, because of the smallish wing size, an addition of 1-2 wings per order, at the same price point, would go a long way to making it a satisfying and satiating meal.  The fries are crispy tender and the coleslaw is fresh and not too sweet or acidic.  The Hojos are good, but I would be much happier with another 45 seconds in the fryer to give the outside and edges a crispier, crunchier contrast to the meaty center.  I like them as an alternative choice to french fries, but without the slight extra cook, they are lost somewhere between a potato chip shaped wedge and a scalloped potato.  The concept of S&Ws is a casual quick serve restaurant.  Orders are placed at the counter and then your food is brought to you at your table.  However, everything is made to order so expect a wait of at least six to eight minutes for your food to be prepared; this chicken takes time to make.  Call ahead and take-out orders are welcomed here and are a smart choice if you are in a hurry.  Overall, I like what is offered at Shorty & Wags.  The service is friendly; the food is quality and served with care and love.  The sauces are tasty and the fresh hot food is worth the wait.  Prices are on par with other chicken tender establishment, and you may get a bit more for your money here, but are a bit short when it comes to the wing offerings, which is to say they are high for what you get, especially with the 3pc wing meal.  They now have a Pepsi drink tower offering Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mtn. Dew, Sierra Twist, Tropicana Lemonade, Raspberry Brisk Tea and Bottled Arizona Tea Products.  I'm sure that once the wing size (or quantity) issue is addressed, and other minor regional preferences are adjusted for, Shorty & Wags will excel.  Evident is their knowledge, experience and preparation of their products as the food is tasty and flavorful.  Given time, and a few corrections for local wing expectations, I can foresee that there will be a loyal customer following like there once was in Minnesota.   Overall: 4 Stars Quality: 4.5 Stars Service: 4.5 Stars Cleanliness: 4 Stars Value: 2.5 Stars Atmosphere: 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. I ordered the 3piece wing meal. Chicken flavor was just right no dipping sauce needed however wings were way too small.seems they agreed because I was given 4.Potato salad-I prefer mine with a little more flavor. It can in a very small cup. The fried okra was good but very small portion. I will definitely return for okra"}
{"text":"Fresh, crispy, and tasty wings and chicken tenders at a reasonable price. Fries and slaw were great too. Clean place with good service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Great flavored wings at a reasonable price. The fried okra was exceptional, and wings have a great flavor. The jalapeno ranch, and buffalo sauce where really tasty, however I would have enjoyed a little spicier flavor. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great crunch on the batter. The dry rub in my opinion tasted great- it reminded my husband of a touch of chinese five spice and whole lot of southern love. It's not your average buffalo, Salt/Pepper, asiago cheese selection- which i didn't mind at all. Sauces come on the side. We tried hot vinegar and bleu cheese- good to have but not needed in my opinion as the chicken is well flavored as it is. Hojos were good- thicker than a potato chip, almost like a french fry's round and flat cousin. Everything is made to order so expect a little bit of wait. Will come back for the catfish, fried okra and cheese curds- and the wings of course."}
{"text":"The wings were by far the smallest I've ever seen they could never not sell them whole. I've seen bigger wings on quail. The flavor was good, I didn't order sides but that is the only way you could make an order of 6 a meal.  If the wings were not mini's I would have given a 4 or 5 star."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for some cheese curds, came here to check it out. Really cool story of how they came to be! Special seasoning makes the chicken the bomb.com, I got the jalapeño ranch and it was exactly what I hoped for! Really clean inside, and nice people running the place. The only complaint I have is the music, sadly, I had to get it to go because I just can't stand country music! Hahaha  Definitely go try this place, regardless of my silly hatred for the music it is still really good!   The hojos were pretty good too, a different taste than what I'm used to but not complaining! They were good!  This place seemed very family friendly as well, so bring the kids!  The chicken tenders were juicy and delicious, they were also HUGE! It's like they took breast filets covered them in the \"crack\" sauce, So good!"}
{"text":"Not a good value. We ordered a large bucket of bone in wings with two sides and it cost us $45. The \"large\" sides were not enough for 3 people. Personally, I didn't care for the wings either. They weren't very meaty. The dry-rub was flavorful but, the meat was dry. Everything is a la carte which is annoying when you're trying to feed a few people. We had the potato salad and coleslaw which were both good but, not worth the premium. I would recommend something of better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"12 wings for $16? Naw I think I'll pass lol. They are chicken wings not steaks smh. Doubt they are that good to pay pretty much double the price of every other wing place."}
{"text":"This is not a wing joint. It is a fried chicken restaurant.   They serve a very small wing. They need to change this quick. The chicken tenders are decent.   There are no hot sauces. This place is for midwestern bland tastes. Come here for an appetizer before you go to Happy Joe's for a taco pizza.   I hope they find an audience. It just won't be me."}
{"text":"Ok for being a Latina from Los Angeles I never in a million years thought that I could find a sauce hot enough for my wings but I finally  did. The chicken wings and tenders here are FANTASTIC I've never tasted wings or tenders like I have here. I highly recommend this place for chicken wings or tenders if you live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Everything was really good. I ordered the 6 piece chicken tenders, sides of hojos/potato salad, & cheese curds. Each chicken piece were huge, juicy & tender; I could've ordered less and been well off but not complaining. Cheese curds were delicious. First timer here, staff was helpful and thorough with the menu. I'll be back to try the wings!"}
{"text":"I love love shorty and wags use to go all the time in Minnesota and it didn't disappoint here taste like home the best thing I've had since moving will be back often"}
{"text":"Just tried this place, won't be back, although they cook everything fresh my fries were still limp! The wings look like they are from a large Cornish hen! Very very small! Meat has no flavor, outside skin was not crispy and just had a small amount of seasoning that tasted like Chinese 5 spice! Noooo! Not on fried chicken! And prices are too high for food amount! Rice was bland and also had 5 spice seasoning! Okra was good but small amount for price! Dinner roll is sold as a side? That should be included with dinner! There are too many other great wing places here in the valley that are far better! They have to really step up game to stay in the race here! No thanks!"}
{"text":"This place was a great find. We got 2 orders of 4 piece tenders with fries, hojos, coleslaw and potato salad.  Everything was great.  The spicy BBQ sauce is awesome.  And definitely try the jalepeno ranch sauce.  I liked the Buffalo style better than the plain.  Be prepared, it's a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Shorty & Wags has a homestyle feel and the character of the food exactly matches that. You really have the decision between wings and tenders. I tried both and I'll add right now that if you intend to get buffalo anything, you need to request that. Everything by default is otherwise \"naked\". I made that mistake on the wings, and that's on me. The wings are full wings (so not just the drumstick but the whole wing). I don't know if that is a shtick they are going for, but it felt pretty unnecessary to me. On top of that, the wings didn't have too much meat on them, so perhaps the whole wing thing is compensating? This really falls under user preference, but I wasn't really enjoying it. The tenders themselves felt they needed to be tenderized (not intentional word play) a little more. They were dense. And even though I can really dig a light breading, there wasn't enough to these tenders to make me want them again. Once again, a really homemade feel that makes me question why I didn't just make them myself.   The sides were fair. I enjoyed their coleslaw, and apparently they have a special recipe for it (intriguing?). It had a lightly sweet character to it and was still perfectly crisp. Perhaps not an adequate claim to fame, but something to enjoy none-the-less. I also tried their fries and their ho jos. The fries were shoe string, and didn't have enough bite to them. Maybe it was a fluke or their fryer grease wasn't hot enough or something, but the fries left much to be desired. The Ho Jos are circular potatoes that they describe as softer steak fries. I think I might have preferred a steak fry. These were too soft. Maybe a regional dish but I'm not going to convert to them.   If you're curious and want to support a local business, then check this place out! Surely my opinions are based on foods/food styles that I am familiar with. Sides aside (deliberate word play), this place would easily improve, in my mind, with some meatier wings (who doesn't want that?) and better prepared tenders."}
{"text":"1st time here today.  The owner was really friendly.  The wings are just like I like them..crispy and tasty.  We had the spicy bbq and the jalapeno ranch and both were excellent.  Midwest owner so makes it even more of a reason to support this small business.  We'll be ordering more soon!"}
{"text":"Another Minnesotan here so happy to make my family back home jealous! The wings were crispy and perfect. The seasoning was just how I remembered! Love that Hot Vinegar!"}
{"text":"Wings are absolutely fantastic. Would suggest getting the \"buffalo style\" fries are fresh cut and delicious as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I stopped in recently for lunch and the wings were great.  I was a bit nervous about the light breading but it turned out to be the best part. The wings were good quality and prepared very well.  The sources in the side were a nice change. The buffalo was very good and the hot vinegar was very unique and imparted a great flavor. Can't wait to return again!"}
{"text":"Can make just as good at home. Unevenly seasoned. Some were not seasoned. Others complained of too much salt"}
{"text":"This place is probably too damned close to my house for my own good. I love the whole wings. They are meaty and juicy. They are fired up naked, and sauce is on the side. You can get them \"buffalo style\" which is dipped in  sauce. The strips looked delicious. We tried the catfish and it was a bit over fried, but still had good flavor. The Hojos are fresh sliced and perfectly fried. Everything had their house dry seasoning on it. I do wish that they had some non-carb sides. Maybe green beans or a side salad. They do offer a tasty coleslaw, but raw cabbage doesn't always work with my stomach."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this new spot so I am a 1st timer!  Nice clean and friendly staff, placed a to go order and they made sure to Time it just right so my food was piping hot when I arrived. My kids and I opted for the strips and yes they are yummmy! Nice crispy and full on strip size as if I made at home.  The jalepeno Ranch was our fav  Rolls are delish! I was not a fan of fries, cannot do soggy fries and the seasoning is one I just cannot get use to. Literally wasted an entire box of fries!  The bucket was a bit pricey as I paid $40 for 24 piece and 6 xtra rolls and wasted fries.. I'd pop back in for strips and rolls only"}
{"text":"These wings were delicious! The dry rub on the wings is great on its own without needing to have a wet sauce. The sauces were great and the potatoes were awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for our first taste of Shorty & Wags. Was not disappointed. Started with cheese curds and fried okra. Both were good. The wings and tenders were excellent, perfect crispness and the dry rub was great, almost no need for a sauce but we had the jalapeño ranch and spicy BBQ. Jalapeño ranch has a nice kick to it. The owners were extremely nice and we heard the story of Shorty&Wags. Definitely we'll be back."}
{"text":"Worth a trip for the special Shorty & Wags family-recipe seasoning and unique cooking method that involves extra steps including butter. Wings are basically a moist dry rub with sauce on the side. Very tasty and complex seasoning (not spicy at all) with a comforting aroma and flavor. You can buy the seasoning online. It's unique both in flavor and method and won't be found elsewhere.  I concur with the other reviewer that the wings are too small, unfortunately. I hope they get a new supplier. I'm sure it can't be easy to procure the whole wings.   6 wings with two sauces is $9.62. Wish the hot buffalo and jalapeño ranch were spicier.  Mom and pop shop with roots back to the 1960s in Minneapolis. Friendly service.   Interior looks like it was a do-it-yourself job, which is unfortunate. Blah tile, bad design (bar area doesn't even extend over the base so you eat sideways). Needs more TVs.  They are getting wine and beer license at some point which will be nice.  Hope this place makes it. Worth supporting independent joints like this."}
{"text":"Our new neighborhood \"go to\" for wings.  Unique flavorful dry rub.  Cooked to order. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"It's not terrible but it wasn't the best I'd ever had. A little bit too salty for me and I also like my wings to be butchered into flats and drums. Without the butchering, it's just fried chicken in my opinion. They're hot vinegar sauce was great though. We also tried their fried okra and mushrooms as well. I'm glad they offer them but they weren't  anything special. The portions for the shrooms and okra were also really small and if I'd known they were that small, I probably wouldn't have ordered them. The restaurant itself though was really clean and we received great customer service."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the best chicken wings. Support local businesses (Not associated with them) forget the chains! Thanks S & W."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in a very long time! The hojos and coleslaw are fantastic as well! Wings have amazing flavor and so crispy and juicy inside. The seasoning on the hojos especially good"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for WINGS! my experience was top notch and i look forward to going again.  It took a while for my order to come out but that was okay for fresh food. Which by the way was piping hot!!! Excellent! We tried the coleslaw and it was made from scratch.  I appreciate that.  They also make their own jalapeno ranch which was superb!   The owner was very hospitable,  changing the channel for us and checking to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.    PSA:there IS a difference between wings and wingettes! There's no such thing as boneless wings those are just tenders."}
{"text":"Walking into the place there was a smell I didn't expect. Some spice you don't normally smell from fried chicken so I was intrigued. We ordered 6 wings and 6 tenders family meal with potato salad, and the sliced potatoes with spicy bbq, blue cheese, and jalapeño ranch.  Whatever the special rub is, it's delicious. It was the rub that had that unique smell I couldn't figure out what it was, but it sure tasted good. The whole wings were super crispy but on the small side. The tenders is the way to go. They are very lightly battered but had this crunch to them I've never had. They were large and tender on the inside. Super good.  Sauces were delish. Loved the jalapeño ranch and blue cheese! I wish they were larger in size because they were so good.  Potato salad was good. Rolls were soft. Reminded me of Hawaiian sweet rolls.  Then the potatoes. Ehhhh. Maybe if we ate our food there, they would have remained crispy, but they were just a soggy oily mess when we ate them at home."}
{"text":"Shorty & Wags have arrived! Wow, my favorite wing joint from Minnesota (my native homeland) has erected itself from the dead and shown up in my new state of residence. I feel so honored, seeing as how I was devastated along with the other residents of Minneapolis when our favorite chicken joint was closed down.   This is not your standard chicken restaurant as this place has roots dating back to the 60's. Not to mention hardcore fans of their famous crack-like seasoning that is generously spread on all of their sides and chicken. After discovering the restaurants existence here in Arizona, and the food tasting exactly as I remember growing up I'm sure to make a lot of folks back home jealous.   I also need to add that the best chicken I ever fried at home was using their batter & seasoning they have for sale. Just a little note for the restaurant owners: if the folks here in Arizona don't appreciate the wonderful chicken flavors you're sharing with them then take it back to Minnesota where you're still missed! Amen."}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Not the party wings either, they serve whole wings. The food is so fresh you have to wait a few minutes for it to cool off. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique and delicious blend of flavors. Their chicken strips are out of this world! So crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. The jalapeño ranch was delicious and their wing sauce was just perfect. Fries were fresh and so very tasty. Great customer service. Two thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"I had these wings when they were in Minneapolis. I am hooked. I buy the seasoning and batter online. My favorite sauce is the sweet and sour. However mixing the buffalo and spicy barbecue is pretty dang good too.  I plan on visiting this restaurant when I get to Arizona.  I can't wait. My mouth is watering! I highly recommend you check this out."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and I was kind of disappointed with the size of there wings, their big push or Hook is whole wings !!! I ordered the 6 whole wing meal, I had (1) medium size wing and the other (5) kept getting smaller and smaller until I wasn't sure what kind of bird it came from !!! I enjoyed that it was cooked the way wings are supposed to be cooked with NO breading ( I'm From Buffalo, NY the Original Home of the Chicken Wing !!! LOOK IT UP !!!) the seasoning was flavorful, but it didn't work for me on the potatoes at all. I believe in second chances with most restaurants, so I will give them one more try and get back to you on it."}
