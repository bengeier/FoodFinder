{"text":"Perfectly unique!  I have a passion for locally owned restaurants. I always feel there is a reason why someone would want to work so hard. This is one of those places that take pride in what they do. You can tell when the owners care.  This is now one of my favorite places. The coleslaw is made from scratch and mixed right before is it served. Probably the best coleslaw I have ever had.  The club sandwich was almost too big to eat (ok I lied it was too big to eat), and looked exactly like the picture. They must go through a lot of to go containers because everyone takes there leftovers home for later. My impression was that nothing was skimped on. Trust me this place is a real jewel- great food and very good service.  If you leave hungry it will be your own fault because, you will get plenty to eat."}
{"text":"Chef's Grill and Deli has good home cooked food. The portions are large and the specials taste great. I highly recomend this establishment to everyone. It is right next to my barber so I can eat great food and get a great haircut."}
{"text":"I eat lunch at this place most days. The burgers are great, the sandwiches are just fine and the chicken salad is to die for!!! I'll even say that their cole slaw is just as good as my Mom's! 

Yes this place is small but ya gotta start somewhere and hope that the clientele will come before you over-expand! 

On any given day, I would rather give my lunch money to these folks than a chain restaurant for fast food.

Go try 'em and tell em Lisa sent you!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It started off as a place to take my lunch break while I was at work but afterwards, even now, I go out of my way to eat there every once in a while. Love the food and the prices! I would really recommend the CHEESE STEAK!"}

{"text":"I like small, mom-and-pop establishments like Chef's Grill and Deli. They don't have that corporate feel and the food is individualized. That is the one reason I stopped by Chef's, which occupies the strip mall spot once occupied by \"Claude's\", then Tukee's and finally \"Hawg and Dawg\". Claude's and the original Tukee's was great, then Tukee's switched to a catering format, and closed soon after, Hawg and Dawg was open only for a few months before the staff decided they'd rather stay home. Now Chef's is trying to make a go of the restaurant equivalent of the \"Black Hole of Ahwatukee\". 

The food is OK, that's it. I had the pastrami sandwich which was dry and actually kind of nasty. One of my partner's had the Philly Steak, which he pronounced good, while the other had the Club which was said to be delicious. We also got fries, which were overcooked and stale by the time we were served, and potato salad which must have been served from a tub (like CostCo). Total bill for the 3 of us was like $26. There is nothing special to draw anyone to this place, which brings me to what will seem like a kiss of death to the owner. 

Chef's has very limited seating capacity. If they could get 10 people into the dining room it would be crowded. The kitchen seems bigger than the dining room. So assuming they fill up with 10 people, and have a turn of 2 during lunch, at their busiest they would serve 20 people. There are no businesses nearby to support a carryout trade, so they'll have to make it on 20 bodies at their busiest. Assuming each has a tab of $10, their total daily cash flow will be $200. I don't know what their rent, food and utility costs are, but I would guess that mom and pop are making WAY less than minimum wage for this establishment, and that is assuming the place is filled daily. When we were there it was the three of us and a couple. Five bodies. Zero carryout. There is nothing to draw people there. They are DOOMED!  DOOMED I tell you!!!

What they need is triple the capacity, a lunch menu that was out of the ordinary, and a location with both business and foot traffic. Two of those three won't happen at this location. 

I'm afraid this is a nice vanity business that mom and pop honestly thought would make a go of it, but reality bites. I just hope the real estate agent that located this spot for them sleeps at night. I also hope the next guy who has to prove themselves as being worthy of the title of \"Chef\" does a little business research before they take over once Chef's closes. 

Sorry guys. it isn't going to work for you."}
