{"text":"4 stars becuz its cheap and clean 3 stars bcuz they do NOT sell meat only frozen products but i would luv2 buy hormone free meat, also their fruit nd veg section is very poor, next to nothing to choose from, maybe 3 kinda fruits,  and they sell vegetables i dont really use(various onions and garlic and salad), i could appreciate if they sold organic corn which is hard to get, paprika or pepper,jalapeno, nice strawberries, etc, or pear , peach...  so i just end up in loblaws or metro, im not going to travel miles for a bag of potato and then 5 other kind of vegs i have to buy somewhere else, why would i waste extra time... and there was no free parking, and the paid spots were also full! I am not going to pay parking just to buy some teas and pastas, they also do NOT have milk soy or ricemilk selection! neither do they have any bakery products, i love organic bakery but at least whole grain bread... I do not think I am visiting in the next 4 months"}
{"text":"I used to be a very loyal customer to the Big Carrot, just a couple of blocks away from The Healthy Planet.  The other day, I went to The Healthy Planet to buy protein powder, and happened to browse the beauty aisle.  I was stunned to  see the hair colour that I usually buy at the Big Carrot for $5.00 cheaper here.  I also noticed a couple of other items a couple of dollars cheaper than that of the Big Carrot.  It's nice to see there is an alternative to the Big Carrot, and I will consider the Healthy Planet as my \"go to\" place now, instead.  The beauty aisle is not as big the the Big Carrot, but as the another poster said, if you are not picky about the brand, this is a great place to shop.  I hope they keep their prices competitive like this, it makes a big difference in this economy and will definitely keep me (and I'm sure many others) a consistent shopper.  It's clean, spacious, I have always encountered kind staff.  Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place offers bad service, standard products, and normal prices. I find the attitude of the salespeople puzzling to frustrating. One time, I was recommended a product that was specifically what I had asked to avoid. The staff generally act as if they're doing me a favor by helping out. The store layout changes frequently, and most of the merchandise is available elsewhere in the neighbourhood. Why shop here?"}
{"text":"Probably the worst store on the Danforth for health products. I live across the street and was thrilled when they opened. I could seriously walk to Carrot Common and back, faster then waiting in their lines.   Today was ridiculous, I had a question and checked the aisles for help, nobody. Going to the front cash, seeing 1 employee, on a Saturday afternoon! Terrible, he had a good 10 people deep on his line, turned and left, only to see a help wanted cashier sign, been there for months.  Riverdale won't stand for horrible customer service, get it together or you wont survive. Customer service doesn't cost a penny, you need actual employees first. Seriously"}
{"text":"Rotten customer service and increasingly overpriced products!  I was a fan of this place right up until my last experience.  One of their employees tried to insult my intelligence in an effort to up-sell a different brand of a product I had previously purchased from them containing a lesser quantity at the same price.  I spent a good bit of money at Healthy Planet on that visit, left to shop in the area and returned for some more organic produce that I could not find in the other stores. Big mistake, the same employee grabbed the bags of produce that I had selected, swung them up in the air and slammed them back down onto the counter.  The staff at this location are not knowledgeable about the products in the store and they are rude."}
{"text":"Great deals when you know what you're looking for! I just wish they would stock up their bulk section a bit more, plus get some more earth balance & navitas naturals products :)"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers that customer service at this store leaves a lot to be desired. They rarely answer the phone, most of the staff are just shelf stockers who look unhappy to be there. You would think if working stock is their primary function the shelves would be well-stocked, but no, more than half the time what I want is not on the shelf. Is it just this location or are they all like this?"}
{"text":"This place is still a gem to be discovered by many, not in terms of organic food and grocery selection, but the body care and facial products.  Each time I visit this store, I'm surprised at how quiet it is inside.  Before this location opened, I visited the Big Carrot all the time for my essential oil and body care products.  During my first time shopping at the Healthy Planet, out of curiosity, I did a mental comparison of the product selection and the prices.  Surprisingly, I found many products that I use were in-stock and sold at a lower price.   My observations so far:  - Essential oils: The Healthy Planet does not carry as many brands as the Big Carrot.  However, if you are not picking about the brands, the prices are most definitely lower at the Healthy Planet.  For example, I bought a bottle of the Aura Cacia Lavender oil at the Big Carrot for $14.99, found it in the Healthy Planet for $9.99.   - Shampoo's / body wash - They carry an extensive selection of the mainstream organic brands.extensive selection available.   - Body lotion / creams - Also good selection available.  I found the body butter that I normally use at the Healthy Planet for $5 less than the Big Carrot.  In most cases, it's a hit and miss where a retailer offers a product lower priced for one product but more expensive for another.  It's refreshing to shop at a place and be confident that the prices, regardless of the product, is one of the lowest.   One word of caution though - I have also been to the location inside Parkway Mall at Ellesmere and Victoria Park.  The atmosphere inside the store, and the product selection is vastly different."}
{"text":"Yes, nobody has ever come up to me and ask if I needed help. But that's never happened to me at the Carrot either. I honestly don't care if there is anyone here to help me. I've done my research and I know what I need/what I'm looking for. The store is large enough and usually busy enough that you can bumble, loiter, and read ingredients by yourself without feeling awkward or uncomfortable.   They have a big selection of natural beauty products (some that they don't sell anywhere else) and I actually feel like the prices are better than the Carrot (could be my imagination, oh well).   But I travel cross town to get my oils, soaps, and hair products from here."}
{"text":"Poor business practices. They do not accept store gift cards after one year, even though they don't have an expiry date.   Overpriced. The exact same healthy products or organic product can be found cheaper at other grocery stores."}
{"text":"I'm a regular shopper here. I would say their prices are definitely better than the Big Carrot and Ottway (which used to have the best prices). But I definitely agree that Healthy Planet has trouble keeping things in stock. And when they run out, it seems to take forever to get it back in again. This also seems to be an issue at the Eglinton Town Centre location. I don't think bricks and mortar retailers can complain about people resorting to online shopping if they can't keep things in stock."}
{"text":"They don't walk their talk, plain and simple. So much potential and so little substance. Better than Ottway but that's no prize.  I was excited when I first discovered this place a year ago. No more, this store has proven to be a continuous disappointment. The policies of this store is exactly why I prefer to buy my organic products at a regular super market.  Nothing more frustrating than to try a new product, like it, buy it numerous times and then it is always out of stock because they are trying to reduce inventory on a similar product and they want you to buy that instead. This store is continuously out of stock of items I would consider main stay items for this reason.  I don't think I am alone when I say people that shop in these types of stores are fussy (that's why we come here) so to continuously let them down will only drive them away.  I find regular super markets are becoming more reliable.  The customer service people can be frustrating too. You make it clear what you don't  want and that's what they will try to sell you. Just because something says organic doesn't meant it is not processed.  I expect more from a shop like this otherwise I may as well buy at loblaws, in time they will expand selection with support.  I was able to find Allimax Garlic Caps here at an amazing price."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy shopping at this Healthy Planet because I rarely feel welcome in the store. For me, it's a very transactional, no-frills experience. I walk in, grab my items, and go. With the exception of one woman who usually asks if I need help looking for a product, I find the employees at this store to be apathetic and almost unfriendly as they do not make eye contact or make an effort to greet you.   My biggest annoyance about this store, however, is that I always have to check the receipt to see if they've bumbled the price. In the past year of shopping, I have probably had it happen about 3 or4 times. Since there is usually only one cashier present, it means I have to line up all over again to have their mistake corrected. It's usually a small difference, but since it happens at such a usual rate, it all adds up. Everything is on a digital POS, so why is it so hard to get the price right? It's just sketchy when a store advertises one price and doesn't comply with it.   Besides their competitive pricing relative to the Big Carrot (my preferred grocery!), their only other saving grace is that they have a loyalty program which allows you to redeem money back on your purchase."}
{"text":"Overpriced and cheap. I get emails from this place almost everyday, and the highest discount I've EVER recalled them having was \"10% off your purchase!!!*       *purchase must be over $199.99.\""}
{"text":"This is one of my regular stops on my food runs. This place is smaller than The Big Carrot with less selection BUT on items they both have this place is always cheaper so I grab the specialty items here and the specialty-specialty items at the carrot. I buy things like kefir, sprouted tofu, natural mac & cheese, and supplements here. There is also a little juice cafe deal and hot table/salad bar with prepared foods. If you're into healthy living or just pretend to be like me, this place will save you some money."}
{"text":"Standard Healthy Planet store. This location has produce, though it's usually not very good. Most of the grocery stores (incl fruit&veggie stores) on the Danforth have huge selections of organic foods. Also, just go to any of the nearby farmers markets during the summer. This location has the same overpriced products as any other. Healthy Planet is the only place that sells PUR gum, that I know of, and so that's why I've been in there. Unfortunately, Bulk Barn stopped selling it due to low sales.  I don't recommend shopping at Healthy Planet unless they stock something you can't find elsewhere. Their business practices are shitty.  They call themselves \"Healthy Planet\" yet their cash registers print out ridiculously long receipts on thick paper. A single 89c purchase gets you a foot long receipt. It doesn't really matter if the paper is recycled or not, it's still a huge waste of paper.  They often have people in their stores promoting and selling people products that aren't healthy. I'm pretty sure they had people promoting some shitty fad diet. They've had people inside of their stores doing \"tests\" for \"imbalances.\"  The products they sell are often not healthy and not healthy for the planet. Huge sections of their stores are dedicated to unhealthy items such as granola bars. As any other grocery store, they tend to have a variety of any one type of product--the problem is that they sell products containing ingredients that are bad for the environment (usually due to how they are harvested), or just bad for consumption. They could easily not stock those items while still having products from other brands available.  The point is that there is no quality control in what they sell, nor in what they promote. The name of their chain is opposite of what they are pushing. Their practices are generally unhealthy to the planet."}
{"text":"Nice location. Warden is still my favourite but I love that this one is conveniently located on the Danforth right outside of Chester Stn. I didn't buy anything, I just went inside to check it out as I've never seen this location before. It's really close to where I live so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This location has a better than average assortment of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and various other supplements. If you're looking for a particular item chances are you'll find it here. The staff are knowledgable and helpful all things considered. Don't expect any bargains though. I'm often able to find for cheaper elsewhere, especially through online ordering."}
{"text":"Useless. 80% of the merchandise is snake oil. The rest is overpriced kale snacks."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. Its close to the subway and carries almost all the natural products that I want - organic coconut oil, aloe vera gel. The store helpers are also moderately helpful in helping you make smart shopping decisions. And the service has always been friendly - no complaints!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this a one for a few reasons, but mostly due to the lack of care in customer service. I have shopped here for a year, and have had too many bad experiences, in person and over the phone, and no longer shop here.   The staff are unprofessional and disrespectful, and have zero skills in customer care or professional manner.   Their food shelves are often poorly stocked, week after week, untidy, and the aisles are strewn with un-opened boxes on the floor. The cash desk is usually a complete disaster with flyers, supplement bottles, bags and boxes cluttering the small check-out area. On numerous occasions they have over-charged me on discounted items, and rarely is there more than one person on check-out to handle such problems.  They don't spend a moment caring about their customer, their stock, or the way the store looks, and I won't spend another penny in this store."}
{"text":"at roughly 2:00 feb 9 2018 I called this healthy planet to ask about a product a nutritionist named \"kayla\" -If that was her real name; hung up the phone on me in the middle of me asking about the price of a product. So i called back and she kept hanging up on me. So i kept calling determined to speak with a manager after that rude encounter. when the employee finally picked up she was rude so i asked to speak to a manager. After going back and forth with this rude nutritionist kayla; She finally handed the phone off to a male who i thought was the manager and he proceeded to blame me for them hanging up the phone; That i should be understanding when i asked for the employee's name he refused. I asked him several times for his name but he refused  and was very rude about it. Considering i just spent over 100$ at this store. I felt really disrespected. I was going to be a loyal customer but after this i will never go back to a healthy planet again. with the attitude these employees have i hope the owner knows it wont be much longer before they lose all there loyal customers."}
{"text":"Yessssss FTR!  Can't believe I beat Jen K and Johnny H haha.   Healthy Planet is a healthfood grocer that has recently opened on the Danforth.  It's very clean and organized and also houses an Organic Vegetarian Bistro/Salad bar and cafe.  Fairly good selection of goods at similar pricing to other healthy/organic grocers, my one caveat though is that they do not have a dry baked goods department :(    It's still too early to weigh-in too heavily on how good or bad HP is for now, but I'll definitely say the Gluten free treats offered from the Juice/Espresso bar are incredible!!"}
