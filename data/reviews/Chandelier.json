{"text":"A little pricey, and the quality and service was not there to match.  Had the filet sandwich was very much overcooked (you could not request how you wanted it cooked), the beef was not at all tender, probably because it was over cooked.  The pizza was OK and the salad was great!  There wine bar looked interesting but I am not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"It's not often that I try a new restaurant and actually go to the trouble of adding it to a review site....  Chandelier wasn't in Yelp and wow should it be.  I come to Montreal on business frequently and was looking for a late afternoon lunch so I asked the staff at the Loews Vogue Hotel where I normally stay - He recomended this place as one of his favorites and also gave me a second option.  Chandelier was basically around the corner so I went there.  It was a nice laid back yet sophisticated look.  There was a number of items on the menu that appealed to me but I settled on the Vegetable soap (soup of the day) and the burger (the truffle oil mayo and homemade ketchup won me over!).  The friend I was with also ordered the mushroom, olive oil and brie on toast appitizer.  Vegetable soup - broth was amazing, soup was very hot and hearty!  would recomend anytime!  Mushroom appitizer - WOW - the toast was perfect with mushrooms drizzled with olive oil and I think a hint of garlic and then melted brie over top - I am not only a convert but will be making this at home!!!!  Burger - pretty good burger and bun - patty wasn't as moist or big as it could have been but the mayo and ketchup was great - came with nice juicy slices of tomato - not your normal Safeway hothouse, flavouless special....  They made a mistake and brought us fries as well - very pleasent mistake - unlike a lot of the fries in restaurants in the same area - these were crisp and had their own character - I found them extramly good.  Bottomline - next time I am here in Montreal Chandelier will be a lunch spot!!!!  I"}
{"text":"The location is the best thing about this place. The food is, at best, edible, and will get the job done. One of our two servers botched an entree order, despite repeating it and confirming it to my table. The other server, thankfully, did replace it without hesitation, but became somewhat surly by the time our meal was winding to a closer.  Highly recommended for: people watching."}
