{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the coffee house space is nice as is the bar.  There seems to be alot going on and not sure they have it all figured out.  Food was very good except for the golden yukon side - a huge disappointment.  The daily special was sold out by 6:30pm - Really?  Service as mediocre at best.  Would give it another try but think they have some work to do to make it a great experience.  The patio space is very nice!"}
{"text":"A big let down! After being seated, we waited over 10 minutes for water and then another 15 for our waiter. We opted to place our entire order knowing that there may be another wait. No surprise... the mules that we ordered hadn't come in 15 minutes so I went up to the bar myself. The bartender eventually brought our mules over, but the copper mugs were barely half full. I've never received a cocktail (a $9 one nonetheless) half-filled! Our appetizer came out just before our entrees and the waiter not once apologized or checked in on our dining experience. The only thing going for this place is their tempura zucchini. Overall, thumbs down! Hopefully management and service will get their act together!"}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped here by chance but our next visit will be on purpose. Great food though the menu is a little small yet. High quality I expect the menu to increase the longer they are open. 
Really clever design of space. Drinkers can drink. Diners can dine and the coffee bar calls to me. With no Starbucks close by this will be a goto spot for sure. Coffee AC and s book oh baby.
The patio was delightful. A storm threaten and the manage kept an eye on the radar to bring us inside without getting out feet wet. That earned a point by itself!!7
If you go try the Malva cake. Hard to describe;hard to forget. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid, consistent place to go! They have great food and fun cocktails, and a decent beer selection. The outdoor space is awesome, but they have plenty of seating indoors as well. It's much bigger than you'd think. 4 stars instead of 5 because the service an be very slow sometimes. Everyone is always really nice when they finally get around to you, though. This is an appropriate place for any occasion - a quick drink or a full meal."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago with my boyfriend and another couple. I really loved the mix of coffee shop, bar and restaurant. He drinks were good and about standard prices. The food was really tasty (I had a burger). The Sriracha chicken spread with pork rinds is a good time."}
{"text":"Food was odd but very tasty. Drinks were not strong enough to justify the cost though. The service leaves a bit to be desired. I wish I could give it 3.5"}
{"text":"So beautiful! Inside and out. Not only beautiful but neat too. The hostess was friendly and seated us right away. 
Wow, walking back to our table I was surprised how big this place actually was! There was two bars from what I saw. We were told one was a \"coffee bar\" and they were now open until 2 a.m. They serve \"coffee cocktails\", the hostess said it is a treat that not everyone has caught onto yet but give it time and that place will be flooded until 2 a.m. 
We were seated in the way back. Only one downfall, the two top tables were so close together. I felt one move I was going to bump into the person next to me and I also feel I have to refrain myself from certain things ... Like swearing... Never fun. 
However, the server was nice and the food was delicious. Anywhere that serves tacos... Let alone pulled pork tacos... Is a good place to me! You only get two but they fill it up so much with meat you don't need more than two! The prices weren't too bad. I had the tacos and two beers for around $15.00.
I left feeling satisfied and I definitely want to try again! 
Recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for dinner, because we saw that they were featuring the new Oscar blues IPA  on tap. We wanted to also eat here because they have great outdoor seating.  We ordered the fish and chips and Shepard's pie. Both were delicious and pretty generous portions. I thought it was reasonably priced and well worth the money. We will definitely stop here again. This place also has a coffee house inside which smelled really good when walking through to get to the back patio. I may have to stop and try that one day as well. Another one of many great resturaunts in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"I really wanted, and still do, to love this place.  I scouted it during renovation and had such high hopes.  The reality has been quite disappointing.

First - Lawrenceville is obviously the hipster spot, so you know what vibe you're going to get, but this place takes it to a new level.  In fact, 'trying too hard' is a pretty good description of the staff.  It's as if they're more focused on looking and acting the part than serving the customers?  I've been in countless times now, and never once could I say I received good service, most of the time you feel like you're annoying them.  And whatever you do, don't stop here in the morning to grab a 'quick' cup of coffee.  Prepare to watch a barista exhibition that will surely make you late for work.

Second - the food is just 'meh.'  Some decent things on the menu for sure, but in no way do I recommend this as a must eat restaurant.  Grab a beer,...maybe a bite...but there are so many better meals for the dollar right down the street.

Third - the tvs - consistent with my first point above, instead of playing sports, they will show you old black and white silent films, or in the back bar area they'll show you a lava lamp styled color screen.  I came in here one night to grab a beer and watch the rest of the game, and the resident hipster scoffed at my idea that they might actually, you know, show something on the screen that someone wants to watch.  But sure, cater to all of the people coming in that say 'could I see what 1920s B-movies you have?'  It's Pittsburgh, stop trying so hard.  Put a game on.  

Fourth - the patio.  What a beautiful patio.  What a drastically underwhelming vibe for such a beautiful patio.  I understand having a dinner crowd and seating for that, but this place is aching to have more of a nightlife scene around the fireplace (which they don't light) or the fountain.  Either choose fine dining with great food and accompanying ambiance, or choose fun atmosphere and casual drinking.  They are squarely in the middle with no direction.

Finally - they do have decent beer on tap and actually figured out to make coffee drinks with alcohol.  Credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Party of 2.  Arrived around 7:15 pm, we had reservations for 7:15 pm.

We were seated promptly, and the hostess was smiling and personable.  The side salads we ordered to have prior to our meal were fresh and the dressing was pleasant.  That's all I have to say that's positive about this place.

The service was slow (but oh wow, how quickly our server managed to pick up our check & take our money), our server never asked us how our food was, I had to ask 3 different people who brought food to our table or cleared plates for more water, the food was overpriced and I would deem it nothing better than \"edible,\" the environment was far too loud to carry on a conversation, and the interesting lighting choices are overpowered by the huge television behind the bar.

My server asked if I wanted to wrap up half of the leftover hummus (I ordered it as a main dish because I wasn't particularly hungry) and I said \"No thank you, it wasn't good,\" and the server replied: \"Oh, that's too bad.\"  I feel like any sort of follow-up question might've saved me from deciding to never patronize this place again.  Like: \"Oh, how was it not to your liking?\" or even-- because again, I ate only half of it-- asking a manager to give us some sort of discount or coupon for future use or something, anything to demonstrate any sort of actual interest in the customer's experience.

Maybe we caught them on a bad night or at a bad time, I don't know.  If that's the case, as a customer, that's not my problem.  I've had very few dining experiences that were as bad as this one, and I don't ever want to go to The Abbey again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Lawrenceville.  You can go here for any occasion whether it's getting a coffee and relaxing on the couch, grabbing a drink at the bar or enjoying dinner outside.  This place has a really cool atmosphere that sets it apart from any other restaurant.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place could have had the best food in the world served up by Elvis and I would NEVER give them my $$$. 

I came in on a Sunday around 5:00pm. I walked through the front doors and had to walk past the bar to get to the host stand? Bizarre but okay. I get there and  ask for a table for two outside. The host replies \"What are you planning to have?\" WHAT? I DON'T KNOW! I've never been here before, haven't seen the menu. I respond, not sure. Apps and/or a meal. He then tells me \"Well, if you want to sit outside, you have to order an entree or you'll have a $25/person minimum\" so I ask to see the menu. There are at max 10 entree options varying from appx $12-25, however none of these options are a salad? I then said \"Do you not have a salad option as an entree?\" and was told that if I wanted a salad that would be considered a starter and I would then be charged a $25/person minimum. I understand that a business doesn't want someone coming in and ordering an iced tea and taking up their table during their busy hours however, I seriously can't sit outside and have a salad when you only have 4 tables full on a Sunday? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I was wiling to be a paying customer. I was going to order a salad at whatever price tag was associated with it. I was maybe even going to get an appetizer and/or a drink. My friend was also going to order some food as well. What was so uncool is that I didn't even have an opportunity to sit down and look at a menu to decide what I wanted. I had to make that decision while I was standing at the host stand. Did I want to order a $10 salad and be charged $25? Did I want to not eat healthy and get an entree instead to avoid the $25 minimum? Did I want to order a salad and an app to meet the minimum? All while there was no wait for a table and the outdoor section wasn't even 1/3 full. 

I will not return to the Abbey on Butler no matter how cool your outdoor section may look or how good I hear your food is. Your protocols and the way your treat your customers is unacceptable and I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and came here for brunch.  Awesome space, friendly staff, and good food!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on May 14th. My lady and I have been eagerly awaiting the new addition to Larryville and were really excited to finally get a chance to try it out. Super great and creative concept but terrible execution. 
When we first walked in it was really confusing. There was a sign that said that there was no hostess which I found really odd considering that this place just opened a few weeks ago. We wandered around a bit trying to find a table. The majority of the tables were empty but really dirty. In the room to the left which I'm guessing is their cafe there was a man sleeping in one of the lounge chairs with a baseball cap over his head and his feet up on the table in the center of the chairs. We went back to the main room and saw that the brunch buffet was $18 and when we looked at the items in the chaffing dishes it was basically a dried out version of a hotel continental breakfast. I wouldn't have paid $5. We decided to settle for a quick drink before leaving in search of a better brunch option but as we approached the bar the bartender was taking a mouthful of pizza that was obviously not available on the brunch buffet. While I can't compliment her service, at least she had good enough taste to order a pizza in rather than eat her own product. She went straight from the pie to grab a bottle and start making a drink for a customer and that was all it took for us to leave. We will definitely not be returning if this is the type of service  that customers should expect on a regular basis which is a shame because the design gave it so much potential."}
{"text":"We had great food and great service. Sriracha chicken dip was great.  Their provolone bacon burger is one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh.  If you love burgers, try it and you will love it."}
{"text":"I will not be coming back unless it is for coffee and I have it on the patio. The hosts/hostesses aren't wearing uniforms and are unidentifiable in a crowd, especially when you are waiting for a table in another room and have no idea who to expect to call your name. The bussers didn't clean the coffee table in the coffee lounge until we asked them to do so. This was well before the Saturday night rush and dirty dishes were everywhere on the empty tables. The waitstaff seems very inexperienced and our waiter literally read the specials from his notebook like a robot. The menu is extremely limited and the food is extremely overpriced for the quality. Just putting Siracha on something doesn't increase its value or appeal. Two shrimp for $5? Mashed potatoes for $7?There are FAR superior places to eat in Lawrenceville. This place feels like Yinzers who are trying to be hip. Increase the menu options and train your waitstaff if you expect to maintain a competitive edge in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Don't get trapped by the cool atmosphere.  If you're like me and think you'll get homemade biscuits if you pay $5, think again - not only were they not homemade but they were also frozen  corned beef hash was way too much hash in all in greasiness. I feel the need for a Tums half way thru. Monte Cristo was ok, not the best.  If given the redo on the afternoon, I should have just stopped by Giant Eagle and made brunch myself with fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Great space, totally mediocre food and (overpriced) drinks. The menu makes no sense - it seems like they want to be fancy, but the food doesn't live up to that, and the variety of items on the menu is frankly kinda bizarre. Decide what you want to focus on, and do it well, rather than trying to do everything poorly. I was really excited for this place, and gave it several chances, hoping it would get better, but nope. Not worth a visit."}
{"text":"Drinks are full of ice!!! I felt ripped off!! A place like this serving like this sucks! I've been here a few times and I live the atmosphere! I love the food, the people...and yes, I had a few good drinks..but tonight it was a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Kitchen closed from 3:15 to 4:00. Uncommon, but we were prepared to be flexible. Offered us seats to wait in the sun. We asked for low tables in the shade to wait. We were refused even though other patrons were seated finishing their meal. We were told by the manager that people would be confused if we were allowed to sit there. 
They were not accommodating and were patronizing. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Did I just eat brunch at The Abbey or at the Hilton Garden Inn? For a whopping $18 you are offered a buffet that includes gummy scrambled eggs, over seasoned potato wedges, greasy thin strips of bacon, sausage, old French toast, hockey puck biscuits, vegan gravy, and a made to order omelettes station (the only positive).  Their selection of brunch cocktails cost eight dollars
each. Get ready to spend a lot of money for a very lackluster brunch."}
{"text":"NOT KID FRIENDLY:: I was beyond disappointed and almost a little outraged to find that there was no changing table in the women's bathroom. I asked an employee if there was one somewhere else in the restaurant and was told 'no, I'm sorry. We're really not kid friendly.' He apologized again. I then asked if I could change my 7 month old on a bench and was told by another employee that for sanitary reasons, I could not. I said well where can I change her and simply received a shrug and I'm sorry for sanitary reasons... 
no highchairs or boosters.
Food was decent but I was pretty much just trying to contain my disappointment through what should have been a nice afternoon with friends."}
{"text":"This place started out as a great spot but it is quickly devolving into something terrible. I don't dish out 1-star reviews without good reason but my last 3 experiences here have been terrible with the servers and bartenders. Tonight it took me nearly 40 minutes to get a check after being continuously ignored by the waitstaff. Part of the issue might be that one of the female bartenders drinks on the job and would rather socialize than do her job. I have spotted her doing shots with patrons on several occasions, not only is this absolutely illegal it just shows you how quickly things can get out of hand when you don't install the right culture in your establishment from the get-go. There is still plenty of potential and hope for this place but I won't be going back until they weed out the problems."}
{"text":"This former funeral home turned restaurant bar was very interesting. Interesting article was lining the walls and the whole place was inviting. We made a reservation and were taken immediately to our table. The waiter was very friendly and our orders came quickly . The butlers chicken was delicious (spicy) as was the Abbey normal Mac and cheese. The menu was a bit pricey but overall it was worth it."}
{"text":"The place is really nice looking and its a cool environment but the food is meh.  I usually just go for the coffee bar to hang out and do work.  I wouldn't spend the money on their food which is mediocre.  But its definitely worth stopping by to get an espresso and write some code."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was not kid friendly- my bad. But when the hostess asked me to take my baby out and around the building in the rain Because a private party was in the hallway and she didn't want me to push him through-I was taken aback. The gentlemen graciously stepped aside for me, thankfully. But that was completely ridiculous. Food was ok- nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was decent, given it was an old funeral home."}
{"text":"Love the brunch menu. Has lots of Great  selection of alcohol. Have friends who don't eat meat? Well they can find a few unique dishes here. So it's good for the whole gang ."}
{"text":"This place is hard to categorize but it sure is interesting. Part bar, part cafe and restaurant all mixed together. We just stopped for coffee, but will return to try the food."}
{"text":"A little restaurant set in an interesting venue. You have choices of which you would like to go to go to from a restaurant to a coffee house all under one roof! The menu was rather limited for brunch but everything we had was wonderful  We enjoyed their craft beer choices. The only unfortunate part of it is we were sitting outside and it began to rain, however, the waitresses were wonderful at getting everybody reseated inside of the restaurant"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and this place is phenomenal! Drinks, coffee or food - all good choices! Great place to meet friends, eat a delicious meal quietly, or hang out and get some work done in the coffee house section. Staff is super friendly and accommodating and makes you feel like they're glad you're here. highly recommend this place!  (Just had the corn cakes and crab and it was awesome!)"}
{"text":"I only went for coffee, and it was a great place to settle down with a Scrabble game to relax. I got the affogato, which was really yummy. They use vanilla ice cream and a little whipped cream. I'm not usually a fan of whipped cream, but there was only a little bit of whipped cream, so the overall mix was great. They use Commonhouse Coffee (located in Squirrel Hill) for their espresso base, so I knew what to expect."}
{"text":"The service here is HORRENDOUS. If you want to be treated like a customer who pays for a service instead of being treated like a hinderance consider going pretty much anywhere else in Pittsburgh. My friends and I are from out of town and came here after dinner for some drinks and to watch the basketball game. It was fairly late, close to 11- I tried to order an iced tea from the coffee shop-- they said they were out of...ice? It's a bar and restaurant...do the owners not care that their waitstaff is losing them money? My friend asked if we could turn one of the TVs to the game and got a very rude NO. Then my friends ordered a drink OFF THE MENU and were given the run around by their excuse for a bartender for 5 minutes before being told no. Then when we were sitting there were just watching the staff close down the patio...at 11....3 hours before they close. Again, these owners must not be concerned with making money because we would have easily spent $150 as a group of pretty hard drinkers. But we had one drink and left."}
{"text":"The Abbey is awesome. It just opened and I feel that it's going to do very well. The building is an old funeral home that they converted into a bar/restaurant/coffee shop and the space is massive. Renovations turned out beautifully and have created a warm, tasteful and comfortable ambiance, you definitely wouldn't know it was once a funeral home. There are at least two separate bars that I found, which helps bring the spaces together. Super happy to live so close and looking forward to coming here often.

I haven't had a chance to eat at The Abbey, but my friends say the food is delicious, and the coffee, too. My experience was at the bar where they had knowledgeable and friendly staff, a very wide selection of craft beers (most of them local, even better) and a pleasant/fun/yuppie crowd. We grabbed our drinks and wandered around, taking it all in. The lounge with the fireplace is perfect for chatting, and I can't wait to spend the summer in their gorgeous courtyard."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance on the patio, cool decor on the inside, nice looking coffee shop area. We went for brunch today for Father's Day. Mediocre food, they had a pulled pork taco station for brunch with pulled pork out of a package, and not even good packaged pulled pork. The 'apple cinnamon' to order waffle was just a apple cinnamon box mix. No apples, no cinnamon. No eggs at the breakfast buffet, you could order an omelette if you wanted though. The \"pierogies\" were canned biscuit dough with, well something, inside. Hostess was rude and gave us attitude for wanting to sit in a certain area outside (we had the first reservation of the day and there was not one table seated outside at this point). Only gave it two stars because our server was nice, not a good server; but you could tell she was trying, and the atmosphere was pleasant inside and out. I won't go back, too many great brunch spots in the city, but I hope they take their menu and choices more seriously. I mean steamed Brussels sprouts with no seasoning at all.. and no eggs at a breakfast buffet? Cmon Abbey, you can do better."}
{"text":"The story of a SIX DOLLARS and FIFTY CENTS
bowl of soup (curry chicken) ! in the cafe, so ordered at the counter (not a sit down lunch), served cold, and served with insults, but no baguette or even crackers.
Our dinner about a month ago, at The Abbey on Butler was underwhelming. The menu was VERY limited ( we did hear a comment about a kitchen problem that particular day), and the dining area's bar was VERY noisy. there is a bar at the entrance, and the folks at the dining area bar could easily have been accommodated there, making the dining area quiet enough to talk to our dinner companions and be heard.
Yesterday, i went into the cafe area at around 3, wanting a sandwich or soup.
My $6.50 bowl of soup was barely luke. More like room temperature. I ordered it at a counter, this was not table service for this price! I got up from my table, took it to the counter and the barista couldn't just zap it for a minute - she instead, took out a thermometer and proceeded to wait for the temp to register. While I waited, standing at the counter. And waited some more. She consulted with another staff member, and said that the soup was a few degrees below normal but that it would be fine for most people. I continued to wait at the counter until she decided to heat it a bit. SO, i'm spending a LOT of time standing at the counter, AND i'm being insulted that most people would accept a cold bowl of soup. 
Soup was served in a rimless bowl which is the type that needs a saucer under it ESPECIALLY since it has to be carried by the customer and a bowl with no  saucer under it  can be hot and dangerous to carry.  No saucer.  But no heat, so no problem for carrying, other than possible spills.  Not a crumb of a cracker or roll served with it for that high price.
 I did speak with a server, who was off the clock and intervened to try to make the situation better.  
He also kindly helped me get onto their wifi, after the restaurant's server didn't come up in settings.   However, it went off line almost immediately and again their wifi server  did not come up in settings.   I SHOULD have asked for an owner or manager, but the situation had turned into such a fail that I just wanted it to be over with.
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice ...... I won't be going back! and don't understand why anyone else would want to. (the soup was really good though and my margarita at dinner was one of the best i've ever had - and I\"m a Margarita Maven.) 
oh - and the advertised parking lot? very small (very disproportionate to the size of the restaurant) and hard to maneuver into - of course most Lawrenceville restaurants have NO parking lot, but if anyone mentions that the parking lot is a selling point, it shouldn't be."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio, but the Sunday brunch was ok.  Drinks the same.  I like the aesthetics of the place, but its all \"new trying to look old.\"  I'll go back to be outside and I like the coffees shop."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Not bad, but nothing to merit the huge fuss I'd heard about it from several people. 

The staff was a bit frosty to us initially regarding seating. They claimed that a number of their tables were set aside for reservations, but then seated other walk-ins, so I'm a bit suspicious on that count. 

Don't think I'd be especially eager to go back, but I'm sure this patio will be full in the summer. To me, there's a big difference in service, food and atmosphere between a restaurant that serves alcohol and a bar that serves food - this is #2."}
{"text":"Ok it was a little weird ... because I know I attended funerals here.  You would never know it was previously a funeral home.

Let's start with the front door ... it is a huge tube of coffee beans. 

The hostess will not seat you until your entire party has arrived.  That's OK because lots of seating at the well stocked bar.

We started with lots of appetizers.  The fried zucchini was literally 1 zucchini cut in half and half again ... HUGE spears served with a Wasabi sauce.  I had the pork tacos sans shells ... lots of flavor.  The bruschetta  was very good too. 

For dinner we had shrimp, pasta, and 2 dinner size salads.  Everyone would order their meals again.

I was the only person who ordered dessert.  It was a little cake with apricot preserves, whipped cream, and mint leaves ... it wasn't what I expected from the menu description but it satisfied my sweet tooth.

Lots of on street and parking lot spaces available.  We ate indoors but many took advantage of the summer weather on the large patio.

It had a small yet diverse menu to meet the dietary and preferences of everyone at the table.

Apparently they open at 6 am ish as a coffee shop and stay open all day transitioning into restaurant ....

Great concept .... good location.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Dude your hostess sucks, please retrain to learn how to handle customers. Who makes people wait 15 min to get seated when your entire restaurant is empty??"}
{"text":"The Abbey is un-arguably part of the wave of kind-of-expensive restaurants flooding Butler Street in the past couple of years, but it's one of few that really makes up for its price and crowd with amazing service and hugely-portioned, quality food. 

I'm not sure if they intend to have a British-inspired pub menu from now on, or if it rotates, but if you go while they have fish and chips or bangers and mash, I've loved both the handful of times I've been here, and had leftovers of both (which held up well the next day, even!).

The place itself is gorgeous and was the perfect place to bring my out-of-town parents and in-laws for dinner and drinks. They take reservations and have a ton of space, indoor and out."}
{"text":"This is a marvelous setting that is going to need a little bit of footwork to find its niche. The vision is there, but now some real choices should be made (the black-and-white movies is an excellent first step). 

If I were them, I'd take a look at other spots that mix these things (Agora in Houston is my absolute favorite. That place burned to the ground and the demand was such that they were back up and running very quickly. Or, the beautiful coffee shops along the Pacific Coast in California; or the heavily romantic bookstore-bars of Savannah). A sprawling yet intimate place, cloaked with a sense of history, has enormous potential.

I'm going to make some polite suggestions only because I want to see this place thrive. The menu is all over the place. There are a hundred faceless bar/restaurant hybrids with yet another over-priced \"Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese.\" I don't want to pay 9 dollars for a grilled cheese that devours the beauty and simplicity inherent in the reassuring sandwich. Other dishes have similar problems.

I'd try to do something in keeping with the atmosphere: simpler food, but better sourced. Maybe even take a look at some traditional monastery cookbooks (those can be so great: there's a place in Maine run by Franciscan Friars. Simple, beautiful, inexpensive, and everything food is meant to be without being inaccessible). Cheeses, breads, soups, clotted cream and seasonal, local fruit. There are all sorts of farms near-by; it could be a great partnership. For heavier meals, ethnic Scandinavian, British, or Polish food? That would be in keeping with the vibe; plus, all the excellent Polish food in this city really seems to come from church basements. A place that did more than fried pierogis with a side of extra-fried fries would be spectacular.

The staff is nice but confused. Visibly confused, and that will turn people away before they even step inside. There should be meetings, training, and clear, articulated purpose. If the manager is doing too much, with bar, restaurant, and coffee, there needs to be a general supervisor, and they should be brisk and experienced.

Finally, a bit more of an identity. This place has made so many good first choices, but then kind of trails off. What about seizing the neighborhood library trend and lining the walls in one room with books? What about hanging local art, or seeing what you can gather from Sacred Heart Store (it is called The Abbey, after all). Instead of generic black-leather-and-metal decor, what about salvaging old velvet chairs and sofas? Wooden tables? They would go beautifully with the decor. Growing vines or roses to shield diners from Butler Street traffic? The fountain is beautiful; keep it going.

This is very presumptuous for a review. But I haven't found anything in Pittsburgh quite like this and it won me over. I think narrowing the focus and tightening the vision would be immensely beneficial, and I want you guys to do well. I'll keep visiting, with a very curious eye! Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Spent no less than 140 dollars as a table then after 2 people left we're forced to order food. We ordered food then still forced out of our patio seating. There are still 5- 2 tops open and 2- 4 tops available. Unsure why we were still forced out of seating, not to mention that it was rudely done with no apologies nor thank yous."}
{"text":"Came in here on a cold cold sunday morning for quick coffee.. Decent coffee.. They open at 7AM which is a big plus on butler!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation, and, upon arriving, told the hostess our name. She checked her list and proceeded to seat us at a table basically in the waitress station. When we asked for a different table, she moved us to one pretty much in the kitchen hallway. When we asked her about al the other better, empty tables, she said that they were reserved for people who made reservations. Excuse me? Who are we? A couple of bums off the street? BTW - those tables never were used.

Also - don't order the Shepherd's Pie. It's basically a bowl of lamb grease served in a iron bowl at about 400 degrees. Once it cooled down (and that took 20 minutes) it was disgusting.

Really really bad"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed by the arbitrary rules about where you can sit. We were told that we couldn't sit outside because only one member of our party was eating food despite the entire outside being empty at 7pm on a Tuesday. Our friend who wanted food in the same establishment was told he couldn't order it because we were forced to sit inside. If you're trying to have an enjoyable experience, don't come here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I wanted to even give it one star. Didn't have a good selection of scotch! The bartender wanted to debate American oak scotch (much different profile than sherry or port cask aging). Not one spyelside in sight! Then they  crammed a large group in a booth for four.    The appetizer the chicken dip tasted like canned devilwood chicken with sirachia sauce.
Very, very limited menu, I had burger my wife had Mac and cheese. Both horrible! Burgers I have had a red robin were 1000% better than the frozen over cooked thing that I had. The Mac and cheese was well not good at all. After we left we stopped for something to eat. 

If you want a good burger go to Tessaro's!

Also $14 for a 2 oz wine!

Noise level beyond the roar of a jet engine!"}
{"text":"I am a little hesitant to review after one visit, and on opening week...but I'm going to.  

This is a solid place, but unfortunately it is surrounded by superior places (Vandal, Cure, Piccolo Forno etc...) It is pretty cool looking, but the unique concept seems to cover up the \"a'ight\" food.  We ordered a round of appetizers, tempura zucchini, chicken skewers, and grilled shrimp.  *UGLY AMERICAN COMMENT ALERT...the portions were a bit small given the price point.  I wasn't looking to throw a few pounds on the fast track to the 'betes, but I was kind of hungry afterwards.  Also enjoyed cocktails, but they were just average.  

The service was fine, but they seemed a little confused at handling the outside service.  I am okay with this, since this it was the first week.  I have to say again, the restaurant LOOKS great, but Great restaurants don't need a ton of atmosphere to succeed (Cure is basically in a   cabin in a building that looks dilapidated on the outside).  You could probably argue that it is a little confused of a concept, as the coffee house seems a little unnecessary and could potentially clash with the rest of the restaurant/bar area.  I will probably try to go back, but nothing is hooking me yet, and therefore won't be in a rush.  I may go for coffee sometime though.   Let's hope they get that extra push with the food as the chef gets a little more adventurous.

The fact that they do have parking certainly helps in Lawrenceville.  I sincerely hope they enforce it for customer's only, because they paid for the space and it should go to supporting their business

IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Sublime.  Their music was okay (I never dug it, but I understood their appeal to a select few), but they got some unwarranted props as a whole because the lead singer died and you can't speak ill of the dead."}
{"text":"Treated so rudely by our server, who insisted on knowing what we planned to order before seating us on the patio. One of our five person group just wanted to sit in the sunshine for a moment, and our heinous server practically grabbed the guy's arm to make him sit at the table that was set for us. 

There was only one other table sat on a 20+ table dining area so it wasn't busy, and it's a freakin' Monday. Four times, he was enforcing the \"rules\" of the restaurant, that we MUST be seated at our table. After the final insult, we got up and left. This place is run by stressed out, tyrant-led jerks. 

I will never go to Abbey again.

Instead, spent $175 at Industry and had a great, chill experience.

I hope someone cool can manage this place in the future  I understand how difficult it must be to try to meet the needs of daters, workers, spenders, etc. And allow for the right people in the right micro-venues in their space. But you don't have to be so rude about it."}
{"text":"I like sitting at the bar, so that is exactly what I did. Bartenders were attentive. Beer selection is pretty good - tends to gravitate more toward IPAs and ales but something for everyone. 

Prices for beer are average (compared to other places) and for food, prices also range from average to a little pricier. I had the provolone burger (good) with the house pasta salad (a little too al dente). 

What made this experience for me was the music. Funk soul Motown on a Sunday night. I don't know if that's the usual since it was my first time going but ... Perfect."}
{"text":"Sunny Sunday Brunch: Overall Fair -3.5 stars

Atmosphere: Nice decor as others have described. Coffeehouse, Bar, Restaurant and outdoor seating. We sat on the patio which was nice and chill - but we arrived before 11:00am.

Menu: Mostly geared toward the buffet with a few ala carte. Had the buffet (with omelet and pumpkin waffle option from the kitchen). Buffet had standard breakfast food, build you own fajita, brussel sprouts, perogies, etc. Partner enjoyed his chicken and waffles entree.  Nothing mind blowing but decent/satisfying for brunch. Not many vegan options. Cost $18.00 for brunch buffet.  Oh my coffee was pretty tasty!

Service: Pretty good. We were seated promptly, food arrived within 15-20 min and server was pleasant. 

Overall, I would return for a casual Sunday brunch and probably try a happy hour since the place is so cute!"}
{"text":"One of the best patio in city for sure. But i cant say same thing for food quality. We had dinner I ordered shepperd which was okay. And then I went to bar section after my dinner. It was exactly 9:55 and that guy told me he closed espresso when i asked latte. And he was weird. He is like we close at 10 im like its not 10 yet. Not cool"}
{"text":"The Abbey... the long awaited bar finally opened in Lawrenceville. It's just a stones throw from the apartment I live in, so I've been dying for this place to finally open. I peeked in during construction, which was breathtaking. Happy to see it's finally finished and just as gorgeous as I imagined it would be. 
The drinks are great!  I had the Butler Mule and a few other cocktails of which the names escape me. Everything tasted good. The butler mule is like an Irish (or Dublin) mule without the bitters.  I think it would be PERFECT with a dash of bitters, but that's my personal preference. (Sorry I'm always a bartender at heart)
We eventually got a table and ordered some food.
Appetizer was the fried green tomatoes with a balsamic sauce, they were very good. Slightly small portions but that never bothers me much. There were three slices of tomato, breaded, fried, and drizzled. For dinner we all ordered steak. Here's where I have a bit of an issue, not much but a bit...
My steak was a tad overdone, and perhaps that's on me for ordering medium-rare. My boyfriend ordered rare. My sister ordered medium. The boyfriends steak was more medium rare, my steak was bordering on medium/medium-well. It tasted great and wasn't a huge deal breaker. I suppose we should have asked prices, as the steaks were the special and the waiter seemed a little flustered and we didn't want to make him feel more so. He did a great job reading the specials, and seemed a little bit nervous but that was endearing. The slight overcook on the steak aside... everything tasted very good. 
I look forward to coming for brunch! 
I can't wait to try more things on the menu! (Sriracha Chicken Dip I'm looking at you!!!).

I have a few friends that also work there, which is even more incentive to return!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Very busy took a while to get noticed at a table by the bar. Wasn't impressed by brunch. Buffet looked good but too pricey. No high chairs for kids. Will go back to try dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great place and great food! Dined with a group of workers for lunch. Nice place for groups. Large selection of craft beers and the food was memorable. All of us enjoyed the same entree: chicken gouda sandwich with fries, slaw or vegetable side. It recommended by the waitress and it was a great choice. The sandwich was flavorful and had a delicious spread on it. The coffee bar was a surprise. We split a cookie among the six of us. It was by far one of the best chocolate chip cookies that I have eaten. Beautiful mysterious decor which I later understood the mysterious because it used to be a funeral parlor. The space is full of decorative surprises including an old organ, door with a wine cork handle, large wooden doors and a patio that makes you feel at home. Nice fountain and brick columns. It's perfect on a nice day."}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere, great drink options. Outdoor song is amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"(Review for the Coffeehouse)
I got the medio dia Guatemalan coffee on pour over ($3.50). The beans from Commonplace never disappoint :). There was even some extra coffee that the barista gave in an extra cup because it didn't all fit in the mug. They sell pastries here too. (They sell a coffee + kahlua creme brûlée. Will have to try that next time!)

Nice vibes here, great for getting work and/or studying done. Free wifi. It is quite spacious with a mix of tables and comfy couches. Not many outlets from what I saw, so come with a charged laptop or get the seats near the outlets. It was pretty chilly in the room to the left from their AC right above us, but I guess that made me more productive in a way.. It's not too loud or too quiet here, but around 5:00 it started to get a little loud because of happy hour starting. I'd return to try out their restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Came here for a Tuesday dinner, awesome atmosphere and they make my favorite drink!  I got the backyard burger and it was very tasty.   Would definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"So having once lived in the city, then moving north about 40 miles .... One learns to cherish their city moments when they get them.  This past Sunday at The Abbey was one of those times, and the Abby did not disappoint in the slightest.  My wife and I met friends for brunch.  Our first choice was packed so our friends suggested The Abbey.  Their brunch buffet is remarkable, and the Bloody Mary bar is equally as impressive.  It was perfect.  Exactly what we needed.  I'm pretty confident the next time the call for brunch arises ... The Abbey will be first on our list for a re-visit.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The abbey is one of those unfortunate places that will not seat you unless your whole party is there... even if you are one of 4 people in the whole restaurant, because heaven forbid 500 other people show up and have no place to sit while you are waiting for your last person to arrive... Ummm ok anyways

The food here is good, the veggie burger was surprisingly good. They have a decent beer selection too. I would go back, but I have friends that are always late so I probably actually won't."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and although I love the atmosphere and two bars, one for coffee and one for alcohol, I found the menu and service to be lackluster. I ordered fish and chips which was good, but not spectacular. Our service was very slow and it seemed we were forgotten from time to time. It's worth checking out for the atmosphere, but know ahead of time to check out the menu!"}
{"text":"It's rare to find a coffee shop/bar combo...and maybe that's a good thing. It's hard enough to pull off one, vs both at the same time. This is a good example.

The coffee half is adequate at best, however the dark comfy ambiance will keep u subdued.

The food is nothing special, at all. Menu is more hit or miss than when ur pitcher is up to bat...mostly missing.

They get two stars ...1 for ambiance...1 for the cute bartender who comped me the gag inducing crab chowder she acutely noticed I only took one bite of."}
{"text":"I'm actually quite terse in my reviews.

The chicken was delicious.  I never eat the skin.  I ate it all at The Abbey. 

The mashed potatoes tasted quite home-made and the carrots were cooked al dente, just as I love them.  

The service was friendly and caring and efficient and I felt as if they genuinely appreciated my business.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable comfort food, affordable drinks, friendly atmosphere, great service. The building has incredible character. The fall festival with art vendors and live music was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a hot summer afternoon, and grabbed a cold drink from the cafe. It's a pleasant environment including a bar and restaurant as well. This seems like a good spot regardless of what time of day you're there. I hope to be back to try the food."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. I LOVE the backyard burger. Seriously one of the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life. The first time I went here was during the week and we had no problem getting a table. The second time I went was yesterday (Friday night). Apparently you need reservations on the weekend. No problem though, there were plenty of tables in the bar area for us to enjoy dinner. We still received great service in the bar area, staff was friendly and my food was so good. Another bonus about this place is they have 2 parking lots. A rare thing to find in Lawrenceville. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's not even 9:00 pm.  Wanted to sit on the patio.  They are shutting it down.  Weather is great.   Makes no sense.  They just don't want to serve on the patio.   Will never come back."}
{"text":"The Pinot noir sangria will bring a tear to your eye. The food was excellent, but the sangria is really the belle of the ball here. 

Great ambiance. A little loud, but that's to be expected.

Monte Cristo is delicious too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this place for dinner or happy hour, but our most recent trip for brunch was one of the most disappointing experiences we've had at a restaurant in Lawrenceville/ Pittsburgh.
To be fair, we did not call ahead so we sat at the bar.  We've done this for dinner before and have always had decent experiences, so we thought this would be okay.  But they only had ONE bartender/server working.  To her credit, she busted her butt to get things done.  But it took 45 minutes just for us to get drinks from anyone in the establishment- and they got them wrong.  If a restaurant is going to pride itself on brunch, have more than one person tending bar. 
Secondly, we arrived when brunch still had two hours left- and there was NO food at the buffet.  There were probably ten or so pans of food in the buffet area and only four with remnants of food.  Out of everything, we were able to eat some sad, leftover pineapple from the fruit salad, a smushed perogi, and a hard biscuit.   Not what I expect when paying $18.00/person. 
It's going to take awhile to get us back there.  Step it up, Abbey."}
{"text":"Excellent service, prices and food. Highly recommend for a night out on the town. Very relaxed inside and out."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most unique places I've been in Pittsburgh! It's an eclectic combination of bar, restaurant, and coffee bar, all with the own distinct areas and vibe. I went and enjoyed a coffee to start, then moved on to their bar where I tapped into their amazing selection of brews on tap. We sat and talked in a quite nook next to one of their many outdoor lanterns. Such an awesome evening at The Abby! The staff was outstanding! Excellence choice of sour and other specialty beers, they even have a ton of coffee and tea alcohol drinks. Great place to spend an evening, check them out!"}
{"text":"Great concept, really rusty execution.  Based on my two experiences here, and reading your reviews, whoever owns this place should hire someone really competent to run the front of the house operation, train your waitstaff to be kind (we are in the midwest for god's sake) and ensure that patrons (and staff) are happy to be there."}
{"text":"Worst smelling men's bathroom in Pittsburgh. get that fixed and I'll change this review because its fun but this bathroom smells worst than a locker room."}
{"text":"I spent a few hours at The Abbey this week for a work meeting and it was the perfect spot for the two of us! We started our morning in the coffee shop with iced coffee and a raspberry crumb bar. The coffee was wonderful and while the crumb bar tasted delicious, it was a little too sweet for my 8AM preference. That said, I'd probably get it again - just not as breakfast! The coffeeshop section of The Abbey is cozy, the staff is friendly and the wifi is fast - a great choice for a meeting or if you need a few hours of work time outside of the office."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times at this point. The coffee is great, and the male barista (baristo?) seems to have it under control every time I see him, even at 9am singlehandedly making drinks for a line of customers.

That being said, my experience with the bar was less impressive. I ordered a cocktail, which was tasty, but I felt literally nothing after drinking it... If I'm going to pay $9 for a cocktail, I expect it to contain enough alcohol to at least have some effect.

I'll be going back often for coffee, but it's unlikely I'll bother with the bar again."}
{"text":"Nobody should ever have stress associated with going out for dinner/drinks. Some cust bartendress in back was unwarrantedly rude and petty, which was unfortunate. 

Otherwise, nice interior. Cool design and concept. The coffee bar guy is always friendly. The front bar gets packed when many people cram into it. But understandable given the cool vibe of the place. 

The initial visit I had was good. But this most recent interaction brought down my thoughts on the place some."}
{"text":"First, the good- The servers and staff are helpful and friendly. The space itself is large so I can't imagine seating will ever be an issue and there is a big outdoor space (huge bonus). Now, the bad- Went here for brunch. The only option currently is an $18 brunch buffet that includes an alcoholic beverage. The buffet included your typical french toast, eggs, bacon, steak, pastries, etc. It reminded me of bad cruise food. I was completely underwhelmed. I am not sure how their brunch is going to survive with so many other delicious options nearby. 

I might come back here for a beverage but  I will not be coming here to eat again."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at the Abbey. The service has always been prompt and the food has always been freshly prepared and delicious. But what you really come here for is the atmosphere.

The Abbey succeeds in creating an upscale English-style pub, complete with a dining room, cafe, cozy sitting room, and breathtaking outdoor patio with a large fountain in the summer. It's a crazy mash-up of three different facilities that somehow just works.

When you walk in you step directly into a small foyer that leads to the bar, which feels like a dark, warm and cozy pub. There are typical bar-top tables and chairs as well as a small window nook to the right  that has lower seating. On your left  is a wall of frosted glass with inset doors. Step through them and enter into the cafe's sitting room, with a large fire in the antique fireplace crackling away, and several lowslung leather chaises and sofas to rest in. Framing the fireplace are french doors out onto the patio, where a grand fountain spouts elegant water displays in the summer while your brunch outdoors. At the far end of the room is the cafe's ordering counter, which has a large, heavy round cathedral window as its chandelier. At the back of the cafe and pub area is the dining room/bistro, where you can make reservations and wait to be seated. It wraps around the closed kitchen and has a secondary bar and additional booth seating reminiscent of pub-style eateries. High on the walls wrapping around the building are the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody, and every room is cast in a soft orange glow.

Now that you are warm and comfortable, enjoy a wide variety of dark and rich drafts, from smooth IPAs to nitro milk stouts. Then order the filling beer-battered chicken and mashed potatoes or bangers and mash. In the mood for something lighter? Get a specialty mixed drink like their \"Bohemian Raspberry\" or summer sangria alongside a salmon salad or grilled shrimp and rosemary bean starter. Every dish I've eaten there takes the traditional (like fish and chips) and adds a twist, whether it be a coffee rub, a curry sauce, or a sweet and sour spread.

The Abbey is one of my favorite places to hang out in Pittsburgh, hands down. If you haven't been there yet you are missing out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the city. The inside is a retro speak easy type of vibe since it use to be a funeral home. They have a coffee bar and sitting area, a pub style bar, restaurant sitting area and an outdoor sitting area with a fountain. The food is excellent and the coffee is really good."}
{"text":"We've gone here multiple times as we live right up the street, so this review is based on a summary rather than one experience. 

The patio is amazing. I love coming here to drink at all times of the day and their food is incredible. Pro tip: the Mac and cheese is the best thing on the menu. You may have a heart attack after eating it, but it's worth it. 

The service leaves something to be desired. They always seem to be understaffed on servers, but will have 2-3 hostess' at the podium. Don't know why that's necessary. A handful of times that I've been here the food has come out before a drink, which is odd. 

The only other thing that I don't like about this place is that the entire staff is kind of pretentious. It's a really nice space, but they talk to you like you just entered a fancy restaurant in downtown rather than Lawrenceville where the clientele is mostly young and casual. 

They also have very strict rules about drinking on the patio and you are not allowed to have a table unless you're also ordering food, so you're limited to one couch and 2 high top tables if you're just going for drinks. No service to the outside for drinks either. 

All in all, I will definitely continue going here and hope that the service issue will get better over time."}
{"text":"Food wasn't what I expected. Really heavy, and extremely overcooked. Service wasn't all that great either. This was a one and done"}
{"text":"I stopped into grab a drink before dinner.  When I mean drink, I mean beer.  They have a diverse list of beers, from all over with a focus on the locals.  Seasonal and the staples.  (And Miller Lite for the not-so-adventurous beer drinker) 

The atmosphere is what I was caught up in.  So the first thing that you need to do is just get over the fact that this is an old funeral home.  It is all in your head, because the atmosphere and decor do not ring \"funeral home\".  A little dark, a little hip.  There was some dreamy Lana del Rey tune playing in the back ground.   The coffee shop was packed with people on their Macbooks, and the bar had a small happy hour crowd.  I am definitely going to stop in for brunch soon.  (It starts Saturday April 16, 2016)  They open early and have breakfast on Saturdays.  Two of my things... 


Oh and another one if my go-tos is corn.  I love any place that has grilled corn on the menu. (See Happy Valley Brewing Company review)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Greeted by a friendly host. Made a reservation which was a good thing as it was pretty busy for a Saturday and the place itself is not huge. They do have a beautiful large outdoor space but it's a little cold for that right now.

Ordered the curry fries (chips) and sriracha chicken dip with naan. Both were awesome and the portions great for sharing. 

Hubby and I also both ordered entrees. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but I'm glad we got to try so much. Hubby got the steak and said it was delicious, I got the Mac and cheese with fried chicken. All perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful. We literally had no room and ended up taking a lot home. 

Price was reasonable, ambiance is super cozy. Would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Abbey after dinner on a Saturday evening.  First timer and I was impressed by the roominess of the establishment.  Of course this was before I found out that the Abbey was previously a funeral home.  It still has a funeral home type layout, so incredibly roomy which is something most places in Lawrenceville lack.  

We secured a spot at the bar within a few minutes of waiting, and attempted to order drinks.  I can't recall what I asked for but the bartender said, it's kicked.  Ok how about, it's kicked.  This was an ongoing theme of the night.  I can't recall what I ended up going with but by the end of the first drink that also had been kicked.  Feeling deterred from ordering another beer I went to the cocktail list.  At least that should be available.   I ordered a Butler Mule.  It was made well and I was satisfied.  The atmosphere is really beautiful, and as mentioned the space makes the Abbey really unique.  They have different sections, and an outdoor area that would probably be great in the warmer months.  We checked out their food menu just to see what they offer and were pretty interested in coming back for some food.  They offer a brunch which normally excites me a lot, but this is buffet style.  Buffet style never excites me.  However the lunch menu looked great, so maybe some lunch on a Saturday with cocktails and I will make believe it is brunch.   Good stop for a drink, can't wait to try the food."}
{"text":"It's really a shame. They have all the makings of a decent, even incredible spot. The Abbey made a major misstep and opted to invest all of their tremendous budget on the renovation and clearly not into a menu.  The deep fried zucchini is like what teenager would make if gave them a deep fryer.

Their servers do not know what their bar or cafe has to offer, waiters seem to forget tables while the manger smoozes the tables with scripted questions rotating uncomfortably between tables. I didn't offer my honest opinion with my first brunch visit here. (I've had better complementary motel brunches.) I was shocked the brunch it served in hot plates and there is no menu just help yourself.  I hope they get it together.  

The stars this place gets is for its top notch bar tenders and barista who should be running the show. The food is subpar and I've given this place three shotsLots of potential, not clear vision. 

Good coffee, good bar. Food is a fail. Service is lacking."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here with 3 friends. Two of us ordered lattes and they came out luke warm. My friend sent hers back but I didn't feel comfortable doing the same. I thought it was a bit silly the 4 of us had to share 2 menus. They weren't even that busy. Although the buffet looked really good, I ordered off the menu because I have some food allergies. They accommodated my needs and my food was fine. I was hoping for more exciting experience here, but I'll give it another go in the future."}
{"text":"A deconstructed funeral home repurposed restaurant surprisingly resurrected our interest to try this place. 

Seriously, we were impressed with both our selections and the redesign of the building.

We had the crab and corn cakes and the Shrimp Cobb salad. Both very tasty.

We sat on the lovely patio near the fountain. Service was friendly and efficient. We would go back, abbeysolutely!"}
{"text":"Another new restaurant, and it's another winner, too. The Abbey is versatile: it's a coffee bar, it's a wine bar, and it's a restaurant. 

I tried their brunch today, and it was impressive. On the plus side, the food was delicious and the service was very good. We felt lucky to sit outside on the patio, where there is a picturesque fountain.  I was surprised at the marvelous options for vegetarians, they served a delicious veggie gravy and also a savory cardamom mango compote. 

The price is $18, which seems a bit expensive. Coffee and juice are free, but specialty drinks are extra. 

My main criticism is the orange juice that was a typical bar orange juice, I was expecting something fresh squeezed, or at the very least something not-from-concentrate.

I enjoyed the ambiance, eating here is a special occasion."}
{"text":"I tried the Abbey for drinks with a friend last night, and overall it was a really positive experience. I walked in and the friendly host let me know that the bar area was self-seating and that we could order at the bar if we chose one of the nearby high top tables. I decided on that, and the ordering process was smooth overall. I was always able to quickly get the bartender's attention for drink refills, and when I ordered some fries someone brought them right to the table. If you opt to be seated in the dining room, that comes with full table service. 

The bar area itself got a bit noisy due to some rather raucous middle-aged patrons (I pray for that much energy once I'm their age!) so in the future I'll probably seek out the couches in the quieter lounge space on the other side of the wall. That was my only quibble however, and with how large the building appears to be I'm sure there are plenty of places to camp out with drinks and relax. I can't extensively comment on the food, but I may increase this to a 5-star review if it turns out to taste as great as it looked and smelled. One final note: The draft list was wonderful! There were lots of excellent choices and flights were only $8, which will keep me coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow they have some great apps! My son mean mugged the staff the whole time and they were great sports about it. It was a nice dinner with my girlfriends and we had a good time. They even had some jazz music live when we were leaving."}
{"text":"New favorite brunch spot!! The restaurant is also a bar and a coffee shop. This building has a lot of history in there. They have a ceiling light that was made from a window from a historical building, and It looks great in the coffee shop area. We were lucky the weather was nice on that Sunday so we decide to sit outside. Their brunch menu looks looks amazing and we ended up picked fried chicken and waffle, the lamp and gravy, and the beet salad. We loved everything but I think my favorite dish was the lamb and gravy. The lamb sausage has a charcoal taste and to eat with the gravy, it was Perfectly delicious. I would definitely bring friends over for brunch maybe check out their lunch or dinner menu at some other days as well. Their coffee shop area looks very comfortable, unlike other coffee shops that you can only sit on hard chairs but they have couple leather chairs, leather couch, they look very comfortable. I can see myself sitting on those couch reading a book or just enjoy a cup of coffee here."}
{"text":"First time in here and love it! Great beer selection, fun atmosphere and good food. Try the fall sangria."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try some cocktails, so I can't comment on the food but the dishes that passed by me (especially the burger with pork rinds instead of fries) looked delicious. I think this place opened less than a week ago, so service is, as expected, working out a good flow. The front bar was very crowded as it was a Friday night and good news in lawrenceville travels fast

The building used to be a funeral home, and they kept the internal layout it seems. There are several big rooms and little nooks scattered throughout. The decor is lovely, very rustic, but I'm a little confused by the layout and concept. The front two rooms contain one full bar with bar tables and across the hallway is a \"coffee shop\" with espresso drinks and pastries. The back room is another full bar. Dining tables with full waiter service are scattered through the two bar rooms, which is a little strange. For one, both rooms are really loud because people are standing around drinking. Second, the waiting staff seemed to be running around somewhat frantic through the crowds because it's a lot of space to cover. You can order food at the bars, too, but there are very few bar tables/seats for you to eat at.

Overall, kind of confusing place with a lot going on at once... Again it was Friday night so maybe it was more crowded than usual with people there just for drinks? Regardless I wouldn't want to be competing with bar noise during my meal and it's too loud to be a coffee place. I think with time they'll better define spaces, improve efficiency, and layout. I think they're trying to do a lot at once, which is admirable, and the cocktails ($10) were good, but not perfected yet (try acacia if craft cocktails are your thing). I'll be back to try some food, probably on a weekday."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try The Abbey for Sunday brunch. Looks like a really cool spot. Unfortunately, the hostess let us know they do not have any high-chairs. So, our family of 3 were told \"so, so sorry.\" If you're a family that needs a seat for your little one... this spot is not an option."}
{"text":"This former funeral home is beautiful and dimly lit. It is directly across the street from Allegheny Cemetery, which gives great creepy goth vibes. 

As a restaurant, this place is okay. The salads are fresh and have a good ratio of texture and flavor. The lunch items are heavy on bread, so you'll need to choose carefully to not be hungry again soon.

I absolutely love the cafe. The lattes are HUGE and only $3.50! Each one has cute latte art on top that looks like a fern frond. And the sweets are dense and decadent. Try the squishy apricot loaf, it's super moist and sticky. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to get work done, and also enough space for a small group to have a semiprivate meeting place. 

The Abbey is easily accessible by bike and bus, and there is plenty of free street parking and a small lot."}
{"text":"Disorganized and very poor service.  Went to set outside and were told we had to get up and go speak with the hostess, she told us we can just order drinks at the bar and sit on couches.  The outside seating area was completely empty. When we told here we wanted a table and to order food she insisted we can just order at the bar.  No one here has any clue what is going on. Bar service was very slow and they seemed to only serve people they knew."}
{"text":"The team behind the Abbey has done an amazing job renovating this old funeral home into a beautiful restaurant full of intimate nooks where you and your friends can gather for a beer, coffee, or dinner. They also have the best patio in Lawrenceville, perfect for summer nights. 

While the bar has a broad selections of beers and cocktails the food menu is strange and lacking in options. The menu is weighted heavy towards appetizers and small plates while leaving your entre selections limited to 2 burgers or 3 heavy/creamy pastas. I couldn't tell if they are going for a tapas style situation here or what the reason is for such a limited menu. I'd love to see another sandwich option or two and something like a chicken/pork chop/fish entre, especially during the summer months...I'm not looking for buttery pasta when its 80+ outside. 

I'll definitely be back and hopefully they expand the menu and take advantage of this beautiful space."}
{"text":"They have the worst bartenders.  My 3 girlfriends and I went there to get some drinks before dinner. We order wine and only got about 4 sips in our wine glass. By the time the bartender came back with the checks we were almost done. The bartender asked if we wanted separate check and we said yes. When the checks came I forgot that I owed my friend money so I said give me yours and I'll pay for both of ours. The bartender then came back with our paid bill and said put your hands out to me and my friend. He then slaps our hands and said I'm too busy for this sh*t. Really, that's how you treat customers???  Never going back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Abby many times because I am in Lawrenceville all the time. I've been there for breakfast/coffee in the morning, I've been there for lunch, and I've been there for dinner, so I've tried every day part.  Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is dreadful, but it is convenient. We met some friends there yesterday and it was terrible. It started out with me asking for ice tea for my drink and the server told me they didn't have any iced tea because they didn't have any tea bags (which I thought was odd since they have a whole coffee bar there). So my second choice was a ginger ale. I was served a room temperature, flat soda, so I asked if I could get a new one with ice and it was \"no problem.\"  I was going to order the salad I usually get for dinner (the Southwest St. Mary's with grilled shimp) and was told that it's only on the lunch menu. They have a new menu and it was after lunch so this salad is not an option for dinner. I mean, how hard is it to make a Cobb salad? So I opted for the veggie burger. It was okay. The pasta salad that came with it didn't have much flavor to it. If it wasn't for the friends we met there and the good company, I would have been kind of upset over this meal and the service. Maybe they were having an off day. But with all the choices that Lawrenceville is now offering, they should tighten their ship."}
{"text":"I hosted a going away happy hour at the Abbey last Thurs. for a group of my friends.  I chose the Abbey as the location because it encompasses a bar, a restaurant, and a coffee bar, and therefore is capable of satisfying a variety of tastes.  Additionally, it is quite large and has a lot of seating, including a pleasant-looking outdoor seating area, so I figured it could easily accommodate my group regardless of how many people ended up showing up.

Because the Abbey doesn't accept reservations, I arrived at the beginning of my event with a couple of guests and explained the situation to them.  The hostess told me that they normally wait for the entire group to show, but because my guests would be filing in and out over the course of two hours, she had us hang out at the bar while she prepared a table for us.  The table that we ended up at was between the bar and the foyer, and we didn't have consistent waitservice during our visit, but it did allow guests to come and go easily, which was nice.

For my drink, I ordered a prosecco, which was $1 off for happy hour ($7).  It was exactly what i expected--nothing too out of the ordinary, just a basic dry wine-like alcoholic beverage.  As a snack, I ordered the Yukon gold smashed potatoes ($7), which were miniature potato cakes topped with cheese and a garnish of aromatic green herbs.  They were rather bland to the point that I requested salt and pepper to impart some flavor to them.  Like the beverage, they weren't bad, but were nothing too special.

My other guests ordered a variety of drinks and food, including beer, cider, and cocktails as well as burgers and other small plates.  I can't comment on them because I didn't try them, but my guests didn't complain but didn't rave, either.

Based on my experience, I'd say that the Abbey is an A-OK spot to host a happy hour or other informal gathering.  The service was sporadic and the food was okay, but the setting was nice and offered something for everyone.  At the time of our visit, we were unable to take advantage of the outdoor seating because of rainy weather, but it looked like it'd be nice if weather permits.  The Abbey offers a welcome alternative to the many loud bars on Butler St. such as Industry, so be sure to check it out with your group.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"What a neato restaurant and bar.

It's a beautiful old building with a lounge with couches and wifi, an outdoor patio, fireplaces, and bars.

The theme is modern chic medieval.
Lawrenceville and this district are generally artsy and creative.

The menu was small but had and Irish pub kind of feel.

I sat outside on the beautiful patio in a cozy nook with pillows. 

I decided to take a health risk and get the super cheesy macaroni and cheese with fried chicken. My friendly server and I joked about how this would be a good last meal.

The dinner was good. The macaroni was bacon-y the chicken was good and the atmosphere was awesome. I would like to return maybe for their brunch."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would ever go back here. 

We had a table for 10 outside starting at around 9pm for a friends very lowkey birthday. Around 10pm 2 more friends showed up and we asked for 2 more chairs to fit around the table which had plenty of room. The manager Bob or Rob, came up to us and said he would not be giving us any more chairs and our friends were not welcome to stand around the table ether. At this point it was 10pm and 3 2top tables were next to us so our 2 friends sat down at one of those within 10min Bob was back and asked me if the gentleman and lady at that table were with us(instead of asking them directly), and that he needed that table back because he was on a wait. We begrudgingly gave the table back because we had a feeling he was not on a wait and lone behold he was lying not 1 person sat down at those tables the rest of the night.  

Moral of this story is I understand Bob did not want us having 2 more people join our party but the way he went about it was just completely unnecessary. This is clearly a restaurant that was renovated by someone with money but no real restaurant experience. No one in FOH seemed to know what the hell they were doing and were some of the most unaccommodating people I have ever met. I tried this restaurant its first week and it was awful(the food and the service) and this just sealed for me I will never go back, I would rather spend my money at Wendy's down the street than The Abbey."}
{"text":"Just checked it out for the first time. Went around 9 on a Thursday night to grab a drink. They were very welcoming and when we saw the bar was full they told us about another bar in the back. My friend and I loved the dark lighting and it wasn't too loud to have a quiet conversation. We enjoyed the house wine and chicken dip with naan. It was spicy and addicting. We will definitely be back to try more food and drink, especially on a warm night to sit out on the patio. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great place to study and work during the day, the place is huge with cosy couches, fireplaces and friendly staff.  They have an excellent weekend brunch and I am looking forward to coming here for dinner one of these nights."}
{"text":"Bar Side: lots of tables and space for small/medium groups. We have celebrated birthdays here, met up with friends, and had date nights which all seemed to be suited by The Abbey! It's got a very cool looking exterior of an older fancy building but the inside has a very woodsy and polished look. Beer selection is great - they've also got TVs by the bar for those who want to watch games! 

Coffee shop: So cozy and comforting! I love meeting up with friends here for chatting or a pre-going out coffee. My only (small) quip is that  most times here, I received my coffee in a to go cup when I've been asked and specified a coffee for here. Very much not a big deal, but just something I noticed after a few times. They serve great coffee and espresso, but also offer some alcoholic dessert coffee drinks that look great! They also have a lot of snacks and pastries to enjoy while there. A great overall experience for the most part!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place! The staff seemed to be going through the motions, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Maybe it was just an off day. I had the Mac and Cheese and added on the fried chicken. I thought the mac and cheese was delicious and so creamy, but wasn't a fan of the chicken. The prices are affordable for the size you receive. I will definitely return to try other things on the menu. I also hear their coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"The physical space is awesome, just awesome. Lots of seating--bar, coffee-shop area, outdoor patio tables, coveted spots on the covered side patio,and indoor dining tables. It's a former funeral home, so think lots of dark wood, cool light fixtures, and a fireplace. Different rooms/areas offer different environments and perspectives. Really nice place to hang out.

The food is just entirely mediocre, whether we're talking bar snacks, dinner, or breakfast. For example, I have yet to order any kind of burger or meat at this place which isn't overcooked. At this point, I just never eat here by choice.

I would say that the staff aren't always the most welcoming. The bartenders can be aloof, there's a bit of pickiness around the seating areas (never been an issue for me, but I've witnessed multiple huffy customer interactions over this), and the baristas aren't particularly attentive (I've been handed the wrong drink order on multiple occasions, which is weird, 'cause I order some pretty basic stuff and don't mumble). Which. Honestly. It's fine. It's just not the kind of place where you feel a connection to anything or anyone. 

I do like the coffee-bar area--it's dark, but a nice place to sit and work. There aren't a ton of tables in the space, so depending on when you arrive, it can be a bit crowded. Decent outlet situation along the wall tables. The coffee drinks are serviceable. They do have some nice pastry options, usually.

All in all, the Abbey is a fun place to sit with friends over beer or coffee."}
{"text":"We went here for the weekend brunch. Avoid it at all costs. I'm not sure if it was because it was New Years Day or what but the food was really rough. There are far better places in Lawrenceville to spend $40 for brunch. The biscuits were hard as rocks and the rest of the food was very cold."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place every weekend instead of going to our comfortable regulars. This place will become a comfortable regular!  Hostesses we're so friendly; server was quiet but helpful; beer options were awesome; food was spectacular.
We started with the Sriracha chicken dip with naan. GET IT!  Then we had the mac and cheese with chicken and Sheppard's pie. Both entrees were beyond expectation and the mac and cheese provided a great leftover lunch!  
Combine all this with a really cool atmosphere and it makes a new favorite spot for us!"}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day dinner with my mom and had a fabulous time. Our server David was so lovely and accommodating - This certainly is not the best place in Lawrenceville for vegan options, but he was very careful to let me know what I could eat. We got the edamame hummus with veggies (the naan has butter), and I got the vegan burger over greens because the bun isn't vegan, which is labeled on their menu. Both were delicious! The dressing that came on the greens was fab and I didn't miss the carbs. David was also gracious about letting us sample wines because we are picky but we both found ones we liked. I have also come here just to drink at the bar and I love the ambiance and decor as well as the coffee cocktails. Anywhere that combines alcohol and caffeine is my kind of bar. Very cool place, always have a good time."}
{"text":"We are flexible and understanding to a busy restaurant.  Upon walking in to an empty podium and waiting for 15 minutes, the hostess who from this point forth will be known as \"the awful employee\" told us that tables were available they just had to be bused.  The awful employee then 20 minutes later said that the tables would not be able to be bused for 30-60 minutes because they are really busy. As this occurs the awful employee's coworkers lean lazily against the coffee bar. Anecdote if I am the hostess I am going to clear the tables myself. The awful employee then recommended sitting at the bar with a finger point.  We ask if we can push tables together to which the awful employee said yes. Shortly there after the awful employee complained our tables blocked the path. The awful employee never provides menus which we found on our own. Moral to the story she sucked and the management of the location was abysmal.  

Now to the positive:
-food: tasty. Sriracha dip was fantastic. 
-ambience: awesome and very nice
-bartender: he was fantastic and set up to fail. Probably managing 40 guests as a solo artist

More negative:
-3 waitresses attempted to serve plates we did not order 

In the end we can't wait to watch our soccer games and celebrate st patty's day when this place fails and reopens as an Irish pub."}
{"text":"This was a complete accident finding this but wow!! What a great surprise!
First of all the building is amazing! The artwork and the toon it self is like stepping back in time
Not only is the coffee incredible, but the also offer great drinks to go with it!
I had the boozy Abby manhatten with cold brew coffee brandy! Outstanding!
They also have lunch and snacks there that looked amazing and a great outdoor seating area right In the heart of Larry-ville!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST burger I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Can't say it enough. Go here and get the smoked provolone burger with bacon. It's amazing. It's on the same par as Butterjoint, which is a burger haven as well.

I honestly don't know why BRGR or Burgatory keeps coming up as a place to go for a burger, when really, they can't compare to this place in quality"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. I went with 3 girlfriends for ones birthday on a Monday night. Quite crowded for a Monday but no problem getting a table on the patio. Excellent service and great food! Can't wait to go back! Try a burger!"}
{"text":"Been to the Abbey twice now and had a great time. Wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, keeping the meals moving along but not bugging you too much.

The drink list is above average. Nice selection of drafts and a thoughtful selection of cocktails that were very enticing. Both summer and fall had a nice unique mixture of seasonal cocktails as well.

The food is uniformly excellent. Fun and flavorful. The chicken sirrachi dip starter and crab cakes were standout dishes."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, friendly bar staff, killer good mac & cheese and I'm not normally a mac & cheese fan"}
{"text":"There is a lot going on at the abbey and I was extremely pleased with my experience today. First off the outdoor patio is beautiful. Second, the dessert case inside was something different you and usually don't see that too many places. 

My friend ordered edamame hummus with naan bread. It was sooo good! They gave you so much hummus and a lot of bread which is key. Some places give you so much dip and not enough bread, but the abbey delivered here. She also ordered the eggplant sandwich but she wasn't too wowed by it. She said it was pretty tasteless. I ordered the chicken and Gouda sandwich and it came with macaroni salad. I will say the macaroni noodles were on the hard side, but my sandwich was very juicy and flavorful! I would recommend this sandwich to everyone! Overall, my first experience at the abbey was a good one and I will return!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.

At the same time I dont really understand it.  Its a coffee shop, a pretty cool but small bar, and a restaurant.  It feels complicated.  However, my friend and I had a great dinner here and I will def be back.

The food was great but everything very heavy.

I had the burger, which was excellent, but my friend had the bacon mac n cheese and it was so rich we couldn't get through more than a few bites.  Our server was very helpful and recommended this avocado mousse appetizer which we loved, but it was served with fried pita bread.  

The table next to mine ordered fish and chips and it looked so good there's a 100% chance I'll be back for it.  Overall, this place is great with an interesting vibe, just exercise before and after you eat here!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place!

I've been here twice, both for business meetings. It's such a cool atmosphere. It's an old funeral home that they converted, and they did a really great job decorating on the inside. It has a wonderful \"old world\" feel.

I also love the idea of a combined coffee shop and bar - and talk about a good business idea! It makes them a great location for literally any occasion. Plus throw in free parking in Lawrenceville - talk about a well-planned idea.

The first time I came was just for drinks. I had wine, which was good, and just enjoyed the atmosphere. Today I came for lunch. They have a pretty good selection to choose from, but not many vegetarian options. I settled on zucchini noodles with curry and tofu. It was very good - flavorful and just something different. The tofu itself wasn't very good... But all the other veggies were flavorful, so I mostly ate around the tofu.

Overall, I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will likely return. It's cold out now, but I also noticed they have a great outdoor seating space that would be great once the weather gets nicer."}
{"text":"I really want to like The Abbey, and the truth is, I *do* like it. But I feel like it's in that in-between stage where it's trying to figure out how to be everything to everybody, and hasn't *quite* hit the target yet, and I have to be very specific about the timing of when I want to visit, and for what.

The Abbey is part coffeeshop, part bar, and part restaurant. It's in the space of a former funeral home, which this death positive girl really loves. There's a lovely outdoor patio with a fountain, for when the weather is nice. And the hallway is lined with lyrics to Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" 

The coffeeshop area is very cute. During the day, it's a perfect coffeeshop atmosphere. But because there's very little in terms of walls between the coffeeshop section and the bar, as soon as the bar begins to get loud, the sound makes its way over to the coffeeshop area as well.

We've been in a number of times, several times with large groups. The bar service has always been awesome. They've done their best to accommodate the large groups, and if you're just a solo girl with a book who wants to read and sip wine, they are more than accommodating for that, too.

It's mostly the menu where I think things fall flat for me. The options seem a little all-over-the-place and kind of disjointed. On one visit, we had pork belly bruschetta. Sounds interesting, but it just was not meant to be, flavor-profile-wise. And the fried zucchini was just waaaaay too heavy to have as an appetizer. That's filling enough for your lunch, your dinner, and maybe part of breakfast the next morning.

One menu item that is not to miss, however, is the edamame hummus. It is just incredible. Flavorful, savory, and served with warm, soft naan bread.

In terms of booze: if you're a beer drinker, it seems they've really got you covered. I am not, but they have a good selection of wine, and although their tequila section is small, it's more than adequate. They also have a sizable cocktail menu that rotates seasonally.

I think The Abbey is still working out some of the kinks of being a triple-feature event. For example, when we went in for a sit-down dinner one night, we wanted dessert, but we had to cash out at the restaurant and leave our table, then order a pastry from the coffeeshop area. It was like having dinner and then going to a different space for dessert, and I wasn't really into that.

But, if you're gathering for a few drinks and some hummus, this is a good spot. It's a solid 3.5 stars, a place I will definitely return to, and a locale that I will absolutely update my review on as time goes by and they start to nail the concept."}
{"text":"This place is worth trying. I was actually impressed with the quality of the food. We came here for dinner and had made reservations ahead of time. Almost everyone in our table got the fried chicken which was amazing!! We really enjoyed our meal. We also wanted to try the desserts but they didn't have the one that we wanted. Keep in mind that the portions of dessert are really small. Overall, the place has good quality food but they could work on service as it was hard to get the attention of our waitress."}
{"text":"I went there with a small group of friends last night. We had a great time!  The cocktails and food were fresh and delicious, the service was friendly and attentive,  and the atmosphere was very nice. I would go back again."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for brunch. Initially we didn't intend on coming here... Just parked & walked around looking for a good brunch spot. We noticed the adorable patio and decided to stop in.

The atmosphere here is great. Beautiful interiors with a great patio outside including a beautiful fountain. 

Brunch menu offered good options... Omelets, sandwiches, entrees (sausage biscuits & gravy), salads, breakfast burger ect.

Both of us were torn between the Monte Cristo & Chicken & Waffle sandwich. We decided to order each and share. I also ordered a mimosa while bobby went with a glass a Moscato.

The Monte Cristo is served on French toast and  has 'dippy' egg, ham, cheddar & provolone inside with a raspberry sauce on top. While the sandwich was ok, it lacked flavor and honestly the raspberry sauce ruined it for me. It would probably benefit with the sauce on the side.

The chicken & waffle sandwich is just how its decribed... Fried chicken, bacon(!), melted cheddar, spicy maple mayo sandwiched between a waffle. The flavors meshed well together.. It was phenomenal!

All brunch sandwiches are served with pasta salad which was also delish (you Can substitute a different side for an upcharge)

Overall the food, ambiance, service & adorable patio nake it well worthy of 5 stars. Cant wait to stop in for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here before...typically have a good time, but holy hell, is the staff surly. Walked in on a Thursday night at 11:45 (bar supposedly is open til 2) and asked if they were still open since every seat was empty. Received an eye roll between manager and bartender, and finally received the answer, \"We're doing last call.\" No thanks."}
{"text":"Nice enough space, especially when the patio is open. Bar selection is adequate, service is unremarkable, food is shockingly bad. If you go here, eat literally anywhere else in Lawrenceville first."}
{"text":"Took my Mom here for their Mother's Day Brunch. We loved the array of choices- French toast with strawberry compote, steak, eggs, pastries, and fresh fruit. Coffee and tea were included. We ordered mimosas and peach Bellinis, which were very refreshing. They were giving out flowers to the moms, which I thought was a nice touch!

Growing up in Lawrenceville, my Mom enjoyed reminiscing about how The Abbey was once a funeral home. She didn't think it was odd at all that she had been here as a little girl for funerals. They have transformed the atmosphere to be very warm and inviting while keeping the traditional wood motifs throughout.

I would try them for dinner and bring out of town guests here for drinks!"}
{"text":"Stopped off for appetizers and a couple drinks and really enjoyed the place.  Siracha chicken dip was amazing and the mac n cheese was tasty.  Beer selection was great and even had some Arsenal Cider. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"A cool place for having a drink, I can't comment on food since haven't really eaten there, but very nice job with the interior and the outdoor seating is great, just the staff are not very accommodating to big groups"}
{"text":"The waiter was very slow and not as attentive as I'd hope. The food was really good though! I got the blackberry yogurt as a side, but I wish it came with more granola for the portion of yogurt. My friend's corn beef hash was really yummy, as was the salmon eggs Benedict. The restaurant itself is an old funeral home, so it was very interesting inside. There was metered street parking available (free in Sunday's). I wish the restaurant had more healthier brunch options, but if you're looking for savory, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My husband and friends had dinner and drinks on Saturday evening.  We made a reservation and we were seated right away.  We were all happy with our food and drinks.  I would recommend the mac and cheese!  It was sooo good.. our friends had the pork chop special, they said it was really good too.  We all said that we would go back because the food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I like what they did with this previous funeral home.  The set up is pretty good with bar, restaurant, and coffee shop.  There is also an outdoor space.   Overall, strong work on the layout.

The bar has multiple drafts.  The food is decent enough.  Not outstanding but good.  

Overall, nice work converting a funeral home to a bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot!! I highly suggest the Brunch! It was our first time, the waffles come fresh to order and also the omelettes loved it!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the food, which was just ok. My order was also served incorrectly. The drinks were great, however, and the atmosphere was top-notch."}
{"text":"We went here for a weekend lunch. It wasn't too busy, but a little dim inside. The interior is different than a lot of restaurants in the area and I loved it! Do yourself a favor and get the Edamame Hummus to start! It's by far the best hummus I've ever had! I had the grilled eggplant sarnie with the pasta salad and it did not disappoint. This is a cool spot that I'm glad we tried! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went to the coffee bar.  The staff was very friendly.  Loved looking around!  We will came back and eat."}
{"text":"Used to go here every couple of months 
Then they changed the menu 
Every new item I have tried is not good
Overcooked chicken, burned vegetables, sad flavors 
I'm at a loss as to why they changed things, but they are definitely for the worse.
I do not recommend this place any more, even though I enjoy the outdoor seating and the coffee house side"}
{"text":"This review is for their coffee shop.
Good service, delicious local desserts, free refill on coffee.
The atmosphere is very comfortable, multiple sofas to lounge around. 
Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"A unique atmosphere in a unique building.  It is not a \"walk straight through\" kind of place, so as you walk through, there are lots of nooks and crannies to explore.  We were seated by the back bar in the dining area, and it was not too crowded.  I got the beer battered chicken as my entree and it was not in the least bit greasy, super crisp, and the sriracha sauce was just hot enough to add heat and flavor but not overpower.  The lumpy mashed potatoes tasted like something your mom would make, that's a good thing.  A nice potato flavor, complemented with some salt and pepper, not crazy creative, but perfect offset to the heat of the sauce, and a generous portion. My friend got the fish and chips, same batter, and said the fries themselves were worth coming back for.  I only got an entree, she got wine and an entree and we got out of there under $50 with at 20% tip. Lots of people hanging out, I would love to try the coffeehouse part.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's fitting that the Abbey on Butler Street is in a former funeral home, because they are officially dead to me. I will say that we really enjoyed our first visit, except for the host's attitude, when my wife and I went out for a date without our young son. 

We returned this morning, 5/21/2017, for brunch and the neighborhood flea market. That's when we found out that they aren't kid friendly. No high chairs, no booster seats. The Abbey won't get another dime from us. We'll go to The Urban Tap on Highland. The owner there visited our table numerous times to make sure we were well taken care of and had everything we needed.

They get one star, because I can't give zero...

Edit: To be fair, their Yelp profile does say they aren't kid friendly, and I didn't notice prior to this post, but that doesn't change the unwelcoming attitude from the host..."}
{"text":"Went with friends, ordered the Edamame hummus with naan and veggies-very yummy! It kinda ended after that. I ordered a burger, it was dry and flavorless even though I paid $3 extra for the coffee rub. My friend ordered the veggie burger and the flavor was good, however it wasn't a burger, more like quinoa on a hamburger bun. I felt like it was very over priced for the quality of food. Will rethink happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"Terrific combination here of a distinctive decor & excellent food. 

The feel of the place is very much like an abbey with lots of dark wood & grand light fixtures. One huge chandelier is made of a large rose window with stained glass that's been turned on its side. Other details include ceilings that are painted gold. 

My chicken & waffles was memorable & delicious with crispy fried chicken sandwiched between warm waffles. Salad was tasty too with fresh lettuce & tangy dressing. Brownie with vanilla ice cream was a decadent desert."}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" is more like 4 great businesses in one! There is 1) the huge bar room with TVs and great tap list, then 2) the coffee shop with comfy couches and a badass fireplace, then 3) there is the huge outdoor patio with fountain and another badass fireplace, and then 4) last, but certainly not least, there is the dining room with tables and booths and another full bar. 

Each of the four venues is intimately sequestered from the other, so you can be completely absorbed in the atmosphere of where you are (i.e. when you are in the coffee shop, you don't feel like your at a bar). The result, however, is a little confusing when you first arrive because most people are used to restaurants being one thing and one thing only. With the Abbey, it feels like a maze of entertainment that changes around every corner. However, once you get the tour, it's easier to wrap your mind around than you think. 

I have never been too impressed with the food or drinks. I love a good cocktail and mine was so sour that I couldn't finish it. Seems like an issue with the bartender more than the menu. Hopefully, once they get their groove going, we see an improvement in the food and drinks. I am optimistic they will figure it out."}
{"text":"The Abbey is such an interesting concept with a young edgy vibe, the coffee shop has some of the best coffee I've ever tasted and the food is to die for, I would definitely recommend enjoying one of their amazing coffees outside in the sunshine by the beautiful fountain :)

Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Not much more I can add to what's already been commented on a million times. But the fact that this place is an old funeral home deserves to be mentioned one more time! I like the decor and set up of this place. I stopped in for some drinks with some friends on a Sunday afternoon and I like how the bar area was completely separate from the dining area. I also really like the coffee house inside the same spot. I grabbed a cortado to go with my arsena cider. They have a nice drink menu and plenty on tap! Hope to be back again!"}
{"text":"What to do with a place like The Abbey? Is it a restaurant or a coffee house? It's both, and they do each, incredibly. 

Drinks, they have one of the best Old Fashioneds in the Burgh. A little sweet, great bourbon flavor comes through with a little of the citrus peel to enhance it. 

Dinner, opted for a burger, and ordered the house made vegetarian patty with smoked cherry tomatoes, garlic aioli, frisée and Asiago. It's really one of the best House made, meatless patties I've ever had. Perfect bun and a side pasta salad. Excellent! 

Coffee/dessert. We got up from the bar and went to the coffee house and enjoyed a raspberry thumbprint and Latte. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the nice evening. A beautiful fountain in the center is very relaxing and makes for a focal point for diners. The thumbprint was vegan and raw, made with dates, cashews and a dab of (house made?) raspberry preserves, friend of Joe had a  Blondie, she said was chewy, caramelly and rich. 

I must put The Abbey on my regular rotation, perhaps stop some Sunday for Brunch. Kitchen closes at 10pm. Two parking lots, if they're filled there's street parking."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this restaurant, as the building is beautiful and the patio is just so appealing.  Sadly, that is where my positives end.  I had noticed the previous night (online) that the menu is limited.  It doesn't really match up with the ambiance and style of the restaurant.  Mostly, it's just sandwiches with a salad option and a few appetizers.  Dinner wasn't that much better.  I did see several items, however, that I thought I would be happy with.  Like \"Not your grandma's grilled cheese\" and a red potato small plate.  The waiter told me these are not served at lunch, but I just looked online again now and they are listed as luncheon items.  Someone needs to correct their website.   The sandwiches didn't really appeal to me, other than maybe the hamburgers.  I'm not a picky eater, either, but there was always something that I didn't like about a particular sandwich (like curry which isn't my thing).  There were some appetizers and we ordered the zucchini with tempura batter.  It was cut in thick wedges and breaded and was pretty good - the only thing I really liked.  I ended up ordering the pulled pork hoagie with apricot BBQ sauce which sounded yummy.  After a discussion with the waiter, I was supposed to get my BBQ sauce on the side which didn't happen.  Instead it was soaked into the bread and I couldn't even really taste it.  The pork was dry and overly spiced.  I ate about three bites of it.  The sandwiches had a side of either pasta salad or fries (or an upgrade for a side salad).  We chose the pasta salad.  The pasta salad was a macaroni salad that was very similar to that you would get at a  bad deli.   They should not be listing that as a pasta salad.  It should be listed as macaroni salad.  One of our party got the grilled romaine with asiago cheese on top (she had been having some stomach issues and thought that would be the easiest on her stomach).  I thought it was an odd dish for an entrée.  Maybe it would work as an appetizer salad.  That was it - the lettuce sprinkled with cheese.  The third party got the eggplant sandwich which she did like.  Our service was mediocre at best.  In addition to the BBQ sauce mistake, one of our party asked for an ice tea refill which she didn't get until she asked again.  I was never asked about a refill and the waiter was scarce.  They were not busy.   I also asked for something cool to put on my sandwich as it was so spicy.  The waiter said he would bring some ranch dressing which I didn't get until I asked him again.  By that time I knew I didn't like the sandwich and nothing would help it.  There were no desserts that we knew of, but he never really asked and we were going to walk to a nearby bakery where we felt we'd get better desserts anyway.  The place is beautiful and maybe good to sit at the bar.  They really need to re-do their menu.  It has nothing on it that would entice me to come back no matter what the atmosphere.  I do like gourmet food, but I think their menu is just odd, not gourmet or special.   There is a parking lot which is a plus in this busy area."}
{"text":"Stopped through here over the summer and forgot to leave a review. I hate doing late reviews but it's better than not doing one. I think. 

I was doing a Lawrenceville bar crawl and decided to stop in here for a quick drink. Little did I know that it would be really quick. The martinis were made way too strong. It tasted like it was someone's first try at it. Undrinkable. The service was less than desired so we just paid for our crappy drinks and left. 

Beautiful inside but bad service and nasty drinks."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the atmosphere (it's a former funeral home) is what makes this place an experience. We went for dinner, but I would definitely come back for the coffee shop and/or the brunch. I'm very intrigued by the Bloody Mary bar.

I had the pulled pork burger, which I ordered medium rare, and it came well overdone. It was still tasty because the toppings made up for the dry burger. Loved the edamame hummus."}
{"text":"I've gone to the Abbey a few times and I have to say that it is slightly disjointed. There is a coffee bar in the middle of the restaurant and it seems like an odd decision to make when there could be more tables added. We waited a good bit for a table and so this is probably me just being a spoiled diva, but I wouldn't have had to wait so long if there were tables in the center area. We had friends that had a table by the bar and they gave it to us when they left. The bartender came over to clear it off and was pretty rude about it. Luckily she was not our server and the server was very nice. I ordered the shepherd's pie and it was really good but really salty. I love overly salty things so I was fine with it. However, I can easily see someone being overpowered with the sodium levels. I also have to say...the fries on top? Quit it. There were way too many fries and not enough stew. I enjoyed the dish but there were definitely some areas that could be improved. I'm in no rush to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as it was super frustrating experience. 
We made a reservation and checked that there was no disclaimer about kids. It's not a fancy place where one would have to worry. It's casual. 
When we arrived, we found out they do not have high chairs. We asked if we could sit in a booth and we would make it work. They stated they did have booths but they were holding them for other customers. They did apologize but I wish they would have found is a way to dine as we drove thirty minutes, it was not busy when we arrived, and nothing on their website said no highchairs available. Technically our LO could have dined there but they didn't make an effort to accommodate him. It's hard dining with a child so it would have been nice if they made a note on their website or reservation system about not being child friendly as it's super casual. They really could have put us in one of the empty booths. Bummer. They could have handled the situation better. This makes me wonder how we would have been treated if we did dine."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. Sat outside for lunch and listened to the waterfall. Food was amazing and the service was above average. Great selection of beers too. This is a must see!"}
{"text":"Just came home from a beautiful evening at the Abbey. The patio is glorious on a summer night. Our server rates five stars, the food, four. The drinks...two stars. Lovely space, as everyone knows. My husband had the shepherds pie, which, even with the server's warning that it was more like a stew, he didn't like because it was too soupy. I had the cobb-like salad which was fantastic. I had misgivings about the chipotle ranch dressing but it was really good.

Now the drinks. We're cocktail nerds so I can't talk about the beer (or wine). My husband had the vieux carre (twice), and that was quite good. I had three different drinks that were subpar. The \"THIS IS NOT A SPRITZ\" was amazingly tasteless for something with so many good ingredients in. Ditto the White Negroni. Both of these suffered from tiny ice cubes that watered down the drink immediately. Any bar not using 2\" ice cubes in their highball glasses is just out of step with the rest of the cocktail world. The daiquiri was overly alcoholic and under-limed. These people desperately need a bar program with  knowledgeable bartender designing their drinks. There are ten different bars/restaurants in Lawrenceville that make more thoughtful drinks.

All that being said, we'll be back. The server (wish I had asked her name) was wonderful. This has the potential of being a top-notch restaurant/bar. They just need to upgrade their bar standards."}
{"text":"I spent my visit in the coffee shop next door, so I am reviewing only that aspect.

I came in to read a book, and I found the ambience to be incredibly suiting for a relaxing and quiet evening, so much so that I dosed off on their couch by the fireplace. They do have outdoor seating, so I'd like to check that out perhaps on a warm summer evening. Staff was so friendly and welcoming! Coffee tasted amazing (i got a free refill!)

Also, the restrooms were super clean so that made me happy too!"}
{"text":"Put half a dozen church women in the Abbey on a sunny weekday, and you'll get a chatty table full of salads, burgers, and hash, and well lubricated by the summer sangria (tastes like juice). The humus and pita appetizer was big enough for the whole table. My Makers Bourbon peanut butter and bacon burger tasted like it had sat for a while--the cheese could have been more melted--but it was otherwise unobjectionable. The more I ate into it, the more I tasted the bourbon in the peanut butter smeared on the bottom. The consensus was that the current pasta side salad is better than the old one, before the menu was changed. Come early or call to make a reservation if you want to eat outside in the courtyard under a bright red umbrella with the sound of the splashing fountain.

Minus one star for waiting 15 minutes to pay, after the server finally brought our checks."}
{"text":"Cool looking spot, although difficult to find. The bar & coffee shop look very nice. My review is of the restaurant. Not kid friendly, they had no high chairs. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't take my one year old to dinner at a fine dining restaurant. But lunch at a pub or American restaurant is reasonable. Not a lot of veg on the lunch menu besides salad. The pulled pork   was dry and my bun was burnt around the edges. They offer tasteless pasta salad as a side or you can upgrade to fries for 2- I would recommend the upgrade."}
{"text":"This is based on my experience in August last year, but looking back, still just as cool as when I first went! 

I'm not a huge drinker, so I don't enjoy going out to the crappy dive bar type places. This little joint pretty much exceeded my expectations. Went here for my friend's going away bar crawl, and it was lovely! Had never been inside, and it's got such a European antique feel without looking too anachronistic or just too Victorian. Has a very dark-wood-library-esque ambience, and their coffee cocktails look...simply stunning. 

I just had a mocha with...a shot of rum, I believe? I was quite picky, asking the bartender what kind of liquor would go with a mocha latte and he gave me that...or something. I remember pestering him for an exact amount, since I would be driving, but it was perfect. They have a separate coffee counter where you can order simply coffee or tea as well as the coffee cocktails, complete with roasters and grinders, tea dispensers and other required items. 

I sipped from some of my friends' drinks and such, noting some pretty decent drink prices. We sat in one of the side lounges on some black leather couches, and watched a classic movie (some 60s flick, I believe). 

Lovely experience, and I'm so excited to come back!"}
{"text":"I can't even say I've really been here to eat an actual meal but I want to write a review simply to tell people about the edamame hummus. I can't believe I went 25 years without knowing that edamame hummus was even a thing. In my opinion it's even better than your average hummus made from chick peas. I've tried edamame hummus from both the grocery store and Pan that was formerly down the street but nothing compares to the Abbey's. It is served with warm garlic naan bread. The two paired together is out of this world good."}
{"text":"Stopped to try Saturday brunch. Had a buffet for $18. Could have had the same at Eat n Park for $8. Nothing special. Eggs inedible. Had Bloody Mary that was mediocre at best. Not sure I would try again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for apps and drinks and everything is just average.  The atmosphere is cool, definitely chill.  I've sat at the bar and outside and both are nice depending on what you're looking for.

Cocktail selection ok, nothing amazing, but not bad either.  For food, I've gotten the curry fries twice which I love.  I'm not a fan of the buff chicken dip at all. The fried zucchini is ok, nothing to write home about.

Overall, it's and ok place to go when looking for that relaxed feel but nothing special"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks on a Wednesday evening while visiting a friend in the city. The patio and decor of the restaurant were nice and inviting, and a lot of people of all different ages seemed to be going in. However, I think our decision to sit at/in the bar area rather than the patio was where we went wrong.

We sat at a hightop table in the bar area, and were eventually given menus. We were somewhat sternly instructed that if/when we wanted anything we had to request and pick up from the bar. We understood this may just have been policy, and ultimately both the bartender and barback would come out fairly often from behind the bar to ask if we needed anything. Service was just a bit inconsistent, but our drinks were fine."}
{"text":"Caveat - I did not eat here, nor will I return to do so. 

I arrived before my friends and tried to snag a table outside. First, I was informed they do not take reservations for outside tables and that in order to be seated my whole party would need to be here. I accepted and sat down on the couch to wait for my friends. They arrived 15 minutes later and we were informed there were no longer any tables available in the entire restaurant and that there would be an 1.5 hour wait...yet only one quarter of the tables were full. If indeed there were only a few tables left when I arrived, I do not understand why I was not informed then and there or a reservation made for my group. There was no apology or sincerity from any of the front of house employees. At this point we gave up and left. Very disappointing employees. Cannot comment on the food."}
{"text":"It would be difficult to write anything to top what other reviewers have already contributed.  I will keep it simple.  

Interior:  Great surroundings.  Be sure to walk through the place which was a former funeral home.  Don't forget to look up -- unique and charming light fixtures.  A cozy place by a fireplace for coffee, a couple bars, and dining areas abound.

Exterior:  Outdoor seating on the patio is available.  On this particular Saturday, there happened to be an art show and music outside as part of their offering.

Food/Service:  Dined here with a friend for lunch.  We both landed on the same option -- pulled pork sandwich that came with a pasta salad.  Excellent choice.  Advertised as coming with apricot BBQ sauce, provolone, and charred corn salsa, it was quite satisfying, as was the pasta salad.  The were both full of flavor.  We didn't have any problem getting  a table at prime lunch time on this Saturday and service was prompt and friendly.

Price:  Ok by me.  The pulled pork sandwich and pasta salad was tagged at 9 dollars.  Can't complain about that for lunch and portions were perfect.

Yes,  I'll be back.  Guess that's a wrap."}
{"text":"The ambiance, outdoor and indoor seating, and nice mix of bar/coffee/restaurant gets a 4 out of 5 stars.  It's also great that there is some parking available (probably mostly free earlier in the day).  In Lawrenceville, fast/easy parking is a plus.

I'd give the food a 2 out of 5.  The ~$12 sandwiches should be priced at $8 and are still mediocre.  We've had lunch here 2x and I think it's the last."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.   Revisited this place last night for dinner.  Same great atmosphere.  The service was still good but the quality of food has taken a major turn.   The pretzel appetizer has changed and is now served as three logs which are more the consistency of a breadstick than a true pretzel.   I also ordered of my all time favorite comfort food plates, the mac n cheese with fried chicken.   It's no longer a favorite.  The portion was reduced, no longer cheesy and one small piece of boneless chicken breast.  I was terribly disappointed.   The pasta was barely covered in a very loose, runny sauce with very little flavor.    Now terribly overpriced.....   I also considered a bowl of hearty soup.   My only option was a hot and sour type ramen soup in vinegar broth with tofu....what part of that sounds good?  At least they still had a good selection of draft beers on hand."}
{"text":"Had a really nice late-night Sunday night dinner here. Seated promptly on the patio, vibe was classy and chill with gentle \"cool\" music playing in a romantically dark space. After our order was taken, beers and appetizer came out really quickly, with entrees shortly after. 

Nice draft beer list, cocktails looked great, too. Pretty meat-centric menu.

The beers! Both on draft: 
-destihl syncopathic apricot sour ale ($7.50) - super tasty, bright, crisp, went really well with the sriracha chicken dip
-shorts psychedelic catgrass IPA ($7) - earthy, smooth, boo liked it. 

Food: 
-sriracha chicken dip ($9.50)- two thumbs up, creamy, came out hot. Very flavorful and pleasantly spicy. Went well with the sour beer.
-mac and cheese ($13)  - bland, but I  asked for no bacon, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. Generous portion, hot (temp-wise) and very cheesy
-bangers and mash ($16) - my boo said it was nicely curried, hearty. He was excited to try lamb sausage. Flavorful. 

Overall, a good experience. Happy they are open til 10 on Sunday nights! Will be back. 

Also, I went to a work happy hour here a few months ago, and it was very well done. And they gave us to-go boxes at the end! And they have Thursday evening fun pairings/events like deviled eggs or a pie eating contest. And Weds night live music! A cool spot."}
{"text":"Very cool bar, the Abbey has a unique, positive trending gothic vibe, and they always nail the music whether it's an awesome playlist or DJ.  It's in Lawrenville but off of the main stretch, almost directly across from the main entrance to the Allegheny cemetery.  Note, it used to be a funeral home and has a huge outdoor space with a cool fountain, it's also a coffee shop so they have you creative types covered, whether it's a double shot of espresso or a double shot jäger with a PBR after a Stillers win, they provide a cool environment to inspire creative things*

*mgmnt assumes no responsibility for what you do with that creativity..so don't be a jagoff or engage in douchebaggery!**

** coming soon, petition to sign up and make douchebaggery an official word in the Webster dictionary next year."}
{"text":"While our first visit sans child was nice enough, upon our return with our 1 year we were told they don't have high chairs or booster seats making it clear parents aren't welcome. Way to alienate a rich demographic who loves brunch! We had hoped to enjoy the arts fest and flea market as well. I guess \"breeders\" aren't allowed to have lives and go to cool events. Not only will we not return we'll spread the word among all our parent friends."}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place being open from 7am-2am because at any time of the day, it can fulfill your needs from your morning coffee, to dinner, to late night gatherings. I had a very enjoyable salad and an appetizer today on the patio. I would have given it 5 stars but I sent an inquiry on the website last month to reserve a room for a birthday party and nobody got back to me. I even followed up with a phone call and I was directed back to he website."}
{"text":"Cool space with a hidden bar up towards the top of the restaurant. Where my hubby and I were seated. The outside was full when we arrived. And be sure to make a reservation. We had tried to go here before and they wouldn't even seat us they were completely booked. It is an old funeral home and has a very cool vibe. Service was a little slow but the waiter was very nice. He did tell us that he was new. The mussels were to die for! I had the scallops Also very good and my husband had the lamb shank, which he enjoyed. We skipped dessert and took our cocktails to the lounge and hung out there. Definitely recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Staff are very nice and brunch is buffet style with omelet and waffle stations :) lovely place"}
{"text":"Initially walking in, I really loved the ambiance and was excited to have dinner there (this is why it got two stars), but the lack of options for those of us with dietary restrictions really turned me off. I heard there was a vegan option for lunch, and with dinner menus normally encompassing more of what the restaurant can serve, I would have thought that there would be at least one vegan option for dinner. This expectation led to a major disappointment and made me simply not want to eat there. For the location in the city, I would expect more from this restaurant in its ability to accommodate those with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it!  Went for brunch today and was underwhelmed. No eggs (strange for a brunch buffet), no toaster for the bagels (they tasted like they had been frozen at one time), bacon was cooked to the texture of jerky, and the pirogies were rubbery. 

If you want a brunch buffet, try Harris or Shiloh."}
{"text":"The Abbey is a spot that literally has it all - coffee, beer, food.  I've been here for all three, and have been pleased each time. While at first I was skeptic that a place could succeed while wearing so many hats, they seem to have found a nice balance. Today my husband and I went for the coffee branch of the restaurant, and were quite please. We shared a brownie, I got a coffee cocktail, and he had a spiked apple cider. All three were delicious, and now he can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is interesting...there were a few things about it that were standout good, such as their basic burger, which both my daughter and I had for lunch last week. The look and vibe of the place is unique, as well, with its are we a coffeehouse, or a restaurant, or both thing going on. The drinks menu looked great, with some novel combinations and the ones I saw were attractively presented. I didn't try one but I would if I returned. The menu options were fairly limited, but there may be a wider selection of choices at dinner.

The service isn't their area of strength...while my daughter and I weren't questioned about whether we wanted to order $25 worth of food (required to sit on the patio at late lunch time), the couple in front of us (in their mid 20s) were questioned. When I asked if the kitchen could make my fries without seasoning, the waitress was a little rude, telling me first that they didn't have seasoning, and then that they were unlikely to be willing to do so because the kitchen closed in 20 minutes (a break between lunch and dinner service). When I asked if they wouldn't be making fresh fries since both my daughter and I were both ordering (as well as the couple at a table next to us), the waitress seemed unsure. She never returned to confirm that the kitchen could do this, but when our lunch was served, the fries were fresh and unseasoned, as requested, and the burgers were cooked as we ordered them (medium rare).

On the whole, the Abbey was a little underwhelming for lunch, but it might work better as a happy hour and dinner. If I lived in Pgh I'd try it again for that."}
{"text":"I've been here to work alone and in groups, for coffee, beer and for dinner.  It's all great.  There are plants of places to sit and read/work and there's free wifi and plenty of coffee and tea and snacks.  When the day wears on, you can switch to beer.  The bar side gets a little rowdy in the evening but it's a fun place.  Dinner is a bit pricey in the restaurant but it's tasty."}
{"text":"Creepy confusing renovated funeral home ... The bartender was eating pizza behind the bar. Not one person approached us we just walked around aimlessly trying to figure out where to go or how to order. Also, they have the flower delivery sign still up from when it was a funeral home. The vibe was sad and depressing and it just felt creepy. Saturday brunch on May 14th."}
{"text":"We had an incredible lunch here today. The attentive staff seated is quickly. Our waiter (the awesome Shawn!) was there within seconds  with water and menus. Eveything came on time and fresh. Great time, great food and impeccable service. I had the special of grilled mahi mahi with a giant scallop over tomato risotto dome perfectly with the rose' which paired nicely. Raving all day. Will return many times!!!!"}
{"text":"TL; DR - Atmosphere is wonderful. Coffee and drinks are great. Food is meh, with some serious misses, service is horrendous. 

Details - I am not a particularly picky person, but the service at the Abbey was apalling. The person who greeted us was rude. After a wait, and a weird attitude, we asked if they served food here or just drinks. She then asked us \"Are you here for lunch or brunch?\", it was our first time there and it was about 1 pm so we said \"Lunch\". To which she replied, \"Sorry we only serve brunch on the weekend\". Why the attitude and the question then! 

Other issues with service, the wait staff was kind of bad at their job. The plates smelled of old food and the dishes still had food stuck on them even though they had clearly been in the dishwasher, and no one gave us any instructions regarding the buffet (e.g. Where is the buffet table? Do we leave our plates when going for a second round or use the same plates?). Pet peeve which bothered me but might not bother other people: wait staff would respond to questions with \"Huh?\" instead of \"I didn't catch that\" or \"Could you repeat that?\" or just a simple, \"Sorry?\". Also if we had a question or wanted someone to get us the check and they needed to consult another staff person or something, they would yell at each other from across the room, instead of just going and talking to one another.

They were out of much of the food, a lot of it didn't taste good at all although the french toast was it's redeeming quality. 

The coffee? Amazing. Some of the best coffee we have had in Pittsburgh. Also a really good hot chocolate. The vibe was really great and fun and the decor is phenomenal. 

Bring people to the coffee bar. You will get the good vibes, the service is much better and the drinks are worth it. I, however, am never bringing anyone to the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"The fried zucchini app is the best! Such a cool atmosphere. The bar reminds me of s
British pub. I'm really
Glad to have this addition to the city. Great cocktails and the steak was excellent."}
{"text":"We went for brunch, about a week before Christmas with our son and his family. First time for us, a favorite for them. I'm pleased to say they didn't disappoint. From the friendly server to the great food, there's a lot to recommend here. Saw them do a story on Channel 2 on Monday about this place and was reminded how much we liked it. Food, ambience, people. They make the Abbey a place to try and a place to return to."}
{"text":"Cool spot. I've been dying to stop in and see what it's like. It's basically a coffee shop, bar, and restaurant all in one location. I went for the coffee. The service was a little on the slow side, especially for only have 4 orders of drinks. There was only one guy working and he seemed really overwhelmed. My Dad hilariously overheard him telling a fellow employee how \"slammed\" he was... we all laughed at that for awhile.

I really like the interior. I love all the different ways Pittsburgh finds to re-purpose old buildings. Who would think to use an old funeral home for a bar/coffee house/restaurant? It works in this case. They even have an outdoor patio that looks like a super cute place for brunch or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I've now been here about 5 times, and my experiences have been all over the spectrum. The concept is awesome and space absolutely lovely, the coffee is decent and the cocktails are OK (hit or miss), the food in the coffeeshop was also hit-or-miss, and the service leaves much to be desired.

I really had high hopes for this place, and I still do really hope that it succeeds. One of my absolute favorite hangout spots in my hometown is a coffeeshop/bar hybrid called Northside Social. I was hoping that this might be my Pittsburgh version of that.  Who doesn't want to transition seamlessly from coffeeshop working to grabbing a beer with friends, without even moving!

The first time I visited was during the soft opening. I had a killer blackberry espresso cocktail that was unique and delicious. My partner's cocktail was decent as well.  The bartenders were very slow, and reading off of recipe cards, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was opening week.  However, it was clear that they had not hired opening staff who had extensive experience mixing specialty (on-the-menu) or classic cocktails.

I then came twice to work in the coffeeshop space during the day. They brew Commonplace Coffee beans here, and the results are quite decent.  However, my coffeeshop snacking experiences have been mixed.  I have had a delicious peanut butter cookie, an OK cheesecake slice that was a little too cloyingly sweet for me, and the wrap of the day that seemed to have fresh ingredients but VERY bizarre flavors.

Until this point, I had enjoyed the vibe of this place.  The fourth time I visited was on a Friday night, and it was extremely crowded. Furthermore, the type of crowd it had drawn gave the bar a soulless feeling reminiscent of that at Industry Public House, except with a less impressive beer selection and slightly higher prices.  My cocktails were OK, but definitely nothing to write home about. Don't expect consistency if you're a craft cocktail kind of person. Also, you can get cocktails that are just as tasty, and often better, at Spirit for cheaper.

The service was really struggling during my last visit.  They seemed kind of disorganized about seating, when we asked to sit outside.  There were tons of empty tables and yet for some reason we had to wait for some server issue to resolve before we were allowed to sit there.  Our server made us feel quite rushed, bringing the check after we had only had one round.  He did bring us a second round upon request but then rushed our checkout, saying that he had worked a 12 hour shift and was looking to get out of there. He also asked us if we were looking for a job, because apparently servers have been quitting and they need more.

Although I absolutely love the space, both inside and out (the fountain is very nice and relaxing), the service kind of killed my last experience. I will occasionally come back for coffee and to work here during the AM, but The Abbey is no longer on my short list for drinking!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom and dad for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. My dad and I got the fish and chips and the breading was freaking amazing. There are so many things that can go wrong with fish and chips but the only thing I would change is getting the tartar sauce on the side to preserve the crispiness of the fish. We also ordered the zucchini for an appetizer and they had the same batter on it as the fish and it is just so good. My mom ordered the crab cakes and she wasn't too impressed with them. I had a bite of them and agreed. there was something off about them. Not that actual crab meat or freshness but there was some sort of spice that isn't typically used in crab cakes and it didn't work. This restaurant is beautiful. I'm talking amazing. It is worth going in to just check out the interior and lounge in the courtyard with some coffee. The waitress told us that they completely overhauled the menu, so maybe don't listen to a lot of the older reviews because apparently a lot has changed with the food. I heard they do an amazing brunch, so I'm gunna take my parents there next week. Will write another review after that visit."}
{"text":"Well designed space, decent menu and food. Problem is hipster attitude of employees, someone needs to train them in customer service in the restaurant business. It's a tough business and Lawrenceville only getting more competitive There for dinner and waiter explained it's the one year anniversary and was offering mini cupcakes that were in boxes near front bar, nobody had touched them and when I reached for one, a hipster \"woman\" put her hands in me and and rudely told me that were for some other people, just rude and terrible way to handle very small issue, literally and figuratively, it was a MINI CUPCAKE !"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite coffee houses in Pittsburgh is The Abbey on Butler street in Lawrenceville.  A wide array of refreshing menu items and great atmosphere await you.  Great for a Sunday Brunch or an evening snack after browsing the shops on Butler or afternoon break.  Great variety of soups, salads and entrees."}
{"text":"Follow up to the review was insanely unprofessional. Really classy move by the management."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I could see myself coming to on the regular. There are four different parts to the Abbey, but i have only experienced the bar area the couple of times I have been here. They tend to have a nice variety of beer, as well as mixed drinks.

My first experience here included the Provolone Bacon Burger and I opted for the Pork Rinds in place of the pasta salad. The burger was huge (at least by my standards), but nothing really stood out about it and the pork rinds were absolutely delicious. My dinner partner had the scotch duck eggs and the shepherds pie. Both looked good and he seemed to enjoy them.

I recommend this place if you are ever in Lawrenceville and want want somewhere to grab a drink and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place to check out. Lots of space to move around and an interesting vibe. Four of us found seating at the end of the bar on a Saturday night. However, the one thing we were disappointed with was the service. Our bartender was just unfriendly. He sneered when I ordered a diet soda and did not pay attention when one of our friends asked for a specific bourbon. He seemed to be impatient and in a rush, but for no reason (there were several bartenders behind the bar). We will give this place another try with hopes that the service improves."}
{"text":"Offensively bad service. Brought a group of 8 in for a monthly journal club discussion with drinks and apps at 4:00pm. They had a private event in the bar. Refused to give a table in their COMPLETELY EMPTY restaurant because it was all \"reserved for diners.\" Interestingly, on their website it says they have a minimum $25 per person charge to sit at a table. It is added to your bill if you don't buy enough. 

When we explained our situation to management, promised we would be gone by 5:30pm, and mentioned that we are regular customers, they were completely indifferent and told us to go somewhere else.  Given the poor quality of the food at this place, there is absolutely no way their entire restaurant would be filled with dinner patrons at 5:30pm.  

I am shocked this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews, I'm not the only one who's had bad experiences here."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and I can see this place from my apartment.  The inside is cozy and spacious and there is a lovely courtyard to sit with you did or drink. When I went it was cold and rainy,  but I can't wait to go back in the summer to sit and have a drink by the fountain."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio for a late lunch. We started the meal with a shattered water bottle and shards of glass everywhere - an accident but still distracting. My burger and salad were both not served how I had ordered. And the server took a long time to come back at all. After so many rave reviews from friends, it was a very disappointing first visit.

Having said that, I do want to go back to The Abbey to try the coffee bar and wine bar, as well as the brunch. There's also something to be said from the beautiful decor inside and the fabulous patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in the coffee house yesterday and enjoyed sitting on the veranda in the nice weather. The selection was huge and we enjoyed every sip. The little tables on the veranda are, well, little. A tad bigger would be better as two of us had to hold our coffee and pastry on our knee. Have been there before for coffee and for also for drinks at the bar and enjoyed ourselves. 

It was interesting to see that there were two woman parked on the two large sofas. One had two sofas taken up with her laptop, purse, etc. another lady was sitting with her feet up.  Saw us looking for a place to sit but made no offer to move their stuff. We were fortunate that a patron invited us to sit in his little area. 

We will be back though. Parking is a plus."}
{"text":"we're always looking for someplace new. we tried to go once before, but we were told it was between lunch & dinner, & no food was being made! so this was our 2nd attempt. the place is pretty big with lots of different rooms. tom said it used to be a funeral home. it was dark with lots of heavy looking wood. it wasn't until i saw the menu that i realized it was supposed to be an English themed restaurant. on the way out, i noticed words from a queen song written on the wall. okaaaaay.....
the menu isn't big, but they have a little of everything. we ordered the arancini balls. they were nicely fried on the outside & very soft on the inside. the rice was mixed with chopped jalapenos, & had some cheese in the center. they were wonderful! crunchy, soft, & a little sass! 
we both got the seared tuna with watermelon radishes, & grilled green beans with onion. the tuna was perfectly done. the radishes had a little vinaigrette on them, & played well with the tuna. the grilled beans were excellent as well. we just wished there was more!
dessert was a chocolate toffee torte that was outstanding for me, & a chocolate chip cheesecake for tom. 
what we had was great, but there wasn't a big selection of anything, including the wine. what we got was most likely the only thing we would order. the staff was nice enough, though they seemed aloof.  would we go back? eh."}
{"text":"Came here for an extremely rare child-free brunch and VERY pleased to see Brussel Sprouts and Pierogis on the buffet, as well as a variety of potatoes, with pulled port tacos, and bagels and lox. They also offer made to order waffles and omelets so come hungry! Coffee and juice are included in the buffet, and they also feature a bloody mary bar. You can order a house bloodie which I did because I'm a klutz and was afraid of having to carry both a full plate a food and a beverage in somewhat precarious shoes. The shoes were my bad, I dressed up in excitement for going to brunch sans kid. This is my no means a dress up place. Will definitely be back if only for a quick cup of coffee on my way home from yoga."}
{"text":"Great layout with 4-5 different comfortable areas to have a drink. Interesting and tasty menu. We sampled a number of the smaller dishes, would recommend every one of them .Only disappointment was the Sangria. Bar staff need to redo this drink ,absolutely no flavor, was icy red water,it was very disappointing on a really hot day. Beer selection good but should have at least one summer specialty beer on tap.
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner for a few drinks.  We drove around a few times to find a spot to park but I lucked out and parked on Butler Street almost across from Abbey's.  Hey It's was Saturday night in Larryville so it can be tough to park.

     We walked into Abbey's a little confused on where to go.  It was an odd shaped place for a restaurant/bar.  It has a long hallway when you first walk in.  We could see the bar to the right of us but there were a lot of things going on in other areas.  So we just walked into the crowded bar.  There was no room at the bar so we found a tabletop for two in a corner.  My wife went to the ladies room and when she came back a spot did open up at the bar so we made a dash for it and got two bar stools!  

     Once we got settled in it turned out to be a pretty cool bar.  It wasn't too hard to get a bartender and they were cool too.   I liked the atmosphere and the shape of the bar.  You can see their televisions very easily and they looked good.  The drink selections looked really good until we found out that our first beer choices were tapped out all ready.  That was a little disappointing but I was able to find a Oktoberfest that I liked and my wife enjoyed her drinks too.  They were busy so that's understandable about running out of beer.

     If you're out in Lawrenceville this is a place that you should definitely check out.  Grab some drinks and get some food.  We looked at their brunch and lunch menu for a possible return visit.  I'm not sure if the brunch is for us but the lunch menu looks like something we would like to try and their coffee bar sounds really good too.  This is a place we will come back to in the evening when we are in Lawrenceville and we will be back for lunch on a weekend sometime soon."}
{"text":"One of the things I was thrilled about when I found this place is that there are two parking areas. One is very small to the right of the building but if that lot is full you  turn left down the alley and you will find a slightly larger one.

When I entered I realized that this place was once a funeral home hence that would explain the parking. In the front is a coffee bar with goodies and a very relaxing fireplace area along with a patio. In the very front is a study area if you wish to use their internet. They also have outdoor seating as well.

I stopped here for lunch so I was seated in the back. I noticed two, maybe three bar areas for later on in the day. They have a limited selection for lunch so I decided to opt for the hamburger and side salad. The waitress who attended me told me that if I didn't care for the sauce it came with she would put it on the side and bring me regular condiments. FYI-I was told that WiFi is bad in the back area and it is hard to get connected 

While I was waiting for my lunch I visited the coffee bar. I was amazed at the size of coffee they serve you for a reasonable price. They told me to stop over here for  dessert since they make their own fresh daily. This is a challenge for me since La Gourmandine is located just a couple of doors down from here. However, I told them I would stop over.

It did not take very long for me to get my food. My hamburger came as I had ordered well done and the salad was very good. There is nothing really special about the burger outside of the fact I enjoyed it.  They have a very limited lunch selection so there's not much to choose from. You are served water with a bottle and cork on it unless you want a beverage or brew.

After I ate, I went over to the coffee bar and boy they were spot on about that coffee! So good!  I asked about their dessert offerings. They said their recommendation was the seasalt lemon tart. The also had what was called a malva loaf which is an African style dessert. They also had a huge brownie big enough for two people to eat. These are just a few of their offerings.

I settled for the malva loaf to take home with me and refrigerate it. They told me it was thick and filling and believe me when I dug into it they were true to their word! i really enjoyed this dessert so I'm saving some till tomorrow to finish it.

The atmosphere is more like Halloween than a former funeral home. Yet I was pleased with my visit. Again I feel that they should add more to their lunch offerings. The folks I was talking to at the next table told me they didn't know this place served lunch. As a final note if you order a sandwich you get a choice of either pork rinds, french fries. or a miniature version of their tossed salad."}
{"text":"This place is part bar part coffeehouse and part restaurant. I came here for the restaurant. While I heard their burgers were delicious, I ordered the edamame hummus and scallops. The hummus was amazing. The sea scallops were delicious as well. I love the outdoor seating and they have a small parking lot if you get lucky."}
{"text":"I visited The Abbey on Butler Street with some colleagues for a late weekday lunch. There was no shortage of tables/seating though I am sure it gets quite busy on weekends. Our server was very friendly and attentive.

There's quite a large selection of adult beverages - I got the impression this list was rotated fairly regularly as well so there should be something for everybody. We started with two appetizers - the sriracha chicken dip and edamame hummus. Both were very tasty and certainly large enough to accommodate our party of four.

For the main course, the majority of my group had burgers. The menu (for lunch at least) doesn't have an overabundance of options, but there should be at least one or two items to suit everyone's taste. Side options include fries, pasta salad, or a side salad - a nice touch to have additional choices. The burgers were quite tasty and cooked accurately to our requested temperatures.

All in all, we had a very positive experience here. The ambiance is unique and warm. Location-wise, parking is a little easier here than on some stretches of Butler Street further down, so that's also a plus. Definitely check The Abbey out if you're looking for places to eat in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Went to brunch, sat at the bar and was extremely disappointed. My husband ordered a Bloody Mary and the only thing you could taste was horseradish. Saw a few get sent back, which did not prompt the bartender to make a new mix. We ordered the Monte Cristo and Corned Beef and hash. Both were supposed to come with over easy eggs, however both came with yolks fully cooked. To top it off, the corned beef was 90% brisket, 10% corned beef. Instead of simply telling us they were out of corned beef, they tried to pass off brisket as corned beef."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch and had a good meal with nice service. Their French 75 was one of the best I've had, with lots of fresh lemon. I ordered the corned beef hash which was tasty and filling. The people I was with had been there once before for brunch and ordered the Montecristo for a 2nd time. They were a bit disappointed comparing the sandwich."}
{"text":"Wow.  New menu ! What a difference.  They have now moved up to the high end !  The choices are all made  in house by true chefs. Not over the top as many do in   Lawrenceville.  You can taste the great food and seasonings.  Perfectly done"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I just got drinks and thought it was the coziest place ever. The second time I went, I got dinner and I feel like I've been poisoned. The Pub Curry Chips came out cold and the Makers Mark PB Burger was decorated, expensive, charred ass. I regret my whole life."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open and was so excited when it finally did. Managed to stop by and have a beer on the second or third day. The design concept is just stunning. Seems to have a good vibe. Can't wait to get back and try the food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch which is served buffet style. We sat on the patio with our friends and the baby and the service was great. Bottles of water on the table to help keep us hydrated. 

I had a greenflash passion power beer which was delicious and refreshing with breakfast. There were also different breakfast cocktail options and our friends each had one including a boozy iced coffee and a bellini. My husband had a pineapple cider(least favorite of the bunch). Coffee was also included on the buffet. 

The food was good. It was a small selection of well done food! The fruit was fresh, the biscuits and veggie sausage gravy was delicious and you would never know that the gravy was vegetarian. My favorite item on the buffet was the breakfast sausage. There was also an omelet station which our friends really liked. 

I can't wait to go back to try some coffee from their cafe and more of their menu!"}
{"text":"To say they're not kid friendly is an understatement. The hostess was downright rude when she smugly told us there were no high chairs or booster seats. If they don't want kids that badly, make it more explicit on the website to prevent people from feeling so unwelcome. Our waiter was nice, food was okay but not amazing, and the bloody Mary's were too spicy and undrinkable. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The first time I walked in I thought it was a little weird, the idea of drinking, eating, laughing in a former funeral home. Also, potentially the idea of it being haunted. But I assure you, I was not haunted, other than by too many drinks the next morning!

For Lawrencveville, it's a really large space. There's a front room with a large bar and seating area, and then there's a smaller back bar with more tables for dining. And maybe the best part, there's a huge patio with a beautiful fountain in the center. Perfect for warm summer nights!

But not only is this place a bar and restaurant, but it also houses a coffee bar, in another huge room with couches and tables to lounge at. I haven't gotten to partake in the daytime activities here, but I'm looking forward to working/hosting meetings here soon. 

I've had a couple of dishes from the kitchen as well. The winners have been the Sriracha Chicken Dip, Grilled Shrimp and Rosemary White Beans, and the Abbey Normal Mac and Cheese (so good!!). They were all great and super flavorful choices.  However, the Tempura Battered Zucchini would have been better crispier and seasoned more and the Bahn mi Bruschetta's pork was a little tough. 

Specialty cocktails are $10 and they are fantastic! The first one I had hooked me, the Recycled Paper Plane (bourbon, Aperol, Ramazzotti, lemon juice). It was spectacular and it's hard to not order that every time I'm there. I did switch it up once and ordered up a glass up Rose... Yay for Rose being on menu! 

Glad to have this spot open, as it will probably be one of my go to places in the 'ville!"}
{"text":"Wow what a lovely place. We stopped to listen to a friends band playing and I was shocked to see the stage crammed in the side of the bar area? If your trying to grab a drink forget it. The bars was too crammed with people just standing there listening to the band. Poor staff trying to get through the crowd that spilled out into the entry way hall. Love the place and haven't tried he food yet so ill update the rating when I do . But please please get yourselves situated if you are going to have live music make sure you have a decent stage and set up and an area for people to enjoy it ."}
{"text":"Cool new spot. We stopped in for a drink. It's an old funeral home but you would have no idea. It is gorgeous inside with so many different rooms. Once you get your drink (coffee, wine, beer, etc) you can move off to a lounge area to relax and socialiZe. The day I was there I almost got the feeling as if it was a Starbucks for adults. Many people had their mixed drinks and laptops and were busy on their computers. Cool concept"}
{"text":"Coffee shop + bar + fireplace + comfy couches + outdoor seating + delicious, fresh food. What can't you like about this place?! Highly recommend the zucchini noodle coconut curry dish and the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"OK I'm back to three stars, and it's really for the super-friendly baristas and nice coffee selection. I'm still frustrated with the general lack of customer service (outside of the coffee bar), lack of veg/vegan menu options, and the lack of consistency in offerings (one day, nice veggie wrap offered only to never be seen again). 

The one thing I CAN count on is a strong cup of iced coffee (with non-dairy cream/milk options!) and a stellar Thai Iced Tea that I think my husband could sustain himself on that alone.

I've had cocktails at the bar a number of times, and they are good if a bit pricey. The Abbey does boast a nice draft beer list, but in Lawrenceville, that's the norm not the exception.

The atmosphere is amazing, and the outdoor space rivals any other 'burgh patio as one of the city's best. But inconsistent service as well as food offerings and lack of non-meat & potato options keeps me to mainly enjoying only the coffee bar."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice, both times with a large party of women who were ready to spend money on a girls day for both food and drinks (bottles). The first time, we waited at the host station for about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged to have patio seating. Once acknowledged and seated, our server took an additional 10 plus minutes to show up and greet us at the table. Service was mediocre at best after that. Most of the party got the same or similar food orders, and the food was definitely good! So on a girls day that followed a couple months later, we returned. Service was worse. We arrived at 3:10. We were told we weren't allowed to be seated with the exception of bar seating bc the kitchen was closed between the lunch/dinner service. Okay. No problem. Until we read the menu saying kitchen closed between 3:30-4 to turn over service. I asked if we could be put down for a table for three outside and be seated at 4pm, when he the kitchen opened again. Was told no, come back in and get in line (even though by then we would have been there as paying customers for 50 minutes). We waited on the patio \"bar\" seating  area and had to walk in and out to order/pay for our drinks. Again, not a huge deal. Until at 3:45 we saw parties also sitting in the patio bar area being waited on and served food. A table of 5 or so near us was visibly frustrated as well. Both tables were told we were only allowed to sit outside for self serve bar drinks bc food wasn't available until 4. Another table received food orders. The party who was near us and also frustrated took their business else where. We decided to go in at 3:55 and get in line to see how we were treated and decide to stay or go based on that. The host came over at 3:58. The same one who knew we had been there waiting on a table for almost an hour...and AGAIN, asked us to wait until the servers were ready from their break and set up for dinner. At 3:58...when the kitchen \"opens\" at 4pm. Their policies on how the treat and restrict paying customers are absurd. The host wasn't even apologetic, empathetic, or reasonable. He basically acted like we were an inconvenience after they had already null and voided the policies they have in print on their own menus. We then left and spent hundreds of dollars at \"dive\" down the street. The Abbey will never receive business from me and my group of friends again and it's a shame bc the food is good. Terrible staff all around, particularly the hosts and wait staff."}
{"text":"My craving for a good burger this month is officially terminated. We found this cool place while taking a stroll, the old-fashioned way. 

1- My friend had the Westminster salad with chicken which was humongous! It has fresh ingredients of many green leaves. Chicken was mediocre. 

2- Back Yard chuck burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, delicate and had tomato, red onion and frisée. The melting tillamook cheddar goodness and the chef's 1 K tangy sauce were a great successful marriage. 

3- glorious walk at the newly open hiking trail next door, Allegheny Trail, is a MUST after food. We saw so many geese blocking the road and a full clan of deers. Added a wild lovely touch to our evening. Have a meal and take a walk is one of my mottos. 
4- newly opened place (since April 2016)
5- free easy parking. 
6- outside seats are lovely but couldn't do because of the rain. 
7- the restaurant door handle is a huge glass cylinder filled with roasted coffee beans. So cool!! 

They were out of the special tonight! Yes! It was that busy! Atmosphere was rambunctious and lively."}
{"text":"Amazing space, great patio, friendly staff, excellent brunch buffet! This place is definitely going in the rotation!"}
{"text":"Please pay attention to the other reviews out there. Some things were awesome some things were the same as what I read. I wish I would have listened to a few. This place is beautiful, so much attention to detail. Most of the food I had and my party had when were here was pretty good but not a place we are running back to overall for just the food. The Scotch eggs were some of the best though."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Friends & family were in town from LA last night. After meeting at Grapperia we could not decide where to head for food that would be substantial. 

Lawrenceville has a lot of places to eat. It starts to feel like every place in the neighborhood feels the same & serve the same type of meal. After much debating, a friend suggested we retry this location. Boy, were they correct that this was the place to go!

We started our group with a table order of curry fries, zucchini, chicken dip, & hummus. I can't tell you how the hummus was because they use Edamame in the hummus which I have an allergy towards.  Which is disappointing for me. However, other seemed to like it but nowhere near as much as the Sriracha chicken dip. Which had just the perfect amount of heat and savory chicken when paired with the pita. Of course our group had to order a second order of the Chicken dip w pita.  It was DELICIOUS. 
We enjoyed the zucchini served with aioli with its fat, freshly breaded spears however the Curry Cheese Fries were borderline addictive in comparison. I didn't anticipate the fries to be as amazing as they were. To me they just don't sound amazing when ordering. When presented. Oh. My. Gawd. Are they delicious!!!  The French fries are seasoned ever so slightly with a curry. Not to heavily but just enough to pair perfectly with the Welsh Cheddar they're smothered on top.  Like I mentioned, I didn't expect to like this but I couldn't believe I LOVED these fries. 

I love where The Abbey is headed. The bar of course was slammed while we were there. Strangely the restaurant area was quieter than I expected.  One thing I find disappointing about The Abbey is that as a restaurant smack dab within a multigenerational neighborhood, they make no provisions to accommodate families in their cafe or dining room. The lack of a high chair speaks volumes about the type of neighbor they plan to be. And that's a bit disappointing. Especially for a multi space venue like the Abbey that serve as a coffee shop & restaurant; and not just another bar."}
