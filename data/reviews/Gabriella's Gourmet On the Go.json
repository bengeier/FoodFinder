{"text":"corned beef hash: none. however, they do have high quality, unique breakfast and lunch sandwiches. they serve non-pittsburgh fries -- not fresh cut, sans skin -- tossed in some delicious salt mixture."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had! Great food, prices and service! Awesome little gem with amazing gourmet \"fast food\""}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership and while the old menu remains, their new specials are out of this world.  On two separate occasions I have had friends tell me that they make the best chicken that they have ever had. (Fried and Grilled)  Their greens are on point, veggies to die for, and the pricing, friendliness, and quality of service is great!.  Best advise, if you're hungry and nearby -- walk in."}
{"text":"Great place on the corner next to terminal way! Anytime I'm working in the area i try to come down for lunch. The Italian hoagie and philly are my favs! Owners very nice too! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times and each meal was delicious! You get a large portion for relatively low price and their daily specials are a great deal. I recommend the chicken caprese sandwhich and the jimmy the greek. Their shoestring fries are excellent! They give you just the right amount which leaves you feeling satisfied without the fried food guilt. Very friendly staff and quick service. I recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Pete was very nice, and got my food done quickly, it was awesome! And it wasnt expensive like allot of places downtown 5/5 am going again!"}
{"text":"Great little diner! I used to work near Gabriella's and always enjoyed the special treat of the Greek breakfast sandwich. Gyro meat, egg, feta - all in a delicious pita. So good!  I stopped back in (for the first time in a long time) and learned that while the ownership has changed the sandwich hasn't! Pete was so friendly and made a great sandwich, fries, and breakfast platter for us. There always coffee, hot and iced tea, and there is a cooler with beverages as well. The shop is tiny, but has seating for over 10 between the counter and two bar areas.  The menu has so many options - breakfast and lunch. The location sits between Station Square and the Southside - but it's worth it to plan to stop in for a great meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and i had an amazing experience at Gabriella's. We stopped in for a late breakfast. He ordered the shrimp & grits. I went with a brrakfast burrito which also comes with a hash brown on the side. The burrito is huge and the total is less than $9. My husband's shrimp and grits literally melted in my mouth. Probably the best shrimp & grits I've had at a resturaunt and I've tried a lot of yuppie brunch spots. My only issue was my burrito was only supposed to have eggs, meat & vegetables. It also had lettuce and tomato on it which i found odd. I took it off and didn't say anything because it was still good.  We were treated with extreme kindness and hospitality here.  The menu options are great and they also have daily specials. On the day we went, at least 7 specials were offered.  This place is a gem, a diamond in the rough. Excellent food, excellent friendly service.  Hours are 5am-3pm monday-Friday. Inside there's a few counters to sit at and enjoy.   Breakfast all day.   Highly recommend. Definitely stop in and see for yourself. Lots of love is put into this place by the employees"}
{"text":"I had a hair in my food and was told it was just egg. It was a short black hair. Never have I ever been treated so crappy.  No way will I ever come back here."}
{"text":"I have to update.  Since my last review I've tried 3 other dishes. Most recently the 1/4 fried chicken. Seasoned perfectly and the breast was succulent.   I've taken 10 additional people and they all loved it. Although parking is a challenge, I can usually find a spot on one of the side streets off Carson."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot!!! The food is always on point..breakfast and lunch is bomb! Also the service is great! Thanks Pete and Morgan!"}
{"text":"So, by \"close at 2:30\" they mean if you arrive at 1:58, they will be sweeping up and say the kitchen is already cleaned up and closed. I indicated I was a first time customer but that didn't matter. Boo!"}
{"text":"Had a Schrader one day and been back a few times. Friendly small diner atmosphere. And fast the food is good and a good price! Daily specials!"}
{"text":"Small, clean, little, family owned and operated. I stopped here for breakfast as I waited for my car to get fixed and I was delighted to have a good breakfast for what I paid. I hung out for about an hour, ownership was friendly with every customer and clearly happy to serve their repeat customers. This place is perfect to pick up a quick lunch, or breakfast on the go as the name eludes to. My favorite part of this place is that the prices aren't trying to be anything more than fair and the chef/staff is more than willing to make any substitutions or alterations to your order for you without a problem.   I mean, this isn't going to be the best you've ever had and it doesn't try to be. It's the equivalent of a to-go diner, but the attitude of the ownership/staff and the variety of options makes this place a reasonable option should you be in the area. It makes you WANT to give them business.   Great for a quick bite any day of the week."}
