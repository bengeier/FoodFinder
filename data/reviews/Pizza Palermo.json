{"text":"We will never order delivery from Pizza Palermo again. Delivery from Pizza Palermo is the equivalent of arm wresting an octopus.  While the food isn't bad, the delivery people never want to actually deliver the food to the apartment; they'll call from downstairs and ask you to meet them at their car in the street.  That's not delivery.  We order on line, so everything is paid in advance, including the driver's tip and the delivery fees.  It's not like they're going to get stiffed.  And street parking is readily available within reasonable proximity to our building, and is free after 6PM.  They call and argue that there's no place to park while I can see from our window that they're already parked while we're on the phone.  We called and spoke to a manager to complain about this and we were told it's their policy \"not to deliver upstairs, unless it's an emergency\".  I can't imagine what constitutes a pizza delivery emergency.    If I have to put on shoes and run out to the street to pick up the food, I'd just walk the extra block to their store.  I'm paying for a service, why not deliver?  Original Milano's (412-404-7530) is better, and they never have a problem delivering to our door."}
{"text":"Needed a quick meal last night for my fiancé, his 2 kids, and his friend. Found a coupon in the Enjoy book for 'buy one, get one' large pizzas. Almost 18 bucks for two. The wait was longer than I expected but the pizza was pretty good. No complaints from anyone and only a few slices left over."}
{"text":"I just got a large pizza and a slice of cheesecake for delivery...the cheesecake is MOLDY!!! :("}
{"text":"The Alfredo was extremely runny. I didn't enjoy it at all. The delivery was prompt and the pizza was good but the Alfredo was terrible."}
{"text":"I am addicted to Pizza Palermo. Great flavor. I love the ranch sauce combined with valentina and authentic Palermo Pizza! just for $10!! unbeatable price-value!"}
{"text":"Ordered here before and it's decent pizza for a reasonable price. Ordered tonight and two long hairs in my half hoagie... Called to let them know and I was told that only men were working and there is no way it could've been from there.... Disappointed in how they reacted and made it seem like I was lying about hair in my hoagie. Think I'll be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Pizza Palermo is on the expensive side as far as pizza places go. Luckily there are 4 other pizza shops within a very short distance of each other in this area
My favorite thing on the Pizza Palermo menu are their hot wings. They are jumbo sized wings with a hot sauce that is easily my favorite. It's not just spicy hot, it has good flavor.
The hoagie are hit and miss depending on your taste and which hoagie you order.
The pizza is decent but just around the corner you'll find much better pizza.
I'd go out of my way for their hot wings but I'd go to other shops for anything else and it'll be cheaper too."}
{"text":"Ordered a large gyro wedgie with gyro sauce online from the Turtle Creek Pizza Palermo and recieved a chicken gyro with marinara sauce. Called them about the mistake and the person on the phone said that he would text me a picture of the order they recieved.  I told him that the receipt I have stated that I ordered a gyro wedgie.   He then stated that he cannot replace an online order. When I asked for a refund he became agitated and very rude.  He then said that he would only replace my marinara sauce with gyro sauce. I'm pretty sure that they should be responsible their online ordering system error. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never order from this place again."}

{"text":"Pizza Palermo is great! It's priced well, service is awesome, employees are friendly, the pizza is always really good, they have a wide delivery range, and it's always FAST. I think they overestimate their delivery time on purpose. The operating hours are great too.

No need for a long review here....it's just a good pizza shop."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying their food is great. However DO NOT order delivery from this location. I placed an order online at 12:16 PM. At 12:48, I received a call asking if I wanted ricotta in my calzone. Uh, yeah, that's why it's a calzone. I waited another 45 minutes or so and still no delivery. Their site said 45 minutes. I then called the store to cancel the order. They tried to tell me I placed the order at 12:48, I explained this was not the case and to credit my card and cancel the order. I was told the delivery was on the way and couldn't be canceled. I told them again to cancel it. No one showed up with food. I then received another call from them telling me the order was placed at 12:48 and was on the way. Again, I explained that I would refuse delivery and wanted my card refunded. They refused and told me I had to accept the calzone when it arrived. I said this was not going to happen and told them I had e-mail proof that my order was placed at 12:16, they again argued with me. I was called a third time and told that they were calling about my calzone and it was on the way. I said I would not accept it and wanted my card refunded. The gentleman said he would make me a fresh calzone and have it delivered. I refused. He said \"I don't want to lose you as a customer, but the order was placed at 12:48\". I said I had the e-mail confirmation of the order at 12:16. He then checked and apologized admitting I was correct.
He and went on to explain calzones take longer (uh, I used to work in a pizza shop so I know this is untrue). I refused a new calzone and reiterated my request for a refund.   A simple online delivery order should not be this big of a cluster. They have definitely lost a customer, not just from the screw up, but three phone calls trying to bully me into taking a calzone that was over an hour and a half  plus for a store that is less than 2 miles from my office."}
{"text":"Wings/chicken and ranch dressing good.  Pizza, not good. Sicilian Dry. Unacceptable. Do better."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was just ok the bread sticks were great. My steak hoagie was really good. Buffalo fries were pretty good. The container needed holes so the fries didn't get soggy. And cheese sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Pizza Palermo, you are by far the best pizza shop I've ever eaten at. You have the best ingredients and great cooks and they are really friendly and polite. Quick takeout and delivery times and always on time or before the time they give to you for delivery. Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"So good! I love to get delivery from here- but they also have wifi at the restaurant! Yum their ranch is really good with white pizza + spinach. Their cheesy bread is the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza from here that was full of head hairs and some other kind of short hair (beard/pubic/??? hair). We called and complained, but were denied a refund. Instead, they offered a replacement pizza or $3 off our next order. Seriously? We're going to avoid this place, and if you enjoy good customer service and hairless pizza, I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I was impressed with how big their menu is given how small the actual place is.  There were numerous pasta, hoagie, burger, appetizer, salad, calzone, stromboli, and gyro options...and pizza of course.  I have tried the pizza and the cheese steak hoagie.  I would go back for the pizza, but not the cheese steak.  There are plenty of tables to enjoy lunch at, or dinner if you wanted, but I wouldn't really consider this a dine-in dinner location.  They do have delivery and take-out which are probably the primary business.  Catering options are available for large gatherings."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Shadyside and i decided to give Palermo a try. Ordered 12 hot wings and cheesy bread sticks and was very happy with the service and enjoyed the dine in area. Very clean and nice. I would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Probably my go to ordering place for delivery in the area. Sad it gets 2 stars. Food is good for the most part but inconsistent. Guessing different cooks. Top notch ranch. Awesome hot sauce/buffalo (whatever it is) if anyone knows, shoot me a message, trying to find a recipe to make it. 

Buffalo chicken pizza is normally good. Sometimes it comes with like 0 sauce so I always order a side of hot sauce (same thing). Last time it sucked. No sauce, 1 tiny piece of chicken average per slice. Small amount of buffalo fries. Light cheese. When paying $20+ for a specialty pizza I'm expecting a specialty pizza. Other times it's phenomenal.

Fairly decent pizza when not inconsistent. 

Buffalo chicken tenders are normally top notch. Like I said, love the sauce. Last order was extremely overcooked and dry with barely any sauce. Tiny bit on the top and completely plain underneath. Not hard to toss them in it & not enough sauce given with them to toss them myself.

Calamari from a pizza shop? Sweet. Normally good in ranch. Practically no seasoning though. To make up for that I'd toss with parm but they don't. Last time, overcooked to all hell. 

Hoagies? I've ordered them here before. Don't remember my thoughts on them so apparently they were nothing special. If I want hoagies now I have other places I'd order from. 

Delivery drivers are lazy. They practically want you to meet them at the car. I get a call saying they are here like 5 minutes before they actually arrive and I've never had one walk up to my house, ever. DJ Khalid even got an attitude when he handed me my pizza box and I asked if they got the extra sauce I ordered. Nothing better than refreshing ice cold ranch thrown in a piping hot pizza box. (Sarcasm). 

I've never found live worms, head and pube hair or mold on my food like other reviews have stated. 

Overall inconsistency of food gets a 3. Delivery drivers get a 1. Overall, a 2. I wish it could consistently be a 5 on food. Can deal with lazy, ignorant drivers for good food."}
{"text":"For college students like me it's nice to have a good, delicious and warm food deliver to your door ON TIME if not sooner . I am very pleased with customer service from phone people to delivery guys. Pizza Palermo has become my all time go to place. Ohh and a small note classic Italian hoagie is my favoriteeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Been a Pizza Palermo customer for a long time now. Yesterday I ordered my regular (extra cheese & pepperoni) and had a minor emergency and wasn't there when the pizza showed up. Crisis averted, I called the delivery guy back (I saw the caller ID on my phone, he tried me 4 times before giving up) and asked if he was still in the area and would he mind bringing back my pizza. In just 20 mins he showed up with my food. It took that long because he thought my original pizza had become too cold, so he went back and had them make me another. Amazing.

Their pizza has always been good, their delivery always quick even during busy times, and the prices have always been great. But after this epic show of awesome-sauce, they deserved to be yelped.

Are you hungry? Do you like pizza delivered to your door? Do you live in Pittsburgh? Stop reading yelp and call Pizza Palermo."}
{"text":"Such unsanitary conditions. I ordered two slices of pizza to go and the woman working did not use gloves to pick up my pizza and place it in the box. She compulsively touched her hair and cell phone in between customer orders and never once washed or hands or put on gloves. The fountain machine was out of ice and when I alerted the woman working the register she told me just to get a drink and that it should be cold enough without needing ice. Horrible service and disgusting conditions! I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered online and didn't get my free breadsticks for making an order over 20$ . Came on time but it was cold and the wings were horrible! They are these weird breaded things with no meat. Pizza sauce is sucky. Not ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Great carry our & delivery! Love their Pizza and their sauce! They also have pineapple as a topping which me & my son love! 

Pricing is comparable & reasonable as well"}
{"text":"We've got delivery about 4 times in the last six months including today.  The pizza has been really good especially the meat lovers.  We love the breadsticks most of all and they have been free with our orders.  Today the pizza ad breadsticks were hot when we received them.  The delivery women was very nice.  I've had a great few experiences with them!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've ordered from Pizza Palermo. This time was by delivery. They delivered before their estimated time. The pizza is piping hot and we also got free bread sticks! The pizzas are a pretty decent size for the price. I also used an online coupon and saved some money. Decent crust, good sauce and good flavor over all.
My only complaint is too much cheese for me."}
{"text":"I recently ordered a meal from the McKeesport location onlone with grubhub. After my order was slightly late, I had placed a call to check the status of my order. I was told that they were running behind, that my order was being prepared now, and it would be another 30 minutes. I thanked him and patiently waited. This first call was at 5:48, I called back at 6:57. This call was supposedly me speaking with the manager, the general mamager actually, and it was quite unpleasant. He told me that my order never existed at first, until I told him my order was done though grubhub. He then told me that my order was never started, and asked if I'd like to cancel or have it made now. I declined to have it made now as hesaid it would be another hour on top of my already 3 hour wait. I then asked this man for a corporate number and was given one. A random man answered and had no idea what I was talking about. This is the actions of a man who claimed to be a manager. That sums up the first experience Ive had with your company, and I'm purely outraged."}
{"text":"Pizza Palermo is SO good, always very accommodating, and the workers are so kind. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"The worst gyros I have ever had. No meat in it and it was not cheap. Stay away from this place. I will not be going back here again !"}
{"text":"Had a deluxe pizza from here last night, and it was delicious!  Lots of toppings, nice sauce and great crust!  Cooked perfectly, even gave us some really good ranch dressing to dip the crust in!  My brother picked it up and commented on how nice the young man was that took care of our order.  Looking forward to ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"In my mind,  this place is pretty solid. The sandwiches are tasty,  the pizza hits the spot, service is adequate, and they have $8 lunch specials. They have a fairly extensive menu as well.

Id recommend the Italian hoagie, I think they do it quite well here. The half is plenty for one person. 

It's a great spot just a 10 minute walk from Walnut, and seems to literally always be open. I'm pleased."}
{"text":"We got delivery from here the day after St. Paddy's as recovery food.  We ended up getting a large meat lover's pizza, wings, and breadsticks.  The food was just average.  The pizza was actually soggy on the bottom, which is kind of a pet peeve of mine.  The wings ended up being the best part of the meal so I may come back for those.

Meat Lover's pizza: 5/10
Wings(garlic and hot): 7.5/10"}
{"text":"We get pizza from here every Sunday and well never again. We pulled in at 12:10 am and the door the says open till 1 am. Once the employees seen us they ran to shut the lights off. Really change your hours if you are not open till 1 am."}
{"text":"I was impressed to say the least. They had a 45 minute window for delivery, it got here in less than 20 minutes. The delivery man was professional and prompt. 

Now onto the food. I ordered a hungry man, because I like the food to last for a couple of days. It comes with a sub and a pizza. I suggested that it would be enough food for a couple of days and I wouldn't have to do anything crazy. The sub was like 14 inches and the pizza even though they claimed it was a large, was more like an extra large. There was plenty of food to go on the Hungry man. Plus they give free breadsticks for ordering online. 

You honestly can't go wrong with this place. Great pizza, big amount of food, and reasonable prices. This is now my delivery place when I'm at home."}
{"text":"We order food from pizza Palermo few times a week . Food is amazing ! Customer service is really good,people are polite and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place gets a 4-star review just for the incredible service.  Though I didn't order a pizza (breadsticks and fries), the guy on the phone said the delivery would take about 45 minutes.  I was absolutely shocked when my phone rang after just 20 minutes.  The food was good, about average to above average for breadsticks in the city, but I will definitely order from these guys again.  It's quite a rarity when a delivery order is half of the expected time you're originally told."}
{"text":"I ordered the buffalo chicken salad and a side of cannolis. Both of which were amazing. I like hot sauce and it is definitely a HOT sauce. The chicken was perfect. The cannolis were fresh and very good! Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"I regularly order delivery from Palermo and think that they make the best pizza in the East End.  I find the crust often a bit underdone, but a few minutes in the oven at home and the base of the crust crisps up to my ideal.  My personal favorite is a white pie with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and Fontinella.  The breadsticks are also tasty (especially with garlic sauce) and the fried zucchini also has a great flavor.  the service is always prompt and the late hours are great."}
{"text":"This place is right by my work, so when I forget lunch I normally order from here. And I have branched out to try a few things. I am a HUGEEE fan of their calzones. I normally get a small one, and have it 2 days for lunch. They are very cheesey and have plenty of toppings in them.  Their house made ranch is a little on the expensive for the amount you get, but it is AMAZING. Their salads are good. My Caesar Salad was nothing special. It was a decent size, probably wouldn't order it again. I was hoping for more. I have also had a steak salad (with added bacon). I was slightly upset when it came with packet ranch dressing and not the amazing dressing (half the reason I decided to buy it). Decent size, plenty of toppings, could have done with out the $1.50 extra for the bacon, though it is real cut bacon. The steak in the salad wasn't very good alone. (cheaper quality) but with the fries, cheeses, and other toppings it was good. I have had the tiramisu and the cannoli. The cannoli was 3 small very hard store bought shell. The filling was okay, a little oily, and started to separate. (probably from the heat while being delivered). The Tiramisu was good, again nothing super special. Also tasted store bought, but not bad. Might order it again when craving something sweet. The delivery men are always very nice to deal with, never have had an issue with them. If you decide to go here, I recommend staying with pizza/calzones and you shouldn't be let down. (My co-worker orders their pizzas and said they are just as good as the calzones). Also, if you order online with a $20 purchase you get a free order of breadsticks. I personally like them, if you eat them fast. Once cold they aren't very good. I am also not a fan of the sauce, but everyone else at the office is. Hope this helps :)"}
{"text":"I got a small pizza 3 toppings came to almost ten bucks, wasn't anything special. Shouldv'e stayed with dough boys two slices two toppings more than a small and way better pizza for half the price. Couldn't see myself going back because of pricing, quality product at fair prices, wasn't surprised they weren't busy at dinner on a Saturday Night"}
{"text":"Pizza Palermo is a very basic pizza shop in Shadyside. Although I do think their pizza is delicious and fresh, I have eaten there twice now and service is very slow. For two hoagies, we waited over a half an hour and it was about 8pm during the week, and only two other people were in the restaurant. In addition to pizza, I'd recommend their cheese fries! However, the buffalo chicken wrap and the barbecue wings both left a lot to be desired. With so many pizza shops in the area, it's hard to find what stands out about this one."}
{"text":"Always hot, yummy pizza delivered! Nice alternative to Dominos, but you pay a bit more for it!"}
{"text":"This is where we order all of our delivery pizza from. We pretty much order pizza, hoagies, and sometimes wings. We order online since you get free breadsticks. I usually freeze the breadsticks and then we pull them out if we want some as a quick side for a meal. 

The pizza is typical delivery pizza. I actually feel like all of the pizza places that deliver around here have pretty much cloned pizza. It all is so similar. Every time we get food from here, it comes hot, and it usually takes about an hour for delivery. I just expect that, but sometimes it comes faster. It's like a bonus. 

Their buffalo chicken stuff is really good. I love the hot sauce they use. It's not really a buffalo sauce, but it's a really good hot sauce and it's pretty hot. I thought it was just special for their hoagies, but it's what they use for the hot wings too. Definitely hotter than a typical hot wing. The hot sauce alone makes it worth ordering things from Palermo."}
{"text":"I regularly order stuff here.  I am a big fan of the Alfredo chicken and broccoli.  They do a good job at it.  Taste great and the seasoned chicken strip is good.  I like their spaghetti as well.  The hot sausage they have is pretty good.  I also like their Angus bacon burger.  Their fries are surprisingly good if it gets delivered in time.  The chef salad is good.  So is the antipasto.

Some of their sandwiches are good.  Their steak sandwiches are not.  The meat they use sucks and the sandwich was bland in general.  Their garlic bread sucks too.  Doesn't taste like garlic bread.  It didn't even taste like butter.

Overall, they got some bland dishes got plenty of good ones."}
{"text":"When Pizza Palermo first moved in to the old KFC location, I was skeptical. With a slogan like \"Its X-Traordinary!\" I wasn't very hopeful. The fact that their takeout special of a large pizza with one topping went up a buck within the first couple of weeks wasn't exactly a confidence booster, either. But, as things will happen, I finally got curious enough to give it a shot a few months after its initial opening.

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the pizza here. The sauce is a little on the sweeter side, the cheese is just greasy enough, and the dough isn't overly chewy. The pies I've had with pepperoni have been quite good, and the Italian sausage that Palermo's uses is mildly spicy, which I found to be a nice surprise. I also like the little cup of ranch dressing you get with every pizza. It complements the taste of the slices nicely.

The breadsticks are also quite good with just enough of a garlic dusting and not overly greasy. However, the rest of the stuff I have had at Pizza Palermo is just mediocre. The chicken wings are nothing to get excited about. They taste exactly like you would imagine them to. Kind of gummy (they're not fried here) with too much sauce dumped on top (a little BBQ sauce goes a long way, guys) and a bit of stretchy skin. Meh.

The sandwiches are hit and miss as well. The first time I had the steak and ranch hoagie, it was rather tasty. The second time there wasn't as much meat and not enough dressing on it, so it was rather dry. The chicken parm hoagie was a complete miss. It's made with chicken tenders, most of the ones which wound up on mine were rubbery and had way too much gristle on them. Pass.

The staff here is friendly, and whether I've ordered by phone or line, the quoted time to pick it up given to me was always correct. This is usually an average of 20 minutes. In fact, every time I've gone in to pick up my order, it was ready before I even got there, so I will say that these guys are efficient at cranking out ordes for pickup. I haven't tried delivery, so I can't comment on that.

There are some tables at this location, but it doesn't really feel like a place you'd want to eat in, just as much as the old KFC there was mainly about takeout. It is nice and clean though, probably more so than when it was a KFC, so if you do decide to eat here, you don't have to worry about crummy tables, sticky floors and the like.

So pizza and breadsticks = good, and everything else = done better elsewhere. I do like how close this location is to my apartment, but then I'm kind of in the center of everything in Crafton, so location is never much of something to complain about for me. But if you're looking for pretty tasty pizza, Pizza Palermo is good, so give it a shot."}
{"text":"The worst Italian food I have had in a very long time.

The eggplant parmigiana came as a big massive mixed up soggy spaghetti noodles with marinara mixed in like some old slop house, I didn't find any kind of eggplant in there I added a meatball and it was all chopped up mixed in and the flavor was bland and mediocre. The whole thing was soggy mass.

They were kind enough to send a large order of breadsticks they were fine.

I think I spent about $25 and I wouldn't have paid $4 for the whole thing."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time today for delivery. The food came on time and was fresh. Very polite on the phone and the driver was a  really nice guy too. Definitely would order again!!"}
{"text":"They have the best pizza in the area (which is served with ranch dressing).  Actually their ranch is so good I think they put crack in it.  I also have a mini love affair with their onion rings every time I order them.  Basically everything Italian on the menu that I've tried has been great but their wings could use some work."}
{"text":"Hot and gooey and cheesy with a crunchy crust which is exactly what I look for in a slice.  The slices are huge!  

Filling and delicious and they have lunch specials too!  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Most terrible experience ever..I found a living worm in my chicken Calzone..will never order anything from them again..watch out!"}
{"text":"Not a good first experience. Pizza had no flavor, garlic sauce on bread sticks ran onto all our pizza boxes. very long line and customer were very angry. They literally picked up and hung up on multiple customer's. Talk about bad customer service. What a shame I was looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"Friendly service (on phone, for delivery only), friendly manager who delivers and great pizza, Pizza Palermo doesn't disappoint.
We order from here almost everyday for work meetings. The salads are fresh and can be customized to every ingredient level. 1 star subtracted since sometimes the instructions aren't followed to a T , but ah well!"}
{"text":"Ordered large pepperoni pizza and wings. When I got home I noticed that there was no pepperoni. Wasn't too happy about but after calling the pizza. They said that they wouldn't deliver correct order since I live 20 min away. Manager Ali said that he can offer me double pepperoni next time. Lol what a joke. There will be no next time. Pizza was meh, wings were dry. But even worse that Customer service was bad. ;) Save yourself some time and buy your pizza from Slice on Broadway"}
{"text":"We ordered from here for the first time tonight. The delivery was very fast and the driver was pleasant. The food was hot and fresh and tasted really delicious. It came with an amazing order of free bread sticks for online order. We will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I work at a local school and ordered food as a reward for my students.  I was a little nervous because I ordered online and needed it by 10:45.    I was heading towards the office when the delivery guy called at 10:43.  He was super friendly.  I already paid online, so it was an easy transaction.   The kids loved the hoagies and we even got free breadsticks!   I will definitely be ordering from there again!  Thank you Pizza Palermo, from a new customer."}
{"text":"This is one of the better pizza spots in Pittsburgh to order from.  Their menu is so extensive that I am fairly sure that any one person in the city would be able to find something that will put their hunger at bay.

I opted once for their fries with cheese and bacon on them.  This falls under their appetizers portion of the menu, but honestly it could be a menu item all on its own.  It is a healthy portion (that may sound oxymoronic) of fries.  You get to pick the cheese you want those fries to be smothered in and then crumbled bacon tops that off.  I almost always opt for the cheese sauce, that way I am guaranteed that the cheese makes its way to the bottom of the fries as well.  When I first ordered this item, I made the mistake of ordering another item on the menu and I should have just stuck with the fries.  They are more than enough.

I have had an array of items from the menu, but the fries are what stuck with me.  This may end up being my go to place when I can't decide what I want to snack on.

Staff are polite when you order, if you get delivery they are quite speedy.  One thing to know for delivery: $1 delivery fee."}
{"text":"Extremely nice on the phone. Ordering was quick and easy. Delivery was super quick which was surprising with the time that I placed my order. I ordered a small Steak Calzone and it tasted amazing. Definitely recommend to anyone in the Crafton area. Easily one of my favorites around."}

{"text":"The last time I stop to get takeout I noticed a cockroach on the floor I had to tell the manager. Luckily he picked it up with a paper towel and threw it away. I thought I'd give it another chance, but today when I went to pick up my pizza. The lady was short change and told me 

\"I'm sorry I don't have enough change to give you.\"

I've never seen anything like it before in my life."}

Big choice of speciality pies and hoagies.  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Ordered from them through an online delivery service once last year and despite of the generally good reviews here, the experience was largely disappointing. Food was average and the two delivery kids were acting like clowns. Apart from being able to get food from them later than anyone else, there really was no upside to it."}
{"text":"I called for delivery as I'm staying a local hotel 800 feet away.  When placing my order I explained this to the person on the other line.  He asked for the address twice even though I said I'm at the (name provided) hotel 800 feet away.  I decided to not order after a couple attempts of providing the address that this restaurant had to have delivered to in the past."}

I picked up the phone for the first time tonight to call in and the lady at Palermo answered the phone and I swear she said this \"You don't have to keep calling back every five minutes, Maam.\" I sat there confused for a second and then I asked \"what are you talking about?\" She repeated herself. I said \"This is the first time I've called you this evening.\" I gave her my phone number and address and she said \"You have ordered before because I have all your information right here.\" I tried to explain to her that WE ORDER ALL THE TIME, but this was the first time I called Palermo tonight!! Then, instead of apologizing, she asked me if I was placing an order. I told her that I wasn't, that I would be leaving a review instead. Her name is Melissa and she should not be in customer service. I don't know who the person was who kept calling them tonight, but she confused me with them. It doesn't matter who they were either because she should not be talking to any customers that way, let alone me who called 1 time."}
{"text":"As the old adage goes, \"you pay for what you get.\" This is true of Pizza Palermo. The food is reasonably priced and thus tastes reasonable. Don't expect to be blown away...this isn't the best pizza in Pittsburgh (see Aiello's, Mercurio's, or Il Pizaiolo for that), but it still tastes good and is super convenient if you live in Shadyside. I would, however, recommend getting toppings on the pizza. For some reason the plain cheese pizza comes out pretty greasy. The hoagies are also solid. Definitely recommended. As far as pizza goes, you could do A LOT worse in this town."}
{"text":"I've been to Pizza Palermo a couple of weeks back and while the staff seems really nice and friendly, the food just left me feeling meh.
I had the steak calzone and opted for having it in.
First up, I know this is not a \"restaurant\", but would proper cutlery and proper plates be too much to ask for? The calzone itself was quite hard and I struggled cutting it with my little plastic knife. On top of that the paper plates were soaked through after 1 minute making me paranoid eating the plate too. The calzone itself tasted pretty bland, there was not much flavor to it and I basically drowned it in ketchup just because I was hungry and I paid $14 for it. And to call something a \"steak\" calzone when in reality you put in a couple of slices of what seemed to be dry roast beef slices, is just unacceptable.
I am not really sure what their 'specialty' is as they must do something right reading all the other reviews. But, I don't think I will be back as there are many, many pizza places serving better food than Pizza Palermo."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually order from Pizza Palermo on those nights we're too tired to cook and need dinner delivered.  EVERYTHING is good, especially the Italian Hoagie.  HUGE, and tasty!  They promise a 45 minute delivery, but the food usually comes within a half hour.  (Delivery guys are very polite and professional.) As a bonus, if you order on-line (more than $20.00) you get a free medium-sized pizza box of bread-sticks with marinara sauce.  We save the bread-sticks for breakfast the next day; sliced and toasted.  (Two meals for from one order.)"}
{"text":"I'm just going to get to the point I had the steak calzone it look pretty but it was the worst thing I've ever spent $14 on. No seasoning on the steak the mushrooms and onions were not sauté they just cut them an through them into my calzone.
This calzone is so bad its to the point where I want you to buy it just to taste it just so you can see how bad it is Never Again!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is just ...... These people seem like they hate their jobs. If you don't like your job please close. The food is not that good to deal with their attitudes. Seriously, the attitudes here stink !"}
{"text":"I continue to be impressed with the quality and service of Pizza Palermo.  Honestly at this point from my experiences in the area, I see ne reason to order from anywhere else.  The pizza is outstanding, but I do like my sauce a bit on the sweet side, and this is not that.  But the cheese, texture of the crust and amount of toppings are spot on.  Great pizza of you are one of the mid-size crust, cheese loving type.  Their subs are pretty darn good too.  And go with the delux instead of the regular.  Their online ordering is easy and you get free breadsticks if the order is over 20.00.  I buy a 20.00 lottery ticket everyday, but I'd rather have a pizza and sub special at Palermo.  Ownership and staff are of the foreign type, but they really have great customer service and delivery drivers.  only time I was a bit disappointed was with the Gyro and fries.  But who goes to a ballet expecting a Steelers game.  Great spot and prices are a bit higher, but the quality is far superior to PH. Dm's or PJ's."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and over priced. Pizza is soggy and their attitude stinks. Order food from there and for a group working at the hospital and the delivery guy didn't give the right money back and the order was wrong. When called they refused to fix the order and give us what money they owed us."}
{"text":"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE 

I work at an high school. Teacher's lunch breaks are only 25 mins (very short) . I called and placed my order hour before my break and told them the exact time I went on break so that it could be here in time , along with the address to the school.For some reason the driving went to the wrong school stating he was outside already 12 mins into my lunch break , so when he finally already arrived to my location merely minutes before my lunch was over I called to see if i could have some type of discount . The worker refused and made it as if it was my fault. I refuse to do business with an inconsiderate company !"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here. The pizza is really fresh, and is almost always delivered before the time they quote you, and on top of that it isn't as expensive as inferior pizzas in the area. Definitely suggest to anyone considering eating from here."}
{"text":"1st: Pizza was cold. I called and was told, \"it's because it's cold outside.\" Huh? Okay, so note to self: never order pizza in the winter from here (for delivery) because there's no guarantee your pizza will be REMOTELY warm. 

2nd: the pizza was burnt and they act as if they couldn't understand what I was stating. Soooo, I took the pizza back; although they did advise it would take 40-45mins, to get the new one. Why wait 40-45 mins to run the risk of cold pizza, again. 

3rd: all of that for it to be subpar. It's been real!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars at Pizza Palermo since fall of 2016. We order from them at least once a week. The staff is very friendly and they always welcome us when we come in and talk to us like they've known us for years. Service is fast and I recommend you call in your order so it's ready to be picked up when you arrive :) Also another perk is that they're always open during holidays and hours are late so good for when you need some food in your stomach after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Very good pizza at a very reasonable price! I got mine to go, but they have ample seating and located on a nice corner lot. Two big screen tv's to enjoy the games or news while you wait or eat.  Restroom was clean and had an open stall and stand up urinal, but with a locking door. I bought a huge XL pepperoni pie for under $14.00 tax included. We leave here Tuesday and will probably get another pie before we do. Also the pies come with a container of house made ranch dressing that was great for dipping the bones in. Try it, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We moved to this area 9 months ago and so far this has been my favorite pizza place in the area. Order online and the breadsticks are free. They have lots of options to create your own pie. My last two orders I went with bacon, banana peppers and extra sauce...so good. Currently I am afraid to veer away from these guys because the other places I've tried have been pretty bland."}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem. The pizza is good (especially with ranch) and the breadsticks are amazing."}
{"text":"I had wings and a pie. The wings was over fried and way to greasy . The pie was a 5/10 . Not really a lot of flavor. Service was horrible!! Was like I was a burden to them. Not coming back"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the pizza being the least impressive of their entire menu. Despite being quite expensive, they are absolutely obnoxious about charging for every little thing or making changes. I ordered spaghetti and wanted half white and half red sauce and got a call saying they \"couldn't do that.\" You mean you literally, physically cannot substitute half of the red sauce and add a little bit of white sauce? Really? She said would have to \"charge me for it.\" You would have to charge me extra for the same quantity of sauce? Why, because of all the extra exerted effort? Same thing for any sort of sauce for wings, breadsticks, whatever. And, yes. They charge $0.75 for a tiny cup of sauce. 

I mean, if you want to pay $35 for a pizza dinner this is a good option. The hoagies are especially good. However, you can get much better for much cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Working overnights at the hospital means needing delicious food to cope with the dragging hours of 1AM and beyond. Luckily, Pizza Palermo deliver until 1:45AM, so we were able to get an assortment of hoagies, calzones, pastas, and gyros without any trouble. Not a single person had a complaint about the taste, portion size, quality, or speed of delivery - pretty good when we ordered for 10 people. 

I had the Italian calzone, and it was quite delicious - mega meaty, complimented by melty provolone and ricotta - but it was also quite greasy, and the grease was not well contained in the pizza box, resulting in grease-covered scrubs... minus one star for that, and for being about 1 dollar too expensive. Despite those sour points, I will undoubtedly order from there again - my coworkers wouldn't have it any other way.

PS- just remembered that I also have had an Italian Deluxe hoagie from these guys, and that would also be worth ordering again without hesitation - again, mega meaty and great complimentary flavors from the toppings. It's no Real McCoy, but seriously, nothing is, so this is the best thing out there post-1AM and close to the best any other time."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was awesome. We got the online deluxe hoagie special.  The price was great, our food came fast. The deluxe steak hoagie is a new favorite."}
{"text":"This place is terrible !
I ordered food from them and driver calls my phone I don't have it on me and by the time I see the missed call he's gone !
Never came to the door ! 
I called to ask what's up and they wanted to bring back cold food with no discount!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is WAY overpriced and only average at best. I bought 2 large pizzas (nothing crazy) a pepperoni and veggie on a Tues during their 8.99 special and my total came to $32.89. The total is $23 for a large veggie pizza.  wow. Just wow. One other one i was here i over heard the crew complain that I did not tip for an order I picked up with my own car. There is no way in hell I will ever be returning to this dump again."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Crafton! We have ordered here since they opened and from day one they have treated us like family.  Our favorite pineapple and bacon pizza is amazing. Delivery is always fast and food is fresh. They understand what it means to \"make the customer happy\" something that is lost in today's economy. Pizza Palermo THANK YOU the only pizza place in the Burgh we trust. Apt 6 Loves you guy's ! Thanks again"}
{"text":"We eat out and order drivers regularly. We've tried every delivery restaurant in Penn Hills and  these folks are the best. Food tastes great, is prepared as ordered and delivered quickly. We won't order delivery pizza/Italian from anywhere else!! Hats off to you for being the best! Love the stuffed shells!! Extensive menu items. They've got something for everyone."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I've gone to so far in Pittsburgh. I've ordered quite a few pies here and what makes it even better is that it comes with a side of homemade ranch! That just makes the pizza taste even better. I've only ordered delivery from here and it has never taken longer than an hour to come and always hot and ready to eat. I do wish the delivery had just a tad shorter wait, but the connivence of not having to leave your place while still being able to eat some delicious pizza eventually, I can't really complain much."}
{"text":"We needed a quick place to grab dinner and Pizza Palermo was nearby.   The employees were very helpful in identifying what we should try as out-of-towners.  Pizzas were great, fried zucchini was good, calzone was the size of a football.  

Thumbs up!  Highly recommend Pizza Palermo."}
{"text":"This pizza place is right near my apartment, so it's incredibly convenient. It's also delicious!!! The ranch is so good. I always ask for extra. They are also very nice. Once they messed up my order and never cooked it. Two hours later I called and they were very apologetic and brought me my order free of charge. It is not my favorite pizza place in the city, but for the price and type of pizza I'm looking for on an everyday pizza hunt, it's definitely the best!"}
{"text":"Been eating their pizza for about 10 years because close to work. Last two times making me look elsewhere. Pie today tasted like cheap spaghetti sauce on dough with very little cheese. Supposed to be16 cut pepperoni pizza with two sides of their ranch dressing. Got no ranch and only 21 pieces of pepperoni on whole pie. Tasted like school cafeteria pizza. Too many shops in area to pay hood money gor bad food, paid 18.00 for bad pizza"}
{"text":"Forget this place. Service is slow, staff disorganized and after a very long wait, the employee walked out, I thanked him for the food and was met by silence and his back as he walked away after plopping this marginal at best Italian sub in the table. 

So here is the scoop on the sub, baked roll with a small portion of meat (if you are charging me 8 bucks for half a sub...you may want to consider a bit more substance to it). The Italian dressing was right out of a bottle. Another thing I look for is some type of home made dressing for subs. It wouldn't kill these dudes to make a vinegar and oil based dressing with a few herbs. 

I think this was a one time visit. I may have considered trying the pizza but acting like the customer is a pain, poor service and just rude employees isn't enough for me to buy your crap."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their recent service, and I used to be a regular. Ordered an extra large for guests at an event. After 40 mins I got a call from the rather rude driver who was at the billing address instead of the delivery address and wanted to charge me an extra $5 for delivering to the right address. I called the restaurant and they said they'd send him over. He took an extra 15 mins to arrive with an incomplete order, since I had also asked for extra plates and cutlery (which I generally forgo when ordering for myself). Driver showed me the receipt he had which was for an old order I placed weeks ago (it seems that they don't even check the details on new orders and simply use old orders you gave) and kept arguing about how they weren't wrong about the order even when I showed him my online receipt. Terrible service and I'm going to think twice about ordering again even though the pizza is decent."}
{"text":"When you have that 2am food craving after a long time of drinking, this place won't let you know. We came in here at 2:30am and they were still open, with plenty of people inside. Other places were closed, but Pizza Palermo was not. Plenty of workers churning out delicious pies.

3 of us got the XL Meat Pie and oh my lord was it amazing. I thought it was going to be one of those sad cheese pizzas but wow it was delicious. Super satisfying

Recommend:
- Call ahead of time. We felt like newbies waiting while others called in their orders ahead of us.
- They have sandwiches too. Pizza was delicious though. 
- Limited Parking so park on the street."}
{"text":"I would like to think of myself as Pizza Palermo's #1 customer. This is not only my late night (2 am) go to, but it is also my \"I don't feel like cooking tonight, let's order pizza\" joint. 

We love the Buffalo Ranchero Chicken Pizza. If you order online, you also receive free breadsticks-how can you beat that deal?! 

Ordering from the Center Ave location during the day/early evening is very quick; however, ordering late night can take a bit longer. 

Whatever time you enjoy eating your pizza & breadsticks, I would highly enjoy ordering from Pizza Palermo! (P. S. Tell them they're number one customer recommended you ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm from California but visit Pittsburgh (Penn Hills) pretty often since this is where my husband grew up. We have tried many pizza places out here and Pizza Palermo is by far the best pizza I have had while being out here! Free breadsticks when you order online and they are sooooo good! Hope these guys stick around so I can have it when I come back here."}
{"text":"Great hoagies. The Italian hoagie was huge and had a nice amount of meat and stuffings. The bread was great too. Small little place right on Lysle Blvd I McKeesport. Easy to find and seemed to be extremely busy!"}
{"text":"I usually order from them online and they follow my written direction so well I feel very respected :)))))))))))
I love their pizza, wings--sauce is never over done but just right (bbq--never had other flavors), and subs--they toast the bread! ooooooooh I love it! Their pastas are goood too! yum!
One time I requested to make french fries crispy and oooohhh yeahhh it was soooo crisp!
Their deliver is fast usually takes about 30 min.

This is my favorite local pizza store in Pgh that delivers! Yayyyy!


Update: I wonder if the owner has changed because the pizza taste signicanly different in a not so good way."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Was staying with friends and called for delivery at 9pm. 2 and a half hours later the food finally arrives and my seafood fettuccine Alfredo had no Alfredo sauce and the shrimp was dehydrated and the imitation crab was burnt. When I called about the quality of the food I received a sharp \"what do you want me to do?\"   Will never get food from here again and would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Pizza Palermo is my favorite pizza shop in Pittsburgh. Food tastes great and delivery is always quickly. I really impressed customer service, manager and drivers a so friendly.  5 stars for this great pizza shop!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time getting take out from here. When you actually eat at the restaurant. They actually take care of you, but the take out is a whole other thing. They say 45 min and I don't expect them to be actually precise but it was am hr  and a half. And the pizza and wings were horrible. There's better pizza places out there For your value. Like Portofinos. Betos and.fioris top the list"}
{"text":"Pizza uncooked, but crust is dark, and taste is too saucy, and tell your driver to give more attention for online order tickets. Especially on red part, cause driver was nice, fast, but this mistake will be repeated again. Comparing cheese to sauce is terrible, and dough was uncooked..."}
