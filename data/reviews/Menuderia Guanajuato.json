{"text":"I have been a Menudo fanatic for many, many years. I've eaten it in various parts of Mexico, LA, Chicago, and Phoenix. I can without question say that the Menudo at this place is one of the best I've have. Don't be intimidated by the decor or location. Come and enjoy the Menudo and their other delicious dishes......YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT... If I could I would give this place 10 stars.... Buen provecho...."}
{"text":"The menudo was good but their service really sucked. Not once did they check on us. And to top it all off it wasnt even busy. We were the only ones in there. We took their attitude  like here's your food and don't bother us. So, on and all the food it decent but their service is NOT GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is very good, The closest to my moms menudo and their green chilaquiles are soo good too. Service is not always the best but the owners are very nice. The location is not the best but just try it. You will love it."}
{"text":"The menudo was good. The more wasn't very tasty. It was bland. The service was the worst! The waitress had  an attitude like she didn't want to work. She never returned to our table and asked if we needed anything or wanted refills"}
{"text":"The food was great and the servers were nice.  This place is located in a sketchy neighborhood and it doesnt look like much on the outside but inside is large and clean.    We ordered chicken Enchiladas, chili Relleno and guacamole.   All had great flavor and made more traditional style.  A little too much cheese on the Enchiladas and a little too dry for me but i am sure they would alter the meal of you want.  The guacamole was full of flavor without all that lettuce filler.  Rice was moist and flavorful as well."}
{"text":"If really good menudo is your holy grail, this is where you'll find it. I found their piping-hot menudo to be flavorful, its tripe tender and very well prepared. With a sprinkle  of chopped onion and cilantro that come on the side and with a squeeze of a lime wedge, you transform a peasant dish into something almost royal.  I also ordered their chicken enchilada, a rich entree which came out to be a very generous portion. Don't expect an elegant atmosphere, as this place is very basic. But definitely come here for some of the best Mexican food in the Valley. And while most of the staff may have difficulty with English, you will have no problem conversing with the affable young lady at the counter who will take your order and guide you through the menu."}
{"text":"It was quite a relief to find out that my favorite menuderia had not disappeared, but rather just moved to another location. The menudo rojo is still the best I've had in the Valley and for that alone the drive to this newer location is worth it. I also tried their pastor and asada tacos - quite decent, and more generously filled than those in most taquerias. The service is friendly and the restaurant itself is roomier than it was in its previous incarnation. Also, parking is not an issue, unlike in its previous location along McDowell."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem... if you want handmade tortillas and real authentic dishes, I recommend trying this place out. I know others say the service is subpar but the food more then makes up for it, I wouldn't say they are rude by any means though. My overall experience was excellent. You see tons of Native people eating here because it's truly authenic!"}
{"text":"Best menudo in town !! Their food is also amazing and authentic! I recommend the tortas here ! Salsa is spicy and has a good kick to it!"}
{"text":"The food was bomb. The service was honestly great. The waitress was not very talkative but she was definitely not rude by any means. The rice and beans tasted as if they were homemade. The place surprisingly was really clean. Would definitely come back. Not sure what the or ions people that posted were talking about."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a weekend for a bowl of menudo.  My expectations might have been a little excessive, based on the reviews.  I thought it was a solid bowl of menudo, and well-priced, but that was it.  The service was attentive and pleasant, and the broth was good (could have been a little hotter though, temperature-wise).  You get all the extras you need to jazz it up (chopped onion & cilantro, lime wedges, and hot sauce).  The tripe was very tender.  I ordered it with corn tortillas, which are thick and clearly made on the premises (they had a little bit of char to them).  I haven't comparison-shopped with other menuderias, and maybe this place shines by comparison to them.  But overall, I thought it was just good, not great."}
{"text":"amazing natural juice varying from carrot to orange alongside their delicious menudo! completely recommend their other delectable  dishes 10/10 in a very inviting and amiable environment. Being familiar with traditional Mexican food it is safe to say that they bring a amazing touch of Guanajuato into their culinary."}
{"text":"Right off the bat.. a drama filled novela was on the tv.. a good sign.. super clean place. The chips are home made. The salsa didnt seem to be. Chips like these deserve great salsa.  Her ordered a pastor burrito it came loaded.. a two hander.. the meat was tasty but it had beans and rice in theee too... too much for her she ate half.  The menudo was HOT.. all the fixings and spices were just right.. I could have done without the pata. All in all i wouldnmake it back.. they had capirotada.. a seasonal favorite mother loves that I do not care for but a lot of folks need during easter.. Good bowl of menudo. Great hospitality. ."}
{"text":"I'm have very particular taste buds when it comes to Menudo but honestly thus is one of the best I've had in a long time. Not only is it fresh but the meat is not full of fat like most menudos are. Tortillas are homemade and delicious...."}
{"text":"Menuderia Guanajuato (if memory serves me correct), sits next door to the site of a now defunct Lawnmower Repair business. As a child, I remember passing by Larry's Lawnmowers quite often. Sadly I can't remember what business occupied the building before the owners of Menuderia Guanajuato took it over; however, I am glad that they have vacated the premises.  In central Phoenix, there appears to be a glut of stores that end in the suffix \"-eria\", e.g. panaderia, carneceria, and floreria (bread store, meat store, flower shop respectively). I assumed, and rightfully so, that since the owners decided to name their restaurant as an ode to a single dish, I simply had to stop by and sample the pièce de résistance. This humble little restaurant seemed intimidating at first. The front doors open to the middle of the seating area, where hungry patrons devour the signature dish. Though ambiance is seriously lacking, I suspect that the regulars who frequent the establishment do not venture here for the elegant frescoes that cover the walls. Of course I am being facetious. Clearly the masterpiece comes in a large bowl, served with your choice of toasted bread or corn tortillas and the regular accompaniments: citrus, cilantro, and chopped onion. Also, hot red chile sauce is served on the side for those who prefer a little spicy kick to their bowl.    The Menudo here is simply outstanding. It's reminiscent of the soup my abuelitos prepared for us as children: the meat tender, yet firm, combined with the proper hominy ratio. Depending on preference, the Menudo can be ordered without corn and/or the inclusion of beef feet. The cooks here season the broth to perfection, creating a piquant masterpiece. They also clean the tripe religiously. I dislike Menudo, made with tripe that hasn't been cleaned properly, as it can leave the broth greasy and unappealing. Suffice to say that I've yet to have a bad bowl here. Of course the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired; however, my patronage isn't dependent on the lack of amenities. As their namesake suggests, they do one thing extremely well. I tend to favor a large bowl of red Menudo with corn, served with a toasted bolillo roll, and a large piece of hoof.  Of course I add the citrus, onions, and cilantro after I am able to inhale the delicate aroma set before me. I'm not sure if Menudo is an acquired taste, if so...thank you Lord for your benevolence! I had taken to preparing the soup at home, due to lack of quality options in the supermarket. The canned variety simply pales in comparison and the mediocre offerings in some hot deli cases leaves a lot to be desired. The 4 to 7 hours I've saved of prep/cook time is duly appreciated. The wait staff can get overwhelmed at times, though I am not sure how big of a role inexperience plays into that fact. If time is of the essence, the restaurant does take phone orders. Overall, it's become my favorite establishment where I can enjoy a bowl of that spicy concoction of beef tripe and hominy, Menudo!"}
{"text":"Wow....found this little gem while looking for a real authentic Menudo.  The food here was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp is my go too when I am looking for a place to eat or to get an idea of what to expect at a certain place, I've turned to Yelp for years but never signed up until now. Menuderia Guanajuato has made me want to write a review! This place is amazing. I came across it on Yelp. My co workers and I are always looking for something to eat since we are limited to places near our work area. Let me tell you, this isnt close and it takes us our whole lunch time to travel, pick up our food, and get back, but so worth it!. The menudo is amazing! This is true authentic Mexican food. The corn tortillas are hand made! The masa for the sopes and gorditas too! You can smell and taste the fresh corn masa when you are biting into them. The red chicken enchiladas are bomb! The chilaquilles, the mole, the rice! Everything I have ordered has been delish! Beware, the read salsa is stright poison! LOL. I had tears rolling down my eyes and a runny nose the whole time I was eating but couldnt stop being as it was so good. I would truly recommend this spot. Dont expect anything fancy, it's a small little house turned into a resturant, bright lime green with limited parking...but oh so worth it!"}
