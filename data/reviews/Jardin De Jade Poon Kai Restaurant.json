{"text":"This review is based on the TAKE-OUT at Jardin de Jade Poon Kai.  The restaurant's take out area is always bombarding with people. They have a mass selection of huge buns, dumplings, egg tarts, sticky rice, and so much more. The prices are very cheap, and to be honest, their selection tastes really good. Hubby and I eat the dumplings and sticky rice quite often because it is very tasty and flavourful. I haven't tried their buffet, but for its price, I want to try it one day.  Jardin's egg tarts are one of the best I've had in Montreal: very fluffy, soft, and just sweet enough. If you want to try Jardin but don't want to try their buffet, try ordering a few items from their take out kiosk - you can eat comfortably at home while you get your tasty Chinese food! Note: their take out menu is really difficult to find; you generally have to ask the workers what is what (ie. what type of bun is that?)."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing dinner.  We were really looking forward to a nice dinner in Chinatown.  My wife ordered white wine, got red (advertised as Auberge) that was almost certainly homemade swill.  After asking for a banana smoothie the second time, I got a slushie.  I'm sure that the slushy had never been within 200 yards of a banana.  Many of the food choices had no labels, so God only knows what some of the dishes were.  The food was not even mediocre; bland, bland, bland.  Come on people - you can do better than that."}
{"text":"You don't expect a gourmet meal at a Chinese buffet. But this was so awful we are still kicking ourselves for having chosen it over all the other possible alternatives. On the positive side, the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I eat here every couple of months, when I'm in the mood to stuff my face with as much food as possible for under $12 including tax and tip (2pm special). Coming here is like playing the lottery. Will you win or will you lose? Is the food today going to be good or is it going to be crap?   Whenever you go, there'll be at least a few dishes which aren't totally gross. There are some that, even just by the look of them, you know are going to be totally gross. Do not take the hard boiled eggs! They are ALWAYS hard and gross. Ditto the red bean tong sui.  4.5* to the separate bakery section at the other door. 90c pork buns FTW!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for less then 20 dollars each. This is not a fancy Chinese restaurant. You pay what you get, and don't expect to eat like a king with 20 dollars. Special hours only cost 10 dollars each what were expecting? Fancy Chinese food for 10 dollars? So many stupid stupid reviews. You can't get even two burgers from AW for 10 dollars. Shut up pretentious reviewers. Want fancy food? Pay more at fancy restaurants."}
{"text":"C'est un vrai buffet chinois c'est-à-dire que rien n'est vraiment bon tout juste acceptable mais au fur et à mesure que les années passent le buffet retraici à vue d'il.   En plus, il faut se battre pour que les plats sales soient retirés de la table.   Une chance que le prix est bas"}
{"text":"I read other people's comments about the buffet of this restaurant, as a Chinese I have to say some of the comments are not so true for me.  Because for me, the food here is quite authentic Chinese food.    The Chinese food in the local Chinese restaurants are not so authentic.  I guess that's why local people here prefere those not so authentic Chinese food.  The mussels are not so good because in China people don't eat them,  The beef is fat is because it's the belly part.  And actually I'm a fan of beef belly, that's the most tasty part.  So I guess it depends everyone's taste.  I don't think westeners really like authentic Chinese food so much.  The flavor of the chinese food in western countrys is all modified according to the taste of westeners."}
{"text":"I don't expect much in buffets, but both times I've eaten here I regretted it. I end up eating rice and steamed vegetables because the meat dishes are generally disgusting. They DO steam their vegetables to perfection, hence the two starts! The jasmine tea is good, the deserts are nasty. Unless you're starving and desperate for an all-you-can-eat meal for under 20$, stay away!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would've done that. The only slightly redeeming quality of this place is that the staff were nice, otherwise I am almost at a loss for words for how bad this place was.   For those looking for some dirty Chinese food, and think that a place can't be that bad despite all the reviews telling you otherwise, let me just warn you now that you would be wasting your time going there. I hesitate to even call it food; the food was mostly too unappealing to even try, and the food that I actually dared to try was probably the most appalling stuff I have ever had the displeasure of placing in my mouth. The fried chicken was all fat, the noodles were tasteless, the buns were rock hard...etc.   After having a few bites and finding myself unable to stomach it, we got up, paid our bills, and went down the street for some actually edible Chinese food."}
{"text":"I came here the other day and it was ok not great you pay a cheap price for cheap food. i would recommend an other place instead of here."}
{"text":"This is not the best Chinese buffet that I have been to, but it is also not bad - in fact I discovered some new dishes here that I had not seen in any other Chinese buffett.  It is located in Montreal's tiny Chinatown, which is mostly Vitenamese and Laotian, but the place offers decent food at excellent prices and it is one of those places that one always eats too much for too little and then is thirsty from all the salty food for the next 48 hours.  The mussels and garlicked octopus were as good as any that I've had anywhere. and I did notice that there were also a few Western dishes (pasta, etc.) but didn't try any.  There were quite a few varieties of soup and the salad bar was really good with a top notch seaweed salad.  There is also a stir fry station and the usual unusual Chinese only dishes like chicken feet...  Excellent service by a cadre of young Chinese girls.  They also have ice cream and fresh fruit and a wide variety of Jello flavors.  Good deal for the money."}
{"text":"I happened to saw one of the comments below saying that THIS IS AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD and I DON'T AGREE. I mean, China is vast maybe there is a city offering food like this but I'd say, where I came from, a buffet like this WON'T SURVIVE unless it's shockingly cheap (I'd say 15-20 CNY TT included maybe? and that's 3-4 in dollars.) We went here b/c we are told it's cheap, and it's true, but I don't think I'd go again.  The service wasn't bad though, we practically tried everything and wasted half of them (I'm feeling sorry now), but nobody said anything or rolled eyes or anything, the guy was friendly, helpful and extremely quick with cleaning left-overs. Maybe I'll try their take-out sometime basing on the reviews."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I don't live near this place or I would be broke and waaaay overweight.  The food itself is actually quite terrible but for whatever reason, my friends and I always find ourselves in there, piling our plates at the buffet, whenever we're in Chinatown.   Tip: don't eat the fries."}
{"text":"There are a lot of bad reviews for this place, but I didn't find it so bad.  The inside of the restaurant is run down, but service was polite and attentive.  The price was cheap.  It's a buffet that offers many, many choices.  Some dishes are better, some are worse.  We went very late at night, and enjoyed that...:  - There were bamboo baskets of dim sum at 10pm. - There is a drink station for coffee, tea (both oolong & jasmine) and fruit drinks.   - They had some very traditional Chinese veggies (nappa, black fungus, yams, etc). - They had a pot of glutenous (sticky) rice in addition to plain and fried. - There were several seafood selections (crab, baby squid, shrimp, fish). - There were traditional gross out dishes (stewed pigs feet, chicken feet, tripe).  I would eat there again, but only during lunch or late night prices ($11.99) since I'm a cheapo."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you know at what time to go. They have different prices depending on the time, and trust me, you don't want to go there for dinner. At dinner time the food has already been sitting there for a long time and it will probably be soggy or cold, BUT, if you go there at around 2 or 3pm it will be cheaper and it will be delicious. Their hot&sour soup is great, they have lots of vegetarian options, a noodle soup bar, even pizza and sushi. You'll eat a lot and you'll have a good meal for cheap if you go there early. Don't expect gourmet Chinese food, of course, it's not that type of place."}
{"text":"The place was not clean, silverware were dirty, food was cold, and some of the plates displayed were dry from just sitting there. Service wasn't good at all, nor was the food. I regret dinning there. To avoid! It's shameful that their quality is so low, with the multitude of restaurants surrounding them, they should step it up. We definitely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We had both just arrived to Montreal and we were both hungry. I gave the final decision to my girlfriend: \"You decide.\"  I have never been so disappointed in my girlfriend. The food was horrid, old, rancid, nameless, and unknown. I don't think it is fair for me to lay blame on my girlfriend, because after all there were many people sitting to eat here, and many seemed to enjoy it. I don't get it. Neither of us understood how there were people in the restaurant eating, and how many of them look satisfied. I regularly eat Chinese food in Toronto, and I feel like I know how Chinese food should taste. The food at Jardin de Jade however was not this food.  The decor was old and dated. The food was old and soggy. Not once did I see anyone refill any of the food, or change any of the hotel pans. They had pizza, which was really a great pleasure, because if it weren't for that pizza, I would have surely passed great hunger later that night.   The service was somewhat good. They made an effort to clear the tables of leftover food, which was a lot at times since the food was truly putrid. Our server was also nice, and refilled the water regularly, which was necessary for me to wash down most of the food. I knew I would be sick that night.  On my way out, to pay the bill, I overheard one of the servers ask one of her guests: \"Do you have a tip for me?\", after they had already settled their bill with the front cashier. I don't know why they gave her any money. For what they paid for horrible food, which would undoubtedly make them both sick, the server should have paid us.  I don't think we will ever understand how people ate that food that night. It was horrible and for that I leave this review as a warning for others.  Don't be fooled. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Worst buffet ever. Food was incredibly greasy and the food tasted extremely bland. Tried to pour out of one of the soy sauce bottles on the table, but it was more of a syrup than a sauce. Gross. Definitely a big mistake going to a buffet in Chinatown when Im sure there a dozens of other places in the area that I would have gladly gave my money to instead."}
{"text":"This place was horrid! When we arrived, the table mats had dirt stains on it, and we contemplated wether to give it a try. Ultimately we did sigh. There's several tables with varying choices of food. I picked out a few random things and my stomach started hurting afterwards. Compared to other all you can eat spots I've gone to in the states, this had less choices and non existent steamed options. At phone point I picked out ice cream and ended up biting into a piece of what looked like from a table. My friend and I only made it to 2 and half plates, so the money was not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Good food, polite waiters,the location is great too but the best thing is its affordable price. They also have a great selection of asian food and their Wonton soup is delicius."}
{"text":"Greasy, questionable interpretations of dishes that did not seem fresh. Even allowing for the difference between Chinese food in different regions, this was  terrible."}
{"text":"I do not come here for the scarey buffet.    Instead, I come here for the cheap and always pleasant bakery area.  While all of the streets are dead quiet in the early morning and Poon Kai is the only storefront open.  Grab some freshly baked items and enjoy them on the red picnic tables out front, on the quiet brick street in the early hours.  There is nothing better than eating a massive steaming sesame ball in the middle of winter.   The two-handed act of devouring the crispy treat, filling your face with warm steam as you enjoy the hearty sweet interior... This entire experience for a dollar coin.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"When I first met my (now) wife, this restaurant is where we went on one of our first dates. The service was good and the food was fantastic. It was a very memorable experience for both of us. Last week we returned to Montreal for the first time in three years and were eager to return to our favorite Chinese buffet.   To say we were disappointed would be a massive understatement.   The food looked like it had been sitting out for days. The vegetables were brown and spoiled. The sauces were syrupy and disgusting. The meats were nauseatingly greasy. The store-bought steamed buns were so old they had fused with the paper they were sitting on.   There was not one dish I can honestly say I enjoyed... and I tried a LOT of dishes. Normally I'd feel guilty at a buffet if I didn't eat everything on my plate before going back for more. Here I felt like I was doing the next guy a favor.  The place is now wallpapered with advertisements for an assortment of absurdly extravagant alcoholic drinks (we're talking umbrellas, dry ice, and fruit wedges). I have to assume pushing these overpriced novelties is their focus now - serving good food certainly is not.  Absolutely disgusting. The only redeeming aspect is how quick they are to refill your drink... and you're going to need a lot of refills to wash the taste out of your mouth. Avoid."}
{"text":"First time here for late-night dinner. The food was slightly cold and the waiter told me to heat it up in the microwave.  Service was slow, and the food was just bad... Although for just about 13$ you can fill up your stomach.  Please don't come here unless you are desperate for food at 11pm."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Food over cooked, some too salty, some not so fresh. Peeling over cooked shrimps is an over night task, then when done peeling there is nothing left to eat and savor. Service was fine. Chairs you don't want to touch affraid you might permanantly stick to it."}
{"text":"Dès que je cherche un endroit où manger et boire avec des amis, je me réfère toujours à Yelp. Toujours. Alors pourquoi je ne fais pas pareil quand il s'agit de me trouver un endroit où dîner ?! J'avais terriblement faim, je voulais quelque chose de pas cher, alors quand j'ai vu le buffet à volonté de ce Resto chinois, a 10,85$ après 14h, je n'ai pas réfléchi longtemps. Erreur ! Même si le buffet est gigantesque, avec plein de choix, les plats ne sont pas très bon. Les pâtes sont sèches à force d'avoir attendu, comme les bouchées au porc. Un seul choix de makis, des viandes en sauce avec plus d'os que de la viande... La seule chose bonne ? Le canard laqué.  En plus la climatisation était à fond et j'ai eu très très froid.  En résumé, certes ce n'est pas cher, mais pour le même prix mieux vaut aller déguster un ramen un peu plus loin :/"}
{"text":"Why doesn't Yelp let us give 0 stars? Because giving this place one star would be beyond generous. We walked into this buffet expecting to eat some delicious Chinese food and not hair....that's right my friend found hair in the food! Absolutely gross and disgusting and definitely lost my appetite at that point. The buffet had a lot of food options, but they did not have signs up to explain what you were eating. I had to guess what the food was by looking at it half the time. Also, the noodles I got were really crispy, as if overcooked or they were left out for days. We spent 17 Canadian dollars for the meal or lack of, so definitely overpriced and not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Americans not wanted here.  I waited for a table, and instead a group of 20+ locals who can in after me were seated first.  Did give me time to look at the buffet, and clearly they did me a favor; as the food looked terrible."}
{"text":"Coming here during the week yields a noticeably different experience...offerings not as fresh as the weekends but still light-years better than the best NYC dares to offer. By no means should this place vanish from anyone's radar, but you'll be best advised to stick to this spot on weekends.  Remember, this comes from someone who thinks Chinese food is a gross failure of the culinary arts. Therefore, feel free to roam about this wonderful buffet spot..on weekends."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing to write home about. The food is edible which is all I ask for a buffet and you care more about quantity. The noodles are ok and there is a decent variety."}
{"text":"After a busy day of walking around Montreal doing touristy things, we were hungry.  My two year old child was no longer scared of the status of lions in Chinatown, so we decided to look for a chinese buffet.  First Chinatown isn't very chinese anymore, there is a lot of Thai and Korean in the area.  Secondly, the Chinese buffet my parents used to take me to as a child, the one with scrumptous food, and horrible washrooms was no longer in existance.  Walking around a bit we went onto Lagauchetiere and stumbled on Jade.  The host had seated all of the asian customers closest to the windows so us whiteys would say - \"If there's asians eating there, then it has to be good\".  Well the marketing ploy worked and we were inside and seated within moments of entering.  The place is huge inside.  You could host a wedding here, and still have left over tables.  As with the seating, the buffet was huge as well.  There were three different tables of dessert and 5-6 of main course dinner items.  I tried to eat a little bit of everything and still stuffed myself like a pig.  Overall, I'd consider the food at Jade better than the Mandarin (and cheaper too!)  However if you can help it, don't use the washroom.  It was disgusting.  Part of the problem is other customers who refuse to flush, and the other part is just general neglect."}
{"text":"La courtoisie engage une connotation étendue mais elle réfléchie une conduite dressée.   La dame à la caisse semble d'une façon cavalière irritée par les commandes, la source même de son commerce!  J'y suis allé à plusieurs reprises, à des intervalles de quelques années. Le service est toujours déplaisant. Toutefois, les dim sums sont généreuses en portion et substance."}
{"text":"I'm amazed some places can stay open for business for so long despite being so clearly consistently horrible. Why oh why didn't I check the Yelp reviews?!  This is the worst buffet I've ever been to. The worst Chinese food I've ever had. The food has clearly been sitting out for hours. Multiple items are unlabelled and the ones that are labelled are pretty much done with Sharpies on a greasy sneeze guard. I've never seen so little effort put into presentation. I'm still having nightmares about the chocolate pudding just plopped into a metal insert. I don't have to tell you what it looked like. Chinese sticky buns (dessert) placed beside meat items because why not, I guess?  And that doesn't even touch on the food. Oh, the food. If only my party had listened to the voice telling us \"Something seems odd about how this tastes...\" 2 out of 3 of us were throwing up within the hour. I will say we both felt MUCH better after this.  The only good part of our dining experience was how much we were able to laugh at how ridiculous the whole place was. Reading terrible reviews from fellow Yelpers got us through part of the night.  I will say our server was quite nice and attentive. Yay.  For the love of all that is holy, stay away. In a busy and bustling Chinatown, we somehow chose this place. Don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"Unfortunately appearance and flavor are at entirely deferent ends of the spectrum at this establishment. Go ahead and get a dollar cheeseburger from mcdonalds. It taste way better than anything I tried to stomach at this place!"}
{"text":"While not the best Chinese buffet I've ever been to, it certainly wasn't the worst by any means.  It's in the middle of Chinatown, so at least the food tasted like it was made by people who know what they are doing.  I tried everything.  And everything tasted good.  But not a lot of it was memorable.  I did get seconds on the chicken feet and the braised short ribs.  But again, not much to write home about.  I read the past reviews of this place and I have to say that all of the dishes looked and tasted fresh as far as I could tell.  And the grease level on most of the dishes seemed within typical expectations at a Chinese buffet.  Not bad.  Not great.  I got full.  And it was cheap."}
{"text":"Jardin de Jade's buffet is open every day of the week. Not only that, this huge Chinatown venue is a banquet facility, and handles dim sum service and karaoke, to boot. Friends and I trooped in for lunch one Sunday, and despite the crowd of locals and tourists, were seated quickly.  There's no Americanized Chinese food in their buffet (uh, you're not in the US), you'll instead find numerous tasty, traditional Cantonese and Szechuan options, including atypical items like Chinese sausage, beef egg stew, congee (yes, like the soup), breadsticks, and PIG FEET - I love pig feet; theirs tasted somewhat sweet! Typical buffet dishes and desserts are there like lo mein, pizza, hot dogs, pudding, jello, and little cakes.  For all the quality food you're going to eat, their pre-tip price-per-head - about C$10; 15% tip expected - is an appetizing bargain. (Credit cards accepted.) Jardin de Jade is a buffet to be reckoned with - stop in!"}
{"text":"Our petite China town is pretty cool here in Montreal.  I ate at JDJPKR, (I use that for short), for lunch today.  There's a massive buffet!  Overall though, I found the quality of food a bit disappointing.  The mussels weren't great, the ginger beef was fatty, even the chicken balls had very little ball in them.  Price was cheap, but I tasted why.  I may try China town again tomorrow...different place!  Does not take Amex."}
{"text":"average food. has a few items rarely found in Canada which is good"}
{"text":"I had a quick meal with my girlfriend before she go to work so we were in a rush... I wonder if they clean once in a while.The food was OK, the service like most of Asian place they don't smile at you and then they expect 15% tips. I gave four dollars for a bill of 29... we ate there one plate each for about 15,20 minutes then we left and the girl in pink give me attitude... if you let your customer heat in a  place dirty like that you deserve less than 15"}
{"text":"After seeing the number of people in the restaurant, I thought that this place would be a winner - after all, all Chinese food must be awesome in Chinatown... right?  Sadly, no...  Although it was a Sat. night at 7 p.m. and the place was busy, the food tasted like it was out since lunch.  I tried a variety of dishes, and found nothing worth mentioning (I stayed away from the chicken feet). Often, I couldn`t even finish what I took... for example, the one chicken ball I took was as hard as a rock (couldn`t cut or bite through it).  I took a bite of fried rice and almost chipped my tooth on a small bone fragment.  I took a couple of fresh-made onion rings that just came out, thinking that they couldn`t screw that up... and they did - it was undercooked and mushy.  I thought the food was prepared without care or flavour and certainly without inspiration.  The decore was equally as run down and dirty.  As someone else mentioned, the water was filled quickly, but there were floaties in the (new) glass.  In the end, I was disappointed to pay $15 plus tax for such a bad experience.  There are probably many other, better places in the area where we could have gone!  Please stay away."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for their highest price buffet.  The food quality was not very good.  The steamed fish and fried fish were probably the best which isn't saying much.  I thought the steamed fish was overcooked as the the fish was stiff.  The vegetarian rolls were soggy not crispy.  Several dishes tasted were overly salty.  The green beans were bland.  The wonton was bland, mostly wonton skin, not much meat and wasn't very tasty.  The little steamed dumplings were good.  The almond cookies, apple pie, ube and strawberry ice cream were not inspiring.  It's really a second or third rate dining experience here.  I don't understand why this place is so popular for such mediocre food.  The waiter service is minimal and slow.  Tip isn't included and I don't believe in tipping at a buffet.  A few individual items were good, but the overall dining experience was disappointing.  I won't be returning and cannot in all honesty recommend this to anybody with the overall food quanlity the way it is."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had. How can a Chinese buffet in China town be so bad. Service food even deserts were awful. They use the cheapest meats and quality of everything else is just bad. Everything I tried I would take a bite or 2 and realize over cooked or undercooked.  Just waiting now for sickness."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to come and pig out with Chinese food. The variety is acceptable, the food is fresh and there is variety even if they could improve the menu a bit. The need to add more fresh fruit and more vegetable dishes. The dessert table is full of cheap cakes and jello. The waiters could also be a bit more attentive towards the customers. I ordered a beer and it was brought when I was finishing my meal"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the buffet but the take out dim sum place is alright : big portion for very cheap. Taste wise it's okay for the low prices, don't go there for the service. Definitely the cheapest I have found though, hence the decent rating."}
{"text":"The only reason it deserves 2 (I want to give 1.5) stars from me is because it's cheap for not-so-bad tasting variety of food. I don't mind the tom yum soup, the imperial rolls and sweet sour chicken and variety of noodles and I can say etcetera here since there are a lot of options to choose from!  It's not a place you come on a date but when you're kind of out of food at home and don't feel like going to a grocery store and cooking. They've even got pizza slices!  I usually go about it by taking a morsel-amount of things I like and trust enough to be made well and fill up easily along with tea/coffee/beverages(more like cool-aid with lots of water) and ice-cream!  The staff is very friendly and don't judge when you commit the crime of wasting huge portions of stuffs you wanted to try out but didn't end up liking it. I know many places charge for any wastage. But I guess they know they don't have a great tasting cuisine here so allow it since occasionally food might taste weird.   Tip: If in doubt about the quality, don't eat it. Better to waste than fall sick. Go for hot food that appear freshly made or freshly refilled. Smell before you put anything on the plate.  I keep coming here mainly because: It's cheap, close to where I live, good variety, easy to fill up on some favorites."}
{"text":"Big portions. Low prices. Low quality. Basically, quantity over quality.  The restaurant offers buffet or takeout. The buffet is relatively cheap, and the cheapness is reflected in the quality of the food. Likewise for the takeout, they give you huge portions for a low price at the expense of quality.  I recommend the takeout if you're looking for a quick and cheap eat, but I would keep my expectations low. I wouldn't recommend the buffet."}
{"text":"The price is right but the food is not. Oily, heavy, greasy, uninspired, inauthentic, and just downright gross."}
{"text":"This place has been around for YEARS !!!!!!    I remember coming here back in the 80s.   The food was better then, but there are still some dishes that are not bad.  I usually stick to the Authentic Chinese dishes, they are done better than the Americanized Chinese options.   I did not like their sushi, pizza, noodles, soups, etc.   But if you are looking to try some of their stewed meats, bbq dishes, dumplings, mussels and salt n pepper shrimp.   It is not bad.  The display is huge...they have salads, vegetarian dishes, noodles, rices, soups, pizza, sushi, desserts, ice cream, fruit, pudding, dim sum, bbq dishes, congee, seafood, wings, you name it......  As of early August 2016, the lunch price is CAD$ 11.85.  Not a bad deal !  Located right on the pedestrian area (Rue de la Gauchetiere)."}
{"text":"Really poor quality for a buffet, the food was cold and was left over from the lunch time special. Went to talk to the manager but they just yelled at us and cursed us in cantonese (funny because I actually understand every word they're saying). Even the waiters became very rude after and we also insulting us in front of our faces! Honestly, I know you don't go to a buffet for a 5 star meal, but at least serve something that's actually edible. Stay away from the buffet.  On the other hand their bakery is great, I've gone there to buy buns ever since I was a little kid and they're super cheap and filling. The service is really quick, but don't forget to ask them to make sure the steamed bao are actually hot! It's cash only for the bakery. I love their cha siu bao (baked), their ha gao, siu mai, almond cookies, and their dai bao! Their steamed bao are really big, and it used to be the snack I'd eat when I'd be on my way to work."}
{"text":"My companion and I were walking around Montreal hungry, broke, and tired.  We came across Chinatown with looking for some Thai food.  We stumbled across this Chinese buffet and got pulled in by our stomachs.  The buffet ($10) did what we wanted, fed us cheap and quickly.  There were a number of different tables both hot and cold.    I couldn't get into everything they had but here's my highlights: sushi (not fish, just a couple of veggie rolls), green beans, broccoli, cabbage, shumai, chocolate and strawberry ice cream, pad thai noodles, flat rice noodles, yams, honeydew melons,  and stickrice.  The place was busy and the food turnover was good.  I think I lucked out staying with veggies and noodles.  I could see getting sick from this place if you eat too much.  They also have a select-your-own-ingredient stirfry station.  We were in a hurry so we just ate and ran basically.  The service was very quick and responsive and the decor was dark and gloomy.  I accidentally put a chicken foot on my plate and I still have a little guilt for having it tossed out without attempting a single bite at it.  But I was a bit grossed out by it.  I'm going to take a few weeks away from eating chicken altogether.  Don't haunt my dreams angry chicken!"}
{"text":"Commentaire pour le comptoir take-out seulement!  Ça fait des années que je prends les take-out du jardin de Jade.  La qualité de nourriture est correcte: il manque un peu de saveur et les plats sont un peu huileux, mais je n'ai jamais trouvé une autre place qui a de meilleur rapport qualité-prix.  Le resto offre un menu d'une vingtaine de choix (du riz, des nouilles, des congees, etc.) à 4.35$+taxe; des \"bao\" sont du genre 1.85$ chaque. Des portions sont généreuses et le temps d'attente est à peu près 5min. Il y a aussi une terrasse sur la rue piétonnière la plus achalandée du quartier chinois :)  Donc: Qualité de nourriture: 3/5 Prix: 5/5 Portion: 5/5"}
{"text":"Buffets are buffets are buffets.    It's like a bad story retold for the nth time.  When you've had BAD chinese buffet, you've had this place.  Greasy noodles, coagulated beef and broccoli, browned and bruised \"fresh\" veggies...  Please steer clear!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Chinese tour and we were seated In the back. The aged food splatters on the wall would have been fine if this were a side street cafe in Hong Kong but it just seemed to give this place a dingy feel. The food had some good, some neutral, and some not good parts to it. Some of the meats were edible, but then again, I questioned what some of the meats were- they didn't taste like chicken, pork, or goat. I'd give this place 2 stars as the good, the bad, the average kind of cancel each other out, but the restaurant itself didn't win me in \"warmth\". Their Chinese desserts were fairly good, like the sticky rice cake and red bean soup. They have ice cream but I'd run away from that crystallized mash- it has nice flavor if you can crunch through the semi crystallized ice it has become. Not the worst buffet I've experienced but it comes rather close."}
{"text":"First off, let me qualify: I have never eaten at the Buffet. I have never stepped foot in the actual restaurant (door to the left). From what I gather from the reviews, the buffet restaurant has almost no connection to the take-out bakery even though they apparently share the same address. Where I usually go, is the bakery door (to the right) on the deck. It's no-frills in here - a lady behind a counter takes your take-out order and you go nuts. Unfortunately, they don't really have a menu, so you kind of have to ask a lot or know what to order. They have  --hands-down -- the BEST vegetarian steamed bao I've ever had. It is chock full of vermicelli, mushrooms, black fungus, carrots, peas - and very filling. A bun is the size of your entire hand and you will get full on a single bao. Also good is the pork cabbage bun and char siu BBQ pork bun. They also make \"Big Bao\" with a full boiled egg inside -- my dad is a big fan of these, and these buns are about the size of your head. Hugely filling. Other things to try: har gao (shrimp dumpling), fried meat 'salty water gok' dumpling, baked buns including BBQ pork, coconut, and dessert items like fried sesame balls, fermented white sugar cake, egg tarts, and more. A huge take-out order will set you back only $25, and I guarantee your family will be eating well for 3 or 4 meals."}
{"text":"There are two options for this restaurant listed on Yelp, and though I had already commented and rated this disgusting excuse of a restaurant, I will gladly warn others again here.  DO NOT COME HERE! This place is literally the worst \"restaurant\" I have ever been to in my entire life.   I'm usually a very polite person, and like to give people and restaurants honest and fair opinions. I'm also usually on the nicer side when rating a restaurant, but this \"restaurant\" has left such a horrible memory for me.   I had gone to Montreal's China town with some friends one evening, looking to eat some good Chinese food. Since we didn't feel as comfortable going to tiny authentic shops for some food, we decided to play it safe with a Chinese buffet. What could go wrong? We thought.   Everything went wrong.   The servers (especially the older Asian male waiter) were extremely rude. They gestured for us to go grab our food with a peeved off look when we were sitting at first, making ourselves comfortable. Okay, I would have let that slide if it wasn't for the crime scene being kept warm the under heat lamps.   The most unappetizing options of \"food\", and very minimal options too! The meat and vegetables all looked as if they were rotting, and the food all looked as if it was sitting out for days.   Don't get me started on the disgusting tastes. The food was covered in moldy sauces, they were very stale, overtly salted/sugary, and some of the meats squirted tons of oil once I bit into it. SUPER GROSS!  The dessert options all looked stale. We didn't bother with any of the pastries. We instead went for the vanilla ice cream which was so gritty in texture, and felt as if there was sand inside... I couldn't even let the ice cream pass at this restaurant.  This food should never be fed to anyone, not even to high risk offenders in prison. I'm not even exaggerating when I'm writing this! The food was THAT bad.  When my friend went to pay for the bill (I don't know why he even bothered to), the male waiter told us that my friend forgot the tip him, in a demanding way. WHAT TIP? WE PAID $15.00 EACH TO GET FOOD POISONING AND END UP LEAVING MORE HUNGRY THAN BEFORE.   Absolute horribly experience. I don't even know how they are still open. NEVER come here!!!"}
{"text":"Probablement le plus gros des buffets que j'ai eu la chance de voir et visiter en plein centre-ville. C'est bon mais ça ne bat pas Ka Lo Hin ! L'endroit est assez compact. C'est toujours très achalandé mais le service se fait très bien. Le choix des mets est énorme, c'est probablement la place la plus surprenante. Ça vaut la peine de prendre des photos.  Probably the largest buffet I've been to, downtown. It's good but it doesn't beat Ka Lo Hin ! The place is really tigh and regularly filled with clients. The service is fast enough, the choice in meal is surprinsingly high. It's worth pictures."}
{"text":"Bao!  There's the buffet in the back, but the store in the front is a dedicated bun aka \"bao\" pumping machine for to-go orders. You can smell the sweet fluffy bread from a block away. They have meat and veggie buns and of course the classic b.b.q. pork bun aka \"char siu bao.\" They aren't like the ones you get at dim sum. These bad boys are big, like Costco-big, like size of a baby's head-big. Eat a couple of these baos, and you're stuffed.  Tips: You gotta know what you want. It's crazy Canto style up in there. They also sell some dim sum."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Typical Asian restaurant. It's very large on the inside which is nice. I do find that it's a little bit run down and that the place could be fixed up a bit but that's just me.  FOOD: Food is average. Nothing special. However, I did really enjoy their steamed sticky rice (it's kind of hidden, you have to look into the rice cookers) and their fried battered fish. But I'm not surprised, it's a buffet and it's cheap so I don't expect top-notch quality. Their sushi is BAD, I would not recommend it. I don't recommend pizza, fries or desserts either (basically just don't eat the Western foods). But do try the meats, seafoods, noodles and stirfrys. It's what the Chinese do best. I'll definitely come back here again when I'm CRAVING cheap Chinese food or drunk.  PRICE: Prices are pretty affordable. They vary depending on which time of the day you're going at which is a plus to me. It's cheaper in the afternoon of course but even the dinner prices aren't bad.  SERVICE: Typical Asian restaurant service. They clear your plates and stand idly near the walls while you eat. Nothing special but again, it's a buffet so I know what to expect."}
{"text":"The best anything got here for me was vaguely acceptable, at a normal Chinese buffet I don't expect much but this place was still a disappointment, I couldn't even finish one plate of food, do yourself a favor and eat at one of the many other Chinese restaurants instead."}
