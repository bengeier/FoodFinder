{"text":"Very nice place. Great wines. Excellent service, knowlageble staff. Valet parking if u like. Superb food! Pricey but u deffinatly get what you paid for."}
{"text":"We had New Year's Eve dinner for 20 people at Coppi. The service here is amazing! We dealt with Alex, who did everything he could to make sure things were well organized and that all of our needs were accommodated. The food was incredible! I had the salmon and it was moist and delicious. Our friends all had good things to say about the meal as well. The atmosphere at Coppi is awesome too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't speak for others but my experience at Coppi has been exceptional.  The food was authentically Italian and you can tell they place a lot of pride in what they serve from the premium olive oil that's used for dipping into bread to the selection of Italian wines that they offer on the menu.  

I came with a big group for a friend's birthday and we were not disappointed with any of the dishes that were ordered.  The Calamari & Gamberoni alla Griglia was delicious, the grilled squid and shrimp was surprisingly tender.  The Risoo con Porcini was a mushroom risotto mixed in a big parmigiano reggiano cheese wheel and the flavour, texture and aroma that came out of that was incredible and mouth-watering.   The most interesting dish was by far the Pesce al Sale which is a choice of whole red snapper, orata or spigola and it's baked in sea salt to trap the moisture inside the fish and keeps it flavourful.  All and all, it was an impressive fare and we all ended the night blissfully full and happy.

Last but not least, service was impeccable, friendly and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Service was bad. Food was tasteless. Waitress was bad with attitude. Ended up spoke with the manager about it."}
{"text":"Coppi has been around in the neighbourhood for many years and has not had the following of some other restaurants but it has changed the decor recently and is casita but comfortable and not noisy."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of friends on a weeknight.  The place was not busy; we were the only guests in the entire restaurant for the first hour or so & we were there around dinner time (7pm).  Went here upon reading good reviews; however we were not impressed.  The food was ok;  price was expensive for the type of food that they offer.  We ordered sea brim fish baked in sea salt which was their special for the day & a bruschetta appetizer.  The rest of our party ordered pasta and/ or fish dishes.   Our server was annoying & kept  asking several times if we would like to order a bottle of wine, despite the fact that we made it very clear that we are not ordering any.  For the quality of food & service that they offer, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a late review, however This restaurant is absolutely fabulous. I planned and organized with the manager for a dinner of 18 people for New Year's Eve. I was going away over Christmas so I needed to take care of it before I went away the manager was amazing to work with and the meal was exquisite! There was more than enough food and we weren't charged the ridiculous prices that other restaurants try to get away with on New Years. Because we were a big group we had two tables at the back and the ambiance was great, they have unique lighting and art on the walls. At the end of the most amazing dinner, to top it all off my now finance proposed, and with the excitement the restaurant gave us all champagne for free to toast! This place will forever be in my heart and I hope to come back to celebrate our engagement every year! If I lived closer I would make it one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Coppi as ambience was so romantic. But truth of the matter is that this is just another average italian ristorante. Foods looked like they could be from upscale restaurant but they didnt taste like they were from upscale restaurant. Our pastas were a bit weird as they didn't taste like they had all the nice ingredients they were supposedly in the foods. Appetizers were good but they didn't need much cooking as they were just prociuttos and carpaccio."}
{"text":"Ate here on a recommendation from a friend. Turned out it was pretty good. A little \"spendy\" but the food was good and the atmosphere and service were great. A good wine selection and some delicious cocktails as well."}
{"text":"We were 8 people dining and the place was very pretty. The food was another issue. We ordered numerous bottles of wine and the appetizers were over priced, $15 for minestrone soup, $17 for ceaser salad is ridiculous. All the choices were overpriced.  That issue was not the real problem, the food came cold. The owner told us to be patient when we sat down which wasn't a problem since we were there for the evening.

 Veal chop, lamb rack, lamb shank, and 2 lamb pasta dishes came cold,not a hint of warmth. Other 3 people had fish which was good but vegetables were all cold. We sent back the rack of lamb, and the 2 pasta dishes and they seemed annoyed and not apologetic, LIKE IT WAS OUR FAULT. The cold veal chop was not sent back because it would have come overdone yet they didn't offer to make another. I suggested it but my husband left it and ate it cold. Other food  was returned with a hint of warmth and when asked for cheese on the pasta dish the owner came and gave me some and didn't even ask my friend eating the other dish. I called him over and he was annoyed and told her it wasn't necessary. Who says it's not needed if the customer wants it. Prices were high and service was slow. Cooking was not timed properly and restaurant had patrons but no lineup at the door to cause stress. They need a lot of fixing in their service and cooking. BTW, all desert was $13, everyone found steep for desert. This place needs help!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for winterlicious 2017.  The atmosphere was great and server was great.  The owner greeted us as we left the door.  Food wise, I had an arugula salad with fig which was very delicious.  Main course was the seafood soup (zuppa) that tasted really fresh and flavourful.  Dessert was tiramisu (very moist )that cannot be missed.  Great restaurant and I do recommend this."}
{"text":"this place been around for 25 years, and I can't believe I've only know about it now. Attracted by summerlicious, after looking around the restaurant to only realize most people come for the regular menu, for all the right reason.

They are generous with their portions and seasoning. Between the both of us, we would come back for all our appetizers, mains and desserts. I had the marinated seafood salad with chickpeas, and that would be belly happy for a small eater.

The lamb chop was done well. Very flavorful, with delicious long beans for sides. This dish is also on the regular menu.

The one that caught my eye on the regular menu is the Risotto for 2. They would Bring it over is a cheese wheel, to toss and coat in from of you prior to serving. Not sure how the tasting go, but it's definitely eye candy.  already planning a return trip for this dish."}
{"text":"We had not been back to Coppi in about ten years.  Last time there they just had an \"attitude.\"  Back then they served a dish that was advertised with pasta and substituted egg noodles.  It was weird, and they said they ran out of pasta, and ''sorry.\"

Now we returned.  It has been renovated.  Much more casual, no table cloths, but high prices.  

My wife is lactose intolerant.  The fish dish she wanted is served with mash potatoes, which of course are made with butter.  She asked if they could substitute pasta, and was told she could only have vegetables.  Pasta would be an extra charge.   They had roasted potatoes, which were roasted in butter.  They offered to steam some potatoes, but this would take time.  

Frustration set in on both sides, so rather then try to put together a meal and negotiate through what they might do, we decided to leave.

Most higher end restaurants realize they have more and more customers with lactose, gluten and other issues, and go out of their way to accommodate and look forward to developing a loyal clientele.  Not Coppi.

{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!  My boy and I just walked in (didn't get valet parking or anything), just wanting to try another place for a change-- lucky find!  If you like (somewhat pricey) Italian restaurants, this place is well worth the investment. And frankly it wasn't that pricey-- if you want the $500 wine you can have it here (not that we did-- haha!), but they also have great selections under $30 and by the glass or carafe-- no one looked down on us for getting a half litre of Cabernet (don't remember what it was-- waiter recommended), which was great!  Really, quite lovely!

EXCELLENT bread-- I asked about it (I have become a bit of a bread snob lately, since I've learned to make my own), and apparently it is from Rustic bakery-- they toast and add a high quality olive oil and rosemary-- some of the best I've had from a resto, honest!  The food was great (small portions, but which is fine for light eaters)-- we had the soup with a salad (for me), and the grouper fish-- very happy with this.  Very, very friendly service, absolutely no attitude.  We showed up really underdressed but felt right at home.  Before we left, we were given a fancily-wrapped Panatone (Christmas cake), treated like we were regulars, even though it was our first time.  

SO, I would have to say, all considered, this place is well worth a visit and I will certainly be back!

Cheers

{"text":"Dined here during Summerlicious 2016. Everything was delicious! The sea bream firsh - amazing, nice and flaky. The appetizers yummy, light and fresh. The tiramisu, as it should be, creamy, fluffy and sweet. The decor is romantic, dim lighting, but also modern. This was our first time here, but we would gladly come back again soon."}
{"text":"We used Open Table to book and it was seamless. Delighted to see valet parking on Yonge st as traffic was very heavy and parking would have been a challenge. Service was very attentive and food was good. Menu was a little limited. It would have been nice to have a few more pasta choices. Great atmosphere and tables were spaced to allow comfortable conversation. When we were finished our car was waiting out front for us with no waiting."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came here for Summerlicious. I came because I saw Grouper as one of the options on the menu. Upon arrival, they cannot find my reservations, but they sat us down. The fish option on the menu was halibut. I wasn't too pleased as I came for the Grouper. What they should have done is put daily fish on the menu because as a fish lover, each fish have different taste and texture. Anyways, not sure if I want to come back again."}
{"text":"First time here at the recommendation of a family friend. 

Italian beer on tap was solid

Appetizer: seasonal salad with sliced octopus, arugula, orange slices, and grapefruit slices ($15). Was pretty delicious. The fruit tasted great mixed with the octopus and greens. 

Main: house special of salt baked fish ($39). They had sea bream, sea bass, and red snapper. I had the red snapper. 

Basically the entire fish is encrusted in a THICK layer of salt and baked. The salt keeps all of the moisture inside while it cooks.

Once done, the dish is wheeled out to your table where the salt crust is chipped away, and the remaining salt brushed off the fish. Then it is skinned and de-boned. The fish filets are then presented on your plate. 

Fish was amazingly well cooked. I might have preferred a bit more seasoning, but the lemon infused olive oil they add is great.

Mains around $30-$45. Thought it was very fairly priced

I like the interior, decor, and vibe quite a bit. A nice place but not too fancy. Laid back with nice lighting and a good volume"}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Coppi once. An excellent high end menu with great wine selection. Some very unusual menu selections that are wonderful on special occasions if you want surprize. Great for the upper end crowd with valet parking, but I prefer the more local homy neighbourhood restaurants."}
{"text":"Tradition and Quality. My wife and I dined here with 5 of our friends. The owner, Alex, welcomed us like we were family. He took the time to provide recommendations and a thorough description into quality of their food.

This restaurant takes no shortcuts, everything from the quality of olive oil, to the explosiveness of the creamy decadent risotto, to the methods of freshness in their signature seafood dishes, are all effectively traditional and is evident with every bite.

Real foodies will understand and appreciate the quality of good service and food when they dine here. It is a lost art that Alex and his staff have not forgotten."}
{"text":"Just returned home from a terrible experience at Coppi.  From the moment we entered, service was terrible. There wasn't a host/ hostess and only other person in the room was a waiter, he did not even acknowledge us. We sat down at our table 20min after our reservation. Even worse, we did not get our menus until 20 min later. After waiting 30 min, our order was finally taken. Our waiter was unapologetic and rude about the wait. They did offer a small appetizer to make up for the wait. The food was cold and tasteless. The only thing I enjoyed was the wine. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"heard great things from a friend, so thought we had to try it, especially after hearing that they have fresh truffles flown in from Italy weekly! we had a great selection of appetizers, the carpaccio with truffle, amazing! burrata salad and calamari (so fresh)! we had the mushroom risotto in the cheese wheel, super tasty. tried a few of the truffle pastas and we were all very satisfied, not super heavy with the sauce but they were very generous with their truffle portion. definitely will be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"I don't know why Coppi has a 3 star review ??! They simply are 5 STARS!! We set up online reservations they call on the day of to reconfirm (which is great because its a reminder some people need). 

From what I understand Coppi has a background in cycling? It's quite evident in the decor and menu's. 

My boyfriend stayed with the regular menu because he didn't eat all day; I however stayed with the Summerlicious menu. 

For myself; I had the summerlicious 
- strawberry and arugula salad 
- monkfish on polenta w/ rapini
- tiramisu 

Lets just say I'll be for sure coming back to coppi for the regular menu. The salad was absolutely delicious burst of flavors and the pecorino cheese was just a nice touch! 

It was my first time having monkfish and I was so nervous but the server said its like the texture of lobster. Paired with the polenta and rapini; oh my goodness lets say I wish I didn't get the summerlicious portion. I kept wanting more!! 

The tiramisu was absolutely delightful. I ideally look for tiramisu's like this because its light and fluffy not overbearingly drenched with alcohol. 

My boyfriend had:
- octopus carpaccio- which he loved and said it complimented with the arugula and fresh peas
- oven baked orata- he was over the moon because its EXACTLY how his mother makes it which is a (Sardenian tradition) 

A bit pricy to say the least but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Service is obviously not one of their strengths. The older 2 waiters are such useless pylons.  They take your order and the minute you say no to wine, their faces turn into sour hags.  Not once did they come over to ask how my food was.  Nor did they offer another drink when I was out.  The younger bus boy/girl were working their asses off while these 2 old geezers stand around and do nothing.  We finished our meal and the plates sat there for 15 mins before they were taken away for our deserts.  Seriously..."}
{"text":"Sure wish there was a half star option as I would have given Coppi a 3.5.  The reason for the reduction in stars was honestly, because of the price.

We hadn't been to Coppi in quite a long time and it happened to be Winterlicious when we dined at Coppi a few days ago.  However, all four in our party ordered off the regular, a la carte menu.  The men had the soup of the day, the ladies each had a salad.  Our $43 entrees consisted of 2 spigele fish baked in salt and 2 orata fish baked in salt. (In case you didn't catch this, that was 4 x $43!!!!) We also order an extra order of potatoes and one glass of red wine along with one dessert and 4 coffees.

Don't get me wrong, the service was good and the food quite yummy but $400 with tax and tip???????????????  My $13 salad was (honest to goodness) made up of 10 mixed lettuce leaves and dressing.  Nothing further.  The side of $8 potatoes was (I truly counted) 8 very small wedges. The fish, after removing the salt and bones, very small but sufficient portions.

For $200 per couple, we could have eaten downtown where the ambiance was much nicer.  The last time we dined at Coppi, it was much classier and upscale.  Perhaps it would be best to keep the prices in line with the ambiance?"}
