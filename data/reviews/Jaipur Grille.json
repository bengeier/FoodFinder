{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with some friends for lunch. They were running \"Jaipurlicous\" so we had that.   I had the tandoori chicken wings as my app - didn't enjoy it all too much - it wasn't the traditional red, BBQ charred colour or taste I expected. Instead it was yellowish and looked to be semi broiled. Wasn't a fan.   My main dish of shrimp masala was good - really enjoyed the gravy - perfect level of spice and it was really aromatic. The naan was nice and fluffy.   For dessert I had the gulab jamun. The meal came with one, I could have easily had another 2 - these were rich, sweet and warm (I like them served warm, not cold like some restaurants do).   Price was great and service was good as well. Will come again and try other dishes, and I know not to order their tandoori wings."}
{"text":"I have been to many different Indian places in town, and this one ranks pretty high. Food is not too oily or greasy, and the naan is amazing.   The place is big and accomodates large groups."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in Mumbai and has been constantly disappointed at various Indian restaurants across North America, it was such a pleasant surprise to find Indian food here that was as nearly 100% as good as the food back home.  Our favourite things here are the Samosas, the Lamb chops, the okra and the eggplant. I generally don't eat meat, but the Lamb chops here are just irresistible.  The service is excellent.  It is a little pricey, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Friendly, efficient service.  Simple decor and delicious food....as others have said, not greasy which can often be the downfall of Indian food.  The Bhindi Rajasthani (fried okra) is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I had a surprisingly poor meal here just after Christmas, 2013.  I ordered vegetable curry as my main course. The vegetables were soggy & pedestrian, & seemed to have come out of a package, frozen. The sauce was generic, as though supermarket curry powder had simply been stirred into tomato sauce.  The samosas were OK, but not very flavourful.  I wondered if the ownership &/or chef had changed since the last time I had eaten here, several years ago, when the food had been first-rate."}
{"text":"I eat Indian food not infrequently. For me it is essential that the restaurant listen when you place an order, especially when it is regarding the degree of heat/ spice in the food. When we placed our order over the phone we specifically said, \"Please make it very very very mild\". We picked up the food and took it home for a birthday celebration. It was a large amount of food. The food was so hot we could barely eat it.  While I could appreciate that the flavours were very good, what's the point if the heat prevents you from enjoying the food?"}
{"text":"Great food, with great flavours. Unique dishes beyond the standard butter chicken variety you get at other indian restaurants. Only bad thing I can say is the prices are high but the decor is tasteful and atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"This is a quality Indian restaurant that's not to be missed if you live in its neighbourhood. The food is probably the most delicious I've had in recent memory in this category. However, the prices are steep, given the location.  The first time I went here was in the winter of 2010 and my family ordered some great vegetarian and meat based appetizers and dishes. The staff were a bit quirky, with the waiter being very upfront with suggestions and assumptions as to what we'd like or dislike. I had half a mind to tell him to cool it, but my family was in a good mood and didn't mind the interaction. All in all, the food was excellent and the experience left a lasting impression.  Just last night, I ordered delivery from their location. I'm slightly outside of their core delivery zone, so they charged $8 for delivery, and the total bill was just shy of $50 for the following: 1. Lentil soup (delicious) 2. Butter chicken (amazingly creamy but mediocre on the spicing of the chicken, making it taste as if it was just boiled with little regard to the final product) 3. Baingan Kashmiri (tasty and spicy) 4. Regular naan (soft and chewey) 5. Garlic naan (delicious but a bit tame on the garlic side)  The food arrived hot and fresh, but I can't say I felt the value was there. That's the only reason this place gets 4* instead of 5*."}
{"text":"This place is run by an extremely dishonest and untrustworthy person. Having heard good reviews of the food, I ordered chicken and shrimp biryani for 40 people. The manager had given me an estimate of $203 including tax for this including delivery. Come D-day, when I asked for a confirmation of the price, he tried to fool me by adding additional tax and delivery charges. The WORST part is that the biryani was just colored rice, and the chicken and shrimp biryani barely had any of those. The entire party was disappointed with the food and I am skeptical of ever going back. If this is what they do, I wonder what other unethical things they do with food. Recycle half eaten dishes?"}
{"text":"Came back here a few times after the initial visit and the bar was set lower, which is disappointing.   My hubby and I came here on weekday evenings and noticed the service suffered a bit even though we were the only people there. Also, the food portions decreased and prices have gone up. Prices on some of the desserts have decreased by $1 or so, but still expensive for the amount.   The food portions need to be a bit more for the price, and the dishes can use more spiciness. I noticed that the dishes are usually overdone on one particular spice which overwhelms the overall taste.  Love the amazing cassata ice cream. It's really good!  Not too sure about this place anymore, but I may return just to give it another chance."}
{"text":"4/5! Fantastic Indian food. I highly recommend this place. Great service, reasonably priced and authentic food (not too oily). For starters, the Tandoori Mushrooms are a must have! The hara kebabs and chicken tikka are also good starters. The portions are fairly large. For mains, all of them were great, but my favourites were daal panchtaran, goan shrimps and paneer Makhani. the only dish I did not like was the chicken pahadi (nothing special). Overall, we enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I generally really don't like most indian food. I find it super greasy, way too heavy on the sauce, the pakoras are normally done wrong and all the veg dishes have paneer or ghee, making it super hard as a vegan.  The food at Jaipur Grille, however, was really good. The pappadums were spicy (as they should be). They had a good number of vegan dishes, though I get the feeling that they didn't know what vegan was, so I\"m not 110% positive there wasn't some ghee in there... Three of us split an order of pakora (not the best I've had, but quite nice), an eggplant medallion dish in sweet tomato sauce, mixed veggies and cashews in a green sauce, and a spicy yellow lentil dish with rice. The food was great, tons of flavour, not greasy. Our other friend got an okra dish, which was really good, though a bit on the salty side.  Service was amazing. They were very attentive and friendly.  Decor was beautiful and the lighting was perfect.  Some things that could be better... I do really hate that they only have white rice. Come on, get with it! If you don't want to do brown rice, offer wild rice or something!  For some reason they gave us all our leftovers wrapped in one bag. Very weird, like we obv don't all live together. I think that they could have asked if they were unsure. And worst, as Emily M. said, they mixed the leftovers together, meaning she got meat in her veg dish! Not cool!   I'm still not super into indian food, but the next time I am in the mood for some, I'll check out Jaipur again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch - don't be fooled if there aren't many people there - the food is very good, and reasonably priced. Had the chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer - both very tasty. The business lunch is very filling, good if you're hungry or for leftovers."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple.  I enjoy coming here for lunch or dinner.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The food is delicious.  One of the best Indian restaurants around.  The prices are very reasonable as well.    The kebab platter is always appetizing.  The combination of spices used really wake up the palate.  The chefs really know what they're doing.   Great location and ambiance.  Nothing pretentious about it.  Simple, clean decor.  The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some exquisite chicken curries. Korma and vindaloo curries are one of the best you can get.  Also, in terms of freshly baked Indian breads, this is a number one restaurant. They have the best garlic naan I have ever eaten.  That being said, I am very disappointed with their vegetarian dishes. Cauliflower and potato curry has no sauce whatsoever, was excessively salty and the vegetables felt as if they were made of gum. I guess they did not use fresh vegetables. So it is definitely not a good place for vegetarians to go, and sadly so, as I think vegetarianism is a very important element of the Indian cuisine.  One of the waiters is very intimidating. He never smiles and it feels like he is angry with you.   The atmosphere is not very relaxed. I would not go there alone. However it might be perfect for formal occasions."}
{"text":"GREAT INDIAN FOOD  i had a greay deal about this restaurant and have been wanting to check it out for a while - and we finally did.  The food was delicious, the ambience is nice and the staff was friendly as well.  Food: (a) Appetizers: - we had the dahi vaada and chaat for starters - was good but a little disapointing - i was hoping for more chaat style - the combination of the two dishes in one was a little weird. Both dahi vaada or chaat would've tasted better as separate dishes - kebab platter  - the chicken tikkas were so tender and delicious! The fish was fantastic as well. Would've been satisfied with anothe round of the platter  (b) Entrees - daal panchtaran - a mix of 5 yellow and orange daals - ti was good but not my favourite entree that we tried. - Chicken Tikka masala was very flavourful!  - Diawli Special - the lamb dish was AMAZING!! THE best Indian lamb dishes i have EVER had. I wish this was on their regular dinner menu  (c) Dessert -Kulfi - tasted great and the presentation was fantastic!!  Highly recommend this place for good indian food!"}
{"text":"Wow - just wow. I always run by this place and have been meaning to go to Jaipur for the longest time. I am a pretty picky eater but was not disappointed at all as I really enjoyed the food.   My husband and I had the business lunch deal with the appetizer and desserts and we left super-full and happy. I had the samosa, the saag chicken, and the mango mousse. The samosa was very flavourful although a tad salty. But it was not so greasy like the majority of samosas I've encountered. The saag chicken was really good too, and it came with a big tasty piece of naan and curried vegetables. The plate comes with rice too, but I asked for it to be omitted. The mango mousse was a little too sweet for my liking, but was good nonetheless.  In terms of service, the waiter was attentive and polite, and he was always quick to check if we had enough water. I'd really give them 4.5 stars, but the system doesn't allow that option. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"One of the nicer Indian restaurants in the area. Been there a couple of times now. The inside of the restaurant is neat, clean and well spaced so tables, chairs and people do not seem cramped. We were seated  immediately and food was served soon after we ordered. DIdnt have to wait long. Things I liked about the food were that the presentation was  neat, food was served hot, and the taste was quilte pleasant if a little on the mild side. The seesh kebab was spicy and very well made, We ordered the daal (yellow lentils) and I felt on that one curry dish that we had the quantity could have been better.  I enjoyed the evening here. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to have a tasty dinner in a very pleasant setting, then this is it!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in North America. After moving to New York from India 4 years back, I have been craving for authentic Indian food ever since. I stumbled upon Jaipur Grille on my last visit to Toronto. And it was just perfect. Great food, great atmosphere and excellent service. Do not miss their Chicken Tikka Masala (for meat eaters), Subzi Malai Methi (vegetarian) and Mango Mousse."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken biryani and dahi vada and chaat. I was surprised that I got biryani instead of the chicken tikka masala I thought I had ordered - not sure if it was an error on the Just Eat website or if I clicked on it myself. Anyway, I love biryani and was excited to eat it.   The biryani was not very good at all. I took out a plate of food and then had to go back to the kitchen because there wasn't any chicken in it...I actually had to stir the food around to hunt for meat. There were a few chunks of chicken in there but definitely not enough compared to the amount of rice. The rice itself was spicy but otherwise lacked flavour, same with the chicken which was a little dry.   The dahi vada chaat (new to me) was interesting, slightly sweet and cake-like in a thick creamy sauce. I liked it better than the biryani but it was nothing special and I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"An overall disappointing experience started when I walked in the door and waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged my presence. When a server did appear, she just suggested to me and another person waiting that we just take a seat - but did not ask any questions to determine what we were waiting for. After getting seated, we had to call a server over to take our order after several minutes. Then we had to wait quite a while to get the first drink my friend ordered. After about 20 minutes, I was informed that they were out of Kingfisher beer, and suggested I order something else.   When the food arrived, the experienced sadly did not improve. Everything was oversalted and tasted much the same. We ordered chicken saag, goan shrimp, aloo gobi, rice and naan. The shrimp was stringy. The meal was supposed to include raita, but we were informed they had run out. We barely touched the food as it just wasn't very good. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Very nice Indian food. (Disclosure: I've never been in India but ate there with people who had been). Everything seemed freshly made and the spices were varied among the dishes, also not too hot for my taste. Elegantly simple decor makes the dining room very pleasant. Service was attentive but not excessively so."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality, great service and reasonably priced. I am a regular there and would recommend it to anyone. I have only ever ordered take-out, however, so I can't attest to their table service."}
{"text":"I have found the best Naan in town people!  I love the naan made in Delhi and made my peace with the fact that I could never find it here, until... I found Jaipur Grille!  The naan here is so good and I've tried it along with the Butter Chicken which is good, the Palak Paneer which is amazing and a Lamb dish whose name I'm forgetting. But trust me, this is one of the better Indian Restaurants and I find myself hardly disappointed with the choices. They also have the best Mango Lassi in town ;)  The service is great and the staff goes out of their way even if you order take out. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian appetizer platter ($9.95) was soggy and generally too salty.  Chicken vindaloo ($14.95) was flavourful and moderately spicy.  Lamb rogan josh ($15.95) had more subtle flavour.  Garlic naan ($2.95) was fresh.  Serving staff was polite and efficient.  The portion size was small considering the price.  All in all, it was a good experience and I would try again when I'm in the mood for indian food."}
{"text":"Great items on the menu everything is absolutely delicious. The dinner menu to order individual dishes can be pricey but the lunch special during the weekdays is one of the best deals I've seen for Indian yet! The ambiance is a bit more upscale then most Indian places which is good for date nights! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times, and I'm not impressed. The food is overpriced, isn't that great, and the portions tend to be quite small for the meat dishes. For example the chicken korma is $15, and is about the size of an appetizer. I had the paneer makhani, which is a vegetarian dish, and the portion was more generous than the meat dishes. However, although the paneer itself was good, the sauce tasted sort of like canned tomato soup with some Indian spices.  The only good I can really say about Jaipur Grille is that the naan is tasty, and that the restaurant is physically very nice. The staff is also nice, although service can sometimes be slow."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, including a New Year's Eve Dinner and the food has always been good. I'm not sure about it being strictly authentic Indian, but the service has always been polite and efficient. They like to push the drinks, too-- which is something I normally like, but with Indian food, I find it's hard to pair anything properly with the exception of a cold beer. Since I'm not a beer drinker, I usually opt for water.  There definitely seems to be more of a North American slant to the cuisine here, I brought my parents here for lunch one day and my father, who can't handle any spice, was a bit overwhelmed, but he liked it. I'm not sure my mother enjoyed the car ride home with him :P  They do a good job, but frankly, I feel that they are a bit on the expensive side and trying to dress up their food with fancy cocktails. But decent enough."}
{"text":"Seeing previous reviews here on Yelp, I have decided to give this place a try for dinner.  I was really happy that I did - the food was Fantastic, our server was very attentive and accommodating. The atmosphere was great as well.  This was my first time trying Indian food so I sampled several dishes... and every single one was incredible. Woke up in the morning craving some freshly baked naan and lamb... Between the two of us we spent 60$ with appetizers, mains and a shared dessert."}
{"text":"We got the food delivered for dinner and it turned out to be the horrible experience. The worst veg. biryani and paneer makhani i have ever had in my life. the vegetables in the biryani tasted so bad and the rice was also not perfect.  Never ever ever in my life."}
{"text":"i was really delighted how tasty the food is.  the chole dal is done just right.  the curry chicken could be spicier but still well rounded flavor.  the rice is really decently cooked.  good solid indian food (which says a lot for the toronto indian establishments that i've tried) but they could beef up the taste a notch for what they are charging."}
{"text":"This place is an office favourite.  The food and service are always great.  I can't think of anything on the menu that I didn't like.  Great place for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but consistently delicious!!! Service is always attentive, definitely a nice place to have a nice relaxed and yummy dinner!"}
{"text":"We used to get take-out from here on a regular basis ages ago, but after a change in management (over a year ago? Maybe longer...) we just didn't feel the JG love. We tried other places but mostly just went without Indian food. We tried The Yellow Chilli a few weeks back, thinking this new place in the Yonge/Eg neighbourhood would fill the void. Not even close! So tonight, we ordered takeout from Jaipur Grill and we couldn't be happier!! It is delicious and fresh and yay! We will definitely go back. Of course, the butter chicken is a must - excellent!The naan was fresh and light and the pullau rice was good. Papadums were good and overall, we are very pleased with JG and thank you for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"We got the dinner for 3 platter with an additional entree for a party of 4.  There was more than enough food to share between all of us.  I enjoyed the flavours of this meal much more than the standard Indian buffet style.  Service was quick and attentive.  The seekh kabob and veg pakoras appetizers were made to order and fresh.  The seekh kabobs were full of flavour and the the veg pakoras were crispy with a delightful spicy mint sauce to complement it.  I enjoyed the lamb korma and chicken makhani entrees.  Both had lots of flavour and the right amount of spices but was creamy and sweet.  The beef vindaloo had quite the spicy kick to it and the beef was soft and tender.  The grouper needed a bit more seasoning but it was still good."}
{"text":"Stopped by Jaipur Grille for Summerlicious '14 - their menu was inexpensive for a 3-course Indian lunch. My selections were as follows:  App: Onion Bhajias Entree: Lamb Rogan Josh Dessert: Gulab Jamun  Each course was very well made. The onion bhajias were very crispy and were accompanied by a mild sauce. The lamb rogan josh came with garlic naan, freshly baked. The gulab jamun was also delicious, and my friend described it as a fried cinnamon timbit covered in syrup. Mmm.   Service was unobjectionable, and the restaurant ambience was decent.   4 stars given solely for doing nothing wrong. Well done."}
{"text":"We routinely get Jaipur Grille for takeout.   It is Classic Indian food done well.  There isn't anything super creative on the menu but all the classics are very well executed and when your in the mood for that this place cannot be beat  We will eventually make our way over and try the lunch buffet.    The naan bread is out of this world."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight -- was craving some spices and quite enjoyed everything I ordered.  The food for 2 can feed 4 for $55 plus taxes and tip, so I'd start with that when ordering delivery or take-out.  We had the lentil soup -- very bright flavors, with a lemony tang and poppy seeds(?!?!); aloo gobi -- very mushy cauliflower was not a hit with my cauliflower loving kid, unfortunately; butter chicken -- great curry flavor that was a bit sweet, lamb saag -- fairly tender lamb meat, but I still got out a knife to cut it; raita and of course, the basmati was fine and the naan bread was fresh.  Everything came hot and piping within 40 minutes of ordering and I appreciated that tremendously.  Overall, if I need another Indian food fix, I'd order again from here.  Whenever I eat Indian food from Queen Street, I feel like my pores are saturated with all the greasiness or richness of all the flavors.  Jaipur Grille is definitely no Queen Street."}
{"text":"That's some tasty Indian right there.  Chicken tikka masala (like butter chicken but with some heat and sweet peppers), mutter paneer (cheese chunks with peas in tomato/onion sauce) and daal panchratan (soft yellow lentils spiced with tumeric).....all good baby.  The naan here is also exceptional...it's got just the right amount of chew. You could say it's...\"second to naan\"...  K thanks bye :)"}
{"text":"My family hosted a party here for about 25 guests in the back room.  We looked at about eight places all over the GTA before choosing Jaipur Grille.  It was more expensive for a group meal than most of the other places we saw, but the space and layout was perfect for us so we went with it.  Turned out the price was totally worth it -- most of our guests (who were South Asian) were blown away by how good the food was!  Most impressively, Jaipur Grille manages to make yummy Indian food without the usual \"secret ingredient\": copious amounts of oil and grease.  For anyone else doing a large group event, we were very happy with the well-coordinated service and nice ambiance (and no surprise charges at the end of the night -- whew!).  I've gone back here since the party and the food has been consistently good (and pretty affordable too).  My faves: the samosa chaat (an appetizer) and the mango mousse."}
{"text":"Been going to Jaipur for 15 years and the food is always great. Tonight's visit was no exception. However the service has changed.... dramatically. Gone are the familiar servers only to be replace by some   younger and clearly less experienced individuals. These new servers felt awkward....albeit pleasant. The biggest surprise of the night came when they changed into their street clothes before we had finished the meal and proceeded to clear the table. Overall, the experience of eating at Jaipur felt inferior this evening....however the food quality remains high."}
{"text":"Compared to most Indian restaurants I have tried in Toronto, this one is top of the list.  My favorite dishes so far have been the chicken tikka and the saag paneer ( spinach and soft cheese). The flavors of the spinach were well developed and complex.  The kebabs, however, were dry on more than one occasion.  I would go back just for the dishes mentioned above!"}
{"text":"After ordering Jaipur Grille several times and enjoying it, we decided to finally check out the place in-person during Summerlicious.  The place was almost empty when we arrived on a Friday night, and we were quickly shown to a nice table by the window. Shortly after placing our order, however, a party of three and a baby were seated at the table right next to ours -- despite the fact that there were many, many other empty tables in the joint.  Now, here's what I've struggled with. Do I make this review all about our experience next to this table of inconsiderate diners? Or do I focus on the food alone? I've decided to go with the former, since the staff felt it was okay to place a small infant at a table *right next to another one* despite ample space in the restaurant.  My appetizer, the Chicken Ginger Tikka (Chicken breast marinated in lemon juice, crushed ginger & garlic, cooked over charcoal), was actually pretty good and I did enjoy it quite a bit. It was only after I'd finished eating it that the aforementioned baby really started to express its displeasure at being out of the house.  The baby wailed for a solid half hour (and probably kept going long after we'd left). Nobody at the table made any effort to shut the baby up, and in fact, they all just started talking louder. The staff not only didn't do anything about this, but basically ignored our table for the rest of our meal. I would've ordered another alcoholic beverage, but nobody asked if I wanted one. Worse still, our water stayed empty right up until it was time to pay the bill.  My main was the Shrimp Masala (Tiger shrimp sautéed with peppers & garlic in tomato & onion masala) and my dessert was the Gulab Jamun (Dumplings cooked in light syrup with saffron & pistachios), but because of the absolutely intolerable ambiance, I was forced to wolf them down in an attempt to get the hell out of there. (I should note, however, that the shrimps were not peeled. The laziness of the chef meant that I was forced to spend a few minutes attempting to peel each of the four or five shrimps, with the endeavor made all-the-more difficult by the sauce that they were soaked in.)  All in all, this was one of the worst, most annoying meals I've had in a very, very long time. Neither of us enjoyed our meals, since we raced through the entree and dessert portions. The fact that we paid about $100 for such an experience is something I won't forget for a long, long time."}
{"text":"The foods are delicious but what I like even more is the friendliness of the staff. I have come in here with friends for lunch and have also ordered delivery and the staff are always accommodating and full of smiles. Sometimes, in a busy city like Toronto, some people forget how to be nice to other humans so it's always refreshing when this is the case. At Jaipur, you get good food, great atmosphere and friendly staff. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"My old co-worker and I were wondering around his neighbourhood looking for a place to have dinner.  He told me that there was an Indian restaurant not too far that we can go to.  Famished I said, \"Sure\"!  Jaipur Grille is located right beside the St. Louis Bar on the corner.  Walking into the restaurant, I had a whiff of bathroom cleaner smell which I thought was odd, but I pressed on.  The host/waiter greeted us and guided us to our seats.  It was not busy at all which was nice and intimate.  We decided to order a whole slew of stuff, with some recommendation from the waiter: Beef Rogan Josh, Chicken Biryani, Vegetable Platter, and Garlic Naan.  I also explained to him that I had a nut and shellfish allergy which he acknowledged.  The veggie platter came out first and it was decent.  The Onion Bhajis were excellent, tasty, crispy and looked like a bunch of fingers!  The samosas were okay but tasted like store bought frozen.    Our main entrées took a bit of time which I was okay with because I assumed they were putting all the fixings to it.  When it did come out, the presentation was superb.  Pictures I took, yes!  Spooned the Biryani to my plate, I noticed a hard looking \"chicken\" piece.  I touched it and poked it with my finger.  It was totally hard.  I picked it up and smelled it.  It was a CASHEW NUT!  I called another waiter over and I know it was not his fault but I told him that I was allergic to nuts and I had told that the other waiter acknowledged it.  He apologized and took my plate away which had a garlic naan and some beef too.  Our waiter came to our table afterwards and apologized for making the error.  I let him know of the dangers of it and how I specifically told him about it.  There were no language barriers here either.  He should not have forgotten!  They gave extra naan, I guess on the house for making the error.  However, they did not replenish the beef.  In the meantime, I chowed down on some Beef Rogan Josh and naan which was alright, not stellar but good enough.  The corrected Biryani was served and I got to eating it.  It was pretty bad.  There was not really any flavour to it and the chicken breast pieces were totally bland and dry.  It as kinda sandy!  Not impressed.  Blah!  Although they apologized for the error, the food did not make it a cut above other places.  The bhajis, beef and naan were good but the biryani and making that error to my allergy was at a complete disappointment.  I do not think I would return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch.  It is great if you work in the area and need a nice but not expensive place to bring a co-worker or client.  For that matter, I sometimes will go alone for a lunch treat, as it's never full and I am always in-and-out of there in 45 minutes or so.  They have an outdoor patio (on the street) which is nice on warm days.  The lunch items range from $8 to $11 (plus tax and tip) and are served with your choice of rice or naan bread.  I usually get the Saag Lamb, which is lamb masala cooked with baby spinach, and the naan. The lamb is very tasty, with just enough spiciness for me (for those with \"spicier appetites\", I've heard the vindaloo is great) and the bread is soft and delicious.  They obviously have a dinner menu but I haven't tried it.  They also have a weekend brunch (weekends 11:00 AM - 2:30 PM)with a somewhat odd mix of Indian dishes and items like \"grilled chicken and cheese sandwich\" (all under $10)."}
{"text":"This place has great value and really well done Indian food. They really care about what they are making. I also really like that for dinner they have the option to do dinner for 2, 3 or more people which means you choose an app, a vegetarian main option and 2 meats for a flat rate and that also includes naan,  rice and deserts. Perfect!"}
{"text":"The soup's on! The lentil soup at this place is killer. It has this tang to it that I love. I once tried to cajole the server into telling me what they put in it, and he said he would ask the chef, but he flaked on me. Anyway, I eventually de-constructed it.   All the food I've tried here is high quality. Tandoori was nice as well as the curry dishes. Staff is generally quite cordial and friendly and its never hard to get a table."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for someplace classy to have our first anniversary dinner, and I'd been meaning to try Jaipur for a while. If you email for a reservation, note that while the website says reservations are not final until you receive a confirmation, they said on the phone that they only reply to email reservations if the time requested isn't available.   The atmosphere is tranquil and relaxing. There's no noisy decor, just a couple of pieces of abstract art in an elegant cool-coloured room, and the music is cheerful sitar at a low and non-distracting volume. Sit by the big front window for Yonge Street peoplewatching. The only minus is that while there are ramps on the main floor, the washrooms are down a set of stairs, so it's not truly accessible.  The food is really, really tasty. We got the dinner for two ($49.95), which includes a shared appetizer, three shared entrees with rice, naan, and raita, and a shared dessert. (Note that sharing dessert is great if you're a couple, but otherwise you may want to order your own and avoid the shared menu.)  Our appetizer was dahi vada & chaat, which was a little plate of sensory overload -- sour yogurt, soft beans, sweet mint, and crunchy lentil crisps. We finished off the sauce with a spoon, it was that good. It seemed pretty small for two people, but we didn't anticipate how much more food we were getting.  Two of the three entrees in the dinner for two can be meat/seafood; we got shrimp masala, paneer makhani, and bhindi Rajasthani. The former two were tasty; the bhindi was a big plate of slivered and deep-fried okra with mint chutney for dipping. This is apparently a house original and is really fantastic and (I can't believe I'm using this word) more-ish.  Dessert was two big fat warm gulab jamun in syrup with lots of pistachios.   Drinks were not included in this deal but are not to be missed. There's an extensive wine list and what seem to be house cocktails. Hubby got an Indian Summer (Bombay Sapphire gin in lime soda with mint) and I got a Ginger Mojito (pineapple juice and ginger beer with rum, plus mint and ginger strips). Whenever it says 'mint' you're getting a huge handful of fresh mint leaves in the top of the glass.  I've been home for three hours, my tummy is still full, and yet I'm planning my next visit. :)"}
{"text":"Food:  Zero Stars (2 tiny pieces of chicken and even smaller potato that could fit into palm of hand!!!!) Service:  Zero Stars  Paid $13 for lunch special:  vindaloo chicken [chicken should be more than 2 pieces of cut up chicken (each smaller than a timbit) and 1 potato (size of 2 thumbnails) inside small soup container with mostly liquid watery gravy - flavour wasn't even absorbed], biryani (big rectangular container maybe 1.5 small bowls) and naan (partially dried), tiny salad (tiny container for sauces).  The chicken container lid melted off, so I lost gravy-liquid, BUT there were only 2 pieces of chicken and 1 piece of potato that could fit into the tiny salad container for \"sauces\" meaning \"sauce size\".  If I can figure out how to attach a pic I will of the containers, but I was so hungry I didn't think of taking pics of the food!  The server was utterly rude with crossed arms asked why I didn't call first and I told him that I tried, but nobody answered and then he called out to a guy to investigate the phone issue with me instead of just tactfully handling my food order.  I told server that if it was trouble I didn't need to order lunch (I was the only customer).  When the food was ready, the loser server shouted to me to get the food (he didn't even bother to walk the food over to me from around the wall/dining area and I was sitting on a chair by the entrance), I asked for the nice guy that he asked to look into the phone earlier, and the server pretended he didn't know which guy I was talking about when the entire time there was \"only one guy\" and there was nobody else and no other customers the entire time.  I decided to tell the arrogant service why he was a jerk and he apologized only because I think he thought he'd get into trouble, but sadly I didn't know how bad the meal was going to be or I would have demanded a refund and marched right out.  I will not return.  If it's called carbs (rice and naan) than sure, be honest and rename it carbs and price it accordingly and do not call it chicken when there's barely chicken let a lone not even vindaloo.  I always go to Banjara on Eglinton for spectacular vindaloo chicken.  They can alter the salt and spice level and you do see actual chicken pieces.  They don't even expect you to call although they have tons of takeout orders and I have never been greeted with cross arms."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch a few days ago. I went for the Business Lunch Menu.  I'm sure this place makes more money at night because when I walk by this place everyday at lunch it seems dead or there are not a lot of people swinging by.  I have to say though the lunch menu is decent and affordable.  I had the chicken Tika Masala.  It came with a small soft drink, naan, rice, veggies and the main dish.  A LOT of food and all for $8.75+ tip.   Staff and friendly and the service is quick - which is always nice because sometimes you don't have a long lunch hour.  Mine is usually 1 hour and that is enough for me not to be rushed.  I would defintetely come back and try their other dishes.  For an Indian restaurant and would put it up there with Kama Sutra on Bayview.   Jaipur Grill is usually part of Summerlicious/ Winterlicious as well.   Would be nice if there were more customers though -  I kind of find is weird when you're the only one in the restaurant - seems they are always watching you."}
{"text":"The kebabs taste great.  They have a buffet lunch on Wednesdays with a decent selection of foods, all of which was hot and just as good as their normal lunch fare with lots of meat. The buffet's mango mousse is ice cream frozen into a bowl.  Despite the clean appearance of the customer area of the restaurant, apparently they don't have very good results from Toronto health inspections which makes me wary of returning.  WiFi password is 4163225678. Parking is easy to find on nearby Duplex Ave, or paid street parking on Yonge St."}
{"text":"We came to Jaipur grill today on a whom since we seen it across the street from St. Louis. There were many well dressed individuals here and the place was quite upscale. The service was excellent and the owner himself even came out and introduced himself!  I'm not that familiar with Indian food but they recommended me a couple dishes that turned out excellent.  I can recommend the grouper konkani and shrimp massala. The portions looked big but when I was done I was craving more so we opted for desert as well. The experience was very authentic and I can't wait to come back.  The owner told me they've been around for 14 years and have a second location somewhere around waterfront?? I can't remember..   Anyways, check this place out..it looks like a great place for after work."}
{"text":"I was actually looking forward to writing a good review for this place.   The food was quite good and a step up from lot of other Indian places I've been to.   I went out with a group of friends (1/2 vegan 1/2 meat eaters). We were very clear about this when ordering.  After were we done we asked for our left overs to be packed up.  I just went to eat the left overs only to find a HUGE piece of meat - beef, lamb? its brown..and some other meat rice dish mixed into my veg left overs. This over-site is really unfortunate. I called to complain and the apology seemed very insincere.  First I had to explain to a server the problem and he just totally didn't understand, then I was passed off to the manager. As a vegetarian it really is upsetting to have meat mixed into your food. I don't think this place understands this. The manager was just giving me some excuse that when its a large table they always put all the left overs together.    Our main server was very attentive and nice, but the server that packed up our food was obviously clueless. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"5 stars for service 3 stars for food  I'd heard good things about Jaipur Grille so I made reservations for Winterlicious and dragged family and friends to try it out.  The interior: Thankfully doesn't reek like Banjara et al. It's polished but forgetfully bland. Soothing ambiance. We were the first ones there that afternoon, and it didn't get busy for Saturday lunch.  The service: Very attentive (just saw one waiter), friendly and accommodating. We walked in at 1pm  and were there till 4 pm!  The food: Was a tad disappointing. Mint chutney lacked mintiness. The dahi bhalla chaat (rice crisps in yogurt with sweet and tangy sauces) lacked sweet chutney. The tandoori wings (really looked forward to these) smelled like fowl. Not good.  The rogan josh was ok. Not terrible but nothing too praiseworthy either since it lacked fennel. The saag paneer lacked garlic and punch. It was ok.  The fish curry that I had was delicious: lightly sweet because of the onion puree and coconut and not because of artificial sweetener. The vegetable biryani won high praises from its consumer. The naan was really fresh. The mango mousse was quite good, not too sweet but still mangoey. The gulab jamuns also won praise from their consumer, but that consumer has 32 sweet teeth so it's no tall order!  My taste buds weren't too impressed. It's a one time deal for now."}
{"text":"This place makes my favourite saag paneer in the city. Really nice and creamy, lots of flavour, the paneer is a perfect meaty texture without being too hard or crumbly. The paneer makhani is also nice, and they do a great lamb rogan josh.  I've never dined in here, but do take out with them a fair bit. Portions are pretty good for the price, especially if you're getting vegetarian places ($9.50 for a saag paneer and I get 2-3 meals out of it easily).  Most of their curries are gluten free. I have (actual real) celiac and eat here fairly regularly. Just avoid fried stuff and obviously-gluteney things, of course!  Some of the staff can be a bit snarky when taking phone orders, but I don't really care."}
{"text":"Jaipur Grille is a great Indian restaurant with higher than average prices. Their grouper konkani is a reason in itself to pay a visit. It's soft and tender, with delicious sauce. Trimurti on Queen, for instance, offers the same quality of food at a lower price point. However, if you feel like Indian food, you can't go wrong with Jaipur."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good but not great.  Service was great and food was very good if a little bland. Even though i usually order mild or medium spicy at most Indian restaurants, at the Jaipur I tasted no spice in the vegetable paneer or the Madras chicken. And we did not especially ask to have the dishes made blander.  Overall, a good experience which caters to the white bread palate."}
{"text":"Great service and owner! Got an upset tummy after this place so wouldnt go back there. Be assured of great service while you are there."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I decided to go with my team for lunch here and I was very impressed. The food was more authentic than many other places around here (read Chef of India), and a great value for lunch. For $10 per head, including gratuity and taxes, we ate a good complete meal. I had the chicken tikka masala which I requested extra spicy, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Far better than going for a run of the mill buffet.  I went again with my brother and husband on a Saturday for lunch, and the food and prices were great again. The chaat for starters was also very enjoyable. The only reason that I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because when I went with my family, they did not ask us for chai/dessert (which we did actually want) and got us the bill straight. So we decided not to order those things and they lost out on some more money. Despite this, highly recommended for lunch (not sure about the dinner value)!"}
{"text":"The interior of Jaipur Grille (JG) is tastefully decorated with really simple yet elegant motifs. The tranquil atmosphere and aroma of spices escaping the kitchen made me happy just to sit by the window and sip on my mango lassi.   The appetizers; dahi bhalla chaat, samosa and tandoori wings were all fresh tasting. Tandoori wings and mint sauce pairing was especially good. I found the dahi bhalla pretty unusual and I can't really say I enjoyed it.   Main course dishes lacked variety. They were 3/4 identical, which took away from the fun of sharing. All dishes came with a side of rice, saag paneer and raita. The warm and fluffy naan came in generous portions. The saag paneer side was my favourite part of all the dishes I tasted. It had actual pieces of cheese and it was much more flavourful than the typical runny stuff you get elsewhere. The rogan josh lamb was tasty but a bit too heavily salted for me.    The fresh mango lassis and golab jamun (soft spongy dumpling infused with warm syrup and saffron) really hit the spot after the big meal.     The food, on the whole, was less than spectacular but the friendly and attentive servers along with the great atmosphere turned it into a good experience."}
{"text":"I have never felt the need to give a place a zero. This is hands down a ZERO but I don't have the option but to be generous on a One star here to write this review. In most cases I'm generous with the reviews. But, I would normally base that on food and service. Let's give you some background, I booked a reservation here online to dine at 10 pm, I even call them before I get there to let them know I will be there at 10 pm since I didn't receive a confirmation call and I also wanted to enquire if take out was an option since I was going to use one of those entertainment coupons. Off the bat, I should have understood what imbeciles I would be dealing with. After I very politely ask him on the phone about the coupon, the man who answers says no take out using the entertainment coupon only dine-in and before I could even reply, he got agitated and said I should have read the whole book even though it doesn't say anything on the coupon. Fine. I have a reservation already so no big deal, I tell him that's ok I have a table booked at 10pm and I will see them in a few minutes. We get to the restaurant and this retard of a manager walks up and says we're closed, kitchen is closed. I explain I just called and he makes it appear that I'm lying. I spoke to him 10 minutes before getting there!!!! Then I explain I had an online reservation and he's like ' I don't know why they have it like that online, they know we close at 10 pm. Excuse me, dumb much?! If they close at 10 pm why do you post an available table at 10 pm? He then suggests we get in touch with ppl online to correct it. No Sir, why the hell don't you do tht since you're the business? Now normally, in any given restaurant - there's an apology at this point. None. Instead he starts aggressively showing us the door while there are patrons in there dining watching this initially telling us there was no online rsvtn and then saying he saw it but doesn't know why that happened. Well if you noticed it, shouldn't you have called us and told us about the error and saved us a trip from Mississauga?! He was so rude - we decided to walk out of there than stooping to his level and decided to never go back there. With an attitude Like that I feel so very sorry for the staff that work for him, I mean if you can treat customers so poorly, I dread to think of what employees there go through everyday dealing with such an a jerk."}
{"text":"WOW, what a mouthwatering experience. We went for summerlicius and we ordered the chaat/tandoori wings, chicken/ lamb, glaub jamun. Every dish was cooked to perfection, the service is friendly and the place is clean. Looking forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch twice with others and have been underwhelmed.  It isn't terrible just bland and not particularly exceptional.  If you love Naan, they do give you an overwhelming amount."}
