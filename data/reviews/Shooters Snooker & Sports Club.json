{"text":"This place is pretty cool and interesting, it's a lot bigger than you think from the outside. The owners and employees are super awesome, I think it's a family business. I remember I was with someone who lost his wallet and they found it and kept it for him. There are cheap pool tables in the back that are just a couple bucks and also one in the front I think, you just pump in change. Other tables you pay per hour. The food is actually so fantastic! I really do recommend the burger, but ask for more toppings than what comes standard. Beer is average-priced, lots of hot dirty boys here"}
{"text":"I don't go for the games. I go for the excellent, casual service, drinks and food. Most dedicated restaurants aren't as good as this. Caring, thoughtful staff. You have to give it slack since its primary patron is there for the pool, not the things I  appreciate. It's just fine."}
{"text":"Great place to come for date night. No 1 bugs ya and plenty of tables to choose from. Nachos are surprisingly good as well."}
{"text":"Its a poolhall that serves booze. Owners and staff are great. Food is good. Definitely a place to frequent either as a first-time date or in a group outing"}
{"text":"this place is alright, ive been going here for a few years now ever since my friends had taken me to the place... it might be pretty intimidating to look at from when you first enter, by this i mean the people standing in front of the place smoking their cigarettes... but all in all its very much inviting, and relaxing...  anyway, once you enter through the super-tinted-mirrored glass door, you will be looking at another glass door, non tinted  and what you call this lovely, pool-table-filled area.   -there is a little walk-way to your right, and all the way to the end of this walk way, youll see two pool tables either vacant or occupied on which you can play for $2.00 per game (kinda like a vending machine where you put a toonie or two loonies into the slots attached, and youve got yourself & a couple buddies a game of pool to play :)   -if you like to play pool for maybe at least an hour, you can go to the bar (pretty obvious that its there when you walk in..) and tell the staff/employee at the bar that you want a table which is probably about $14 or $15 an hour and theyll give you a table and a set of pool balls. once you get to the table all youll need is the cue stick(s) which are normally found on the wall.   -the bar sells pretty good food, and 'drinks' if you are old enough of course...  you should check out this place is you havent yet :) enjoy!"}
