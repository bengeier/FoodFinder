{"text":"I live a million miles from here, but if life brings me north of 64th, a slice of Seniore's Donair pizza (a giant slice) is worth double what they charge."}
{"text":"Good pizza from a great little one off pizza shop! Go for the donair pizza..."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to change my review! We loved Seniore's, but after this experience, I don't know if we'll waste our time, money and calories there again, it was that bad. 
It took over an hour for our food to be delivered, and we live quite close. When I called after an hour, they just said \"It's on it's way.\" 
The wings were pitiful, like little pigeon wings. My jaw dropped when I opened the container, I couldn't believe how small they were! They were very hard and chewy, my husband had one and wouldn't touch another.
They sent some veggies and dip, which were nice and crisp, but had something on them that made them taste rotten. Spat that out.
And the donair pizza, which we know to be amazing, was terribly mediocre.
But the garlic sauce was good!"}
{"text":"These pizzas are generously loaded with cheese and everything amazing. I'm usually devoted to Atlas Pizza, but since I've moved to the NW, this has to be my new favourite. Prices are reasonable for the amount of toppings, and everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Two words for you. Donair Pizza.
A MUST for parties or a night in with friends!
The Chicken Special is also very good, and can balance out the heft of the Donair Pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good price light tasting crust could have cooked it a little longer but overall not bad value for your dollar"}
{"text":"pizza is yum. nothing fancy, but definitely hits the spot. right amount of crust and it's tasty! as a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, stay away from the chicken wings."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try because it has a lot of good reviews and we have trouble finding good pizza in the city close to us. We decided to go right in and order and take it home. The staff were super friendly and showed us a pizza they were bringing out for the display case for slices and it looked awesome. 
We ordered pepperoni, bacon and extra cheese and the large 3 topping was just about $20, that's pretty awesome. 
We really enjoyed the pizza but our bellies were a little upset after, not sure if it was the pizza or the ice cream we had later :/ haha. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!  Service is alright but they're always busy but defenitly Calgary's go-to for pizza - their meat pizza is my boyfriend's favourite and the slices are so nice and big !   
I highly recommend going to seniore's if you're craving a good pizza !!"}
{"text":"Its hit an miss nowadays. I live in the area and when this guy opened up shop he put a lot of time and effort into his pizza. Over the years, the quality has gone down but if the owner is at work you may end up with good pizza. The rest of the employees aren't the greatest at making the pizza, but they are friendly. Its usually super greasy."}
{"text":"It's late, zero outside,snow and ice on the ground, I call Seniore's, the guy gets the order right, delivers on time, I pay by debit card, the pizza is hot and tastes great. I like a tasty crust. Seniore's opens till late. Cold night, hot pizza, lame haiku."}

{"text":"If you want a quick filling pizza meal, this is the place to try. We've tried it twice, once we ate pre-made slices for lunch, and the other time we took away a made to order pizza for supper.  Both times the pizza was tasty, large portions, and a great value. The 2 slices of pizza for lunch came to $6.00

This place is always busy, so others are onto a good thing too.

{"text":"Donair pizza is great! Love that you can buy by the slice as well. Great guys working here as well - always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"What everybody else says about the donair pizza is totally spot on. Also had the combination special.  Excellent all around!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality but try and call them to order for puck up or delivery and you will be put on hold........for a few minutes if at all. This is strictly a walk In place."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza only. It's delicious. Toppings are incredibly fresh and generously spread over the pizza. Reasonable prices, pleasant service. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"LOVE seniores pizza! You get a lot of bang for your buck. And if you don't want a monster pizza you can get just a slice. I've never had a bad experience, delicious food every time! 

I've recommended them to lots of different people."}
{"text":"Oh Seinore's!

Their pizza is that perfect takeout-style. Fluffy thick crust that stays crisp until you finish the whole thing (don't judge), above average selection of toppings (artichoke hearts and fresh spinach?! Yes please!) and decent sauce. Price is right too at around $20 for a large (I get the salute vegetarian with seven toppings if I remember correctly).

Service is amazing too. They messed up on one of our pies, and I called back expecting maybe $5-$10 off our next order. No siree. The manager drove over, took a look at our order, apologized, then told us about the new procedure he'd put in place. Oh, and he replaced the ENTIRE order! Amazing. I'm not saying you should try and pull a fast one on them, as they're a mom and pop chain, but when they make a mistake, they fix it. 

Reccomend x100. For Serious."}
{"text":"amazing. They actually put enough toppings on the pizza, and it tastes incredible. Definitely worth the money and the crust on the pizza is like a breadstick! I would recommend this to anyone. Also they have huge pizza by the slice ovens so you can get grab a couple slices on the way home from work or on the way out for the evening. Great selection too. one of my favourite spots for great food I can count on!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive if you don't live near by. 
Awesome food all around great value!!!!
A+++++"}
{"text":"Checked out Seniore's a little late at night based on Yelp reviews when I was visiting Calgary in January and could not have been happier. Nice, thick cheesy as hell decadent slices. This is what my friends and I would refer to as \"Ninja Turtle Pizza\", which basically means it's amazing. When I'm back in Calgary, I'll be going to Seniore's."}
{"text":"Had the donair and chicken deluxe pizza. Both were filled with toppings. Crust was enjoyable and the sauce  we were given to dip it in was good too. However, I felt the amount of cheese and sauce was too much for my liking, plus it made the pizza sloppy to hold and eat. Next time I will have to try asking for half cheese half sauce. Decent prices with deals for ordering two pizzas."}
{"text":"Ho-lee-crap. Don't eat here.  It will ruin you for all other pizzas.  It is AMAZING.  Such great donair pizza, wicked by-the-slice, everything made with fresh ingredients and to top it off, the sweetest guys work there! A+"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza... I honestly don't get the hype this place gets. The pizza tastes like every other middle eastern owned pizza place...I've lived in New York and the pizza is nothing like this, at all.... I honestly don't understand the buzz. 

Also the service is terrible."}
{"text":"ooey gooey wonderfulness.

If you want a piece of heavenly pizza late at night, this is a right place to go and dig in. I love my pizza to be greasy, cheesy and thick crusted. They deliver me the right kind of pizza. I have been to this place more than 20 times in 3 months. Don't miss their wraps, they are as delish as their pizzas. If you are getting wasted its the right spot to feed you. Try their chicken parm and meat lovers pizza. If you are vegetarian please dont miss this place, they have lot of options for y'all and even though im a meat eater, I like their greek pizza :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and well priced. Friendly service, too. I thought the donair pizza is a bit odd but my partner loved it."}
{"text":"I've had Seniore's at a friends and I thought it was delicious, but I didn't live near it, so I went without for awhile. I then moved, and little did I know before choosing my new place, it was within walking distance of Seniore's! 

I have yet to decide if this is a curse or a blessing. My taste buds definitely love it, my gut and ass may not. I don't think a weekend has gone by in the last two months where I don't go at least once. Delicious pizza, good prices, and awesome service."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE their donair pizza here! 
I've tried the Hawaiian, pepperoni, meat lovers and always go back to delicious donair! 

Beef donair meat, sweet sauce, cheddar & mozzarella cheese are packed onto perfectly cooked dough and your final bites are the savory and sweet crust (still trying to figure out what they sprinkle on the crust to make it so good!)

We usually get our pizza (by the slice or whole pie) to go, there isn't much seating and the location is a bit sketchy lol

If you love donair and you love pizza this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place, so I checked it out twice.  At lunch, I opted to buy a couple of slices, as they were cheaper than a hole pizza.  I called one evening for a pick up order.  After placing the order, I was told pickup would be ready in 30 minutes.  I thought that was a long time to wait, but I ended up waiting another 15 minutes when I arrived.  Given they were busy, I thought that the pizza must be fantastic.  It wasn't bad, but not great either.  I would have given 4 stars if it wasn't for a 45 minute pickup pizza order."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and I'm so mad that I haven't had it and I literally drive by it everyday! First time for me. had the donair pizza but really wanted to try 1 of every pizza they had for pizza by the slice. what more can I say...but go try it for yourself, you will not be disappointed...its really that good. Full of toppings and oh so much cheese! I wish I would've got one more slice!  All positives for me...good job Seniore!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! This is a busy little pizza shop. I'm talking buzzing and hopping busy. Be prepared to wait if you need delivery so I usually pick up and even then you're probably waiting in a line there too. The donair pizza is seriously the best - hands down. My other go to is usually the chicken deluxe or chicken Parmesan. Fluffy, soft non greasy crust paired with the perfect amount of sauce and toppings. I've used these guys several times for lunch catering at work, placed my order the day before and have been pleased each time. I've probably tried all the different pizzas on the menu but the donair is a must try and always a favorite. Their salads are a nice addition to the pizza for catering. Two thumbs way up from this gal. Give them a try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp... this is one of those places that my bf and I would have never noticed or would even be remotely interested if it wasn't for the recommendations on Yelp.  My bf lives in Calgary all his life, and has never been to this place until I visited him and told him Yelp has good reviews on it... and ever since we stopped by Seniore's Pizza in the middle of the night for some chicken garlic and beef donair pizzas, we have yet to visit any other place in town for pizzas.  

Their pizzas are amazing, their hawaiian is drizzled with pieces of bacon, and for some reason, I always recalling pepperoni on it instead of ham.  Their chicken garlic pizza is very good. I personally don't care for the Seniore's special, but my bf loves it.  Donair pizza is good too! However, stay far far away from their chicken wings.

update: I am changing from my previous 5 stars to 4 because of the repeat bad experiences.  Maybe its my fault that I go there late at night around closing time, but seriously sometimes they just don't give a hoot about their pizzas anymore when they're about to close in an hour.  the wings are still crap, avoid the pizzas on the display rack - they can get old, dried out, and rubbery.  order a to-go entire pizza to guarantee yourself a good experience with this place."}
{"text":"First donair pizza! First time I'd ever even heard of it, I'm not from the area. All I can say is wow! It was amazing. We took about an hour before we picked up our pizza. One guy at the shop got after us for taking so long to pick it up which I thought was weird. But as we were pulling out someone ran out to our car and offered to make us a fresh hot pizza. We turned it down, tired and hungry, but were so grateful for the generous offer considering it was our fault we hadn't picked it up earlier. With the great service and even better pizza I'd definitely order from here again if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"best pizza in Calgary.  do yourself a favor and get the donair pizza."}
{"text":"This is by far the best donair pizza that i had. But too bad they dont deliver to south side of Calgary."}
{"text":"Always good. Never fails. It's busy as hell and hot inside so order ahead. I even stop by once in awhile for a slice and pop for lunch. Fair prices really good pizza? Perfect. The only issue is that the chicken wings are a little weak but the rest rocks."}
{"text":"Oh sweet pizza heaven...I ordered a half Combination special, half ham pineapple and bacon. Plus, I thought I'd give the garlic cheese bread a try. Everything came exactly as ordered (delivered to my door) and it was oh, so delicious! The garlic sauce that came with the bread was a nice surprise and very tasty! Really rich pizza - this is definitely not for the faint of heart. Make sure you have a good appetite when you order from here, or plan to have awesome leftovers!!"}
{"text":"First time in Calgary and got in late to the hotel. This pizza place looked great to order from, but told us they didnt come to are hotel that is 5 km away when there busy and that they where busy...as a customer I dont fully understand how you can't manage a busy business and delivering at the same time unless your unorganized. Also I've taken two long flights to get here and I'm starving. I never really post negative post. It has to be said though that I'm really not impressed"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of stumbling on this place on a recent trip to Calgary. It's quite small and geared mostly toward take-out. They are open late, unlike a lot of nearby places in the area. We tried the hot wings and a slice of beef donair pizza. Both were delicious. Will be looking for Seniores on my next visit to Calgary."}
{"text":"Visit 1: 5 stars. Ordered a slice of donair beef pizza. The cost was right. 4$. ( a little less). When I got home and opened the box my eyes jumped at how perfect the slice of pizza was. It was to the best donair pizza I have yet in Calgary. This is a great place to grab a slice! Always full of people too!"}
{"text":"No better place than this one for late night pizza with an amazing dip! Best for after bars! Been around for a long time and I imagine it will be around for much longer! Cheap and tasty!"}
{"text":"Great for a late night slice, or if you are recovering from a wild night. Chicken and beef donair pizza's are great. Also a fan of the meat lovers."}
{"text":"Really great quick pizza! Served by the slice is our fav, especially the garlic dipping sauce. Lasagna lacked flavor. Really busy joint, lots of workers. Fast! Weekly spot."}
{"text":"They are SUPER busy!  The Donair pizza is addictive! They have other things like pasta dishes as well.  They definitely care about customer satisfaction and compensate quickly and happily if there's any issues.  Great attitude here!  Great pizza and great prices!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint is great! I heard about how good it was through some friends and wasn't convinced until I tried it myself. Def a sick joint in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing food. 

When I phoned Seniore's Pizza. The customer service was awesome, I don't remember who I talked to but the young lad answered every question I had and gave me a few suggestions to save money.

The delivery probably took 35 minutes which isn't had at all. The delivery guy was awesome and very friendly. He asked about the hockey game etc. And tried to make conversation which I find great. 

When I got the food I wasn't disappointed at all. I ordered a medium pizza with ham and bacon as well as Greek salad. The pizza was a decent size and the salad was actually really big. They both tastes amazing! 

I recommend  Seniore's Pizza to anyone in the NE and NW! 

PS free delivery if you're close!!"}
{"text":"Thanking my lucky stars for Yelp as how else would I have known to request a U-turn at the next block to go into this unknown plaza (for us)!!! No seating really, just your typical take out place...

1:38am (they close at 2am)

Me - 'Ohhh crap, yep, it must be closing time as they only have meat choices left.' (I like my pizza veggie-style)
Donair slice - 'Pick me, pick me!'
Owner - 'Donair is our most popular ma'am, people drive from all the way south end and Airdrie to get it.' He smiles.
My Hubby - 'I like meat...'
Me - 'Oh for crying out loud, fine, one slice please.'

$3.20 a slice, not bad.

PAUSE - getting into car.

Me - 'OMG, this is AMAZING!!!!!' 

Never had a donair slice in my life. I am not even a huge donair lover in general but I am now! The meat was perfectly mild and the crust nice and soft. The sauce was a sweet concoction that I will never forget! What is IN that sauce? Accompanying it was a lovely garlic dip - soooo good!
Of course I cannot deduct a star because they did not have several choices 15 min before closing. Nor can I fault them that they do not deliver to our area. We will happily drive to get more. (I should have bought the other couple that were left :(  )
The stafff (owner?) was so nice. He even offered to make me a full pizza when he saw I was not sure about the meaty slices left before my ultimate choice. But he sold me on the donair and I am glad he did.

You must go here!"}
{"text":"This is literally some of the best pizza I've had in Calgary. The crust is so good - it's almost a fried bread texture. The toppings are piled high, and the slices are gigantic. We had the donair, which was especially good after a night of drinks with friends. We will definitely be ordering from this place in the near future."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years always loved the pizza and the beef donair. The slices are huge and a great place to grab a slice. Definitely always recommend this place to try."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery the Greek special and the salute vegetarian late on Friday. The food was here in 20 minutes. It is so good. The crust is perfect the sauce is so tasty. The pizza at seniors is definitely made with love."}
{"text":"I always go here for pizza and the donair pizza is the best, I usually get great service here but today I've had it with this place.

I ordered pizza to go and the cashier said 20 minutes... Almost an hour now and I ask the cashier how long and I can see the pizza just being made.. He tells me \"oh it's just being put in, do you wanna wait?\"

Are you kidding me????? They were busy but come on! If I ordered before then I expect my pizza to come in before those other ppl in the queue!!! 

Asked for a refund and he had to give me cash when I paid for credit?? UNBELIEVE! If you wanna order pizza here just call in advance by a good hour plus, you will be in turmoil trying to order to go there holy!"}
{"text":"If the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lived in Calgary, they would eat nothing but Seniore's.

When the only thing that will slay your mutant monster appetite is a saucetastic, cheesy to the max piece o' pizza with enough caloric energy to fuel a supersonic fighter jet - Seniore's Pizza is the place to be!

I ordered a slice of the Donair Pizza, and as I was about to pay, what to my eyes did appear, but a piping hot, fresh out of the over Chicken Donair pizza, and my name written all over it. One slice of this gold is more than enough to fill me up...for 3 days, but I've got a fever for the flavour, and went for the second piece. I regret nothing!

Pizza crust smothered in hot, creamy, sweet, and garlicky donair sauce, topped with donair meat (or chicken) and enough cheese to string down the face and shirt of the daintiest eater. Be warned, if you try eat this in your car, you WILL be wearing it.

They give you a dixie cup full of garlic sauce to the crust in. While you will be tempted to slam the sauce back straight from the cup like a saucy shot glass, try your best to save it for the crust. It's worth it.

Times I've been able to drive past Seniore's without getting pizza  = 0.
It's a good thing this place isn't along my regular route."}
{"text":"The best donaire pizza in Calgary. Wait time sucks sometimes but the food is so worth it. I'd recommend calling in your order to avoid waiting 30 minutes for a slice of pizza. It's and easy place to miss, but if you're a calgarian, im sure you've heard of seniores and you're missing out if you haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas, great customer service, very busy place. They have a small eat in area. Wings just Ok"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good pizza by the slice. Seems always fresh when we go for lunches. Has a variety of pizza by the slice. Fair price. We go often."}
{"text":"I don't normally order a pizza for dinner, but I was running late and didn't have time to make anything and this place was on the way home.  Given the outstanding Yelp reviews on Seniore's Pizza, I thought I should at least give it try to see if its pizza is any good.  The Donair Pizza has good reviews so it was my logical choice to order.  Pizza was still hot when I got home and it was one of the best pizzas I have tasted.  The Donair sauce and toppings are innovative.  I normally do not eat the crust but it was so soft and fluffy that combined with the dipping sauce was a combo that I couldn't resist.  Next time I crave pizza, I will come back and try the other pizzas they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Order their pizza once before and it was nothing special taste bland, I don't understand the great reviews.

We tried them a second time, three donairs and chicken wings. Food arrived 1 1/2 hours later, cold and unejoyable.The donairs where mostly lettuce oozing with sauce that caused the wrap to become soggy and fall apart with a small amount of meat inside. waste of 50$.

I didn't bother to call and complain as I didn't even want any food from them again."}
{"text":"Seniors pizza is delicious!  When you're going to have pizza, might as well go all the way!  Make sure you try to donair pizza and get extra donair sauce on the side for dipping.  Honestly that's the first and only type of pizza I've tried there, I know what I like and I stick to it!"}
{"text":"best pizza in the city, officially in the herald as best, and officially in my books.  Its Donair pizza or nothing now."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome with it's great pizza and just it's general vibe. you get your pizza so fast and it is pretty good pizza. The sauce that they have is really good as well, actually one of my favorites. 

Would recommend"}
{"text":"Donair pizza is really good and pizza slices come with a garlic dipping sauce. This is my go to place whenever I crave a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend and i love it every time. Very convenient because they are open until 2-3AM so if you are coming home from a party or a dance it will be open. Staff is always so nice and friendly when on the phone or when you walk in. They display their pizza in front of you so that you really can know what you are getting. LOVE"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE 19 YEARS ON THIS EARTH. I have no clue if they put drugs in it... probably.
Granted, I have been there about 20 times and the only one I have tried is chicken Parmesan but I have never been disappointed. Ever. 
Thank you Seniore's for exceeding my pizza expectations and making my pizza dreams come true."}
{"text":"Love that you can get pizza by the slice we were able to try a few different  kinds, one slice is the size of a plate!! Service was fast and efficient! Will definitely return in the future! You can tell why this place is busy!!"}
{"text":"I seriously don't eat pizza anywhere else anymore. If you're in town, new to town, or if you were born and raised in town but for whatever reason you were also living under a rock- you have to try the DONAIR PIZZA here. Crazy waits on Friday and Saturday nights so definitely call ahead and prepare to wait an hour. They also sell by the slice  so it's a great place to go to if you're looking for a heavy but insanely delicious lunch. Amazing pizza but I wouldn't recommend any of the pastas, they're just nothing special and you could probably get better pasta at an Italian restaurant for the same price (try Chianti's on their pasta nights but not the location on 14th). Also, parking is impossible on busy nights so you're going to have to tag team with someone as they circle around the block and you run inside."}
{"text":"very good pizza . This is some of the best in the northwest.  The Donair pizza is signature"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Seniore's for the longest time, with most stories referring to a strong case of the food coma post-consumption. I ordered take out on a Friday night for 2 small pizzas (their specialty donair pizza and a 1-topping mushroom pizza for a \"lighter\" alternative).

I was told over the phone that it would be ready in 45 mins. We got there in 45 mins as told, and I was floored by the scene when I got there. This little 600 square feet pizza shop, which is intended for mainly take out (with only ~3-4 bar stools facing the front windows) was packed! It was insane. It put the neighboring restaurants in the same strip mall complex to shame. Even though we got there at the right time, we were told at arrival that our pizzas would need an additional 10-15 mins before it was ready. All in all, we waited an hour, but it was understandable given how busy they were. Not to mention, it was well worth the wait in the end. Seeing how busy this place was definitely hyped up my excitement. If you're looking for a greasy pizza, this is your place. And the rumours are true; the donair pizza is two big thumbs up - it was loaded with donair meat, mixed in with a generous amount of sweet sauce. I am so glad that we got the 1-topping pizza as our 2nd choice, because I think two specialty pizzas would've been way too heavy. To my fellow Yelpers, the conclusion of my review is that the hype IS real. If you need some late night hangover food, Seniore's is the place (also, did I mention they're open until 4am?). Skip McDonald's, go to Seniore's instead, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite pizza place locally. The crust isn't too deep nor is it greasy. Delivery can be slow at times, but that's the price you pay for having spectacular pizza."}
{"text":"Review #1 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

Lived in the Seniore's Pizza hood (10 minute driving distance) for 10 years and never heard of this place.  

Then one day while trying to find a quick dinner for a Friday Evening Movie Night with the family.......I stumbled across Seniore's Pizza.  Well at least 2/3rds of this family are pizza crazy and all the reviews I'd read were very positive.  Sold.

Hubs came home with a lovely bottle of vino, we checked out their website and online specials, the call was placed, pizza ordered and movie chosen.  We went with the \"pick it up\" option to get some kind of discount promo since we really were not that far away.

25 minutes later 2 x 2 topping pizzas were brought home along with an order of salt & pepper wings.  Eating this pizza made me think about another long ago favourite pizza joint/pub of ours called Atlas pizza....it was delish.   The only real disappointment was the wings.  They were deep fried to a crisp and I mean crisp.  Some of them were so tough to eat & shriveled (being over done) you could not get a bite of chicken meat off the bone.

None the less we didn't try this place for the wings but for the pizza.....and it was thoroughly enjoyed.  In fact the kidlets ate more than they usually do which is also a good sign.  

Nice to find a good pizza joint in the neighbourhood and a go to when wanting to order supper in!!"}
{"text":"This is the place if you're looking for a delicious pizza and not caring about calories. It is delicious because it's packed full of delicious toppings and sauce.  I can only eat one piece but it is highly worth it.  The pizza is very rich, heavy and bursting with flavour. This place is famous for its donair pizza but then I learned that the chicken donair pizza was even better.  Don't forget to get the garlic sauce that comes with it. This place is always packed and for good reason.  This is also a great pizza to bring to potlucks and parties; it is always a hit."}
{"text":"I had heard SO much hype about Seniore's and was finally able to give them a try a few weeks ago. Of course, we had to go with the Donair seeing as so many people recommended it. I LOVE donair pizza so I was really excited. It took about 45 minutes to prepare and was piping hot when we took it home. 

The pizza was delicious and satisfying, but I found it VERY heavy. The garlic sauce was tasty but - dare I say - just too much of a good thing. Delicious after a night of drinking, I'm sure...but just way too greasy on a sober stomach. I would probably eat it again if someone else ordered it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it. Overall, I enjoyed the pizza, but my tummy did not."}
{"text":"We had the Seniore's special omg! It was so delicious! Very flavorful tons of toppings, good amount of sauce, and a soft crust. We are definitely coming again. This place also offers pizza by the slice which I think is a good way to try out some different toppings. If you decide to deliver they do not take credit card payments over the phone."}
{"text":"Someone said something about the pizzas at this place being the best she has had in her life. Well, I'm here to confirm the pizza is every bit as good as described. The personnel are friendly, but the place is not really comfortable for a family. You should order your pizza to-go as there's not enough room inside the place. We ordered three custom pizzas with 5 toppings on each, one vegetarian, one chicken and four vegetarian toppings, and a pizza that I would imagine would constitute as a meat-lover. Even though we randomly chose the toppings, all of them were exceptional, even the vegetarian one. I definitely would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Om nom nom nom nom! P is for pizza, it's good enough for me. Like Cookie Monster's love of cookies, I am fast developing an even deeper love of all things pizza (and must remind myself that pizza is a \"sometimes food\").

Might I say, this pizza spot is a wee bit out of the way for me. But I'll be making the trek up that way again. Seniore's touts itself as \"the best pizza on earth\" (for real, it's the slogan on the website). When I walked in, I was greeted by a man I assumed to be the owner, he was certainly passionate enough about his pizza to be the owner (I'll refer to him as the owner for the purposes of this review). There were two glass carousels with about 5 different kinds of pizza ready to be sold by the slice. There were no labels, but the owner eagerly named off each different kind. I couldn't decided, so I asked him what his favourite kind was. He hummed and he hawed almost as much as I did. Finally, he pointed to the chicken pizza and said \"that one.\" So that's what I ordered.

After scooping up a slice for me and ringing it up along with my bottle of Dad's Rootbeer, he looked up at me perplexed. \"I should've told you to get the donair pizza, it's everyone's favourite,\" he said. \"But you asked me what my favourite was, and I gave you my favourite... but still, I should've told you to get the donair pizza.\" He paused for a moment and then continued to say: \"You can switch them if you want, I haven't given you this one yet, I'll let you switch for the donair pizza.\" How awesome is that?

I stuck with the chicken pizza, but ordered a slice of donair pizza to take with me for dinner later that evening. Anyone who gets that perplexed about his recommendation for my lunch gets a 5-star in my books, especially when his pizzas turn out to be 5-star slices as well.

One other thing, pizza by the slice comes with a nice big container of dipping sauce (and is less than $3 a slice during lunch hour). While he was getting mine, I asked him what kind of dipping sauce it was (it's a creamy sauce made with garlic). He looked a bit surprised and asked me if this was my first time at Seniore's Pizza. When I confirmed that, indeed, this was my first visit, he got a little smirk on his face and said \"Ah, well it's the best pizza in world. It'll soon be your favourite.\" So far, it gets the title, and I foresee that it'll remain in my top 5 for some time to come at the very least."}
{"text":"Tiny take out place in a strip plaza with a lot of character. Great, friendly service and a wide variety of pizzas. You can even order by the slice to try different flavours.  I had a small veggie, hubby had a small everything- every meat, 6 veggies and cheese. Our son had a slice of chicken donair pizza. Everything was very tasty...good chewy crust and yummy toppings. Definitely stop here!"}
{"text":"i ate the donair pizza and now I can see new colours.
incredible, wonderful.
the staff was so nice that I almost asked if they could adopt me into their pizza-making family and I'd be a pizza chef and live my life in a kitchen making pizzas

but i didn't

i just ate donair pizza and smiled

thank you seniore's


thank you so much"}
{"text":"BEST pizza place in Calgary by far and that's an understatement. i've been living in Calgary for my entire life and seniores has, and i'm sure will continue to be my favourite pizza place ever!
something really important as a high school student, and now as a college student is seniores operating hours. most days they stay open till 2AM or later which is always nice to know when your young and looking for a late-night snack. the unfortunate thing is that they're closed on sundays :(
mm the super greasy over-sized slices (well-priced too i might add) are beyond addicting. i know friends who ate at this pizza shop literally EVERY single day we were in high school. and i can easily see how anyone would be capable of doing so. i love this place! you have to HAVE TO go, whether you're local to Calgary or not! ten billion thumbs up"}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like a New Yorker at heart, until I actually visit New York and then I realise I am more of a Canadian in New York than a New Yorker, but when I am missing New York-- I like to visit Seniore's Pizza. 

It is constantly busy but in a good way. They have a hustle and bustle in an unorganised chaos sort of way and the staff is on top of whatever is happening around them. 

You can order take out or stop by for a slice or whole pizza to go. The prices are very reasonable, a slice is about $3.50. The Donair Pizza is a cult-favourite! I'm basing this  assumption on the fact that as I waited for 10 mins in line about 20 people ordered it. I got the veg pizza and I love it! I folded it to the perfect pizza \"sandwich.\" and scarfed it down in two minutes. (You guys know what I mean, right?)

Whatever pizza you select make sure you try the complimentary garlic sauce. It's bomb.com! I love the aesthetic of the neon lights, pizza chef mural, stool-seating area and it open lateness (I think past 2 AM). It does get crowded but that's why it reminds of New York and why I will be forever going to SP."}
{"text":"Pizza is always great, large portions and priced well. Staff is always welcoming, good choice if your looking for pizza and a good deal."}
{"text":"I am so damn pleased with Seniore's. 

Friday night, feeling super lazy, and decided to call for take out than get into my kitchen, blegh. I called up Seniore's, and ordered two pizzas- one Greek Vegetarian with added fresh spinach, and one Salute Vegetarian...both with no cheese.

The crust was honestly the best I have had in a very long time. crisp on the outside, but still so soft. Daaaamn. The selection of toppings and veggies were on point. I thought of adding some vegan cheese to these and throwing them in the oven for a few months, but seriously, no need. I loved this, because I didn't feel like I was going to seize into a greasy food coma. 

We will meet again, Seniore."}
{"text":"Wow, I just inhaled the best pizza slice I've ever had in Calgary.  I may end up sweating a bit of grease and garlic later tonight, but it's worth it.  Donair Pizza, my friends.  Eat it.

My spontaneous first time walk-in this afternoon exposed me to some seriously efficient service and attentive staff.  My money was barely out of my wallet before my food was handed to me.  I must add that the pizza box is solid and holds the grease well, not leaching through to the bottom.  Thumbs up.  

The Donair Pizza itself is made with generous amounts of beef donair meat, cheddar and mozza cheese.  Some kind of \"sweet sauce\" is on it too and for the first time ever, I don't care what's in it because it's just that good.  A side of this \"sweet sauce\" was sent along with me and I drenched my pizza crust in it.  The single slices are substantial and this glorious experience cost me $3.20.  

I'm really looking forward to ordering a full pizza from here.

{"text":"It's not the best pizza in town, or the best pizza in the area, but it serves a specialty known as the donair pizza. Domino's has since made an effort to duplicate it, but you can't beat the local original. 

Order one and experience it yourself."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time but then since I've moved to another part of the city I only get to Seniore's once in awhile.  The last three or four times I've been has compelled me to change my review from five stars down to two stars.  Here's why:

I usually get the donair pizza and the past few times it has gotten worse and worse until last night, which might be the eventual end of my donair relationship with Seniore's Pizza.  First of all there was quite the line so I waited my turn.  I was next in line when the guy behind the counter immediately helps the guy to my right.  I spoke up and the guy in line behind me even mentioned it to them.  The guys behind the counter mumble under their breath and start cracking jokes like it wasn't my place to say anything.  When the guy behind me insisted I be helped before him (he was trying to do right by me) that was when they decided to help.  I ordered my donair pizza and when paying I mentioned to the guy that it would be beneficial for him to call out who was next instead of assuming who the next person was in a room full of people.  His response was that he did call out.  Regardless, I didn't hear it.  I took my slice and left.

Trying to eat the pizza was a soggy mess.  The crust hadn't even crisped at all; it was still pretty raw and didn't cook through.  It was by far one of the most difficult slices of pizza I've ever eaten.  Even after folding the slice in half it was drooping like a sad kid's face when he's told THERE IS NO SANTA.  Also the sweet sauce was just way too sweet it was almost a nuisance to eat.  The donair meat tasted like salty pieces of dried up chicken skin.  The crust was the best part of the pizza, no, I take that back, the cardboard box was the best part.  In the trash it went along with my business."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place lots had to try it , now me and my family are addicted to it! Donair pizza yum, friendly service , and love that when I call in my order they say my name . Chicken donair pizza a must ,,,, don't forget the garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"Donair pizza is super greasy but super good like the oil actually seeps through the box and you feel like you need to go poopoos after that's why I can't give it a 5 stars but it is tasty"}
{"text":"Favourite pizza in Calgary for sure! The donair pizza is to die for, so much garlicy creamy donair sauce & so much cheeese!! mm. Probably not recommended for people trying to watch their calorie intake though. Will return again and again until the day I die. Lol"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the wings, a bit on the dry side. HOWEVER, I still gave them a 5 because the pizza is phenomenal. The sauce has just the right amount of tangy and sweet flavor to it. The crust is also perfect, neither too crunchy, nor chewy... nice savory flavor. The Donair pizza is delicious too. Friendly guy who delivered my pizza.  Also love that they're open late :) Great experience overall, will be coming back."}
{"text":"Seniore's is great, classic pizza.

While pretty out of the way, I will have to keep this place in mind if ever on my way to or from the airport.

There is not much to the interior: a counter (with a pizza oven behind it) and a few barstools along the window ... and there doesn't NEED to be anything more to it. Cause this place is all about the pizza.

You can buy it by the slice, or order a whole pie. If you order pizza, it will (naturally) be more fresh than the slices waiting to be served, but it is good either way.

Each slice comes with a small cup of \"white sauce\" (ranch dressing), which is a nice touch. The tables also have hot sauce (Sriracha or Frank's) which also gives you some options.

I am very curious to try other things on the menu (like the donairs or the pasta), but I think it will always be hard to deviate from the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza in town really fresh i will strongly recommended Spicily the beef Donner and really great price so you can enjoy a great pizza without breaking the bank"}
{"text":"I was visiting Canada for work and decided to pick up some pizza before my flight back to the U.S.   I wasn't sure what a donair pizza was so I googled it and it sounded decent so I have it a shot. 

Now I don't really have anything similar to reference in the US (I'm a Chicago deep dish fan) but this pizza is fantastic. Great amount of cheese, donair meat is awesome, crust is perfect and the dipping sauce seals the deal.  

I got some wings but honestly didn't eat them because the pizza was so good. I"}
{"text":"I don't care for it, sorry.  It's just ok pizza, I think the lure is the giant serving sizes and friendly service which is great but this pizza by far is the greasiest pizza I've ever consumed.  

We ordered their XL meat lovers, beef and mushroom and the donair pizzas - both the donair and meat lovers were literally drenched in fat, I've had similar offerings at other independent pizza places and they were nothing like this.  Plus the donair pizza wasn't served the way it's described in the menu, there were no toppings on it other than the donair meat and sauce, it could have been an oversight but I didn't call back to let them know of this mistake.  Also the pizzas were overwhelmingly sweet- I don't know whether it's the sauces, or sugar in the dough but it's just too much, the meat lovers was just a sodium overload, my company, who shared the pizza with us, agreed and the only redeeming pizza was the beef and mushroom but still found there was a sweet undertone to that pizza as well. 

If you like huge portions, sweet, salty and greasy pizza with great service this is the place for you, plus they are open super late.  However, I prefer quality over quantity, so it's not likely I will order from this place again. Great guys running it though."}
