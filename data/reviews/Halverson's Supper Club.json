{"text":"We recently moved to Lake Kegonsa and have eaten here 4 or 5 times. The fish fry is great and you can't beat their old fashioned. Twice we sat in the dining room and twice in the bar area. We've gone over on our boat twice as well and the floating dock had good cleats and the water was deep enough for our inboard boat. We will be back quite a bit and have not had anything we didn't. The potstickers and cheese curds are great as well as the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Used to come to Halverson's often as a kid. Stopped last night for prime rib and one word describes our dinner- awful!! Prime rib was tough. Ordered it rare, came out medium. Coconut shrimp had no flavor. Looked good though. I gave this trip 1 star cuz the waitress was efficient and engaging."}
{"text":"I was very pleased about the haddock ( fried).  It was done just right.  The service was excellent.  There was a 40 minute wait on Friday night.  We arrived at 7pm.  The coffee was excellent.  I really like the down home atmosphere."}
{"text":"I just got back from a 3 day canoe trip down the Yahara River chain starting in Madison.  We stayed two nights down the street at the Crown Point Resort so we ate here two nights in a row.  I was not disappointed.  The first night I had the stuffed chicken with an appetizer of potato skins.  I'm not the kind of guy who eats at Chili's, so I hadn't had potato skins in years.  These were perfect - pure Wisconsin.  Good cheddar, flavorful crispy bacon bits, with enough potato left on the skin.  They were piping hot, but the cheese wasn't burnt.  The soup was tasty as was the main course including the green beans.  My buddy got a slap of ribs.  They must have known we had worked up an appetite because they served up a 15 inch slab.  He finished the left over 2 ribs the next day.  He said they were good.  The following night we came back for the Fish Fry.  I hadn't had a Haddock Wisconsin fish fry in years, so you might want to take that into account, but it was really good. I'd heard this place when through some difficulty a while back, but it's quite good now and the prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Some times the unexpected happens.  We were expecting an ordinary fish fry, what we got was a very good fish meal,very good service and an atmosphere that was very pleasing. Cloth table cloths, need I say more."}
{"text":"This place has completely gone south.  We've been eating here several times per month for 8-10 years and won't go again.   The great service is gone, and the food is awful.  This used to be our favorite restaurant, and we'd always ask family for gift certificates as a Christmas present.  Shame; this used to be a really great place to eat."}
{"text":"I would drive past this place almost once a week but had never stopped...till now. It's one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" kind of places. The menu is far more extensive then you would assume. There were so many choices my boyfriend and I were having a hard time deciding what to choose. We settled on the Friday fish fry and the fried chicken. We also got potstickers for an appetizer and I got their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. I loved their martini and everything else was pretty dang tasty too. If you get a potato option choose the potato pancake, you won't be disappointed. We went on a Friday and there was live music. Our waitress said they have music every other weekend. The service was a tad slow for my liking but everything else was great. We will be going back."}
{"text":"After a 90 year run, Halverson's has closed it´s doors and will no longer serve the Lake Kegonsa región."}
{"text":"Truely wounderful resturant.  Great steaks and fish and a good price for the quality of food they provide.  The service is terrific and they are great with children.  One of our favorites."}
{"text":"Went to Halverson's for a fish fry on a busy Friday night. It took a while to get seated but it was well worth the wait. We found out they do take reservations. I ordered a classic Brandy Old Fashioned & it was very tasty. For dinner I ordered the 4 piece fish fry dinner. The fish fry was fantastic! The service was good especially considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"The quintessential Wisconsin supper club. All the standards with a real step up in quality. Start with the brandy Old Fashion and sit down to a superb fish fry. From the homemade bread proceed to a nicely spiced coleslaw. We tried the baked haddock and the fried bluegill. Delicate fish cooked very well. Not too much batter or spice. The horseradish mashed potatoes were good, but be sure to try the Parmesan potato cake. By the end there was no room for dessert so you are on your own. Give this classic a try!"}
{"text":"Update: sad but not surprised this placed closed. I don't know the backstory but from observations it seems like the place has been going downhill fast for the past 2 or 3 years. The advantage of only eating one thing (Friday night fish fry) at a place is that it makes it easy to observe downtrends.  They lost a lot of their long time servers about a year ago. They also didn't seem to be putting any money into repairs or general maintenance.  Too bad because at one point these guys probably had Madison's best fish fry.   This place used to be our absolute favorite place for Friday fish fry in all of the madison area but over the last year or so they have just been going down hill.    On our last visit we were told the wait would be 30 minutes and it ended up being over an hour.  This wouldn't be the end of the world except that we observed the hostess seat 2 different couples who came in after us, ahead of us (and no, they didn't have reservations).  The nail in the coffin was a combination of a terribly trained server and the kitchen.    Our server brought out our app and never came back. She then asked if we wanted dessert...which we then informed her that we'd like our entree that we ordered (fish fry).  It came out quickly....too quickly. The fried fish was stone cold raw.  How do you undercook fried fish?!  The manager kindly offered to replace it, which we declined and chose to leave (it was removed from our bill).  I might try them just one more time because they used to be so amazing...but they may just be another slowly dying supper club...and it's a shame."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:30 put our names in because of a 45 minute wait. Which was odd because of so many open tables. Upon putting or names in we went to the bar for something to drink and we were completely ignored by the bartenders for 15 minutes. Once we finally received drinks we sat out on the patio area to wait. At 7:15 we received our table. The waiter brought us water right away, then came back 5 minutes later to take our order. An hour later, at 8:15 we finally revived our salads. Finally at about 9:00 we had had enough, after over an hour and a half of waiting for our meal while everyone else around us was being seated, served, and eating. Anytime we brought it to there attention they kept making excuses. Enough was enough, for such a staple in the area you would think they would be much more service friendly. I have heard the food is great, but i couldn't tell ya."}
{"text":"My wife and I waited for 30 mintues which usually is not a big deal, but when I looked inside the dining room, I literally found 6-8 open tables for two, so that was really strange.  It's almost like each server can only have a certain number of tables.  So beware, the service isn't the best, which is about the only negative thing I can say about this place because the food was outstanding.  We both had the fish fry, my wife had the battered and I had the baked.  I consider myself somewhat of a fish fry critic and I was personally blown away at how good the baked was.  It wasn't extremely flaky like most baked haddock filets are, it was almost like a fish steak, and seasoned perfectly.  Overall, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"It was my first go at Halverson's. We had a large party with 7 adults, 4 kids, and a 1 year old. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. That was where the service ended. We were seated and given nothing but menus. No water bread or anything else. Around 15 minutes later we placed a drink order. We were apologized to about the restaurant being short staffed. It was only moderately busy. Our waters were never filled. We found a pitcher ourselves and divided out our rations. Around 10 minutes later we placed a food order having not yet received our drinks or any further water. As well we were yet to receive a bread basket despite the table full of at this point melting down 1 to 5 year olds. During this waiting process we fed our 1 year old. We fed her a bar, some apple sauce in a packet, and a few puffs. Eventually we finally got some drinks and around 15 minutes after drinks were served we got our bread basket and dinner. I must say that the old fashioned and fish fry was fantastic which is where my hesitancy to not give more than 1 star comes from. I would have given another star despite the terrible service except for one aspect which I found odd. On our bill was included a $3 open food charge. This was placed on our tab for us feeding our 1 year old!!! This is really unheard of for me. Would I have been charged for feeding an infant a bottle? She didn't eat a single thing off of the plates of food that we ordered and ate a few tiny bits of bread and a cucumber from my salad. If she did eat off the plate of fish who cares because my wife and I over order (4pc vs 2 pc on my wifes plate) in order to have a few bites for the little. Really a strange experience. I left a 10% tip though still because the persons who made the delicious old fashioned and delicious fish deserved a bit of a tip."}
{"text":"My family and I love Halverson's!  The service is excellent and the food is good.  Location of the restaurant is perfect.  No smoking and a better variety of beer would improve an already great place.  Your whole meal will take a long time, that's part of the experience."}
{"text":"Let's start out with I love the authentic, Wisconsin supper club atmosphere here.  It has been around since the 1920's so I am not surprised.  The wait staff was friendly but they have a tendency to forget about you.  Once you get your drink, it doesn't matter as much.  They pour a solid drink as the Old Fashioned my wife had was solid.  The steak I had was not great.  The flavor was there but it was full of tendons and this was a strip steak.  Then again the price was there.  I recommend getting a smaller steak.  The filet was good but the one with the bourbon cream sauce was too sweet for my taste.  The parmesan potato cake had the flavor and right idea but the execution wasn't there.  It was so thick that it was a little cool in the middle.  The veggies were forgettable too.  The real reason to come here is the fried food.  The fish fry and the fried cheese curds are the real McCoy.  As good as any I've ever had.    Sure it's a mixed bag, but if you live in Stoughton or are visiting Lake Kegonsa, make a stop. The place has character and does some things very well. I would go back again."}
