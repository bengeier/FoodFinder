{"text":"Lovely place. I was searching for a cafe with sweets and got this place as an option. The coffee is great and the ambiance is very unique and cozy... I just love it and will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Drove by many times and thought I might check it out. The tarts were amazing but better still was the jazz. 4 different performers every 2 hours. Such a great find!!!"}
{"text":"My husband saw this business on news in the TV and he thinks it looks like a very unique place. As we were driving by the place, we decided to check it out. We both had lunch plate: savory tarts with mixed green salad, tea and butter tart. It was yummy! Everything is made here from scratch using all natural Ontario butter, organic  12 grain flour and other local ingredients. The service was friendly and personal.  I will definitely come back here with my friends. Next time, I will try their coffee and I would also like to try their afternoon high tea."}
{"text":"I live nearby and this place is amazing. Their raspberry tart is my personal favourite. They have a nice selection of tarts and other baked goods to keep everyone satisfied. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Now this is the story all about how  My life got flipped, turned upside down  And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I found this cool new caf√© to share.  In Western Toronto, born and raised  The Tartistry is where I spend most of my days  Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool  And all shooting some lattes outside of the school  When a couple of desserts they were tasting so good  Started Yelping AWESOME in my neighbourhood  I got in one little review, and The Tartistry prepared  \"Now everyone go get lattes, desserts and WiFI impaired\"  I whistled for deliciousness and when it came near  This place screamed \"FRESH\" with a price in the clear.  If anything I could say, this Decor was rare  But I thought nah, forget it, \" What else can compare?\"   I was, feeling so full after seven or eight  And yelped it OUT! \"Yo, homes yes they cater!\"  Looked at this kingdom, I was finally there  To sit on my throne, now Tartistry's flare."}
{"text":"This was a somewhat odd find. Looking to pick up a dessert for guests on the trip back from Costco this place's name popped up.  Decided to give it a try. The place has a very kitschy setup right from the display window as once I walked in there was a LIVE jazz band playing. There was an odd placement of tables as it was difficult even to get to cashier (maybe a weekend thing). They have quite a few options  with a gluten free option to boot as well. I also saw some whole crumble pies on offer if you are planning to entertain a crowd. Decided to go with a a variety of tart options to try a few flavors. The lemon tart was just being filled so had to have those. Picked up a couple of coconut, blueberry and maple pecan. The lemon tart was decent with a lot of buttery goodness. Blueberry was average IMO. The coconut version which I didn't try was quite a hit (especially for a guest who can have only lactose free dessert) The guests were wowed, I was OK. So if you are into this type of tarts I would recommend a visit. 3 Star for moi with a half star thrown in for being a crowd pleaser. I will revisit to try the pie crumble for a larger group."}
{"text":"Almost everything is gluten free. So delicious! Saturdays they play live Jazz. Very cozy environment. Love this place."}
{"text":"Having never tried Butter Tarts, my (Canadian! Gasp!) boyfriend and I stopped in to see what they were all about. The shop is cute, with a cozy tea room vibe. There was quite a selection! Numerous flavors of sweet Butter Tarts along with some savory options (quiche, steak and ale pie, chicken tourtiere, etc. - all in the same single serving size as the Butter Tarts), and a variety of baked goods like brownies, turtle bars, and muffins. I believe there was at least one soup on the menu as well.   You get a price break for buying multiple tarts (sweet or savory) after 6 pieces, and again at 12 pieces (I believe). We went with a 6 pack to share. Their packaging is really great for take-out! It keeps the tarts separate, so nothing gets squished. We were advised to refrigerate the savory tarts if we weren't going to be eating them that evening, but to keep the sweet tarts out on the counter. (And that they would last approximately 1 week.)  I tried... the plain, coconut, and lemon Butter Tarts, sampling them over 2 days.  The plain was good. The texture inside was unlike anything I'd ever eaten before, but not overly sweet or cloying.  The coconut was delicious! I liked it more than the plain, although now that I have had a regular Butter Tart I would not turn one down if someone offered me one. ;) The coconut flavor was not overpowering, nor was it that fake too-sweet coconut taste that you get in a lot of coconut sweets. It was perfect!  The lemon was my personal favorite. I had it for breakfast with a cup of coffee. The filling was silky, and managed to be both delicately flavored and rich at the same time. A+!"}
{"text":"My first time here and the regular butter tart was amazing! The owner was friendly too. Ill definetly be back!"}
{"text":"Tartistry's tarts are a really good reason to get Diabetes.  You'll have no regrets.  Out of the oven very little is better on this planet."}
{"text":"This is an amazing bakery! Everything is gluten free and delicious. The scones are moist and the tarts are just fantastic. I also had the savory tarts and enjoyed those as well - especially in their full size. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you like your sweets very rich and...sweet, the tarts definitely embody that. Each one is about $3 and you can choose from a variety. I got blueberry, raspberry and pecan. The first two tasted like it, and wasn't as heavy. The pecan was very buttery.. So if you're into that, you'll love it.   The place sells odds and ends and does high tea. But not many tables. Pretty pricey, but if you have a sweet tooth I'd say give it a try. They take all forms of payment."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in my neighbourhood. The interior is sweet & quaint. You feel like you are in your grandmother's or favourite aunt's living room & she wants to feed you yummy tarts & tea. Got the classic butter tart. Would have loved morw filling but the crust is out of this world!! It is so buttery & a hint of salt. A must try. I could eat 5 of these"}
{"text":"Drive past the store front many times and decided to drop in for some good butter tarts. The interior is very quaint and filled various small antiques.  Purchased 2 plain and 1 pecan butter tart to go. And for 3 butter tarts the price was overwhelming clocking at over $10. Outrageous. I can find better tarts and for better price elsewhere because $10 for 3 tarts (over $3 per tart) is definitely a turn off for me.   As for the taste, the pecan has a bit of salt in it which was nice, it gave a nice contrast to the sweet. I'm thing the touch of saltines comes from the crust (which nice and flaky - perfect). The plain was good but I'd definitely has better (butter tart store in Maynooth, Ontario - These tarts of THE BEST!).   The biggest problem I have with these tarts is the texture of the fillings. A great butter tarts has a smooth filling but these ones has a texture almost like clumps of gelatin - not smooth at all.   Good butter tarts, but based on my issues with the weird gelatin texture and it being overly priced, I definitely won't being returning because I can find better tarts at a lower price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent butter tarts. Especially liked the pecan, maple and blueberry. Not kid friendly though (lots of breakable stuff in store). Slow service."}
{"text":"The two butter tarts I tasted from This place were phenomenal! The peanut butter chocolate and the original butter tart flavour were nothing short of what i would imagine the perfect butter tart to be. thankfully this place is nowhere near my house or place of work otherwise I'd develop the physique of Santa Claus.  Check out their stand at the christmas market. I hope this place delivers (no i dont) but a MUST TRY for anyone who loves butter tarts or just delicious, delicious food."}
{"text":"Melt-in-your-mouth-buttery-tarts. My Personal fave is the white chocolate tart...yum!   A hidden gem in south Etobicoke.  Would go back again and again!"}
