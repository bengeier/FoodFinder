{"text":"Yeh went here with the Mrs a couple of times on visits to Vegas,full of designer names won't go too deep with the description.I can say we had to pay an excess baggage fee on our return journey,and were twitching like drug smugglers, as we went through customs at Heathrow."}
{"text":"Update: The SDX goes straight here. Before you had to take the Deuce then make a transfer. It's easy to come here now. Other than that not much change. It's outdoors so you will either feel hot or cold. A good place to check out."}
{"text":"Extended hours for holiday shopping ...even sweeter with 60-80% off at my favorite stores ! Max Studio offering 25% off on top of marked down red tags, Polo is doing 50% off entire store, WHBM 50% off entire store, and Kate Spade 60% off entire store !!! More at other stores ..these discounts are valid thru next week (end on NY Eve according to most of these stores )....then when u all done head to gelato cafe and meet the cute French cashier (owner ??) and enjoy a nice cup of java!"}
{"text":"Happy New Year everyone!!!I spent 5 wonderful days in Las Vegas wth my family and friends. On the way back we decided to stop at this place for some last minute shopping. I want all of you consumers to be aware of the Asian man who sells the charger cords for the iPhones. He has them hanging freely and charges by the set. The chargers will last about 8 hrs and that's about it. He charged me 10bucks for two. I believe I purchased them Tuesday and they've already gone out. The mall is patronized by tourist so it's not like you can go back and demand a regular...???!. Also they could upgrade this outlet. It smells and most of their stuff is outdated. It's not compelling at all. I'm going to take my own advice and pass this place up like I've been doing"}
{"text":"This a nice outdoor shopping mall with 130 stores! The only thing I didn't like was shopping in the rain, other than that, this is one of my favorite place in Vegas."}
{"text":"The reason I liked it here was as a larger woman they had discount clothes that fit me. This is often a frustration at Bicester for me. I'm apparently too fat for some designers to want me to be seen in their clothes.


 I got my favourite sunglasses here - leopard print!


 If you are in Las Vegas for awhile and have a car, this is a great place to go. It's about $20 by cab from the strip though."}
{"text":"This is one of my Favorite places to shop beside the Mall. 150 designer and name-brand Shop around. But its an out door. The time to shop is Monday - Saturday 10am - 9pm and Sunday 10am - 8pm.

Every time my family is from out of town this is where I mainly take them. 
THE LAS VEGAS PREMIUM OUTLETS.

Sometime this outlet has great prices and sometime it dosen't . Just like every Outlets.

The store I mainly hit up are: J Crew, 2Bebe, Juicy, Coach (sometime if Hubby lets me. lol), AX Armani Exchange, O.C.C. (thats a make-up store), Nike because my hubby, Guess, Lacoste, Michael Kors, and Marciano. 

Other than that... There are many other store like Banana Republic, Levis, Perry Ellis (I think that a little over rated store), Gap, Jewerly store, Marc Ecko, Dolce & Gabbana, Dooney & Bourke, Ed Hardy, Elie Tahari, Kenneth Cole, Polo Ralph Lauren, Salvatore Ferragamo, St. John, Theory, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger and many more. 

Oh and of crouse there is a food court and for who ever LOVE coffee and need to wake up ... \"Starbucks Coffee\" YAY!!! LoL"}
{"text":"Wow. What a selection at the Adidas store at the factory outlet mall in Las Vegas. they have everything from sneakers too short to shirts Etc. I picked up some nice sandals couple of pairs of shorts in a couple of nice t-shirts for dirt cheap. highly recommend the Adidas store in the factory Premium Mall."}
{"text":"Big outlet. They've got a Fox store. And a decent food court too."}
{"text":"When ever I come to Vegas, I always end up coming here. I love the stores they have here and it seems like they keep adding better and better stores. They also have a coupon book for discounts if you have a AAA card. You can pick one up at the information desk and show them your card. If you do not have a card, I think you can purchase one for $5 or $10. My favorite stores are Puma, Armani, Marc Ecko, and Colombia. If you get hungry, they have an excellent sushi buffet there."}
{"text":"not to bad.. didn't buy much here. but a pair of 50 dollar last year model nikes.. i bought a reg price hat at o neils... and a slushie.. need more sales and bargain@!!! the cosmetic store was a laugh.. only a slight discount on lancome makeup.. and the rest was perfume.. lame..."}
{"text":"I have to say as far as outlet malls are concerned the North Premium Outlet in Las Vegas is definitely one of the best. The customer service alone is worth the trip over. It's easy to stay on \"the strip\" as a tourist. But I am glad I ventured off a bit to check out the outlet.

I would advise anyone coming to the outlet to get there a little early. It is definitely one of the busier outlets that I've seen. It is also an outdoor seating so getting out before the temperature heats up would be ideal.

One of the main perks of the mall is definitely the wide range of stores that are located within the facility. They range from the Gap, Carters, Nike, Hot Topic, Levi, Movado, Kate Spade, Burberry, Ferragamo, etc. So really something for everyone. And the discounts were amazing at almost every store from around 40% to 75% off.

So all in all definitely a must stop if you want to do any shopping while in Las Vegas while avoiding overpriced stores."}
{"text":"I love shopping here! The variety is great-however, the ability to get in and out is difficult. The parking is atrocious!! The pricing is fair, but keep in mind these are outlets, and most of the items are made for outlet and are not something you would find in the regular stores."}
{"text":"One of the newer outlet malls. Used to go to the one on the Luxor end but have been going to this one more often. Shops for the most part are the same with some stores here instead of there. Getting here & parking can be a bit more \"fun\". It is an outside mall so it can get hot, especially durIng the warmer months. So when I'm in LV, I make sure to stop by here."}
{"text":"Es un gran lugar para comprar primeras marcas a menor precio, PERO no todas las marcas bajan el precio regular demasiado as√≠ que hay que estar atento. Es tranquilo y al aire libre, lo que hace que la experiencia de comprar sea menos estresante. Muy recomendable!"}
{"text":"This mall is gross. Security always harassing people trying to park. Parking is a nightmare, hundreds of spaces roped off not accessible. Parking garage is a worse traffic nightmare than the highway during rush hour. They block employees from parking so they can't get to work. It seems the management of this mall discriminates and provides a hostile environment."}
{"text":"I have been to many different outlets in United States. Every time when I go to an outlets, I'll ask for the coupon book first. This guy in the information desk said I have to pay $10 for it, which is a totally surprise for me (who's being a VIP for seven years). So I asked what if I am a VIP, he said I can print it out online for free. I have no choice but purchased this coupon book. Then many other customers coming in, and I saw the guy asked one of them show their VIP on their cell phone. So many people one by one, get the coupon book for free, so I get online, and asked this guy a refund for the coupon book since I did nothing wrong. NO REFUND!!! and the guy said he can give me another coupon book for FREE!!! who needs two coupon books?WHO? WORST experience!"}
{"text":"I love shopping here ... it's much better than paying full price at the stores!  They have a great selection of stores from the moderate to pricier spectrum, and are opening up more soon (hello Kate Spade and Aldo shoes!).  You can also sign up online to be a VIP, and then get extra coupons that way. Who needs to shop at the Forum Shops anyway?"}
{"text":"iv'e been comming here for a long time it's always fun the things i don't like  is that you can't get a haircut and there is no book stores  but i always get good deals on clothes."}
{"text":"I read lots of reviews before boing to this outdoors mall. I am really not a fan of outdoors shopping, especially when the place is this big and you can't just take an elevator to the next floor where the shop you are looking for is location. However, since so many people wrote great things about this place, I decided to take the plunge and go shopping there with a friend. We wanted to go to 7 far all mankind. It's our bad that we parked the car near a popular brand store which was on the opposite side of where banana republic is. An this is why I don't like outdoor shopping! We had to go through the whole outlet to get to the stores we wanted check out. The good thing is that that there are a loto of place you can sit down and relax for a big, which is quite necessary on hot days. We also grabbed a coffee at starbucks, which was nice. But what really disappointed me was the huge line in kate spade and the not so good deals at the most shops we went in to. It is true we didn't go during sales season but I expected better deals on most of times. Will I visit again! Probably I will."}
{"text":"Good deals, make sure to check in and get free passport offer. Love shopping here every Vegas trips."}
{"text":"They had a HUGE sign outside about buying one pair and get the other pair (valued the same or more) at 50% off. So I bought some shoes I normally do. The boring black work shoe that's the same as the Doc Martin's. Apparently they changed their position that this shoe is now a \"work boot\" and does not qualify for the sale. Ok awesome."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of outlet malls as normally they are geared towards tourists and rarely do they have deals.

But this outdoor mall was recommended to us by a couple of local LV residents.  The day was warm and gorgeous so we said what the heck.

Tons of shops, all the big names and tons of deals.  My friend ended up buying quite a few things on sale, me not so much.  I just didn't need anything badly this time so I just mainly browsed.  I did buy some cute souvenirs from an outdoor stand but that's about it.

This mall has mostly clothing and perfume stores at good prices, not enough food or knick knacky things.
 
Very clean premises, modern construction, well kept.  Definitely a must for tourists.

I would come back if I needed some brand names at a deal, but probably not otherwise.  Time to see what other shopping areas Vegas has."}
{"text":"If you are a non-smoker or have children, do not even bother coming here.  This mall goes out of its way to ensure all smokers are well taken care of.  Walking between stores you will be engulfed in second hand smoke your entire shopping experience.  The most disgusting experience ever."}
{"text":"SO much cheaper than UK prices! Calvin Klein is a favourite of mine and I managed to get some Uggs for ¬£80!!


 Some shops are a bit rubbish and the food court isn't great, but it's not too far from the strip and it's air conditioned."}
{"text":"I went here during the summer.  The parking situation is terrible, not enough spaces for the amount of cars here.  It took 10 minutes to find a parking spot.  The food court is small and crowded, not enough selection of different foods.  The shops here are great, with alot to choose from for men and women.  The discounts in the stores are closer to 20% off the retail prices in the malls, not 50% to 75% from what I've heard.  The misters really help in the Las Vegas heat."}
{"text":"Der Outlet wird sicherlich niemals einen Sch√∂nheitswettbewerb gewinnen aber
Wer
 Las Vegas besucht oder dort Urlaub macht, sollte einen Abstecher dahin 
wagen. 
Auch mit dem Taxi ist der Preis von knapp 16EUR (22$) pro Fahrt noch zu 
verschmerzen. 
10min. Fahrt vom MGM Grand Ich war zur Haloween Zeit 
dort und hatte in fast allen Gesch√§ften Sale Aktionen (Buy1 get1 for free oder 3for2 usw.)
Einen Tag daf√ºr planen und Spa√ü haben beim shoppen."}
{"text":"Teilweise liegen die Preise √ºber den anderen Outlets in den USA. Man merkt also dass es eine ziemliche Touristen Mall ist."}
{"text":"Quiet amazing since this is the place where I finally FINALLY found a leather dress shoe that wasn't made in China.  This was a years-long effort to find a replacement to my worn Dockers dress shoe.  I was wiling to pay reasonable prices so while the Nordstroms of the world have shoes to my liking, they were well into the triple digits in price just because they weren't made in China.

I stepped into the Johnston & Murphy store just beaten from the heat and about to lose all hope, when I found THE shoe.  For $70 I walked out of there with a fantastically designed leather shoe made in Italy.  It was the proudest shopping moment of my recent life because I found a bargain AND stuck to my principles."}
{"text":"The gap here is my favorite one. They always have sales. Sometimes I find shirts for my toddler for less than $5. And they're really good quality. I've washed them numerous of times and they're still not faded."}
{"text":"Best mall in all of Las Vegas. Great variety of stores and awesome prices, be sure to arrive early morning to find parking."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  No greeting from the get go.  I was interested in a top that was hanging on a higher clothing face out. I grabbed one of the hanger sticks to get it down...still no one to assist or acknowledge me even there.  When I got the top down, someone finally came up to me and said \"ask next time\"... I was so disgusted by her manner, I lost all interest in what I was looking at and walked out. Horrible badly trained associates who lose money for their business. I'm sure that's the norm, and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The same as the south but further from my hotel (Cosmo) and outside in vegas heat. If you have time for only 1 Go south.

It has air conditioning."}
{"text":"If bargains are what you are after, head to this outlet centre to the north of the strip, in the direction of The Stratosphere Hotel. We had a car, so not sure if the bus goes here.


 Got some fantastic bargains from Armani Exchange, Guess and Ralph Lauren. Loads more besides. You should probably look at buying another bag to take it all home!"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally go shopping and I've heard that the North outlets were perfect for high-end stores at low prices. Although, when I got there, it's still pretty pricey for an outlet. I think the best deal there was Kate Spade. 50% off select purses and all wallets, some purses had an addition 20% along with the 50% already. Sadly, I didn't snatch the deal because I desperately needed new wardrobe more than new bags. 
I was surprised at the amount of shoe outlets they had, but still no good deals. The clothing outlets were okay, just the same old merchandise every time.
I'm giving this place 3 stars because it's just too much. You can easily get lost, especially with the construction going on. I kinda missed when the outlet was smaller.."}
{"text":"We were in town for the M.A.G.I.C show and we decided to do some shopping during our stay. I must say this mall is pretty big.. I didn't get to visit all the stores I wanted to, I was short on time..but during my visit here I did enjoy some of the stores i did come across. This outlet mall is pretty great, they have Joe's Jeans, Bare Escentuals, Nike Factory, Burberry, Juicy, Volcom, Hurley, just to name a few.. in a couple of stores their selections were nice.. compared to other outlet stores I've seen.. great prices.. it's a nice outdoor mall, its even nicer if you come out on a sunny day..it felt great to just hang around.. I can't wait to go back so I can do more shopping."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to rave about this place but to be honest I didn't see the appeal. Some things are cheap but I wouldn't say its any different to Cheshire Oaks in North West England - and certainly not half as big.


 Free parking though so worth a wander round"}
{"text":"Im Las Vegas Outlet North bin ich schon √∂fters zu g√ºnstigen Preisen f√ºndig geworden. K√ºrzlich habe ich wieder sehr sch√∂ne GUESS-Handtaschen f√ºr meine T√∂chter gefunden. Die jungen Damen schw√§rmen f√ºr GUESS, meiner Frau k√∂nnte ich damit nat√ºrlich nicht damit. Das PREMIUM habe ich oben weggelassen, weil es wie bereits verschiedene Vorredner angemerkt haben, eher irref√ºhrend ist. Aber f√ºr das breite Volk, das nicht nur Anz√ºge von BRIONI und Kost√ºme von CHANEL tr√§gt, bietet es schon das eine oder andere Schn√§ppchen."}
{"text":"this outlet is so huge that you need to have a day to spend here :) been to other factory outlet in other state but this is where you can get the lowest price... I nrought my friend from Singapore and she was so amazed of how cheap the bags and clothes are  she did a pretty good shopping here in Vegas"}
{"text":"Ein Muss!!!"}
{"text":"huge shopping center with absolutley anything you could want! there literally is every type of shop in there all at good prices!


 take a map though cause the place is soooooo big"}
{"text":"Far too many people and long lines both for counters and and fitting rooms. Try find other Premium Outlets for example near Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Awesome outlet center with plenty of higher end stores for you to spend your fresh Vegas winnings!  Selection is great and they're always updating the outlets to expand and upgrade.  Highly recommended if you're looking for a quick get away to spend some change."}
{"text":"Las Vegas ist sehr gut geeignet f√ºr das Shoppen :). Sehr viele Malls mit g√ºnstigen Angeboten. Die Vegas Premium Outlet ist schnell mit dem Auto erreicht, bietet gen√ºgend Parkpl√§tze und die √ºblichen Outlet Shops in einer Mall in den USA (GAP, Nike, Levis, ...)"}
{"text":"Parking was bad, way to far away!
The Prices were not cheap, it was to expensive. Don't waste your time.
I have been to a lot of outlets, but this was more a showroom than a outlet.
The Nike store had bad reductions to demonstrate it:
Nike Roshe orig Price 75.00$, outlet price 74.99$, it's not cheap....
Other clothes were also very overpriced.
Don't go, if you want to buy something for a good price."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I loved the stores at this outlet, they had good prices and lots of variety of stores..kind of something for everyone.

Why I gave it 2 stars though? Because I absolutely hated the Kiosk's they have there..they almost assault you trying to get you to \"try this\"  and \"try that\". And when you decline to have your hair done by some sleazy South American guy  with a hot hair wand they become hostile; and I mean that in every sense of the word; hostile. They become not only rude but down right mean..

It was so bad that we wanted to do another day at this outlet but after recounting the awful Kiosk people, we decided to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"El paraiso de las compras, todo barato y buenas marcas."}
{"text":"Wir waren im Premium Outlet North - in der N√§he vom Stratosphere. Spontan - bitte nicht lachen! - kam mir das Ganze √§hnlich vor wie Zweibr√ºcken; vor allem der schrottige Lauren Factory Outlet. Wie andere Qyper schon bemerkten: nicht zu vergleichen mit anderen Outlets in den USA in denen es wesentlich gediegener bei niedrigeren Preisen zugeht. Es war unser zweiter Besuch hier - den Outlet South hatten wir auch schon probiert. Sicher kann man den einen oder anderen Schnapp machen - aber wenn man gezielt nach hochwertigen Artikeln zu g√ºnstigen Preisen sucht (nicht nur die retournierte Ware vom letzten Jahr...), dann haben wir uns hier nicht richtig gef√ºhlt. Unsere pers√∂nliche Empfehlung: Concorde Mills Mall in Charlotte in North Carolina. Hier haben wir schon viele Male absolut gut eingekauft."}
{"text":"If you're going to ride the RTC bus, I would just catch a cab from the strip in the morning. The connecting bus will not start until 9 AM. The stores open at 8 AM.
I would also print out the map, or download one on my phone, and circle shops I would want to get to.  The design is pretty simple, but it may take awhile to figure out which way is north. 
We went to lunch around 11 to avoid the crowd, great idea. if not, we would have waited until about 2. 
It was over 100 degrees when we went in June. Bring a water. Better yet, go to Vegas in the winter."}
{"text":"Wir waren unter vielen Anderen auch in diesem Outletcenter und es hat die typischen L√§den, welche man auch in den anderen Outletcentern findet. Die Preise sind nat√ºrlich toll, die L√§den sind gut klimatisiert und shoppen hier schlaucht etwas mit der Zeit denn bei uns war es kalt, hei√ü und die im st√§ndigen wechsel. Aber es lohnst sich hier vorbei zu schauen."}
{"text":"Gro√üe Outlet Mall mit prima Angeboten. Die Mall besteht aus zwei Teilen. Wer g√ºnstig einkaufen will, f√ºr den ist dieses Einkaufscenter ein Muss. Nicht jeder Laden hat gute Angebote, aber die meisten. F√ºr Import nach Deutschland aber Rechnung f√ºr Zoll aufheben, sonst wird nach Originalpreis gerechnet."}
{"text":"I've been many outlets in CA but this place is in my top 5!
First of all, they have l'occitane outlet!!! Usually, I go the store and see their skincare products and just go. I can't buy because of the price!!!
but this place, maybe you can find something affordable!
I enjoyed Cosmetic Company Outlet,too!
they have stila,clinique,mac,bobbi brown and estee...it's luckey if you can find something, because they have only limited selection and color."}
{"text":"After a brief stay in Vegas, we decided to head on over to 4-star rated Premium Outlets. Oh my, oh my, oh my. 

Tips:

1. I implore you to get there before noon to shop or be prepared for carmageddon in the parking structure. 

2. The VIP coupon book available for purchase at the information booth: don't get it. It's really not worth your money considering you're NOT allowed to combine the sales within the coupon book with the deals already occurring in the store. And chances are, the ones in the store are better anyway. Unless you're planning on dropping hundreds for a Kate Spade handbag to get a 15% deal, not worth your $5. You can preview it if you'd like though.

3. If you manage to get there early with fewer people, the crazy packed stores include Polo Ralph Lauren and Banana Republic. The line for Banana was insanely long so I'd suggest you hit that store first if it's one of the stores on your list. 

Otherwise, this outlet was huge! We didn't even shop all of it because our feet were so dang tired already. The only downside to this outlet would be like sometimes it doesn't seem like an outlet at all because the prices are still the same for some stores. It was a hit or a miss, but even during this after Christmas setting, there were more misses than hits. 

4 stars for variety, aesthetics, and the fact that I got Nikes for $60 here and boots for only $20."}
{"text":"DAS ist ein Outlet!
Hier ist zwar die H√∂lle los, gef√ºht die H√§lfte aller Shopping-Victims sind Deutsche. Aber: Hier gibt es wirklich alles, und die Ware wird so schnell nachgef√ºllt, wie sie √ºber die Ladentheke wandert.
Die Preise sind die gleichen wie in den meisten Outlets, die Anzahl der Shops sowie die erstklassige Erreichbarkeit sind die gro√üen Pluspunkte.
Nat√ºrlich mach Shopping in den go√üen Malls am Strip mehr Freude, aber um den leeren Koffer bis zum Platzen zu f√ºllen, ist man hier genau richtig!"}
{"text":"Love coming here!  So many stores, all varieties.  Some places have great deals, others don't seem like an \"outlet.\"  Always stop here when I'm in Vegas to check out what the good deals are!!"}

{"text":"Parking is hazardous to your health. I would suggest going on the weekday but even then parking can still be a pain in the rear. Its worth it once you do land a spot because they have just about all kinds of stores high end to regular outlet stores such as GAP and quicksilver to Burberry and Coach. Great selection of things and I assure you will not leave empty handed!"}
{"text":"Excellnt shopping centre. Large range of designer shops such as ralph lauren, hugo boss, burberry, nike, french connection, juicey cotureand at a whole lot cheaper than in the UK. It is also cheaper than other desiger shops in vegas. would recommend to shop here. has a food court to eat at if you get hungry!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great!! Except the customer service guy threw a discount coupon book on me just because i shown him my AAA card to get free coupon book. What a bad day for me!!"}

{"text":"I love this mall. I took a $18 cab ride on Superbowl Sunday from my hotel on the strip to this mall. I really loved the Burberry  store. Wow! Huge! The Tory Burch had a nice shoe selection. I was shocked to see a Stuart Weitzman store. The selection was okay. The Michael Kors wasn't bad. The Nike store had a great selection of womens running shoes. I just wish I had gone here first instead of The Palazzo or Forum. Def a must see if you like to shop and really nice to walk around since the weather was nice. This mall is outside so go on a nice day."}
{"text":"Great shopping center and I found what I needed on a very good price."}
{"text":"Everything here is great,  from fashion items to services. All the stores I've been to the customer service has been great. Friendly service with a smile is awesome where ever you can find them. I even hear there's even a plan for a brand new parking area. If they could upgrade the food court then it would be awesome."}
{"text":"What a great place to spend a morning! I say morning because by afternoon, it gets pretty hot, since it's not shaded at all. Great variety of stores, loved Dolce & Gabbana, Kate Spade, Elie Tahari, Juicy, Salvatore Ferragamo, Lucky and Miss Sixty. The customer service at the Kate Spade Outlet deserves a special shout-out, way WAY  above what you normally find in an outlet setting. Burberry was a mess, merchandise all over the damn place, hard to find anything and prices were about the same as at the non-outlet location. Bleh. If it's an outlet, at least let me feel like I'm saving A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY, right?! I'm just grateful I didn't have my little princesses with me or I would have left a lot more money there! 
Not a bad cab ride from the strip, but a good thing happened when we were in the cab line waiting to leave; a limo driver, clearly thinking on his feet, gathered several of us going to the same hotel and took us back for less than the cab ride! Score! A much more comfortable ride! 
The one and only downfall was that I couldn't find any place that served alcohol!  I was just short of devastated, then I spotted the Dairy Queen.  Obviously not the same, but a smoothie really helped keep me going. I just enjoy shopping ever so much more with a cocktail in my hand! Now before you start thinking \"wow, Liz, you're such a drunk\", remember, I was on vacation, okay?!
I highly recommend this place for some less pricey shopping than you find on the strip."}

Attention aux tailles ! Le XL am√©ricain c'est du XXL chez nous et il vaut mieux essayer tout avant d'acheter (on peut, le personnel est super aimable).

{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype.  Sure you have lots of brand name and designer shops here, but the prices weren't  any better than you could find online, or during a standard sale at your favorite store.    

Parking was also a nightmare, and the food court was lacking.

The visit here was a total waste of time for us."}
{"text":"One of the spots I regularly visit every time I go to Vegas. Decent priced, clean and well spaced out. It gets crowded but I've never felt overwhelmed there."}
{"text":"This mall was nice as a regular mall even if it wasn't full of outlet stores.  Outdoor pedestrian malls always seem nicer than the indoor malls so this was a nice change for outlet shopping.
The store selection is varied and many higher end companies had stores here that aren't usually encountered at the more common Mills based malls.
Even if you aren't shopping, this is an interesting place to come visit and just sit outside and people watch. It's a good break from the strip and the timeless casinos."}
{"text":"Had a good time there. Had lots of my favorite stores but too much and too hot to do in one day.  Enjoy and take the Vegas Strip bus to get a tour of the city and save some money getting there."}
{"text":"Das Labelangebot ist sehr umfangreich, das Sortiment ist allerdings kleiner als z.B. in den Outlets in der N√§he von New York City oder denen im S√ºden von L.A.


 Etwas nervig waren die zahlreichen St√§nde au√üerhalb der Gesch√§fte wo man wie auf einer Messe alle 5m angesprochen wird ob man z.B. eine elektronische Zigarette testen m√∂chte und sie dann am besten f√ºr 150$ auch gleich kaufen soll.


 Die Food Corner sind super. Gro√ües Angebot z.B. China Max, Subway und Co. Auf der gegen√ºberliegenden Seite der Outletwelt, quer √ºber den Parkplatz ist ein super Smootie Laden. Der Name war irgendwas mit \"Tropicana\". Sehr gut!"}
{"text":"Nice stores! I love Calvin Klein and ASIC store. It's outdoor mall so bring your water bottle to cool down."}
{"text":"The TUMI store here provides the BEST service one can ever receive. The male assistant is very attentive to details, thoroughly explains the features of each product very well- exceeded my expectations. Fabulous! I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Love the Hanes store there, I get all my undies there. The prices are good and they always have sales. I'm a loyal customer as long they are open."}
{"text":"It's an outlet in the desert....what can I say It was hot....there is a parking structure next to the stores and it was packed did not have to wait to long for a spot.  Bring water and your walking shoes."}
{"text":"Shopping is my cardio!!!

I love to shop and when I'm in town to visit my brother and his girlfriend. I always make a point to stop at this outlet. 

They have more selection on the designers that I love and the deals are always there no matter what time of the year I'm there. My husband and I travel to LV at least 3 times a year. 

It does get hot during the summer as we all know which is the downfall of the outlet being out doors, but that never stops me from shopping here, just go right when they open :)"}
{"text":"Why do I love coming to Vegas?  

1) Gambling
2) FOOD
3) OUTLET Shopping!!!

Vegas Premium Outlets has the best outlet stores in the area.  It's not so huge where you feel overwhelmed with all of the ground you have to cover, but they do have a good variety of stores.  This is the best place to shop around, especially if you're looking for some great deals!  And it's only about 10 minutes from the strip, in downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"As a local I was not impressed with this place at all. I felt the prices were outrageous and the mall itself was way too hot for the middle of summer...I didn't notice any misters on when I was there over the summer. Also parking was an absolute nightmare...hubby and I went here around 2pm in the middle of the week and the garage was filled...took us 10 minutes to find a parking spot...never again"}
{"text":"Parking.  So the garage says 90 spaces open. Yet the \"guard\" there just leans back on his post and watches cars leave without letting anyone in.  I ask if we can go in. He says \" no, all full\"  Doesn't move. Doesn't look. Doesn't make for a great first impression."}
{"text":"Parking is impossible. They should Pay you to wait for a parking spot. The Mall management must be nuts! They tore down a parking lot to add more store, when one can't park Now! News flash: outlet sale items are crap, not the same quality as an item found in Dillard's or Macy's. The junk is made just for the outlet.  No sit down restaurant. Stick to the sales at a real shopping center."}
{"text":"Good place for shopping. A large number of stores but hard to park!"}
{"text":"Always find a good bargain.  The food court is nice too. Enjoy coming here to enjoy shopping and sunshine when i visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a must for the shopaholics that visit Las Vegas! This set of outlets boasts stores for every budget. I appreciate the range of brands carried by this place. You can find deals from your favorite mall stops to rare high-end outlet versions of brands like Juicy Couture or Stewart Weitzman. My favorite place to shop here is the French Connection store.

Don't get your hopes up too soon though, some of the stores don't offer discounted prices. Which makes me wonder why they are even at the outlet. But thankfully, these stores are rare. One other negative: parking can be a real chore.

Another tip: Holiday weekends boast really awesome sales (I mustered enough courage to brave the midnight madness sale on black friday), but be aware that you will need a lot of time and patience to deal with the large traffic of tourists and locals alike.

I wish you happy shopping!"}
{"text":"I love these outlets, it is nice but I wish it is enclosed because the elements can be brutal. FCUK, BR, Coach, Dolce, A/X and other outlets that are more higher end are located here. Too bad it lacked a lot of my sizes so I left a little disappointed."}
{"text":"The baby & I did our share during Black Friday to help stimulate the economy at this eye-popping paradise for bargain-hunting shopaholics.  Conveniently located less than 10 mins. away from The Strip, we arrived there before 9AM & took advantage of the extra discounts which, unfortunately, don't apply to all stores.  BONUS BARGAIN:  Try to get a hold of on-line coupons that you can present at the information desk to receive coupon books for added discounts.  Example:  Baby got a 20 percent discount at Lucky Brand Jeans.  Good quality stores like Bass, Coach, Ann Taylor & about 150 more.  From now on, we need not travel all the way to Primm, NV to go outlet shopping."}
{"text":"Visiting here reminded me why after spending high school and some college years working at an outlet center, I don't go to outlet centers. That being said, I do like the set up of this one. Nice looking storefronts and doesn't have a million stores all lined up waiting for your money. The outlet center on the south end of the strip is like a horror house of stores jumping out at you all at once. 

Great store choices, most very high end. As expected the stores that people can actually AFFORD are mobbed. See: Forever 21. The Coach store is spacious so there's less of chance your eyeballs will be scratched out for coming too close to someone's prized purse find. LESS of a chance. 

Parking is decent, big garages on both sides of the center. The food court is...a food court. Hope you like ear shattering noise as you eat. Keep in mind if it's 80 degrees in Vegas hoofing around this center will make it feel like 90. And if it's 90? You won't see me here. Know what else you won't see much of? Locals. It is tourist central...I would imagine you could hold some very successful foreign language immersion programs in one of the courtyards. But hey, it's an outlet center, all the negatives I mentioned you knew you were in for!"}
{"text":"Was dem einen Freud ist des anderen Leid. So empfinde ich es hier als sehr angenehm, dass diese Outlettmall, ausser die einzelnen Shops, nicht √ºberdacht ist und man zwischen den einzelnen Shops im Freien wandeln kann.


 Sehr angenehm dagegen, dass hier anstelle eines gro√üen Parkplatzes zwei Parkh√§user vorhanden sind. Somit stehen die Fahrzeuge √ºberdacht und im Schatten.


 Die einzelnen Marken die ich hier vermisse, finden sich dann im Las Vegas Outlet Center (http://www.qype.com/place/1827323-Las-Vegas-Outlet-Center-Las-Vegas) am Las Vegas Blvd. s√ºdlich des Flughafens."}
{"text":"At 10:30am on a Sunday I got a parking spot no problem. The deals really are good."}
{"text":"The stores had decent inventory, not the kind that are so outdated that no one wants to buy them, which is usually the case at outlets.  They just opened the Burberry and Juicy Couture stores, and the Coach store wasn't bad compared to my last experience.  After Christmas the store was at max. capacity that it felt like New Year's Eve on the strip.  Some sales lady had to carry a sign around so people would know where the end of the cashier line was.   My favorite was Banana Repub., everything was 40% off during 4th of July weekend :)"}
{"text":"Ein sehr gro√ües und recht neues Factory-Outlet in Norden von LV.


 Hier gibt es Shops wirklich aller interessanten Marken und meist fantastische Angebote, vor allem wenn man europ√§ische Preis gewohnt ist.


 Etwas ung√ºnstig ist, dass das Outlet sozusagen open air ist - was bei den dortigen Temperaturen etwas anstrengend ist. Wir hatten Gott sei dank nur 32¬∞, somit war es auszuhalten.


 Der Service ist anscheinend manchmal etwas genervt von den Touristenscharen."}
{"text":"This is like one of my homes. I go there atleast 3-4 times a week. Not really what you think of for an outlet mall. It's outdoors in the desert. Very hot during the summer, extremely cold during the winter.
They always got sales but they aren't cheap enough for an outlet. Fyi, the seasonal/holiday sales of most stores are the same sales they have on regular days as well. So doesn't really matter.
They have pretty decent stores that i always go to: Juicy Couture, Lacoste, Kenneth Cole, Steve Madden, Aldo, etc.
Parking garage is always full, so make sure to go there earlier of the day! This place is always busy...this place is most visited by tourists than the other outlet (South). Make sure to eat somewhere else before you get there, they sell overpriced food on the food court, which are not good enough to priced that much! Bottled waters cost over $2!"}
{"text":"Coach was having a sale this day. More than 50 percent off. Got my mom a great bag and purse."}

{"text":"I have yet to not spend money here.  They have very high end, low end, and everything in the middle shops.  I have the shops I always hit and the wife always hits her own shops.  If I'm doing well in the casino, I will try to splurge and get a nice gift for her.  Trust me, there are plenty of spots that she will love.

I usually frequent the spots that I can't find near LA like AG Jeans or True Religion Outlets.  Can't beat the prices and I don't need the latest styles.  Perfect for outlets.

If splurging for the wife, I hit Kate Spade or Burberry or Coach.  I can usually find something to buy.  She on the other hand doesn't like to splurge so she hits places like Banana or Ann Taylor.  Good deals all around.

Our latest trend has been shopping for baby clothes since we had a little one recently.  Carter's, Osh Kosh, Gymboree, and Children's Place are the spots to shop.  Seriously, they grow out of their clothes so fast, outlet shopping is perfect for them.  Brand new car smell without the brand new car prices.  You should shop these spots twice a year minimum to load up on the next size gear. (OMG their feet grow so fast...)

Like everybody else, if you're there for a leisurely shopping trip, go in the morning or evening.  It's hot and no cover available.  Going from 100 degree weather to A/C climate stores can't be good for you.  I don't know who they are trying to fool with those misters all over the place.  Those don't help unless you plant your face in front of one of them and hope that there's a breeze right after.

BUT, if you are a serious shopper and know what you want, go for the day trip.  Get there, hit your stores, and get out.  OR if you like the heat, hey, more power to you.  

Another thing, if it rains, again, no cover except for certain areas.  Outdoor malls are nice but not suitable for such extreme weather.

Buy buy buy.  The stateline stores suck except for William Sonoma and the Barstow shops are just a joke now, so stock up here while you still have money!"}
{"text":"If You want discounts on stores you've been to in other malls. The premium outlets is your best bet. I come here mostly for Puma jackets, children clothes at the children's place, and savings at charlotte. I'm Not into the outdoor thing and some store are too far from one another."}
{"text":"This pertains to the valet service at the outlet mall location. My car was broken into this past week. I was not informed about it until I went to go retrieve my vehicle. There were 15 thefts this past week in this outlet. That day my car got broken into there were 3 in the valet. The valet parking had my phone number and did not call me to inform me of the brake in. Also, I went to call the company  AmeriPark valet. Their numbers are not working. So shoppers be careful where you park and don't assume that your in valet that your vehicle and belongs are safe."}
{"text":"Poor service.. Walked in and the gurl n front turn around so she wouldn't greet.. WTF.. This place require no star"}
{"text":"Love these outlets, great selection and prices, not the normal last season stuff you find at other outlets. The stores selection is great, lacoste, D&G, Stuart Weisman, at an outlet mall thats awesome. Always end up buying several items from here."}
{"text":"I have only been to these outlets twice: once when I was a tourist and twice recently. It's still a nice place and has the type of stores that I would shop at. I like the layout and prefer this one to the South Premium Outlets although I have been there more often. I think the south one is where more of the locals go. You'll see mainly tourists at the northern one. So far, the customer service at the stores have been great. I'll have to visit this one more often."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than the outlet stores on the opposite end of the strip.

This outlet has outlet I have never seen before.  I have never seen an outlet for Ralph Lauren Children.  The prices were AMAZING for Polo clothes.  More than half off retail and everything is an additional 40% off THE LOWEST sticker price.  Even the clearance items.  I got my daughter a purple Ralph Lauren light weight zip up coat for $8.  I couldn't believe it.  I got her some dresses to for about the same price, maybe slightly cheaper.  They do have items that are more expensive but they are still a lot cheaper than buying them at Macys (even when they are on clearance).

Their Nike store is amazing.  We had went to the other outlet Nike store and bought a BUNCH of stuff.  When we entered this store, all the items we had already bought were CHEAPER here!!!  

Next time we are in town, this is the ONLY outlet I will be going to."}
{"text":"????????????????????????adidas???5??????????????2????????????????7??????????????puma?????15%????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????luxury beauty store????????????????????????????????????outler????????????????????"}
{"text":"I love malls, parking here sucks. Tried to get valet but I guess during the summer valet fills up real quick. The summer heat kept me in the stores more and made me walk into stores I wouldn't walk into because I was trying to run from the oven outside. Tons of stores and good prices!"}
{"text":"There's no way I can complete a trip to Vegas without stopping by here at least once during my stay. My aunt had told me that their high end stores had moved to their own area in this mall. That and plus the fact that it was my birthday gave me an even bigger reason to go. So glad I did! Being from the Bay Area, I love taking advantage of anywhere that has lower sales tax. The Coach store is my favorite. Normally I just get one item from there when I visit, but this time I managed to walk out with a leather wristlet and purse, each for under $100. What made it an even better experience is that I got handed a coupon for an extra 10% off as soon as I stepped in. Scoooooore! Happy birthday to me!"}
{"text":"Ich war besonders von dem Nike-Shop angetan !!! Besser w√§re aber NIKEHALLE  Irre Auswahl und Preise die jeden Schuh interressant machen. Man bekommt schon fur 25 Dollar echt coole Schuhe . Als wir nach zwei Stunden fertig mit probieren waren, zahlte ich f√ºr 4 Paar nigel nagel neue Nike gerade 170 US DOLLAR !!! Wer in Vegas ist und gern shoppen geht  Pflichttermin"}
{"text":"Szilvia at Hugo Boss is amazing. I rarely have seen sales person so friendly and enthusiastic. She did great and thus got a big sale. Thanks a lot!"}
{"text":"Take an Uber here immediately!

We were trying to kill time before out flight and the Mirage slots were not being kind to us so we headed here. I've found that it's completely more economical to pay $20 for a Hurley hoodie than to feed it to the machines... weird how that works.

The inventory offers items that you'd actually wear, not asymmetrical, sub-par, standard store rejects, these are things that are still in season, just heavily discounted. 

The bathroom facilities were clean and even though it was a very busy day, I didn't have to wait in line at all. There is also a food court so you don't have to gnaw your arm off for the fear of missing out on a good deal somewhere. 

There are some great brand name stores such as L'Occitane, Kate Spade, 7 for all mankind, Furla, timberland, guess, and more. I don't think I've even scratched the surface of what this outlet mall has to offer. We'll definitely have to return next time for a special shopping trip!"}
{"text":"Worst parking situation in the entire state of Nevada. We will never return after 45 minutes of driving around and not one single spot. Don't waste your time - just go to a place with a parking lot."}
{"text":"Love these outlets. They always have great sales going on. Best sale was Kate Spade. They had bags already lowered to a very low price plus still 70% off. I got a $325 bag for only $84 and an iPhone 7 plus case from $45 to $18. I always find great sales when I go to Las Vegas and especially at three outlets. If you go early in the morning before 12pm there are no crowds."}
{"text":"These outlets are better than the south premium outlet mall. It's outdoors so keep that in mind for summer, but the shops are higher end than the south outlet mall. There is Burberry, dolce and gabbana, Kate spade etc. Food options isn't that great but there is a Cheesecake Factory. 

By comparison, the south outlet (trust me I go there all the time cos I live nearby) also has nicer shops but aren't as high end. There is a coach, Michael kors but you can find all that and more in the north outlet anyway. The plus side is the south outlet is indoors (a little cramped and dark though in my opinion) and has more food options around the area. Both have great sales going on all the time. 

Either way I'd choose the north outlet if you want a nicer experience and the south outlet if you don't care if it's a little dingier and just want to shop."}
{"text":"I'm not a big shopper, but whenever I'm in Las Vegas with friend looking to shop I come here.
Parking can be quite a hassle on the weekends so listen to some good music and be patient.
There are plenty of stores from Reebok to Coach for all types of shoppers, even a Ed Hardy store..."}
{"text":"I'm glad I don't live in LV or I would be in debtttt majorly! I love this outlet.. I live in Washington and we have the same outlet but the prices/products are NOT the same!

I came here on the weekday  which thankfully, it wasn't super busy and swarming with people! The coach store is awesome, it's huge and has amazingggg deals! I got a super cute big leather tote for $120 or so... I had to seriously refrain myself from buying too much stuff in this store!

7 for all mankind. I probably spent close to a hour in here because their jeans were about $50 each. The shoes were on sale too but unfortunately, they didn't have my size. My bf bought a belt for $13 (originally $109). He seriously had to refrain himself from buying too many jeans! I couldn't believe how good the sale was in this store, as well!

I can't truly remember any other stores... Juicy was okay, the store was pretty enormous but the prices weren't that great. 

Overall, I would recommend this store and I definitely will shop here again if I visit LV."}
{"text":"I seriously save all my Christmas shopping until I can get to this outlet!  They have great stores and offer awesome discounts!  I love the layout and parking.  I do wish there were better food choices in the food court.  I am not a fan of the random places to eat.  Overall, great place to shop!"}
{"text":"Great prices here. I went to Pac Sun and got a couple of jeans for around $20 my sister snagged a pair for $10!

The Forever 21 here is closing, moved to the Strip I guess.

Hollister, American Eagle, Sunglass Hat, Juicy Couture, Nike, Addidas, the list goes on..."}
{"text":"This could be heaven on earth, but it's not quite there. You can definetly find some good deals here, but any amazing deals are harder to come by. I recommend going early in the day, and check their website before going for any extra deals going on. They also have free coupon books for MasterCard holders.

I didn't really find alot compared to the time spent here. The best stores were Nike, Brooks Brothers and Ralph Lauren. Some of the stores felt a little bit meh, especially compared to the brands usual stores. Ended up having to leave Kate Spade before I could try a dress, because they only had one dressing room and it was obviously a very popular store. 

I would definetly come back the next time, but without all the wandering around, so definetly have a plan before you go!"}
{"text":"These are pretty good outlets.  There's a large range of stores for if you want to spend some money to if you WANT TO SPEND SOME MONEY!!!

Most of the stores have decent deals and some of the stores have amazing deals.  

There's Nike, Adidas for those sporting days.  Diesel, 7 For All Mankind and True Religion for those hanging out days.  Burberry, Dolce and Gabana and Hugo Boss for those nights you want to go out.  Of course there are a lot more stores and more than just clothing stores.

There is a hot dog place in here that you should try the pretzel dog.  It's pretty damn delicious!"}
{"text":"Had  VIP coupon book thumbs up to Kate Spade store they honor the coupon even after extra 40% off but coupon not work at Michael Kors  store"}
{"text":"Avoid this mall at all costs right now. They are undergoing construction with only one entrance and one exit and we should have known when first going in to park that it was going to be hell getting out. And no one here seems to care that hundreds of cars are stuck in a parking garage standstill traffic jam wasting precious time in Vegas. Took us over an hour to get out of the parking lot and caused us to miss the rest of our plans in Vegas afterwards. Prices aren't that cheap either - better prices in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Great outlet here in Vegas! Much more stores than the other one.  It's an outdoor outlet so be prepared to be in the super HOT sun during the summer time.  Eeek!!! At least they have the water mist thingy on during this time.  It's a nice mall.  Great for walking.  You have everything from The Disney Store, Armani, Coach (my fav ^_^), Zales, Sketchers, a lot of surf brand shops like Quiksilver, Rip Curl & Billabong.  A whole lot to mention.  The only thing I don't like about this outlet is their food court.  Not that many selections & it ain't all that great either.  To me anyway.  Restrooms are hard to find other that the one in the food court.  It's always a busy mall because it's a tourist attraction as well.  So if you're in Vegas, don't forget to stop by here! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not a bad outlet, but not my favorite either. We had some time to kill, and that's all this ended up being: a time-sink. Parking is difficult to find, especially during peak hours. I don't see a whole lot of variety in the stores, and there wasn't a lot that appealed to me. I've seen better outlets."}
{"text":"We were in town for work and decided to take some time to hit up the outlets! Saw on Yelp that this one was more popular and took a taxi over there since it isn't that far from the strip. This outlet has most of the popular brand name stores and there were tons of awesome deals! I ended up buying more than I intended :x"}
{"text":"Beware!!  There is a kiosk near the Michael Kors Store that sells t-shirts.   I asked the price of a novelty tee.  Sales rep responded:  \"Starts at $20\".  I agreed, when he added iron-on to cheap $4 Gildan t-shirt, the price went to $54!!   I said \"No Way!\", and the sales girl chased me down causing a scene that I needed to pay for it..   It's a scam, poor customer service."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to stopping here before taking off back home to Cali but it was just ok. The sales weren't all that great and the only place that was worth going to was Coach but honestly Coach is just so played out I left empty handed. Went to Michael Kors expecting to come out with at least something but they were almost close to the original price. Same with the CCO was looking forward to picking up some Mac cosmetics but the makeup wasn't anything too appealing. What a waste of time never coming here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"One thing I've recently noticed is how polarizing the local malls are.

Meadows: Reasonably priced and accessible, but rather average and is slowly but surely losing the allure it once had.
Boulevard: Good selection in the stores that are available, but it seems like every other time I visit another store has closed or is going out of business and it has pretty much COMPLETELY lost it's allure.
Fashion Show: Great, diverse range of stores, but uppity and filled with too. many. TOURISTS.
Forum Shops: Accessible for a mall of it's kind, but gimmicky.
Grand Canal Shoppes/Palazzo: Very nice, but overtly-gimmicky and borderline inaccessible. 
Miracle Mile: Has a sense of fun to it, but trying too hard to be edgy.
Crystals: Looks pretty, but is mostly filled with a bunch of stuff we've already seen before. 
Outlet Center: Great deals, but kind of stale, if that makes sense.
Galleria: Seems appealing, but way too far from me to begin with so why bother?

The Premium Outlets is pretty much the only local mall which has no serious drawback to speak of in my opinion. True, it's outdoor, which will be a bitch in the summer months but it's a price I'm more than willing to pay. It's essentially a combination of all the pros of each of the malls I've already listed with none of the cons that make me groan in the back of my mind as I walk through the halls of each one.

Protip: The deals are very good, but remember to be careful. Pay very close attention as some of the stores are either priced exactly the same (or in some cases, actually charge MORE) because they believe that since it's an outlet mall it MUST be discounted, right? And it works, judging from the patrons I've seen in the stores who are guilty of this and seem to be completely blind to the fact that they're not getting a very good deal at all. 

The mall itself is a very interesting environment. It really reminds me of San Diego. The layout IS confusing but there are several courts, each of which with a large anchor outlet store and a marker of some sort, keep that in mind and you'll get the hang of it."}
{"text":"Came to this outlet while vacationing with my husband. We stopped by the customer service desk right away to pick up my discount card (with tripe AAA) for additional discounts for the majority of stores here. 

I like this outlet over the South outlet because there are more stores (well only 10 more though) and the place just seems bigger overall. One thing I wished was that it wasn't outdoors (well especially during cold or rainy weather). There are also plenty of shops here for me to browse through and spend my money at.

Plenty of parking as well at this location, will come back here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Outlets located within 5mi. from the strip where you can buy at moderate prices, I shopped at the nike, kenneth cole, baby gap, stores could of shopped more but it was just too hot, its an open outlet mall."}
{"text":"This place has some really rare outlet stores...at least coming from Atlanta they're rare to me. Diesel, Dolce&Gabbana, and American Apparel to name a few. GO NOW if you want to find some of the most ridiculous sales you'll ever see. Every store, and I mean every store, had a minimum 50% sale going. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't find a whole lot that I either liked/fit me.

Definitely worth a visit when in the city. About 10 minutes north of the strip. Easy to find and parking is free."}
{"text":"This outlet is good. It might not be the biggest outlet I have been to but the stores lineup is excellent. 7 For All Mankind, Armani Exchange, Guess by Marciano, Juicy Couture, Kate Spade and Diesel all in one place! 

My only complaint - it is an outdoor mall and the scotching dessert sun could be rather annoying. 

Unlike other outlets, this mall is located not too far from downtown. It is a short taxi ride from the center of the strip."}
{"text":"We went to the Premium outlets on an extremely hot Vegas day and we did not realize that this center was outside so we didn't go through every store like we normally would. We had our eyes on certain stores and visited them only because it was just so hot. There are misters everywhere and lots of seatings throughout, but it is still hot out there! Parking is in the structure, but it could be hard to find so just keep looking at the ceiling for the green lights to park!"}
{"text":"This place charges non-Nevada residents $5 for parking now.  This is just another tax grab, IMO.  Why impose this burden on shoppers?  Why not just take it from the businesses?  While I know that $5 is not a large sum, I just hate it when a business nickels and dimes its customers.  No more coming to this outlet for me."}
{"text":"This is a great outlet mall with all of the high end outlet stores. A few of my favorite are Michael Kors, Coach, Tory Burch, Juicy, and so many more. It is so large though that you can get lost. We walked around in circles a few times today trying to find the Coach store, lol. Not very good when it's 105 degrees outside. That's the only downside. It is an outside mall so it's hard to handle in the hot summer days. They do have misters that feel pretty good and cool you off for a second. 

The food court is pretty lousy as well. Not a whole lot of choices and seating is minimum. Every time I go there we have to wait for someone to get up. 

Overall a great mall with an awesome selection of outlet stores. It's better to go in the nice spring days though rather than the hot summer."}
{"text":"Hmm $10 coupon book? I thought Woodbury NY (also operated by Simon) offers $5 coupon book... Is it trying to rip off uninitiated tourists? I could've sold my coupon book (free via a Yelp check in) to a tourist for $5... 
I went on a Tuesday PM to kill time before my evening flight. 60% of visitors were Chinese tourists. 
Maybe it's because it was a weekday, but not much was on sale. For example, the Nike store had 6-pack socks for 25% off of $20. I could swear that my Nike outlet in NY sells it for ~$10 before discounts. 
I think it has become a tourist trap because tourists felt the urge to spend tons of $, which leads to stores jacking up prices/limiting discounts."}
{"text":"great mall, stores with wonderful discounts"}
{"text":"Tory Burch Outlet...

that makes it worth the trip.  Lots of other stores for those not interested in that brand.  The parking is kind of tight and usually pretty packed.  There are two PEV charging stations if you have that type of vehicle, however I have never been able to get them to work with my card."}
{"text":"Richtig gut. Richtig, richtig gut! Schn√§ppchenj√§ger und Shoppingqueens d√ºrften sich hier wohl f√ºhlen: 30-70% reduzierte Preise und eine √ºberraschend gute Auswahl an Marken. Besser geht¬¥s kaum!

Neben den √ºblichen Verd√§chtigen wie Sunglass Hut, Adidas, Nike und Levis, gibt es auch Fashion Brands wie Diesel, Aldo, Vince, Burberry und, und, und. Ich habe es in zweieinhalb Stunden nicht mal durch die H√§lfte der L√§den geschafft und hatte bereits so viele T√ºten, dass ich kaum mehr h√§tte tragen k√∂nnen. Zu meinen Troph√§en geh√∂ren unter anderem schwarze Lack-Nike Air Max, ein Burberry Mantel, eine Seidenbluse, eine Miu Miu Sonnenbrille und eine perfekt sitzende Camouflage R√∂hrenjeans von Lucky Brand. Diese musste leider wenige Tage sp√§ter, bei meinem Unfall zerschnitten werden... Ich trauere immer noch!

Tipp: Am Eingang kann man f√ºr 5$ ein Discount-Heft kaufen. Damit gibt¬¥s in vielen L√§den noch mal extra Prozente obendrauf. Das lohnt sich!"}
{"text":"I love Shopping and this is the place to go! you find good bargains all the time. I can spend hours in just one store. I find that the items here are very new usually compared to the other outlets i've been to. You find things that you find in regular retail stores all the time."}
{"text":"I like this mall. I got a really good deal at Neiman Marcus. I never imagined I could afford anything from that store but I got a nice top for a good price. Go early or finding parking may be tough. Would be better if it was indoors but hey, the outlet malls in Minnesota are outdoor and people still shop in the winter so who am I to complain."}
{"text":"Good outlet stores.  I am not sure the prices reflected outlet.   A lot of foreign travelers however thought it was a gem.  Beware that it can be hot outside walking.   Also food court is small and not great choices."}
{"text":"Came here and lets just say they aren't any different than the other outlet store around besides the fact that they really aren't much cheaper than the regular stores on the strip or elsewhere as we found out.   And some of the layouts in the stores was juat to crazy to deal with especially in shoe stores, juat a heads up if you do go here get here when it first opens up aftrr 12 it's gets packed and crazy"}
{"text":"I normally don't like shopping it's exhausting especially outlets cause it's huge and outside and bleeeh. However! This is a must stop when in Vegas now I don't know what's in the South side outlets but everyone said don't go I said alright and it's fine every store that I wanted to visit was in the North side! From Nike to Adidas and a Lulu Lemon that's right Lulu Lemon!! It's huge so wear comfy shoes. And lots of money because you'll always end up finding something I did... and a little too much on my most recent trip"}
{"text":"This is the best outlet mall in Vegas. Similar to the Cabazon outlets in CA."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE DEVIL.

Omg, I love it. The selection of stores is beautiful - Burberry, Cole Haan, and Kate Spade in one place?! YES PLEASE!

I can't speak for the parking issue because we took a cab there and back. No need to worry about parking that way!

We got there when they opened on Sunday for two reasons - we wanted to avoid as many crowds as possible, and we didn't want it to be blazing freaking hot.

We only spent a couple of hours there - we had specific stores we wanted to go to. I ended up with a new Kate Spade purse and wallet, and a new Cole Haan purse and wristlet, for under $330. I'd say I did pretty well."}
{"text":"I would give this place No stars. Do not go eat at the food court at the mall. It is disgusting and they have birds and insects that fly all around in the food court. There is bird poop on the tables and the janitors don't clean it up! Please stay away from this place. They allow birds and animals to live inside the food court!"}
{"text":"My wife loved this! I understand people complaining about it not being that cheap when you compare it to other outlet malls but for tourists it IS cheap. esp. when you compare it to european stores or some of the flagship stores around the US. We did shopping at Adidas, ecko unltd, hot topic, nike and some more stores, all with a great selection of goods (only exception here was nike, where we found absolutely nothing) and helpfull staff."}
{"text":"Coming here once was enough. Would have rated this 3.5, but I'll give it a 4.

If you want to take a break from the strip and ride the WAX or SDX somewhere safe to do some shopping, then this place is it.

This outdoor complex is very nice and clean, and a lot of the employees there are quite friendly. The coupon book, however, isn't impressive since they require you to spend a lot in order to get a discount. 

You'll definitely find at least one store to check out and see what they have on sale. They also have a Starbucks there as well, which accepts gift cards.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is okay if you're a tourist, but I'm not. The parking sucks on the weekend. Stay away if you live here. They have some good shops but I'm not a big fan of crowd. The food court sucks, need more restaurants or fast food place there. I wouldn't go back. Why go there when you can enjoy the coolness of the South Premium (indoor) Outlet. There are way more places to eat there and better shops."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

LOTS OF SALES!! I've been here twice in the last two times I've been in Las Vegas! Absolutely love how the tax rate is lower than the one in California. So many stores to go into and it'll probably take a whole day if I didn't restrain myself and reminded myself that I'm not here in Vegas solely to shop! Definitely go early for better things!"}
{"text":"Great place. Perfect for the ladies after a buffet or large meal. I found some great deals such as Lucky Jeans for 20 bucks a piece. Coach purses for an average of 150. Aerosole shoes for around 30. This is a true outlet mall. My wife and I spent 600 here and we prolly saved about the same. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"one of the nicest outlets in Las Vegas.  pretty good deals, except it was 110 degrees outside.  some of those mister don't even reach you, then again I'm only 5'2 1/4, yes i had to factor that in lol.  i went to leather store, my leather jacket was originally $150, i got it for $42, what a deal!!  expect to wait in line for some Starbucks approx 30-45mins, bummer.  o yea, so i lost my shoes in the whole room transfer deal, so i bought a pair of converse for $20, it made my day!! :)   definitely check out this place if you don't mind walking in the sun LOL."}
{"text":"Every time we visited Vegas, we ended up here every freaking time for whatever reasons, and we ended up turning the trip into a shopping spree here.  I actually started shopping here when the parking garage did not even exist many years ago.  It was amazing to see them adding a new section and built two parking garage, and expanded one of them lately.  Despite the parking nightmare, they added these ceiling lights telling you if a parking is available, so you do not end up circling on one floor forever in busy parking lot traffic.  They have bus route from the strip to here if you wish to save the pain.

If you walkthrough this place and did not end up buying one thing, then you really suck at shopping.  Something will always get you...  Whether it was Nike for shoes, clothes from Gaps to the Armani, purses from Coach, wallets, kids' stuff from Carters or Disney store, other designer brand stores, or maybe just Starbuck in the food court area and they accept Starbuck gift cards.

The Vegas North Premium Outlet is definitely one of my favorite places to spend those gambling wins.  Often enough, I found the same item cost a lot less here if they were sold in the same store on Strip."}
{"text":"Decent outlet mall with mostly higher-end options. Location is under construction so some businesses are closed and parts of the parking lot are a bit of a disaster, recommend using the garage.

Despite the brand-name stores (Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Ann Taylor, etc), the mall itself is on the run-down side and not in the best area of town, either. Expect to run into a lot of foreign shoppers who are nearly rabid and salivating over the sale prices, with no courtesy- cutting you off, snatching up things you're looking at, etc. If you don't want to deal with that, maybe go elsewhere.

Lots of sales here, being that it's an outlet but definitely make sure you're getting a good deal before buying- many of the locations have minimal markdowns, while others have 20 on top of 50% deals regularly. Just shop wisely and make sure to inspect condition of items before purchase, many places have small-print all-sales-final policies."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent and is a big area which I like. But one thing I don't like is that it feels incomplete for as big as it is. It does not have a forever 21 which sucks. I like that it has an accessible food court with a wide selection. It also has bose store which was helpful when looking for speakers as many malls and outlets don't have this store. In the summer I wish there was more mist because it gets very hot. And likewise for the winter as they need more heaters since it can get freezing sometimes. It's worth stopping by though if you are looking for good deals."}
{"text":"Freakin great outlet mall.  This is my 3rd visit, the last one being a few years ago where there were fewer stores.   I say forget Barstow and maximize your precious shopping time here.  I scored at the Crocs outlet for the first time.  (see my other review for Crocs outlet) 
I usually hit Brooks Brothers, Banana and Ann Taylor for work clothes.  Hey, you can always validate the male members of your Vegas entourage that shopping here is a great way to thwart any tempation to gamble (aka lose), thus saving them more money! LOL!"}
{"text":"Even though I have never gone to that mall before, I have applied for a job at Chipotle, twice and first, even though I had to reschedule a job interview, since I was in West Sacramento atm, then they lied to me about my would-be-upcoming job interview .

\"Thanks for applying to our Restaurant Team Member - Crew (2584 - Las Vegas North Outlets) position.  Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you a position at this time,\" they said.

Then, last month, when I was checking my emails, I got a chance to reapply for a job there and when I learned that I would have a job interview on Janurary 2nd, so on a week before New Year's Eve, I called them and attempted to reschedule the interview, to which I had to give them my phone number, and then they said that they would call me back later, but the next day, it turned out that they never called back after all, so on New Year's Eve, I managed to reschedulethe interview to this Friday and yet today (which is three days later, I think) I've just learned that they sent me the same message that I have already mentioned above. What a bunch of liars they really are! If you ever apply for a job, beware, people! Those people working there are liars! I'm sure there are better Chipotles out there and as far as I'm concerned, I don't think I'll ever apply for a job there again."}
{"text":"I love this mall but they started to charge $5 for parking - effective March 27/18. Locals with a DL are free but not the rest of us (I'm here twice a month). South Outlets are still free. Guess I'm going there."}
{"text":"There really are some great stores in this location with great prices!  There are several that I stop in several times a year as a local.  

The walkways and facilities seem to always be pretty clean when I'm there. It's also great that there are multiple parking garages/areas considering these shops get high traffic volumes. 

These shops are a great addition to the Downtown LV area, and I hope they stay well maintained for many years to come.  I enjoy that this mall is safe, affordable, and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Vegas. I walked away with a lot of great items. I made a purchase at Micheal Kors, Nike, vitamin store, and Gap Factory. Very nice outlet mall. I have been to vegas about 5x and my recent visit was my first time there. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This mall has the best selection in all of Las Vegas, and includes the best brands.  If you shop early in the day 9-11am you will find parking and no crowds whatsoever.  Keep in mind while it has outlet in the name... That does not mean it is heavily discounted or last seasons odds and ends.  So make sure you ask what is \"made for outlet\" and what is from the mainline retail stores.  Unfortunately most of what you will find is \"made for outlet\" product lines.  There are still some stores that carry current season items just at a discount so don't be afraid to ask.  

Bring snacks, there is not much for food here, and food court lines can be long.  Bring an umbrella in the heat of summer as there is no shade.

As a local in Las Vegas I don't shop here often as it has the worst parking in town and any prospective savings can be lost in the cab ride to the center for quick trips.  If you are not trying to park you have no worries, but on both weekdays and weekends I have encountered closed parking garages.  Hopefully there is a plan to increase parking as the center is huge and hiking from the main South garage to Cheesecake Factory in the summer heat is a hike and quite miserable.  

This review could easily be a 5 if there was parking, and shade, and an improved food court.  But it's just a great outlet store selection (J. Crew, Tag Heuer, Citizen, Dolce and Gabbana) that keeps us coming back.  But do shop early if you want a place to park."}
{"text":"First time at this outlet mall. Everything was at great prices. Loved the outdoor part of the mall. Great brands, good variety and also a good food court. Don't get the overstuffed lobster roll at the little wagon. Overpriced and definitely not worth $20."}
{"text":"The Oakley store helped me out tremendously and the staff was very very helpful and informative and very friendly they went out of their way to help me in a big way.. thank you Oakley"}
{"text":"This is a really cool outlet. Too bad it's so damn far from everything else on the Strip."}
{"text":"My friends and me visiting from out of town caught an Uber to the outlets. Was looking for a few things and I let the quest begin.

The outlet is nice, but really no different than other premium outlets that I've been to. You have your pick of many different stores. It's a good chance you'll find something you want for a good, discounted price. 

My favorite outlet there was the Cole Haan store. Polo always has great stuff. Nike, Sunglasse Hut, etc. Lots of great deals."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing special about the Las Vegas Premium outlets...and I say that because we have the exact same set-up here in Houston!!! The shops are the same, the layout is the same, and there is the same sense of boredom that comes across me everytime I walk through an outlet.

I have never found anything at an outlet that blows me away in terms of price...especially since there are so many great sales everywhere now!!!"}
{"text":"This mall is disgusting.  There is not a single open space that is not covered in people blowing their second hand smoke all over the damn place.  No thank you.  Never returning."}
{"text":"I love this outlet , done lots of my cross boarder shopping here while in Vegas. This outlet has it all with good deals. Just not crazy anout the pushy sales people working the outside stands."}
{"text":"Well.....im really kinda partial of this whole place...the only issue i have is when i think of an outlet mall i think of crazy prices and amazing deals.....LOL.....right well this outlet mall definitely does not match this criteria...and to be honest they match strip prices on some of the good the store sells....."}
{"text":"By far my favorite outlet that I have been too! The prices here are deeply discounted compared to the one on Primm, Cabazon, etc. The only bad thing about this place is that the parking is ridiculous! You would be lucky to find a spot here! We circled around like 3 times! And remember that it is packed already so time wise...very long!

The shops that are here that I like are the following:
1. Coach (Need to improve their designs...)
2. Lucky Brand Jeans
3. Burberry
4. Nike (Love their shoes!)
5. Banana Republic
6. Steve Madden (Brand new!!! Great selection!)
7. CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHERS! =(

Overall, DEFINITELY COME HERE!"}
{"text":"We drove to Both parking garages and saw the same signs ... $5 Parking. We turned around and went somewhere else. I will NOT pay $5 to shop at your mall ... RIDICULOUS ! ! !"}
{"text":"Good outlet mall with plenty of stores to select from and the stores are well stocked."}
{"text":"The mall itself has some great stores that you won't find very often around like Uggs but try not to go during the weekend as it is a large tourist spot. It gets very hot since it's all outdoors during summer and winter you'll get really cold so dress appropriately!"}
{"text":"In my experience, the north outlets are just ok.  Most of my visits here are short because I know which stores I want to shop in.  It's always busy just like any other outlet mall.  

There is construction going on throughout the walkways and storefronts.  It doesn't make for spacious walks with orange barriers all around.  Just very cramped.  Many of their palms were cut down and not eye appealing. 

On the plus side, they have some great stores here such as Kate Spade, Michael Kors and Burberry.  It's also filled with your staple outlet stores like Nike and Disney.  

When I know what I want, I'm not opposed to shopping here."}
{"text":"This is my Favorite mall ! Because they have the most stores ! It may be 101 degrees out here but I don't care ! More reason to go into every store and cool off ! LOL 
You have to hunt for good deals. It say's outlet. But it's not outlet prices."}
{"text":"I think this Outlet is either hit or miss.  The day we went, it was definitely a miss because I saw no eye popping deals. 

What I did see was the following:

* Plenty of vendors at the kiosks selling crap.  Why in the hell do I need a ball, made of slime, that you throw against a window just to watch it creep down the window?  Yeah, I bought 3.
* A Nike outlet store where it was wall to wall people yet no deals to be found.
* Briefcases in excess of $300 dollars.  I'm not going to live in the damn thing, I just want to lug some crap around.
* A food court with maybe 6 types of food choices and about the same number of seating available.  Ok, it was a large dining are but so packed that there wasn't seating available either indoors or out.
* More footwear stores than I ever knew existed.  Are Ugg's really a hot commodity in Vegas in May?
* A Levi's outlet store.  I like my Levi's but aren't denim jackets a bit much unless your herding cattle?
* A Guess outlet and a Guess by Marciano.  Well guess what....I don't know who Marciano is.

My observations withstanding, this mall is easy to get to and if you get there early, parking is quite easy to find inside the parking garage.  Later in the day it gets busy and parking seems to be a premium at either of the parking garages.

The layout is easy to navigate with a bank of stores on the perimeter along with a center building with additional stores so you're basically walking around a rectangle.  Plenty of water misters throughout for those hot Vegas days which made this shopping experience bearable."}
{"text":"This one is way better than the south outlet.  This is open air shopping center with a lot of high end brands.  Ted Baker, Burberry, 7 For All Mankind, etc. I wish I was in Las Vegas for Black Friday.  This is one of the first places I'd stop by.  I usually do my best to come here when coming to Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love this outlet. They are many brands you can shop here plus a cheese cake factory restaurant. Their parking is good also since there are several parking in mall. They sell a discount notebook too but you can get it free with your AAA card membership; sweet :)"}
{"text":"Outlets?!? 70% off sale??? Cheap designer brands? I'm SO there! Great selection of stores. From Michael Kors to Banana Republic. You can find alot of different stores here for anyone. The prices are remarkable as they are outlets. Only thing is try to avoid them during the 104 degree weather. Gets hard to focus on shopping, but then again, you can just hop around the stores and make use of the AC. There is also a taxi line, as there is everywhere else. Makes it easier for out of towners to enjoy."}
{"text":"As I journeyed thru the outlets, I found a great pet accessory kiosk, adjacent to the Van's shoe store, called Pets on display. Although the merchandise is basic with the bedazzled collars with matching leashes, and harnesses already sold at local pet stores, Robert Ansara served me well. His fashion forward sense and caring personality sold the deal. Got my Cookie her first dog tags, inspired by Tiffany ID bracelet. Thought it was a great buy $70 bucks for sterling silver dog tags with matching lady's bracelet. 

My Cookie girl is all smiles. No buyer's remorse here."}
{"text":"The parking at this place is just terrible. Despite having two lots, \"A\" and \"B\", there's no indicator on the outside of how many spots are remaining. One could end up driving to the roof and then back out again before even seeing a spot. Yes, they have those new red/green indicator lights if there's a spot, but the staff is limited to putting up an orange cone at the parking lot entrance when they think it is filled. While it is not the biggest outlet, it has one of the better selections of high-end brands, security runs around on Segways. If you fail/give-up finding parking, there's a small, paid lot for $7! (Damn, MGM for starting this trend in Vegas!) Another pro-tip is to buy the City's Deuce pass and it will go from Strip all the way to here. You skip the taxi line, the madness of finding parking, but then you can only take what you hand-carry back."}
{"text":"There is a good selection of stores to visit and the prices are actually pretty good. Also, if you have AAA membership, you can get a coupon book from the information office. Just be careful to look at the fine print for exclusions.

Overall, I try to stop here for at least a little shopping when I'm in Vegas. There are usually some pretty good deals. And it's not far from the strip either.

A couple of notes though (that have not deterred me from coming)- it's an outdoor mall so of course it gets quite hot in the summer. Parking is also a pain. There are always tons of cars trying to get in and out.

Other than that, it's worth a visit. Why pay full price when you can get things for less?"}
{"text":"Great parking, great stores, great prices, this is my favorite outlet shopping center!"}
{"text":"This is a great outlet mall, but you might find some better bargains at their south Outlet Mall on south Las Vegas Boulevard. There were two distinct items that were cheaper down south. One was a phone belt holster that was three dollars less. The other was a jacket that was BOGO 1/2 price up north, but the item itself was 1/2 off down south. Yes, these were both at the same store, same style, etc. The north outlet mall is bigger and has more stores. The one down south is older, slightly smaller selection of stores, but you might get a better bargain."}
{"text":"This place rocks now, I used to hate it. My wife just found out they are charging for parking now and that's like the best news ever. Every time I come to town (Every 3 months) I have to stop at this stupid mall. Now shes so mad at them for charging for parking that she wont go anymore. Can you hear the joy in my post? She was complaining and I was singing inside. Thanks guys, I never thought the mall itself would get me out of this."}
{"text":"This place was amazing...Not for what it looks like, but for what you can find. I made a last minute decision to go and I'm so glad I did! A must-stop for every gay man visiting Vegas. D&G, Diesel, French Connection, Calvin Klein, Energie, Ted Baker... Are you serious? I can't believe I almost missed this place. Definitely worth the $20 cab fare from the strip. I just got my entire summer wardrobe and probably saved $1,000.00 off the full prices. Most of the stores I went to had deals going on offering 20-50% off of everything inside (with a few exclusions like formal wear). There's good stuff too...you just have to have the patience to sort through all the ugly stuff and XXL crap."}
{"text":"Of all the Premium Outlets, this is probably one of the most extensive ones I've been to.  It has all the usual stores but also a lot of the more high-end stuff that I don't see at all outlets: Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Michael Korrs, etc.  I actually found a lot of the stores to be too high-end for me, but there's also a ton of stores that were in my price range as well!  Such a great variety!  And the markdowns were pretty amazing!

The drive is about 10 minutes from the strip, but beware of parking.  We went pretty early (11:30am-ish) and the parking structure was PACKED.  There were a line of cars queued WITHIN the parking structure since the aisles are generally one-way, one-lane, so cars get backed up when the front car is waiting for a stall.

The rate of a taxi from the strip I think is about $20 per way if I recall.

Like most of the outlets, the food selection isn't the greatest.  I'd recommend eating beforehand or planning on going somewhere else after, especially if you're a foodie like me.

It's an outdoor mall so be aware of the weather!"}
{"text":"Love this outlet mall! They have a large selection of shops, from high end brands to cheap stuff. I know that some brands tend to make cheaper quality stuff for their outlet sections, but there are still some great finds if you put in the time, and as far as holiday shopping goes, we all have those on our list who care more about the name than the quality, so as long as they're happy it's fine by me! They open pretty early (9am) and they have a steady stream of taxis going in and out of the outlet so for those that don't want to drive you don't have to worry about being stranded if you cab it there! They also have a decent food court and the place is clean and orderly. Great outlet shopping to be had here!"}
{"text":"While I am generally a fan, this really is a premium shopping district and no longer an \"outlet mall.\"  The stores are far more expensive and higher-name retailers than this mall used to have.  A number of the more reasonably priced retailers have been pushed out so don't go there looking for moderately priced merchandise."}
{"text":"[HOLIDAY RANT] The traffic flow through this outlet shopping center is just excruciating.  Big planning FAIL.  Takes forever just to get to the parking lots on those single lanes.  Poor pedestrians have to dodge and weave the grumpy drivers who've been tipped over the edge waiting and hunting for spots.  Trying to find a spot is harder than winning at a penny slot.  The store variety is the only thing going for this place, but the quality at outlets is just weak in comparison to the real stores.  Another thing was that they pumped up the heaters in all the stores so it was like an oven breeding ground cooking up all the holiday germs.  Yes it's cold outside, but did you ever think about the amount of BTUs the crowd puts out?  I'm just about through with outlet shopping. [END HOLIDAY RANT]"}
{"text":"Great selection of stores but horrendous parking! They have signs that say how many parking spots that are available but not accurate by any means. I went through the north garage with no luck then the small ground level, then the south garage until I found open spots on the roof. There seems to be other spots but they are closed off for some reason. I normally don't like going here for this reason and it's super crowded."}
{"text":"Best sales and a lot of good stores! Only thing is that it's really hot during the summer and it's an outdoor shopping mall. This is the north outlets by downtown Las Vegas. The south off blue diamond is good, but doesn't have as many good high end stores. The south outlets are in doors so that's the kicker."}
{"text":"In regards to outlet malls, this is one of the best I've been to especially after adding the high(er) end section (burberry, black and white, marciano, marc jacobs etc). Its clean, has parking garages, outside misters (not sure of the cool down especially when its 110). The prices are comparable if not more than sales prices at the regular stores. You can occasionally find good sales or buys but they generally have a good selection you can choose from. I loved this place better than the one in Ontario which claims to be the biggest but definitely not the best."}
{"text":"Located across from the women's coach store is this  men's store.

The employee who helped us was kind and professional. 
Excellent customer service. (Better than the women's side)

They have limited edition accessories with baseball teams. We bought one for a friend who is a sports fan."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here on and off for years when I visit. Now I have to pay $5.00 to park !? I have never had to pay to park in a mall parking lot...ridiculous..."}
{"text":"LoveLoveLove this place.  I shopped here twice in December and once in April.  I will be back in late July / early August.  My first and second time there, I discovered that my beloved Burberry packable nylon tote was available in the exact color I'd been looking for back home.  At LeSportsac, the only place I trust for quality and durability in terms of makeup bags, I found several of them at ridiculously cheap prices.  At the Disney Store, I picked up a very cute Piglet stuffed animal and decided that waiting in a long line to buy it was worth my time.  At Ecko Unltd, I purchased a comfortable pair of black yoga pants for way less than $20.  At Lacoste, I found a comfortable polo shirt and a large cosmetic tote, the latter of which I ended up using quite often for the remainder of my trip. 

Weirdly enough, it's easier to remember what stores I shopped at in December 2010 than it is to recall my experience in April.  I think this is largely due to differences in stock (there was more available during the holiday season), the weather (December was cold, but April was super duper uncomfortable h-o-t), my mood (I think I was grouchy / tired on my last visit) and the simple fact that I was here twice in December, compared to only once in April.

Nevertheless, I did find quite a few things in April as well.  The most noteworthy purchases are my Ecko Red large women's jacket (hard to find back home) and my Vans all-black sneakers in women's size 5 (almost impossible to find anywhere).  These are items that I consider wardrobe staples, and I found myself using them the same day of purchase.

All in all, I highly recommend shopping at LVPON.  There's something for everyone here, no matter your preferences or budget.

Oh yeah... and the food / drink selection is adequate with 10 establishments.  WTG with the Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This place is about an average size outlet.  Probably the best prices around in the area.

The security guards zip through everyone on their segways which is probably a bit dangerous.  Maybe they thought they were cool to be able to use one or something, but they should slow down.

It was pretty busy with a lot of travelers too."}
{"text":"I work here. I shop here. I DO NOT waste my money on this food court. It's the absolute worst. Everyone that works at the food places here always seem to be in a horrible mood... 

You'll always be able to find good sales here."}
{"text":"I am used to going to Simon Premium Outlets as there are a lot in California, however this one in Vegas took me by surprise to see how big it was with a lot of high end stores that are usually not at the other outlets. Parking took about 30 minutes because of a small 5 story garage, but the mall itself had a lot of aspects to it and overall was very nice to be able to see new shops. It is definitely easy to get lost here if you're unfamiliar. I did not get a chance to try the food, but there were plenty of options at the food court!"}
{"text":"Great variety of shops but the parking is terrible. If not for the good deals on clothes and shoes, I wouldn't come here. Also it's outdoors so when the weather is extremely cold you will feel the chill and when its blazing hot in the summer you won't want to be outside."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!!!  Coach, Charlotte Russe, White/Black clothes shop, Aldo, Adidas, Kate Spade, Puma, Banana Republic! 

We spent a good 5 hours here. And walked out with some amazing deals! 

I agree with Cynthia A. that they could have better food options.  But we just cabbed it to In n Out on our way back to the strip instead. 

Will be back, the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly suprised by this shopping center. It is large and has a food court along with two parking garages. Lots of variety of stores. Some that i was suprised by was citizen watch store and under armor store and famous footwear. Great location, appreciated that it was off the strip between downtown and main strip as it allows for easy access on all sides. Total got some great deals, we will be back."}
{"text":"This outlet is located away from the strip and is accessible by public transport. 
This location has way better variety than the south location and being out door and newer it has much better clean feel. 
Though I wouldn't recommend it on a hot day. There way a lineup outside Starbucks and Ice Cream shops of people just trying to get something to quench their thirst.
Food options are a bit better as well and I recommend the Makino AYCE Japanese.
For store I just luv luv the Armani Exchange outlet. 
Parking can be tight so beware of that and this place does get its fair share of traffic. 
I recommend this place if you can't drive to Primm."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were in town for a conference and excited to a do some shopping during our limited free time. This place is huge with a wide selection of stores. I give it only three stars because it's a long ride from 'The Strip' especially when you take the bus, and the prices are very high at most of the stores so it doesn't seem like you are getting a bargain at all. The most reasonable prices I found were at Ann Taylor where they had dressy work tops from $15-19. 

Many of the stores felt really empty to me in terms of clothing and other merchandise. At a couple of the stores I was super bored while my coworker tried on a few things as I found that I had already circled around through the stores and that I'd already seen everything there was to see. 

There are very few dining options outside of a few fast food places. We ended up eating dinner at Starbucks, which is always good. 

In the end it wasn't worth it to us to make this trek. My coworker only found one thing to buy, and I didn't find anything. It was fun to check the place out, but I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Over crowed with tour buses and no parking.  Go early or late.  The outlet itself is good if you need to go to one store. Outlet south and Primm have the same stores with less people."}
{"text":"I love this place, it has such a better selection than the other Premium Outlets in other cities.  It has better designer stores, woohoo!"}
{"text":"So your at the Wynn and your on a heater.  The table eventually cools down and you walk away nicely colored chips in your hand.  It's only natural to walk over to the shoppes and see if you can treat yourself to something nice.  There is the problem my friends, you can treat yourself to something (singular) nice.  So I got into the car and drove down to the Outlets off of Charleston and noticed that I didn't have to think about only being able to buy one thing anymore. 

This place was pretty sweet.  There were some stores (Banana) that had jaw dropping deals, and others (Hugo) that just made you scratch your head.  There were quite a bit of high end stores and, if you can stand the heat, definitely worth the visit.  If you're wondering....Yes, I did leave with some items (plural)."}
{"text":"Open even on a holiday! Parking structure has recently been updated to include red and green lights to tell you from a far when there's a vacancy. Hot as heck out here and super crowded but most things are on sale. Outlet stores include Nike, Adidas, Nine West, Claire's, Polo, Starbucks, Zales, White house black market, and many more. If you plan to eat in the food court know that space is very limited."}
{"text":"Awesome outlet mall! I wish they had outlets like this in San Antonio. They had a lot of great deals on Christmas Eve this year but I do wish that this outlet mall had an easier layout to navigate. Come early with a game plan and where comfortable walking shoes. Also, if you are planning on shopping at popular stores like Coach or Michael Kors, go there first because by 12 noon there will a line you have to wait in outside."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. I have been coming here for years when we travel to Vegas and all of a sudden the parking structure now cost money to park! Seriously?!  Why would you want to pay to park at a mall or outlet?  Of course the structure is full of idiots willing to pay including us because it was out of our way to drive to them since they are in North Vegas not near the strip. So we ended up letting them rip us off along with everyone else. But now that I know this we will NOT be back in the future. I also feel that the pricing for stuff there is no longer \"outlet\" prices. But rather the same price as a regular mall. Which you can go to anywhere and also not have to pay to park!"}
{"text":"New look, nicely laid out, easy to navigate.  

There's lots of stores to browse, but I really didn't see a lot of true bargains.  Most merchandise was discounted the same amount as you would find in a regular (non-outlet) shopping mall.  

The weather was great when I went, but I can imagine how miserable a person would be walking around this place in the middle of July."}
{"text":"Definitely not a bad outlet in any way.  There were LOTS of people there, even on a weekend, and probably around 70% of them being tourists.  Which isn't always a bad thing.  Unless they're rude tourists.  Because I then get pretty annoyed.

I do like the huge range of stores they have, and they're all pretty nicely arranged where there are two main \"streets\" you can browse through to hit majority of the stores.  There are branches into other smaller stores or the Food Court, for example, but most of the shops are just on these main two rows. The shops are of all various items, though my favorite ones to browse have been Pandora and Fossil, while hubby was going through all of the shoe stores recently (we both have mutant fat feet).

For parking, you can park across from it and walk on over, or just hit the parking structure that is at the end of it.  Pretty convenient parking, especially because they're all sensored so that you know what space has been taken, and how many spaces are open on a given parking level.

Pretty close to the strip, though getting here during rush hour may be a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"I would say that this outlet has a lot of the \"premium\" brand outlets that most people would be looking for, although I thought this place was total crap.

The \"common\" areas of this mall are all outside, so each business has doors to go in, it's like a giant strip mall. For people not familar with the stores names, you have no idea what's inside. So many of the window displays were hard to see, so we didn't end up going in many stores. This is probably the first \"mall\" I've went to in my life and not bought a thing. Lots of stuff here you'll find at other malls."}
{"text":"Large and clean. During the hot summers, they have mist blowing. Parking is ridiculous but it's Vegas."}
{"text":"I love shopping at this outlet mall!

One thing you should always do when shopping here is ask the store if they have a discount for those who purchased a coupon book at the Outlet mall guest center.  Sometimes places will give you an additional discount if you purchased the $10 booklet up front.  It can really save you a lot of $ if you plan on spending a lot.

It's hard to find an outlet mall with such a wide selection of stores.  And it always beats paying full price at some of the places on the strip.  And it's not really that far away if you want a break from the strip while visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has easily become one of the go-to malls in Vegas for locals and visitors alike. It has lots of stores I tend to frequent like Gap, Converse, and Aldos. There are lots of great deals to be had, one just has to look! There are lots of higher-end stores as well which makes for a nice mix. It is an outdoor mall so dress accordingly! Sometimes in the spring and summer some of the misters don't work that well and \"spit\" out water as opposed to \"misting\" it lol!"}
{"text":"Nicer layout than the Outlets on the south side. Tricky parking though."}
{"text":"This outlet has a large selection of stores better than the oulet at Primm.  I only wish they had a Williams Sonoma store.  I didn't see any empty stores which is what I've been seeing in other outlet malls.  The food court and restaurants are okay.  The parking sucks when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed shopping here they have SOOO MANY outlet stores, but we only went to Gap, Hurley, and Godiva (looove the choco dipped strawberries but they're $12.50 for 6!!). Definitely recommend shopping here."}
{"text":"There are basically 2 outlets near The Strip.  In fact, they are on opposite sides of The Strip.  One is an outdoor outlet, the other is indoor.  This particular review is for the former.  I think in comparison to each other, I prefer this one.  However, when it's the dead of summer and it's reaching 120 degrees outside, I'd prefer the indoor one.  But, in terms of shopping, I like the stores here.  They have a good Tommy Hilfiger store that always has good deals when I go there.  Also, the Nike outlet always seems to be stocked with stuff I could use and if it's on sale, stuff I could afford.  I also like the fact that there are like 2 or 3 different stores where I could buy cooking supplies.  That way, when the Mrs is looking at girly clothes, I have somewhere to go.

As for the food court, skip it.  There nothing over there worth going to.  With that being said, the food's not bad there, it's just that I'd rather go somewhere else if possible.  Parking is not a problem.  Wait, let me rephrase a little.  Parking is not a problem if you go some time other than the holiday season.  If it's black Friday, then good luck!"}
{"text":"I love this outlet more than the Premium South outlet and Fashion Show mall for a few reasons.  This outlet has a lot more brand name stores and you can find some things that are highly discounted.  And, this outlet is closer to the strip than the South outlet. 

If you have to choose one place to shop in Vegas, I would choose Premium north outlets.  Just try to go early in the morning or later in the day when it isn't so hot as it's an outdoor shopping center."}
{"text":"Cool outdoor mall...had just about everything, great sales too.

major props for the AC food court, although it didn't feel cool while in there, but I knew it was much cooler inside compared to how hot it was outside."}
{"text":"Las Vegas North Premium outlets, one of my favorite places to shop! 

Coach outlet. 
Pandora outlet. 
Claire's. 
Michael Kors outlet. 
Tory burch outlet. 
Hot topic. 
Cheesecake Factory. 
Starbucks! 
A food court! 
Just to name a few :)

This outlet mall is an OUTDOOR mall, one of my favorite features would be the parking lot! I swear everywhere in this country needs that system!! Red light taken. Green light empty! That saves so much time  for parking! Especially because it even shows the amount of stalls that are available. 
This outlet mall is also very clean! Big plus!"}
{"text":"Spent way more than anticipated, but got great deals at the William Sonoma and Coach Factory Outlet. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"It seems like at some point the idea behind outlet shopping has changed.  It used to be a way that manufacturers could sell direct to the public stuff that retailers didn't want (slightly damaged, out of date seasons) at cheap cheap prices.

It seems lately like it's simply a place where these manufacturers can cut out the retailer's margins and sell direct to the public.  The prices really aren't weren't that good on my last visit (is it just me that noticed this?).  Maybe it was just because we were shopping the weekend after 4th of July weekend, but I found it was hard to find anything beyond 10 to 20% off in most stores.

We went to the non-outlet fashion show mall (ON THE STRIP) and were able to find many of the same products we were looking for for cheaper. 

If you take away the cheap prices then I'm just walking around in 110+ degree weather, and if that's the case i would prefer to be browsing around in a nice comfy air conditioned mall :).

Helpful tip: If you're looking at getting to the mall from the strip for cheap, take the ACE bus.  It doesn't stop at every single hotel like the deuce and is way cheaper than taking a taxi."}
{"text":"Always a fan of outlets - especially when they carry name branded stores. Tory Burch, Lacoste, Nike Factory, etc. It was really crowded when we went - given it was St. Patrick's day. 

First time here though. Next time we're going to explore the South one."}
{"text":"I try to avoid the Malls and department stores as much as possible but especially the outlet malls because it is out doors and in Vegas I can't handle the heat. Shopping amongst a million and one locals and tourist, and fighting for good deals is really not my idea of a good time. But when I do find myself here it is hard not to go bonkers, I mean when I shop I shop! 

I haven't been here in a loooooong time since before they renovated but to my surprise it looks very good. They have added parking with high tech parking assistance and cool shaded benches to help cool down customers which is a great idea and not to mention they look esthetically  nice. There are more stores then before and now there's even a Cheese Cake Factory which is nice to have a dinning spot as oppose to the food court. 

Anyhow regardless of how much I hate shopping dealing with the cray cray ness I do have a weak spot for the this outlet because of the tiny bit of discount I get now it's that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I luckily went here on a day when it wasn't too hot, but if ti had been, it would have been miserable.  With that being said, they have a lot of nice stores to choose from.  I am not big into name brands myself, but I do love me some Juicy Couture and they have a good selection.  Sometimes I just make a beeline for the back of store where the super clearance is at and you can usually find stuff for even better prices.  And no one has to know unless you have snooty friends who actually care what \"season\" your clothes are from.

Also, watch out for tourists from Asia: they are ferocious when it comes to buying purses and carry so many shopping bags that they take up half the walkway."}
{"text":"Great selection of stores. It was a short ride from the strip. It's e fun place to spend some of your winnings."}
{"text":"It's a nice time... during nice weather.  it's outside so it's not comfy in the summer.  I don't always come out of this place with awesome finds.  It's just like any typical outlet... but with more of a mall look.

you'll find A LOT of shops to browse through.
coach, pacific sunwear, zumies, charlotte russe, nike... sunglass hut.
there are also restaurants here..  [i've never been]

don't come often cause it's a drive, but when i do end up here it's usually with family in the summer, and the good thing about that is the misters."}
{"text":"Stores are great, wide selections and variety. With Some new stores opening soon. Such as American Eagle Factory. Parking is very limited in the weekends. You cannot park in the government office parkings. Try going during weekdays when it's smoother."}
{"text":"This is probably the best outlet mall I have ever been to. Not only does it have great stores, it is also just a nice outdoor mall (far superior to the bland concrete strip malls that are other outlet centers).

It can be a challenge to get here, though. I think they deliberately made parking difficult so you have time to truly work up your shopping appetite. Hint: Parking garage B always seems to be less crowded than parking garage A, and don't even bother with trying to valet (the valet has been \"full\" every time I've been here). 

If you are visiting Vegas and didn't rent a car, there is a direct bus here from the Strip. There is also a taxi stand for easy return to the Strip when loaded down with shopping bags.

It can be helpful to create a plan of attack before arriving. To me at least, this is not a place I like to just wander about and shop. It's always crowded, and for someone like me who is directionally-challenged, I can get lost easily in this shopping maze. Hint: You can go to the website and print off a map.

The deals you find here can be spectacular. My two favorite places are Kate Spade and Kenneth Cole. There's nothing quite like the feeling of a 1/2 price leather clutch and 2 for 1 skinny jeans.

Hint: If you are 50+, or shopping with someone who is, you get an additional 10% off at select stores on Tuesdays. You can view the list of stores on the website."}
{"text":"Shopped here December 29, 2016. Nice outlet with a good variety of stores.  Just like any outlet know your pricing before buying merchandise.  Lots of parking but it did get busy later in the day.  Outdoor shopping so it is open to the elements."}
{"text":"On the plus side, they have some stores that are atypical of outlet malls. On the negative side, the deals are not plentiful. They know that you are tourists and that you'll buy anything that is \"on sale\". Beware that some of the items are made-for-outlet only and therefore can be sold at a discount price. 

The parking is good. The stores are situated in a big circle pattern so you'll be able to hit all the stores. Again, the bargains are slim so you really have to pay attention."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to shop!  Best boutiques - you will always find something!  Now if only we had a Jimmy Choo or a Gucci outlet there..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now, and I have to say this is by far my favorite outlet center. I do wish that there was more shade since Vegas can get wicked hot in the summer, but overall a fine shopping experience.

Food court is a little lacking in variety, but it'll do in a pinch when you've been on a shopping binge for a couple of hours and realize it's well past time for lunch.

Addition of parking structures is great. At least your car won't be melting hot when you finish your shopping binge.

Mall is pretty large and oddly shaped, so make sure to check one of the posted maps to ensure you haven't missed anything. This is a must-stop for me whenever I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"For all you bargain hunters out there, I think it would definitely be worth your time to check out this place.  Although it's an open-air mall, there are a lot of name-brand stores, ample parking in 2 garages, and a somewhat decent food court.  This place even has a starbucks!

M-U-S-T:

1)  For all you fellow Gap and Banana Republic shoppers, do
visit the locations here, there's a bargain waiting to be found!  

2)  I thought there were some pretty good deals at Kenneth Cole on shoes and dress shirts.  I also found a winter jacket, but nixed the idea of buying it almost right away, WHEN would I ever use it in this tropical weather we live in.

3)  Lastly, if you are in need of sunglasses (which I wasn't but I bought them anyway), stop by the Fossil outlet where the sunglasses are priced at a bargain in all shapes and styles.  Just a small NOTE:  Since this IS the outlet, the sunglasses cases cost extra...just fyi.  


C-A-U-T-I-O-N:

1)  Be mindful of the force.....of the weather, it IS an open air mall with not much shade if you're caught in a downpour or even a light drizzle.

2)  Be mindful of the kiosk vendors selling goods that sounds too good to pass up, merchandise you might not need, or stuff that's sold on infomercials.  They're slightly annoying to say the least.

Bottom Line:  A place to consider if on the hunt for a bargain."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So nice to shop at an out door mall. I wish they would bring the food trucks back. And beware of this really tall large breasted Asian woman. She will eat you whole."}
{"text":"This is a great outdoor outlet mall! The Simon outlet family is always great. Tons of high end stores here and I particularly enjoyed the following shops:

1. Tory Burch- omigosh this place was HUGE. They had some items for 50% off when I visited. Excellent selection even though I walked out empty handed. 
2. Gap Kids outlet- loooooved this shop! Great sales- I got some pants for $2.97 for my kiddo! The clearance section was wonderful. 
3. Ralph Lauren kids- pretty tiny inside compared to the other stores I walked into. 
4. Chipotle- always a great place to stop for a bite to eat. Portions are smaller here than at other locations, I feel. 
5. kate spade- huge, gorgeous store!! A gigantic selection even though again, I walked out empty handed. 
6. Oliver Peoples- first one I've ever seen. 
7. Lulu Lemon- very nice sales associates! Great deals!

This is definitely the outlet location to visit if you only have time to visit one while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"They have a good selection of stores. I love the cool mist fans throughout to help keep you cool on those warm days. They are missing a couple stores i'd like to see like A&F but for the most part one of the best i've seen."}
{"text":"you can only gamble and drink for so long. take a break and come to the outlet and get your  shopping on. When  my girls and I went it was hardly anyone there. so you can enjoy strolling along, window shop, actual shop , great bargains on top of the line  stuff  too!and then go to your hotel and rest."}
{"text":"Great big outlet shopping spree! Yay! This is probably one of the better outdoor outlets that I've been to. Lots of variety... from J.Crew to BR... to Coach and more! My friends and I went at the perfect time: New Years Eve. Markdowns were everywhere, and it wasn't crowded to the point where we weren't helped. Must go back!"}
{"text":"lots of window and people watching but less deals than a decade ago.  i still go in the am when its less crowded"}
{"text":"A lot of shops to chose from, a lot the shops have great deals too. There is a Nike and under amour store. Parking in a garage which is always good. What more can you say about an outlet, if you been to one they are all kind of the same."}
{"text":"One of favorite outlets.  I always stop here when I'm in Vegas. Good variety of stores.  This past weekend 60+20% off at Kate Spade.  40% off entire store at Tory Burch.  My favorite store this time is Godiva.  Yum.  Bought 20 packs of cookies for $40.  You get free samples and the store manager and staff were extremely nice!  Prices are so good here.  Make sure you stop by customer service with your AAA card to get a coupon booklet!  I never shop at outlets without picking one up.  Not all stores are in there but it has a lots of good deals.  One of the thickest outlet booklets out there."}
{"text":"This place has definitely grown in size and store selection over the years. An awesome outlet to score major deals. Bet your bottom dollar that this place has something for every one. Even my husband who never buys any clothes managed to spend some money here. Ample parking."}
{"text":"We like to come here fairly often, the Bebe store in particular is always having sales and they have relevant styles avaialble.  The open area to walk around is nice especially in the evenings or when the weather is mild.  Best parking garage around because the sensors that tell you what spaces are avaialble!  The rest of the shops there are also great and many times can do holiday shopping in one day because there is something there for everyone!"}
{"text":"Two elevators and one escalator out off order. Retailers have their sale racks blocking the walkway.  Clear ADA violations - they should be ashamed of themselves. Then the entire south garage has been retired in a fashion that only makes traffic congestion worse. Terrible planning and foresight by management. It'll be a long time before I go back. I'll definitely avoid it on the weekends."}
{"text":"I was very ecstatic when I arrived at the prem outlets! I did a little research prior to see what shops they had.. TONS AND TONS of shops... I actually didn't get to go all the way around because I had plans to attend to.. but I did find a lot of good stuff and great deals. The coach outlet always does me right.. they always give away coupons to lure people to buy stuff and it works! Me and my aunt purchased over $350 worth of stuff and got 30% off each item. In the end we got 3 things for only $200. Amazing. The True Religion outlet is AWESOME! $99.99 for Trues are a steal.. they also have some more intricate designs for $120. The Ed Hardy store is OK.. nothing really to rave about. The Juicy outlet was pretty great, they had an additional 20% off but I didn't find anything of my liking. Overall I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is a city with indulgence and bargains so it make sense to have outlets that are found on both ends of the strip.  These outlets are on the north end, you'd drive past the strip on I-15 on the way to downtown.  

There are high end shops and also more affordable options for us middle class citizens. =)  I would say that the Coach store & Nike store are usually pretty crowded - I am a personal fan of the Gap and Aldo stores.  There's a very large selection of stores to shop at and it is an outdoor outlet.  There's a food court as well.  It's a good place to shop and kill a few hours if you want to get away from the typical Vegas stuff."}
{"text":"Overall the place is nice. Food, shopping , restrooms, ect.
Bring a light jacket. It gets windy since it's outdoor.
Not very crowded on weekdays but weekends mabey different. Friendly staff. Clean mall. There are a variety of retail to choose from. 
I'm sure there's public buses that run there but cabs are there waiting for you at the front."}
{"text":"This is going to be short and sweet.  Three words: Coach Outlet Store. Fantastic selection of bags at awesome prices.  That, my friend, is what a true outlet store should be.  Oh, and there are some other awesome outlet stores there too: Banana Republic, JCrew, Converse, Burberry, BCBG, and the list goes on and on.  

Even if you lost big in Vegas, you can still feel like a winner at Premium Outlets!"}
{"text":"Top tips!

1. Come during the week during business hours so as to avoid crowds.

2. Look closely at prices.  Some are not lower than the main retail store.

3. Some merchandise is the same (just a season or so older) than the main retail store. Other merchandise is definitely designed for the outlet.

4. Adequate food court with at least one healthy choice. Please note there are other eateries scattered around e.g. Chipotle, Starbucks and Dairy Queen.

5. Convenient walk from Fremont St. /Downtown.  Check out Fremont before your shopping excursion so you won't have to lug bags."}
{"text":"Love this outlet! We go here everytime we are in town. Always great finds!"}
{"text":"We only came here to grab a pair of shades at the Oakley store.  It is basically a million degrees and you run from store to store to get onto the ac.  I feel super bad for the people working the kiosks outside.  HOT!"}
{"text":"I have been shopping here since years...
But in recent times the experience hv gone worst.. especially with respect to customer service...

Esp. Guess factory store.. hv been shoppimg here since years but this time round.. everyone was very arrogant... not sure what piss them about me..... guess at guess... still bought because their styles are good.

Also this saving passport didnt work anywhere...
So don't count those coupon codes as evrything wud be a dollar cheap n it dint apply on a any item i bought anywhere"}
{"text":"Nothing impressive here...

I've been in 8 of these \"premium outlets\" around the southern states, and they're really all the same. If you're looking for a bunch of fashion stores that pretend to lower their prices and sell you last seasons collection, then you're in the right place.

No seriously, the sketchers \"outlet\" had 40-70% discounts on their shoes, but they had the exact same prices as the normal sketchers store inside Vegas... Seriously bulls**t as usual."}
{"text":"A nice outdoor mall. We took a stroll to burn a couple of hours while I finished killing off our credit cards and my husband took a mental nap. 

The mix of stores is interesting. We found both high-end and pedestrian shops. The finds are hit or miss since its all subjective on what you consider a good \"deal\". I loved that it was less intimidating to go into the higher end stores here vs a luxury mall but at 90% sale some of these garments still come up to several hundred dollars so it's still a splurge. 

Nevertheless the few things I managed to score I don't think I could have found anywhere else. Definitely a place to visit if your patient enough to search carefully."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the premium outlets in Las Vegas. We came here for some after Christmas shopping and the stores did not disappoint. Plus the sales tax is cheaper than California, so that helps too, haha.

My favorite store has to be the Columbia outlet. Jackets galore for women. I don't think I saw any jackets more than $90 in that entire store, including their snowboarding jackets. Plus if you sign up for their email list you get 10% off your entire purchase.

It is a spacious outdoor mall, so in the winter it is cold."}
{"text":"Pretty neat outlet with many neat stores all around. Went to just polo and burberry and bought a lot of their stuff due to the right sales and price. There were a lot of stores but felt like only some were just there to fill the space, but it was still a fun adventure to look around."}
{"text":"A few minutes north of the strip this place is well worth the trip.  If you had a lucky day in the casino and decide to splurge, this is the place to be.  Tons of high end retailers that provide rock bottom pricing are just footsteps away from each other.  

If you are a AAA Member, be sure to visit the information kiosk right in front of the entrance to get a booklet containing additional discounts. 

Shop til you drop!"}
{"text":"Black Friday at an outlet is always crazy. I cannot believe I was one of those people that went and braved the crowds. From last year, they updated the selection of stores from Coach, Dooney and Burke, LeSport Sac, Polo Ralph Lauren, Banana Republic, Black House White Market, Juice Couture, Quicksilver, Billabong, and so many others to remember. 
They have a decent sized food court with a generous space for eating. They also have a Starbucks which happens to be crowded every single moment, so line up early!

This outlet is one of my favorites, and there are always good deals through out the year."}
{"text":"Shopping at its best! I love the north end outlets! Great shopping, I always find deals & I love the indoor/outdoor shopping atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This outlet had some major upgrades since I last visited (which was when I was in my teens.... Meaning a LONG LONG LONG time ago). I guess being owned by Simon Malls has it's perks!
Pros----
---Premium brands...... Lululemon, Oliver People's, All Saints, Carolina Herrera, Neiman's Last Call, Rag & Bone, Scotch & Soda
---They also have stuff for the kids like Gymboree, OshKosh,Disney Store
---Mist sprayers in the walkways. They sort of help keep you cool.
Cons---
--Parking in the main structure is c.r.a.p. I think it took us around 30-45minutes just to secure a space, which was a total game killer. After driving up to the top, I headed down and just so happened to find a car pulling out close to the entrance. This prevented us from actually going through the whole place.
--It's outdoors. With the sweltering desert heat, it can get pretty miserable.
--You're not saving much money, if any at all. I mean, this is for the higher end stuff. Mid-level stores actually had the better deals!"}
{"text":"This outlet location has gotten better in so many respects in the past few years. These days they have a great selection of quality store. It seems very clean, they have misting systems in some locations & more security than they had in the past. Wish they had a big & tall mans outlet here, Lane Bryant & Niemans or Nordstroms. All in all it is a great experience these days with a nice food court & even an Orange Julius:)"}
{"text":"Super deals any random day.  Seriously too much fun!  We came here before leaving Vegas for the weekend and it was just the perfect send-off.  I couldn't think of a better way to spend my hard earned money.

Treasures-galore!"}
{"text":"Don't get this confused with the  Las Vegas Outlet Center on Las Vegas Blvd. 

Take note that you shouldn't plan to come here on a hot day since this is an outdoor mall. You will be sweating buckets. With that said, I've been lucky to come here on days with bearable weather. Unlike the other (indoor) outlet mall in Las Vegas, this outlet mall has a better selection of stores such as Coach, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, French Connection, Timberland, Dolce & Gabbana, and Banana Republic, just to name a few. Parking can be hectic, but that can be resolved in a snap if you are willing to pay $5 for valet."}
{"text":"Not a bad selection of stores, which are mostly higher end. Can't say that I've ever found too many great items or deals here. As you all know, items at outlet malls are either seconds, made specifically for outlets, or the stuff they couldn't get rid of at clearance price at the regular stores. However, if you're visiting from another country, chances are the exchange rate will be in your favor and can get items you can't get back home for cheap. And if you're an XXS or XXL, you're in luck, as they'll probably have your size.

They have added an additional wing to the mall now which has stores including John Varvatos, All Saints, G Star, and many others. The funny thing is so many of these shop workers have better-than-you attitude. Dude, you work at a mall--an outlet mall. Get over yourself.

After finding all those great deals LOL you can fill up at the many(!) Auntie Anne's pretzels stands or the brick and mortar location, or stand in line at one of two Starbucks. There's also a large food court in the center with a huge white circus like tent cover for plenty of shade."}
{"text":"Fun to go a few times a year with visiting friends and family.  I like the outdoor element -- get your exercise in whilst hunting for bargains!  I've found better deals in the non-outlet versions, but it doesn't hurt to look around.  The food court is rather lame for a 'premium' outlet mall; I mean, really, only a handful of offerings (Subway, a pizza place, a Japanese-style fast food outlet, etc.) facing a dining area that could use some redecorating.

Come here on weekdays, not weekends, if you don't want to run out of patience!"}
{"text":"Always fun to walk around.  Silly how expensive these stores are but very beautiful lay out and if you win in Vegas... great place to shop!"}
{"text":"Tons and tons of great shops! Love this outlet mall they have it all. Be ready for a day full of shopping!

They added more restaurants too so you dont just have the food court as an option. 

Its outdoor so be ready for the warm weather."}
{"text":"If you like shopping, especially at outlets, come here for shopping! They have your usual outlet stores, mostly high end brands at low prices.

My boyfriend and I don't like shopping, but we came here anyways haha. There was a big Nike store here, but after seeing the line - we said nehhhhhh.

This shopping center is outdoors, so I can't imagine enjoying this place even more during the summer (triple digit temperatures) or winter (30 degree weather!??!!). Luckily, the food court is indoors with plenty of seating HAHA.

Parking can be a B though. Plan ahead :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of stores.  Its outside but is worth the amount of deals and discounts you get in all the stores.  Is worth a visit.  Must check out the Kate Spade for exclusive bags."}
{"text":"My wife enjoys paying a visit to this outlet when we make the family trip to Vegas. I don't mind but my kids would rather be at the pool, I don't blame them. We usually bribe them with some Orange Julius, which can be found at the Food Court.

My wife convinces me to come here because the car will be parked in the shade inside the parking structure. Okay, I guess the car won't be hot after some shopping. She also reminds me about Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, and The Nike Outlet. Some shopping for myself is also a good selling point.

As for my wife will spend her time at Carter's, The Children's Place, Disney Store Outlet, Gap Kids & Baby, Lucky Brand, J. Crew, Coach, Godiva, and the list goes on. I'll be honest, the shopping portion of Vegas is all about her. After all we are on vacation and she needs her own fun ;o)"}
{"text":"This outlet is awesome, I love the selection of stores and brands they offer; although I am a little miffed about them taking out FCUK. Another thing that I docked off a star was because its already so hot in Vegas, that outdoor malls aren't ideal =/ Other than that, this is where I like to do shopping in Vegas.

This outlet has a pretty good selection, everything from cosmetics to fragrances to Guess to Coach; definitely hits a wide range of audiences."}
{"text":"I am a frequent Las Vegas visitor and shopper and I never go without stopping at these outlets.
First of all, they have a wide selection of stores...a little bit of everything for everyone...but they do have the usual favorite designer stores. 
My best advice to get the best deals is to go on holidays and weekends. Yes its busy but they have way better deals. If you go during the week, there are usually no special deals and it's not worth going there. The whole point of outlets is to get good deals. 
I usually stop here during Black Friday. Warning to all those that go this year...its freaking cold, parking is horrible, and there are LOTS of people. Despite this, I enjoy going every year because I get awesome deals. Some of the stores even form lines, like Coach, they only let a certain amount of people in at a time, so a huge line forms outside. This is common on black friday. 
So if you don't like the madness and the cold, stay out of here! we don't need grumpy people shopping around because you will need a lot of patience for shopping on this day.
Otherwise, one of my favorite outlets to shop at!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some nice clothes at a discount price. They have something for almost everyone. I know I always fine something when I go and I'm not even looking. I almost want to avoid this place because it's just more stuff that I really don't need."}
{"text":"This is the better outlet mall in Vegas as far as I can remember. It's an outdoors shopping mall with a multilevel parking garage. Last time I went to the one at the other end of the strip I was really unimpressed and haven't returned since, so it's been a few years. 

While it IS ridiculously hot out during a majority of the year, there are small cooling stations scattered about. All of the bathrooms and stores are well air conditioned and there are vendors or machines dispensing drinks at frequent intervals. Still, I'd come around sunset due to personal preference as I'm a nocturnal lass and dislike excessive sun. No, I don't sparkle. ;}
 
I find this a fun place to come and window shop or people watch. It's also good exercise, doing laps around the large rectangle trying to find any cool stores I may have passed by first time around. There are a lot of fashionable foreign people, most likely drawn by the Armani Exchange and likewise stores dotted throughout. There are stores suited to a wide variety of budgets if you're willing to look around. Even the American Apparel store had some decent prices on things when I ambled through!

While I didn't eat in the food court this time, I remember it being uncomfortably hot and the food unpleasant. There's a sushi restaurant and a Starbucks, plus multiple vendors, so it shouldn't be too hard to find quasi-appetizing edibles. But really, who goes to the mall to eat? It's all about the shopping!"}
{"text":"As a guy, im not into shopping and trying stuff on, matching this with that.  Just get me in and out as quickly as possible.  But i do like a good bargain, and this is the place to find it!  

I basically come here once a year and get all my shopping for the whole year in one shot!  (usually on a 3 day weekend sale).

Deals i've gotten in the past
Quicksilver khakis, and board shorts (regular price $45 - 50) $15
Ecco shoes (regular price $150) $40
Izod polo shirts (Regular price $40 - $50) $12
Johnston and Murphy shoes (regular $150) $60
DKNY jeans (regular $70) $25
Perry Ellis polo shirt (regular $50) $10
Oakley collar shirt (regular $45 - $55) $15
Oakley double thick Hoodie (regular $70) $15
Quicksilver Jeans (regular $50) $10
Jockey underwear (regular $20) $10
you're basically looking at my whole wardrobe for the past 2 or 3 years here! 

So yes, i hate shopping but at such a steal, i can put up with one day a year and save well over 50%!  I never end up spending less than $300. I think i now understand women when they come back with bags and bags of clothes and say, \"But im saving so much money.\"  To be honest I think I actually enjoy it;  So any place that can get me to enjoy shopping is 5 Stars all the way!

Some tips to save even more money is, create an account on the premium outlet website https://www.premiumoutlets.com/ and join the VIP club.  This will get you a voucher for a coupon book which you pick up at the Information center, this saved me another $35 last time.  You can also print out more coupons from the website that that are not offered in the coupon book.  If you have AAA (for your car) they can get you the voucher for the coupon book too.  the VIP club is good for all their outlet malls around the US as well, so sign up for each one you might visit.

Tips: Mall opens at 10, be there at 10 or no later than 11, when i leave at around 1 or 2 there is a crazy line out the parking lot of cars trying to get in and find parking!  Guess people get a late start cause they are up partying all night.  
Come on a 3 day weekend for better sales, you'll be sure to find something!

Makino's is a good place to eat, all you can eat seafood and sushi."}
{"text":"It's shopping, and I'm a dude. Can I really give an outlet mall more than 3 stars? Hard to when it's 106F outside and little breeze and shading. 

My wife and I thought there weren't many real values at most of the stores, just a bunch of cheap looking and priced older styles usually. The good stuff was rarely marked down more than 20%. Usually priced just a hair under typical retail prices. The bargains were few and far between. Good vibe to the place though. Nice crowds, clean stores, and fairly benign sales people. Go when its cooler."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful Saturday in October, and maybe that was the problem. 

The mall, and that's what it is, an outside mall, has a lot of great stores, but it was crowded, had no deals, and we left.

Probably will not include this spot on future visits to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Yelp tells me that I have checked into this place 4 times-- that's it?!
I'm surprised! I feel like it should be more. I am infatuated with this outlet mall.

I can count all of Vegas' malls on both of my hands. Trust me, I've been to all of them, multiple times. As a mall connoisseur who just moved from LA, the land of shopping I can say with confidence that this is my favorite place to get my shop on. I usually valet ($6 not including tip) my car, although the parking structures are not bad here now that they tell you how many spaces are available on each level. Not a fan of the flow of traffic in the structure-- it can be a mad house, dodging cars left and right if you come on a busy day.

Here are some of my favorite places:

1. J.Crew-- This outlet location is the ONLY J.Crew in Las Vegas. There is no full line store in this desert. The service here is pretty great. If you are a teacher or a student, you can show them your ID and get a discount (even on top of sale items). Great place to get your work clothes and accessories! I am madly in love with their jewelry and shoes. 

2. Disney Store-- This location has great service and wonderful Disneyland park items. I scored on some awesome end of the year gifts for my students. Those lucky kids! Spreading my love of Disney one class at a time. 

3. Marc Jacobs-- Opened not too long ago, however their customer service is hit or miss. If you're a fan of MJ like I am, this place will have your wallet empty in no time.

4. North Face-- I never had to own a real jacket until I moved to Vegas. Come here for your winter gear. 

5. LuLulemon-- Also, opened not too long ago. Worth the browse, even though I have yet to really find anything really great here yet.

6. American Apparel-- This location has great deals on hoodies and tees. There is a full line store in Summerlin and also in PH. If your dog is in need of a well made hoodie, come here! My dog enjoys their comfortable sweatshirts in the winter.

7. Kate Spade-- Always a sale going on; definitely worth checking out if you like KS and their cute designs. Watermelon clutch anyone? 

8. Nike-- Always worth a quick peek. They have new things in here all of the time. Worth it if you are looking for work out clothes or sneakers. (pro tip: right next to the parking structure entrance!)

I used to always make an afternoon at this outlet when I would come to vegas for a weekend getaway. Now as a local, I still find this outlet worth my time. Maybe even more so than the typical malls around the Vegas area (Sorry  Sunset Galleria). Keep in mind this is an outdoor shopping center, so this may not be the best place to go when there is a crazy wind storm or extreme heat. 

Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since before I moved to Las Vegas (4 almost 5 years). It's changed a bit, not much. They added another parking garage hallelujah.. But parking is still a huge headache.

I'm usually a target or Walmart shopper for my daughters clothes due to location an prices but after coming here that's changed.

Hello $$$. Get back into my wallet. So many good deals it's hard nt to go crazy. Last week I sped $25 for a pair of jeans for y two year old from target but went to osh kosh and bought a pair of jeans and overalls for $27. Deal! Or steal? ;)

Love all the stores here, Michael kors, coach, nike, sketchers, fossil (who by the way has an 11 yr warranty on their watches) Charlotte Russe, Disney store, etc etc.

I think I will be Xmas shopping here but not in dec that's suicide."}
{"text":"The mall is a great place to be at but the 1 thing that downs tamale sense is the Parking. There should be more parking options then just the 2 parking garages. It's always packed & cars almost hitting each other."}
{"text":"This has an excellent selection of stores, much like other Premium Outlet locations.

Being here in March means outdoor shopping is great. I would probably subtract stars if this was in August.

Since I took a cab here, I didn't witness any of the parking issues that people spoke of but I can totally see how it would be a problem.

Discounts among stores are hit and miss. My wife really liked DKNY which had as much as 70% off while other stores either had no sale or had something pitiful in comparison. Why would I go to a factory outlet to save 10% over MSRP? There were even some cases where some items were full-priced.

The food court is poor. It has too few selections for such a large mall.

Free wifi would have been nice..."}
{"text":"So clean! Large selection!
Amazing stores!
L'Occitane, Coach and Tag Heuer are my faves.
I love to shop openly in hot, dry weather so, there is that and the parking garage is convenient. 
Encountered friendly staff all day long."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas North Premium Outlet was one of the better outlets I had been to in a long time.  We went here on Thanksgiving day and this place was crowded.  It was pretty close to the hotel we stayed at.  The parking garage still had a lot of space left on the upper floors when we came around noon.  This was the first time I saw the parking garage with an indicator to let drivers know how many spots were opened and which spots were open indicated by the green or red light above each spot.

All of the stores were close together and separated by maybe a kiosk in between.  I looked at their website before coming here to know exactly which stores I wanted to check out.  After I walked through the whole outlet, I realized how small it was but had enough for most people's needs.  There was a food court which was pretty crowded considering it was Thanksgiving.  I remembered there were five different restaurants in the food court with Subway being one of them.

This outlet was good and I would recommend coming here to buy clothes or any merchandise."}
{"text":"My kids & I love to shop at this outlet mall but right now during their parking construction, it creates horrible traffic!! It took us over 30 min just to get out of there on a Saturday afternoon.  They have security trying to direct traffic but it doesn't help at all.

Also, the elevators are out of order in the parking garage. 

If you don't have the patience to sit in traffic after shopping several hours don't come here on a weekend."}
{"text":"Black Friday!!!! I thought I was crazy for going there . First of all I thought parking was going to be crazy, and it was, but I got lucky, found one as soon as I got there. So many stores, you just don't know where to start. FIRST OFF, don't park at the first parking structure...go to the one by Saks Fifth Avenue. I usually Valet, but they were full. Then go to the main office and get the map. I ALSO got the VIP passport for $10. Its full of great coupons, at first I got a little upset, because some stores didn't honor them, but then I understand, everything was at such great prices. But then a lot of them did, so I definitely got my money's worth. All the stores were well prepared. A lot of merchandise and great staff.Lines were going super fast. Got great savings....My favorite was UGG.I got 2 pairs. YOU NEVER FIND UGGS FOR SALE....anyway, highly recommend it if here in Vegas and don't want to blow all your money on gambling. Or go for it do it, I know it's a lot of fun, but  for my kids the outlet was funner blowing the rest of my money...on a serious note...great place, great deals!!!Have fun...  OH one more thing, if planning to do a lot of shopping, I saw a lot of people that brought big suitcase with wheels and stuffed all their bags in it, so you don't lose any bags....BRILLIANT!!!!"}
{"text":"It was our last day in Vegas and we had been talking about going to the outlets. 

This is an outdoor mall and I was here in August, so you could imagine how hot it was! Parking looked crazy because we did come on a Sunday, thank goodness our friend dropped us off. There were so many stores, we didn't even get to walk around the entire place because we were on a two hour time limit, due to our flight. I didn't buy anything for myself, but I saw a bunch of things that I could buy the BF so I just shopped for him. =) 

Though I didn't have enough time to explore the entire place, I enjoyed walking around and shopping for the boyfriend. Maybe next time I'll be in a mood to shop for myself."}
{"text":"Really great prices and selection! Bought so much stuff for so little! Make sure you don't drive in because the line to the parking lot takes 2+ hours (badly designed parking lot). Also, make sure to go to customer services to get a coupon book for out-of-towners. I got an extra $10 off something that was already cheap! Need to go back with an empty suitcase..."}
{"text":"There is a variety of good stores in this place...time to go shopping with your winnings, before you lose it all back!"}
{"text":"lotsa shops, lotsa good stuff. better than primm and the south premium outlets"}
{"text":"Among the outlets in Vegas this one is by far my favorite. It's an outdoor shopping center with a large range of mid-tier and high end designers. Burberry, L'Occitane En Provence, Le Sportsac, and 7 For All ManKind are a few of my must stop shops, but I often like to window shop at some of the really high end stores like Armani, Dolce and Gabbana, Hugo Boss, etc. There's so many stores here that you can definitely spend the day here! 

I highly recommend coming here right when the shops open (9am) to secure parking and enjoy all the neatly organized racks before all the tourists raid the shops. Also, wear comfortable shoes as you'll definitely be doing a lot of walking!"}
{"text":"I am never let down by this outlet mall! Coming from LA, Premium Outlets are always a treat. I usually get a massive haul once a year here and i'm pretty much set for a good while. Very convenient and easy to get to from The Strip. Don't forget to remember where you parked! It's a big parking lot. 

Favorite stores: 
- LOFT, Fossil, Kate Spade, Francesca's, The Beauty Space, Marc Jacobs, Adidas, and Gap, Saks Fifth Ave Off 5th, Steve Madden

Very clean and well laid out outlet mall. They also have a food court and Starbucks so you can fuel your shopping sessions."}
{"text":"So.. I go to Vegas to eat, watch shows, and SHOP! This is the best outlet shopping center that I've been to! There are a lot of high end/designer stores with reasonable prices.

If you go during the summer, I would highly recommend going early in the morning. The mist can only go so far. 

Parking is not a problem. If you are stranded, you can easily take a taxi."}
{"text":"There are 2 outlet centers in Las Vegas, the NORTH and the SOUTH.

I've been to both.  If you're from or familiar with Southern California, to compare I'd say the NORTH is similar to Camarillo or Palm Desert.

The SOUTH is similar to Ontario Mills or The Citadel.

The NORTH is an outdoor shopping area, it has more stores as well as higher end (brand names) stores.  The SOUTH for the most part is an indoor mall, and has a mixture, 'tho if I had to summarize, has more working class type retail stores.

Parking is difficult at the NORTH, they have a parking structure that's covered.   Parking seemed easy over at the SOUTH.

The shopping clientele seems be comprised of more visiting tourists (and foreign ethnic)  at the NORTH and more locals (and urban ethnic) at the SOUTH. 

I like the NORTH Premium Outlets, as a male shopper for:

Dolce & Gabbana (D&G)
Tumi
Lacoste 
Ferragamo
Coach (for Men)
Marc Ecko
Kenneth Cole

It's outdoors, so when it's hot, it's HOT... but the store are all air conditioned, so gives you good reason to visit the stores and browse."}
{"text":"Some sales rep are so rude and don't even wanna greet you really
look at you and see if they are interested in you 
I also found the Coach store very out of place needed some organization so far i have to admit it was crowded but it look trashy 
Michael Kors the ugliest customer service the reps were so  discriminating 
That is not customer service that just selfish service to provide themselves good commission and if you are not dress they will pass by you completely and not even smile
Bebe was a way better experience when I went they had good sales ,clean, friendly"}
{"text":"Yee! Premium outlets.  

I tend to just shop at Kate Spade and their staff is super friendly. Under Armour had some great deals ($17 for shirts), North Face had $50 fleece jackets and found some Oakley sunglasses for $70 with all the discounts. Plus Kate Spade was doing 60% off and it made buying handbags pretty attractive.

However, the expansion is not so great on the discounts. Walked into Tory Burch and there weren't really any deals worth taking. It was a bit of a bummer!"}
{"text":"I think it's better than the outlet on state line, prices seem cheaper and they have Porsche Design store one of 2 location outlets only in the U.S., really good deals a must visit when in Vegas it's at the end of the strip near downtown..."}
{"text":"got my bf to buy his first watch at kenneth cole. lots of good store there =]"}
{"text":"Found some damn good deals there with brand names that I like, so overall, this is a great outlet mall to visit.

Couple of caveats:

1.  The taxi line at the outlet is LONG.  Waiting in it can take way too long.  Do yourself a favor and either a) rent a car or b) learn to take the bus.

2.  Do not take your girl there unless you have the endurance for a 3-hour shopping excursion."}
{"text":"Fast alle Marken sind hier vertreten, die man sonst in den Malls findet. Nur zumindest teilweise massiv preiswerter!"}
{"text":"Selection here is good (they have well-known brands), but the prices aren't very competitive! Kind of defeats the purpose of an outlet mall. If I wanted to spend $80 on a shirt, I wouldn't bother coming here...I would buy it at home.

On the upside, it's a nice walk."}
{"text":"This is another place I must stop by when I visit Las Vegas. Yes there are Outlets in SoCal but this one is my favorite. It is worth driving the extra miles North on the 15 freeway pass the the Primm Valley Outlets and pass the Las Vegas strip to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets in the North to shop.

Start off with parking in the structure at one end of the Outlets so your car can keep cool in the shade. Use your AAA Card to pick up a coupon brochure from Guest Services to get additional discounts at selected stores. And \"Let the Shopping Begin!!\"

There are many brand name stores like Oakley, True Religion, Swarovski, Coach, Crabtree & Evelyn, Calvin Klein, Banana Republic, Michael Kors and much much more!! And a Starbucks for a break from the heat and hours of walking.

I would like to try coming here during the weekday. I imagine that it would not be as crowded as the weekend. 

Yes parking can be crazy. Yes there is crowds especially during holiday weekends. But the deals and shopping therapy from this Outlet deserves 5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I wanted to hit up the after Christmas sales. My husband told me there was an outlet close to the Vegas Strip. There are actually two outlets one is the South Outlets and one is the north Outlets. We ended up going to the north Outlets because I wanted to hit up Gymboree. The sales were great but the crowds were massive. The outlets are sprawled pretty widely. There was a Toys R Us, Disney Store, Auntie Anne's (where you can get a Groupon for). There were lines at the typical name brand purse stores like Kate Spade, MK, etc. 

We ended up going and purchasing a lot at Gymboree because of the good deal plus the addtional coupon on the coupon book.  you can get the coupon book at the customer service place. They charge $10 per coupon book book unless your AaA Member or part of the military-just show them ID. 

Parking was fast but crazy. They have people directing traffic, which helped a lot. Will I be back again? Probably not it's the same as any other outlets."}
{"text":"lot of stores that are higher-end. I found a few stores for my kids: Disney store, vans, children's place, but i didn't find many stores that sold everyday women's clothing, which I was mainly looking for. kinda bummed."}
{"text":"this place makes other outlets look hella WACK... i love love love this mall it has something for everybody....YES EVERYBODY!!!!"}
{"text":"Since I didn't party at Tao the night before I got an early start on my shopping.  One of my plans was go to check out this outlet since Caroline said they had a Ferragamo outlet and I wanted new sunglasses.  Since she said the sunglasses was just 100 bucks, hell yeah I was there.  Vil let me borrow her old car and I made my way to the outlets on my own.  Yes I got lost but I didn't mind getting lost it was fun.  When I got to the outlets I was impress by the stores they had.  Dolce and Gabana, Juicy Couture, BCBG just to name a few.  They had lots of stores I love.  I even texted my sister telling her she needs to shop here.  Overall one of the best outlets I been too.  Going to save my money and come back and shop."}
{"text":"This particularly outlet is located just north of the Las Vegas strip. The outlet has added a parking light indicator similar to the Cosmopolitan but I believe it is not fully functioning yet.

Of all the outlets I've been to so far, this place has the most variety of stores for my personal tastes. Some stores off the top of head were: Adidas, Nike, Puma, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole, Timberland, Nautica, Asics, Bose, Hugo Boss, Banana Republic, Starbucks, Merrill, Wilson's Leather, 7 for Mankind, etc."}
{"text":"The best Adidas outlet I've been to hands down. They have alot of other great spots and deals  UT Adidas was it for us this time. We had to buy extra luggage with all the deals we came across. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Most everyone has already done a thorough job of reviewing these outlets...so I'll keep this brief:

Pros:
Parking garage and security has a presence, convenient location, outdoors, great high end stores, clean, big

Cons:
Parking gets tight and backs up, elevators in garage are slow, when it's hot you'll work up a sweat getting from one store to the next

If you love shopping, definitely make a stop here on your next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't know were to start with this place. Don't come here if you are disable and try to find a parking spot. They have turned all the handicap spot into regular parking and closed off parking to even try to park close to accommodate the disable. When asked about it she shrugs her shoulders and was to park on the top floor where it's raining. When I tried to park close when a white couple was walking toward their car so I thought. They must have thought we were trying to rob them so they would walk in different directions so we couldn't park in there spot."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best outlets I've been to in a long time because when they say Premium, they truly mean premium! Some notable goodies are Diesels at 30% off outlet prices, True Religion jeans at $99! and great deals on kate spade shoes. I can't stress about how awesome this place is and if I had an unlimited budget I would probably buy all my wardrobe from here still because it's so much more accessories, shoes and clothes for your money!

The only downside is that the parking situation is terrible on a daily basis and in the summer its hot like crazy since its outdoors and in the winter its cold for the same reason. Otherwise outlet prices + Las Vegas tax = happy shopper!"}
{"text":"Between the North and South Premium Outlets, I preferred this one. The Las Vegas Premium Outlets (north) is a nice shopping place to get great deals. I was here way back when it was during Christmas time and boy...what sale after Christmas. I got a Coach bag here at a really, REALLY good proce. Then off course, I got ton of shirts and a pair of shoes here and plus the coach bag....ALL UNDER $80!!!! What a shopping spree at a bargain price! 

Overall, I loved coming here and I'll definitely be back to this place when I hit up Vegas again. ;)"}
{"text":"It's an outdoor shopping center and boy, it is not easy to shop here when the temperature is in the 100's!!!  They have misters but it really doesn't help when the sun is blazing and glaring down on you.  They  have a great selection of shops, but I personally have found better deals at the outlets at State Line.  Found amazing deals there on Kate Spade purses.  Oh yeah and the State Line shops are indoor with great air conditioning which is a plus!  :)"}
{"text":"Las Vegas Premium Outlets...you are so awesome. 
You are my favorite place to stop at when I'm at Vegas. 
I could spend hours just going around the different stores and browsing all the cool deals. There's just something for everyone here. 

It always seems to be crowded but yet there is room for everyone. We've never had a problem finding parking and we always are able to find the stores we want to go without too much hassle. It seems almost every store has cool deals. There are definitely good discounts compared to going to a mall. The discounts even sometimes get another percent off due to coupons the different places give away when you first enter. 

Oh and the great deals are not just in the big stores. There are also excellent deals to be found in the those boutique carts on the outside. I found some great crystal bracelets for a really good price in one of those carts! The only thing is it can be hard to browse to shop at those carts when you're under the hot sun, burning Vegas weather. Nonetheless there are deals to be found everywhere! 

I could go on and on about how awesome this place is and about all the cool stores but I'll let my detailed store reviews do the talking :). 

I'll end this review with the following: 

Las Vegas Premium Outlets. Truly AWESOME place!"}
{"text":"Not sure who the genius was to develop an outside mall when the temperature goes over 100 in the summer time.  This seems to be a popular place yet they didn't consider the right amount of parking spaces for the crowds that come here.  Every time I come, I find getting a parking space a real challenge even with multiple garages.  Meanwhile, the shopping center is humongous.  You will need a map, and even with that, you will get lost.  Every conceivable shop is here.  Not sure about the Outlet label since I really didn't see any real bargins here.  But if it's shopping you want to do, then you will be in heaven.  Eating here is limited, even bad, especially now that Makino is gone.  So eat before you get here, bring bottle water in the summer and bring your walking shoes."}
{"text":"Nice store, great prices. I will say this one person was rude and would recommend she treat her employees better ( or at least not in front of the customers).  I believe she was in charge or something because disrespectful towards the other girls and made rude comments.  One person called her Tina.  Other than that, I would recommend this store."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that the only two things I care about when I go to Vegas are gambling and eating. Because of this, maybe that's why I didn't really care for shopping, let alone shopping at the Outlets. With that in mind, maybe that's the reason for my A-OK rating.

We came on a Friday night. The place was desolate. Which I guess, that's a good thing since there isn't someone else there trying to snatch up that last item both of you were eying.

There were plenty of stores: shoes (such as Aldo, Nike, Crocs), clothing (Banana Republic, Columbia), accessories (Burberry, Kate Spade). This place seem to have it all.

And if you get hungry or in need of a drink, there is also a food court located in the Outlets. 

Be sure to bring your AAA card for additional discounts at select stores :)"}
{"text":"It's an open air mall, so you know it can get hot. Their solution to help cool you off? Mist. Pretty cool if you ask me, but if you are out there suntan lotion is probably a good idea. The girlfriend and her mom love this place and they love going through all their favorite stores and sales. It's a nice, clean, and spacious. Probably one pf the best places in Vegas to find a good value.

Parking wasn't too bad because we parked in the structure."}
{"text":"I have been to other outlets, like Carlsbad Company Outlet, Lake Elsinore, Citadel, Las Americas, and Ontario Mills. I would like to comment that this mall's architecture is not as appealing as the other outlet malls that I've aforementioned. However, it does seem to include all the usual factory outlets, like Nike, Gap, Banana Republic, Journeys, Vans, etc. Not missing much, but I did not enjoy the experience as much as in the other outlets."}
{"text":"Ok people, do your research. #1 the internet or phone service in this area sucks.  I needed it so that i can compare prices in the normal retail store vs. this outlet but i was able to get it to work using my verizon mifi. so here's the truth, these outlet stores mark up the prices so high and they have signs saying 20-60% off and in reality when you calculate it then it comes out to be the exact the same or higher than any department stores.  I went to UGG, Nike, Gucci, LV, Michael Kore, and other stores I can't remember and every one of them was a full of lie and bullshit.  Save your gas $$ and shop at your nearby Nordstrom, Macy's, etc and you will be happy with the results.  These kind of rip off and deceit should be illegal and punishable by law!!! 

If there were 0 starts i would give it 0 in addition to the nasty food court they have there."}
{"text":"Its like Waikele Outlet for all you local Hawaii people. Except the BEBE there has merchandise on sale for stuff that is regular priced at Ala Moana. 

+ You can smoke hookah while the ladies are shopping. Just find the hookah guy.

+ Armani had a $20 sale when we were there in February!"}
{"text":"Straight up fan. There are high end designers and mass market brands interspersed at this location. Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, Kate Spade, Tory Burch and Michael Kors rub elbows with Banana Republic, Sunglass Hut Chico's and White House Black Market. Way to cover your mass appeal bases. 

It is open air, keep that in mind during summer. You are able to peruse with water in hand, bring your own. While they do have vending machines, a Food Court filled with pseudo nutrition and carts offering variety (Sasapops, anyone?) it is not the best place to eat. 

For some reason, it had been a while since I'd been here but will be returning for sure. Like any other outlets, knowing your prices is key. Parking is a cluster, the signs have icons on them to remind you where you left your ride to avoid \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" moments after maxing out the plastic. 

FYI: some stores offer a Military Discount; Banana Republic @ 10%. Don't be afraid to ask. Our salesman told us when he overheard us talking about Nellis."}
{"text":"Love the outlet stores but have to pay $7.00 for self parking is ridiculous. I will have to curtail my shopping here."}
{"text":"One of the outlets in Vegas. There's a North and a South Premium outlet... I think I've never been to the south... always to this one.

This outlet has many store options like tumi, aldo, kat spade, micheal kors, etc.

We can here intended for me to find workout shoes in hopes it's cheaper than Hawaii. Didn't find shoes  but I ended up buying a purse from tumi's haha Didn't need another purse. Woops! 

This outlet mall has a weird shape, it's like a double square connected in the center. Seems big and has many stores. There's a cooling area where water sprays and many benches to sit outside if you're not feeling the shopping (hint you guys with the gf/wifey) these are helpful. Girls who shopped till they drop, no worries there's plenty benches to sit down and burn more paper."}
{"text":"I stop to shop here every other time I'm in Las Vegas so I guess a review is long over due.

Name brands. Discounted prices. 

Sizes are usually picked thru. Styles may be a little dated however there are deals to be found if you're lucky. My friend's favorite is the Coach Store. They're usually giving a coupon at the door. 

Makino's Buffet isn't too bad. 

Parking can be a pain."}
{"text":"I spent 5 hours here recently and was wondering how I could kill the time but I managed to go through the entire outlet in that time.  First stop was the Simon Guest Services to get your free VIP coupon book when you check in; otherwise it costs $10!  It has discounts for some of the stores and I was able to save $10 off at Charlotte Russe.  The bathroom facilities are very clean and there are plenty of places to sit if you need to rest.  Make sure you get a map of the stores at Simon Guest Services and plan out which stores you plan to visit before you start walking around.  It will save you time and energy if you visit the ones that are close by first and work your way around the entire area."}
{"text":"4.0- Did someone say outlets?  Why yes, I think I will.

Being Filipino, it is inherent that I look for a good deal.  Naturally outlets and I get along pretty well.  While I'm not the biggest shopper, and usually limit my trips to outlets to very specific stores (adidas, puma, some dressier shops) there are some outlets that don't have \"outlet prices.\"  Yeah, not a concern here.

What I also like about this outlet, is the selection of stuff at the stores I go to.  I found a really cool Filipino shirt at Adidas, and I found an Iron Man watch at a watch outlet for $25 (though, I opted to get a $12 one that was just as good).  Dress shirts seemed to be pretty decent buys, and I found a pair of \"nice\" cuff links for about $20 (best before that was about $30).

A good selection of stores, good prices, and an ok food court (hey, they got Orange Julius), if you want to do some affordable shopping off the strip, come check this place out."}
{"text":"$5 parking fees.  I will not go back to this outlet. Bad decision I give this outlet 6 months to feel the parking fees and 12 months for the outlet to become a ghost town. Vegas locals can make you and break you. Did you not learn from the last recession."}
{"text":"Throwing around the term \"premium\" pretty loosely. Its 92 degrees on a saturday. Parking is packed (The only positive about this place is the parking structure lights that indicate in green or red whether a stall is open). But both elevators  is out of service. Going up and down 4 flights of stairs in the mid day sun.... alright it's cool, let's burn off yesterday's lunch buffet. But then inside the complex it's under going renovations. Everyone is gridlocked like the strip on a friday night at 630pm, all the while you're trying to peak over divider tarps trying to navigate which shop you might want to peruse. On top of that, only one restroom is available and hard to find. Stores are alright, but not that much of any real bargains going on."}
{"text":"This outlet mall is a must place to go everytime we are in Vegas. Mostly tourist here. The outdoor outlet with all the branded company that you can think of. 
This time with the heat, it was nice to stay cool inside the stores.  

I always check out Kate Spade because I love their wallet and they've a good deals compare to online. And golf stuff shirt, short for my husband and some other brand. 

Well I came from huge country with gigantic malls and moved to Carson / Reno area which has nothing and I barely visit the mall in Reno so hell yeah time to get crazy here. 

Parking is free at the parking structure & be smart shopper then you'll find a very good or dead deals!"}
{"text":"11.29.13.

Grey Thursday/Black Friday deals? Yes please!!

There are two parking structures, there's really no difference other than they're on different entrances of the outlet mall; take your pick! If you are planning to go on a busy day because chances are they will both fill up quick!

The shops here have improved since the last time I had been here (5-10 years ago)...or perhaps my taste has also changed that much haha. Either way, there is a store for everyone here & prices/sales are usually reasonable/steals!!

I would def want to come back again for another infamous sale! I have to say the GT/BF deals were pretty amazing!!

{"text":"I have been to many Oakley outlet stores, but this one had so much of what I wanted I went back twice!  Pricing was terrific as it was a holiday weekend.  I was impressed with their selection and sizes. Something for everyone in my family including me"}
{"text":"The best outlets around. The merchandise is fantastic the selection is phenomenon. It's a great place for high end outlets . They have polo and Nike and a lot of high-end stores. They also have food. And the deals are fantastic. They also have clothing store for kids and adults. This was my first time visiting this group outlets and I was so impressed and it's very close to the strip. I would highly recommend paying a visit . But don't forget to take your credit cards because you'll spend a lot of money there."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy visiting the outlets when I'm in town for business or visiting my daughter. All of my favorite shops in one location! What more can anyone ask for."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this mall. One of my favorite malls in Las Vegas. Many stores, great deals on clothing such as Hurley, Volcom, Pac Sun, Nike, Bose, Under Armour, Adidas, Zumiez, Quiksilver, and many other stores. Hours are great and the mall is big."}
{"text":"This is the outlet that I prefer in the Vegas area. Some of my favorite stores are located here; Coach, Cosmetics Company Store, Pandora, and Kate Spade to name a few. I've been here a few times. It can get crowded so parking may take some time. We parked our car with the valet near the Brooks Brothers entrance. There's also a valet near The Cheesecake Factory. When we finished our shopping trip, we were in that area. The valet attendants were nice enough to bring our car over from the other valet entrance where we'd parked. Thanks! Also, this is an outdoor mall, and It gets hot while walking around so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Great place to shop. Has many of the name brand stores that most are looking for! Parking is great! Location is easy to find!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite outlets in the United States.  There are quite a few high-end brands, the selection is great, and their volume sales mean new stock comes in all the time.  It is also new and clean.

Parking is decent with 2 big structures and an open lot, and it is also accessible via public transportation.

The only drawback is that it can get uncomfortable during summer and winter, due to the fact that it is an outdoor mall."}
{"text":"Okay love the many different shops and on a pretty day with good weather its a fun place to be. Hate the parking! Drove around for 15 mins trying to park in tiny spaces with traffic running everywhere. Its like an ant brigade waiting in line to park. 

They do offer valet and perhaps that would be a better solution. Other wise I think I will stick to town Center and or the fashion show. Every mall is busy but this one takes the cake for the worst parking set up, ugh! Avoid in the hot months as the whole mall is outside."}
{"text":"Came here on a visit from Cali. Very boring. Prices are hardly at outlet prices. They should have some type of entertainment to take your mind off of the ridiculous heat. They have water misters everywhere and that really doesn't help me when its over 100 degrees between stores. I actually hated my experience in the frickn heat."}
{"text":"Outlet stores just aren't what they used to be. I remember back in the day you would go through racks ala TJ Maxx to find your bargain. Now, these outlets have made for outlets clothes of lesser quality. Sure, you might find a \"real\" higher quality name brand shirt but it is probably either stained or a 3XL. There are many high end stores here and it does get very busy on the weekends, especially on Saturday. If you want to save yourself the headache, get there right when they open. If you wait until mid day and expect to find parking, it isn't going to happen.  Some weekends are busier, like 3 day weekends and such. There is an ok sized food court with choices like Subway, a pizza place, a Japenese restaurant and a few others I can't remember. There are misting fans that are spread out along the way to cool you off since it is an outdoor mall. The South outlets are trying to compete with the North outlets now, and are starting to get higher end stores there. It will be less crowded at the South outlets because they used to be the Bel outlets and omg we're they ghetto before they were bought out. Some of the oddness remains of the South outlets but at least they are trying. The South outlets are indoors which is nice but can get busy on Sundays while people kill time before catching their flight. But, I was disappointed by some of the prices at the outlets. I went to the Adidas store to look for running shorts and they were $25 and up!  I can get a much better deal at Dicks Sporting Goods clearance racks. I want outlet prices back darn it!"}
{"text":"Really impressed on the wide range of store selections. Especially the higher end stores. Definitely will be back to do more shopping."}
{"text":"The reason that I like this outlet is that there is a Seiko Outlet here.  I talked to the employees.   There are about 14 Seiko Outlet in the US, but this is the only one in Nevada and Southern California area.  All the other stores are everywhere--nothing special."}
{"text":"One of the things we like to do on vacation is indulge in a little shopping, and Vegas is no exception! Since most of the time we like to stay downtown, the outlets are close to our hotel, so it's never out of the way.

There's a big variety of shops here, and you can find something for everyone. The prices here are pretty standard like most outlets, but there's more selection than the South Outlets.

The parking can sometimes get crazy, but trying to find an open stall is usually fast since they gave indication lights. Never took a taxi here, but it usually looks like there's a line? Which I don't quite understand in the age of Uber. Plus the taxi's line up too, waiting for customers, so again, don't know what the line is for.

The real drawback to this place is that it's outdoors. Like many other people know, LV has temperatures on each end of the spectrum. During winter it gets pretty cold, so it's not ideal. During the summer, its boiling! They have some mist sprays, but it doesn't help that much."}
{"text":"Recomendable al 100% y no olviden hacer su check-in para obtener una cuponera a mitad de precio, que es muy √∫til y aprovechas para ahorrarte unos dollares m√°s, todas las tiendas son muy buenas y en el √°rea de comida aunque hacen falta asientos, encuentras algo que te agrade. Visita y compara precios y trata de llevar ropa c√≥moda."}
{"text":"6/18/16
I wanted to check out the hype over Las Vegas Premium Outlets and see if it's really as great as I've been told. This is basically, a mall with mid-to-high end stores with discounts you generally will not see in the stores. 

This place is mostly and outdoor mall, which is awesome on a pretty day, not so much when it is blow dryer hot as Vegas gets, they do have misters situated around the shopping plaza. 

The food court is okay, nothing special, but this isn't the place to go when you want fine dining. All-and-all, not a bad outlet mall."}
{"text":"A variety of wonderful stores and amazing people to watch. Nike, under armor, asics, adidas, puma and reebok have great prices for sportswear. Feeling hungry? They got a chipotle and a spacious food court for those who love to eat.

Clothing? A bit pricey, no h & m here, but they have Calvin Klein, Columbia and polo here. No more Kenneth Cole as that was my go to for female attraction clothing. 

Auntie Anne's? Yup, incredibly delicious. 

Weather good? Nope. It's hot in the summer and the wind brushes against your face as you wither thru the narrow passageways. No more makino japanese sushi which is unfortunate.

Great place to ask a person out on a date? Nope, there are bars and strip pubs in vegas. Take a look at crazy horse 3 or sapphire. Prices are well rounded."}
{"text":"Two Words: JECKYLL AND HYDE. 

JECKYLL: The stores here are all nice and organized. Walking around, the clean up crew does a good job keeping the the grounds spotless. The food court is decent and thankfully inside where it is air conditioned.

HYDE: The number one reason I am not too crazy about going to this place and im sure that EVERYBODY that shops here will agree with me is that THE PARKING SUCKS! Every time I go here it takes forever to find a parking spot. When you do find one, it's usually between a huge SUV and a hooptie. Forget the fact that the stalls are small to begin with, the chances that you will have a ding or two on your car is higher than finding the lost city of Atlantis. With all the business they do here you would think they can add at least another 3 levels on their parking structures or least put more structures on their open lots. The South Premium Outlet has a better advantage because parking is a little bit better and thank GOD it's an actual shopping mall with air conditioning."}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE disappointment for my mom and I 

I'm unsure why they call it \"premium\" because there wasn't anything special or wonderful about this place.  They had mostly out of date brands or stores that made items exclusively for outlets.  They also had some designer stores but very limited products or nothing worth getting.  I've been to premium outlets in California and these were short from those.  

Another major complaint was the innovation that was taking place.  It was hard to walk around to stores because a lot of the walk way was blocked off.  It was frustrating.  Also convenient restrooms were nowhere to be found.  You have to walk a ways to get to one.  Their food court was chaos.  There were way too many people just hanging out.  Forget going to Starbucks, their line was out the door and it was teeny tiny inside.  I won't even mention the fact that this is an outdoor mall in Vegas temperatures.  Parking was also terrible.   

We both left with nothing, which is very rare.  For us, it was not worth going here.  We probably will never come back."}
{"text":"Honestly not a huge fan of shopping, but if it needs to be done then this is a pretty good place.

These outlets are \"outdoors\" so it can be really hot at certain parts of the year and then at other times it can be cold and windy. I've been at both times and I wanted to leave pretty quickly (because I hate shopping), but we had specific items in mind and we were able to go and find what we wanted pretty quickly with the large selection they have here."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this mall!  Unless you are here for something specific, be prepared to spend hours here!  =)  They've practically got every store you can think of.  Lol. Well almost all.  They've got an awesome all-you-can-eat seafood and sushi restaurant (Makino) here too!

Always a must when I'm in the shopping mood here in Vegas!

PS: parking garage is adjacent to the mall and valet is available as well."}
{"text":"I know the design of this place is meant to be outdoors and fashionable.. but seriously Summer Vegas weather is not ideal for this place.  Aside from it being outdoors this place by far hosts the best outlets in Vegas., Very very diverse and reasonable. Design of the outlet kind of stinks but the shops are well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the better outlets I've ever been to. It was first time visiting and a bit confused about the layout of the place - primarily the parking structure but thank goodness for Google maps! 

The one thing I like about the LVO is the fact that they have cheesecake factory and it's located at the end of the stores. Actually, the stores are located in an oval, so if you park in the parking structure, you will exit outlets the same way you came in. 

The stores here were pretty impressive and definitely better than the Primm outlets. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"omg it's like everything is inside the circle and you drive around the outside as long as you can until you finally find somewhere to park or figure out if you go into the parking garage and walk into the center you'll find a great selection of stores! The stores, the food, everything is great inside, but getting inside is the pain. Also, you see the Nike outlet sign but you can't park by it, so you drive around the entire ....structure, and can't find parking - knowing you don't want to park in that huge garage because that is real far from the Nike store .. ugh .. maybe the valet was the way to go. Other the design flaws, the stores are great :) you should visit this mall if you can stand it. lol"}
{"text":"The best thing about this outlet center is that it is indoors and rain or heat wave, you can still shop comfortably.  The selection could have been better."}
{"text":"Out of the two outlets here in Vegas, this is my favorite one. Even though I'm closer to the South outlet, I'd still prefer to come to this one. 

This outlet is the higher end of the two. The other outlet has higher end shops as well, but not as many as this one. This outlet has shops like Kate Spade, Tahari, True Religion, J. Crew and Tory Burch. They do still have the more affordable and typical stores an outlet would have, like Levi's, Nike and Coach. When the weather is nicer in the springtime, it's awesome to just come out here and enjoy the warm weather while shopping. 

Cons: the parking is aweful!! This is a huge destination spot so you are fighting for parking with the tourists and the 2000+ employees. The parking garage isn't completed yet, so hopefully it'll get better. The heat during summer can be unbearable and this is when people go to the South outlets since they are indoors. Lastly, their food court is pretty lame. Nothing is appealing and there are only 5 or 6 options to choose from. Although there are little snacks spots around the outlet, like ice cream and pretzels. Solid spot to shop!"}
{"text":"1 star for some cool stores other Premium outlets don't have.
1 star for the water misters throughout the area for cooling down on a hot hot day!
That's it...other than that the Desert Premium Outlet is soOoo much better!
I got way better deal on cosmetics (ie. lancome lotion I got for $14.99 at the Desert was $28 here) and the selections in the stores were better.
My friends also told me that you can get some better deals at the Fashion Show mall."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical premium outlet mall except that it's so hot your skin will melt off. (No seriously it will) It has all my favorite stores: Coach, A/X, Kenneth Cole and Banana Republic. There are some good deals in here but a lot of stores only knock off about 20% which isn't much. Either way I always come here when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"New parking garage is about to open... It's about time!

I love this mall - worked here for 2 years, lived only 15 min away. This was my go-to mall even on a day off, I could always find whatever I needed.  Just be sure to get here early, the tourists are amped and ready to go BEFORE the mall even opens. Parking can be beyond awful so again, get there first thing in the AM or about 1-2 hours before closing (if you know you'll be quick, the stores do not stay open for late shoppers).  

I'm so happy to see the 3rd parking garage finally opening. It was in the works since day 1 of working there (3 years ago!). Holiday's are brutal, beware! I head to the top floor of garages, but note that it will take forever ... allow 45 minutes for parking at prime rush times.

The food court is so-so but I love the Asian restaurant NOT in the food court, they serve beer! Men will love that! Their lunch boxes are cheap-cheap-cheap and enough to share for 2.

Pick up a coupon booklet at the info center (where the cabs drop off/pick up) - they are usually $5 unless you have a military ID, AAA card, etc.  Totally worth it, 90% of the stores are in there.

Once you are done wandering this mall (you'll need half a day) head south to those outlets, different stores for the most part and it's really growing."}
{"text":"I like this outlet because they have a great Makino sushi buffet in there. Other then that most of the store are still not open yet. 
I'm not sure why they call this place as outlet because everything is not cheap. I mean I'm from S. FL, and when I go to outlet in Sawgress, Orlando premium outlet everything is good price. But in Vegas outlet. Their price is as high as normal department store. 
Don't expected to find something cheap here."}
{"text":"I don't know what's worse...parking at Paragon or parking at LVPO...well...maybe Paragon wins the \"better parking\" award...only b/c if they run out of actual parking spaces...there's a dirt road conveniently located across the parking lot for you to park your car haha...

Anyway, everytime I'm in town, this is my go-to place to shop...I almost never leave this place without a shopping bag in my hand...haha

Came here for the \"Day After\" Christmas sale...I didn't know they had opened at 0700 that morning--we arrived around 0900, but were very lucky to find parking in the garage which was good...there were a lot of people, but it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded...YET... 

Went to a lot of stores, but didn't really buy anything only b/c my heart was set on buying a purse either from Tory Burch or Kate Spade...Kate Spade was a win...60% off (on top of that, selected items, which there were many of, were 40-50% off in addition to the 60%)...I got a cute black crossbody with a matching wallet...all for $159 with taxes already included...I say that's pretty damn reasonable given that the purse was originally $250+ and the wallet itself was $100+...of course mom bought a purse and a wallet to go with it as well...our total came to $237...not bad at all!  What's even better? The fact that we came at the most perfect time b/c after an hour or so the line was out the door...not just out the door...out the door, stretching towards the parking lot...wtf??haha

Speaking of lines out the door...mid lunch time, hoards and hoards of people started coming in...tell me how I couldn't get into Tory Burch...one line was for the people  waiting to get into the store...and the second line was for people to get into the first line to get into the store...like seriously??  As much as I wanted a purse from there so bad...I had better things to do with my time...like eat...that's always good yes? haha...

Anyway, definately do come here especially if you're one that likes to shop...but again, make time for parking cuz it is a bizznatch out here haha...it gets so bad to the point security can't even handle it...lol"}
{"text":"Large outdoor outlet.  There is a food court and starbucks and prices seem good.

Fun place to shop while in vegas.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place has a telephone number, which would lead one to believe that they actually answer the phone. However, after having called six times over three days, I can confirm that is not the case. Why do you not answer the phone, Tory burch outlets of Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"One of the best outlet malls I've ever been to in the country, and I've been to a lot. They have your typical designer outlet stores (Coach, Juicy, True Religion, Ralph Lauren, etc), but they also have specialty stores and outlets that are very hard to find (Burberry, Dooney and Bourke).
This is definitely s must stop in Vegas. It's close to the strip, but far enough that you're out of the hustle and bustle of the strip. My advice would be to hit it up on a weekday as the weekends are so crowded some of the parking garages are full by 11:00 am."}
{"text":"Small walk ways & not enough food court options. Parking would be better if it were more centrally located. Noticed that it seemed to be a place to hang out for visitors before they head to the airport because several people were there with luggage."}
{"text":"Honestly, like most outlets, the prices really aren't that big of a difference. I've found the only times it's cheaper at outlets is when the specific store was having a sale themselves. I know this outlet has been around for a while, but it still looks and feels new/clean. The only problem, they have these fans that are supposed to cool you down with misters, but the dang mist always gets blown by the wind, meaning, no cooling down. Efff the heat. Effff it I say!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite outlets in Vegas. It's a bit north of the strip, but not too far. It is an outdoor mall and reminds me of the Citadel in L.A. 

My favorite stores are Coach, Victoria's Secret, Nike outlet, and the Perfume store. I can never leave without buying something. 

The parking structure is a great plus here."}
{"text":"They need to have more misters up. On the hot days. I do come here everytime we come to Vegas"}
{"text":"good selection. parking gets tough but they also have a garage."}
{"text":"I've been to better malls but I enjoy shopping here on occasions. I cant stand going places that are way too packed, so i try to beat the crowd and I always try getting there in the morning around 10am... no traffic, not as many people and not having to deal with people and their \"random stop disorder\" (if you're going to stop, at least move out of the way people!!!) and after shopping you can go someplace else to eat since the food court is such a rip off.  But while I'm there, I always have to go into the coach store... I love the deals they have there sometimes! I like other stores too, but my main reason for coming here is for coach and oakley :) I kinda wish they had more stores though... I mean, yeah sure they have plenty of stores, but half of those stores don't get my attention."}
{"text":"There so much shops here from Prada to Payless shoes and everything in between. There lot of food as well Ice-cream and lemonade. Lots of clean bathrooms with changing stations. One bad thing is there no free wifi."}
{"text":"I really like this outlet. There's a good number of stores that I like and it has a mix of high and med end brands. Some of my favs are Kate Spade, Tory Burch, Cole Haan, Polo, Gap, Banana, Zales, Aerosoles, and Ann Taylor. When the weather is nice it's a great place to walk around for a few hours. If you're going in the winter definitely bring a heavy jacket because it gets really cold and windy.

There's a few casual eateries and a Starbucks; perfect for staying energized during long shopping trips. I love that parking is free and it's a pretty big structure. I only wish it was closer to the strip since I don't often have access to a car when I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"lots of shopping came to buy things

dodged asian tourist to get to stores

spent money - would do again"}
{"text":"It was a cold and stormy night. No, seriously, it was! On Sunday, the last day of our Vegas trip, the thunderstorm happened and it happened while I was at the outlets. So many wonderful options at this location! Bought stuff at the Disney Store, BR, and White House | Black Market. If it wasn't for the downpour, I would've shopped more. They have a great selection of retailers...even one that carries the out of stock items from Disneyland itself! (I can vouch for it since I've seen those merchandise items before on a monthly basis at Disneyland.)"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get to the top of one parking garage so that I could turn around and drive back out.   

I never got to set foot in the outlet mall. 

After 40 minutes of driving in circles without finding parking, I turned around and went back to my hotel.  Obviously they don't feel the need to ensure there's adequate parking...  I don't feel the need to give them my money.

I doubt I will ever attempt to shop here again."}
{"text":"Went to the premium outlet mall today to grab a couple of pair of jeans.  The shopping is similar to the last time I visited this mall.  Sale, Sale, Sale, is the theme and given; it's an outlet mall.  I love the store selection at this mall.  When you can visit brands like Cut & Sew, Ferragamo, Guess, Polo, etc and save money you can count me in.

The mall is heavily saturated with tourists from the strip.  Most locals would probably vote that as a big negative along with the lack of food and restaurants available.  Also, don't even consider getting a coffee at starbucks; the location is always slammed.

The new parking garage is also a plus even with the congestion at times.  Overall, the shopping mall is great when you have time to walk around  and your looking for different selections than Town Square and the Outlet mall offer."}
{"text":"I love this outlet place.  It's kind of between downtown and the Strip, and not exactly in the greatest area, but I love it anyways.  One of the few outlets I've been to where the stores actually do have worthwhile sales and there are a lot of fantastic stores to choose from (from Ferragamo to Brooks Brothers).

In the year that I've been here in Vegas, I've got to admit that I've never had great luck with any Brooks Brothers stores except this one where you can actually get a dress $150 dress shirt for $40 if you hit the right sale.

Absolutely love this outlet area.   Have recommended it to all of my friends and family that visit.  Oh, and there's a Starbucks right in the middle in case you need to wind back up for more shopping needs."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a place! 
Be sure to stop here when in town. 
Busy, lots of shoppers but also,  tons of great stores.
I'm happy I stopped in!"}
{"text":"Outdoor mall. Many stores. Nice and sunny. Good for me. Not good for my wallet. Have been here a few times on separate trips to Vegas, and I've found stuff here each time.

Food there is so-so though. Took a taxi here one time from our hotel on the strip and it wasn't too expensive. Needless to say, a pretty short drive from the strip for those who are driving."}
{"text":"Nice. I liked this mall. Not crowded and stores were full of merchandise. Clean and has a lot of brands. The BRepublic guy was very helpful same as the Sunglas Hut. The MK are not willing to help but the store has good merchandise. The Asics store has regular priced items."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of outlets in my day. This one is pretty good and was open on Christmas Day. However I wish that they would have advertised that not all stores are open on Christmas! Quite a few were closed.

The parking garage is a little crazy so I would drive with caution."}
{"text":"I only go there for lululemon outlet. Should go there friday since they are expecting so many people shop there on weekends, they have so many selections on friday."}
{"text":"Sales people were horrible in most stores and they wouldn't honor coupons that I bought at customer service. 

Katie was great at Max Studio."}
{"text":"Parking Sucks! Horribly unorganized parking structure with rows unnecessarily blocked off!  Cars just driving around and around! Very frustrating"}
{"text":"Of the two outlets in Las Vegas, this is definitely my favorite.
It has many great stores, current fashion and for the most part filled with friendly employees.

I seem to end up here when people are visiting, they want to go check it out since it is so close. It is usually super crowded on the weekends, so if you can plan a week day visit it is easier to navigate through, parking, etc. 

If you are willing to deal with th crowds, here is the secret, all of the stores have the deepest discounts on the Holiday weekends! YES, it will be crazy, but I have gone a couple times and saved BIG TIME!

Regardless of when I have been, I end up with 2-3 bags of great deals, or some good basics that are needed."}
{"text":"This outlet has a lot to offer.  They have Kate Spade, Marc Jacobs, Burberry, Loft, Ann Taylor, Black & White, Max Studio store which pretty much cover my favorite stores.

I went with 6 friends who are shopaholics and I'm sure you can imagine how that went. Left us with little storage trunk space.

We came here on a week day during opening hours so it was not crowded.  I also glad we got first pick on most of the stores.  

This outlet is clean, My only complaint is parking is far from the stores."}
{"text":"Great outlet stores! Especially coach, white house-black market, and Disney store."}
{"text":"I've always managed to waste some money and find something to stuff my overstuff suitcase with here.  It helps that there is shuttle service from a lot of the major hotels here.  Even if I haven't ever used it.  It does get a little crowded during peak travel time, but hey, if you're in Vegas for more than a couple of days and are realizing that you're running out of things to do on the strip, the outlets are just as good a place as any to burn some time and money."}
{"text":"Great shopping good bargains and we were able to use the military discount!!  Mainly shoes shopping today.  The one change I would make is a place to really recycle . those of us traveling do not need boxes to add to our luggage so placing boxes in the trash bins outside the store is not cool"}
{"text":"Okay so it's Monday night 8pm, we should had left from Vegas hours ago and I knew we weren't going to make it to the Coach outlet store in Barstow, luckily my little brother told me about this place, it's much bigger then the Barstow outlet store and double the merchandise. I got my coach fix of two new purses for under $140.00, as always I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Great outdoor outlet mall. Great shops and prices generally speaking. I was less impressed with Juicy Couture, Nike, and Burberry. But Polo, Coach, and Dooney were pretty good pplaces to hit. I would come back but do get there early. I aws there at 10:30am and parking was already getting limited."}
{"text":"Great for a deal, always.  Some items last season.  Worth the trip, always go to the North, the South Premium outlets is nowhere near as good."}
{"text":"Yes, this is an outdoor mall and that can be tricky with the Vegas heat, cold, wind, and rain, but if you want to have a bit more elbow room to fight off the crazy tourists, I would say this is a better location than the South Outlets. 
It is a bit high end, but they do have good deals at most places. Just have to be there at the right time. 
It was a bit of a maze so make sure to grab one of the maps that all the tourists had to better navigate the place.
I did see mall security a few times during my recent visit so that was a bit comforting.
Not too much as far as dining options besides the food court so eat before or after or otherwise a pretzel may be your top option."}
{"text":"Cool outlets a mile from Fremont street.  Lots of premium stores but also plenty of stores that you can afford as well.  The outlets were just about complete with the addition of several more stores and restaurants including Off Sax and Cheesecake Factory.  There is a large parking garage and a taxi and bus pick up drop off area as well.  One note the outlets are outdoors so get there early if you want to avoid the blistering summer heat."}
{"text":"Compared to the Outlets on S Las Vegas Boulevard, this one has problems. Logistics aren't as good. It's outdoors, not a problem except on rainy days. Like today, yesterday, and the day before. No, I'm not made of sugar.

There are many stores with locations both here, and in the S Las Vegas Blvd version, and the stores on the south side have better inventory, and often, more experienced employees. Parking is across the street, but the parking garage confuses people and they get lost, as the driving patterns are changed and where to go is non-obvious. If I was pressed for time, I'd go to the one on the south side. Better overall, there."}
{"text":"If you have to choose between south outlets and north outlets, this is the place to be. Awesome selection of vendors from watch station all the way up to Armani outlet. All can be had at a good discount of at least 40%. I enjoy shopping the sales here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pay to get your car window busted out and car out luggage stolen. Would give 0 stars, if I could. Pay $5 to park and we were gone less than 1 hour in the middle of the day. Crowded. Bad bad bad experience -- welcome to Vegas ...."}
{"text":"My parents were ashamed of me when I was born, \"We think he got the waterhead from Diego senior's uncle Pietro,\" they would often tell friends.
How fucked is that?
Back then, people didn't use PC terms like 'Hydrocephalic', no, they used the more caustic, 'waterhead'.
Actually, as it turned out I wasn't a waterhead baby at all. I just had (have) a large cranial area. One that requires extra large sunglasses. And that brings us to Vegas.

Well guess what. 
Few places carry the elusive 62mm Ray Ban Aviators save for the Sunglass Hut at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets. 
I now have a pair of sunglasses so big, they manage to conceal:

 * Unibrow nubbins ( non-shave days)
 * Bloodshot eyes
 * Suitcases
 * Cleavage gawking
 * Dozing at company events
 * Skunk-eye
 * Crow's feet (maybe Eagle's by some standards)
 * Missing pupils (mine don't just dilate, they expand to the same size as Jupiter
 * Missing eyelashes (never grew back after last year's Labor Day Barbeque)
 * Welling up at the end of Dirty Dancing

I also get my 501's here. They have odd sizes in all fashions. 
I have \"Hydrobooty\" too. 
My parents called it a bubble-butt. I never liked them."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas nothing is free, not even parking. Nevada residents with valid ID may park for free others are 5$. 5$ to park your own car to shop around. That was honestly disappointing showing up and having to pay 5$ but hey it's Vegas right? There aren't jaw dropping deals here. The sales are average but this place does have high end stores like Burberry, Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, and a few more. But like I said there aren't great deals but I mean hey a $100 off a Burberry bag is a $100 off. Better than nothing. Overall cool experience with many shops. You can get lost easily and walk around in circles. I also like how this outlet has fans that spray water on you while you walk because that Vegas sun is HOT."}
{"text":"If you're down with rocking last years style, wallet-conscious and enjoy a good parking garage rage session, welcome to the motherload! There are great brand-name stores here and deals are easy to come by. The layout itself is easy to navigate and the place is always clean. Plus, some stores have multiple locations, so you can catch 'em on either side of the Outlets (unless I'm seeing double). Hungry? There's an AYCE Asian buffet (Makino) and a food court. The perfect spots to hang while your other half does his/her thang. Know this, the parking STINKS. I've had better luck in the southern most lot, but that wasn't the greatest experience either. Prepare to spend an extra 15min getting in."}
{"text":"If your looking to shop this would be the place prices are slightly cheaper than the norm. Outdoor malls are not my fav but it'll do . Also they have cheese cake factory and other food vendors!"}
{"text":"Fun outlet! Decent amount of stores. Was excited to see Kate Spade there and all the stores are in close proximity of each other which makes walking easy. Kind of a weak food court though."}
{"text":"nothing amazing, It's like any other outlets around my area (socal)
lost of walking space. Only plus is seeing tourist lol."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I only come here during Black Friday since it's apparently a tradition to come to Vegas during Thanksgiving.

The stores here are pretty decent, I'll tell you that.  There's the \"high-end\" outlets like Burberry, Juicy Couture, Lactose, etc. but when you go in there, you might be a little disappointed.  There would only be a handful of items that are worth it but thing is there's only XXL.  I guess I can make a name brand tent out of it.  
Window display is lacking in all stores apparently.  
Food court is a joke.  How am I suppose to fuel myself from all this shopping?
Restrooms? Where? It's like trying to find a secret room.

Parking is pretty good here.  There's more than enough parking but the parking security are major douches.  They were controlling who gets which parking spot when a car pulls out and when they get it wrong they don't care and piss the hell out of you. 

It's not bad.  Not great either but then again I haven't been to an outlet that I loved before.   Good variety of shops."}
{"text":"Not a bad outlet mall with some good deals. Overall good selection of stores at varying price ranges. I really wish they had a Michael Kors outlet that just sold clothing!

Be prepared for the following with your visit: a) Waiting in line and/or fighting off hoards of Asian tourists at Coach, Michael Kors and Tory Burch. b) It will be hot and there is limited shade. c) Get your Starbucks before coming here. There are limited places to eat and one Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is a great mall when the weather is nice.  Great stores!  Sadly it's all ourside so in the really hot weather it is miserable!"}
{"text":"OMG! Vegas the unofficial \"ninth island\"as we locals like to call it!! For me is also my shopping heaven!

As soon as I stepped foot on the grounds of the outlets, my heart skip a beat for pure happiness and yet sank shortly after because I did not have enough luggage space!!!

This outlet is so amazing!!! So many famous and high-end brands at half the cost!  Was super excited to get some new Tory Burch flats and the cutest side bag from Vince Camuto! Let's just say I left there very very happy.  A grin from ear to ear!  As much walking done and excitement it was to shop, sometimes you tend to forget the Vegas heat!  There isn't much shaded areas but the welcoming cooling AC entering the store makes you forget about the heat again! Much H2O needed when coming, so make sure you got yours! 

Big Tip: Wear comfy shoes and cool clothes! 

As for food, they have a small food court and vendors through the stores. The food court can get very busy through the day.  Luckily, my girlfriends and I decided to eat at a nearby cafe.  More healthier choices and intimate setting to dine and chit chat."}
{"text":"I come here to see the people that I know since I used to work in 3 different stores here. But everything else, I don't really feel safe about this mall no matter how much security and cops they put on patrol here.

Robberies and shoplifting is frequent. And I have seen the stall vendors get into altercations with random kids, you know, wannabe gangbangers that wanna earn their stripes.

I have also seen taxi drivers fight over parking spots, and a incident between a bus driver and a cab driver because the cabbie is parked on bus property that was meant to unload passengers. 

The people that go to this mall are the most inconsiderate drivers ever. They would rather hold up traffic in a parking garage stretching 20 cars, just so they can take a spot on the lower levels instead of just driving all the way to the top. Fights break out in the garages too.

Most of these problems are caused by LOCALS, not the tourists. The locals that come here start the drama, and the tourists either are driven away by it or see it as mild entertainment.

For those that are complaining about the \"deceptive pricing\", I will tell you this... Prices for outlet goods are decided by the BRAND, not the mall! For example, Coach Factory Outlet bags are considerably cheaper than their full price counterparts. However, Michael Kors Outlet often have similar price tags to their full price cousins, although the silhouettes are actually completely different. That means that depending on the brand, you can either get a actual discount  from a \"transfer\" item, or... You could actually be buying a entirely different product from the same company.

For each brand there are often at least three categories, Full Price (Boutiques), Outlet, and Department Store (Nordstroms, Neiman Marcus, Macy's). Boutiques are pretty obvious. But for Outlets, which could be a entirely different part of the company, they MAY get transfers from full price stores, which will get marked down. Otherwise Outlets will have their own collection to sell."}
{"text":"This is the REAL Las Vegas Outlet! There are a few other lame run down outlets in the Las Vegas area, but make sure you go to this one, LAS VEGAS PREMIUM OUTLET!

Who says there's nothing to do but gamble in Vegas? I personally hate shopping maybe it's a guy thing, but I hate looking at the same crap that's  never on sale. This outlet is great for men! I'm not into men if that's what you were thinking (that's what he said). Let me explain. Most malls are composed of 95% womens products. This is no joke! And the 5% of stores that are not women's I am counting the food court and gift shops that don't even sell clothing. I admit malls are great for guys to go window shopping for eye candy (go on ladies do your thang), but if you want some decent clothes there is no mens clothing! This outlet actually has stores that men will  shop at! Also, unisex clothing stores have a men's section and not just on rack hidden in the back of a women's store. There's nothing more embarrassing than wondering if something is your size and it turns out to be womens clothing. That's a nightmare for a straight guy. 

Van Heusen, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Nautica, Calvin Klein, Keith Cole, TIMBERLAND!! One of the last Timberland stores open. Other outlets will only have a few big names and no section, but the premium outlets have what you are looking for. There's too much good stuff! Usually, I only get halfway through the outlet because I have bought too much stuff before I make it all the way through. 

If you are going to shop for reals, the Las Vegas Premium Outlets is for you. If you just want to look around, still go... but you should buy something because the prices are awesome. This is a must stop everytime you go to Las Vegas. The only bad thing is you may freeze your ass off in the winter and you will melt like a ice cream in the summertime, because this is an outdoor mall. I still don't get what the designers of this mall were thinking! Outdoor mall in Vegas?

{"text":"So many better stores than the local outlets in my area.  This place is always clean and easy to find parking generally."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lots of stores. You find things you usually don't find in our beautiful Colorado since we don't have lots of st."}
{"text":"When I was at the LV North Outlet, the first thing I checked out was the directory so I would know which unique and rare stores I should visit. This outlet has most of the common outlet shops like coach, Nike, bcbg, nine west, DC shoes, converse, etc. Yeah so I skipped all those.  In the one hour that I had, I spent 45 mins at the l'occitane store and 15 mins at the Diesel store.  Wise choice.  I got the best deal ever at l'occitane!!! If you went to their regular store before, you would know that their stuff ain't cheap.  A shower gel normally costs $30, a 1 Oz.  Eye cream can be up to $100... A 0.5 oz hand cream costs more than $10. But guess what,  I bought a travel pack that normally costs $55 for only $32 which includes a shea butter soap, a lavender soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower cream, hand cream and foot cream all fit into a l'occitane clear plastic pouch nicely wrapped and placed in a beautiful and colorful l'occitane gift box! I couldn't wait to use everything when I got home. I bought 2 of these gift sets and a facial cooling mist for $9.60. I got a 10% off discount that day too of my entire purchase so my total came to $66. They gave out a free shower gel of $30 value to customers who shopped for $65 or more. So, my total bill was only $71 and I was taking home two gift sets, a cooling mist for face and a big bottle of rose shower gel. I looked at my shopping bag. I could not believe what I just bought. My friend later came to check out what I got after we went our separate ways. She spent 1 minute in the store getting the exact same stuff I got because that was the best deal I've found after spending 45 mins there! The staff were helpful and did recommend a lot of things, but I really didn't care for the shower products. There are not many l'occitane outlets in the U.S. If you are in Vegas and if you like this brand, this is the shop you must visit.

Another store. Diesel. I like a lot of stuff from Diesel. It's not your common American store because Diesel is indeed an Italian brand so it's not surprising that the outlet is not easily found in every outlet. Of course I was going to check it out! I was a bit disappointed that their women section fell short. If you're a guy, this is certainly a good place to do some shopping for stylish clothing. They have men's t-shirts for only $18, reduced from the original $55 markup, can you believe that!? I saw a bunch of Italian tourists in this store, duh...

The outlet has a lot of stores to choose from. It's big. Plan ahead and wear comfortable shoes! Shame on you if you walk out this outlet with anything that is full-priced!

I love the l'occitane outlet..."}
{"text":"If in Vegas and you have an itch to shop, definitely one of the better stops. Just won a load of cash? Spend it here!

A good selection of stores to choose from, and decent inventory. Plus outlet prices. Not a bad shopping location"}
{"text":"I had a great shopping experience at this outlet! Everything was affordable and so many sale! DONT GO TO THE ONEILL STORE!!! Rude ass people! I would not step foot in that place again! Rude girl with short hair! She should be fired! And another Caucasian hillbilly coworker cracking jokes and laughing at the customers! Bad bad customer service!!!! Besides that, all the other places were super friendly and great way to shop before the holidays!"}
{"text":"I'm sort of a fan, but I wish they had a few more of the greats at this location. The other premium outlets across the country have some good deals. But this location is so close to the strip, not many fabulous bargains as one would expect. But it's cool."}
{"text":"I like the outlets in the fact that you can literally go in to the exact store you want and leave! And if its planned perfectly you can even park to where it's a direct shot to the store you want to shop at! Like any other mall try to avoid the obvious peak times such as the weekend and afternoons! It's most definitely a tourist trap for sure! I prefer to go to town square but if you want some good deals then this is your mall! Don't expect all of the normal designers stores like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada etc you gotta go to Crystals or Fashion Show! Other than that great outdoor mall!"}
{"text":"I love this mall but I was driving around looking for parking for 30 minutes. I couldn't find anywhere to park so I ended up leaving. I learned my lesson not to go on Saturday."}
{"text":"Don't go to the outlet all tourist have to pay a $5.00 for parking that's a rip off. Before it was free now Vegas is getting greedy all the casinos you have to pay for parking. Now this outlet is getting greedy better go to the outlet by the airport free parking. All the people from Hawaii we stay close to the greedy outlet before or after you get to the airport stop by the Las Vegas outlet by the airport and whatever you want the deals are as good or better than the one by the Cal and Mainstreet ! So what do you think should we pay $5.00 for that outlet outside of downtown Vegas?"}
{"text":"Love my 6 pair of tennis shoes from the Nike factory^ thank you friendly staff^great deals^always stay packed up in there..lol!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible horrible. Parking is just horrible and especially the food court. I bought pizza from Villa and customer service is ridiculous. They look like they're mad at the freaking world. Cashier girl especially looked like she didn't want to be there and she had a really rude attitude. I mean, isn't customer service suppose to be about attending their customers with kindness. That's pretty much what upset me. My boyfriend as well had a horrible experience with the food court. Besides the food court, I love the prices at SOME stores. I would give this mall a five star rating but customer service is poor."}
{"text":"Good prices and just about everything is 50% off. The store was well lit so I didn't feel I was getting slightly defected clothes like some outlets offer, the Employees were friendly and very helpful, and best of all short lines! Only minus 1 star for lack of selection compared to online!"}
{"text":"These outlets are the best, all kinds of designers have their outlets here. They had a Wilson's leather outlet, and nice and very resonably priced, great place to stop at either on your way into or out of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A pretty good outlet with all the essentials but lacking kitchen essentials.

The parking garage here is horrible and getting in and out of it a challenge in itself. It took us 20 minutes just to get out of the parking garage.  It didn't help that we were there during the holidays, but we came out with the good deals."}
{"text":"These days, I find myself getting more and more disillusioned with outlet shopping. The merchandise is only so-so and you can get better deals at the mall. In fact, a lot of the stuff is made for the outlets which to me, defeats the purpose. 

I guess not everyone feels this way because there were TONS of people! What recession?! Between my mom, grandma and myself, all we got was a LeSportsac laptop sleeve, which ended up not even fitting my macbook. If you want to buy it, check out my ebay auction haha!

I was also super excited to see a Catherine Malandrino outlet and while prices were an additional 50% off the tag price, there were probably only about 20 different styles, 18 of which were hideous. The girls working at the store were also more concerned with gossiping and putting makeup on than helping any shoppers. 

Skip the outlets and head to the Fashion Show Mall!"}
{"text":"Beware. They now charge an outrageous $5 for parking.  We used to stop by here every trip to Vegas -- spending hundreds each time.  But as a matter of principle, we refuse to pay for parking for a shopping mall.  They've lost our business permanently."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite outlet mall.  In my opinion it's better than Barstow, Primm and others.  The only one I feel is better is Camarillo, CA.  This outlet mall has a parking structure that is close and keeps your car out of the sun, and a bunch of great stores.  They don't fill the mall with stores that you don't care about!  It is a true outlet mall with true outlet prices.  My boyfriend and I both find stores we love and prices are great :)"}
{"text":"A very nice shopping experience except for it being outside.. I'm not use to the Vegas heat yet so that was the only downfall. But they do have trees throughout the center that include misters. I always made sure to walk through these! 

The selection of stores were great such as PUMA, BURBERRY, ALDO, COACH, LeSportSac, and others... There is something to satisfy everyone (except for the little kids, no toy stores, possibly a good thing for parents!). 

You can definitely get a great deal here... Prepare to spend at least 2 hours here!"}
{"text":"The outlet has many luxury brands that you don't see often in outlets, like Burberry, dolce and gabbana and sacks avenue. The outlet has a small food court with very few places to eat. The parking is $5, unless you have a Nevada, it would be free."}
{"text":"This place gets crowded on a weekday and it take awhile to find parking so just work your way all the way up the parking structure. There's not many men's stores and walking around in the heat really makes shopping time feel a lot longer. Not sure if there's really any good deals overall. If you already know what you want then shop here."}
{"text":"Every time I make a trip to Vegas, I make sure that I make a stop here. The first time I came here, I was in awe with all the stores and got lost and probably walked around in several circles before finding the stores I was looking for. Oh, they have maps, but that doesn't help me. I'm hopeless. /After my umpteenth time here, the novelty wore off.  Anyway, they offer a AAA coupon booklet, so if you happen to have AAA, you might want to get the booklet, which is located at the information office. Don't know where that is?  Just ask a tourist, they'll be able to help  you.  

Obviously, parking here blows, especially during the weekend.  But if you come on a weekday, it still stinks, but not as much. You'll actually be able to find parking, provided that you get there early, that is. Or, you can be one of those annoying people who block traffic while waiting for a parking spot to open.

The food court is decent, with a few food options.  The Starbucks, though, is always packed.  It seems that tourists think Starbucks is synonymous with America, or something.  There are a lot of stores to browse if time is not  your enemy.  Personally, I like going into Gap, Banana Republic, Van Heusen, J. Crew, Quiksilver, Adidas Store, Skechers, Nine West, Bass, L'Occitaine, and Crabtree and Evelyn.  I am usually able to find something in these stores. As a tactic to get you to go into their store, there are always sales going on, although from my experience, the sales aren't really sales.  Plus, I'm not in the mood to fight others for the sales merchandise.  

So, in summary, this outlet is a good stop if you're taking a break from losing money, er, I mean gambling. If you're going to give your money away, you might as well get something in return for it.  Just make sure that you get here early if you want to find a parking spot. Happy bargain hunting!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas Premium Outlet North is the best outlet center in the Las Vegas area that offers high fashion at an affordable price. Some great stores are 7 For All Mankind, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, Joe's Jeans, Kate Spade, Salvatore Ferragamo, True Religion and my personal favorite, Tory Burch.....Yes ladies, Tory Burch which is always my first go to store when I visit this center.
 
The only downfall is that it is located outdoors, which can be unbearable during the summer heat when it's in the 3 digit degree. Overall, it is an outstanding outlet center with great finds."}
{"text":"I've only been to these outlets a handful of times but each time I leave with a ton of stuff for way less money than I expected. The parking garage near Saks is a pain to park in on weekends because of how long it takes to snake up to the top, but other than that this place is fabulous. They even have the stores arranged such that if you're just looking for one style of clothing (women's work wear for example) you can easily hit up all the relevant stores within a very short walk. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for sales!"}
{"text":"Oh, the typical outlet stores that you'll see at almost all outlets. But this place stood out to me cause THERE WERE STARBUCKS ALMOST EVERYWHERE! Okay, maybe not everywhere but I'm pretty sure I saw at least three.

To get to the parking structure from the freeway is a little weird. GPS told me to make a left when exiting but you actually can't. You'll see it when you get there.

10-15 minutes away from the strip, lots of great deals, tons of stores, parking is pretty convenient. 

I could see myself coming back again!"}
{"text":"I think the North outlet has better stores than the South outlet.  My major complaint is that it's outdoors. And in Vegas, temperatures go past 110 degrees.  Even with the misters, I cannot stand the walk from the parking structure to the stores and in between the stores.  Parking is another issue as well. It's so crowded that you might not find a spot until you circle all the way up to the top level of the structure!

My favorites here: Burberry, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, etc. Selections at these stores are pretty comparable to those of the premium outlets in other locations.  

If you go to the information center, you can buy a coupon book for $5!"}
{"text":"Easy to shopping. Price is good but with limited selections. Location is good and free parking. Recommended."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars, because of all the outlets I've been to in he country this offers the most options in terms of shops and high end boutique.  Don't come to Vegas and not visit this outlet make it a point to stop and shop."}
{"text":"great place to kill time before heading home. lots of stores with a good selection of styles and sizes. i'm sad french connection shut down but this outlet still has many of my favorites: jcrew, boss, theory, joes, 7, and nike/adidas.

i don't recommend parking in the structure . it can get really backed up."}
{"text":"Awful. It's Sunday on Memorial Day weeken and Absolutely no parking. They had the north parking garage completely closed do not come."}
{"text":"These outlets are awesome. Huge selection of stores with really good prices. The Polo Ralph Lauren store usually has 40% off deals but if you ask a salesperson for help they will give you a flyer for an extra 15% off! We paid only $36 for a nice original Polo shirt. I prefer these outlets over the outlets south of the strip."}
{"text":"Nice Outlet in Las Vegas and very big here I spend time like 5-6hr for shopping and walking around. And so many tourist here too a lot a shop have special discount for customer and about parking they're have building for park for free but so busy. I hope they're have a lot a Restaurant in the future Coz sometime I want something to eat too. Lol"}
{"text":"This outlet mall has a lot of shops to offer with a lot of high-end names attached. I had fun going from store to store and checking everything out. The parking was kind of far away, and the whole place felt a bit 90's, like I had walked onto the set of an old Saved by the Bell episode. Outside of the Kate Spade outlet, which was having a great sale the day I was there, the prices didn't really seem reflective of an outlet mall. While there were a few deals to be found of sure, most of the prices were pretty close to what you would find in the regular version of these stores but the items were overall of slightly lesser quality (lots of hard, thatched leather and plastic instead of pebbled soft leather, etc.). Some of the shops had lines and doormen the day I was there, which made for some interesting people watching. Overall, I would possibly stop by again the next time I'm in Vegas, but I can't say I would be terribly sad if I missed it."}
{"text":"Always a fave! Love how close it is to downtown. Scored some awesome deals at Disney & The Watch Station! My husband also finally found the Hurley surf shorts he'd been on the hunt for. I love that they now have valet. Maybe they've always had it but this was our first time using it. It's pretty slick in how you need to text when you're ready for your car. $8 is worth it. Also cannot wait to have Shake Shack literally minutes away from us. They will do so well there. Yay for no more going to New York New York for Shake Shack."}
{"text":"I have always visited the South outlet and I never questioned why I never visited the North outlet. I have been missing out this whole time! The North outlets are about 15 minutes further from the South outlet and is located near old town Las Vegas. Instead of being an indoor outlet, this is outdoors, but with a structured parking lot (weird that the indoor outlet has an open parking lot, right?). I recommend visiting in the late afternoon or evening during the summer as it can be scorching hot during the day. Why do I like this outlet more? There's similar brands on both locations, but this has a couple more high end brands that suit my tastes more, for example Kate Spade. I do have to say that the food court at the South outlet is much better than the North outlet. I don't think you need to visit both outlets in one day like I have, but if I were to choose, I would definitely visit this place hands down."}
{"text":"okay, i hate outlets.

Its like a curse. I can never find anything for myself. maybe its because i work in retail and know why outlets exist. but still i'm always down for a good deal. everyone always gets stuff but me. Wah. Crybaby moment of silence.

anyways the store selection is actually really good compared to other outlets and the stuff is pretty good. but never finding anytihng for myself is an issue. some of the stores the prices arent even outlet prices. they're regular retail prices. so dont be fooled!"}
{"text":"These outlets are so awesome and are a must stop if you're in Vegas. There are plenty of shopping options, all with really nice premium shopping options at affordable prices. Some of my favorite shops are Off Saks, Scotch and Soda, Neiman Marcus, and All Saints. 

Be sure to stop by the Guest Services booth and check in with Yelp to get a free coupon book with most of the retailers. If you're staying on the Vegas Strip, it's about $10-15 one way to get to the North Outlets by Uber it Lyft.

Also, one cool thing the city of Las Vegas has is a shuttle bus called \"Downtown Loop\", which is complimentary and runs frequently. It picks you up and drops you off at destinations downtown such as the Outlets, Fremont Street, Mob Museum, and The Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (Pawn Stars shop). If you take it from the Outlets, it picks you up behind the Nautica store."}
{"text":"This is very similar to the desert hills premium outlet (Cabazon, CA) and livermore premium outlet (Livermore, CA). 

Even though it is hot outside, there are plenty of shaded areas along the walkway.

The parking structure is awesome. They have lights above each parking spot. When it is empty, it lights up green and when it is occupied, it lights up red."}
{"text":"Shoppers paradise.  Unbeatable deals.  High end retailers.  
'nuff said!

Be sure you stop by the info/security office to get your coupon book. AAA members get it free!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good selection of stores and good selection of merchandise within the store right in the heart of the city.  I found non-outlet full-retail merchandise at the Brooks Brothers store and Neiman Marcus Outlet.  Much, much better than the Las Vegas South Outlets, which was super ghetto."}
{"text":"Nice bustling place, full of tourists and foreigners (Croatians, Central Americans, Australians, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, etc.) speaking their native tongues. Yep, world travelers make our economy great! And most are ready to spend lots of cash and credit. There's even a guy at a center plaza playing some ethnic Chinese, dream-like music. 

I noticed a lot of people buying bags and rolling luggage. Are they really that more of a bargain here in the US?

Stores that I thought had good deals was the Timex store and the Nike outlet. Now if you want the best of the best an have $$$$, go to the Bally outlet, and find some limited sizes for Men's fine shoes. Yes, they are still $500-$600, down from $900-1,200, and they are exquisite AND made in Switzerland, yep from Schweizverein, so to speak. NOPE, not made in Italy as most Bally's are. 

Time goes fast here, best to identify where you want to go first then hit all stores pertinent to you."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this Outlet because there weren't many shops that I was interested in and it was outside obviously because it's an outlet. I wasn't a fan of that because it was cold and I didn't really want to be outside. One thing I like about is though is that they have a food court, and so when my sister ordered these fries with bacon, cheese, and sour cream on top, I got to sit down and eat while my parents went shopping. :) But, overall I'm just not a huge fan of shopping in these areas."}
{"text":"I'm never satisfied with going to outlets because it's always a miss with me. However, these outlets had very good denim stores like Joe's and 7's which I really liked. They have many different types of washes as well as fits. I added 4 more pants to my wardrobe. 

Also, while I was in the changing room at the 7's store, an employee knocked to ask if I wanted water...service can't get better than that. 

Why I didn't give it a 5 is because the parking structure is kind of a mess & those mist fans don't really work."}
{"text":"Outlet has a lot of high end stores if it's something you are interested in. Very similar to other outlets I've been too but not as big as other cities such as San Marcos outlets. Descent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Everything you can possibly need or looking for they have several shooing stores and everyone is friends they also have a large parking garage."}
{"text":"The north outlets are a little nicer than the south location, though they do have pretty much the same stores."}
{"text":"Came here to kill some time, and pick up some new threads/toys!

The Las Vegas Outlets are world renown for their selection of stores, and (sometimes) very good deals! While shopping here, I spent a total of 45 minutes (being a man who knows what you want helps - plus, guys can't hang like chicks can when it comes to their shopping). Snagged myself some slightly discounted electronics, and significantly reduced brand name clothing.

If you're in Vegas and have an hour or so to spare, definitely hit up the Outlets! Oh, and don't forget that parking is INSANE. Maybe you'd be better off catching a shuttle from your hotel, or taking a cab/Uber over here.

Woot for deals!"}
{"text":"These outlets are the best when ice to visit Las Vegas ice to come here and get great deals now that I live here and I'm a local I get even better deals present your Nevada ID and show them that you live here and they would definitely give you an additional 30% off of whatever the markdown prices got a love the premium outlets"}
{"text":"$5 parking! 

I come here at least once a year, and  this year their starting to charge for parking for tourist ONLY! I know it's only $5, so why bother? It's causing traffic going in and out cause everybody needs to stop and dig for money... might need to switch to other outlets... same great stores, indoors, less hassle..."}
{"text":"Let's see.....Coach....Dolce & Gabana....Kenneth Cole....True Religion...Armani....Dooney & Burke....Donna Karen......Nike.....Burberry...Guess...Nautica....Ralph Polo Lauren.....Movado......i think you get my point. Enough said really just get here if you got some real cash to spend and you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink...and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of stuff' I loved the Disney store! And Godiva. The Disney store had $10 towels. That was awesome. Slcoukd have more bathrooms. There is also a cosmetic store for really good price."}
{"text":"I have never been to such an outstanding outlet mall.  This mall is packed with quality retailers, and I didn't see any vacant spaces for lease.  The mall's website is excellent and has a printable map/store list - you will need it, it is huge!

What is even better is that it is services by RTW buses to and from the Las Vegas strip.  This is 2 miles north of Stratosphere.

Banana Republic, Seiko, Kate Spade, Burberry and Diesel were some of the memorable and harder to find outlet stores.   There are a few low-end retailers too."}
{"text":"I come here quite a lot for someone who doesn't like outlets.  Usually outlets depress me and make me want to run for the mall.  This outlet is different: the stores are pretty good and the selection is pretty big.  I am usually a little too successful here and end up spending way more than I wanted to.  I tend to go on Sundays, probably one of the busiest days to go.  There are a lot of places that have specials on Sundays.  

I usually hit up...

Coach: they usually give you a daily coupon for 50% off everything in the store, etc when you walk in.  This store is filled with Asians buying everything before they go home.  I usually come here to get a cute wristlet or wallet for a birthday or xmas present.  I grabbed some sunglasses when I was here last.

Coach mens: I haven't gotten any coupons here but it has a good selection of briefcases and wallets that are on sale, good for gifts for my dad and brother.

Michael Kors: Haven't bought anything here but I always like to look for any deals on their iphone wristlets.  Most useful thing ever.  Perfect for clubbing.

Steve Madden: Help yourself here.  It is like DSW where you just look below the shelf for your size and if they don't have it, they probably have some in the back.  Last sunday they had BOGO 50%!  I got two pairs of heels for $70.  Can't wait to wear them.  I am a shoe lover :)

Cole Haan: Nike air heels?  I always check out their wide selection of heels.  I heard they are discontinuing their line with Nike though.

Banana Republic: I stock up on my work pants and work tops here.  Sign up for the emails and get coupons!

Sometimes I am more successful here than at the mall.  Its a nice outlet t omix into your usual shopping routine.  See ya there on Sundays!"}
{"text":"They've got enough money to terrorize their Latina cleaning crew, who can't stop shaking, and hassle the tourists for parking fees, but not enough to keep their websites updated with the actual businesses who currently reside there.  Hence, you can spend a great deal of time wandering around looking for businesses which phones and computers tell you are there, but it's only accessible through a magic portal in the beauty school which only their students can see...

Shows you how low the bar is to win prizes from the Harvard Business Review.  Overrated and strictly for people who lack access to better alternatives.  And prepare to pay $2.00 for a bottle of water in the scorching heat and concrete; I'm sure a major profit center given how empty many of the machines are and, you know, all those prizes."}
{"text":"From Mandalay Bay hotel, it's a $20 cab ride to the outlets.  If you wish to drive, good luck finding parking.

In the end, it's worth it.  With stores like Juicy Couture, Ralph Lauren, J.Crew, White House/ Black Market, Banana Republic, Ed Hardy, Theory, Armani Exchange and run of the mill stores, like Gap and Sunglass Hut, I've become my worst enemy:  a credit card wielding, cash throwing, window-shopping-is-not-good-enough shop-a-holic!!!

Bring your bf.  You'll need an extra pair of hands to carry all those shopping bags.  

Stick to Subway and skip the Chinese food at the food court.  Too much msg."}
{"text":"I had not been here in awhile but remembered that there are not that many shops that I really wanted to visit.  The parking structure has been improved with lights that let you know when a spot is open (red for used and green for open).  The misters are necessary considering it was about 106 degrees while walking around.  The place was clean, but I would preferred to see more options for snacks or beverages.  The food court does not have that many good options.  The deals were also not that great.  Definitely a tourist spot.  Everyone seemed to buy more suitcases in order to carry home their new purchases."}
{"text":"Won't forget my Boxing Day experience here. Crazy!

Phenomenal selection of stores here, with an emphasis on clothing. It's not all big names either; lots to choose from.

It's outdoor, which is worth mentioning. More importantly, it's impossible not to pick up a bargain.

Poor food options for such a big mall. Get it sorted!"}
{"text":"Love shopping at the Premium North outlet!  It has some of the better brands compared to the South outlet which is a little less designer and a little more 'blah'.  My main problem with the outlet, though, is the extreme lack of parking on busy weekends and their security's ineptitude in handling it. 
If you go there, stop by the customer service office and pick up a coupon voucher book with lots of coupons in it for $5 or free with AAA.  It has a lot of great discounts inside of it."}
{"text":"This mall is great! The cosmetics store was my favorite!!! The lululemon outlet was a dream come true. Everything about this mall was amazing!"}
{"text":"This large outlet mall is located several blocks from the hustle & bustle of The Strip. This is not walkable from the Strip so you should plan on some form of transportation to get you there. It is not as large as some of the other Premium Outlet Malls I have been to but they have quite a few nice stores. Some of the stores are Banana Republic, Dolce and Gabbana,  Benetton, Kenneth Cole, Coach, White House | Black Market , French Connection and Calvin Klein.  I found a great deal on a shirt that I wore to a Christmas party last year."}
{"text":"Huge outlet about 10 min drive north of vegas. It's an outdoor one and there are lots of stores like Nike, Juicy, Pacsun, Vans, Gap, Coach, Tory Burch, etc. There wasn't much of a sale going on Mother's day weekend and the size of the shops are actually pretty small compared to other outlets. Overall I'd say it isn't worth your while to go out of your way here. I actually prefer the Indoor outlet at Primm or the outlet near the airport"}
{"text":"Why have I not shopped here before! This mall is seriously awesome. With stores like Guess, Marciano, Juicy, J.Crew, Banana Republic, Joes Jeans, etc etc you will walk away a very happy shopper! I came here recently for a few business casual outfits after discovering this was the last standing J.Crew shop in Vegas and fell in love with the mall. Ive always been an avid Fashion Show girl, but this def comes in a close second. I couldnt believe how cheap everything is. I will no longer be paying $300 for a pair of Joes Jeans hooray! If you can ignore the rude tourists then I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this outlet a few times and it's always a hit or miss.  I'm generally not a fan of outlet malls but they have good stores.  

It's a good layout and close proximity to the strip if you had to take a cab.  Lots of parking available if you're driving.  I've never taken public transit here because ain't nobody got time for that.  If you're a visitor, it might be worth your time to rent a vehicle if someone is comfortable driving.  Renting a car is inexpensive in Las Vegas with free parking anywhere to be had, but I digress.

One of the better premium outlets - but I'm comparing this to Seattle Premium Outlet which isn't so great.  They have a lot of middle end stores and you'll likely find something for yourself.  I can't speak on the dining choices as I've never been here long enough to get hungry.  From the directory it lists some limited and pretty regular choices like Subway, Auntie Anne's, Starbucks, etc.  Come already fed."}
{"text":"No different than the premium outlet malls in other cities, but the discounts here at too good to ignore. Worth a visit if you're in Vegas for a couple of days."}
{"text":"I'm not an outlet connoisseur be any measure, but I will say that the LV premium outlet is definitely premium.  

Top tip: Before you get there, map out your plan of attack. Be like the Chinese tourists and bring an empty suitcase. Saddle up and get to work!! 

Things I learned: Nike is the anchor store and it's nowhere near the Uber drop-off (by Cheesecake Factory). IMO the North Face doesn't have a lot of desirable clothes and the staff was pretty rude.

Enjoy the ride!"}
{"text":"So the fam and I come here everytime we go to Las Vegas. Living in San Diego, where else can you get the best deals on swim wear, and clothes in general. They have a few beach-y stores, beach in Las Vegas? I don't think so. So whenever we go here I end up buying an load of Billabong, Ripcurl, Hurley, etc. you know those kinda brands. Luckily we usually go to Las Vegas during Christmas, bright sunny days and 40 degrees or less weather. Who doesn't love outlets? They have a variety of stores where you can find fabulous bargains."}
{"text":"Standard fare of outlet malls.  Slightly better offerings in terms of luxury, Dolce and Gabanna, Armani, Burberry, Tory Burch - and others.  -  But not even comparison with the outlet malls near Palm Springs.  Just OK."}
{"text":"BECAUSE, I used to work in this crazy outlet, I am writing a review. Let me just say, the Las Vegas Premium Outlets center is by far, the best one I've been to as far as actual \"shoppability\". Unlike The Las Vegas Outlet Center on LV Blvd. that has outdated and generic stores in its directory. 

I used to live in Hawaii for a few years, so, the fact that this shopping center is an \"outdoor\" shopping center, it adds to my overall satisfaction with this place. 

My favorite stops here are:
Gap, Banana Republic, French Connection, Puma, Levis and American Apparel!
A few mentionables: Nike, Kenneth Cole, Robert Wayne, Quiksilver, Volcom, Pac Sun, White House | Black Market, Lacoste, Calvin Klein,  Armani Exchange, Charlotte Russe, and some others that have slipped my mind at this moment.

I worked at one of the women's retail shops here for a 1.5 years and have to say that I've met some awesome out-of-towners! But, I do have a few complaints in the time I was working there:
1) NO BURGER JOINT in the food court.! Out of all the things to eat, sometimes I just wanted a simple burger... -sigh-
2) HORRIBLE time finding parking even with TWO multi-level parking garages/lack of employee parking only spots.
3) The \"local\" shop-lifters/less-than-friendly patrons.

Besides that, I've been to this shopping center 2 times for the \"Black Friday\" Sales, and have never walked out with a thing, but still was satisfied with my window-shopping. On most other random shopping days, I walk out of the center with at least 3 tops! score..

Definitely would recommend going on a weekday, early! When the shopping center is about to open to avoid the crowded walking spaces, and parking garage hell-hole."}
{"text":"Great stores at this spot, just a short drive off The Strip...great boutique outlets like Ferragamo, Armani, Tahari, Levi's, Ted Baker...
 
If you are a total fashionista/fashionisto, plan to spend a few hours since you'll want to take your time going through all the merchandise.  The food options aren't great, but, then again, you don't come here to eat..."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship for outdoor shopping.  When it's scorching hot outside I absolutely hate it! 

There are a fair amount of reasonably priced stores here. I didn't find any crazy deals! I regret not visiting the Michael Korrs store. My friend found a really good deal on her bag!"}
{"text":"Great location with a great selection of stores: there is something for everyone here. I am alway happy to see a Coach outlet and this location has one. The food selection is nice also honestly you could spent at least 6 to 8 hours here easy; but do your self a favor an are in the spot that is directly behind the shops otherwise you are left to lug are all your treasure back to the parking structures located on both ends of the Outlet."}
{"text":"It wasn't that great. 

Although reduced prices were cool, their selection simply sucked. I went into Juicy, Hugo Boss, Diesel, Ralph Lauren, Guess, FCUK, AX, Lacoste, Seven for all Mankind, and True Religion... but I only walked out with a shirt for work. yeah, sad, huh....

to me, shopping at the Beverly center, Santa Monica Promenade, Century City or The Grove seems a lot more worth it. 

Save yourself some time and go to the Fashion Show center or Venetian."}
{"text":"Much better than dessert hills in terms of brands, Helmut Lang and Marc Jacob store ate pretty good with more sizes"}
{"text":"CONS
1. Outdoors (only because every knows its ridiculous hot in summer and chilly in winter.)
2. Parking- South or surface lots are a disaster! (Suggestion: Try to parking in the North Garage. Its smaller but usually less congested.)
3. Some stores are not really outlet stores they are regular retail stores.
4. Not a great food court (so don't get hungry while your shopping here.)

PROS
1. Great variety of stores.
2. Great prices year round (in the outlet stores.) 

With all the being said the PROS still out weigh the CONS because great prices and great selection conquer all!  I always enjoy my shopping experience here and it is the better of the two outlets here in Vegas. If thus place wasnt sucha mad house to prk i think it owuld have gotten 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Outlet malls are one of my favorite things in the world. 

Before I elaborate, I have a caveat. I actually dislike the crowds, food courts, unnecessary discount stores (charlotte ruse, rue 21...these stores are already cheap in regular malls and there is absolutely no reason they should have an outlet store) and the general reminder of the materialism/hedonism in society. 

Other than the above, outlet malls are one of my favorite things in the world. Not only do they provide many reasonable purchase options, they are also an amazing workout tool. Walking around multiple times in the outlet mall perusing selections (esp in the sauna like heat in Vegas) will guarantee a loss of at least a pound. 

The Las Vegas Premium Outlets are just a class above the rest. The area is neat and well organized. There is plenty of parking (note to locals: avoid holidays and weekends as it gets crazy there) and the most important thing of all: the stores that are featured in this mall are out of this world. 

I personally love the Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Banana Republic, JCrew, Ralph Lauren, L'Ocittane, Gap, Calvin Klein and Company Outlet (makeup) stores. I cannot tell you the number of deals I have scored here. I am currently using a Kate Spade beautiful canvas beg with brown piping for my laptop that has a red and gold polka dotted inner lining...CUTE! And guess what...all this fanciness for under 50 bucks. My entire cardigan collection has been procured from JCrew (the Jackie O collection) and it was at a very attractive price of $19.50 each. There are so many things in my closet and home that I thank this outlet mall for. 

The LV Premium Outlets have also never disappointed any family/friend that has come into town to visit. My New York living yuppie girlfriends swear by the Theory outlet store here and my mom and aunts have spent hours in the Coach store. Even my dad (who buys like one thing every 5 years) did some damage at the Dockers store. If you are spending any time in Vegas, be sure to spend an afternoon at this mall. It's a great way to spend an afternoon walking around, having fun and procuring some cute items at great deals! You will be very very happy you did."}
{"text":"Very big outdoor mall! Has good stores like my favourites: j crew, gap, banana republic, etc. there's a store for everyone. There's also le sportsac outlet, which I have never seen elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We were not planning on visiting this location as we had been to the South Outlet Mall and had spent a very pleasant afternoon shopping there.  However in our attempt to go to Fremont Street to get a Fried Twinkie we ran into a HORRENDOUS traffic jam and street closures.

Every Free Parking structure had a sign that parking was $20.  We knew something was going on as the Police presence was ENORMOUS.  However we were clueless as to what.
It took us forever to get out of the area and our GPS was not helpful as it dumped us right into the traffic going to this mall.  Lots of folks going to the event on Fremont Street (which turned out to be something called Life is Beautiful- it sure was not BEAUTIFUL STUCK IN TRAFFIC)
decided $20 was too rich for them and had infiltrated parking at this mall.  A LOT of Cabbies were also dropping people off.  It took us FORTY FIVE MINUTES to get to the parking structure to park.  We were lucky and got a spot on the first floor.  

Now onto the review of the mall. 

It does not even begin to measure up to the South location.  It does not have the stores or the selection. It seemed to attract a differen kind of clientele. many of the stores blared music that was so obnoxious it  deterred us from going in orvstaying in the store. The Nike store being one of the worst and clearly we were not the demographic they want in their store.

If you want a pleasant shopping experience go to the Outlet Mall South."}
{"text":"Note to self: 

40% Lesportsac outlet discounts for the entire store

Cole Haan - Scored some good stuff here with additional 30% off."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Premium Outlets has always been the better of the Las Vegas area outlet malls. However, since they have redone the outlets down on the south end of Las Vegas Boulevard and made them into Las Vegas Premium Outlets North the original location has really lost its edge. The store selection here is now only SLIGHTLY better instead of being way better. And the southern location while crowded is not as mobbed as the original. This place has great hours; especially a plus is that it is open late on Sunday (after 6 PM). Considering this is 2014 and the era of internet shopping and a 24-7 town, they often get my business when I need to shop on a Sunday and the malls close early in Vegas. This mall is great for people watching as well! However, this mall is also the 'United Nations' of Las Vegas because it is so overrun with foreign tourists, many whom are rude or stupid and roll suitcases around and shove clothes in them. I guess this is why they sell heavy coats and fleece in many of the stores here considering you will only wear those on a handful of instances during a winter day in Las Vegas and maybe 30 times at night a winter. The only negative about the location is it is not in walking distance to any tourist areas (maybe downtown if you really want to walk) and for locals near the Spaghetti Bowl which is a major mess most of the time due to traffic. If you are on the south end of the valley, try the south outlets or even consider driving to Primm to the Outlet Mall there."}
{"text":"Great shopping close to Main Street and the downtown casinos.  It's also down the road from the Strip and is a great place to while the hours away if you don't gamble. 

I shop here twice a year with family and friends as it's pretty affordable.  We split up and shop for a couple of hours then meet at Makino's for AYCE Japanese food and sushi buffet and show each other what we found.   

This trip my friend found $10 Fossil watches and a $6 long-sleeve t-shirt at The Gap.  I had some luck at the Tumi store this time with 50% off of some of their leather goods and luggage.  

I've never had much luck with the clothes and find it hard to find anything decent.  I've also noticed that some of the stores don't really offer much of a discount.  I've had good luck at the Coach and Cole Haan store where they often have 30% off of their sale prices.  The Le Sports Sac store is extremely overpriced and empty."}
{"text":"This review is more for the food court than the stores. First a brief review of the stores mainly they have a great selection of stores Nike, Adidas, Oakley, Guess, D&G and many more expect at least more than a couple of hours to go through the whole thing keep in mind this is all outdoors so dress accordingly especially during the summertime. Now on to the food court well not much of a selection you have Japanese and Chinese, Subway and Italian I actually had pizza for lunch it was ok good enough for my taste buds i also got to sample the teri chicken from the Japanese place and orange chicken from the Chinese place both were good but they could have better food."}
{"text":"Nadia was so kind and know exactly how to provide great service. However I was very displeased with the Latin lady with long hair. My mother asked the lady how much a shirt cost and she told her dismissively \"40% off the tag\"... mind you after my mom said \"the rack says 40% off, can you tell me the exact price?\" The lady walked away.

In the fitting room I asked the same lady, if there was a different size. The lady said, \"I don't know, go check the rack\". Wowzers!"}
{"text":"Great selection if you are looking for purses or high-end fashion.  Not the most fun place for an average guy to shop.  After shopping at the fashion mall on the strip, I'm convinced that the prices are exactly the same.  They seem to just START the prices higher, so that they can be marked down more."}
{"text":"As we drove to Vegas, I watched the outlet malls pass me by one by one. Tanger, Primm, Las Vegas Premium Outlets South. I was worried... those outlets looked big and awesome and I was worried the LV Premium Outlets North would disappoint. But my boyfriend assured me that we were going to the best outlet of them all.

Thanks Andy W. for recommending this outlet mall, it was everything my little heart desired and more. My favorite stores were: 2b by Bebe, Aldo, Coach, Nike, and of course Joe's Jeans. The bf was an amazing sport and shopped with me for over 4 hours.

I hate crowds and so this outlet catered to my picky shopaholic self perfectly. Everything was right there and not overly crowded. For any LA or OC people, the layout of this outlet mall is exactly the same as The Block at Orange. I seriously felt that I was walking around at the Block, but at outlet prices. Way better than the large, non-pedestrian friendly design of Camarillo or Desert Hills outlets.

The food court was severely lacking and if we hadn't been starving we would have skipped it."}
{"text":"= ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITY IN LAS VEGAS =

I had to find some ways to burn off the calories after I stuffed my face at the buffets, and I know for a fact that sitting in front of a blackjack table or slot machine is not going to help much.

You can only window shop when you are shopping on the strip, but you can really shop when you are visiting the Premium Outlets.  There are many stores available: Nike, Puma, Oakley Vault, Burberry, Michael Kors, Coach, etc.  There is something for everyone.  

I wouldn't say they have the best discount, but anything discounted is better than regular priced, right?  The only downside to shopping at this Outlet is that it is outdoor and it makes me want to melt when I am trying to cover all the stores with my purchases in 110 heat.

Overall, I wouldn't say I love it, but this is an outlet worth strolling around if it is not too hot."}
{"text":"When ever I am in Vegas the outlets are a must, there are always good sales going on at my favorite stores and I make it a point to stop in before I leave Vegas. The only problem I have is the attitudes the taxi drivers have, if drive is not long enough so they make money, they refuse and make up an excuse to not drive you. I hope they fix that, other than the taxi's I will still go there and hit up my favorite stores."}
{"text":"Expanded food services and parking is excellent.  Good variety of retailers.  Summer weather can be stifling but October was comfortable!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool space to walk around, even if you don't intend on buying anything. Though obviously, shopping is the main reason one would come here.

Parking can be a little chaotic, even on a weekday. It's free with a local ID, otherwise it's $5.

If you check in on yelp, you can receive a savings passport book at the guest services kiosk. Some stores have better deals than others.

It's pretty well-maintained and there are so many shops to choose from. I was surprised to see that the stores were so well-organized, considering the massive amounts of people who were shopping.

My husband and I were mostly browsing, but we did find some good deals. My husband bought two pairs of Vans shoes for about $75, which is a steal.

I will definitely be back the next time I need new clothes or shoes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love these outlets!! Especially the coach outlet! I left vegas with tons of great memories and a fabulous new purse!

Regular price: $ 359

Price I paid: $98!

Oh yea, it was worth it :)"}
{"text":"Premium Outlets are Premium outlets. The North is outdoor where the South is indoor.  I think North has better stores than South but that's my preference of stores. You get Kenneth Cole at North versus Quick Silver at South.  But some are duplicated at both.

Food court needs improvements. Out of 5 restaurants, 2 are Chinese Panda Express -like. They have other eateries but the food court area only has 5 restaurants.  Needs more variety and/or just more."}
{"text":"Diesel outlet. That is all. Even though I've never bought anything from here...it's just cool to see.

The North outlets is definitely much better than the South. Its got more and better stores all around, and looks nicer overall. The only bad thing about it is that it's further away from the Strip than the south is, so be prepared to do some driving to get here."}
{"text":"The \"security guards\" are seriously the biggest dicks ever.... The parking is horrendous and they actually TOW THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE DESIGNATED EMPLOYEE PARKING.  Go to south outlets... At least you know your car will be safe.  Security calls the tow truck drivers to tow their own people... What the hell?  They are rude and no offense, but if there really was a serious situation that would happen at the outlets,  they would be the first to Segway outta there and leave you stranded and helpless."}
{"text":"Found such great deals here expect to spend the day here.. Look slowly u will find ur deals"}
{"text":"Great stores. Very clean but gets low marks for two reasons. 1 parking is next to impossible. 2 the food court is awful!!

New Michael Kors is going in now (can't wait). Coach, gap, the children's place, dress barn just to give you an idea. 

One last grip..when a store relocates it takes forever and a day for he mall to update the directory. Which I'm sure hurts business. 

Very clean and love the outdoor atmosphere."}
{"text":"After the south premium, didn't like this one. Music is loud and awful. Tons of slow moving people. one time visit."}
{"text":"Don't let the variety of stores fool you.

I just came back recently from Vegas and when I stopped by last Monday, there wasn't much selection. Styles are dated. Sizes are limited. It's either REALLY small or REALLY big sizes. If you are on the smaller end of the spectrum, you won't find much selection at the higher end stores. Quality is poor too, some of the nicer items are damaged... why pay for something you can't wear?

I did like this mall for the fact that it had nice misty stations to cool off on a hot hot day...

Save your time and go elsewhere... if you are a coach fan and plan to pick up nicer purses here, go to Las Vegas Outlet Centre instead (it's at the south end of the strip near the Town Centre)... it's close to the strip and you can bus there for $3."}
{"text":"One of the better outlets in and around Las Vegas.  Even though it's outdoors, they have plenty of shade blocking sheaths that try to cover the walkways so that you can at least avoid the sunshine.

They have plenty of popular stores.  Click here for a listing:

http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/store_listing.asp?id=58

There are two covered parking lots.  I usually go to the more interior one since it seems as though more people park at the one that's right at the entrance.

My wishlist is for them to have a better food court.  They really don't have much to choose from, but at least they have Makino, the AYCE sushi buffet.

I'd rather go shopping here than lose my money at the tables!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of shops, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Pretty good store selection here.  Some of my favorites include:

Coach, Burberry, 2B Bebe, Guess, Pac Sun, BCBG Max Azria, Aldo, Juicy Couture..

What I love is the second you walk into the store you find out they have everthing in the store a certain percent off, sometimes up to an additional 40%!!  

Couldve used some better food options, but then again, who wants to eat alot when you're trying on tons of clothing n what not"}
{"text":"I wasn't too happy with this outlet this is by far my 3rd time coming to this outlet and I never really find anything that I'm interested in. I find better deals at the malls in Vegas rather than the outlets."}
{"text":"Shopping, shopping and more shopping! Wonderful place to spend the day. If you want/need it this place will have it. Don't forget to get your coupon book from the Information Center."}
{"text":"One word: ghetto.

But if I were to give more detail.. well let's just say I expected much more. First Siri usually takes me the highway route (she usually LOVES highways) but she ended up taking me through the shady part of town which is down the street from this outlet. The location is not great & the crowd there reflects that a lot. It was busy but not so busy that I should have worried about personal space. I got unnecessarily pushed around a lot by people high on consumerism. Lot's of shopping crazy tourists rolling their suitcases around .... to fill them up with crap I'm sure & some locals with zero manners. Literally just people grabbing things from right in front of me instead of saying excuse me & bumping into me just to look at merchandise. Yuck. 

To me the stores basically reflect your ordinary mini mall with the exception of a couple of high end stores like Dolce & Gabbana, Marc Jacobs, Burberry, & Tory Burch. It was weird to see those stores surrounded by your average mall stores like PacSun & Hot Topic. I don't really see why they didn't just make this into a mall because although it was outdoors there was nothing giving off a classier then mall vibe such as grass, flowers, a nice outdoor sitting area, etc. Most outlets have something like that to separate it from the mall experience. I don't like malls but I'd rather go to Galleria or Fashion Show (neither of which I particularly care about but can at least deal with on occasion) then come here. 

I'm not a huge fan of shopping in general but I came looking for a pair of cute new flats & found nothing that interested me. A lot of cheap crap & a lot of rejected high end items they sell for full price using big names here. Don't care about the stores nor do I care for the environment. I don't see myself coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Not that great, very busy and it seemed every store I entered was out of what I was looking for.  Parking is horrible as well.  I don't plan on ever going back to this place.  I gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer."}
{"text":"Most of my friends were excited to come here because of the sales, but honestly I didn't find any! At least at the Nike store. Only certain items were actually on sale. I can find cheaper Nike items in different stores. Just sayiinnnggg. There was nothing special about this place. Many stores were messy. -_- 
I walked around and went into almost every single store and I would rather go to the mall than here."}
{"text":"This specific outlet has better stores than the one on the south side of the strip and has the out door shopping environment which I like. I know they are working on the parking garage but it seems that there is always a back up when it comes to parking and you are sitting in traffic for what seems like forever. I also feel the human beings act differently Not sure why but i had some \"strange\" experiences with some travelers here."}
{"text":"We had fun at these outlets - i think we visited twice on the last visit. Great great selection of stores! Prices are pretty reasonable. It's FULL of tourists, so beware! We had a car and drove in so it was convenient, but there is public transport (The Duece/SDX?) that takes you here from the Strip. 

It's a typical outlet mall - so not much to say - lots of higher end stores though so that's nice. Selection is pretty big!"}
{"text":"you might or might not find a good deal and gets really cold out during the winter nights."}
{"text":"Good prices and lots of options available at this outlet. Organized well with a central food court and decent (recently upgraded) parking.

The location is convenient - just off the 15.

I go to this outlet every time I'm in Vegas. If this outlet doesn't have what I want it probably does not exist. It's not a huge outlet but on a hot day carry some water and keep hydrated because the walk around all the corridors feels very long. Plenty of shaded benches to relax and even water misters to help cool off in the heat."}
{"text":"It's close to the freeway, and it has a taxi stand.  Those are the best features, oh and the bathroom was relatively clean.  We stopped here to try to find some comfy shoes and fun tops when the weather did not match up with the stuff we packed.  

There were a lot of people milling about.  People, shopping is a participatory sport!!!!  Grab an item, fondle it.  Determine if it's really worth the price they're asking.  Try on a few bits and pieces.  Don't just stand in the store and stare aimlessly at the wall.  Do not stop in the middle of the walkway and have a conversation with your third cousin twice removed about your bunion surgery in two months.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"There's a Dairy Queen!  Now that's premium! 

However, most of the stores are NOT premium.  There's Spyder and Ellie Tahari, but when is the Gap considered a premium store??  And Coach had the lousiest selection I've ever seen.  I got a great suit at Tahari, so it was worth the $20+ roundtrip cab ride from the strip (the Circus Circus end).  But I dont think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"When visiting Las Vegas, this is a place not to miss. Just a short distance from the strip. Theses are the outlets you want. Many  high end establishments. You have armani, Beb√©, Nike, etc.... Prices are really good, I paid about 100$ for Armani jeans. What a steal.  This place is super busy. Seems like a lot of people from California were here. There is even a food court, I did not eat anything as there is an In and Out burger with in a couple of miles."}
{"text":"I've been to the one at the South end of the strip on several occasions.  I was meeting a friend for lunch downtown and decided to check this one out.  I was there late morning and it was 110¬∞, and not much shade except by the food court. In the 2 hours I was there I got sunburned.  For the most part there was a good selection of stores.  I was surprised there was no kitchen store.  I like the enclosed one better but if I was in the area and knew something could be had that I was looking for I would stop in."}
{"text":"Where do I start...? Every time I come here, I spend one whole day to finish up all shopping wings that this mall offers. It's heaven! 
I never bother going to the South outlet, only to the North one. They have all the stores I'm interested in like Lululemon, Guess, Ferragamo, Lacoste, Kate Spade, Rue 21, Loft, Nike, etc. 
I love this outlet, it's a girl's dream come true! The only thing I wish they had more of are 1)more restrooms (because girls forget to go to the bathroom when they're in shopping mode so by the time they realize it they REALLY gotta go but the restrooms are miles away) and 2) Large locker spaces so that us girls don't have to bang into everyone and everything with all of our accumulated shopping bags from store to store!! 

All in all though, I like the variety this outlet provides. A girl can shop here alone for 5-6hrs (or more) while the bf enjoys his downtown solo gambling time!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent outlets ESP since they added more stores in the last two years. Faves are the juicy store, Cole haan, And Michael kors. The coach store is ALWAYS insanely crowded- I tend to avoid that one. Like any outlet mall, you just have to catch the stores on a good day when not many people have ransacked the merch and they just got in new items."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Premium Outlets to the rescue. My sister was invited to a wedding and I decided to come along. My sister needed a few extra items which thankfully she found here at this outdoor mall while. The venue wasn't too far from this location and it made everything very easy as it's near downtown. That is why we chose to go to this shopping mall as oppose to others in the area.

Parking wasn't too bad especially since they have a parking garage. We came on a Friday afternoon; the mall wasn't super crowded but there were a good amount of people present. We were able to get in and out of stores in good timing. This was my first time here at this outlet as I usually go to Fashion Show Mall.

After all the shopping we spotted Chipotle Mexican Grill and that's where we headed next.

Hours
M-S 9 to 9
Sunday 9 to 8pm"}
{"text":"An outlet that has barely anything on a \"discount\".

Idk how people are walking around with pants, shoes, shirts, and jackets in 105 degree weather.  Freakin ridiculous!"}
{"text":"08.09.2017

We came to do some window shopping today. First thing we noticed is they're installing new parking sensors to help with available spaces in the parking structure. Note to self, bring your own water. The machines are a hit or miss for buying any bottled water or drinks. Luckily there was a Starbucks on the end we were on and was able to get a cold, refreshing water from in there. 

Good thing we came early (and on a weekday) because there weren't any crowds. 

Hubby wanted to look for some new work shoes at the Clarks store. Sadly he didn't find anything he liked but we saw some other cool things, like luggage and backpacks at the Tumi store. 

It's a great outdoor outlet with a wide variety of stores. There used to be misters but this time I didn't see any, so I'm not sure if they still have them. But come prepared with your ice cold water, cooling towel, HeatGear clothing and/or umbrella.  Whatever works to keep you cool out there..."}
{"text":"Ow! My feet, my poor feet!  I walked so much that my feet started aching.  I ended up buying a pair of running shoes at the Reebok outlet.  I'm not complaining, I love the shoes I bought there.  

You would be consider a loser if you don't come out of the outlets with at least 1 item!  I made purchases at the Coach store, Kate Spade, Bass, Reebok store and Zoo York store.  I win!"}
{"text":"Great outlet for the las vegas area.  Like most folks have said, this outlet is way better than the outlet closer to the strip.

Came during the peak time so as expected, it was pretty busy.  Parking wasn't so bad, there's a big garage you could park in, as well as lots of outdoor parking.  

Unlike for example, the Gilroy outlets where everything's separated, this outlet is pretty much in one area, so you won't have to constantly drive from one area to another.  Store wise, they have plenty so I'm sure you'll be able to find something to your needs.

Since the bay area is filled with this sorta stuff, no store really stood out like a sore thumb...price wise pretty much on par with the bay area. 

Food wise, just OK...there's a food court and plenty of snacks and drinks.  But I'd recommend passing on the food and finding a great restaurant after a long day of shopping.  

In terms of getting here, unfortunately it's pretty far from the strip.  You could take the bus, but that will take too long.  There are many taxi's by the parking lot, so the fastest and efficient way without a car is taxi"}
{"text":"Great amount of tourists around mall, makes me fell like I want to travel too. Major difference differences last time I've been here. New parking and  addition of cheese factory. Great amount of foot traffic in morning and afternoon. I go around looking for good deals at adidas, Levi's, and nike. Get hungry and go the the food court."}
{"text":"Great place to kill time shopping.  I've found that most prices offered here advertise 30-40%, but the MSRP is priced higher than standard.  I would venture to say you're netting out a comfortable 15-20$ true discounted value.  

I would definitely stay away from here prior to any major holidays, and the crowds get uncontrollable and the inventory gets sparse."}
{"text":"The name is super fitting.  An outlet of premium stores!

Located off the strip, about 20 minutes drive but worth it if you're in the area and have some time to spare.  Didn't have enough time to check out the entire outlet, but I visited Kate Spade, Nike, Addidas, and a few other stores there.

Large parking lots to accommodate all of us shoppers."}
{"text":"Tired from gambling? Head here. These outlets are fantastic! Many high end stores as well as those you would find at a typical mall. You can easily burn a few hours just shopping through the many stores! They also have plenty of food stalls here in case you need a quick energy bite! 

Also yes parking is a pain but it's organized enough with those little red/green dots that indicate a spot is open or occupied. It really gets the drivers moving when they just have to look for the green vs looking at every car spot to see if there's a opening.



Now I wouldn't come here when that brutal heat comes running to lad Vegas. Too hot!!"}
{"text":"Love this outlet...  Great high end designer boutiques and excellent dining places! Biggest down fall is parking. Always full to capacity and garage is way too far from the mall. Otherwise it'd be perfect."}
{"text":"lesportssac, american apparel, ferragamo, etc...can we say awesome? ok i only shopped at 2 of the 3 i mentioned but whatever. the prices were good. the service at each store was awesome too. the best part? it rained! so the blistering heat wasn't so blistering and the rain dried up quickly as we walked around the outlets. i wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"Well, we basically committed shopper suicide by deciding to go here on Black Friday. What were we thinking? Maybe the mountains would have been a better choice. Aside from the fact that there were millions of people here and parking was very hard to find, this outlet actually is pretty good. There are tons of stores for every taste. The prices seemed really reasonable, although that may have been Black Friday. I am not a huge fan of outlets or shopping in general, but this is a place that I would recommend over the traditional shops."}
{"text":"I'm a girl, and if I'm guilty of anything, it's that I love to shop.

There are plenty of decent and high-end shops (store listings: http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/store_listing.asp?id=58), but when I go to an outlet, I expect great deals. Unfortunately, the \"deals\" here aren't actually deals. In the few stores that I did walk into (huge crowds are a deterrent), some of the merchandise had zero mark downs, and the ones that were on clearance weren't even steals...despite the long lines that may suggest otherwise. Fighting off annoying kiosks and crazed holiday shoppers is not fun. By the time we circled around, I was hungry and the food court options were far from appetizing. Ugh.

Because I rarely stay off the strip, coming to this place was quite the drive and not worth the gas. And since it's almost Christmas time, my best piece of advice is to avoid the parking structure because it's very difficult to turn back around to get out after your patience runs dry (I don't understand why drivers decide to park and wait where they're not supposed to park, making those behind him pull dangerous moves to bypass him by driving into a lane where there's oncoming traffic...C'MON!). There's side lots that are easily accessible."}
{"text":"The covered parking is a big plus because it gets so damn hot in Vegas.  The open air floor plan isn't so great but at least they installed the misting poles & beverage vending machines throughout the mall.  They seem to have better stores (brands) than the one on the other end...South Premium Outlets.  The food court is better too."}
{"text":"Being a Chinaman, I'd rate this Outlet five stars just on value alone, since there is a great selection of stores and it's a helluva lot closer than driving out to Cabazon.  Two things bring it down to four stars though:

1.  I don't enjoy shopping when it's 108F outside.  

2.  I think I saw a coffee shop in the food plaza - because we all need coffee when it's stupid hot outside - seriously, where's the bar?  I'd love to shop here longer if there was a beer garden."}
{"text":"I freakin looove this outlet! They have very good deals and it's close to the strip. You might have to buy another lugguge after going through this outlet. On the plus side, the lugguges will be on sale too Hahah 

This is an outdoor outlet. It's like a regular outdoor mall but with sales everywhere! Good sales too ;)"}
{"text":"This place is huge.  There's a store for everyone in the family.  It's a great place to shop for a good deal.  And if you get hungry, hit up the food court.  Only negative is the parking.  There are some really bad drivers in Las Vegas and they all seem to meet up in the parking garage.  Minus 1-star."}
{"text":"pros...if you are interested in doing some shopping then this is one of those places that you need to visit while you are in vegas.  the outlet store is a bit off the strip, but well worth the trip.  large parking lots around the mall.  and a lot of stores for just about everyone.  

we were in search of some workout clothes and my buddy was after some new golfing clothes as well.  with lots of sports stores we were kept busy: nike, adidas, reebok, izod, and a whole list of other stores.  just walk around and you can find most popular stores and brands. 

cons...parking is crazy here, just a ton of people going to this mall.  prices are still a bit high for an outlet mall, but selection is good."}
{"text":"Finding a parking spot at this mall can be a nightmare.  It's because there are so many cool stores with great discounts that it's so hard to leave!  Sign up for VIP club for additional discount coupons.  Some merchants will accept coupons on already discounted items!"}
{"text":"TLDR: 175 Outlets stores and counting, lots of quick and sit-down dining, kiosks galore, free coupons for VIP club members

A Simon Property Group location, Las Vegas Premium Outlets North provide a getaway destination for travelers and locals alike. With fashion stores like Burberry, Coach, and Neiman Marcus Last Call, you are bound to find something you like. I particularly enjoy the distinct Coach Men's store and the variety of options for children's presents. 

They have a VIP shopper's club that is free to sign up. Online you can find extra coupons limited to members in addition to the coupon booklet you can pick up at guest services, even with the Yelp Check-In. They are usually only good on prices without a discount. But if that doesn't tickle your fancy, some stores offer AARP, AAA, military, and student discounts. Just ask!

The property is well-maintained with multiple garages and side parking that's free! Mind the stop signs or just get a taxi. In the winter, they have heat lamps and in the summer they have the misters."}
{"text":"I love shopping! 
This outlet mall has a ton of awesome stores! I got a couple of really cheap items! They have a Juicy Couture outlet there, and I got some stud earrings for $20! Which is cheaper than paying $50 for a pair of earrings! 

Me and my friend spent an entire day walking around looking at all the amazing stores! I am totally coming back here! The good thing about these outlets, is that sometimes they will have sales, which makes their already discounted price even cheaper!"}
{"text":"Pretty good deals in all my fave stores.  I can see the allure if you don't live in a big city.  Very crowded.  The stores need to lower their AC.  The dressing rooms all felt stuffy!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the better outlet in town! But the prices may not be the most competitive.

Conveniently located just both of the strip, easy access right off of the 15. There are 2 parking structures and a parking lot situated at the 3 corners of the mall. The store selection is pretty good: has most of the premium boutique stores like my favorites Ann Taylor, BR, Coach, Elie tahari etc. 

The food court is very small and during the holidays, it was extremely hard to find a seat to sit down and the bathroom lines get rather long."}
{"text":"I spent an afternoon here with my wife and sister-in-law (and spent a lot of time waiting for them to shop - haha!). Parking is easy and the mall is nice. There are plenty of your typical mall outlet stores like Gap, Nike, etc.

If you're looking for a place to find your favorite clothing stores without having to drive 10 different places, check these outlets out and you'll save yourself some time.

We will be back."}

Last July 2009....
I'd rather drop here than at the casinos.  I have a fat wallet for Las Vegas Premium Outlets.   I had ideas on what to get the future wifey for her upcoming birthday.   Definitely Burberry.... Kate Spade.... some bling .... and added extras to go with the ring!     



TA-DOW!



Thanks Serbelle for helping a brotha out!
Thanks Alvin and Bobby (Lorilla brothers) for taking us out here!

{"text":"I had never been to the North outlets though I'd spent a fair amount of time at the other South outlets. I don't know, my mom hates to be outside and when I outlet shop, it's usually with her and I guess it needs to be inside, whatever. Anyway, I walked down the stairs from the parking ramp (total nightmare, btw, find a lot to park in, you will not get out of that ramp unscathed) and it was magical. Diesel, Banana Republic, Nike, Quiksilver, and the elusive Bare Escentuals outlet. (Although, I think I figured out where Bare Escentuals makeup goes to die when you return it to Macy's, Sephora, Bare Escentuals, etc. retail--I think it comes to the outlet to die. Can't verify, but I put together the puzzle pieces and I'm pretty sure I'm right.)

It's enormous and I would not recommend going on a weekend--you will get run over by hoards of people and their dogs, literally. All in all though, a good place to go for good deals not too far away!"}
{"text":"Absolute best outlets anywhere.  Love the children's polo, baby gap and children's place.  I refuse to pay full price for kids clothes so this is the next best thing.  I also hit up the converse store and scored a couple pairs for the little one.  
Love the Dooney outlet here, probably the only one on the West coast.  The parking is a bit crazy, valet fills up early too.  This is a must do when in town.  I rather spend money here than gamble it away.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Normal Outlet mall, has all the regular stores: Hugo Boss, Juicy Couture, Banana Republic, French Connection, Pac Sun, etc.  They have an indoor food court with outside seating also.  They have a Subway, a Japanese place, a chinese place, a pizza place, etc.   The only thing I could prob recommend is to not go on a weekend...Parking and Food Court is Crazy!  But then again, that's when most of the sales are, so if that's the case..go early!"}
{"text":"I'll have to admit, I thought this mall would rapidly decline over the past 3 years since I wrote my last review.  With the economic downturn and the overall decline of Las Vegas, I thought for sure it would suffer.  However, I was wrong.  It's time for a review update...

All of the Pros/Cons from my prior review still hold true.  The only thing I can add is to the CONS....this mall has a ton of those annoying kiosks that sell perfume, jewelry cleaning, and other stuff....what makes it annoying are the sales people who make cat calls at you as you walk by....it feels like I'm at a Middle Eastern \"souk\".  I just act like I can't speak English and walk right by them.

Besides that one annoying item, it's still a solid place to do some shopping.  There are some great stores here and I'm surprised they didn't leave during the economic downturn.

{"text":"This outlet is HUGE!  It has lots of parking, designer stores, and a decent sized food court.  I love how it has those spraying water towers everywhere! It's very effective since it's hot in Vegas.  There's so many stores, I spent couple hours here just to walk around the whole thing.  I've never spent so much time at an outlet before.

There's so much people that at this outlet, so it makes it hard to walk around.  There's not much clothing stores, just mainly designer purse stores and such."}
{"text":"The only stores I really care about are: Coach, Michael Kors, and Juicy.

Occasionally, Banana Republic

But today... Sooo disappointed... There were no good sales or cute stuff. I usually leave so happy but today... Emptyish. I did buy three shirts from Banana Republic for $16 win!

Make sure youre hydrated and have sunblock bc this is all outdoor and its hot and humid during the summer.

Not many stores but its good. I gety Michael Kors fix."}
{"text":"I'm in shopping heaven!! Usually I'm a little skeptical about going to the outlets. It's just overwhelming and I usually am dissatisfied. We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday and we decided to go Black Friday shopping at this outlet. 

Oh jeez, parking was a nightmare. Hubs just shoved me out of the car so I could shop and he drove off to find parking. So many stores! Where to begin?? Just start walking. This place was so crowded, but it got me excited because there were so many great stores here. Much better than the ones back home in Cali. 

Kate Spade, Coach, Michael Kors, Columbia, so many more!! All my money went here instead of the casinos. 

Make sure to stop by before you leave."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm a regular here.  When I forget to pack some clothes or swimming gear, this is the best place to go.

$9 for sunglasses for the weekend @ PacSun
$24 board shorts for swimming @ Zummies
$8 flip flops @ DC

Nike Outlet Store, Seiko store, etc.

Plus they offer valet, so on a 108 degree day, just valet it and save yourself the heat stroke!"}
{"text":"This place has ample parking. 5 levels of parking.

This place doesn't have knick knacks and small items. This place has premium type items, dolce, ferragamo, nike, Kate Spade, Tag heuler type items. This place is like a discount outlet like Camarillo. This is like a live version of Amazon. There is a food court in the middle, not the best premium type food but it's good enough."}
{"text":"Black Friday Review:

I would NOT taxi there if you can avoid it, the line for a taxi at the end wrapped around and very far back. It was way longer than any of the lines to get inside the popular stores!

I have been going to Vegas for awhile and I'm surprised I haven't been here before now! It is about 10 min north of the strip. Of course the traffic getting into the parking structure and finding a spot took awhile but my dad dropped us off to get started while he took care of that :)

We headed to the food court first to fuel up for the busy day instead. There is a Chinese place, Subway, pizza/spaghetti, philly cheese steak, and a salad place. There is outdoor and indoor seating. It was packed as hell, but the Chinese food wasn't half bad! The outlet itself looks rather small from the outside, but once inside, there are actually a bunch of stores! The directory was super helpful because there are so many twists and turns. A part of it is also still under construction...

Worthy mentions: Banana Republic, J Crew, Kate Spade, Ann Taylor. I get a lot of business clothes for work, if you can tell. They had 50% off everywhere! The Kate Spade long was prob the longest but they had 50% off everything PLUS an additional 20%!! They even give a handy price list so you know exactly the sales total including tax. Other long lines were for Michael Kors and Tory Burch. 

I don't know if the discounts are usually this good, or it was just on steroids for Black Friday, but I def love the selection of stores here!"}
{"text":"AWESOME experience! I called to see if they had any sales going on & they we¬¥re kind enough to tell me the prices and available stuff in my size. I¬¥m so happy I made the drive because I LOVE every single thing I got & was able to get even more than I was planning because the prices were so great! All the staff were so nice & helpful, especially Dani! Even their playlist was dope, I¬¥ll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you get your shop on like I do, and you've exhausted the shops at Bellagio and Venetian, The Mag Mile at Planet Hollywood, The Forum Shops at Caesars, and The Fashion Show Mall, then your next stop just may be the Las Vegas Premium Outlets. 

Some of the stores - Benetton, 7 For All Mankind, A|X Armani Exchange, Banana Republic, Calvin Klein, Bebe, BCBG, Ann Taylor Loft, Ann Klein, Burberry, Diesel, Brooks Brothers, Chicos, Cole Haan, Kenneth Cole, Ferragamo, Nine West, Stuart Weitzman, Timberland, Puma...the list goes on. 

Now, this is not the BEST premium outlet shopping center, but if you have the patience an the time, you just might find some great deals."}
{"text":"Seriously, you want shoppers yet you have half the sidewalks torn up?  We were there on a Wednesday at 10am.  They had 30% or so of the sidewalks blocked of and we only saw 3 workers?  get it done, why so slow...
The selection of stores is good, some big names in here.  The prices are not typical outlet mall.  They are marked up for the tourists like me who thing we can get a deal in Vegas..  So wrong, deals in Vegas are long gone...  Anywhere you have to pay for the privilege of a lounge chair at the pool no longer is a cheap place to visit,  I digress..  
The parking was tough even that early.  Clearly we were there at opening and the staff working the stores have taken all the 1st floor parking in the garage.  Pretty stupid guest service.   Then you hike from the garage to the shops.  If you can get lucky and find a parking spot on level 2 you can take the bridge and escalator and drop in by Nike.
The only real deals we saw were at Kate Spade.  After that we could beat every price and home or at regular retail..

And the final straw...
The food court bathrooms were closed.  No one working on them, but closed.  that is pretty crappy.  The next closest restrooms were the opposite direction of the parking garage.  
First visit, last visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good, we have been travelling USA and the prices here are not as cheap for the same items at the same stores in LA.

This mall has a better range of stores than other outlet malls.

For the same item, please see prices in different malls:

$190 - adidas shoes in LA in mall of Hollywood 
$39 in citadel outlet LA
$60 in Miami outlet
$99 in LV outlet north"}
{"text":"My Daughter,Sister,Brother-n-Law and myself were there in  8/08, we had the best time there and spent loads of money. My favorite was Coach I purchased 3 beautiful bags. Everything that you could possibly want is there. Even though there are outlets in every city this one was special!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when I was little and was never a fan. This place has grown a lot since then. They've added a lot of different stores. The outlet has a different feel since it's outdoor. Honestly, it can be a nightmare during summer because of the heat, but it's nice during the fall.

Stores I like to frequent include: Kate spade (they have random 60% off every now and then), Charlotte Rousse, Fossil, Michael Kors, Nike, Pac sun

The parking structure next to Adidas is bigger, so parking is better around there. They're building underground parking and adding to the structure next to Adidas. Hopefully they get done soon. 

Don't bother shopping the day after Christmas. If you go a couple days before, a lot of stores have the same sale all week."}
{"text":"This place is out of control and the parking is terrible. Since our last visit, they added another parking structure, but it's still awful. Every time one person waits for a car to back out (after taking five minutes to put in the baby seat), the entire line of cars going in gets held up. They added the red/green lights to help you find a parking space, but many of them are broken - you'll chase down the one false green light only to find someone parked in it because the magnet is broken. 

I used to like coming here for Nike and Banana, but now everything just seems like regular price. Nike used to have shoes at outlet prices (mine were $49.99), and now everything is $80-$120. It's the unideal combo of retail prices with Outlet frustrations. Good luck with the fitting room line at Banana. This used to be a place we always stopped by on any Vegas trip, but this has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"This mall is very busy! The reason it's busy is because of the deals that are offered. I have a list of stores to hit every time I go to shop. Robert Graham has one of the best sales staff I  ever encountered at a mall. I will continue to shop there no matter what. Tumi has great seasonal deals and you can't do better then. Ted Baker is hit or miss but I'm a London guy. I prefer to buy Ted in London. 
I fly into Vegas to shop since I don't gamble."}
{"text":"The stores here are pretty high end (Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Juicy Couture etc.) and the deals aren't THAT great, there's only minor discounts from the original price.
But it is a pretty big sized mall and there's many stores to pick from.
The way the stores are set up is nice and spacious. 
This is an outdoor mall however so it's pretty chilly at night."}
{"text":"This is my favorite outlet in Vegas.  Although it's a few minutes north of Vegas, it's definitely worth the drive.  The outlet is huge and has all the main stores, including BR, GAP, Coach, Polo Ralph Lauren, etc.  

I usually come here in the summer, so the weather makes it tough to walk through all of it.  Therefore, I would recommend coming during the spring or fall.  The food court is not that great though...my hubby and I ate at the Japan Cafe grill, and it was not satisfying at all.  

Shopping = excellent
Food court = eh...could be better."}
{"text":"Two words: Coach Outlet.

One of the best Coach Outlets, in fact, that I've ever been to.  They always have a crazy selection in clearance & pass out 30% off coupons at the front door.

Other outlets/clearance shops include:  Bebe, Burberry, Calvin Klein,  BCBG, Ralph Lauren, Cosmetic Company Store....the list goes on and on.

It's an outdoor mall so come prepared for the possible Las Vegas heat.  They do have water mister stations set up everywhere, but not a lot of shade.  The foodcourt has your standard mix of pizza/Subway/chinese/hot sandwiches.  There's also a Godiva shop & a Starbucks next to the court.

Elevators in the parking structures are sooooooo slow, but parking is free.  It can be really busy here on the weekends with tourists so try to to hit here on a weekday if you're a local or your vacation allows."}
{"text":"I have been here four or five times and I always leave with nothing.  I am not a shopper to begin with but I came here for a specific reason to check out items in one particular store.  I do like the lights above the parking spaces so you are aware of empty spots and being outdoor does not bother me even when it's in the 100s like it was yesterday. 

As it turned out, the store to which I was going was on the opposite side of the mall and I should have used the south garage.  My error.  I could have checked online.

I stopped at two stores and didn't purchase anything at either.  I think I should keep a sharp instrument handy and when I think about going to this outlet mall, I should poke myself in the eye so as to remind myself to stay away."}
{"text":"I went specifically for the Ferragamo store and was very disappointed with selection and the price points. Prices are hardly outlet on most of the shoes and the inventory was very weak. I find shopping online to be a better alternative. Not impressed :("}
{"text":"You need to go to both north and south outlet malls.  I personally like the south outlet mall more because it's not as picked over as this mall.  There's more stores catering to women in this mall, but I found it hard to find a store here I liked that wasn't in the south mall that's better stocked."}
{"text":"Last month they started charging  $5 to park  in the only lots anywhere near the outlets.  We needed handicapped parking. They have limited spaces surrounded by empty valet spaces 20 to 1. Once they have your $$ they don't care if you spend an hour trying to park. They are not directing traffic efficiently either. We will not waste our time coming here again!!  Paying to park to shop in North LV forget it. Shame on these outlets."}
{"text":"Leider ist es als 3XL Tr√§ger unm√∂glich etwas zu finden und das in diesem Land. Sehr sch√∂n aufgebaut aber zu k√ºhl. Einige L√§den sind schmutzig am Boden, als wenn hier nicht geputzt wird.

Schade ,("}
{"text":"5 bucks for privilege to spend your money here. Totally not cool. I know it's only 5 bucks but why?"}
{"text":"The outlet mall is large in scale and pretty crowded, even on a cold November afternoon like the day we visited.  There are a couple free parking garages flanking the shops and we had no trouble finding a good parking spot.  While this outlet mall does carry some higher end brands like Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, Ferragamo and St. John, you probably won't be going on a mad shopping spree.  Pricelike the day we visited.  There are a couple free parking garages flanking the shops and we had no trouble finding a good parking spot."}
{"text":"Take a taxi, leave your rental car at hotel because parking garage is a nightmare.  

Hard to find parking, long walk to mall and at closing time, it's bumper to bumper to get out!

Avoid the summer its too hot unless you go early.

Lots of kids stores: Carter's, Children's Place, Disney, Gap Kids, Gymboree, Nautica Kids, Osh Kosh, Stride Right, Tommy Hilfiger Kids, Strasberg Children.  

Food court is huge but not a huge selection.  Pizza, Subway, Sushi, Chinese, Great Steak and Dairy Queen.  

There's also an Orange Julius, Starbucks for some Passion Ice Tea and Annie's Pretzels. 

So get something cold to drink and a snack before you start shopping because after the kids stores you'll want to treat yourself at some of the designer stores like: J.Crew, Michael Kors, Perry Ellis, Lacoste, Oliver People's, Polo, DKNY, Coach, Armani, 7 for All Mankind and I heard my all time favorite Tory Burch has a store here! But I didn't make it on this day.  

Oh, well...

Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy an outdoor mall because while I'm not into shopping, there's plenty of benches so I can relax while the other half goes in and out of his stores.

Before going be sure to sign up online for the VIP club because you can print off a coupon before arriving that gets you a booklet with discounts at quite a few of the shops.  Even if you don't have this, the stores here have mostly outlet prices so cheaper than the same ones closer to the strip.

When this place is busy it's really no fun (well ok the people watching is pretty great) but it's too full to leisurely walk around.  Tue-Thur are quietest days but regardless get there when they open at 10 because the afternoons are typically too crowded.

We use a rental car while visiting Vegas but plenty of people take taxis to this mall and there's always a row of them waiting to take customers elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice outlet!

It's got most of the stores that you would like there....  (However it's not like the Cabazon Outlets where premium shops are abundant)

Pros:
- Lots of stores with new expansions
- Affordable shopping option because it's the outlet!

Cons:
- Parking, yes... they have made improvements but parking is still a pain in and out of the garage (2 garage lots available)
- Too many people!  Store distances across from each other was approximately 15 - 20 ft. so when there's lots of traffic it's hard to get thru at times...

Tip:  Best shopping days are 1-2 weeks before black friday, and also during the month of December running thru the 1st week of January.

Overall I do enjoy this place, just gotta decide what I was going to purchase before heading there, then get there as early or late as possible!  

Have fun shopping!"}
{"text":"awesome shopping mall, you can find everything you want just in a mall, and of course it's outlet, very good prices :))
all the shop are super friendly, super cute. they also help you to find the size in another outlet near by and let you know everything you want :)"}
{"text":"While the girls were in town making sure that I did not get lonely over Fathers Day they decided that some shopping cures most ailments. Their visit did help numb the emotional pain that I was having, and shopping here at the outlets made me begin the healing process. With all of the love and support from beautiful friends. 

Having many shopping experiences here in the past this particular trip I seemed to really connect with the sights and sounds surrounding me. Maybe because this is the first visit here in my lonely new life. Through the vastness of my new world I have discovered many wonderful things that I had no prior knowledge of here at the outlets. There is a Shake Shack located here currently across from the customer service area. Now individuals can enjoy fantastic burger and shakes while doing the most all American sport ever. Shopping!

The selection of stores is not the typical outlet type stores. Here most of the stores are a higher quality and standard of goods. Such as St. John, Burberry, and Vince to make a few of my favorite choices. It is an outdoor mall with lots of walking and people watching opportunities. The parking area is covered and highly secure. Plus parking is free here too, unless one feels the opportunity to pay for closing parking. With such fabulous stores that we all know and some we could only afford shopping here this is the place to get some great deals no matter what your seeking!"}
{"text":"I like that everything is outdoor, a different experience then in Canada! has the usual designer brands that a lot of people like.The food court is however; isn't impressive at all (not much of a selection to choose from, would skip it if not totally hungry.) ADIDAS was having a fantastic sale when I went which was (06/29/16). Spend $150 and get $50 bucks off, not bad!"}
{"text":"Got the girls all there nic naks for the bargain , Make up, purses, wasn't to crowded but price was worth some of the hassle , I don't leave reviews to complain but the homeless loitering made me uncomfortable but that's what I realize you have to tolerate in this city"}
{"text":"Rude not friendly. Expensive. Have no seating for even disabled people. Violation of the ADA I would think !  Don't shop here. I gave them one star because I can't give the NO STARS."}
{"text":"They have Theory and Vince.  That's all that matters.  It's a nice, clean outlet.  Not as big as the Cabazon outlet near Palm Springs or the one down in Carlsbad, but it will do.  One gripe, though... the men's section at Theory/Vince is pretty small.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"The parking is insanity! But once you are in you can spend the whole day here! Adidas, Bebe and Disney are my favorite stops. 
This place a gigantic with all the best stores with in going sales. You can buy all the best brands on sale. 
Premium outlet means they carry both the regular stores clothes as well as outlet clothing (sale clothing). 
You have a much better chance to buy your favorite things at a lower prices. There's lots of food to choose from as well! I'm the summer they always have there misters on to help with the heart. 
The holidays, beginning of summer and back to school you will find the best sales!"}
{"text":"This place is usually very well organized with parking and the stores. 

My 1 star rating is for the POORLY EXECUTED parking structure! Sections were blocked up all the way up the structure. That caused so much confusion and traffic for customers. This definitely needs to be improved..."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of outlet malls but this one is not very impressive. Traffic in the parking garage, overcrowded stores, small food court and prices are still relatively high and some store don't even have outlet prices. Still I keep going back there because of lack of alternatives so far."}
{"text":"Las Vegas North Premium Outlet

I am not a big shopper and I prefer to do my shopping online.  I was never a fan of this outlet's layout. It's confusing and I easily can get lost here.  The Las Vegas North Premium Outlet is an outdoor mall.  It is scorching in the summer, freezing during the winter, and extremely wet when it rains.  But I must admit it, this outlet has a lot of deals at some of my favorite stores.  In my opinion, the Under Armour and Nike at this outlet has the best selection and deals.  And most recently, North Face had some bargains that I just couldn't pass up.  The restaurant options at this outlet is better than the south outlet.  This outlet has a Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Shake Shack (expensive small burgers), and even Amorino for some legit gelato. Overall, you can say I'm a fan of the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets.  However, I'm still not a huge fan of the layout."}
{"text":"By far my favorite outlet and probably mall! Last year I went the Saturday before Christmas and couldn't find parking (totally my own fault) had to jump out of my husbands car and run to the Michael Kors store. worth it!!! The gift I purchased was 60% off with an additional 20% off! So awesome! Same sale I hit this year. Because I planned ahead and went on a Tuesday afternoon this year I instantly found a parking spot and was able to leisurely stroll the mall finishing up my shopping completely. This is my new tradition for Christmas shopping. I didn't even need a few cocktails before attacking this task."}
{"text":"I love our nice downtown outlet mall but my god, they need to do something to fix the parking situation! It is next to impossible to find a parking spot here! It's so bad that locals like me are actively avoiding shopping at this place! Be prepared to wait and wait (and wait) to (maybe) score a parking spot in the garage! Although the garage has been recently expanded, parking is still a pain in the butt! Don't even THINK about attempting to shop here on a busy weekend or on days with super nice weather. 

It's a shame about the parking because this is a really nice mall. There are some mid-range designer shops and lots of fun places to browse. I'm not sure the prices are truly \"outlet\" prices, so know the retail cost before you go. There also aren't a lot of options for dining or drinks / snacks, so you can't really plan to spend an entire day. The Starbucks location here is always packed with no seating and lines out the door. 

Note that this is an outdoor shopping mall so if it's a super hot day or if there's bad weather, there is no shelter from it. I repeat -- avoid this place on super hot or rainy days! I've also noticed that there have been more sketchy people hanging out here. If you are a group of girls, get ready to face catcalls and more from male shoppers. Last Saturday there were a ton of security guards around. I don't know what that was about but it didn't stop the catcalls. 

I still prefer the Premium Outlets South since they have more \"down to Earth\" shops that normal people can shop in everyday. They also have a much nicer Disney Store Outlet there and parking is never a problem."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to find any clothing you can never think of from any brand install the pricing is very depend on what you want to buy. 
Your tourist and you come to town to the right place for you to find the best deal from all the different stores. 
very recommended"}
{"text":"My favorite mall in Vegas, many upscale brands to choose from.  They even have an Ed Hardy outlet here.  This is an outdoor mall and they are dog friendly, our mastiffs go shopping with us here all the time.  There is plenty of parking unless you go on a holiday and there is even valet parking.  We never stay to eat though, the food in Vegas is TOO good to waste it on fast food.

Note, if you are into Architecture behind this mall (east of it) there is a new Geary building, it's really awesome and a must see."}
{"text":"OMG - this is such a crap hole.  How on Earth did this place get 4 stars??????!!! Junk ! JUNK! JUNK!  

And the prices ARE NOT a deal - try the Amazon scanner app.  Unbelievable. 

What a trash heap."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing actually.

I had expected a lot more coming here but it was really small and not impressive at all. I spent only about an hour walking around and going into a few stores. Most of my time was spent in Guess due to a long line. Walked into Charlotte Russe looking for deals since it was an outlet mall but found the same prices, same styles as the store back home. Super let down with just that.

The food court was even worst. A small room with 4 choices of food, which didn't taste great either.

Overall, the time spent traveling from the strip to the \"outlet\" in 100 degree weather wasn't really worth it. Despite that, I did however score a cute bag from Guess and new kicks at Nike.

Visit again? I'll pass."}
{"text":"I think I can start spelling \"disappointed,\" \"Las Vegas Premium Outlets.\" 

\"Vegas has amazing shopping.\" \"The outlets get you amazing deals.\" I guess I may have heard these phrases one too many times because I went there and my heart broke. My dreams were dashed. I think I heard the sound of a unicorn dying as well... 

Maybe it was the time of year, maybe I'll try again but despite the amazing number of shops nothing was actually a deal. Everything appeared to be normal price and the selection at every store was seriously lacking. The same stores at the Seattle Outlets yield a lot more selection. And as far as price, I did end up buying one dress, and after the exchange rate (didn't have to pay duty though) I saved a grand total of $4 from buying it at home. 

The cool thing was the mist spraying trees in the concourse to keep you from melting, I really appreciated those. Also, if you're taking the bus, you might want to rethink it. The deuce will get you to the transfer point quick enough and then the 108 bus only comes once every 25 minutes there, consider cabbing if you have the cash. 

All in all, I would just say that there HAS to be a better place to shop."}
{"text":"When in town, we do most of our clothing shopping here at the North and South Outlets. Las Vegas North Premium Outlet is also referred to the \"outdoor outlet\" and the South Outlet is the \"indoor outlet\". The North Outlet is the one that is \"downtown\" and the South is the one by the strip. Just remember \"S\" (South) for strip. 

As of today (03/27/18), the North Outlet charges non Nevada residents a $5 parking fee. With a Nevada ID, the fee is waived.  This is the only reason why I didn't give it a five star and this reason alone will not stop me from shopping here because the savings alone in all the merchandise you will purchase here will exceed the parking fee. 

This Outlet has all the major brand clothing stores. It's really busy here and merchandise do tend to run out fast. Most of their products are in the floor but already ask a sales rep to check the back for you I've got lucky a few times. If they don't have it, they will be more than happy to call their sister store at the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet and place the item on hold for you, if it's in stock. If they don't offered you this option, ask. They will do it."}
{"text":"To my surprise, as of 3/26/18 they charge $5 for parking unless you're a local with ID. This charging for parking has gotten out of control. I had to go back to the mall to return something not even buying anything and it's $5! The stores are great but who ever heard of paying to park at an outlet mall???!???!!?!"}
{"text":"it's huuuuge of life compared to the outlet home in Hawaii! Nothing really wow you tho the prices almost the same as back home too! however so much nicer the set up! Just the outdoor walk was wonderful! Thank you for the experience of your outlet"}
{"text":"It looks like they finally managed the parking problems! At least on a weekday. Don't know how it works out in the weekends but there is an extra parking garage at the south side of the outlet.

The outlet is completely outdoors. So hot in summer! They spray water, but not enough to withstand the dessert heat. So if that bothers you, go to the south location that is indoors and airconditioned. Compared to the south location you'll find 70-80% the same stores. The rest is more high end than on the south location. 

In the last years the outlet has been expanding, and it looks like they still are. So enough options. There is a below average foodcourt but the're also soda vending machines and yesterday I noticed two food trucks. Can't be worse than the foodcourt. The're is a Starbucks with wifi. The outlet offers no wifi."}
{"text":"Oh. My. My heart skipped a beat. I LOVE the North Premium Outlets. LOVE them. My first day here... I didn't even make it through all of the stores and I had TONS of bags. The variety of stores is GREAT and the prices are even BETTER!!! The Nike outlet is HUGE!... Steve Madden you have my heart... and of course you do too Ed Hardy and Juicy Couture!... I could go on and on, and well, on. I came back here AGAIN during my trip to finish up some shopping. Just LOVE it here. If we had this back home... gosh that'd be dangerous LOL! A little bit of everything for everyone here. Lots of parking and valet if you can't find a spot. Decent size food court. Drinks are pricey though, beware!"}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE shopping, and this outlet mall has it ALL for me!

First of all, I have purchased two deeply discounted, beautiful, buttery leather Coach purses here at two different times, and both times, I received an additional 30% off coupon. These purses are wardrobe staples for me, so I love that I got them as bargains. Like so many others have raved, the Coach Outlet is THE SHIZ.

This mall has plenty of other great stores to choose from to include J. Crew, Gap, Brooks Brothers, Oakley, Juicy Couture, Nike, and so much more that it makes my head spin with retail longing.

If you're in Vegas and you're really into shopping but you don't have the dough to afford the likes of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shoppes, then you need to stop here. It's an outdoor mall, so bring plenty of water to hydrate with because if you're like me, you'll want to walk the whole mall more than once to make sure you've seen it all.

P.S. I live for the Calvin Klein store here."}
{"text":"Just got back from a recent trip to Vegas and MORE STORES ARE NOW OPEN!!!!!!!!
Burberry, Catherine Malandrino, True Religion and Juicy Couture were the new stores I visited and I was in utter heaven.
I believe Ferragamo, Missoni, and Ed Hardy are opening soon too. I saw that they were fixing up the stores and looked almost complete.
They have the usuals also - Polo, Guess, A/X and FCUK to name a few.
I was also really happy that they had a Lacoste, Dolce and Gabbana AND OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!! A SOLSTICE OUTLET STORE!!!!!! OMG I was about to faint when I entered. Designer sunglasses for more than 50-60% off? I'm getting lightheaded just thinking about it!
I spent about $1k in a matter of a couple of hours but oh lordy, I sleep and cuddle with all the  beautiful things I got. I'm so in love.
The BF and I are planning yet ANOTHER trip to Vegas before the end of the year, just for the very fact of going to the Premium Outlets to go shopping.  We are such label whores."}
{"text":"omg this is my outlet to go to when i am in vegas. 

some of my fav shops i always come visit are Burberry, ted baker, boss, bally, Salvatore Ferragamo,d and g, swarovksi, and time watches place. 

i really like how this outlet have nice fancy brand names with the price up to 75% off which is a killer deal. i love coming here to find accessories such as leather wallets, leather shoes and etc. the outside setting of the outlet is nothing fancy and seems casual which is a plus if not in the mood to be dressy. 

also they added a new store to this outlet which is ballys if your a ballys fan which i finally went inside and looked at their products and made some purchases on the wallets. 

i always shop like crazy and spend and arm and leg. i always will find something inside the Swarovski store and make a purchase because i love the sparkly accessories here."}
{"text":"Great place to come and purchase whatever you are looking for.  Better to go shopping than gamble as you have something that can bring back home."}
{"text":"Completely OK mostly-outdoor mall with a large parking structure that fills up quickly yet says there are nearly 200 open spots when there are just a handful on the upper/outdoor level."}
{"text":"This mall is pleasant and much more reasonable than say the Forum Shops at Caesars.

I usually go straight to the Adidas and Nike stores here.  I run a lot and to save my knees I switch out running shoes every 2 months, so they stay bouncy.  You can get a solid pair of Adidas running shoes for $45, I like the Duramo's, which are as good for your feet as the $120 Nike Shox they sell at Foot Locker.

I never eat here, the food court is blah-and."}
{"text":"$5 to park your own car? Really? The owners of the center should be ashamed. I will never be back. I wish I could give them zero stars."}
{"text":"I guess coming from florida and having all the outlets down here I just wasn't that impressed. We went over as we stayed a week and needed to pick up a few more clothes. Good variety, prices were nothing great, a lot of foreigners and very crowded long lines. If its your only stop while in the states, and you can't get this stuff at good prices at home, then go. If not, wait till you get back home and see some other sights instead."}
{"text":"If you love shopping and ur in Vegas, you gotta hit up this outlet mall! It's located not too far away from the strip, and easy to get to via the freeway. It has a lot of pretty good stores, including Burberry, Coach, Guess by Marciano, Juicy Couture, BCBG, kate spade, bebe...just to name a few of my favorites. I wish there was a gucci outlet though...and I must say that the food court / restaurant selection could be better. There's only one real food court and the selection isn't very great at all. But I guess you are here for the shopping and not the food, so it's all right."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Premium Outlets, what can I say....this place will always be packed because well Coach, Juicy, Nike and many others all at discounted prices. Of course there will be a lot of people here! 

This place is not a good place to go when it is super hot, because well its an outside mall! It is a pretty big outlet center, and well there isn't much to say because it is just like a mall but with cheaper stuff of course. 

They do have a food court here as well, which thank godness is indoors, good selection of food. Their Nike outlet store is pretty big, but nothing like any other nike store you have been into before. 

Other than that, usually this is a place you have to go to during a Vegas trip, just to check if maybe something you like at the regular store is there, and a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"Holy moly - this must be the only place in Vegas that makes more money than the casinos. I have never seen so many people walking around with shopping bags. Several people I saw came with their own suitcases to take home their new purchases and / or needed to buy new suitcases to cart all of their belongings home.  We made a pact only to go to two stores since there was so much more we wanted to do in Vegas.  We opted for Ferragamo and Polo.  Both experiences were wonderful with friendly employees and lots of good deals to be had. A lovely place to walk around and get some good deals if it is possible to pull yourselves away from the tables and all of the other activities in Vegas for that long."}
{"text":"Good variety of stores, including a few premium stores if that's your style.

This place was busy (as expected) on Black Friday and there were pretty good sales going on.

We found parking in the garage, but closer to the top of the roof. Their garage is even premium showing how many spots are free. But it's a tight fit going in and out.

Shop here before spending all your money at the blackjack tables."}
{"text":"Didn't even go shopping, because we waited in the parking garage for over 30 min trying to park. Didn't end up parking. Therefore we didn't go shopping here. Plenty of open parking spots that the security has blocked off. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE TO SHOP."}
{"text":"Me encantan todas las tiendas !!!! Es un excelente lugar para poder ir de compras y en familia"}
{"text":"On my last trip to Las Vegas, we had a rental car so we decided to put it to good use.  This outlet mall has a parking garage so parking isn't a problem.  This location has nike and lululemon.  They have a few other high end stores.  I was able to get some shoes at Ferragamo too!"}
{"text":"It's exactly like any premiumo outlet I have been too. The only shop that I don't have back gome is Oliver Peoples. The staff are weary about tourists, which I understand."}
{"text":"The new parking fee at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets obviously is designed to stick an additional $5 cost to out-of-state visitors.  We have shopped at these outlets on every visit to Las Vegas.  Not anymore!  I hope out-of-state visitors take their business elsewhere.  There are many shopping opportunities in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"OK - this is MALL...I'm a girl...what's not to love!  :)  This is an outdoor mall, so if you want to brave the heat (especially during the summer), then this is the mall for you.

They have everything you can imagine, from a food court, to shopping for the family and even Starbucks!  I didn't get to spend as much time as I liked, but for what I was looking for, I was happy.  I went to Starbucks to grab a nice cool drink.  Went to LeSportSac to get a good deal on a versatile & functional backpack.  I even stopped to grab some make-up at Bare Minerals.  

Went to Vegas for a little mini vacation before moving to Dallas and for the wedding of my god-brother, so this was a nice break in my gambling adventures.

I will be back for sure to check out the rest of the eateries, especially the sushi buffet and shopping. :)"}
{"text":"So I must confess that for the majority of my adult life, i have hated outlets. I didn't like the idea of items that were not good enough to be sold in stores to be sent here, and really, how much less were you paying? Really?

When I arrived in Las Vegas I admit that the selection of stores at the outlet amazed me, but still, why pay brand name (outlet) prices if it was not worth it? 

Fast forward to a couple of months ago, when I came back after a two year hiatus. I only went to a couple of stores, Banana Republic and the like, and I was amazed! AMAZED! I could not tell the difference between the store and the outlet items. Holy crap! After that visit I was sold, and now I don't see a reason why people go to the mall. 

I agree that parking is a nightmare, so I suggest you get there a little before the stores open to get a good spot. Although I love shopping as much as the next girl, I really just like to get in quickly and get the heck out of there before it gets to packed."}
{"text":"the best of the vegas outlets IMO. drop off the relatives, go for lunch, gamble a bit and pick em up after 3 hours. DONE!"}
{"text":"This outdoor mall, just off the 15 and 95 freeways (Spaghetti Bowl) is our favorite place to shop, in Las Vegas. We've come so often that some sales people here know us, at several stores. We do some of our Christmas shopping here. There are so many places to shop- Coach, Dooney & Bourke, LeSportSac, Harry & David, Adidas, Quiksilver, Banana Republic, Gap, Oakley, Clark's, Ann Taylor, and Disney, just to name a few. This is a way better center than the Las Vegas Outlet Center (formerly Belz). (Tip: Additional 10% discount to AAA members at Banana Republic & The Gap when you show your card at checkout. Senior Discount on Tuesdays- 10% off. If you join the website, you will receive insider sales & additional coupons.) So many options, so many ways to save money, such a great place to go shopping! Pretty much something for everyone. Ok, sometimes we just like to walk around and window shop- so we don't always buy something- just wanted to clarify. Definitely, good people watching. 

The Welcome Center offers discount booklets for free to AAA members; just show your card with your ID. This is where Gift Cards are purchased (center wide). The Food Court is ok. A plus- outdoor seating that is semi-covered. Many snacking options like Starbucks, Auntie Anne's Pretzels, and Godiva. Vending machines in the beginning and near Adidas. Makino's is not as good here, compared to the Decatur/Flamingo location. Five bathroom options throughout the center. Security presence seems to be more visible; maybe because there are a lot of tourists here. There are two parking lots here but seems to get crowded the worst around the Holidays, so get there really early (or you could be waiting in line to park for almost an hour- yeah that really happened to us, last year). Midnight Madness, a Thanksgiving tradition, seems to be a big hit with shoppers and retailers alike. (Note: Ultra Diamonds seems to have slightly different hours than the rest of the mall.) Yes, might not be so sun-safe during Summer months especially July & August- at least the misters are on! Either avoid it during peak UVA/UVB hours or wear lots of sunblock and a hat. If you are prone to overheating, avoid it in the summer time. 

Needs a recycling station for out of town shoppers who like to toss their shoeboxes into the already overstuffed trash cans. I've heard that stores refuse to keep the shoeboxes. Donate your shoes to Timberland and get 10% off your purchase. Donate your shoes to Nike- which is recycled into material for children's parks."}
{"text":"I am a frequent Las Vegas visitor and this is my favorite outlet mall in Vegas. They have a wide selection of stores, I'd say more than any of the other outlets in Las Vegas. Its a nice outdoor outlet center to walk around. They even have a pretty decent food court. They have a Makino. Some of the highlight stores...Coach, Burberry, Juicy, Theory, Benetton."}
{"text":"This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to shop at. From Nike to Nautica to Sunglasses Hut, everything that is important is here. Nike has plenty of basketball shoes to choose from, from Air Jordans to Huraches. Nautica and Ralph Lauren Polo offers the newest designs that is consistent with the seasons. Sunglasses Hut offers Pradas, Guccis, Ray Ban, and many other sorts of brands. Overall this outlet has everything and each store is fully stocked with the best of the best. There is plenty of parking and it is overall a very nice place to spend some time with the family."}
{"text":"Las Vegas premium outlets north has better selection than the premium outlets south in my opinion."}
{"text":"Concurrir a este buen oulet de principales marcas. Muy bien organizado y muy buenos negocios. Es a cielo descubierto, fui a inicio de primavera, y no hab√≠a mucho calor. Tiene cafeter√≠as y patio de comidas no tiene wiFi. Utilice una cuponera q sali√≥ 10 d√≥lares y  no me result√≥ muy provechoso. Llegues en un bus que me dej√≥ enfrente y all√≠ mismo te lleva de regreso."}
{"text":"Great outlet with lots of variety. Discounts are not that much but is always a place I must go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I remembered these as the go to place for shopping in Vegas but on this recent visit was disappointed to be charged $5 for parking and found very little worth getting excited about. With all the shopping on the strip I'm not sure this is a spot worth the trip anymore."}
{"text":"We decided to do some shopping and chose the Las Vegas North Outlet since it was on the far side of the Strip from us and it gave us a chance to see both ends. We took an Uber over and it was about a 10 minute ride from Aria. 

This is an outdoor mall, so consider the weather when choosing this place. It was over 110 when we went but the stores are really well air conditioned. There are lots of misting fans and shade elements placed along the sidewalks to help reduce the heat between stores as much as possible. 

I found a great pair of new work shoes for next to nothing at the Adidas Outlet and my Fiance was excited about the Marc Jacobs Outlet. There were a few options for dining as well like a Cheesecake Factory. There were lots of options and plenty of deals to be found. If you can stand the heat, it is worth checking out."}
{"text":"This outlet was well maintained and clean. You have a variety of stores to shop from and even though it is an outside outlet they have places with shade so you can get out of the sun.

While visiting Las Vegas, I didn't rent a car. It was super easy to get here via the SDX bus on the Strip. You can even get on the free Downtown Loop bus right by the outlet mall. I was heading in another direction so I just rode the RTC.

There were plenty of vendors and food places here if you want to avoid the crowded food court. I think what really stood out to me is that the outlet mall had a Chinese New Year performance going on around the shops at the outlet. That was awesome!"}
{"text":"First came here seven years ago, I was amazed as the north premium outlets were a place I could find deals and do some serious damage to the credit card that I had to put self control to task or I'd have a huge CC bill a month later. Nowadays the deals are less and less folks. Sure the shopping has many options per store but the deals that were always 40-70% off are now 25-50% with less and hard to find 50% deals. On this visit many stores were in the 25-30% range? What's happening premium outlets? You used to be amazing for deals??!? Now it's just like normal shopping to me? 

From the Wynn it was a shade over $15.70 for a taxi ride +$2 tip and on the way back it was $16.50 +$2 tip to Caesars palace. Considering I didn't buy much I will not come here again next visit if this is becoming a normal mall (masking as an outlet).

Tax is 8.1% on purchases here in the state of Nevada. Keep this in mind."}
{"text":"Outdoor mall!! Wooo. I love outlets! I came in an uber and they are all located by the taxi area. Find Kenneth Cole.

Since I came early December, lots of stores had sales. Has high end to low end stores, an interesting inside food court, and pretty decorations for the holidays. It's a long walk but there's usually one store I'd like to walk into. Plenty of seating for those that are just accompanying the shopper or just really need a seat. Definitely check out this outlet if you're bored of gambling and want to put your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"They started charging for self parking and the only free thing is the garages that get full after the first hour of the mall opening. So stupid. They should make it easier for people to come and visit the stupid mall."}
{"text":"Loved this outlet! They have all the brands that everyone loves. Plenty of parking. Hi tech parking space monitors and directory. Still the same outlet prices you'd expect. They have a big food court and Starbucks kiosks scattered throughout the mall. Beware: this is an outdoor mall so if the weather is off be prepared. Only bummer, which is not their fault, is that there's lots of construction on the freeway and the street on the way to the mall. So trying to get to the parking alone is a bit of a challenge, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"I tend to always hit up the outlet when im in vegas. its a nice place for brands I like. the only downside is the food court.  OMG its so bad...its small with only 5 options to chose from and I did not like any of them.
we settled for the china food and it was nasty... :(


I like the bebe shop there (since im a member)- the staff was very nice and helpful :)
xoxo"}
{"text":"All my fav stores :) even dinner at my fav pizza spot. However I was disappointed to hear that we weren't able to go back and shop earlier on a Sunday. We are from out of town and would have like to go around 10 ..... Over all had a blast."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor setting. Good mix of shops. Loved that they had a DQ/Orange Julius place. Sales staff in every store we visited was super friendly & helpful. If you want the coupon book, the office charges for them. We got a free one for unlocking the offer on Yelp so make sure to check it out if there is one available."}
{"text":"BEWARE!! i was shopping for a cellphone case and saw this stand near to carter's this sale associate grabbed my phone claiming that he wants to go in the back to see some cases with my phone im like hell no give me my phone ur not gonna take my phone with you and he got the balls to say im racist cause hes black weither ur black hispanic or filipino idgf ur not taking my things with you. He came back selling me this 30 dollar case where you can find on ebay for 6 dollars LOL other than that shopping experience here is awesome"}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas I always wonder what is more expensive: hanging in the casino or buying a bunch of junk here you don't need?

I do like this outdoor space but it is cluttered with aggressive salesmen and women desperate to make a buck off you. The hide in small booths in the middle of the outdoor walkways and pop out as they see you walking by with a less than perfectly purposeful walk.

This lady selling skin care stuff did just that to me. She grabbed my arm after popping out of nowhere like a bird in a coo coo clock. First she rubs sea salt on your arm without asking. Then she gets a black bowl and before you know it she is washing your hands. In the black bowl she shows you the oil that comes off your hands and arms. Then she will tell you to buy the sea salt. Next she will tell you your hands are too dry. Sell you some more lotion. On and on this goes till she does a sales pitch for each product in her booth. Watch out!!

Forget all the junky low quality stuff here specifically desinged and manufactured for outlet malls. Skip all that skin care nonsense too. Just go to the Plaza hotel and casino and live it up.... its just down the block"}
{"text":"The misters here don't work very well so when it's really hot it's unbearable to go. Also, the deals at the South mall are better. Same stores better prices. I probably would have enjoyed it better if it were an indoor mall."}
{"text":"The second time I came here, it was just ALL WRONG. Lesportsac and Juicy were the only interesting stores. Then again, I've been spoiled by Sawgrass Mills, so if you'll excuse my brief review. =)"}
{"text":"Ein Dorf in der Stadt, das ist das Las Vegas Premium Outlets. Und zwar ein Kaufdorf, bei welchem man von einem Haus zum n√§chsten geht, bis man immer noch mehr T√ºten in der Hand h√§lt und nicht mehr wei√ü wohin damit. F√ºr uns Deutsche sind die Klamotten in den USA sowieso schon billiger, hier gibt es aber auch noch Abschl√§ge auf die sonst √ºblichen Preise. Die gro√üen Marken sind alle vertreten, Hersteller wie Nike, Puma, Adidas, Converse, Levis, American Apparel, dazu auch noblere Marken wie Armani und andere. Ja, auch bei Armani habe ich zugeschlagen, ein Sommerj√§ckchen f√ºr unter 100 Dollar, da konnte ich nicht nein sagen, obwohl ich ja sonst nicht so der Markenfetischist bin. Und Chucks von Converse gibt es hier f√ºr etwa ein Viertel von dem, was sie bei uns kosten. Ich sage jetzt mal, wenn man eine Komplettausstattung ben√∂tigt und einen halbwegs g√ºnstigen Flug bekommt, ist es vermutlich g√ºnstiger, nach Las Vegas zum Shoppen zu fahren als sich die Sachen bei uns zu kaufen."}
{"text":"Stopped by a few weeks ago because my wife wanted to do some shopping. On our last visit we hit up Coach, Crocs, Godiva, Nike, Adidas, Banana Republic, and Michael Kors. There were some deals to be had so we got some stuff for ourselves and we checked a couple people off of our Christmas Shopping List. 

Overall, they have a great variety of stores and an indoor food court. You cant go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Nice outlet mall with nice choices but packed with noisy customers all looking to shop."}
{"text":"Great outlet mall with tons to offer. I love the Nike outlet, they have great deals throughout the store. A definite must if you're in Vegas. The worst experience I have had here was back almost ten years ago when I flew to Vegas to meet a girl I had never met but only talked to on the phone. Let me tell you this girl lived on her stupid phone and she snorted like a pig when she laughed. The only enjoyment I got that day was going to the Nike outlet and buying a SWEET pair Nike Shox. But anyways this place is a lot of fun and great place to bring kids since they have a giant mary go round in the middle of the mall. I don't get to Vegas often but next time I go I am defiantly stopping here to do some shopping."}
{"text":"I love this outlet because all the high-end stores have an outlet here! Also, they opened up a Lululemon outlet here recently and I was able to get 2 sports bras for $30 each!

The parking structures are great because they have lights on top to show you if the parking spot is available.

We came on a weekday during off-season and were very happy that the crowds were at a minimum! 

I highly recommend the North outlets because they are nicer than the other ones."}
{"text":"For an outlet mall, this is one of the best I've been to. The wifey and I always make a point to stop here to pick up some nice gear for the Vegas nightlife. We can both find stores we like to shop at with ease.

They've got pretty much all the major name brands here, like Tommy Hilfiger, Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Nike, Adidas, PacSun, Charlotte Russe, Calvin Klein, Coach, and many more!(full list- http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/store_listing.asp?id=58). Whatever brand you are into, most likely you can find it here.  Lots of really good deals around too!

There's plenty of parking available but I suggest trying to find a spot in the parking structure to keep your car cool during the summer months.  It's also an outdoor mall so if you are there too long you may get a nice farmer's tan. Oh and the Food Court is crap. Might as well save your money for something better to grub on in Vegas. 

It's definitely a good place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Plus, it's nice to come home with something tangible than just spending all our money in the casinos."}
{"text":"Since were staying at the Cali in downtown, and had driven by the mall on the way, I wanted to check it out before checking out of town. They have a wide array of stores and with us getting there around 7:30 and it closing at 9:00 pm on Saturday, I had my plan of attack. Look at directory, see stores I like, rush in and out. It usually works. I wanted to start with Burberry, but the guys didn't, so we walked around and then I ditched them. Went to Banana Republic, Puma, Nike, WhiteIBlack, A/X, Ferragamo and made quick purchases. I think I did pretty well and didn't break the bank too much. What is weird about this outdoor shopping plaza is that it looks like it's not quite open yet. It was dark already, but they didn't have any of the courtesy lamps on in the walkaways. So you'd turn down one way or another and it'd be kind of dark. A little creepy if you're a girl shopping alone. Good thing I always have my pepper spray handy. 

Saw the comments from everyone about the heat. Don't go during the day. At night on a Saturday, this place was completely dead. No one in sight, except for a few stragglers here and there. I was overheating a little bit since it was a tad humid, but doesn't everyone sweat a tad when they're trying to cram in a bunch of stores in 90 minutes?

Good stores, good prices and all the salespeople I ran into were really nice. Will go back when I have more time! Never made it into Burberry. Probably a good thing, though, since I would've dropped a few more Benjis."}
{"text":"I went only for the Gap Outlet where I can spend $50 and walk out with a new wardrobe of basics. Tanks, jeans, shirts, shoes. Great deals on guys boxers and jeans too! I really love the rush of finding something that you couldn't find in your size when it was in the regular Gap stores! yay!

The rest of the outlet was scary. It was like a ghost town when we went and the other stores did not appeal to me at all. Their American Eagle wasn't even an outlet. I know they are cheap already but i want to see outlets in an outlet shopping center!! 

Coach outlet.......oooooooohhhhhhh
Kate Spade......aaaaahhhhhhhhhh

i was a bad girl."}
{"text":"This shopping center is relatively new and there are a lot of shops to check out. Make sure you bring your own water bottle of some sort because it is an outdoor shopping center. Especially in the summer when the weather gets hot, its important to stay hydrated.

Sales were pretty good too when I visited during 4th of july weekend. They have a variety of brands from Adidas, Nike, Pacsun, Banana Republic, Kenneth Cole etc"}
{"text":"Great prices on the merchandise, but forget the food court.  Bring water or else you have to pay nearly $3 for one 16 ounce bottle. The food ain't so tasty."}
{"text":"Everything seemed way overpriced, like normal department store sales.  There are some good stores and some good merchandise, but the prices are not really outlet prices.

Parking wasn't too bad and things were clean.  3 stars.  I wouldn't go out of your way to go unless you really need something."}
{"text":"This is like Las Vegas version of Disneyland minus the roller coaster. It's an outdoor shopping center. There's like 150 stores with all your favorite brands like Nike,Levi,Ecko,Quiksilver,Vans,Reebok,Juicy Couture,Gap,Disney Brooks Brothers,,Coach,Billabong, Zales, Bose, Fossil  and so many more.It gets  super HOT in the summer & super cold in our 3 days of winter. What do you expect? Great deals can be found here-$5 T-shirts, $20 Warm-Up suits at Nike, 2 prs of Nike's for $60. Best time is Holiday sales. Save big $$$. I love this place & everyone tourists should make it a destintation on their trip."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Vegas we always get excited to come here. Until we get there. 

There is something about it that makes us always forget get that while they do have factory outlet stores of a lot of cool stores, this place is a dump! 

The food court alone is enough to make me gag but, with all of the carts in the middle trying to hound you, you have no choice but to quickly turn into a store to get away from them, then while shopping in that store you realized, that everything is 30% off of a 50% markup, and then they slap the word \"outlet\" and then stand back and collect money. 

I realized this trip that everything they have there you can either find online, or at the same price as the regular stores, it's only worth going if there is a store there that you don't have where you live, but then you have to figure out if it's worth the $20 each way cab ride."}
{"text":"10 minutes away from the strip on the freeway and maybe 5 minutes from downtown Las Vegas. They have a lot of stores and selections: a bit of everything. I came here in December so it's holiday shopping season and it's busy. I can't say for regular months. The outlet looked clean and well maintained. There's plenty of parking spaces and valet parking."}
{"text":"One of the best premium outlets around! Every time I come to Vegas, I make a stop to shop here. It's a big outdoor shopping complex a few miles north of the main Vegas strip. Personally, I think this outlet has better brands compared to the outlet south of the strip. They have a variety of stores including high end brands such as Burberry, Theory, Helmut Lang, Carolina Herrera, and Salvatore Ferragamo. They have the best selection and prices as well. Make sure to give yourself at least 3-4 hours to shop around. 

The only negative is that it gets really hot in the summer and walking around outside can be difficult. But most of the stores blast the AC! 

Tip: Yelpers don't forget to check in or use your AAA card to get a free VIP coupon book (extra savings on top of the already discounted prices)."}
{"text":"Parking here is tough, but not impossible they've opened a large garage recently you just have to sit and wait and possibly walk a while from where you park. Great selection of stores, new restaurants. Expect to walk, but if the day's nice, it's nice."}
{"text":"Love this mall. The food court sucks but it's a food court at a mall, not meant to be fancy. One tip to help you save money.....take the monorail to LVH then at LVH get in their cab line and take a cab to the mall. Your fare should be around $15 plus tip. One time it was 10:05 and Puma had not opened yet. A lady got all belligerent over it. It was shopping and a show."}
{"text":"Went to the Coach Store. They have a large selection and everything is almost half of the original price. The store was very crowded with tourist so its hard to get to look at everything. There is no waiting for checkout. The staff is very helpful. 

Parking is crazy. It took me 30 min to find a parking space. I recommend you come early for easy parking and to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"One thing I could say about this outlet was, SPYDER!!! I don't see many outlet that has SPYDER outlet. During this visit, I don't really need anything from them, but it's nice to see their items were on DISCOUNT! Yes, I'm a snowboarder and SPYDER is so expensive on retail, at least $350 and above, except kids size. This outlet has shown me that I can have it for about $200 or less, sweet deals! 

Loved the outdoor shopping and the watermist. For the first time, I see no lines at Coach store either. The parking structure is a bonus, plenty enough for those Vegas visitors. Located just right by the freeway, you can't miss it! It was my first time coming here 2 weekends ago and I'd say, I'll be back in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"An outdoor outlet. They have a great variety of name brand outlets.  I recommend stopping by if you in the mood for discount shopping in Vegas. Parking is in a free parking structure.

{"text":"I really do like this outlet mall, it is way better than the south outlet! The whole mall has great shops and yummy restaurants. I also should say, the mall looked really clean and beautiful. When walking around, I mostly walked in shade, loved it! All the shops are either high-end or low-end, there are many choices of shops. To get here, I really do recommend taking an Uber to your hotel. Plus, if you have a car, the parking lot has those lights that tell you if the spot is available or not. I'd so go here instead of the south outlet."}
{"text":"These are the best outlets by far I've been at. First of all, you will find all kinds of stores from Armani to Vince, Diesel to Pandora, John Varvatos and Uggs. I try to check these stores every time I come in to Vegas, and always leave stocked up with shopping bags. Parking is located conveniently right by plaza, you need to walk only 5-6 steps. Two Starbucks are on premises as well as Food Court. Anyway, this is a great place to shop. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is where I do all clothing and shoe shopping for my family.  I love the selection of stores and can find everything needed for myself, husband, and 2 young kids.  I have found it is a lot less crowded during the week or later in the evening on the weekends (as opposed to during the day on weekends).  I can only think of two things that are a little on the downside.  I wish Stride Rite would have not closed.  Also, the cigarette smoke does seem to be quite heavy here.  It would be nice if smoking was limited to certain areas, but I'm not sure if there is anything the mall can do about it.  I will always be a return customer though!"}
{"text":"I must say I do enjoy the LV Premium Outlets. 

Although it is outdoors, I might still find myself heading here in the middle of the summer just based off the fact they have stores I 1. enjoy and 2. actually have decent prices.

Parking can be a hassle, but there are two garages, so pick your poison between garages. Be forewarned: it is outdoors, so summer months could have you sweating between stores. 

A lot of tourists. TONS of tourists. It is not a \"local\" place by any means.

Still, gotta love cheap shopping. The structural layout is actually pretty decent and the signage is helpful. There's an eatery and a Starbucks that is always busy. 

I think overall this a good premium outlet."}
{"text":"L o v e. T h e s e. O u t l e t s. 

Once upon a time I grew up in a fashion deprived city. The nearest shops were hours away. I've never been much of an on-line shopper, so I had to know where all the nearest shops I liked were (Cure? LV Premium Outlets).

Shops here that I love: 
- J. Crew 
- French Connection (R.I.P. It's dead now but had been on my list of favorites for years)
- Kate Spade (another bag please!)
- Banana Republic 
- GAP (even though the factory stores tend to resemble Old Navy at times, what do you expect for factory prices?) 
-Ed Hardy (hahahahahahahah j/k!!!!)

I like the outdoor shop locations, but be warned, it can be bloody hot in summer (they have mist machines, but when its 100+ degrees out it evaporates immediately) . 

The food court is small (only 5? eateries) and during busy summer months seating can be hard to find. Outside is an ice cream shop and Godiva, so if Chinese Orange chicken or 1,000 calorie pizza slices don't appeal you can eat chocolate. 

They keep the facilities clean & they have covered parking (makes all the difference in that kind of heat -hot leather seats & short skirts don't mesh well). They also have valet and the area stays pretty clean.  Go there. Today. This weekend. Tomorrow. Just GO. Anyone up for a road trip???"}
{"text":"They have some great stores here and I have to say the sales are pretty good too.  The great thing about this place is there is a parking garage so you don't have to park in the vast field of black-top asphalt.  The one thing about this outlet that stands out to me is the misting fans they use to cool people off.  The heat didn't bother me at all and it was 108 degrees and I was actually feeling cool.  The one is Florida doesn't have the misting fans and it could be 90 degrees outside and it could be unbearable!!!  Maybe the difference is in the humidity.

The Coach store offers the 30% off coupons at all their outlet locations.  The Vegas and Orlando locations are the biggest I have ever seen.  The selections are great and I love how you got to fight all the Chinese or Korean people buying the purses, so they can take it home to go make knock-offs to sell for just as high of a price.  Honestly, how many men do you see buying 30-40 bags??  I doubt they are cross dressers or they are buying it for their wife or girlfriend.  LOL"}
{"text":"I like the Vegas Premium Outlet a lot.  If they have a store you like, you'll like it.  If they don't, you won't.  That's the whole thing to outlets I think.  If there are stores that you actually like to shop at, you'll be excited to browse through and find things that you like.  If you don't like a store, no matter how much you convince yourself to like it because it's so much cheaper, it's not going to happen.

Each time I come here, I really only go for two stores.  The Coach Outlet and the Guess Outlet.  The Coach Outlet always has a really good selection, including a lot of things from Coach Retail.  (Where I live, the Coach Outlets suck).. Also, I always liked Guess Outlet, but I no longer have that near home, so I get excited to come to this one.  This Guess Outlet is also pretty big.  

The Premium Outlets itself is nice and well maintained.  There's also a food court. Overall, if they have a store you like, I would definitely check it out."}
{"text":"One of the better malls in Vegas except that its outside which everyone knows that its hot as Hades in the summer. I do like it for the fact that it has a lot of cool shops that I like to check out. The place has a nice circular pattern layout but with the addition of the new wing a few years back makes you back track some."}
{"text":"I haven't been to too many outlet malls but this one is probably the best out of all of them. It's an outdoor mall and it's not too small or extremely large. It's also pretty easy to navigate once you make a few rounds; I think it pretty much loops around in a complete circle. When we went it was moderately crowded but still able to navigate freely, and it was on a Tuesday afternoon. Parking was okay, although we got kinda lost initially since this was our first time here. They have a 4 story (?) parking deck right next to the mall.

They have plenty of stores ranging for MK to Pacsun to Charlotte Russe and everything in between. I was able to find some good deals at GAP and O'Nelil but unfortunately my gf couldn't find anything :(

The ratio of higher end/designer stores to your typical chain dept. store was like 10 to 3 so if you're more into that fancy stuff, then this place has many options. There were plenty of good deals going on when we went as well.

The only downside is their limited food options.. we ended up just getting an Auntie Annes pretzel that seemed like it was sitting out for a bit.."}
{"text":"Exit 41B on the highway. Typical outlet location. Nothing special beside the problems of finding parking. Must get there early to be the crowd."}
{"text":"I have been here many times before. But 5 years ago, I remember this place having lots of good deals. Lots of cheap things. Now its not so much. I think I will be better off going to the Portland Premium Outlets.

The place has expanded alot. But again there are so much traffic at this place. Parking has improved a lot. They have sensored parking spaces. This means that if you leave the parking spot, the system will update itself and show how many spot is available. I like this. So fancy. As a tip don't go after 1pm because parking will be crazy.

Their coupon book is fancy. Its a booklet. Not a pamphlet like other places. So there are more deal. Again I did notice Portland has more better deals.

Maybe Vegas is about going to the strip not really shopping. I was disappointed. I expected more."}
{"text":"Close to the strip. 
I drove here before and always have to fight for parking. 
This time, I rode the Express bus. I was zipping in and out. =)
 
Tips: I bought ticket but no one was checking and people just hop on and off. So, I am not the Express is free or not. Just so you know... 

After shopping, I rode the bus to the Fremont Street Experience. It was perfect.

Question:  I always see people shop with thier luggage (yes, the one you check in at the airport) in this mall.  Why is that?"}
{"text":"Average small mall - had a couple of good stores I like: Guess & Bebe. Food court wasn't really a food court very limited food choices. Overall it is an ok mini mall."}
{"text":"Good selection of shops but way too crowded with tourists. The parking is a nightmare and is now chargeable $5 for non-Nevada residents. For this reason alone I will never return. Most of the shops have discounts from inflated prices or simply have designs that are made for the outlet in the first place - very few true bargains here in my experience."}
{"text":"I hate to be the party pooper among the sea of raving 4 and 5 star reviews, but I just never am too excited about this particular outlet. I feel the stores don't have much to offer.

Even the Polo Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, and Burberry here are whatever for me.

A funny memory I have of this outlet was once I was wearing a green Lacoste polo, cream khakis, and matching white Lacoste flat sneakers with green trim and was inside the Lacoste store, just aimlessly browsing with my dad. About 3 people came up to asking about the sale and prices, etc etc because they assumed I was an employee there. Hahaha

Ok and probably the only reason I'd ever come to this outlet is to eat at Makino, the Japanese buffet. The prices are reasonable and the food is GOOD."}
{"text":"It's outlet shopping! what else is needs to be said?

The unfortunate thing is this place is outdoors so during the summer it's super hot and you just keep hopping from store to store to cool down. They have misters on to help with the heat.

I usually hit up Coach, Banana Republic, Gap and Ann Taylor. The list of stores is here: https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/store_listing.asp?id=58

They have a pretty impressive list. A lot more high end stores than the other outlet in town. You'd have to go to the one in Primm to see similar stores (however, even the one in Primm is starting to lose stores to this location)"}
{"text":"I only use this mall when I truly need something. Like right now, I need work shoes and I use Sketcher Shape Ups! Got here and they don't open till 10am!!!! I don't know if it's just Sunday or every day but no stores are open and there are plenty of people pulling handles.... IMO with the lag in the economy right now if I was a store owner/manager and saw someone trying to come in I would rush to the door to let them in....

The last time I was here was for Black Friday and it was INSANE I had to get black Levi's and the sale was pretty decent. I recommend getting here REALLY early if you're planning on coming during Black Friday..."}
{"text":"Has all the good expensive stores! Burbury, Kate Spade, Coach... as well as Banana, Bebe, Disney and Fossil.  Nice wide variety.  Nice outdoor mall to walk around.  When it's crazy hot they have some misters that help and a starbucks to  quench your thirst.  One of my favorite Vegas outlet malls."}
{"text":"It's a nice outdoor mall with premium brands, just don't expect spectacular bargains. Like many \"outlets\" the listed price usually is marked up and then given an impressive discount to make it seem like you're getting a great deal when in fact you're paying the retail price."}
{"text":"Das zweite Outlet Shoppingcenter in Las Vegas, was mit g√ºnstigen Preisen und Angeboten lockt. Der Eink√§ufer sollte sich bewusst sein, das Outletzentren im Regelfall Auslaufmodelle und speziell f√ºr dieses Segment produzierte Waren der Markenhersteller anbieten. Dieser Verkaufstempel ist offen gestaltet, man ist unter freiem Himmel unterwegs und flaniert zwischen den Ladengesch√§ften. In beiden Outlets dieses Betreibers gibt es jeweils ein Couponbuch, das Sparpotential beginnt aber oft erst bei Eink√§ufen √ºber 150$ in den jeweiligen Gesch√§ften. Preisunterschiede zwischen den beiden \"Premium\" Einkaufszentren konnte ich nicht feststellen. Aus meiner Sicht, gen√ºgt es jedoch eines zu besuchen, in meinem Fall eher die √ºberdachte Version nahe dem Flughafen, da es bei den lokalen Temperaturen angenehmer ist."}
{"text":"What can I say: its an outlet mall that has brand name stores. Good stuff to be had if you find a good deal and the parking garage is a big plus. I love the fact that they actually have a L'Occitane en Provence store."}
{"text":"I can get my shop on here. 

Really, all my favorite places are here, and they're all cheaper than they are at the mall. Plus it's like 10 minutes away from my parent's house, and there's quick freeway access, so it's easy to get to!

I wear a lot of boring clothes for work. That is, a lot of plain button-up shorts and pants and stuff. This place allows me to get all my good business casual work clothes for a deal. They have a J Crew, which is a personal favorite, Nike (sup running shoes!?), Banana Republic, and a Gap. So I pretty much get the whole gamut of needs in one place. I love that I can pop into this place once every few months, and be set for a while. 

There are cons here, though. Parking is nuts. I hate it. It's probably better to park at the Clark County building across the way than it is to park in their lot. Also, it's an outdoorsy-type place, so shopping here isn't the best when it's 110 out. Also, I can come here and spend more money than I meant to. Thrift fail.

I'm gonna keep coming to this place. It's closer than the Belz outlet or the stateline place, though both of those place are ok, too."}
{"text":"Best outlet in Vegas. Parking lot can be very stressful but they do have the red and green light sensor on each spot, so you can see if the aisle has an open space.

They have improved and expanded a lot of stores since the last time I came. You can find all the major outlet stores here and then some. Can get really hot in the summer. Also gets very crowded after noon time."}
{"text":"Best sale when there is a sale! Although parking is hard when there's a lot of people. Very good deals"}
{"text":"For shoppers this is a great place to go.  They have shops that most outlets don't have.  They have a black and white market that my was really want to go to."}
{"text":"LOVE this outlet!! For people who loves to shop and won't mind spending the whole day shopping, this is the place to be! GREAT sales and its so big that I got there noonish and left at closing time!

Best part is that they have a pretty good selection of food choice when hunger kicks in after a long day of shopping!"}
{"text":"Gambling is not my thing, shopping is.  And when I come to Vegas, this outlet is a must-stop (must-shop?).  The bonus is that it's so close to downtown, which is where we stayed twice this year.

I love this outlet for the sheer sake of having a LeSportsac store.  Sure, I love the LVs, the Guccis, the Tods, but I'm a mom on the run and during the week, I like to carry my junk in a durably cute and casual manner.

Also, because I usually come here during the holidays (non-Christmas ones), I ALWAYS find great deals.  I recently came here during the Thanksgiving weekend, and got a lot of stuff for 1/3 of the listed prices (go mommy, it's yo berfday...).  And because this is a Premium Outlet, you can print out additional coupons as well as get a voucher for a VIP coupon book (claim at information center near Adidas) via the VIP Club.  You can also use your AAA card if you have one to get the VIP coupon book.  Otherwise, you'd have to fork out $5 for one (and people do pay for them, believe it or not).

So, I may not fill up my wallet with winnings from gambling, but I do empty it out and fill up my trunk with purchases."}
{"text":"To me, an outlet usually means getting quality products at deeply discounted prices and that is what I expect walking in. Since I have been duped in the past by phony outlet centers like this one, I always come prepared with my Iphone scanner to make sure I am getting a deal. 
 
After browsing around for more than two hours in the 100+ degree heat, I can state for certain that this place is nothing more than an ordinary mall with the word OUTLET written on the sign, with the exception of handful of stores of course. 

The only stores worth really visiting are Polo RL, Lacoste, and the Famous Footware as pretty much everything else was overpriced.

Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I was debating for awhile about purchasing the 2016 Agenda. I called 3 days prior to showing up and it was 60% off, when I made it to the store, there was only one left and the promo went down ro 40% off. I was in the store debating for about 15 minutes. I gave the agenda back to the Manager and said I'd changed my mind. She seemed genuinely concerned about what my issue was and wanted to make sure I was pleased! She honored the 60% off and was extremely gracious and professional. My cashier Jacqueline was awesome! The store was perfect and I highly recommend shopping here. Such a great experience"}
{"text":"I LOVE coming to this outlet when I'm in town.  I always find great sales.  Parking can sometimes be a hassle when trying to find one under roof covers. Also, the elevators are super slow and stuffy..especially with the Vegas heat.  But still worth going to shop there!"}
{"text":"I prefer the North outlets over the South, in terms of store selection. They have more designer stores, such as Theory, Dolce and Gabbana, and Burberry. The food court is pretty basic, but across from the food court is a pretty tasty fudge store. Despite it being an outdoor mall, there's enough shade that you don't get too overheated."}
{"text":"Great place to shop when you're here in Vegas! Prefer this outlet as compared to other outlets as it is smaller, easy to walk around to get the things you want as well as good variety of shops. Got quite a few good deals from a couple of shops. Simply love this place! Parking is free and it is conveniently located next to the shopping area. Makes it easy to lugged your loots back into the car after your shopping spree."}
{"text":"My favorite go to outlet when I come to Vegas. Got so many good deals at Kate Spade 70% off everything. What a steal!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas with the fam, we always come here #truestory

NORTH is the better one of the two outlets (the other is SOUTH) because of its larger selection of stores, BUT the price you pay is a greater hustle-and-bustle of tourists and annoyingly slow walkers milling around the outlets. They have great stores with awesome discounts from Calvin Klein to Kate Spade and Banana Republic. Watch out for the HUGE foreign tourist traps like Burberry, Coach, Kate Spade, STARBUCKS (HAHA), and Nautica, just to name a few...

There is a good range of people who come here to shop from the locals to huge tour buses of foreigners to young kids looking to take a break from the Strip scene. 

This isn't my favorite place to go because of all the secondhand smoke that is destined to happen, but anyone and everyone can definitely find a great deal at the store of their choice."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in Las Vegas and would like to go shopping for some premium items at a bargain, be sure to check out the Las Vegas Premium Outlets near downtown. It is definitely worth your while if you want to get some retail therapy done. It offers a great array of shops in a well laid out manner and rather easy parking options that make it a good spot to shop!

The center features a plethora of clothing retailers for men, women, and children. From Banana Republic to PacSun, Ed Hardy to Gap, they have them all. They also feature a good selection of accessories, kitchen, and bag shops. You can certainly pick up some new things for you, some gifts for friends, and the bag to pack all of it in. Note, it is an open-air complex so be prepared on those hot summer days!

The parking lot is generally full when I've gone, but if you drive around for a bit, a stall is bound to open up. If not, check out the structure since there seems to be better chances to park there, plus you car will be out of the blazing sun! Be sure to hide your valuables since tourists do frequent this spot and I'd imagine could be an easy target for questionable individuals. 

Food options are rather limited with the food court fare or Makino Chaya, which actually is pretty decent if you are willing to spring the wallet strings a little. So plan accordingly...

For the cheap shopper in all of us, Las Vegas Premium Outlet is certainly a good choice to check out!"}
{"text":"Outdoor malls in Las Vegas are a bit tough for me. Either too hot or too cold to shop but if you like the outdoor concept for malls this place is for you.

Great outlet stores to select from. They also have Cheesecake Factory here so that's a good chain restaurant for an outlet mall. 

Kiosk vendors can be a bit pushy, some very cheesy vendors for the kiosks but that's expected for outlets would just expect a bit more with the stores that are around.

Little Yelp tip, they have a coupon passport book here if you check in. Some pretty good deals inside. Make sure you pick yours up at customer service near valet."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We come here about every other time we come to Vegas.  It's convenient and it has many of the high end stores we like to shop."}
{"text":"They charge FIVE dollars for parking to non residents now! This outlet is a hit or miss. Sometimes you'll find a lot, sometimes you won't."}
{"text":"I went to both south and north and I liked this one better. if it's a cold or rainy day, then go to south but if it's a sunny day go to north. north offers more products while south ranout of many things north had. come early to catch parking right infront to avoid those big parking lots. fully outdoors beautiful for a sunny day."}
{"text":"Came here for the Reebok store. Got greeted as we entered and later asked if we needed help. But already found what I was looking for, 4E shoes! Yes!

Checked out the Coach store. Didn't buy anything.

Picked up some goodies at Harry and David. Offered some samples.....mmmm!

Next up Dooney and Bourke. Got a bag for my gf's friend. Staff was very helpful."}
{"text":"Pros: there tons of high-end stores at this outlet for your shopping pleasure. I've been here many times and always find something awesome. Just a casual stroll can take up some time because of the many stores at this outlet. There is a free parking garage and easy access to the outlet as you walk across this bridge and you are there. 

Cons: as with outdoor malls, it can get really hot in Vegas so stay hydrated and find shade where you can! 

Overall: if you have a free half a day to a day, I would recommend coming to this outlet from some good deals in shopping!"}
{"text":"Stop at the info booth & check on some theater last minute ticket deals.  Get the map here which will save you time roaming around getting lost looking for the 2 directories they have.  90% of the security guards are working the Parking Structure.  Parking is a nightmare here and the cab lines are long, but you will find some of the car service drivers working the line to take you back you back to the hotel.  

DKNY, BCBG,  & Ted Baker are some of my favorites at this mall.  The BCBG carries some of the BCBG Herve Leger dresses and shoes which I have never seen at an Outlet.  I scored some great dresses at the 50% post Holiday sale. Ted Baker with the signature shirts with the cuff links are always a sharp clean style that is great for men and women, if you wear size 0-4, you may find a cute dress here.  I deeply dislike the overly embroidered Ed Hardy scroll over type shirts that scream douche bag or on my way to the Rodeo, so guys don't stop at this store.

This is a great place to get a quick outfit if you have flew over Spirit Air and was allowed only the clothes off your back."}
{"text":"EH, this place isn't that great. I like outlet shopping but so many places don't live up to it. This is one of those places."}
{"text":"I like the outlets lots of variety of shops to choose from. I'll shop at Coach, Reebok and The Loft to name a few stores."}
{"text":"Left the mall with heavy packages and lots of early Xmas shopping completed. Could've stayed longer but pretty much reached the boyfriend's shopping time limit. Got good deals at Michael Kors (40% additional reg priced items), quicksilver had buy one get one 1/2 off back packs and the stance socks were pretty much 2 for 1. Lulu lemon also had great specials of the day and everything is marked down. the salesperson gave me an extra 10% off of I would \"bust a move\" for 10 secs so of course I got my dance on. The VIP shoppers booklet is available for AAA members and you get extra discounts at at least 1/2 of the stores. I used it for 10% off motherhood and the Disney store. Nike outlet is hit or miss but specials can allow you to buy shoes at $40. Great weather makes it even better for an outdoor mall"}
{"text":"Always finding great deals here. Got deals at Oakley, Banana Republic and Disney.  Lot of shops so just go for it!"}
{"text":"This is THE best outlet mall in vegas (and quite possibly the best outlet i've been to)!!!! With tons of stores, there's really something for everyone. I also liked the layout - all the stores I wanted to hit were grouped up in the same section. Some highlights:

- snagged a pair of Juicy terry pants for $15!!! what a steal!
- they have THE ONLY Ted Baker outlet in the US! I made friends with one of the guys there who happened to also work at the one in the Forum Shops. He also mentioned that store is a test pilot to see if they should open more in the states...so GO and BUY STUFF!! He was also psyched that I decided to buy this teal wool toggle coat that i loooved and fit me perfectly. 
- got a new pair of chucks for $40 but my freakin friend with midget feet snagged a pair of kids' ones for $10 since they were buy one get one half off!!
- my friends also went crazy at Banana Republic. between the already great discounts and the extra friends & family coupon this weekend they each dropped over $100 there. 

I am now broke as a joke but let me tell you I do not regret any of it. If you've got the cash, take advantage of all the sales!! Christmas is right around the corner..."}
{"text":"Before you blow all your money away in vegas.

Go Shopping! they have all the brands and lots and lots of specialty stores. 

It is a great way to spend the afternoon in vegas. its clean, safe, free parking, 

if its hot they have some unique outdoor seating with fans place on top w water misting.

dont blow all your money away in the casinos. come shop here b4!"}
{"text":"Tip:  Before you head out, take a look at the directory, and head their earlier on as opposed to later as it gets busy.

This outdoor \"outlet\" mall looks nicer when you're actually walking around where the stores are as opposed to circling the parking lot.  And if you were decided between South Vs. this Outlet, go to this one!!!

There's a nice mix of the typical stores, but also some higher-end stores I was surprised to see at an Outlet Mall.  I'm from Toronto and we just don't have this variety here!  Sadly, some of them I was unable to get to.

Another surprise at an outlet mall was that there was actually a sense of GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Maybe they were on commission, but who cares, they seemed sincere and like they actually wanted to help.  Shout-outs to the guy at Adidas and helpful, sweet salesgirl at Sunglass Hut!

I cannot comment about the food sitch because I went there stuffed, so didn't eat there, but it's probably all the usual chain places."}
{"text":"The reason I LOVED this mall is because when you wear a size 11 shoe, your shopping choices are limited.  Now I have hundreds of shoes but it took a lot of work to build a collection like I have.  Most size 8's can go to a shoe store any time and buy what they want.

So my point was that almost every shoe store at this mall had my size!  And not just ugly granny shoes, but really cute shoes!  On top of that they have a Burberry and a Michael Kors along with a good selection of other stores."}
{"text":"TIP: If you're on vacation in Las Vegas, try to avoid shopping here during the weekends during the daytime ... sheer madness!!!  Then, you're fighting to shop here with the other tourists AND locals, UGH!

Come here during the weekday or even during the evening on a weeknight.  We spend the last day of our trip coming here on a Tues. night at 8 PM and it was dead - woo-hoo!

Boyfriend scored lots of good deals at the Ecko store:

- 2 t-shirts for $20
- 2 t-shirts for $30
- Cargo shorts for $15 

This is as good as it gets!  

We have one Ecko store in Honolulu, HI and they sell it at Macys', but you can't get these kind of prices.

Was able to find parking in the regular lots across the street.  We tried to come here on a weekend day (Sat. afternoon) & even the huge parking garage was filled!!  What was worse is there was a parking garage employee standing after the entrance telling us we had to turn around since da garage was packed ... umm, that's retarded!  Why not have this person standing in FRONT OF THE PARKING GARAGE ... that way, he can prevent people from driving into da friggen thing and having to waste time by turning around.  Argh."}
{"text":"good food like it aloot price was good"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm definitely coming back. They have a lot of good quality stores and a food court. It reminded me of an outlet located in Washington. I was able to purchase a bag and a wallet for a cheap price. Just imagine 60% off and an additional 20%?!"}
{"text":"Shopping and enjoying the stores is cool.. parking is TERRIBLE!!! It took us 45 minutes to go from the 4th floor to the 3rd floor.  Plus another 20 to get from the 2nd to the exit. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"It's a nice place, but it's not connected like the south outlets, so you have to walk in and out of the store. It's inconvenient when the weather is 100 degrees outside. We were here for about 20 minutes and just left cause it got too hot and there were no sales. Clean facilities though. You also get $5 for checking in!"}
{"text":"We always visit this outlet on semi annual trips to Las Vegas.  We know what stores hold interest for us so we do not spend a lot of time browsing.  Of the 2 outlets, north and south, this is by the nicer one though it is more difficult to get to than the south outlets for people without a car.  There has been a recent expansion that added a few nicer stores and the availability of garage during the hotter months represent a real plus."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best outlets I've been to in awhile. The Ralph Lauren polo store has the deepest discounts I've ever seen anywhere. Sooooooo happy I found this place! Nice that they have a Cheesecake Factory too so you can grab a hearty meal after all the walking around!"}
{"text":"Was helped very much and great customer service from Ethan. He helped explain all items and deals to help me with a great choice on the survival kit. Ask for Ethan if u come in."}
{"text":"I personally think  that this outlet is better than the South outlet. Only reason I dock off a point is because it is an outside outlet and can get super hot."}
{"text":"Guest service is horrible!!! I was at Las Vegas Premium outlet on April 28 to get coupon book and redeem $25 gift card that exclusive for members. Guest service staffs are very unhelpful when I asked questions about gift card and coupon book. The staffs was just saying, they don't know what I'm talking even I show the promo email. Staffs even bother check the details for customers. Also the customer service staff refused to give out the coupon book. The reason I get is I have to print out the copy, unlike I typically just need to show my membership via device. I mean... seriously how the travelers in Vegas would get easy access for printer. 

Either this company doesn't honor their promotion or simply need to provide better training to employees."}
{"text":"I liked this outlet but I didn't really find anything that made me squeal. My mother did buy me the cutest Coach purse for my birthday so that gives mommy 5 stars and the actual mall a 3."}
{"text":"I have gotten several pairs of designer glasses here.  Best place to go when you want to save a few ducketts and still get real designer stuff.  

The last thing I got here was a new pair of Dior shades.  Saved $100 bucks."}
{"text":"Still the better place to shop of you can't get to the local indoor malls otherthan fashion mall. I always find something to buy when I'm here. So many choices you can't help but get at least one thing."}
{"text":"This one star is for the BULLSHIT SECURITY SYSTEM of this place. Again, it is for the SECURITY SYSTEM. The outlet is cool.
Here is what happened: It was the last of my parents and I visiting Las Vegas and we went shopping at this outlet. When we got back, we found out our car was broke into. One of the side window of the passenger seats was smashed and my bags and shoes were jacked (It was a Jeep, so there was no trunk to hide our stuff). Then two securities came. To put it simply, there was no surveillance camera and they had no idea what to do. They just asked me to write down the statement of what had happened on a piece of paper and called the insurance company. They didn't even write down any contact information or their names as the securities who was in charged of this on that statement paper. They didn't even look like they wanted to help us. They also told us that the police stations were all closed. SOB."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of outlet malls and this one is by far the best one in Vegas. The only other outlet that compares in terms of number of quality stores is the Cabazon outlets in SoCal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Its nice to have a place to go with upscale outlet stores.  They have a lot of good stores and it is outdoors which you can love or hate depending on what time of year it is.

The CON is coming from the South traffic can get sticky getting up to Charleston and the place is always busy!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I found myself at this mall and realized that its actually pretty good. I have not been there in a few years and really enjoyed checking out the place.
It has some really great stores and spring is the time to walk around and shop here. Soon enough it will be to hot for outdoor malls.
They could use some more places to eat. The food court is kinda lame and the sushi place was not open when I was there.
They would get more stars if they had more food choices."}
{"text":"not bad...."}
{"text":"Awsome stuff! I always go to this place every year for black friday!"}
{"text":"A really nice outlet in Vegas!  Better than the one by the state line!   Come and check it out."}
{"text":"Certainly worth a visit if you're in town. This outlet houses a lot of designer stores and other favorites. I got here close to opening and it was already crowded. 

Well laid out mall and if you need to grab some lunch there is a fairly large food court with in and outdoor seating. (One sit down restaurant too). 

Stores were offering deep discounts the day I went. At the end of your shopping experience it would be surprising if you didn't come home with a few bargains in your bag."}
{"text":"My wife purse was cut and wallet was stolen.  Reported to mall security office and police dept.  Mall security office was so unprofessional and basically no help at all.  Never shop at this outlet.  Heard other people got their wallets and belonings stolen by security office who said we are lucky we didn't have anything more important.   Is this right?  We lost total over  $ 1000 worse cash and gift cards and etc and we are lucky???   Worst experience ever at the outlet...."}
{"text":"first, do not get this confused up with the other outlets. this one is about a mile away from the stratosphere. it's an outdoor outlet, so be prepared to run in and out of stores if you're there in the summer. I like the selection of stores they have. my favs are...

Dooney and Bourke, Coach
Banana, Gap, Old Navy
Bebe
Guess
BCBG
Jcrew
Aldo, Nine West

the food court is also yummy!"}
{"text":"BCBG outlet is a great find.  Imagine $300 dresses at $40!  My sister from England went crazy there.  Quiksilver has some great bargains too.  Better than overpriced shops at the Strip."}
{"text":"I prefer this place to the Forum shops a million times over.  Huge, huge variety of stores, awesome prices, and it never seems too busy.  I can spend an entire day here, if not longer, shopping and shopping and shopping.

This place is a nice break from all the casinos, buffets, and hotels on the strip."}
{"text":"Forget about the high end stores along the Strip.  When I want to shop in Vegas, I head to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets.  They have a great mix of stores that usually have pretty good deals going, including the biggest Coach factory store that I've seen.  They also have a huge food court area, which is nice.

Only complaint I have is that it can get really hot during the summer and it sucks walking store to store when it is over 100 degrees outside!  Maybe that's their ploy to get to stay inside the stores longer to escape the heat, lol."}
{"text":"Customer service is awfull in The Guess outlet store . I bought sandals here for $22.00 and they broke within 2 hours . I took them back and they made it seem like I was at fault .RUBY helped me and was very rude. I also bought perfume and she tried to give me a damaged box. I asked for a newer box and she made it seem like I was pulling her teeth. Spent over $300.00 there and will never go back . They lost a customer for sure."}
{"text":"Kinda small where I am from. Wish it was bigger. Just like most outlet places just average."}
{"text":"Perfect one stop shopping.  The stores I would highly recommend are:  Coach outlet, Michael Kors, Jockey, Sunglass Hut and some very good gourmet food places who sell spices, etc.  It is fairly close to the strip and what is so great is that you can walk outside - something we Canadians always appreciate.  I spend a full day there while hubby is on the golf course.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very bad. They take now 5 dollar parking !!!!
We will not support them and drive either to Primm or the south outlets...."}
{"text":"I recently found my new favorite Ted Baker dress here for an unbeatable price.  I can easily see myself making this a regular stop on my LV trips!  Aside from the parking fiasco (we ended up driving over a curb and parking in some dirt, which apparently is OK!), this place is great  :)

Plenty of shops, great deals, nice outdoor feel.  Maybe it's just that folks are nicer in LV than they are in LA, but I was super impressed by how calm and chill the shoppers are here -- It was the day after Christmas and nobody was yelling or pushing or being a general nuisance!  Way to go, civilized peeps!"}
{"text":"Tons of shopping centers of majority of the top brands in the USA. Parking is 180 degrees west of the outlet mall but still can be difficult at times. Decent prices and savings compared to other malls. I usually could find everything I need here."}
{"text":"I thought it was going to have better selections and more stores. I was surprised at how small it was. Nonetheless the place is fairly relaxing and clean."}
{"text":"This is a good outlet. They have several good shops.  The kids got several pairs a shoes.  I found some great deals at burberry.  the Coach store had a good selection.  If you look you will find good deals."}
{"text":"I buy all my purses here. today I was buying one for a friend. 

The staff is friendly, despite the craziness of people the place was clean and I walked out with a nice gift for 70 dollars!"}
{"text":"Ok so the shops here are actually not bad. I've found some good deals here. I like the Pac Sun....they have good shoe selections. However Robert Wayne Footwear...Not really outlet prices. Believe me I used to manage one of the stores in LA. Ask for a discount or mall discount. Even no tax to get your hookup. I like the kitchen gadget stores. The food court. Not so good. Try Makino if you like jumbo sized all you can eat sushi.  :) So the shops aren't so bad - Nike, Tommy, Ralph, Quicksilver. This is much better than the other outlet mall...."}
{"text":"Always find great STEALS here. I don't mind the heat. I'm not outside much as I am a hard core SHOPPER. My husband loves lacoste and FCUK which always has great bargains at this location. I usually load up on coach bags for presents throughout the year. (You know, you forgot someone's birthday? No big deal, you have an already wrapped coach bag in the closet!) 

Way better than those other outlets that are indoors. Plus if you go to the website www.premiumoutlets.com, sometimes there are good coupons in the VIP club."}
{"text":"I only gave it 4 stars because I usually end up buying wonderful things I don't need, but have to have. Oh well. And the fruits popsicle dude isn't there in the winter time."}
{"text":"A good variety of stores, the surroundings is pleasant. It could get a little crowded but I suppose that is the case with all premium outlets these days. Better than the one out of town, so if you are in Las Vegas and want to hit an outlet, this is the one to go to."}
{"text":"Love the mall here. The two parking lots got confusing ):  very clean mall, would definitely come back. Bought lots of clothes, very good clothing stores and great deals."}
{"text":"So you visit Vegas, and want to get your shopping on? The Strip and Crystals is too expensive for your taste? Enter Las Vegas Premium Outlets of the North!

Here's the shops that have the best deals by discounts that I've found:

+ Calvin Klein (hit or miss, but check the clearance rack)
+ Aldo (great shoes for a reasonable price)
+ GAP (found a pair of jeans for 60% off)
+ Banana Republic ($13 polos, tons of colors and sizes)
+ Coach for Men (clearance rack has the best deals, the rest of the store, so-so)

I ended up dropping a huge dime at the stores above before leaving Vegas after picking through deals on a busy Monday afternoon. One can only imagine how crazy busy this place gets on a weekend. There's a large parking garage, but to avoid the madness, try coming here on a weekday instead of the weekend. You can't beat the deals if you're willing to sort through them and wait in what can be long lines. If you're an outlet shopper, hit up LVPO of the North."}
{"text":"This wasn't quit what I had expected. I wouldn't classify it as a Outlet mall, well at least not the kind I'm use to in California. It was a nice outdoor Mall but they sure weren't outlet prices. It's a nice mix of high end (coach, juicy,burberry) and lower end (Rue21,Charlotte Russe)store, but again, I didn't notice any price differences from the regular stores. We went the day after Christmas and even then the deals weren't fantastic. The place was jam packed with people and it was crazy trying to maneuver around the crowds. I also hated being asked about 500 times \"where are you from?\" from the employees. so irritating!!!"}
{"text":"I prefer this outlet than the south. Their parking is very unique and the stalls actually tell you if it's vacant or not and how many are available on that floor.

There are a lot of branded retail stores and I swear I got lost maybe three times being there. 

My boyfriend and I are always here when we come to Las Vegas for vacation."}
{"text":"It's my first time at a Coach outlet and it looks huge! But nothing to my liking. The outlets are pretty big, so prepare to spend hours here."}
{"text":"Always make it a point to come here when I'm in town, especially when I have no time to shop back at home and can't find what I'm looking for. I always find it at the outlets and always score on such great deals! $6 for jean shorts from Guess? Sweet! Great selection of stores and brands, will be back again."}
{"text":"Didn't really need something but the prices here wetter too hard to resist. Clean space and very organized."}
{"text":"I could hardly wait to go to this premium outlet mall not too far from our hotel. I was ready to shop, but left disappointed that I left empty-handed after a few hours.

I stopped into Tory Burch, Coach, Coach for Men, Marc Jacobs, and Burberry.  Some of the shops had items specifically made for the outlet and didn't have the quality that I was hoping for.  

This was a nice break from the strip, but not very productive shopping wise."}
{"text":"id like more sales on a long weekend. been going here for years it could be better on the deals"}
{"text":"One thing I love about living in Vegas--- outlet malls that are strategically placed in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city! 

The Charleston outlet is my favorite Outlet to go to because it is new, really clean, modern, nice outdoor mall and pretty much all the stores I would want and I love their food court too. There's something about this place that everytime I go here it makes me feel like I'm on vacation... which is a good thing of course! 

If you are visiting and are choosing between going to the South or the North outlet malls, it's a no brainer.. this one would be the winner!"}
{"text":"Love outlet malls.. this one had a lot of different stores and the prices overall were very good.. spend about 5 hours here and didn't even had time enough to go into every store so a good place to spend a day !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this outlet mall. It is located just North of the Las Vegas Strip. Great parking and a huge area where taxis can drop you off and pick you up at. Some of my favorite stores are coach.. juicy.. Tommy hill... MK of course :) among many others! One summer I got 6 designer purses for under 500.00. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love it here, great stores and even better prices ! There are just so many annoying rude tourists everywhere."}
{"text":"I'm not your typical chicka - I really don't care too much for shopping...yeah, yeah, I know! But, we had a bit of time to kill while in Vegas, so we wandered over to the Outlet shops - they have a pretty amazing variety of shops, and a lot of \"premium\" shops as well (Burberry, Coach, True Religion, etc.). 

The shops are outdoors, so I'm sure this place must REALLY suck in the dead of summer - but since we were there in October, it was perfect - if not a tit nippy!

Amazingly enough, I actually found some stuff that I liked and bought it for next to nothing!"}
{"text":"I like this outlet mall, let me say this. BUT, its even harder to find a parking space here than it is @ the Outlet mall center on LV Blvd.  This store does have way more stores. However, the stores here are much smaller. The reason this place gets an extra star is b/c I dont rememeber getting hassled by the kiosk people. Another reason is b/c I have never been able to go here w/out buying something. There's so much to choose from. 

My fav stores:
Levi's- love their T-shirts and cute dresses, believe it or not.
Coach - self explanitory but again the girls here are so push - you dont need to tell me how much I save and how much it will cost for every single thing I pick up in the store to admire. This makes me not want to buy anything at all. 
The cosmetics co. -one of my favorites. why pay full price @ the mall? you can get lancome here super cheap. I once bought a 1 oz bottle of magnifique for $14.00!  and 8 juicy tube lip glosses for $14.00 and a full size one for $10. liquid lancome make up $20. its so cheap.
Ecko-my bf likes it
Calvin Klein
kenneth cole
Nine West
Sketchers-love the boots
RalpH lauren
Sunglasses Hut



I do have to say - eat before you come b/c its a nightmare in the foodcourt. Often no place to sit. The chinese food place we chose to eat at once was horrible. OMG. I had to throw it all away. I ate maybe 2 bites. One to discover its horror, the 2nd to confirm its sheer nastiness. Like eating a block of lard. The nxt time we went we waited to head over to Fitzgerald for dinner for $6 - ayce pasta and soup and salad bar. Take that Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Had pretty decent stores, but prices were not that amazing to me. parking garage was super crowded and took forever, I wish we would have valeted b/c after walking around the outlets I didnt want to walk back to the car. They had little spray misters like the ones at amusements parks to keep you cool in the blazing heat, but it started raining on us, so those didnt really do us any good. They have an inside food court but I didnt eat there."}
{"text":"This is better than the Premium Outlets - South.  With a better selection of stores and facilities.  Asics running shoes, Ferragamo, Burbery, Kate Spade, etc..."}
{"text":"Next time you think about wanting to stop at Primm on your way to Vegas, don't! Just keep driving..... and when you get to Vegas...... keep driving on I-15 and go to these outlets. It's SO much better than Primm -- by a long shot.

The stores have more merchandise and there are better stores. Plus, an outdoor mall is more appealing to me than an indoor one. They offer valet parking for $5, but there is a parking structure with more than enough parking available so you can opt to do that if you don't want to spend $5."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this mall. It is very tight, not a lot of room for a lot of people to walk by without bumping into each other.  I can only imagine what it's like during the holidays.  And you can find the same stores and lousy parking at any regular mall.  Besides, how many clothing stores does a mall need? And the prices are no better than you find anywhere else. Two types of stores that are missing, IMO: sporting/sports and wine.  I was looking for a wine gift here, but ended up at a convenience store somewhere else.  Also wanted a pro sports jacket, but nothing here. 

Best thing about this mall is its location.

To each his/her own."}
{"text":"This place isn't much better than the Las Vegas Outlet Center, but an easier-to-navigate layout, an open-air environment and a few other factors work in its favor slightly. 

Like the LVOC, this place is pretty much entirely clothing stores, so don't bother coming here if you're looking to shop for anything else. It's a pretty normal selection, and if you go in enough stores you are bound to find some good deals on clothes and the like. 

The food court selection is pretty normal, with some of it being portioned off and indoors. A nice idea that helps you get out of the heat, I must admit. Makino also has a location here. 

Like the LVOC, this place is more crowded than it needs to be due to massive tourist numbers, so if you come during peak hours, expect to be fighting through some serious crowds. 

Once again, this place is for clothing shoppers only, and even then, don't go out of your way to get to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent shopping here. Coach has an outlet here as well as a Men's outlet. I had already made my Coach purchases but it was still fun to look some more. 
Juicy Couture has an outlet here. I found a kickin charm bracelet for a friend of mine on clearance.

If I have only one complaint it is that this is an outdoor mall. In the desert heat that sucks, they try to combat it with a mister system but if its hot its bloody hot.

I would certainly go back here, just in cooler temperatures the next time."}
{"text":"The outlets are cool great place to get away from the strip great process and service is always good! One of reason I like to visit Vegas always nice people and good deals!"}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas I always make sure to hit at many out of the outlets as I can. I'm a bargain shopper and even if you are in the same store as one of the other outlets the selection can be drastically different. This outlet has a great selection of store. Nike is a must and we made countless jokes about the Ed Hardy outlet. Assholes can shop at a discount now. 

Since it's Vegas and it's hot in the summer and cold in the winter be aware that this is an outdoor outlet so plan for the weather and FYI beware of the stench of sewage, ass and hot garbage that can linger around the food court."}
{"text":"Really cool stores and a lot of selections, but why have an outdoor outlet in Vegas? There is some shade, but it's soo hard to walk from store to store when it's 115 outside. The restrooms don't even have AC, so waiting for a stall and using the restrooms were so uncomfortable. Outlets are supposed to be outdoor, but some fansand more shade around would be nice to have."}
{"text":"Ich finde die Mall gro√üartig! F√ºr gew√∂hnlich finde ich nie etwas in Outlets oder zahle am Ende doch zu viel unfein frustriert, aber die hier war zumindest f√ºr mich optimal: Converse, Levis, Fossil - ordentlich gespart, Sonder- oder Auslaufmodelle bekommen, die es so zuhause nicht gibt und das noch zu Schn√§ppchenpreisen. 

Tipp: Vorher kostenlos zum VIP Club online anmelden, dann gibt's an der Info nochmal ein Gutscheinheft - bzw. wenn man per Yelp eincheckt, h√§tte man es auch bekommen.

Wer in Vegas tags√ºber Zeit hat - unbedingt vorbeischauen!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor spot to go shopping. The parking although in a parking structure is cool because it is smart and tells you where there are open spots. Overall, lots of good stores. They have a great Tory Burch store which is expanded from the original one that used to be here. Cheesecake Factory, Nike, Timberland, Saks and Nieman Marcus outlet, Carters and a great motherhood maternity to name a few. Lots and lots of foreigners here. Buses and long taxis lines can been seen dropping off out of town guests to go shopping. A lot of people always buying more luggage which I think is funny. I don't like that they don't have enough bathrooms. The food court has them but If you are shopping you got to walk All the way to the middle of the grounds to go tinkle. Sucks!"}
{"text":"btwn here and the South location, this one is much bigger and its an outdoors outlet mall. There are plenty of stores and have all the main anchor stores such as Nike, etc. Very clean and open. Plenty of area to get dropped off at and there is plenty of public transportation stops as well."}
{"text":"We ended up here because they were closer to our hotel than its southern sister.

The traffic heading into the outlets was pretty bad, and being in a taxi, all I could do was stare at the meter and the long line of cars ahead of us.  On the plus side, we didn't have to hunt for a parking stall.

ATMOSPHERE:
The open-air design is pretty big compared to other outlets I've been to.  The design is really easy to navigate through and is laid out well.  It's very crowded and naturally very touristy.

TENANTS:
They have all the usual selections including my favorites Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, and Hugo Boss.  The food court is weak, like at most outlets, but they've recently added a Cheesecake Factory restaurant.

When it was time to leave the outlets, the taxi line was super long!  Can you say Uber?"}
{"text":"We went to the house some Wilson and got the best deals on their leather I'll kinds of good stuff love it"}
{"text":"If you enjoy sales you need to come to this outlet. It has plenty of stores. I enjoyed shopping so much did it two days in a row. I didn't like the selection of restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet, a beautiful day, no long lines, great stores with super bargains. What could go wrong? Annoyed to the point of just leaving?  Let em tell you. 

In one of the intersections in the back there is a cluster of kiosks. You've seen them, hair iron, luggage, etc. well there these obnoxious guys selling some dark box or something like that calling out to people. Ugh

For me he starts speaking some gibberish sounding Asian something. Not cool. 

I just left, not done shopping but will go elsewhere. How the management allows these clowns, I don't know. To management: think I'm exaggerating?  Go watch for five minutes.  

I get they are there to sell something but to be addressing people who don't wish to be addressed is wrong. This is an upscale center, isn't it?"}
{"text":"sorry this place sucks. most of the prices here are the same as retail. not a lot of stores for guys unless you like atheltic wear. Outlet malls used to be very cool and nice and you used to be able to get good deals. now the best you can do is get $5 off or some 2 for 1 deal that basically saves you $5-$10. not worth the hassle of parking and walking around in the hot sun all day. just not that great of an experience or stores."}
{"text":"Five dollars to park at a mall. You can go F yourself outlets. We used to visit every time in town but no longer. I hope all the stores see a significant drop in sales as a result. A few store managers losing their jobs and having their kids go hungry MIGHT convince them to reverse this asinine money grab."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Outlets in the USA next to only the Seattle premium outlets. The parking garage is shit show on the weekend so stay away on the weekend! This place is like a United Nations so, great people watching just don't get frustrated if they are in front of you in line."}
{"text":"I remember when this location was puny compared to the South location.  Now, the stores and the parking and even the restaurants are expanding on this side in ways that the South location couldn't ever manage.  Far more outlets here than in the South location or even Primm.  Prices are good but not always exceptional.  Parking is AWFUL (completely full, with people sitting in their cars waiting for spaces to open) on weekend peak times but fine on most week days.  This is the only outlet mall in the Vegas area that has a Mastercard discount deal.  If you use Mastercard, be sure to stop at the management office for the brochure that doubles as a discount pass."}
{"text":"Great stores, decent prices, horrible parking, and a shitty food selection.

I guess you've got an over abundance of food selection everywhere else on the strip, so why bother when it comes to an outlet mall.

Don't bother parking outside the parking structure, unless you get there before 10 am.  You're better off tailing someone leaving the mall and taking their spot, just like in college.  

They have a last call store for BCBG, so you're looking at better than outlet prices, if you're lucky to find something.  You have to rummage  through the racks like a madwoman, but you might just find a top for $9.  We had to peel my friend from this store, and even then, she didn't spend more than $100."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and never really bought anything because outlet prices are ridiculous.  However, a few of my friends scored some good deals at Tory Burch and Dolce & Gabanna (if by a deal you mean a $200 purse or a $250 pair of dress shoes). The only stores that I go into are Jcrew and Diesel as I am not a Coach kind of girl and Burberry is not up my alley."}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop by each trip!  I love all the stores, and even the food options at this outlet.  Whenever I stop by I have to always get myself Amorino Gelato!

I always find great deals at the Nike store here compared to the ones in California.  This is better than the outlets located on the South side of the strip, trust me!!"}
{"text":"Since I live so far away, I don't usually find myself at these outlets unless something else brings me in the area.  This particular visit came from an all company meeting for my employer at the Smith Center.  We had a couple of hours to kill, so we ended up coming to the outlets to shop and grad a bite. 

I really appreciate the entire experience at the premium outlets.  This place is packed with hospitality, shops and people!  When you walk through the front, the information booth never skips a beat to say hello.  It was a super hot day, but no worrries!  This place was packed with misters.  

This place is packed with different shops and dining options, so if you're ever in the area, come by and check it out!"}
{"text":"This mall is a cluster fuck. It is always packed with Asians (my people) and tourists who are so rude and shove you out of the way lmao. Think of girls lining up at 6am for a exclusive handbag but all day fighting over piles and crazy lines. Besides their awesome prices, I will probably refrain from coming here unless my Chinese parents are in town wanting Tory burch HAHAHAH.

Ps their parking here has been a clusterfuck for 3 years hahaha. GET IT TOGETHER! I waited literally 25 min to park in the garage.."}
{"text":"It's hard to swallow walking around in heat or generous gusts of wind which seems to happen on the few times I come here. 

I am the dope that rarely has found the crazy deals that people are talking about, but the brands and general discounts are decent enough to take a gander every now and then. I'm not into the usual top brands like Coach,Ed Hardy and Juicy that people seem to flock here for but some of the more less monogrammed stores are also represented so there is stuff for me. 

It's alright of a place, I don't go too often, but I suppose I'm a fan specially since it saved my butt on a gift for my mom....you can never go wrong with BCBG on that lady."}
{"text":"Visited here during our Dec 2017 trip to Vegas.  Took Lyft; there's a designated drop off area.

Mall was clean and set up fairly efficiently.  However, it was a nice day when we visited; I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much during a hot summer day (or rare rainy one)."}
{"text":"This outlet has stores I love. The only thing this place needs is more places to sit and they NEED a family restroom where you can breastfeed a baby and change a diaper."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for Thanksgiving and took the SDX to the Premium Outlets on Thanksgiving to do some shopping.  It seems lots of others had the same idea as the bus was pretty full.  When we arrived at the outlet in the morning, I was glad it wasn't crazy busy.  After getting off the bus we headed in and then turned right.  The first store we went to was Under Armour and we spent a lot of time there shopping for shoes and clothes for ourselves and others.  They had a great sale and the line up to pay wasn't too long which was great.  Next we headed into The North Face and it was busier to shop and pay, but glad for no line ups outside of the store.  Walking around the outlet, there was ample seating available and ability to walk around at a reasonable pace.

Although a handful of stores were closed and Kate Spade and Michael Kors had line ups that we didn't bother joining, we checked out a number of stores that had great deals.  It's too bad we had our hands full with bags, as we could have continued to browse and buy as there were some great deals (even with the exchange rate!).  The longest line I experienced that day was for the washroom! 

I checked the directory and map before we left so had a good idea what stores I wanted to go to and where they were located.  I've been to the outlet a few times on previous visits and have always walked away happy with my purchases.  It was also very easy to get back to our hotel with our bags as it's the first stop on the SDX heading back on the strip so we were able to get seats and it wasn't standing room only. I'm glad we didn't come on Black Friday as we were told the sales would be the same as Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"This is the Las Vegas South Premium's northern sister property. It's definitely more outdoorsy being open air. They pretty much have the same amount of stores and same brands Las LV South premium. This outlet is nice to visit in when it's spring time and it's not too hot. During the winter it's nice as well. They have people sing Christmas Carols, but be warned, Christmas shoppers are EVERYWHERE. However, if you're new to Vegas or want cheap clothes I recommend you visit and get some shopping done!"}
{"text":"If its winter, bring a coat. If its summer, use flip-flops and tanks. I get lost here, but its a \"good\" lost ya know?!"}
{"text":"For someone who hates shopping (except on the internet), gotta say I was pretty impressed.  Some of the stores had incredible deals and some gave me further deals because it was my birthday--thank you Kenneth Cole! (pays to wear that \"Kiss me Its My Birthday\" button!).  I got some great stuff."}
{"text":"Outlet malls are a scam now. In the 1990's they were actual places to shop for great deals. These malls today are complete marketing scams. No deals, just a lot of overpriced merchandise. Don't get me started on the aggressive kiosk merchants that are lined throughout this outlet mall pushing their junk products."}
{"text":"Premium Outlet North is the outdoor mall. I prefer this over the South because it's much bigger. However, the day that we went, it was storming. We got soaked. We only had about an hour to walk around before the mall closed. I'm sure I would have bought more things if I had more time to look around. We spent most of the hour in Adidas. They were running a great promo. It was buy one and get the second item half off. Plus if you spend $100, you get $25 off. I ended up paying around $80 for three pairs of shoes and six pairs of socks. I'm a shopper and know a good deal when I see one.

Nike, Guess, Sketchers, Hurley, Tommy Hilfiger, and L'Occitane were some of the stores that I'd seen. They also have a food court in its own little building. They had about seven eateries in that place. 

Around the corner from Adidas is the customer service location. If you check in with your Yelp app you get a free coupon book priced at $10. The guy working behind the counter had never seen the app before and said I was the first. He gave me the coupon book anyway. Funny, the same thing happened at the South outlet."}
{"text":"Always a nice place to soak up sun and shop away from the strip. I think all the foreign tourists think the same way. Don't be shocked when you see people rolling around their largest suitcases stuffed full of their finds. The entries/tour bus meeting points are constantly buzzing with people comparing buys and re-packing their suitcases in their foreign tongue. It is very entertaining and makes me not only hopeful when entering but so disappointed when leaving. 

I never know where to start but do know that I usually have a moment of panic when walking by the Coach store to see hundreds of ladies going crazy for the big 'C'. I am always curious to see what I may find but only make it to the first table maybe the second then turn and run out. Then I try the shoe stores that never quite work out but I have yet to give up on em. I tend to stay away from stores I have in my area but I had a few gift cards to burn and found some steals at Banana Republic.

I try to avoid Armani Exchange cause they like to blow your ear drum with the unsk-unsky music that makes you waste hours in there checking out insanely vibrant clothes that are priced so low you have to look through EVERYTHING while tapping along with the beat. Found a lot I would have purchased but couldn't quite handle the chaos. I am a bad woman I know. My girlfriend found a great dress for cheap as did her sister. I think it was that store that made me wish there were good outlets by me. I could see it being a pit stop for a girl in need of hottness.

Moving along we skipped the Puma store and a few other shops to be on our way. We were able to hit Lacoste and I always look forward to Lacoste as it NEVER has anything for me :) The boys like going there for the cheap polos but I never find anything for myself. I was just doing a quick walk through when I ran across a one day only Easter sale rack. It had a ton of tennis skirts, t-shirts, and sweats- FOR $20! I confirmed the price of the goods I wanted, tried them on and walked out with a sweater and tennis skirt for $40 and some change! It was a one day sale and saves my self over $200. Crazy.

Food court is decent. Great place to start the day and firm up the plan of attack with your shopping posse. Across from it is what I think is called the Fudgery and they were so charming helping me stay within my dietary needs after a day of shopping.

Overall a great place to kill some time and still get a brand name bag or two without wasting the winnings from the night before."}
{"text":"The first few times I drove to this outlet mall, I wasn't a huge fan.  There are some definite downsides.  The parking can be atrocious, and some of the stores feel a bit like flea markets... smelly people digging through piles of undesirable waste.  Can you tell I'm not really a fan of outlet malls?  I have been elbowed in the temple on each and every trip I've made to an outlet mall, so maybe my brain is addled.  But I digress.

I am giving this outlet mall 3 stars because I have occasionally scored a good deal or two at this location (helloooooo Kate Spade wicker basket purse!).  However, much like other outlet malls, this one has its fair share of bad deals as well.  Maybe I have a rampant shopping problem, but I generally know how much things go for at \"regular\" stores... and sometimes, there isn't a price difference at all.  I prefer to visit this mall at night.  It seems like there are fewer suburban housewives with excessively large strollers.  

Overall, I will probably visit once or twice more before I move back home to Missouri in July.  It's about as good an outlet mall as I have visited."}
{"text":"I decided to come with the husband after all the raving reviews. 

Parking structure: horrible despite of the notification of any open slots. I drove past a lot of spaces which were green but occupied. There are many spots they could have utilized for parking but marked slanted no parking lines instead. Waste of space and poorly designed. I am sure we spent at least 20-3mins for parking. 

Drivers: they drive like bats out of hell around the corners and are prone to either running into a pedestrian or another vehicle. 

After we finally got a spot...

We headed towards the outlet mall. This place has virtually NO SHADE! Yes, I know vegas has crazy weathered but come on, the designers should have thought to put more shade and rest areas in the 110+ degree weather. 

Bathrooms: Big ass outlet center with only a few bathrooms. We had to walk past two whole blocks of stores prior to finding a spot to pee. Geeze Louis!

Water spritzer: poorly designed and by the time the water is spritzed out, it has already evaporated in the heat. What a waste of water. 

Stores: \"pose\" to have an insane sale but in the end it's just false advertisement. 

We made it around the outlet but did not end up buying anything since there were virtually no deals. 

This place is over-hyped on yelp and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for actual deals. I'd rather go to premium outlet south location (indoor)."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy shopping but when it's needed this location works for me.  it's close to the strip and has a good variety of shops for everyone in your group.  The layout is good because you can mindlessly wander and not get lost because most shops are in rows. 

The parking accommodations are not that great.  I have more luck finding a parking space in the outdoor lot on the north end of the complex especially when it's 108 in the shade (no one wants to walk in that heat let alone park their car in direct sunlight)."}
{"text":"This is a large outlet with a lot of my favorite stores. Actually, each member of my party was able to get the items of their choice. We were all excited to see the Pandora store. Don't forget your check in to get a discount book. We did not use the books as you needed to spend more money per store than we were spending. It was not too crowded on a Friday morning while waiting for hotel check in time."}
{"text":"Nice set up. I didn't see anything I could live without though. All the stores are the same you would see at any other outlet shopping center."}
{"text":"I've to lots of outlets this by far has rude security guards .....not allowed to wait in car for my spouse to get off work .....So moved to a more convenient spot but apparently a no go.....any other outlet is cool with me waiting in the car with my kids.....other than the outlet has lots of good stores walk around looking for you need the only other bad thing is that's its a out door mall so be ready for the heat"}
{"text":"This place is close to home. It's difficult to find parking, even on weekdays. It's outdoors, which is crazy hot in the summer. I really dread being there every minute during the summer but I love it so much in the winter.

I always like their food stands: dole whip, Churros, soft pretzels, and more.

I love their Nike outlet here, which tons of deals there. I bought a great our of Asics shoes for under $50 here, including tax, when everywhere else they are $80+. I've got to say my favorite store here is Rue 21. Their discount racks have the cutest clothes. I bought a for soft pretzel at Auntie Anne's for $4 that can be used in this mall. I have yet to look through the entire mall by it's one if my favorite malls to shop at so far."}
{"text":"despite the mall being outside, it is amazing...all the stores you like + discounted prices...Nike Store was my favortie"}
{"text":"Outlet shopping is definitely up there on the top reasons to go to Vegas and this outlet certainly doesn't disappoint!! I've been going to Vegas for years and years and was super excited when this new outlet came about and even more excited when they expanded!  They've got a variety of stores from the classic Coach outlet to Banana, French Connection, Children's Place, Guess, etc to LeSport Sac, Juicy, and D&B.  The fact that it's outdoors is good and bad, sometimes weather makes it a little difficult to shop (too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter).  I love the addition of the parking structure, though I think it seems like a far walk from the structure to the stores - but I'm all for more parking! Another great thing about the place is that on Black Friday, it seems that they keep opening earlier and earlier for serious shopper like myself!!

I do think that they need to improve on their Food Court - there really isn't anything about it that stands out, but at least they have a Starbucks!!"}
{"text":"This is an outdoor outlet mall close to the downtown area. An uber to this mall from an down town hotel is approx $5-$7. This outlet mall is pretty big with store like Nike, Nautica,sketchers, Dkny, Disney, Calvin Klein, Children's place, Oshiro Kosh, Toys R Us,Tommy Guess. They are open Monday thru Saturday 9-9 and Sundays 9-8. We enjoyed shopping at this mall but didn't get to the whole outlet mall. It's quite big and it was kinda of a cold night. We will go back maybe during the day! Happy Shopping!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to shop in Vegas.  

They have lots of variety here, including some higher end outlets like Coach, Coach Mens, Burberry, Kate Spade etc!  Many kid's stores like Carters, Childrens Place, Gap Kids, OGBG, etc.....And lots of sports stores, like Nike, Addidas, Reebok, and Puma too, so essentially everything you are looking for will be here!

Really wish they had somewhere for kids to play though.  And better restaurants LOL...now I am getting picky.

Only bad thing is that it is outside...so when it is cold/hot, rainy/windy etc, it slows you down, but still a great place to shop!"}
{"text":"My wife is looking for presents for friends/family birthdays. I am following her around. Shopping ain't my thing but this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"***Pro tip, visit the information center to buy the coupon book. It will save you a lot of $$$ if you're in the mood to shop.

Love the variety of stores here and outlet discounts !"}
{"text":"1. Great selection of brands/stores
2. Tiny food court. Eat elsewhere. 
3. Long line and slow service for Starbucks in the summer
4. Ample parking

My favorite outlet store is Banana Republic because you can find good quality clothes for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We shop here every time we are in town. We filled up the whole car!  It get busy here so parking is challenging but worth the hassle. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love shopping, but I love outlet shopping more! 

This place has a lot of good places - Kenneth Cole, Guess, Ann Taylor, Coach, Bebe, Nike and others. 

If you like Guess - you have to hit up this one because they have some great deals.  My friends got jeans for $15 and the tops are cute.

I loved the French Connection - a lot of the stuff was an additional 30-50%.

Beware of the Coach outlet, they are great deals but it's full of other women wanting that Coach purse for 30-50% off the retail price.  

I do like this outlet though. A lot of the name brand stores do have good deals. it's outdoors so it's nice to walk around and enjoy the day.  But if it's REALLY hot, which it can be in Vegas then maybe you won't enjoy the day. Anyway, if you don't want to blow your money at a casino gambling or eating at a buffet, go shopping here and buy something nice for yourself."}
{"text":"Prefer this to the south outlets here in LV. Slightly strange layout but overall good shops. Higher end to the south outlets. Taxi right outside."}
{"text":"We went to Las Vegas Premium Outlets to eat at Makino's, and so I'm quite torn on how to review this mall.  I originally wanted to give it a one star because of their unorganized parking.  From when we exited the I-15 Freeway to parking in their garage took a whole thirty-five minutes.  Needless to say, I was not happy to be there.

Our trip to this mall was on a Saturday afternoon.  I figured it would just be like taking a trip to Town Square, as easy as eating pie.  But, I was wrong and didn't work out that way.

The reason for the three stars is because the stores are good to visit and the employees seem really nice.  Everything is inexpensive and there are always deals going on.  Deals are always good to have especially with me.  :)

I will probably have a better time if I went there when it wasn't a weekend."}
{"text":"I like this outlet. First, it is quite near the city, just a few minutes' drive. Second, it s quite concentrated, making the stroll quite easier. Third, it is more focused on American stuff. Also, the service is quite nice, and shop assistants are really helpful. I love the place."}
{"text":"First time to visit this outlet store in Vegas and i must say they have the best selection of nike merchandise. I found my favorite running shoes here."}
{"text":"Las Vegas!

I never knew there was an outlet here.
Perhaps, all my attention was indeed in dining and enjoying nightlife :p

Anyway, I was here on Christmas eve and Christmas day during the day. I didnt have that much time to shop on eve, so I basically just browsed around for an half hour or so and left. There were a couple stores that I wanted to go in but the line was way too long (Tory Burch, Michael Kors, and Ferragarmo).

I came back the next day on Christmas day, and things were even worse. Most of the stores were closed. Bummers. I kind of figured that some stores could be closed but why does it have to be all my favorite stores? Sucks, but this is totally my fault.

This outlet has many great designer shops to other more less expensive and easy-to-be-seen stores like Aldo, Quiksilver, Gap, and Nike factory outlet. 

Enough parking to accmodate all the visitors and shoppers in the parking structure and outside parking. Also have a few places to eat and many carts that sell 'snacks' as well."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Vegas, I usually make it a point to just do most of my shopping here. It's a good way to kill a couple of hours.

They have the usual brands, including my faves Gap, Banana Republic and J.Crew. They also have a couple of Starbucks stalls and a food court.

The place is huge though...pick up a map at guest services and plot your course carefully....or just pull up the map on your cell phone like I do.

I typically end up buying way more than I anticipated and Priority Mailing it all home - which sometimes is cheaper than checking a bag."}
{"text":"I love this outlet out of all the outlets I've been too. Well,  mainly because the Kate Spade store here is quite big.   I like the fact they also have LeSportSac here as well.  It's hard to find their outlet store in the US.  I know there's another one in Seattle.  The parking lot here is pretty cool.  It will tell you how many spaces are open and will light up to tell you there's a space, just like the mall in Santa Monica.  And parking is free!   The mall is clean overall, and they have plenty of seats in the food court.   I will make sure to make this a tradition to come here every time i come to Vegas. I see a lot of Chinese tourist here with their empty suitcases to collect all their goodies.  Pretty cute to see this."}
{"text":"Having shopped here multiple times a year, spending plenty of $$ each time we come to Las Vegas, I was shocked to see this place has gone the same route as the corporate whore casinos on the strip - they now charge $5.00 to park in their already completed parking structure. Last visit ever."}
{"text":"I am a much bigger fan of the North outlets rather than South.  They just have more stores that I shop at. 

I like to check the website for sales (ie. 40% off clearance) as that usually determines when I will make the trip out here. 

Banana and Gap will offer sometimes offer a 15% discount on a future purchase if you complete a survey after your transaction. 

Now let's discuss PARKING. I don't know what was going on, but last Saturday parking was ABSOLUTELY insane.  Worst time I've had parking there.  I went around 2pm and the outside lot was full, the parking lot on Alta was full so I ended up trailing these cars into the other parking lot which took FOREVER.  We were just crawling up each floor of the parking lot looking for spaces and even the people leaving the parking lot were jammed up as well.  Looked like it would have taken like 30 mins to get out of the lot!  Luckily I found a space, after contemplating turning around.  My advice is to go EARLY if you're going on a weekend or later on in the afternoon. The traffic totally cleared up when I left around 5pm."}
{"text":"I love this place. I spent more money than I wanted to, but when it's 110 degrees outside and you have a choice of going inside a nice air conditioned store or melting outside, shopping too much is inevitable."}
{"text":"This outlet mall is pretty cool. I love that they have both Michael Kors and Coach, and other favorites such as Guess and Juicy.

It's pretty big so it's hard to get through all of it unless you know what you're looking for. 

My bf and I found some pretty good deals last weekend but unfortunately the heat was too much to bear. Most stores have air conditioning though which helps.

Overall, I recommend!"}
{"text":"As I write this tears are streaming down my internal fashionista's face. FCUK! The French Connection outlet store is no more. It has been replaced with a sad Rue 21. I am this close to downgrading to three stars, but the outdoor exercise element and my latest sweet finds at the Diesel and Vans stores is saving this Premium place for the time being. And, J. Crew did a nice job for me too. On a somewhat related note: The Polo store makes me a little crazy."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday around 1:00 after some brunch at Baby Cakes Cafe :)

Parking is normally an issue, but I lucked out and found a spot quickly. From what I saw, the recommended technique to finding a spot is to drop off the kids and wife and then drive through the parking garage. 

Outlet malls may have good stores, but they usually stock old items. I didn't find that to be the case here. These outlets were quality stores with quality merchandise and low prices. 

Now that I am familiar with the layout, I'll come again."}
{"text":"If you catch it on a gnarly holiday they hav a lot of sale here. My personal fave here? Tumi! Yes I am so down with a lot of stores here. Who cares if it's an outlet. Reaaallly good stuff tho'. So if you are needing for a new gear and kicks. ( clothes and shoes) this is your go place. Unless, you have a lot of dough to spend then this is not for you . ( go Caesars forum ) . Hey just a reminder its not all that cheap here, it's far fetch from your regular Marshall's and TJ Maxx or Ross. A wallet maybe 150 depending on where you go. Purse 250 or 300 up to 2000 ( cant afford the 20000 ) :) depends. But no super low ballers :) ... happy shopping... :)"}
{"text":"HUGE HUGE HUGE. this place has almost everything!!!  Even great places to way in the food court. Misters going in the summer so that makes the outside shopping more bearable. I sober too much money but can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"I have always found this to by my favorite shopping for someone who hates shopping. They have a lot of very high end clothing stores for half the price. And my favorite shop DIESEL which I can't get enough of. You can look forward to spending at least 2 hours here walking around. And add an hour if you go with someone who loves to shop. : /"}
{"text":"I always find something good here.  I can't stand the Premium Outlets near Palm Springs or the Camarillo spot.  Way overcrowded and stupid lines everywhere.  I'll save my shopping trips for this outlet."}
{"text":"Other than walking the strip, hiking Red Rock, or just gambling....this is our preferred 'walk-off-buffet' spot after lunch.  Nothing strenuous, just using foot and eye coordination.  Walking from one outlet store to another, we try to gain some appetite for dinner or late night treat.  

They have a nice assortment of outlet stores, from Adidas to Banana Republic to Timberland.  Surroundings are clean and well kept, and parking is plentiful.  If there's one thing to complain about, it would be the food court.  For the size of this outdoor mall, I expected to see a much larger food court and more snack options for people on the go.

Nonetheless, I usually feel like a winner here more than any casino I've been to.  

Outlet prices + Clearance items = Jackpot"}
{"text":"The last Vegas North Premium Outlets have most of the brands I like. Coming here during a non-peak season is easy. There is ample space to park. It is also I good outdoor outlet. Stores are organized and not all over the place. If you want to get some cardio into your day and do some shopping? Come to this place. During peak-season such as Thanksgiving day and Black Friday, be prepared to test your patience and endurance. This place gets packed like a sardine and customers starts to get agitated due to the long wait for parking, traffic, waiting to get inside the stores, or just plainly impatient and rude. Aside from that, this is a good place for shopping whenever you are in Las Vegas, either off-season or peak season."}
{"text":"If you're going outlet shopping while in Vegas this is the one to go to. Skip the one in the South.  Its not as nice and dint have as many nice brands you're looking for.

Yes, its pretty hot here as its an outdoor mall but they have all the misters and fans going which make it a little more bare able.  Parking can be a bit challenging on a busy day but we came on a Thursday and it wasn't too bad.  There's also plenty of your typical mall food stops here for a snack or beverage."}
{"text":"Great stores, great selection! Problem is... parking is a little bit of a pain and it seems no matter where you park you're doomed to reach the outlet center already hot and sweaty... 

Although this place has all the great name brands, it's hard to give a place 5 stars that involves walking around in 110 degree Vegas heat for a long time.. you'll definitely leave thirsty and tired during the summer!"}
{"text":"In hopes of finishing up my XMAS shopping... friend and I went here on a weekend (suicidal, yes... desperate... another yes.)

I failed miserably on finishing my XMAS list... I ended up buying ALL of my XMAS gifts to myself! 

- Benetton rocked... got a $125 suit (jacket and pants) - nice!

- Columbia (I'm in love with them!) killed me! I got another soft shell jacket as well as a track jacket ... (I'm a jacket whore!) ... I literally had to pull myself out of there before I do any more damage to my wallet!

- Adidas - got the clima-something pants for when I need to work out during the winter season plus a beanie... 

Oh I did get a couple of shirts for the nephew at Gymboree... so I at least got something... besides myself =P

Anyway... friendly folks in all the stores... well at least to the stores that I went too...

Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Always the outlet to go to when in Vegas. Don't waste your time at the South, just come straight North.

Got great deals on Puma (40-70% off), Michael Kors, Marciano, and the list goes on! Spent a solid $600 here. lol"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's indoors, your shopping comfortably in AC and the variety of stores is big. The discounts are great. They have 2 food courts and great places to eat outside the mall."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, between Boss, Etro, Ted Baker, and Burberry I'd be flat broke if I lived anywhere near here.  The ability to get there on comfortable and clean busses....enough said."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite outlet center in the country.  They have a good variety of high and lower end stores to suit anyone's preference.  And no matter what you're looking for, they will most likely have it. From clothing to shoes to bags, you really can't go wrong here.  I come here on every Vegas trip.  It's a little pricy getting there from the strip if you cab it.  There are free shuttles from the Grand Chateau for hotel guests that run every hour.  Other hotels may have similar services so it's something to look into if you're visiting and don't have a car."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to visit if you want to get off the strip.  They have plenty of parking in the garage so your car won't roast in the sun all day. The stores are all outside and the layout is a bit confusing. You really need to follow the maps. And being outside, it can get toasty. So plan accordingly. Decent deals, but nothing earth shattering.  Overall, a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Der Outlet ist sehr sauber und Ordentlich!
Man bekommt von echt jeder marken etwas.
Wenn man in Ruhe durchgeht findet man auch sehr gute Schn√§ppchen!"}
{"text":"Winners win big and shop at the Las Vegas Premium Outlet to get what they deserve. But losers, well, all they can do is window-shop. 

\"I'm neither; so don't ask too much from me.\"

This is a very lively and well-architect outlet, especially in the dark evening. There are many stores that fit my rugged and suave lifestyle. Some of the discounted stores I've visited are Nike Factory Outlet (of course), Adidas, Puma, Timberland, Ecco, Mark Ecko, Gap/Banana Republic, Bose, Tag heuer, Ferragamo and L'Occitane. 

The food court is small with a Subway, China Pantry The Great Steak and Potato Co, Dairy Queen, Italia Express and of course a Starbucks all located inside a separate dome with a club-like atmosphere with current dance hits. 

In a separate location, there is also a Makino Seafood and Sushi Buffet restaurant.

In case many of you are concerned about my endurance and fatigueness, I was able to walk the entire bright-light outlet mall."}
{"text":"All my favorite stores in an outlet!

There's a Kate Spade outlet store? Why yes. What about a Tory Burch? Oh, hell yes! So, I had a great time and probably spent too much, but hey we're in Vegas!

The bathrooms were clean and it was easy to get a taxi back to our hotel. The only bummer was that there were no great sales for President's Day weekend. The weather was also wonderful so it was nice to be shopping outdoors!

Also, the outlet was only a few miles away from the strip so very easily accessible!"}
{"text":"Better than the Premium Outlets South by far!
They have some great high end stores as well as your average outlet stores.
The set up is nice, its not too big.
Free parking garage which was full as hell (we're talking an hour to park!) on a saturday afternoon.
Sunday  morning was perfect though, empty and painless.
Its very clean and well kept with something for everyone.
Its a must stop for anyone wanting to do some shopping in Vegas without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"A little confusing  to get to from the I-15. You're better off driving north on Las Vegas Blvd and following the street signs. Parking is pretty ample and The outlet has a variety of shops that caters to the high-end shopper & pinching your pennies shopper. A definite shopping center to visit while visiting Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is one of the best outlets I have ever been to.  They have all nice brands and it it not too far from the strip.  You should sign up for a free VIP membership to get extra online coupons and a coupon books from the information booth.  I prefer this one to the one in the South.  I will go back next time I am in town."}

{"text":"The outlets in the Bay Area are nowhere as nice as the ones in Las Vegas. That being said, a trip to Vegas calls for a trip (or two) to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets and I was so glad I went on a weekday! Some of my favorite stores are Nike, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Cosmetics Company Outlet etc. If you like Coach, Burberry, Michael Kors, Polo Ralph Lauren then you will definitely be impressed with the selection of stores. Everyone warned us that the North outlets was in a shady side of town, but it wasn't that bad during the day!"}
{"text":"We love coming here when we're in Vegas.   The 150 stores are amazing.  We got some great deals at Spyder, Adidas, Ecco, Burberry, etc.  Okay, almost at every store.  You can save lots of money from the malls and stores on the Vegas strip.  It's worth the trip out here.  

You can take a taxi for about $20.00.  I usually rent a car during our visit so I can come back a few times during my stay."}
{"text":"These outlets are awesome. I'm not into shopping: I like going into a store having an idea of what I want and buying something if it meets that idea. These stores let me do that. There is always at least one thing I want to buy every time I go to the outlets. Last year's Labor Day was crazy; I found great deals on Calvin Klein casual button ups and Rusty and Quicksilver shorts.

The selection of stores is great, from Oliver Peoples to Nike, Polo, Kenneth Cole, Zumiez, Adidas, American Apparel, Quicksilver, Volcom, etc.

Most of the time I find parking in the outside lot; only once did I have to rely on the structure, and did not have trouble finding a spot."}
{"text":"I like this outlet, but was disappointed to see that they are now charging $5 for parking. Just another way to rip off the tourist especially knowing there is no other parking options in the area. I maybe rethinking if I wanna shop here in the future."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm a guy, and I admit, I kinda like to shop around! I think the Outlet Malls in Vegas give you another option to gambling, remember what I said in an earlier review... This Outlet, near downtown is easily accessible by bus, car or cab. Lot's of parking and stores to see. Actually got a good deal on some walking shorts here as well as some stuff for the niece and nephew! Good food court and there's lot's of places to sit and rest. But I think if you go early in the day or late in the afternoon it may be better since it can get pretty hot!"}
{"text":"Always great deals. Sizes run pretty small in general. I I my like to buy on clearance and there are always great finds"}
{"text":"If I had to choose between the Las Vegas north outlet versus the south outlet, I would choose the north hands down. However a big difference is the north is outdoor while the south is mainly indoor so in the summer time i would recommend the south one.

The north has more variety of stores and more higher class store names compared to the south. Also they have covered parking garage and I believe the north is bigger. I'm not 100% sure but from my experience with both I just felt like I walked more on the north side.

It's also right by the highway but there is construction so it is pretty hectic right now but if you are a tourist then I would just uber or lyft your way from the strip. It's like 5$ and it's worth the lack of stress in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really like these outlets!  They have a lot of high end stores that I've never seen in other outlet malls, but they also have some of the typical outlet players.  It's pretty easy to navigate - there are a ton of maps with the stores listed in alphabetical order.  In the summer there are misters that make it more bearable to walk around outdoors.  

I take off a star because I think the parking garage is one of the more frustrating to park in.  In my experience there's always a long line of cars waiting to park and it takes forever.  Other than that, a great place to shop with good variety."}
{"text":"Its alright. I prefer the Premium Outlets South because its enclosed. The Food court is better and the stores are geared more for locals and not tourists. Plus I stopped in at Auntie Anne's pretzels with my little one, and the employees were rude. Like they didnt want to deal with the line and the tourists. HELLO You work at the PREMIUM OUTLETS. Tourist Central. QUIT YOUR JOB IF YOU DONT LIKE IT. Yes i was rude to her right back."}
{"text":"I love this place hey have Kate spade and all the other stores I like.  I come here when we don't stop at primm, because it is the only other Kate spade.

The parking when it is busy is Better to park across the street instead of trying to go in the structure. 

The place is hot during the hot summer months and very unbearable."}
{"text":"The Good:
decent shops for guys - burberry, boss, quicksilver, AX. a lot of outlets only have the one or two stores you'd go in so its really not worth the trip out.

opens later...shops close i think either 8 or 9 pm so normal mall hours.

decent selection..so its not all the junk u dont want to buy from a normal store.


The Bad:
prices are much higher nowadays...its not that much of a difference to go into the regular stores...well, still much cheaper than the Caesar Forum Shops but!!! 

far away from the strip, so if u didnt drive to vegas, its not worth cabbing it there...but the good thing is that there are a lot of cabs waiting outside of the outlets if a ride is needed back to the hotel.."}
{"text":"Great Premium outlet. Always good deals in a lot of shops. Usually always enough parking spots available, though on weekends or days when there are special events or expos in Vegas it can get a bit tricky to find a spot."}
{"text":"This place has become part of a Tuesday ritual with my friend. Nothing is better than getting dim sum and walking around the outlets to burn off all the delicious Chinese goodness you consumed. Although I have been unfaithful and visited many other shopping malls on my weekly excursions, this will always hold a special place in my heart. I know it is redundant to repeat how much of a deals hound I am, but who does not love a good sale?

Banana Republic always has some great sales going. In February, they had a suit sale. What normally would have been $350, sold for $135. I bought two fitted suits for almost the same price as one. 

When I need workout close, Adidas is the place to go. Watch out for red ticket items. Every now and then they do specials where they take an extra 50% off of drastically reduced inventory. 

There are so many stores, that targets a vast range of consumers, you are bound to come out with some amazing finds. Even if you don't, it is good exercise. Just avoid during the summer, the crowds are massive, the heat is killer, and the shear amount of people only makes the Las Vegas sun more unbearable."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I ask myself why!?
The Columbia outlet store is the only reason I head here, there isn't another in town. I like the Columbia outlet store but I seriously hate these outlets as a whole. Getting in and out is never easy. Even when it's not a holiday or weekend, parking is a nightmare. Always crowded, full of rude people. There's no airflow if you go on warmer days, it gets stuffy in those walkways. They're currently doing some sort of construction outside of the parking garage making things an even bigger cluster f***. I'll read this review every time I think I want to go to this outlet."}
{"text":"This mall was appropriately sized, but for me, stores in it were not as interesting as some premium malls have in LA. You can get there by taking public transit or Uber, but I suggest use personal vehicle since the mall has ample space for parking.
Overall, nothing was super interesting, but also nothing to complain too much about. Maybe I was expecting too much.
Easy 3.5 to 4 stars tho."}
{"text":"I am in it for all of this! Beautiful day calls for some nice outdoor shopping! Loving it!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS find something good here. Even when I pep talk myself in the car before I walk in that I don't need anything and I can't be spending my whole paycheck like last time. Yet as always, I come out of there a few bags heavier and a whole wallet lighter. 

My favorite spots are Levi's, Pacsun, Nike, and I've heard great things about Kate Spare, Nine West, Adidas, and Lululemons, but ya know my wallet can only take me so far."}
{"text":"First time going to any of the outlets in vegas and WOW, pretty impressive.  idk if it's just me but they have MUCH better stuff here than the outlets in CA.  Wish we could have stayed longer, but next time I think I'll have to squeeze this into our schedule.  Parking wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Weather is nice for outdoor shopping, a nice leisurely stroll after some sushi, stores like Coach, Burberry, LaSporte, Levi, etc...not really crowded tonight. Most offering some deals. 

I am not a shopper, but I like seeing what's out there, and who's offering what, I guess you can call me a window shopper for sure, however, I do love a good shoe, and well, I find it hard to find one that fits well, keeps my feet comfy during work, and well that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. So when I am at the outlet mall, (usually when relatives are in town), I like to check the shoes. 

But, soon, the weather is gonna get colder, the Holidays are coming up fast and black Friday will soon be here. If you can stand the crowds, there is guarantee some great bargains so get out to the outlet mall to take advantage of them."}
{"text":"DO NOT LEAVE BAGS IN CAR. Shopping center owners have no regard for customers safety.

My brother--in-law went to our van to drop off bags. When we all went to the van someone had broken in and taken everything. We went to tell security. Apparently it happens ALL THE TIME. There is absolutely NO CAMERAS. NO SECURITY that goes around parking lot. There were other people whose cars had been broken into. 

At my local mall stores always ask me if i want the receipt or put in in the bag. Here at this mall EVERY store we went to automatically put it in the bag. We left all our bags in the car with their original receipt in them. We were later told by a local that on the street they cant get much for whatever they take but since the bags have the receipt in them they just go and get the cash back from the store. 

I know parking lots cannot be responsible for lost or stolen items. BUT to have no cameras and no security is an open invitation to crooks. People come here from all over the world and spend thousands of dollars and they can't add more security to a problem that apparently everyone around the area knows about."}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #13 - #365

OUTLET SHOPPING in Vegas!

You can't go wrong with shopping after Christmas with loads of clearance items on sale and many other deals to be had! My Mom's friend suggested to shop at the North Premium Outlets because they believed they had great deals. 

High end designers all around like Michael Kors, Godiva, Burburry, La Coste, Hugo Boss, Polo Ralph Lauren, True Religion and countless others that are located around the outlet. Parking in the garage wasn't a problem even though it was so packed with a long line of cars ready to park. Some stores like Tory Burch and Coach had long lines out he doors with waits as long as up to 2 hours. Shopping after Christmas has been a family tradition with excellent deals that you couldn't resist."}
{"text":"Make sure you come here in the morning and try to get most of your shopping done before noon because it gets HOT outside!! Then have a nice lunch at Cheesecake Factory and leave before you melt! Avoid the indoor food court - it's overpriced, crowded and the food is not that good. You're better off getting a lunch special at Cheesecake Factory and relax for an hour at a nice table. 

There's a Lululemon outlet here and you can find great deals on yoga clothes! This is the main reason I come to the Outlets."}
{"text":"Love this outlet!! My favorite shopping destination in Vegas!! Just try to stop by Tory burch first bc there's always a line in that freakin awesome store. Then u can make your ways to the other stores through this nice outlet mall. Food here sucks but who eats when you can shop. Just give me a bottle water & a Twix bar & I am good for 4 hrs of shopping galore. If u run out of water... Tory burch always provides great customer service & provide you with a can of soda or bottle water."}
{"text":"Seems like everything in Vegas is crazy with a capital Z.  The traffic was crazy, the parking was crazy, the crowds were crazy.

Unfortunately we had to shop. No, really, it was an emergency.  Brother's wedding reception that night. 

And that morning we discover in a moment of heart-stopping horror that we left my boyfriend's suit and all his fancy clothes in a garment bag. Hanging in a closet in a motel at the opposite end of Nevada. 

So. We hit the outlets hard and walked away with a passable sport coat, shirt, etc. 

Here's some tricks we used to survive:

- Follow the taxis. The street lay-out is a maze, the signage non-existent, you'll get lost on your own. Follow the guys who know where they're going.

- Skip the parking lot. Use the valet service.

- Time to leave? Give the valet dude a big-ass tip, and he'll get your car fast. Time = money.  You either pay with money or you pay with time. Your choice.

- Bring your own water bottle. The fountains don't work and the prices are crazy.

Crazy!"}
{"text":"Holy crap... stop the presses... 

I just found out the Disney Store Outlet here gets Disneyland park merchandise and sells it at a fraction of the cost.  I picked up an entire bag of $32 shirts marked down to $4.99 each.  What a find!  Why did I waste my time all of these years going to the AMS-run Disney Outlet in front of the (South) Las Vegas Premium Outlets at the other end of Las Vegas Blvd?

Oh, and I love the prices at the Coach store too.  Found a small wallet/ID holder for a gift for only $20. And last time I was here I got a cute LeSportsac bag (before i knew about the Disney Store)."}
{"text":"It used to be for me that there was an excitement in going to the LV Outlet...now somehow the excitement has faded and instead replaced with a sense of dread and frustration.  It's great seeing all the high end stores, but the quality of their outlet products are just not up to par.  Somehow I was under the impression, at least in the past, that the outlet products are the items that did not sell at the retail store...but now I am sensing that the companies specifically produce lower quality goods for their outlet stores and sell them at a \"discount\" price.  So during this last trip, we went to all the stores we wanted to go, looking for some great after Xmas buys only to be disappointed by the prices and quality.  In fact, we checked online for many of the products and found cheaper prices at the company's retail online store.  So why deal with the crowds, the pushing, waiting in line to get in stores, and the rude new wave of clientele when you can click some buttons and have it shipped to your house?"}
{"text":"Great place for people from Hawaii :) cheap prices everywhere and all of vegas's summer clothes is on clearance and super cheap!! :D

We can summer clothes everyday through out the year :)"}
{"text":"I wish I prepared my Christmas/Birthday list beforehand. I was really happy with the deals at baby/toddler clothing stores like Gymboree, Carters, and The Children's Place while Coach offered a 50% off coupon at the door which made deals better on handbags, wallets, wristlets, totes, etc. than any I could find online including ebay. 

There's pretty ample parking and during the hot summer months, refreshing water sprays along the walkways. For dining, there's a dependable California Pizza Kitchen which serves alcohol and other choices."}
{"text":"Had so much fun here with my family. Spent way too much money, and the place was really clean. Great deals, clean, and pretty good food court."}
{"text":"Great selection, superior service. We were able to get last year's Alexis Bittar's rings my friend was looking for a long time. Their selection of Lululemon was outstanding. And we left with our bags full of new running stuff. They also have many more premium brands to choose from than any Simon malls that are in North California"}
{"text":"Beware of the kiosk clerks. They can probably convince you to buy $10000000 face cream. Doctorates of sales these people are"}
{"text":"My favorite outlet in Las Vegas! There are so many stores here, and many of them are high brand (such as Burberry, Vince Camuto, Tumi, Dolce&Gabbana, etc.). You can be sure to go here and leave the outlet with both hands full of heavy shopping bags.

They also have stores such as Charlotte Russe and PacSun, for those of you who are not interested in high brand items, but are looking for good clothes at a discount! 

The most popular stores here would probably be Michael Kors, Kate Spade, and Polo Ralph Lauren. I'm probably missing a lot, but I always see shoppers carrying bags from those stores wherever I go.

They also have a cafeteria and many small shops to eat, in case you ever get hungry. I noticed that this outlet recently opened a Chipotle store as well!

The holiday and post-Christmas season seem to have the biggest sales, with a lot of stores boasting a clearance of at least 50-70% off. If you visit Las Vegas, you need to shop here to make your vacation complete!"}
{"text":"Go early in the morning! You'll beat the heat and the parking scarcity! I bought Tory burch sandals and flats for the price of 1! Francesca's is also buy one get one 50%!!! My grand total was as much as one thing would have been!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this outlet. I love that it has most the stores I need when shopping for the brood. However, I stay away and dont ever think to come to this outlet during any holiday. ANY.HOLIDAY. While I'm happy with its latest additions of stores and restaurants and parking. Parking still sucks and i don't have the patience for it. But we're smart about it now...if we must come...we go a bit later in the evening rather than hours where tourists have awoken, had their breakfast/lunch, and are ready to donate to.our economy. I like to go when everyone iz thinking it's getting dark, dinner is approaching, feet tired, etc...lol. That'd be the best bet you won't be sitting in traffic...in a parking garage.  Other than that...it's a vibrant place to roam around and get some shopping done. Well, except for when it's summer. Eek.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love these outlets. This is a must place to stop when in Vegas. It has the best stores, and great service inside all the stores. The only one downside is that it is outdoors and when it is hot it sucks because shopping in the heat is no fun- but all the stores have AC blasting so that's a major plus. 
These outlets have all the best stores and always have great sales- so it really deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"like all outlet. its pack. their tory burch outlet isnt really an outlet. other then tory burch i dont know if ill come again."}
{"text":"Lots of walking.  4 stars because the bathroom was super gross.  But everything else was great.  Shopping from bargains to luxury."}
{"text":"We spent an afternoon here. I love all the high end stores that they had to offer. The place is pretty big so a lot of walking. It's outdoor setting so you will get a lots of sun tan. Very clean environment."}
{"text":"This is one of two outlet centers I like to shop when visiting LV to catch some great deals. There are 2 parking structures, and the first couple of parking floors are packed. Some advice - park at the top! No one parks up there!!! Yes, it may take a while to get up there due to the slow traffic, but it's well worth the wait.

Food court could be better, but I don't generally stay here long enough to eat a meal. 

I typically shop at:
-Burberry
-J. Crew
-Ken Cole
-FCUK
-BR
-CK
-Lancome store"}
{"text":"Pro's -  Best outlet shopping I've ever experienced.  Got both a Coach and Dooney Bag for under 100.00 each.  Tank tops at Banana Republic for 4 bucks.  Got my son some shirts for 5 bucks each and some dress clothes from Gap for under a 100 bucks for two shirts and two pants.  Husband got two Quicksilver shorts for 50 bucks.  We could have done a lot more damage but our time was limited.

Con's -  It was hot!  But then it was our choice to travel to Vegas in the middle of July.  There were busloads of foreign tourist who push and shove their way around the place, especially in the Coach and Dooney store.  At the Dooney store this lady was giving the salesgirl a hard time because she couldn't use this coupon she had for an additional 10% off on a particular item."}
{"text":"This place gets packed early like around 11am.  It's an outdoor setup.  Food court isn't very big and I don't think there are any restaurants.  Items aren't that cheap here and yet people had bags and bags of stuff.  There are a lot of tourists that come here.

Oh and the customers are very rude and obnoxious.  People walk like they own the entire walk area.  Oddly enough sales staff are very friendly and helpful.  I've never seen so many smokers in a shopping area before but then again this is Las Vegas. 

Parking sucks. Maybe because it's still under construction.  They have some high end shops."}
{"text":"I wandered through a couple of the stores and can't say that I was all that impressed with their offerings. Some of the major stores like Guess and Diesel offer better deals in their regular stores when they have sales and you don't have to deal with the madness and chaos that the Outlets can be on a busy day. I'm told that season transition time is not the best time for bargains, so i'll go back in the summer and see what they have.

 Today a man head butted me while he tried to jump for a shirt. It was an accident (carelessness on my part, I'm sure, for standing still in plain sight) and no fault of the store that I was in, but I probably won't go back again unless it's the middle of the day on a weekday when tourist season is low.
 
 Being outside on a mild day is the best part of the experience. The shopping; well, I left empty handed."}
{"text":"I know these stores as the Charleston outlets as it's right off the 15 freeway and Charleston exit. It's all about the Nike Factory store for me here but I have scored some nice work clothes at Gap & Banana Republic. So many stores... It's an outdoor outlet mall so prepare yourself when it's hot out. It can be draining walking around... They've organized the parking so you can see by color green or red whether the parking space is open or not from afar. Bring your patience as this place gets packed every day of the week and especially on weekends."}
{"text":"It's an outdoor outlet in the desert! Lots of my favorite stores to shop at! When we came here, it was super crowded and parking was such a pain. However, there's great deals for shopping."}
{"text":"These outlets have become a required detour on every trip to Vegas. I particularly like the Tumi and Kenneth Cole outlets here. A Tumi Outlet is a rare thing. It's worth going to Vegas just for this Outlet store."}
{"text":"This place is good if the weather permits. If it is super hot or super cold dont go. Its all out doors. I like the south one more because it is indoors."}
{"text":"There are a multitude of shops, including Guess, VanHeusen, and Kay. Obviously, the prices are expensive. Lots of people are here everyday. Not many parking spaces are available during the signature rush hour."}
{"text":"Odd layout for people who've never been there before.  I'm actually pretty good with directions and when I thought we'd gone the entire loop, I was all turned around.

Otherwise, it's a pretty cool outlet mall with a decent selection of stores.  Vending machines and snack vendors everywhere in case you need a break from shopping.

Plenty of parking with reliable indicators if a parking spot is free (no more false starts only to find out a small car or motorcycle is parked in a stall).  

Bring your credit cards! (But spend responsibly.)"}
{"text":"I wanted to do some shopping on Black Friday here - apparently everyone else in town wanted to do the same! It took at least 30 minutes just to try to get into the parking structure. It was mayhem. 
 
This outlet has some great stores - a little something for everyone. I think this place caters to a lot of international tourists. There were definitely long lines for the designer stores. I avoided any store with long lines outside of the stores. I found a lot of shoe stores to carry small sizes so if you're a size 5-6, then you're in luck!

The layout of this place is chaotic - it's kinda laid out like a spider web. Plus, there's so many shoppers during the holiday. Half the battle was trying to get through the crowd. There were definitely some good deals, but I don't know if I would bear the crowd again during a major holiday."}
{"text":"It was overcrowded and it was hard to find the parking garage. I wasn't that impressed with the sales. We went to Sketchers shoes outlet and it was overcrowded and small. People were throwing boxes everywhere and it was felt like I was in a can of tuna, just awful. The employees were rude and had no clue how to assist customers."}
{"text":"Wow, women everywhere, eye candy everywhere. My favorite spot for free eye candy while I do a little shopping. A must visit every time i'm in lv."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Premium Outlet is just alright. I wish it had MORE stores, but I work with what they have. I don't often shop here anymore because parking is horrible and I can't stand shopping when it's hot or too frickin' cold. So this place is definitely the LAST place that I go to for my shopping therapy. The food court is alright... Not too many selections. They have a Dairy Queen, two Chinese food places, Subway, a pizza place, and an up-and-coming Philly Cheesesteak place. They used to have a Makino's here, but that place closed. 

Would I shop here in the future? Eh, yes but rarely. I only come here for their super discounted prices on high-end brand names. Other than that, I like to feel comfortable when I shop around.. Not sweating my bawls off and feeling gross."}
{"text":"Overall, I have to say that I was very impressed with these outlets. They have a lot of shops even though it's outdoors. I'd recommend going in the early morning so it's not too hot out (they also have the spritzer machines to keep you cool). Although there's only a handful of shops that I was interested in going to, they all had good (and current) selections at deeply discounted prices (compared to the regular stores). I imagine that this place gets pretty busy during the weekend so go early and go during the weekdays possible."}
{"text":"Premium outlets!! Hurray! This place is one of the better ones I've been to. 

This outlet has a great selection of stores, such as Nike factory, Express, Bose, Coach, Coach MEN, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Adidas, Gap, Banana Republic, Mark Ecko, Dolce & Gabbana, Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Ann Taylor, and much more. 

Parking sucks, so I would suggest going with a cab or UBER (now that they are LEGAL). My cousins drove us there and left us, so we decided to use uber ($13-18 ride). According to my friend Janice C., the cab ride from Mandalay Bay hotel is $20.

Small food court with selections such as Subway, Great Steak, Italia Express, etc. 

The outlets architect looks awesome, but while walking inside, I'm not a big fan, especially on cold days.. From what I looked, it was basically 2 U's - to get from one U to the second, you'd have to step outside Dx

As for crowds, they are pretty crowded during the winter time..... Holiday shopping and post-Christmas sales lol. For Michael Kors, there was a line, so if you're there during winter time, bring a jacket, gloves, and a scarf!!"}
{"text":"Normally, I love the Premium Outlets as they are scattered all over the U.S. But I guess it depends on the season you're going so sales and product offerings can vary depending on your timing. When I was there in early March, I have to say I was super disappointed. Not a lot of sales and not a lot of good selection.

I think  Woodbury Common Outlet in New York and Seattle Premium Outlets are my favourite in terms of sales and selection. I mean they all have similar stores but I didn't find much at the Vegas North Outlet. Some of the stores I did like were: White House Black Market (small store though), Banana Republic, Gap, Nike (no real sales, felt like a regular store), Carters, Coach etc.

Cabbing it here from the Palazzo hotel was $16 each way. You can also take the bus but make sure you take the Express and not the Deuce, as the latter one will take much longer since it stops way  more often. 

There are two Premium Outlets, the other one is in the south near the Airport. The south outlet is indoor but it's not as nice as this one in the north. The mall seemed clean and didn't seem to be super busy on a Tuesday afternoon so that was nice."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best outlets I've ever gone to. The Vegas outlets have a HUGE selection. Not just of stores, but of things at the stores. And it's only a 5-10 minute cab ride away from the strip (about $15 each way). 

You'll find pretty much all the high end designers here, as well as mid-range places too. All of the stores have great selection and carry a variety of sizes (not just XL and XXL!). Some noteworthy things I got was a BCBG dress (originally $280) for $40. And my boyfriend got Ferragamo sunglasses for $99 (usually $300+)! 

The only slight downsides are that it's outdoors and you have to put up with the Vegas sun and heat. The food court and bathrooms also aren't all that clean. But who cares when you find a great deal!!!"}
{"text":"i came here three times on a six day trip to vegas, nuff said."}
{"text":"This is a must-stop every time I go to Vegas. It's designer discount heaven. But even outside of that (because a purse discounted to $300 from $900 is still $300), they have normal store outlets that can score you some killer deals. I walk away with at least two bags at every visit. 

Hit up: J Crew, Banana Republic, Gap, Coach, Kate Spade, Juicy, Levis & Perry Ellis.

Pass on: Burberry. While I can appreciate a good deal, you just won't find it there. At least, I haven't!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite outlet malls!  I always try to stop here when I'm in town.  There are a lot of great brands that you don't find everywhere -Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman, Joe's Jeans - as well as the favorites - BCBG, J.Crew, etc.

Too bad it's outdoor, but most outlet malls are.  If you're staying on the Strip, cab fare is less than $20, so it may not be worth taking the shuttle if you're going in a group anyway.

After shopping, the Makino seafood buffet isn't bad, especially if you're looking to save a few bucks after your shopping spree.  Certainly cheaper than a buffet on the Strip."}
{"text":"I personally did not care for this outlet. I was sadly surprised that the Michael Kors store was extremely big, but they didn't sell clothing! My husband loves going to outlets in whatever state we are in smh. Anyways, I found more things for myself at the shops on the strip, such as Fashion Show."}
{"text":"THE best outlet mall in vegas, or maybe even in america?  teehee.  on a regular old day, it's great.  their variety of stores are excellent and there's so many, it takes the whole day to go through ALL of them.  burberry, le sportsac, coach, juicy couture, bebe, french connection, pacsun, ecko, zoo york, quiksilver, bcbg, stuart weitzman, the list goes on and on.  however, if you come here on black friday, prepare yourself for no parking whatsoever and people trampling on you at 4 in the morning."}
{"text":"They started to charge  $5 for parking.  Ridiculous to pay for parking at an outlet mall.  Even the casinos give you 1 hour free.  The stores are just ok and prices not great so not worth paying the parking charge.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Best thing about this outlet mall - the Steve Madden store. Got amazing deals on super cute shoes!!"}
{"text":"This mall has my favorite stores (Adidas, Oakley & Timberland) along with some of my \"Tier 2\" favorites - Puma, Quiksilver & Nike.

It gets really busy and so I would recommend getting here when it opens.  There is a multi-story parking structure attached to the mall.

This owner of this mall (Simon Malls I think) has a VIP shopper club you can sign up for online and then get a coupon to pick up a coupon book at the mall information office which has even more discounts on a lot of the stores (never Oakley though which is frustrating).

It is a couple of different buses to get here from the Strip - or about a $30 cab ride and so if you compare that to the cost of a rental car you can probably save money by getting a rental car for your trip to Vegas).

The food court here is pretty terrible and so I would either eat before, or stay hungry and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Shops open at 10 am but if you get there a little early they have a Starbucks to kick back at.  Parking can be a pain, so if you're a serious shopper, get there about 9:45 and you'll be fine... except during the holidays like Christmas, where's nothing can help you."}
{"text":"This place is nothing more than a shopping trap for those looking for good outlet deals. It seems like it is made primarily for tourists coming in on busses. Waves of people walk around and crowd up stores, bathrooms, and the small amount of eateries here. A lot of them buy big rolling luggages and lug them around the outlet. 

Anyways, let me start from the beginning,

Parking - We almost didn't even come here after driving around for 30 minutes looking for parking and finding nothing. The parking garage is horrible despite telling you how many spots are available. We came at the wrong time (130pm on a Saturday) and there were \"0\" spots available on all floors except the roof where the electric sign read \"300+\" spots free. Awesome, except when we got to the roof, there were no spots there either. Absolute useless sign. In fact some cars even parked where you're not supposed to park. Cars were circling everywhere and these people can't drive. You end up giving each floor a second chance and finding no difference. One person even reserved a parking spot by standing in the spot where a car is supposed to be. I guess their car was like 6 cars behind a trail of angry drivers passing up an otherwise available spot. We gave up and were already driving out when unfortunately we found someone was leaving so we pulled right in. Taking the bridge across to the outlet was non eventful. 

Outlet - you will want to take a quick glance over the directory. Not for the stores (let's face it, you're gonna walk all the way around anyways and hit em  all up) but for the food court and bathrooms. If you walk around in the middle of the day, there is no shade. Small shade sails might block 1% of the sun. Be prepared to bake from store to store. There are air mister fans than attempt to blow cool mist onto you as you pass beneath, but it's so damn hot it evaporates before it reaches you. 

Stores - you will soon find out that:

1) most of the stores are regular stores. Maybe 1 out of 20 stores are actually considered outlet stores. Basically they're just fillers to accept your money or the money of tourists willing to waste their money on regular items. 

2) no deals here unless you buy more than you want. Almost every store will say \"buy one, get another for xx% off\". you want a deal on crocs? Expect to buy three pairs just for the discount. Or get a discount on oakleys if you first pay full price for the first pair. There are far better discounts online on their company sites and you don't need to buy more than you need. 

3) there's not too many food stores. It's very weak compared to their sister outlet \"las Vegas south premium outlets\" which I recommend over this place. They are indoors, have two food courts, and less touristy. 

I think I could go on and on with this ridiculous place, but I'll stop here. I don't know why people would even like this place enough to recommend it. They obviously have never been to a real outlet. Definitely skip this place at all cost."}
{"text":"We like to go to the outlets. This is one of the better ones.  Of course not in the summer. Nice and cool in November."}
{"text":"I liked it....pretty much the same as the other ones you see. The staff were super helpful. There were deals if you looked a bit....even with the CDN/US exchange. Take an Uber or Lyft!"}
{"text":"We finished 90% of our shopping before even checking into the hotel later in the day.  Glad we went early because the crowds and lines stat to dominate this place later in the afternoon.

Be prepared with a map because it is a bit maze like and easy to become disoriented if it is your first visit.  The store indexes do not have a \"You are Here\" star on them.  So you may likely find yourself along with a group of others trying to figure out your location."}
{"text":"The best time to go there is during the week, on a sunny day, bc parking and cold weather can be difficult in this outdoor mall.  However, they usually have incredible deals on brands and I never left there without a great bargain."}
{"text":"I'm the dude who usually hates shopping.

I'm the dude who holds all the shopping bags for his wife. I'm the dude who sits on those little girly chairs or sofas next to the fitting room waiting for his wife to try on clothes.

I'm the dude who ONLY likes going to this outlet in Vegas and spent a whopping 3 hours shopping here last weekend... and had a good time doing it."}
{"text":"A morning visit at 10:30.AM to the North Premium Outlet Mall was surprisingly hassle free. 

We easily parked in the north tower. The green light/red light system made the process of locating a place to park easy to spot. 

The corridors amongst the store venues were open and unpopulated. I smiled as I did not see crowds of huddled shoppers. 

After a purchase from the Quicksilver store, the clerk kindly offered me a map  to help me navigate towards O'Neill, Hurley, and Volcom. Also, there are customer service agents and kiosks who helped direct us to our destinations.

Back-to-School sales have begun.  The Gap, Le Sports Sac, Gymboree, A Children's Place, Nautica Kids are just a handful of stores ready for kids and their school year. Puma and Disney Store both have promotions this month, so check the website before you venture off into the maze of stores to help with strategic shopping.

Our morning jaunt ended with lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. The service was immediate and hospitable. James, our server, provided A+ service and attention.  The Chopped Salad was fresh. Also the crispy and supple kids' menu chicken tenders and perfectly grilled kids' menu salmon were well prepared. We sipped on three types of lemonade: raspberry, cucumber, and original. The beverage refills were free. Kids' drinks were included with their menu option."}
{"text":"if you want to buy better stuff go to Fashion Show Mall , wait for a holliday or sales ... better quality better stuff better everything
this outlet is more like a trap , it only makes you think you get a bargain but in reality you only get out of fashion left overs :)
Peace and love !"}
{"text":"Hot as hell during the summer.  Who thought of having an outdoor mall by Vegas?  lol.  Oh well, at least there are these water spritzer machines.  Doesnt' really help.  I guess the outdoorness makes people stay inside the shops more.

Nothing really special about this outlet tbh.

Parking suckssssssssssss!"}
{"text":"I am basing this review mostly on the trip I took there about 2 weeks ago. I originally gave 5 stars to this outlet because it has three of my favorite stores.1. Tory Burch 2. Michael Kors 3. Kate Spade, but I took one star off because according to my bf's sister the parking is horrendous when it is busy and compared to Hawaii, people in the mainland are even crazier when it comes to limited parking. Also I have been to this outlet during the summer and they have those \"mist\" machines to help cool you down. Sadly I'm a short girl so in those times of dry LV heat, the mist evaporates before it reaches me. 

There were lines for Tory Burch and Michael Kors, but we only waited about 7-10 minutes. I found really good deals and used the \"I'm on vacation\" logic and bought what I pleased hahaha! Well, until we got to Kate Spade and I was reminded that we needed to bring all this back home..

They have alot of other stores like Guess, Marciano by Guess, Aldo, Sketchers, Coach, and so much more. They also have a food court and Starbucks. 

I would recommend this outlet over the one in the South any day! Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Brands are expanding, each time we come, always see new brands in. Product styles are very updated. Many products are selling here which we cannot find in LA's outlets. Awesome!"}
{"text":"What can u say that hasn't already been said? This place is awesome for those who don't live  in metropolitan areas. It offers all the major brand names at outlet prices. Being ur comfy shoes!!!"}
{"text":"So i got dragged here by women... but I have to say that not only was it interesting to look at all these premium stores (places I would normally not ever go to) but also to see some of the deals.  Defiantly a place to get some good clothing cheep!  Even the Disney store had some nice deals on stuffed animals.  The outdoor part was nice, despite it being a little cold. Parking is abundant in the garage and its free.  If you have some free time when in Vegas, its worth spending an hour or two bargain hunting."}
{"text":"By far the best service I have received in...Forever!! I was in search of a LeSportSac backpack (Polynesian Paradise pattern) and it was SOLD OUT on-line, so I contacted the LV outlet store and spoke w/ Alyssa. She knew exactly what item I wanted and said it was in stock and 40% off what I would have paid elsewhere. Glorious!!! She shipped my item that day and I received it the following day! Wow, that was fast!!!! She even included a nice, hand-written \"Thank You\" note! I'm impressed!!!  All stores & customer service personnel, \"TAKE NOTE!\" This is how a GREAT store is run & done! Thanks Alyssa & LeSportSac! You guys are awesome!!! If I had a megaphone, I would announce it to the world...good thing there's YELP! LOL! ;)"}
{"text":"The fact that there is a Tory Burch outlet there is all I needed to know.  There are some really great stores.  Like most outlets - you really have to make sure you're getting a good deal."}
{"text":"i used to live in vegas and i would frequent these outlets. its ALOT better than the outlets on the south side of vegas (on las vegas blvd... before the strip). they have everything you could want... the only reasons why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was cuz its outdoor (its gets hot as a mofo in vegas come summertime) and its down the 15 freeway a little bit (like 10 mins or so). but other than that its a cool spot so check check check it out"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas kann man zwischen zwei verschiedenen Outlets, den Las Vegas Premium Outlets - North und South ausw√§hlen. Von der Auswahl und Anzahl der L√§den h√∂rte sich das Outlet in der Downtown von Las Vegas interessanter an. Es war auch nur knapp 3 Kilometer von unserem Hotel entfernt.

Wer es einrichten kann, sollte hier fr√ºh morgens zum Shoppen gehen, dann findet man bequem einen Parkplatz im Parkhaus und ist nicht der sengenden Hitze ausgesetzt. Dar√ºber hinaus hat man fast leere und aufger√§umte L√§den ohne nervende Dr√§ngelei.

In den ca. 150 Stores findet man unter anderem Adidas, Benetton, Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, Levi's/Dockers Outlet, Nautica, Nike Factory Store, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Puma, Reebok, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger und viele weitere.

F√ºr das leibliche Wohl ist dort auch gesorgt. Man findet hier beispielsweise Amorino Gelato, Auntie Anne's Soft Pretzels, The Cheesecake Factory, Dairy Queen, Kung Pao Wok, South Philly Cheesesteaks & Fries, Starbucks Coffee und Subway.

Unser zweiter Besuch am Nachmittag war allerdings nicht so angenehm. Die Parkplatzsuche war im Parkhaus doch sehr m√ºhevoll und die L√§den waren sehr voll. Sehr unangenehm empfand ich die unertr√§gliche Hitze und der st√§ndige Wechsel in die klimatisierten Stores. 

Die Premium Outlets North sind t√§glich ge√∂ffnet. Die √ñffnungszeiten sind von Montag bis Samstag von 9.00 Uhr bis 21.00 Uhr und am Sonntag von 9.00 Uhr bis 20.00 Uhr. Insgesamt fand ich die Angebote und Reduzierungen nicht so reizvoll, kann aber auch daran liegen, dass der letzte USA-Urlaub noch nicht so lange her ist. Wer noch weiterf√§hrt, kann in anderen Outlets sicherlich bessere Schn√§ppchen machen."}
{"text":"The stores in the outlet is amazing. Kate spade and Neman Marcus had the best offers.
It s pretty close to the best rated restaurants and the food court was also pretty good with DQ. Had coconut and strawberry smoothie at DQ and loved it. 
Don't forget to check out BeBe and BCBG for great offers. I'd love to see forever 21 and other stores in the outlet. 
Overall had a great time shopping !"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best, if not the best outlet malls i have seen in the US.  They literally have everything here!

Nice outdoor environment.  The place is clean and orderly.  

Stocked up on some amazing deals here."}
{"text":"There's free parking and a lot of stores to choose from! I'm lucky to have a good self control or else I would go broke!

Only bad thing is the weather!!! Vegas! Why you got to be so hot?!

:D"}
{"text":"This place is really not that far from the Vegas strip, yet offers slew of high-end outlet stores (Burberry, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, etc) along with more contemporary and \"everyday\" selections. Tip: Traffic can get pretty bad around popular dates/times (I was there during the Thanksgiving weekend) and the Uber will only drop you off/pick up at certain areas - this is strictly reinforced!"}
{"text":"I didn't find the prices to match that of other outlets by the same company. Premium Outlets in Gulfport, Ms were much cheaper, these seemed more like retail prices. But it's Vegas so you expect to fork out the extra cash for everything I suppose. 
The parking made me want to jump off the top of the garage. I highly suggest installing speed bumps in there, people were driving all sorts of crazy and PASSING other vehicles at high speeds in the garage as the security guards on their segways directed traffic for no reason on the bottom floor."}
{"text":"The mall just imposes $5 parking fee for out residents cars. If you are not happy with this unusual charge, avoid this mall."}
{"text":"Not the best Premium Outlet I've been to, but it did have most of the things we were looking for. Levi's Kids is located in the branch in the south, we were told. 
The shops are located outside, which is nice when you are trying to avoid death by air-conditioning.
Sign up ahead of time for their VIP program (on their website) to get a free coupon book for extra savings. Otherwise, you can buy the book for a few dollars. It really is worth it, though. 
Small food court, but who's there to eat? Unless it's at The Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"As far as outlet malls go, this is by far the best one within 100 miles! Before they opened up LV Premium Outlets in Downtown, I used to travel all the way to Primm for any outlet shopping. Now, I just have to hop on the I-15 going the other direction and boom! I am there!

Another great things about LVPO is their variety of high end stores. Personally this means more to the girlfriend then it does to me. However, a happy girlfriend = happy me."}
{"text":"This place is called a outlet but junk . Prices are the same as shopping at the regular stores . Nothing to be found here ."}
{"text":"I've worked a stone's throw from this mega mall for 10 years but never go. Well, I used to go until the crowds got to be too much. 
I was enticed to return by VEGAS mag for a sneak preview of the brand new Neiman Marcus Last Call store, which is within the mall's latest expansion. There have been major renovations to the mall since my last visit years ago. The addition of Cheesecake Factory will certainly increase my number of visits!
Nice selection of stores, but I don't find the prices to be true \"outlet\" pricing or much of a bargain. I'm used to the true Outlet Malls of the past where bargains were aplenty. Of course some stores do have good deals and isn't half the fun in the hunt?"}
{"text":"It was a lovely day of shopping at the las vegas outlet mall. by the time me and my friend were finished shopping we visited the bathrooms next to the info center, they were awfully hot with AC at all and therefore where also smelling very badly. I strongly suggest for people to wait to go to the bathroom until they get to a different location. Hopefully whoever is responsible will fix that because it absolutely ruins a nice day of shopping!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is an outdoor outlet mall located just a few minutes away from Downtown Las Vegas and The Strip.  Why do they have outdoor malls in the desert?  Well, it beats me because I couldn't bear the heat when I to these outlets in August so my shopping trip here was very short lived.  I imagine they would make more money in the cooler, winter months because when I went there once in November, I spent almost the entire day there.  The nice thing though, about these outlets, is that there are these water misting sprays scattered around the mall to cool you down from the heat.  The water spray is light and doesn't help a whole lot but it's better than nothing.  The last time I went, there was also a shave ice/snow cone truck called \"Kona Ice\" to help cool you down.     
      
Despite this mall being outdoors, I normally enjoy shopping here.  There are a lot of good stores here including Tory Burch (sometimes the store gets really packed so they make people form a line outside to wait), Rue21, Zumies, Michael Kors, Guess Factory Store, Bebe, and they even have an outlet store that sells show tickets.  There's a food court and a few snack kiosks as well.  
  
Overall, timing is everything at these outlets.  If you go during the summer, you will have to find a way to tolerate the heat.  There are multiple parking lots and structures but sometimes the outlets get so busy that you may have a hard time finding a stall.  The first time I shopped here, I had no trouble finding parking.  The second time I shopped here, I had to circle the lot a few times to find an open stall.  Their operating hours are pretty good as they usually close at 9 pm and are open on major holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day (shorter hours)."}
{"text":"This is one the top outlets I've been to in the USA! I come here every time I am in Vegas and always find some great deals. There is a big selection of stores for men, most notably Diesel, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole, Energie, and all the fitness brands like Nike, Puma, Adidas, and DC Shoes. There is a lack of food options, but I don't come here to eat. I come here to buy clothes! A bonus is the new ACE Gold Line comes here from The Strip!"}
{"text":"I've been to both Premium Outlets North and South this trip and found the North to be wayyy better. I will not go back to the South. The North Outlets are newer, have better stores and alot of visitors shop there. The sales people are also nicer. North outlets are outdoors (open mall) sucks when its really cold or hot, and can be difficult to follow the map and find stores sometimes. It can be alil confusing navigating around.  (but its worth it) The South is enclosed but just sucks all the way around. It's older and mostly locals shop there, it's alil more urban if you know what I mean. Also, both outlets carry different merchandise and when I went to the same stores at both, I found nicer things at the North Outlet."}
{"text":"Deals in every store around every turn never gets old. Lots of variety with the shops with a good mix of luxury brands and popular labels. Super easy to get to from the stripe with tons of taxi available.  Impressed with the restaurants that have opened - nothing wrong with a food fair  but nice to have the extra variety."}
{"text":"Great place to get the quality stylish goods at a discount from the designer prices!"}
{"text":"Great deals here! If you have AAA membership, you can go to the information booth to get a coupon book for free! Otherwise, if you want one you need to pay $10 for one. Bought a whole bunch of items from belts, shirts, polos to purses and wallets. Great deals and sales! That's what an outlet is meant for!"}
{"text":"A large, outdoor outlet mall with some of the best deals I've ever come across! They've got a lot of the good brands!!! Just to name some places I've shopped at: 

Armani Exchange, Armani
Bose, Fossil
Nike, Adidas, The North Face, Puma
Alex and Ani, Pandora
Disney Store, Kate Spade
Tory Burch, Michael Kors, Aldo
Asics, Journeys, Lululemon

They have a Starbucks, an Auntie Anne's, and a Cheesecake Factory. A food course. They just recently opened a Shake Shack.

Many foreigners shop here and I don't blame them. Don't be surprised when it's busy and hard to find parking. A lot of places have 50-70% off! You can find great deals here and there's lots of coupons flying around! Definitely a place I love to splurge at."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I make a trip out to Vegas, this is one place we always stop at. This is one of the nicest outlet malls that I've ever been to. They have a lot of high-end stores here, and also some that aren't. Among the stores that we love: Oakley, Michael Kors, Coach, Nike, Wilson's Leather, Ralph Lauren, and Skechers. There are definitely deals to be had. On our most recent trip, I scored a purse at Coach for $79! And my husband got a pair of custom made Oakley sunglasses for under $200. 

Keep in mind, this is a strictly outdoor mall, so it definitely feels like a desert atmosphere in the summer months. But they do have water misting fans scattered throughout that you can walk under. And the stores do a great job of staying air conditioned.

There is a huge parking structure, so there is ample parking. And they have one is one thing that should be a standard feature in all structures. Above each parking space, there is a light that indicates whether the spot is open or taken (red for taken, green for open). Why has this not become a common feature?! 

Another thing that I like about this mall is that fact that it's not overrun with kiosks like the South outlet mall is. I am not a fan of mall kiosks to begin with. Not all kiosk employees are like this, but a decent number of them jump out and yell at you like carnival barkers. \"Try this new hand scrub!\" \"Let me clean your jewelry with this awesome cleaner made from the tears of royalty!\" So, thank you for not having too many kiosks. 

I am looking forward to the next trip to Vegas (even though it hasn't been planned yet. It's not a matter of if, but when), and the next trip to this mall."}
{"text":"land of XL's and bad shoes. This place isn't bad, but it has too many \"shoe pavilion\" type stores and old man type stores like Izod or Geoffrey Beene for me. AX, D&G, FCUK, Guess, Calvin Klein, and Kenneth Cole are some of the better stores, but you still need some luck to find something thats a good deal AND your size. Found a Small AX jacket for $30 among the piles of XL's, so i'm happy.

And like someone said, it is HOT outside! i found myself hopping into one bad store after the next  just to avoid the sun - wouldnt be so bad if they were better stores. This place needs a Queer Eye makeover."}
{"text":"very good outlet. they had THEORY (which was disappointing!) and Tory Burch (but still kinda pricey for me)
However, I did get some stuff from BR and Kate Spade so I was happy. 
Food court needs an upgrade though, yikes!"}
{"text":"Small location with few shops. There are pretty good deals here though. Nice quiet place to be when you want to be away from the crowd in Vegas. I really loved the employees at Coach in particular; everyone was extremely friendly and personable."}
{"text":"This was a great excursion from the madness of the Strip. Take the fast, clean, cheap gold-line buses from the Strip to get there. Get some sightseeing from the expansive bus windows done on the way killing two birds with one stone! 

I managed to find several great steals here and I found the prices comparable to our premium outlets back home so yayy for no Vegas premiums. They have many of the outlet mall staples including Coach, Kenneth Cole, Diesel, Burberry, Dooney & Burke, Guess, etc. Pretty extensive food court and the mall is setup out-side with plenty of little rest areas throughout. 

The only caveat is that there was few stores here that we didn't have at our Premium Outlets at home in DC so if you have one near you or you're time pressed you can skip it!"}
{"text":"This place is HUGE! Apparently, it's one of the largest outdoor mall in the U.S. 

I've been coming here for many years and everytime I stop in I MUST check out FCUK, but it's closed down! =( So sad. I did go to the FCUK in the Fashion Show Mall, but it's just not the same.  Many top ends store here and a awesome Hookah kiosk which almost suckered me into buying a Hookah."}
{"text":"This rating is not based on the stores but based on the parking... Unless you're a Nevada resident you have to pay for parking. It may be only five bucks but why the fee??? Go to the other mall Primm, they have the same great stores and you don't have to pay to park.. also its indoors, you can keep cool while shopping"}
{"text":"Outdoor outlets and it is no fun in the summer heat.  Great store selections.  Lots of good restaurants in the mall, so you don't have to drive somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of outlet malls, but I do enjoy this location from time to time. I like that outdoor aspect of this location. The worst part about this mall is the parking. I never seem to be able to find anything close and the parking structures are always a nightmare. I try to park in the uncovered parking at any cost. 

There are a few stores that I enjoy, especially the Coach, Kate Spade, Fossil and Gap outlets. I don't come here often, usually when I have friends visiting from out of town or when I'm doing some last minute holiday shopping. 

All in all, it's a pretty enjoyable shopping experience here especially during weekdays when it's less busy."}
{"text":"We come here almost every time, if we are staying in Vegas a few nights.  My wife can find nice gifts at bargain prices.  We hardly ever leave empty handed.  They have plenty of stores and parking.

The best time to come here is during the middle of the week when school is still in session.  There are less crowds and better deals to be found.

I would give them 5 stars, but because the outlet is outdoors I have to subtract a star.  The summers can be unbearable here."}
{"text":"Wow this is THE outlet mall to go to!  Everything you need they probably have.  Some of the stores had no deals so don't think you HAVE to purchase something just because it's at an outlet mall, and know you may be able to get a better deal at a regular department store or online.  That being said, I was able to find some great deals here.  This wouldn't have normally been a 5 star rating, but every employee I ran into, whether it be at a store or outside was very helpful and pleasantly courteous.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Like all premium outlets, you'll need a whole day for shopping.  The plus is that the stores are located in buildings which are close to each other as opposed to being separated by roads ALA Gilroy Premium Outlets.  However, there are no Mickey Ds or Sbarros to get your burger/fry or pizza/spaghetti fix going!"}
