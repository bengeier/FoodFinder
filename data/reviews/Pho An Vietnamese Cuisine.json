{"text":"I've been searching for some decent Pho in the south part of Calgary.  Out of all the places I've tried, this one is the best by far (although, still not my favourite).  When I get a hankering for rare beef pho with a side of spring rolls, this is where I'll be going...at least until I find that elusive favourite.  Still, will worth it and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"There is much better in available in Calgary. Portions were less than normal, spring roll and vermecelli was chopped into small pieces. Tables, walls and doors were dirty! Bad choice!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  I have been coming here for a few years and have tried a few different plates and haven't been disappointed.  It is nice and quiet, everyone smiles and are fast but not pushy.  Clean washrooms and nice d√©cor.  The background music is authentic.  Not loud high pitched singing like some places."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, had the chicken pho. It was excellent. The owners actually run the place they were very nice, we were seated fast and our food was out in a few minutes after ordering. I will visit next time I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! We went a while ago with a group of 6 and we all got something different, and it was all amazing! Particularly the crispy noodles with mixed veggies and meats (Cantonese chow mien) and the curry chicken soup. The curry was nice and spicy and super flavorful. I had a few bites of my mom's vermicelli and it was very tasty with lots of meat. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty uninspired Vietnamese food. Went there for lunch and wasn't impressed that I was the only one there at noon hour.  Shortly joined by only one other person in the 40 minutes I was there. Ordered the standards of Salad rolls and a Beef Pho.  The peanut sauce was not tasty at all and the soup was sub par, no flavor and the noodles overcooked and falling apart. I would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"I walked in at 1pm on a Saturday and the lunch rush was ending. I ordered a pho tai - rare beef noodles - with a durian milkshake. The server was very friendly and struck up a conversation. I got my meal promptly and while it wasn't super amazing (the beef was already cooked by the time it arrived, and the milkshake didn't have a strong enough durian taste), I had a great experience eating there."}
{"text":"What do you do when hunger strikes? Well if you're me and you're out on a Sunday driving by a Vietnamese restaurant, you pull over and dine.  I have to say I didn't really hear anything about this place; we just saw it and on impulse decided to go in and stuff our faces.  I found the staff friendly and we got seated right away. The menu had the usual fair and I didn't find anything really super exciting about it. We ordered shrimp salad rolls to start, which were alright- I did not like the peanut sauce it came with. The vermicelli bowl we decided to share was good, no complaints but nothing to write home about.   Overall I enjoyed my meal like I usually do with Vietnamese food... and that's a wrap!"}
{"text":"Too timid in spicing and seasoning. The result was bland.  The room was very nice, the service great. The chef needs to let Calgarian's taste real Vietnamese flavours and not to be too timid in her approach to what could be a great menu."}
{"text":"Easily the worst Pho I've ever had. It's very aesthetically pleasing on in the inside but usually this is a tale where this place goes down in quality. The Pho tastes like PURE MSG and they are very stingy with the meat. It also lacks any flavor other than salt and MSG. With a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants this is the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've encountered. The owner is really nice which is why I couldn't give zero stars. It really saddens me as I really want to help out local Vietnamese businesses but this one broke my heart & my mission is to be honest when it comes to my reviews. Do better guys!"}
{"text":"Great New Location with Excellent Food. Pho An Vietnamese Cuisine used to be just down the street from this, their new location at 8989 Macleod Trail. When their 10-year lease ran out, they decided to find another location with more seats, and the ability to accept larger parties. They found exactly what they wanted just a little south of their old location. They were closed for over 4 months while they did the move and renovations.They now have twice the size, a bigger kitchen, and large parties are welcome.   Best of all, the food is as exceptional as ever! Linda and I went for a late lunch on Sunday, and I had my trusty #33, the better-than-great chicken based pho with fresh quality vegetables and BBQ seared chicken. Oh, it was so good. Everyone should try this at least once.   We have been going to their old location for many years, and now we will always go to their new, bigger restaurant as often as we can. It is awesome.  One more reason to love Calgary. You should go."}

{"text":"Came here because it was one of the few pho places open later. Would not come back, at least not for pho. Honestly one of the worst pho's we've had. We tried both chicken and beef pho and both broths tasted like pure msg + water. Prices are also a bit steep for how much you get."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant by far in Calgary! Been here a few times already and the service is simply amazing. This was complemented by the great food and good prices. The older gentleman serving us provided top notch service and never left us waiting. The little restaurant needs no advertising, it's that good. We dropped by in a hungering desperation and would have taken anything, but we were more than happily surprised by our results, now we drop by whenever we can. The quaint atmosphere and lack of crowded lines and seats made finding our favourite spot a breeze, and our conversation remained private. All in all, 15/10!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews we figured we would try them out, after getting home noticed that both the dishes were ice cold, the rice was the kind of rice you would get if you were to scrape out the remnants of the pot ( all sticking together and crusty ) we ordered a side of brocollii and cauliflower for an extra fee and received 2 stalks of each and the rest was shredded iceberg lettuce. Also the pork chop I ordered was cold and had hardened fat all over the bottom. I won't be returning to this restaurant anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fresh and delicious! The service is very good; friendly and quick without making you feel like they want you out fast!!  The decor is nice and with lots of different types of seating to choose from. My definite favorite!"}
{"text":"Due to its extremely close location to my house, I have become a repeat customer here at Pho An.  The dude who runs the place is super friendly, and the wait staff is also very nice.   I always order the beef vermicelli, and it is always delicious.  Good amount of beef, and spring rolls.   Their shrimp salad rolls are also very fresh and consistent.      Never had a bad experience here."}
