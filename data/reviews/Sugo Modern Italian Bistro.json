{"text":"Service was a little slow. I had the scampi pasta. $22 for 3 scallops and 3 shrimp on a bed of store bought angel hair pasta. Scallops were tasty, but expensive. I also ordered the fried risotto balls.  The risotto was not well seasoned, and was very bland. Our friend ordered the pork chop and it was so salty and weird tasting that it was in edible. I thought he was exaggerating so we all tried it and no one swallowed their piece!!  The sea is salty, but paled in comparison to this pork chop. We probably wont go back."}
{"text":"BE WARNED: No free refills on drinks. They refill the glass as much as you want but do not tell u that they will add it on as you got another drink. So we had one glass of iced tea marked as we got two. Went on a Tuesday night and was not busy. Seated the three of us at a small booth on the wall, which really should only sit two people. My fiance and I had to sit next to each other and were constantly elbowing the other. Service was okay however until check time, then they were quite rude about some gift certificates we had. The food is alright but very very greasy. We got lasagna and had to pour the large amount of grease out on the extra plate. It was disgusting. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. We will definitely not be back. Not worth the money. Also, because the food was so greasy, my fiancee and i had extremely upset stomachs the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Have dined here twice, most recently on July 2.  Food was typically excellent, but be forewarned:  we were informed after arriving that the bar menu will no longer be offered at dinner.  Having perused their website (there was no disclaimer on their site regarding new menu policy, and none is yet posted as of this writing) and deciding on a sandwich beforehand, I was greatly disappointed in being forced to choose from larger entrees I neither wanted or needed from the limited dinner menu.  After speaking with manager, I was told that new menus were being prepared, and that no one was certain as to whether or not a bar menu would be offered again at any point @ Sugo.

As mentioned above, remain confident in the quality of the food (excellent), but also be advised that your options have been limited."}
{"text":"This is one classy restaurant. I have recommended this place to friends without hesitation again and again. The Cioppino is the best I've ever had, and I have spent a lot of time tasting Cioppino in San Francisco, so that says a lot. I actually struggle to order anything else. The Spagetti & Meatballs are so good--scallop meatballs and black pasta with lemon and garlic--mmm. 

My husband has ordered the Braciole & Gnocchi and Flat-iron Espresso Steak and he quite enjoyed them. We tried the homemade tiramisu as well, and it was decadent. 

Jill was taking care of us last, and went out of her way to make us comfortable. She anticipated our every need.

Sugo has some amazing weekly deals. The best is for Tuesday: 2 entrees and a bottle of wine for $40. Seriously. You can't get a more affordable gourmet meal in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out because I had a gift certificate. We are so glad we did! We went on a Friday night and it there were a good amount of people there but not so crowded that we had to wait for a table. The restaurant decor is modern and they have a long bar.  I had a cucumber martini that was really good. We had the chicken wing confeit for an appetizer and it was fantastic. My dinner companion had the flat iron steak and I had a shrimp and pasta dish with a caprese salad. Everything was great and the presentation was beautiful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sugo was fantastically refreshing.  The level of culinary design that they put on a plate makes you feel like you were on the Food Network.  Well crafted dishes look like they are photo shoot ready. Their Cioppino; lobster, crab, mussels, shrimp and scallops in a nice and spicy tomato soup is quite possibly my second favorite tomato based seafood soup in the world!  Their Osso Bucco is deconstructed and is served as two small/main courses.  The first course will give you perma-grin because the roasted marrow presentation is a bit off-the-wall, but not in a bad way.  I am a salt guy so I had no problem with their dishes, but they might be a little salt happy on a few of their dishes.  All in all; loved the experience."}
{"text":"Not my fave.  Would much rather go to Chowder House, where the bang for the buck seems to be a little more affordable. The last time we were there, it was so noisy.  There was a trio sitting at the bar, yucking it up so loudly that we could not carry on a conversation.  It would be OK if I never went back."}
{"text":"Good food. I've only had lunch would love to try the great looking dinner menu."}
{"text":"Opening Weekend Review - same great food as chowder house with some service rough edges from being the new kid on the block.

We were hoping to get to try the family style menu concept that is to be one of the Sunday highlights, but it is only available for parties of 4 or more.  We are huge fans of the Chowder House and love the Sunday Brunch so only having a full dinner size ( and price) menu rather than the $12 per person option was a big deal... it would have been nice to have tried the garlic rolls or the caesar salad, but neither is available on the regular menu.

All of the food that we had was amazing!

Arancini con Ragu - crispy rice balls with tender short rib and chevre filling in a pool of spicy tomato sauce was a wonderful contrast of texture and flavor.

Pasta Fagioli - house made orichetti and sausage in a rich broth with some beans was HUGE!! There was no cup option and at only $6 the price was awesome... it was just Soooo much food to start.

Orichette - creamy gigande beans, bright tomatoes were the highlight with just a bit too much arugula and olive for me... the pasta was great and there was enough left over for 2 people to have leftovers.

Braciole - tender filet, light and \"fluffy\" sausage perfectly browned with delightful gnocchi and a wonderful tomato cream sauce... the highlight of the meat!

The coffee cups are small European models and the poor waiter seemed worried that I ran through a refill so fast... having lived in Seattle I'm used to my mid day Latte so this was more of a sip.

Total bill of $55 and enough leftovers for 2 lunches and 1 dinner was \"worth it\" but not something I would call Sunday Brunch.

They have already had a pre-opening wine dinner and plan to have them monthly so we will probably make this more of a special occasion place rather than a pre-game brunch spot.

There is a full bar with a television and they do take credit cards. No sign of a take out menu or mention of one on the website."}
{"text":"I came here for a few different reasons.  Firstly, my fellow Yelpers had great things to say!  Secondly, this is a local hotspot and I had to see what the interior design was like (hard to image from the outside that is would be so neat inside).

I wasn't blown away by the interiors, but it was clean, colorful and contemporary. I ordered the grilled cheese (see my photo) and was yummy!  Any sandwich with goat cheese is good with me!  It was more than I expected and the fries, quite frankly, kick ass!  They have truffle oil on them and are just amazing. I ate a handful of fries and half of my sandwich.  The left overs went to my vegetarian daughter.

The daily specials. In a nutshell, closed on Mondays.  Tuesday is a two-for deal.  Wednesday is retail wine night.  Thursday they have a jazz band (free mussels at the bar) and Friday night is $5 martinis.  

They will treat you well here!  

I can't wait to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time last night and really enjoyed our experience. The atmosphere is nothing special, but the food was really good.

The service was OK. It was a busy Saturday night, so it took a while for our waitress to appear, but fortunately the hostess filled our water and took our drink orders since the waitress was busy with another table. The one negative for our visit was the seating arrangement. We were put at a two-person table against the wall near the bar, and there was a larger table next to us, and the person's chair closest to our table left about a foot of open space. So the wait staff was constantly squeezing sideways between our table and the back of the person's chair, which was very annoying.

But the food more than made up for everything. We started with the Charcuterie for Two as an appetizer which was very good, though I wish the server had taken the time to explain what each item was, as most places typically do. For the main course, my wife had the Gnocchi which was good and quite a large serving. I had the Potato Crusted Cod which was cooked perfectly, and went very well with the red pepper herb fregola that it was served over. It also came with a little cup of white bean ragout which was delicious. I could have had that alone as my main course and been happy.

The service was good, despite it being busy. I also appreciated that the chef was making the rounds and came to our table to check that everything was good, which it was."}
{"text":"Food's a little expensive, the pasta was ok not great but the duck was really good. It was crispy on the outside of the skin and the inside was juicy and soft."}
{"text":"Not good. Had high hopes since we like the Chowder House. Aracini tasted like crispy fried nothing, had absolutely no seasoning. Calamari filling was tasty, but was overcooked. Gnocchi tasted like store bought stuff, sauce was good though. Pork chop was unedibly salty and shockingly off tasting. I really wanted to be adventerous and break out of our comfort zone of Russo's and Moe's, our two favorite restaurants in Cuyahoga Falls. $50 dollars wasted, dialing Russo's for a reservation for next weekend!"}
{"text":"Excellent value.  Pork belly appetizer, lasagna, and osso bucco were all delicious.  Presentation and preparation were like something you'd see on Food Network.  The band performing on the night we went was a little loud, but didn't interfere too much with conversation.  Worth another trip."}
