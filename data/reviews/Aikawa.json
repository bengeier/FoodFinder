{"text":"The best sushi I've tried so far! They look delicious, they smell delicious and they taste even more delicious! You can not live without trying their sushi..Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Sushi is great, fresh, atmosphere nice, a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I mentioned in my last review that I've had problems with my takeout orders in the past . I had some friends over last weekend and after a few drinks we were very hungry. I was delighted to find out that Aikawa delivers! We called and were told that the delivery fee would be $10.00. I wasn't pleased with this, but we figured what the hell (we are less than 10 minutes away by car). I mentioned to the person there that I had been having trouble with pick-up and asked that she please get my order correct this time, since we couldn't go back to fix it (we were in no condition to drive). Our food showed up almost an hour later and they got my order wrong...again. Instead of tofu teriyaki, they came with the tofu appetizer. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but it was the THIRD time that they've screwed up my order. I called back and was told that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do. The girl was very apologetic and nice and told me her manager would call me back on Tuesday (Monday was a holiday). I never received a call. Not pleased."}
{"text":"Nice selection of specialty rolls.  Fish is fresh, place is clean and the employees are very nice."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit. I came for dinner with my friend on the 28th. We made a reservation in case, but there was plenty of tables available. The overall service was very good, friendly staff. I really like the decor and paintings on the wall. You can even purchase them if you want. I like how there are tvs which display the food, it gives you a visual of what you are ordering. We each got a sushi platter which was a good amount of food. My platter were just 3 different makis including the chef specialty called Twister. I finished with tiramisu and vanilla ice cream for dessert. The staff was nice to wait until we finished, they did force us put even though they were about to close. The location is hidden and tucked away making it difficult for some to see when passing a by. My friend never knew it existed until she went on Yelp."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots to visit when I get back to Montreal. Their appetizers are phenomenally elaborate - and so, so tasty. 
Wait staff are really nice, and the service is great ... plus they usually have some really cool local art on the walls. I'd recommend their seaweed salad and just about all of their spicy rolls (and I'm not usually a spicy roll fan). Best part - the sushi is actually fresh."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good, but unfortunately, it is now mediocre, at best. Mediocre to the point that we feel we got robbed.

The rice is completely tasteless, the avocado and mango we had in our rolls were not even ripe, one roll literally had a fish stick wrapped in rice, when they say a roll has crab in it, it's fake crab.The fish was not very fresh. One roll tasted like it had been frozen, and another one I nicknamed the \"rice roll\" because that's pretty much all it was. It was so bad that my wife and I both wished we went to Sushi Shop or Kanda instead, which are both not great. For a more upscale sushi place, this is absolutely unacceptable.

We were so disappointed that we brought it up with the waitress who was very honest with us. She said that they got new chefs just 2 months ago. A 19 year old and a 23 year old who have absolutely no experience making sushi. She said they make the rice at the beginning of their shift which partly explains why it is so lousy. She admitted that they now get a lot of complaints about the quality of the food now. She seemed pretty fed up with the way the restaurant was now run and you can tell that she felt embarrassed about the whole experience they now offer.

Not only is the food absolutely horrible now, it's also extremely overpriced. We ended up paying $130 for our meal and we're still not feeling satisfied. We rarely have to spend that much money to feel stuffed. Even if the sushi was good, the value you get at Aikawa is really bad. ~30% overpriced.

Avoid at all cost. There are much better sushi places around there, including Tokyo (our favorite) and Maiko."}
{"text":"I discovered Aikawa several years ago when (I think) it was at the height of its success. The food was excellent no matter what you ordered - full of flavour and lightness, not to mention that their presentations were spectacular. Back then, Aikawa was owned by the same folk who owned the downtown Sho-Dan. I went back to Aikawa recently after a pretty long hiatus and was disappointed with my overall experience. Now, my waiter was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations and topping off my water frequently. But this is where the awesomeness ends. 

I ordered a variety of sushi and expected to savour unique flavours given my diverse selections; to play it safe, I also ordered some of my favorite specialty rolls because these had never disappointed me in the past.  Frankly, I was pretty unimpressed with my meal as a whole. It is not an exaggeration to say that every single one of my selections tasted exactly the same - bland. Nothing differentiated the different fishes from each other. Even rolls that were allegedly spicy had absolutely no bite to them. The waiter offered to 'spice up' my mayo (Really? They don't even make their own spicy concoctions?) but after two attempts, I told him to forget about it. After discussing the blandness of the food with the waiter, I found out that Aikawa had been sold (I'm not sure if Sho-Dan was also bought out). Ah, that explains everything. Given my disappointment, the waiter kindly offered us dessert on the house, for which we were grateful, but it did not impress and took about 30 minutes to get.

Aikawa is not cheap, and for the prices that they charge, I would expect superior quality which sadly, is not the case. For a similiar price, you will have a much better experience at Mikado in NDG, or even Maiko on Sources."}
{"text":"Much better than its neighbor in front. This establishment is your standard sushi restaurant with reasonable prices. Their food is very good and the atmosphere was relaxing. I would recommend this sushi rest."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Been here multiple times. Service is a little slow. The ambiance is a big miss, nearby competition is happening at night, not here. No music whatsoever, place is empty around 9.30-10pm... the food is good, I believe it's priced accordingly to the quality. Definitely a know spot in the area, but I'm sure they could solidify their offering a little more and get so much more results. Lots of potential to become even better."}
{"text":"I like to call the place the \"better: Sushi restaurant....you know the one behind Maiko sushi. Although it is \"better\" than Maiko, it is still only an OK sushi place. But in my humble opinion it is the best sushi I have experienced on the west island. But there's a lot of debate on which sushi resto is better. I recommend trying both Maiko and Aikawa  and seeing for your self. But I still think Aikawa is better. /end ramble"}
{"text":"I've tried Aikawa twice now, both times for lunch, once as a group of 6 at the restaurant itself and once for take out also for a group of 6 coworkers.

I really enjoyed it! Not the best (aka Maiko sushi) but really decent option if you're in DDO.

We got great service both times, in the restaurant and the waiter who delivered the food to us. 

I never actually paid but it doesn't seem too expensive. Wouldn't mind having their sushi again!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! I went here recently, and although the hostess was amazing (and really sold the crap out of the restaurant) the chefs/waiters were really off their game tonight. The busboys were great though (and that is all I can say about it).

The food is akin to Shogun (downtown Mtl), in terms of serving up fusion sushi. However, their waiter messed up my order and I had to wait over an 1hr and 1/2 for uncooked sushi rolls (which should take minimal time). THE RESTAURANT WAS ONLY HALF FULL! 

I had politely waited while the entire table received their meal and it seemed to the waiters that nothing was amiss. After waiting 30 minutes, I had to get up and ask a waiter to see where my meal was. He said, don't worry its coming, 2 minutes. 

I sat there (quietly fuming for another 30 minutes), and I had to ask again. I have to say it was quite embarrassing to wait while everyone at the table finished their meals. Needless to say, after arriving at the restaurant at 7pm and ordering by 7:30 PM, my meal arrived FINALLY at 8:45 PM. (THIS IS AN UNCOOKED MEAL, IT'S A MATTER OF ASSEMBLING AND CUTTING UP SOME RAW FISH) The sushi was terrible and the waiter refused to compensate me for my meal. They did however offer a free drink (after 1hr of waiting, at that point, I was too PO'd to accept).

Although their rolls were creative (an obvious knock-off of Shogun from Downtown), the quality was poor and the service was EXTREMELY POOR. For a $50, I could have easily gone to Maiko (3 storefronts away) and gotten better sushi and service. Or even BETTER, go downtown and get EVEN BETTER SUSHI."}
{"text":"Site of the first date with my love and I...very beautiful presentation for their food and very fresh. 
But...I know the chef left for Katoreya years back..and to be honest...the food and prices are better at Katoreya, as is the service. I gave it 4 stars because it is still very good and they have lowered their prices and have a table d'h√¥te that is a good deal. 

The environment is pretty, but far from intimate. I like that they showcase local artist's work to purchase. 

It was incredibly sweet for my boy to surprise me with this walk down memory lane..it is worth a visit, but my loyalty stays with Katoreya."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.

As soon as you walk in, your like \"damn, its a nice place\". 

However, the sushi is your typical fried fare and does not compare to rival \"Maiko\" directly across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my brother and was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the sushi platter for 3 (54 pieces) which was $60.  For me, I can eat endless amounts of sushi but find the AYCE places (Kanda) here to be low quality!!  Quality was quite good and presentation very nice.  One pet peeve is all of these new sushi places churn out sushi like robots but the presentation is missing!  One thing however is this place is a bit more on the expensive side but we're not in Vancouver or Toronto Toto!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sushi. I've also never tasted tempura as light as theirs. Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by this place! Wasn't expecting much frankly.  Aikawa has the same owners as Sho-Dan and offers more of a down-to-earth atmosphere while keeping the same quality in their sushis.  I went there for a take-out and was pleasantly greeted and served by their host.  She has been able to ask the kitchen to accommodate my requests without charging me extra and gave useful advices on how I should order while maximizing the amount of sushis I can get for the same price.  The sushis came in a high-quality circular take-out box and was presented very nicely.  The choices were creative and flavorful.  But i must admit that it was a little pricey as well but all worth it!"}
