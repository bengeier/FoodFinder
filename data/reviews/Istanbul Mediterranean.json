{"text":"This place is amazing. It was long time not to eat Turkish doner. The doner was perfect    With good price and the place is so clean"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty, plus great customer service. I waited like 15 min in the line and it was worth it. It's not that easy to find halal food in Vegas. Can't wait to go there again."}
{"text":"I resolved the issue with the owner and I was very happy because the owner understood and he apologize on behalf his worker and."}
{"text":"Loved it !!! Amazing food. I can eat this chicken swarma everyday. Really good food with reasonable price in Vegas. See u soon guys !!!"}
{"text":"It was the worst food i ever had and the moment i order the food i told that guy that plz make sure the chicken and beef should be juicy and what i get they invented a new way to make it juicy. They put extra sauces in the wrap and the chicken was dry and old and when i open my wrap we left the food as it is the food was dry old and rotten. Thanks for the worst food i ever had"}
{"text":"Great food, even at 4am.  The beef and lamb kebab fed my craving for decent food at that late hour.  Cost was under $10 too."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food. Recently stayed in Las Vegas and ate here twice(in one weekend). Sandwiches are very tasty and good size. Place is clean and food is fresh. Service is excellent.  If you need a good, inexpensive meal in Vegas try this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I don't eat carbs, so got a combo sandwich in a bowl...super good, great service, even @3AM it was simply awesome."}
{"text":"Great place for quick food in the strip. Their food delicious and all halal. We tried both chicken and beef gyro. Both were tasty, fresh and not dry. Prices are reasonable, and great customer service. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma I've had in Vegas!! I had the chicken and it was amazing. I can't wait to try the beef and lamb. If you're looking for a traditional Shawarma bursting with flavor, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The service is so slow - there were only two people on the line and it took the guy almost 10 minutes to prepare two small sandwiches.  I asked for a sandwich with no mustard and mayo, however, the guy generously topped it with mayo. I needed to argue and to ask him for another one. To be honest, he agreed immediately to prepare a brand new sandwich.  From outside the meat looks tasty because of the spitfire roaster. Actually, the food was more likely cold than warm. On the front, they claim with big words that here is \"The best Mediterranean food in town\". I have some doubts. However, the prices are fair even low for this part of the town."}
{"text":"The best Gyro place I've ever been to! \"    I went here with a friend. We are both fond of great food and gastronomic experience so we decided to visit Istambul Mediterranean restuurant in Las Vegas on the strip, at 4:35 AM the place was packed with customers the line was long  and My expectation was very high and I wasn't  disappointed at all. The food was amazing and the service impeccable. I  tried out the gyro lamb and beef combination, everything was fresh and delicious .  It is the sandwich  I won't forget for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"This is not a rating for the food, it's a rating for the  terrible experience I had with an employee. I have had bad experiences but have never left a bad review until now because I think somebody needs to deal with this employee. This just three hours ago. My husband and I stopped here to quickly grab food for our friends who had just gotten married. We called first to order, but the guy who answered said they don't take phone orders. We asked him to please make an exception but he said no. So we got there 3 min later and realized it was almost like a food cart (it made sense why they didn't accept call orders) and we got in line to place our order.   Our turn came super fast, but long story short the employee that we spoke with on the phone (and we know it was him because  while in line we mentioned that we called and he said he had answered) was really passive aggressive and rude. He didn't even speak to us, just waved with his hand and told us to stand right next to the line and he'll come help us. Then he proceeded to make food for two other groups. We were literally standing right in front of him so it's not like he forgot - he was purposely being rude as a way of demeaning us for the phone request, even though we weren't rude and didn't insist or anything. My husband had to say to him \"excuse me, I ordered ___\" before the guy grudgingly made our food. It was a really frustrating experience especially because what should have taken 5 minutes took way longer because this guy had no manners. He was the African or African American male, darker skin, with more grown out hair than the other employee.  Edit: the owner messaged me and fully apologized, said employees have been spoken to, and that he would give us a full refund. I really appreciate his kindness and I'm glad they responded and dealt with it. Changing to a four star!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I found the meat to be super salty though. Had to pick a lot of the meat out for that reason. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on Vegas strip , u will not be disappointed . Quality service and food.  For two chicken bowls it was 25$ which is very economical for the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"This is a best gyro shop in the town. I tried chicken gyro plate, my brother got meat gyro plate. Both of them were just great. This place will be now our regular place. They are open till 5 am on weekdays and 6 am on weekends."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Will definitely be visiting whenever in Las Vegas. Meat was delicious and juicy. Was staying at Bally's and ate here twice. People were kind and friendly. If you want to try authentic mediterranean food you should definitely visit this place."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want a quick bite.  The chicken bowl comes with rice salad and pita bread."}
{"text":"My regular place for nights! Open till 5 in the morning! Love the meat with the thatziki and hot sauce.   Coming back again"}
{"text":"The service is really great!!! We ordered a chicken bowl, the meat is really tender n alot ..."}
{"text":"Istanbul Mediterranean is definitely an added bonus along the famous Las Vegas Blvd Strip. It is located in Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops with flourishing eateries nearby. The eye-catching vertical rotisserie is similar to Greek gyros and Mexican Al pastor. The short menu makes it an ideal quick fix food to go, but seats are limited within the Bazaar Shops.  When there's a gyro on the menu, it's what I usually order. I came here for lunch and they weren't quite ready. I was told to come back in 15 minutes hoping to have the freshest meat on hand. I ordered the beef and lamb combination Turkish sandwich style. You have options for the type of veggies and two different types of sauces- white and red. Their toppings are unlike your Greek Gyro version such as having pickles on gyros which I opted out.   I was not too happy that the meat I was given was pre-sliced and overcooked. It was also hard and chewy. The seasoning and white sauce used were not as flavorful compared to what I am accustomed to with the Greek version. The beef and lamb with all the fixings still had a lot of wiggle room. The price of $9.95 with no sides included, I'll stick to my neighborhood shish kebab place for all the right reasons."}
{"text":"Not a doner, just a gyro and not that great of one.  The only thing doner like, is the lamb/beef meat, pretty decent meat, could use a little seasoning.  Other than that it is not a doner at all.  They advertise Turkish bread, crispy outside pillowy inside with a chew, do not have it, instead you get the bland gyro pita rounds.  The veggies were okay, except the turnips had no vinegar pop to them, nor did the pickles.  The tzatziki sauce lacked flavor and the red sauce lacked spice.  You want an amazing doner, do not go here, they don't even sell them, go to Berlin, amazing. If you want an overpriced, I understand they are on the strip, average gyro, come here."}
{"text":"two in the morning hunger kicks in! this place stays opens til 5:00 am.   the portions of meat on the gyro are huge so ask for extra sauce. we got the combo meat which is lamb, beef, and chicken. definetly taste good and was healthy."}
{"text":"If you're craving some Mediterranean food, Istanbul Mediterranean will definitely satisfy your craving!  Although it's just like a stand in a market area near Bally's, the food was ON POINT. I had a chicken pita and they stuff it so much that you definitely get a bang for your buck. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and they customize the toppings as per your request. Ask for extra spicy sauce if you can take the heat! They also have a bowl option where the toppings are put on top of rice for a few extra bucks.   Also, get a free bottled drink when you check in on yelp! I just went for a water bottle but that's the most satisfying on a hot day.  Although the service is a little slow, the food is delicious, relatively inexpensive, and satisfying. Can't go wrong! It also makes for some great drunk food lol."}
{"text":"A Mediterranean take away place.  Was very good and fresh, but not the best I have ever had.  A little slow in service. Line was longer than should have been.  One of the few places open at 11:45 pm weekday for a quick bite after a late show.  Price is reasonable, but not a bargain.  They are part of the ice cream store next door, so staff were running between places that made service slower than should have been."}
{"text":"If you in Vegas and if you hungry don't think go this butik delicious restaurant. Excellent portions, an efficient menu and a cool/casual atmosphere. This guys very nice and fast."}
{"text":"Great food go try it out if your on the Las Vegas strip.  Danny has great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Found this place while browsing in Las Vegas .... the food is awesome and very authentic!! A must try if you're by the Flamingo and Caesar Palace. The only reason I have 4 instead of 5 stars is that they don't have just beef by itself but beef with lamb."}
{"text":"Located in a nice outdoor shopping area, this place looked to be very authentic from the outside. The menu was reasonably priced and the meat rotating on the rotisserie looked great. I only wish I could've tried it fresh from the spit. Instead, after ordering the combo sandwich, the guy opens some warming drawer and pulls out the portion from there. The meat was dry, but at least you couldn't really tell because of all the sauce they doused it in. This made for a messy meal that was difficult to eat given the fact there were no tables anywhere. The sandwich was good and I would go back. But next time I'll ask for some fresh slices."}
{"text":"Great food, people were very friendly and fast. Made sure I got everything I needed and were very consistent. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And when you go ask for Samir he's really funny and welcoming."}
{"text":"If you need a quick bite to eat late at night this is a good spot. The chicken is really good & has good flavor. The beef and lamb was a little too gamey (sp?) for me... but over-all not bad a bad place for Vert-grilled meat."}
{"text":"Good halal food for the money,  especially right off the strip. I ate five meals here in three days"}
{"text":"Loved this street vendor on the strip. We picked up our combo bowls and walked over to picnic by the dancing fountains.. great food. Amazing quantity and fantastic taste..."}
{"text":"the best place to eat mediterranean and turkish foods, i highly recommended this place for shwerma lovers, especially the homemade hot sauce was so damn good"}
{"text":"Open up more places please! I'm a local and it kills me that I can't have easy access to this place!!! I want your gyros when I want them! Amazing! Beef and Lamb with red and white sauce!!"}
{"text":"Good size, meat was a bit dry I think. I've never had a pita with the toppings they have here and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  If we can give them more than 5 stars we would.  I've eaten at many strip restaurants and this is just as good and way cheaper!    We \"stumbled\" upon this place at 4 am as we literally followed the smells and group of people.   The quality of the gyro meats was fantastic.  They toast their pita bread which adds to the flavor.  Then they pile on the pickled cabbage, onions, hot sauce, Lettuce, etc.  it's an explosion in your mouth - in a good way!  We went back the next day on our way out of town to have another sandwich for the drive back to Cali.    The service was great also, usually Vegas dive joints aren't too pleasant to late night customers as they're feeding the drunk masses, but these guys were patient and nice.    My boyfriend and I aren't fans of Vegas but we'd come back just for their gyros!  We don't have evidence of our food we ate it too fast and didn't want to stop to take a pic."}
{"text":"Omg. 10/10. I've had gyros in NYC but this is worth it and is better than momofuku and probably is better than Ramsy burger. Juicy, meat is flavorful, just on point. I usually don't eat that much as a small girl but I felt like I could eat another one. Will be back for lunch"}
{"text":"Horrible food quality do not go, it's v accessible being right on the street but I would question the quality of food not tasty at all"}
{"text":"This place is so tempting from seeing it, and one bite game over sooo good! Turkish delight. :)  This is at the Grand Bazaar Shops outside in front of Bally's so convenient when near the center of The Strip! They offer a free drink with your check-in so take advantage of that if you're thirsty, might as well. They have wonderful service and the food was delicious. Their *Beef and Lamb Bowl* is priced right and plentiful!! This comes with veggies, rice, and pita bread. The bread was light and fluffy and the sauces were amazing and complimented the appetizing meats.~"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Doner/Sharwma place I have eaten. Both the chicken and Beef/Lamb were delicious. The Sandwich is enough for 2-people to share and Rice plate is enough for 3-people to eat and share although the rice did taste a bit dry and could use a bit flavor. Needless to say, I highly recommend this place if you eat only Halal and this place is open 10 AM - 5 AM so if you have late night craving and need a heavy meal to satisfy your taste then this is the place to be. I do plan on coming here again when I am in Vegas with family and friends. Also, I do not understand the number of rating. The line is a bit long compare to other eateries around the vicinity so it should get more reviews."}
{"text":"Great food in this hole in a wall place. They are open really late on weekends. The chicken doner plate was good but the falafel could be better. Expect long lines most of the times"}
{"text":"Just to clarify this is in the Grand Bazaar outside of Bally's, it is not inside Bally's. Food was pretty good for a quick bite. $13 for a bowl which is kinda pricey for fast food. Otherwise it was quick and yummy. I wouldn't consider it Turkish though.."}
{"text":"Delicious food if you happen to be on strip. This is the place If you like a quick casual lunch or dinner.  Their gyro kebab and salad is just healthy and yummy!  Don't miss it if you are looking for delicious food with reasonable price in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Istanbul Mediterranean? It's open until 5 am. And the food does not disappoint. We arrived in Las Vegas at 1:30 am and did not finish checking in until 3:30 am. Rather than eating at the Johnny Rockets at our hotel, we chose to find some good food. So glad we came across this on Yelp.   I haven't had real good shawarma since my days living in Manila so it was a pleasant surprise to have shawarma that brought me back to those good old days. I had a bowl that consisted of beef and lamb, white rice and veggies. Istanbul Mediterranean is extremely generous when it comes to the portion of meat they give. For $11, it is definitely worth it. I had the white sauce and it was on point.   I loved this place and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Homemade Turkish! Both the chicken and beef shawarma were delish. Their falafels are yum too. Their tzaziki is also to die for. The babaganoush and hummus are delicious. Service is great. Their prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"This was one of the best to go Mediterranean food I have eaten. Meat was good Tender and nice - rice were really up to point.  -one  of the place to must visit when I am in Vegas.  I really recommend this place to all the Indians and asians who want to call rice and roti as food - go for it.  I am a meat lover so go with combo (beaf lamb and chicken ) bowl.  Keep it in guys."}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to a european style doner kebab in Las Vegas. The meat needs to be shaved thinner and they need to serve it in the bread. Most likely you'd have to import the water from Europe for the bread to be on point. Other than that this is the best knockoff I've found in my search for a doner in Vegas."}
{"text":"Average food. Accessible and fast. They use white rice which isn't the best choice. The roll is much better"}
{"text":"Chicken bowl.  It's sliced chicken not cut.  Plain white rice.  Sliced tomato and onion.  Then some pickle slices.  12$  At least it was open late and fast.  Price C Food D Service A"}
{"text":"This is the go-to spot whenever I'm staying at a nearby hotel like Bally's or Flamingo.  Open til 5 AM, you're going to get your appetite satisfied with their delicious gyros.  The flavors are so good, they might even measure up closely to some of the better NYC food carts.    My choice is aways the chicken and lamb combo.  You get a hefty portion of both meats, a good portion of rice, and a whole plethora of veggies/condiments.   Their white sauce might not beat the original Halal Guy's white \"crack\" sauce, but it gets the job done.   And unlike the Halal guys \"burning hot, so hot you might die\" hot sauce, Istanbul's hot sauce is actually reasonably hot without detracting from the flavor.  I started ordering one bowl at a time on our staycations on the Strip, but when my wife started finishing up my bowl, we now order our own.   It's plenty of food but it's hard to put down once you start.  Definitely a great and cheap option when trying to locate food on the Strip."}
{"text":"This hidden gem was where the locals were lined up at 12:30 a.m. They even gave us hints as to what to order. Actually everything is good they said. We had a bowl and a sandwich. Delicious and fast- not to mention good customer interactions. Felt like they were happy to have us. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Every time I'm in Vegas this is my first stop.  Great flavor, always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef and lamb gyro. The meat was super tough and/or a bit chewy. The meat was definitely OFF. Didn't have that taste that Mediterranean food usually has either. It came with option of pickles, onions, picked cabbage and red or white sauce. I got rec sauce which was so watery it made my pita bread fall apart.   I ordered fries and it was given to someone else. I was given a refund and a free water so wasn't the worse although I couldn't really eat the gyro so I was hungry."}
{"text":"The place is dirty as heal. Food is not tasty, specially the beef seasoning.   I can't believe this place stays open."}
{"text":"Very yummy - Beef halal. Good music play and enjoyed every bite. Checked in and got a free Dr Pepper."}
{"text":"I like the food quality and the prices are excellent. Halal food in the middle of Las Vegas Strip was like a dream for me.!! Be careful for the waiting line, try to order first over the phone or online and go for pickup"}
{"text":"Where to even begin with this review...?  It's been over two months since I've had the pleasure of feasting upon their beef and lamb \"sandwich\" (gyro, doner, whatever you want to call it). Not only did they load it with shredded lettuce, a mountain of thinly sliced red onions, diced tomatoes, pickles, pickled red cabbage, and a mountain of steaming meat; they then put tzatziki, TAHINI SAUCE, and some red chili sauce on top of that. I think I shed a tear in line.  My first bite into this thing was one of the best first bites of anything I've ever eaten. The sauces mixing perfectly with the warm, salty, meat. The crisp veggies offering a satisfying crunch and fresh flavor. I think it took me twenty seconds to eat, and they were probably the best twenty seconds of my life. I walked away from Bally's with a sense of sadness and, despite being very full, a feeling of emptiness. Would a meal ever be that satisfying again? Is that spinning meat cone the true meaning of life?   Many questions are left unanswered, but what I do know is that I am never moving away from Vegas so long as Instanbul Mediterranean is open. I feel truly blessed to live within driving distance of this place. All exaggeration and jokes aside, you will not be disappointed if you eat here."}
{"text":"Food was way too old, cold, beef was hard to chew and not fresh. For such price the food was expensive. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I am a local in Vegas and I wanted to check the new shops in front of Bally's. I seen people waiting in the line so I gave them a try!   Meat/chicken: I got the combo sandwich, it was good nicely marinated, flavorful.   Pita was warm and soft. I liked it so far! And the guys told me they open till 5am weekdays, 6am on the weekends which is good.   The only minus is they do not have a place to sit! So I need to grab ur food and eat in the middle!"}
{"text":"Tried the falafel sandwich - so good  A little dry but delicious!!!!! You can get extra sauce and it'll be awesome  The fries were alright and too expensive but then again .. can't blame them considering the location  Just wish they made a real doner with the right bread like they do back in turkey on the streets  Regardless delicious food!! Will def go back :)"}
{"text":"We saw a huge line last time and decided to come try the hyped gyros. I ordered the plate and it was decent. The meat was very tender, but slightly on the dry side. Got a few pieces of lettuce and three slices of tomatoes and three pickles. Not sure if that's standard, but I have definitely had more generous portions of vegetables and tastier sauces from other Mediterranean places."}
{"text":"Omg!!! The food is divine!!! Not to mention the great customer service !!! Thank you !"}
{"text":"I stopped by here once and I like it very much. The food is tender and delicious. Try to mix tzatziki and spicy sauce. Bowl is the best."}
{"text":"Such a bomb gyro place in the marketplace near ballys. This place is slightly hidden in the last alley behind Ben & Jerry's. It's great for a quick bite anytime of day or night. I get their combo sandwich which includes beef, pork and chicken and they put a very very generous amount of meat in it. Word of caution, if you are not used to it they put pickles and red cabbage if you ask them to put everything. So if you are not into that then make sure to ask them to exclude it."}
{"text":"This place the best in town if you visit Las Vegas  It's a must and with good price too  Every time I been here I eat at this place"}
{"text":"Amazing Gyros!! So much meat and flavor! Owner was such a nice guy and very helpful. We will be coming back for lunch! I highly recommend eating here. We liked it better then most of the restaurants we have eaten at since we have been here."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town hands down, great customer service, and great prices. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I ordered the combo bowl and chicken sandwich to share. They don't have tables out front but there are benches nearby and you can eat in the sun or shade. They measure out a generous portion of the meat so what you see in pictures is what you end up getting. Both chicken and beef+lamb were very flavorful and the sauce was the perfect compliment. In the bowl, the rice is nice and buttery. It was just under $24 for a really satisfying, perfectly portioned lunch. I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I've seen a line at this place before and have been meaning to try this place. My kids however don't like mediterranean....YET so it isn't always our first pick when trying out new spots. This particular day however...my kids are tired and don't even want to head out to roam about any more. They are Vegas out and just want to stay in the room for dinner. So my husband left to get them pasta from sbarro downstairs...and given we get to have a choice now, since we're at Bally's..this was the perfect time to try this!   My husband had the lamb sandwich while I ordered the Chicken sandwich. Mine was a tad bit on the heavy side but the flavors were pretty packed and juicy. I can't really say too much about the lamb sandwich but lets just say...he killed it in just a few bites. They were pretty big and really filling. I'm actually a bit surprised at the quality in the pita and the meat. I would recommend this place to anyone who's down for Mediterranean food on the strip.   Yelp Review 2017 Challenge 69/100"}
{"text":"The best beef gyro sandwich I have had in the city. I have at least 2 of them a week. The Shawarma sandwich is good also. Next time, we will try Maras ice cream. The price is right and the service is great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Not lot of options, was looking for falafel. Nice food, rice and chicken had flavors. Budget friendly right on the strip. Served with smile."}
{"text":"Love from Phoenix. We were roaming around the strip at 1 am and were hungry so decided to try out this small vendors. We had chicken sandwich with all the veggies and it was sooo amazing. The shop is too small and there are only a few staffs and you will probably have to wait in a long line but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first but after reading some reviews I decided to give them a shot and I'm glad I did.  The price is kind of high but for being on the strip and for being better than any other place in town I've found, it's worth it.  I got the beef and lamb sandwich and it was delicious. Wasn't aware it came with pickles though which was the only thing I didn't enjoy.  Don't get me wrong, I like pickles, just not on that.    I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for beef gyro, highly recommend this place. Service is faster than other placees near by.  Thank you guys you are doing best beef gyro in the Las Vegas . Strongly will visit agin Istanbul Mediterranean Gyro"}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick bite, but the portion is too small for the price even for the strip."}
{"text":"It was best experience since I move to USA from Europe. I miss this taste. Thank you guys it was delicious ;-)"}
{"text":"nice people  but honestly the worst gyro ive ever had. first its the only one ive ever had w pickles and pickled red cabbage! so idk i thought that was super strange... but maybe i just haven't had this \"regional\"? style????  the meat was very thin and dry, tasted like store bought pita, which ws okay nothing special, hummus was ok, fries were fries also they use styrofoam lets stop contributing to he landfills, theres so many better options, they were already covered in foil, i don't understand the extra package and plastic bags  we were disappointed... idk if its cuz were from seattle and we have lots of great places but id def not recommend this and wont go back, was a waste of money and only went here because of the reviews"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a tasty, quick meal on the strip, try this place! The lamb kabob is great! Ask for the hot sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in Vegas! Love the combo sandwich as well. The place is always busy and the line does get long, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious! Combination of beef & lamb in a rice bowl with hot sauce. They do the meat right! I couldn't put my fork down or even have a conversation with anyone around me.  Looking forward to their food truck!!! Staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Istanbul mediterranean restaurant is the Best Turkish 'Döner gyro' food in Lasvegas which has great, delicious meat and special traditional Turkish bread with special sauces :)  After than you should eat the famous and delicious 'Marash' turkish ice cream like gelato Also serving is friendly and funny :)"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite gyro place in Vegas. It's fresh and daily prepared. The staff is so nice and friendly and if you check in they offer you a free drink."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Wasn't hot, but just warm. It's basically fast food but the price was kinda high for street food... Same food in Los Angeles is about $3 less.  It was super cold and windy outside and there was no heated place to sit that wasn't in the freezing 35 degree wind, it is too cold to enjoy a not so hot meal.  However the guy was generous with the portions. So if your super hungry it's a plus."}
{"text":"Living in Hawaii where there's little to no Mediterranean/Turkish restaurants, this was the closest I could get to good Turkish food. I ordered the doner sandwich with chicken and it was amazing. Glad I got to try something different"}
{"text":"This hit the spot! Great customer service, icecream was so delicious without being overly sweet! We both got the combo with extra vegs and icecream for about  $30! We were so hungry, the overly priced and long lined buffets at Belligio etc were so unappealing, we were in line for less than 5 minutes and we were just too happy to eat the yummiest and freshest gyro in years! Would be back here in a heart beat when/if we return to Vegas"}
{"text":"If you're looking for real halal gyro and Turkish Doner in the middle of the desert, this is the place to be!  I ordered chicken and lamb/beef gyros with everything on it. Everything meant gyro came with delicious meat wrapped in warm pita, garnished with tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce. I also order Falafel for a side dish. Both chicken and beef/lamb meats were tender and had lots of flavors. The pita was warm and soft. The vegetables were fresh. The sauce was perfect! The portion was big and really filling.  The place is small and more suitable for a quick bite or takeout. The staff is incredibly friendly and will answer your questions when you have them. Quick service and affordable prices.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a perfect location in the strip. The staff were very nice. The chicken and meat is halal in this place.   I had tried the meat shawarma and was excellent and delicious. They put too much meat into the sandwich. The sauces are good here. Always have the mayo and ketchup sauce mixed when having a shawarma.  The only thing I didn't is that I asked to have fires inside the sandwich and they had charged me as a bowl of fries. I go to couple Arabic and Halal restaurants and they do not charge me on that.  The prices are okay. Would go again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and i would definitely keep coming back here.. My favorite is the sandwich beef and lamb also the price is right.  i would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We were walking for over 2 hours and foods places we been wasnt good. Than we meet this hole in a wall place. Really good food and really good customer service. Most important, its halah. Would come back again when i visit las vegas."}

{"text":"Hey guys, if you looking for quick food here is the place!! I been around the world, and here they made me best kebab ever!! Either chicken or lamb. The best ! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Oh my God! This place is just awesome! The location was perfect, the service was fast, and the food was excellent! I highly recommend this place to anyone traveling through Vegas or any locals that love trying new food!"}
{"text":"Really good food really good costumer service highly recommended!!! Especially if you're manches;)"}
{"text":"Good but they didn't have the beef/lamb when they opened so hard to tell with just chicken.  They said it wouldn't be ready for an hour.  Why do you offer it if it's not ready when you open.....I waited in line for 10 min only to find out when I got to the front. Not sure if it's just a matter of their workers getting in early enough to get it going."}
{"text":"The beef lamb Gyro is very flavorful just slightly greasy...but definitely not dry.  The pickled onion, lettuce, tomato and slices of pickles give enough vegetables to complete the whole sandwich meal. Come hungry when you order this sandwich. The staff is friendly and works hard to get your order perfect. It's a great place."}
{"text":"I have to say the best Shawarma I've had in Vegas!  Recommend highly, especially the lamb and beef sandwich with the white sauce was very good!"}
{"text":"Great quick bite as you walk in to Bally's from the strip. I little hidden, it is under the big Bally's sign"}
{"text":"Great little stand under the big Bally's sign behind Ben & Jeri's. Great taste for price. Had the lamb/beef plate with all veg.  Had white sauce and garlic sauce then topped with hot sauce...like sambal. It had a lot of meat and rice. (Rice was  little dry, not fluffy) but still a great deal.   4-value for price 1- ambiance.  Stand only. No seating. Some outside tables to use.  4-taste, except rice  I'll be back for the quick to go meal. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice guys working here! The gyro had great flavor and the white sauce is good. My only complaint was that the lamb and beef meat was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Came by around 10:45AM for an early quick lunch. Ordered the combo sandwich, which was fine. The pita bread was delicious and warm but the meat (chicken and beef/lamb) was a bit on the dry side. Ordered every single garnish - tomatoes, onions, cabbage, lettuce. It was a bit overly drenched in tzatziki and chill sauce but I did ask the server to make it as he would recommend or eat it. Fine for a quick bite at $9.95."}
{"text":"SUPERB taste and quality! Visited twice during our trip. Had the gyro bowl and it was AMAZING. Half chicken half gyro, rice, onion, cucumber sauce, special hot sauce, other garnishes. Just damn good! Comes with the freshest pita I have ever tasted. Can get your bowl with lettuce, but lettuce we honest, we ain't here for the veggies!"}
{"text":"They have awesome food, quick and good service. Everybody is so frendly and smiling face. Also this place has halal food, its only halal food place on the strip. Cant wait eat there again. Ooo dont forget to get your traditional turkish  ice cream.  Mmm yummy combination....."}
{"text":"Halal food on the Las Vegas strip sounds like an oxymoron. But there it is and proudly on display. I had their doner sandwich twice. The first time they had some meat already prepared. The second they cut it fresh from the spit. Oddly enough the already prepared meat was nicer but not by a lot. It just had this crispiness I really enjoyed. The meat is nicely salty, juicy, fatty, flavorful, and satisfying. I normally don't order chicken doner but it looked good and also didn't disappoint. They heat up their bread so it's soft yet chewy. Their white sauce is also very good. More on the herbal tzatziki side than the more vinegary halal guys version. So great halal food with easy access on the strip and open late. What more could you want."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. I ate here yesterday with my husband  and we had a bowl and a sandwich, both of which were combo meat. The meat tasted like it was rubber, absolutely disgusting and was extremely salty. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Donër sandwiches.  If you want them. This is the place that comes the closest.  The meat (beef lamb) was slightly on the dry side.  Seasonings, sauces, heat, were just right.  The pickled veggies hit the spot!  I want more!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in the US! Impressive flavor... almost like being in Athens, Greece. Just amazing!!! The \"white\" sauce is incredible tasty. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For those comparing this place to Halal Brothers.  Relax.  This is such basic food.  The extra crispness you taste on your meat is burnt.  I got the combo plate and every bite was like swallowing chards of glass.  It was dry, the sauce masked the non -seasoned tastes of the meats, the rice tasted like it was cooked in a vat of butter.  Very pedestrian,  very uninspired,  cannot believe all the rave reviews they've gotten but please, if you are ever in NYC, try The Halal brothers on the corner of 53rd and 6th diagonal, i repeat, diagonal from the Hilton hotel.  Stand in land and thank me later.  Istanbul...get it together!"}
{"text":"Located down stairs from Bally's Hotel.  The food is flavorful!  Don't skip out on this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and very affordable.  Make sure to try the ice cream next door too. They have fast service and they are very nice and friendly.  When I come back to Vegas I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Oh my this place was tasty. I had a beef n lamb sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was just the right size to share with my hubby. Though I think I could have finished it on my own. The meat was tender and I was really enjoying the veggies. The white sauce made this sandwich. The price was a little more than what I wanted to pay, but for this place being on the strip its a good price. Will be stopping by before the rush of people. The line got pretty long at about 5pm on sunday when we went. This place is located in the Grand Bazaar outisde of the Bailys hotel and casino in the front near Las Vegas Blvd. You can valet, but we parked in the back of the hotel. Needed the walk after all the grubbing"}
{"text":"I ordered combo with bowls. it's  good.it has delicious meat and a lot of veggies includes tomato,onion,pickle. u can get drink and icecream. It'a a pitty that business hours are short."}
{"text":"What a nice place in Las Vegas. I was looking a gyro place to be opened exactly like this one for a long time. I often go to Vegas for shows. The owners are very friendly, the gyro is is so delicious. I will be your regular customer whenever I am there. The best gyro in the town. The next door Ice Cream shop is also authentic. I like sticky ice cream."}
{"text":"Wow!! Who knew that one of the best falafels would be found in this walk up, no seating food place in the strip mall kind of place? They were fast and super friendly while making my sandwich. Definitely get all of the sauces-they add so much flavor. They have a variety of toppings for any of the sandwiches of bowls. I got them all- lettuce, red cabbage, pickles, tomatoes and red onions. My sandwich was plenty substantial for the $10 price tag. Not many places to get a meal of that size for that price tag on the Vegas strip. I wish that I had tried the baba ganoosh or even the hummus but I know where I will be going next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came to this place months ago!!   And I'll be back on Wednesday!!   It's a walk to get to it when your a local lol.   But the shawarmas tho!! Fire!!!   Tahini sauce pickled onions tomatoes Harrisa.   What's not to like!!   Right of the spit and fresh as can be."}
{"text":"Looks good but the taste not so much. Meat was extremely dry and what they call hot sauce is the Asian chili pepper sauce. Next time I'll go to the ramen next door."}
{"text":"Horrible overpriced food! The chicken was dry to the point where I had to throw my shawarma away, the rice was soggy and none of the food was fresh. The gyro had an awful smell to it which made me want to puke. I went there on a Thursday afternoon and it seemed like they were serving leftovers from the day (possibly even week) before. Won't be returning and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We stopped by here to grab some quick food while we were walking in Las Vegas. We tried falafel and shawarma. Both were tasty and delicious. Good customer service and all foods here are HALAL. Prices are reasonable. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me and my bf came here and we were happily surprised! The quality and portions of the food was great and hearty! I got the chicken bowl that came with veggies like tomatoes, lettuce, onions, radish, and you can choose pickles if you want. It came with a warm pita bread, rice, and, white sauce. My bf got the lamb and beef sandwich which came with the same except the rice. Super yummy we came back twice during our stay :)"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. Average flavors, beef & lamb meet was dry and rubbery. I ate it, because I was hungry but will not be back or recommend to a friend."}
