{"text":"Tried twice both times food was above expectations. Pasta, pizza, craft beer, unique decor, some sidewalk seating. Fantastic"}
{"text":"Great pizza...and I am from NY...This pizza was some of the best I have ever tasted. We had the anchovies Neapolitan and the pollo plaza. Both were fantastic. The pollo had a fresh cream on it like sour cream but not sour (creme fresh)...delicious with cilantro on top. Well done."}
{"text":"This place is really clean and friendly and the ingredient are always wholesome, fresh, and full of flavour. I live in the Old Port, and this is my go-to pizza joint."}
{"text":"Nice spot off the beaten path. Wife and I had antipasto salad and split a pizza with sauce, goat cheese, and basil. Kids split pepperoni pizza. Everyone was happy."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. That's all you need to know. During my stay in montreal, I ate here a few times. I had the Caesar salad, the green salad, bruschetta, spaghetti pomodoro and the pizza disperata. ALL were delicious.  
Don't forget to leave room for tiramisu. Seriously. 
And some coffee."}
{"text":"Really good mid to upscale pizza place. Good with kids, at least early in the evening. We went with our two children at 6pm and the place was almost empty. Staff were friendly and helpful.

We had marinated artichokes and a terrine of zuccini, chorizo, and calamari for starters. Both very tasty. Neither were huge but that was fine since we had pizzas coming next. The pizzas were perfectly done, thin crust european style, each about 12-14 inches. The pear, gorgonzola and walnuts was flavorful without being too cheesy. The prosciutto and olives also just right. And the two kids shared a perfectly crispy Margharita simple one.

Desserts were sorbet for the kids and a chocolate tarte for the grownups. All in all quite good. The house red wine was a Montepulciano and quite good as well.

Overall atmosphere was hip, sophisticated, but not stuffy and no attitude. Prices weren't the cheapest, but you're getting a very nice relaxed evening out with great food in an unrushed ambience. As New Yorkers we know pizza and restaurants and this is up with the best."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, lovely terrace (nice and quiet), pleasant service. Great spot :)"}
{"text":"I had the Charchutiere Pizza which was exactly what I needed. Thin crust, 4 kinds of meat and lots of cheese. I also had a small salad which was not small at all. Service was great and very nice inside, they have outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly out. I strongly recommend, super delicious, great service and moderately priced."}
{"text":"Lorsque je pense pizza je pense à pizzaiole 
Très bonnes pizzas au four à bois je la recommande fortement j'y suis client depuis les années où ils étaient sur la rue crescent étant moi même ancien restaurateur je peux dire qu'ils sont constants en cuisine et en service 
Bravo !"}
{"text":"This place was yummy! I got their special which was a salmon pizza with capers and we also got a calzone with all different kinds of meat inside. And a Caesar salad w/ anchovies. All the food we ordered was very good and the service was spot on! The place has a industrial vibe but it looked cool. Will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"Food 3/5 decor 4/5 staff&service 3/5
Located in old montreal, steps away for the old port. Two of us went for lunch on their spacious terasse on a sunny day. All the pizzas are one size, about 10 inches. The food was good but the service could have been better, I would order and ask questions in english but the waiter stuck to answering in french. 
1. Fornarina pizza - parmessan cheese, garlic oil, and mushrooms (12$)
2. Margharita pizza - mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, and basil (11$)
3. Green sala as apetizer - romaine lettuce, iceberg lettuce, and tomatoes (6$)

For the two of us, with taxes and tip, our bill was 38$."}
{"text":"Very great service, nice location, walking distance from my place, I ordered the Pizza Carciofo and was enough for 2, price reasonable, pizza are slim(good for me) after that I was good for walk to the old port"}
{"text":"The food is either awesome or very mediocre, its a bit of a luck of the draw as to which cook is handling your food. Even that has changed dramatically since they've recently significantly reduced their menu. The worst part of coming here really is the awful service. No matter what location you'll go to, you'll be dealt with profound disinterest and any complaint you may make in person or attempts to contact them will be ignored. There are better places to go to where you'll receive better food and better service that are easier to reach."}
{"text":"Cute pizza spot in old Montreal. Pizza, appetizers are fantastic. I had pasta with meat sauce, good portion and very tasty. My husband had a pizza, cooked perfectly and tasted great. We've been here a number of times and its consistently good and never had a bad meal. Very good prices especially for old port area. Bonus is the pretty terrasse in the summer. This place is one of my go to spots to satisfy a pizza craving!"}
{"text":"Margherita pizza with garlic was soooooo good. U want a satisfying pizza date come here. Amazing food good service and close to the old Port...  What more could u want?"}
{"text":"Nice little place, the patio was awesome in nice weather. Like another reviewer, I had the Pizza Charcuterie. It was good but nothing terribly special; nice to have 4 different meats on the 4 slices, so it was almost like having different pizzas. They had an interesting take on cheesecake: not thick and dense like some nor scimpy and light like others, but a really smooth, creamy texture similar to rice pudding. On top of a really nice, strongly flavoured graham cracker crust, it was very tasty.

I didn't catch her name, but the waitress was excellent: very nice and warm and a great sense of humour."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful pizza! Let's get started, shall we?

The food:
I've only been there once so I cannot give a complete review of their food, but their pizza is just delicious. Perfectly cooked, thin crust with lots of seasoning and flavour, wonderful. Definitely will return to try out more dishes.
The pizzas are slightly pricey, but definitely worth every penny.

The service & environment:
Very efficient service, food came out pretty fast, and the waiter constantly refills my water while asking us how was the food. I absolutely fell in love with the interior decor; the ambience is just amazing and the views outside the windows at night are just astounding.
The restaurant is very tidy, and the dim lighting creates a great romantic environment for couples to go."}
{"text":"So, Montreal was absolutely freezing while we were here. We live in Boston so it's not the concept of winter that we struggle with. I guess it was part of the unusually cold winter we're having in 2013/2014. (Remember: climate change is a figment of all of our imaginations!)

Anywho, getting suited up to go eat was exhausting in itself which meant that we had to find someplace very close and not in the 3-4 dollar sign range that seems usual in this area. I am not a huge pizza fan (I know: what kind of American am I?), but I did enjoy my apple and cheese pizza here. The thin crust is good and the flavors were all excellent (although apple is hard to taste when paired with tomato sauce). 

It was deserted when we went on a Monday night (is *everything* in Montreal shut on Mondays or what?) and our waiter was very nice and attentive. The prices are excellent and our bruschetta appetizer was also tasty.

I also really liked the interior decor."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner! Pizza is so delicious! Staff is very friendly, prices are affordable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service et nourriture corrects mais j'ai été déçue et fâchée de voir une serveuse s'en préfère aux parents d'un jeune enfant un peu turbulent...
La nourriture y est toujours bonne et le service est bien, particulièrement la pizza cuite au four."}
{"text":"Wonderful refuge on a cold rainy day in Old Montreal.  Cesar salad was fabulous without being overly generous.  Margarita pizza with prosciutto was among the best we've had.  Server was professional and attentive."}
{"text":"We went there as a party of 3. First of all, the restaurant's design is beautiful and slightly on the futuristic side. My friend got the carbonara pasta and she found it very good, meaning: well spiced, that the pancetta was fabulous (just typed the terms she told me!), not too saucy but at the same time creamy and rich in flavour. My boyfriend got the pesto pasta. It was very simple, there was a good quantity of pesto and the flavour was good, but he would have liked to see more veggies in the dish (the simplicity of the dish was perhaps too simple this time). I liked my pomidoro veggie pasta, but I know I tried more traditional flavours in other restaurants. Their pomidoro sauce was good, but I didn't enjoy how the peppers made the dish taste sweeter. Finally, the tiramisu was super fresh and delicious! It came in a glass and it was  unctuous, light and creamy; all at the same time. The cookie inside had well absorbed coffee and cream. De-li-cious! I've been looking for a good Tiramisu and this one made the cut! Their wine and beer selection was good too."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, and good service!! Not a huge place, but has great ambiance!! We got the pasta carbonara and marguerita pizza both were delicious! Not bad on the price either!"}
{"text":"Depuis des années je voulais essayer ce resto au style Diner des années 50. Eh bien, je suis enfin aller! Ça faisait une éternité que ça m'avait pris une éternité choisir dans le menu. Je voulais tout goûter. Mes amis et moi, avons chacun pris une entrée. J'ai donc pu goûter aux entrée de saucisses italiennes, boulettes de viande et le ravioli. Les 3, délicieux, mais prochaine fois, je prendrai les boulettes! Ma soeur et son amie ont pris la salade Pizzaiole. Délicieuse aussi.

La carte de vin est très bien et les prix sont très correct pour un resto. J'ai pris la pizza qui avait des saucisses italiennes. C'est une grosse portion de pizza pour une personne. Mais vous pouvez l'emporter chez vous! 

J'ai adoré le service de la serveuse. Elle était toujours attentive, pas pressé qu'on commande et nous servait le vin. Bref, un endroit à retourner, entre amis, en couple ou même en solitaire!"}
{"text":"I love great pizza....and this little restaurant in an old renovated train station did not disappoint me!  Late night working at the new job, walking the city after 7 pm looking for something to take the chill off, but not wanting a fancy schmancy restaurant Pizzaiolle was a gem to stumble upon.

A split of Chianti began the evening.  Starter was a well dressed Caesar salad with fresh croutons and obviously a homemade dressing.  The romaine was not drenched, as each leaf was turned in the bowl making sure each had just enough of the creamy goodness sitting on it.  

The pizzas are individual size (no ordering small, med or large here my friends).  I'm starting with the crust - just the right amount of yeast and a hint of sweetness kept the inside moist and the outside perfectly crisp.  The choices are varied from a simple Margherita to one that is topped with shrimp, prosciutto, creme fraiche....and the list goes on!  We chose to share one and had sundried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar to compliment the fresh mozzarella and rich tomato sauce.  A touch of dried pepper flakes added when presented sent our taste buds over the top!

So, how to end this wonderful meal?  Tiramisu of course!  This creamy delight covered thick with powdered cocoa arrived in a small clear stemmed glass bowl.  Not the normal square chunk typically served locally I can tell you that!  Every bite, and we ate slowly, was delightful -  the light n' creamy cocoa tinged marscapone zabaglione, the ever so lightly espresso kissed lady fingers and the wonderful hint of marsala can only be described as heaven on the tongue!

Great dining experience through and through!"}
{"text":"salade césar juste correcte. spaghetti aux crevettes ordinaire. Mais très bon service. vin du moment (terra di brolio) est excellent. café tiède... dessert au chocolat excellent."}
{"text":"\"Where am I?\": A pizza restaurant.
\"Why?\": Because pizza is awesome.
\"What am I chewing on?\": An awesome pizza margherita.
\"Cool!\": Yup.

Side note: I love their décor, clean, modern, industrial but without being too cold. 
I recommend going here, any place that makes a good margherita is the bees knees in my book, plus it's very affordable."}
{"text":"Situated in what used to be the Galaxy Diner, the Pizzaiolle on Saint-Denis still has that old diner feel. It's not trendy or chic, but it's cozy. This is my comfort food. It's perfect for one of those casual nights when you just want to relax away from the crowd. Slide into a booth, sit back, and catch up with an old friend or two. Order a glass of Italian red. 

Pizzaiolle is the only place where I always get the same thing: the Capretto (tomato sauce, fresh basil, and goat cheese) on whole wheat crust. Simple, yet so satisfying. Their pizzas are made on a wood oven, and are always solid. Prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"La pizza est toujours aussi bonne. C'est vrai. Mais depuis qu'on a renouvelé le décor l'an dernier pour quelque chose de plus à la mode, ce n'est plus pareil. J'ai moins envie d'y aller. Au lieu de mettre en valeur le côté patrimonial de cette ancienne gare de trains, on en a fait quelque chose d'un peu \"trash\" pas très chaleureux. Dommage. Toutefois, durant l'été, la terrasse extérieure qui donne sur le côté du square des Frères Charon est assez sympathique."}
{"text":"Very good option to avoid the crowd of Saint Paul. Good food for a fare price. I recomend spaguetti bolognese. Very well made."}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant with funky indoor and cool outdoor seating area. I really enjoyed my pizza - but the spot, very tasty! My kids enjoyed their pizza and pasta quite a lot as well. Didn't order anything else. Efficient service - nothing special."}
{"text":"Je suis archi fan !!!!! Un vrai coup de coeur pour ce resto 

Ce petit resto plutôt familial est devenu mon QG. Les pizza sont délicieuses, pates fines, les ingrédients sont posés généreusement, le fromage fond comme il faut. Un délice ! Le tiramissu est aussi vraiment très bon, il est impératif de le partager, sinon vous allez rentre à quatre pates chez vous.

La carte de vin est très complète, mention spécial pour le Procesco qui remplance quasiment un champagne pour un prix tout à faire raisonnable. 

Côté déco... Il y a encore 4 mois, c'était une petit pizzeria de quartier, mignonette, sans fanfreluche, simple mais chic avec vue imprenable sur les cuisines. Aujourd'hui WOW WOW WOW. C'est de la bombe ! La déco est splendide, table de bois brut, table en verre avec écrous apparents, Antipasti disposés à l'entrée et toujours la vue imprenable sur les cuisines. 

Le service y est toujours impecable, les serveurs sont serviables, sympas, drôles.

La Pizzaiolle: Un vrai régal pour les papilles, les yeux, le porte-monnaie et le moral"}
{"text":"I normally don't have much time to review this place after I leave, because I come here on break when at work. But I decided ... this time?! I will pay homage by leaving this review while I eat my scorching hot and VERY delicious saucisse Italianne pizza! Pizzaiolle is a modern style Italian restaurant with beautiful warm decor! The music at a good level and the lighting just perfect. Noise level quiet to average depending on when you go!

1. The service? The service speaks for itself! GREAT service hands down and always consistent!

2. This is my 3rd or 4th time  here and the waitress who normally serves me has already made note of the type of beer (Moretti) I order when I am here! 

3.  They have a happy hour deal which recently finished  for the winter season. Which consist of a small selection of the appetizer menu at a super reduced cost! So far I've tried the meat balls (ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!!!) and the chorizos, calamari and zucchini appetizer. Also VERY good!

4. My last point and VERY IMPORTANT to me specifically is the food! I have yet to be disappointed. The food comes out in a timely manner and SUPER hot and fresh!!!!! Nothing taste like it's been sitting around for a while or reheated! It's perfect!

I recommend:

* the calamari, chorizo & zucchini 
* meat balls & confit of tomatoes
* Spaghetti bolognese 
* Carpetto Pizza
* Americana Pizza
* Saucisse & Italienne 

My 5-star rating goes to the service, food and ambience!"}
{"text":"***Update:

I visited the restaurant again and had a great experience. Food was just as good (I ordered the Spaghetti Cabonera again) but the service was exemplary. Quick, friendly service with a smile and knowledgeable staff made for a great lunch. I'm a big fan of the place. Check it out!



Situated in the Old Port, you cannot find a better location though a little west of where all of the action is, mind you. The interior is chique, and hip. A great spot for a quick work-lunch. I've been twice now and I must say that both times the meals were consistently good. 

This second visit, I ordered the Spaghetti Cabonera. The sauce was creamy and rich, the pasta (tasted) fresh, and it has chunks of meat (bacon/prosciutto), pepper, and egg. Was really tasty."}
{"text":"Super amazing experience here.

First the location is great. In the old port which is my favorite area in Montreal. Second the decor was so original that I couldn't stop looking around at how everything was 'created'. Things looked unfinished on purpose and the lighting gave it a great feel.

Now on the food- PIZZA. SUCH FRESH TASTING PIZZA that I'm craving it as I write this. I got the margherita pizza and added prosciutto which was sublime. I tasted all the ingredients...the tomatoes in the sauce, the fresh basil and cheese. Wow. Haven't had pizza this good since I was in Venice, Italy.

I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends in Montreal and will definitely be coming back here when we visit again! BRAVO PIZZAIOLLE!"}
{"text":"Excelente servicio y comida. Buena relación precio valor, recomendado para pequeños grupos. Excellent service, bonne nourriture. bon rapport qualité-prix."}

Pizza efficace mais sans plus.
Calzone bon et goûteux.
Endroit magifique."}
{"text":"Great margherita pizza! Service was amazing as well. We were seated immediately at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday. The restaurant also has a nice ambience and extensive wine/beer menu."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed.
The pizza crust was thin and zero oil.
Well worth it and price was very good"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great - small but cozy, old-school diner feeling with dark wood panelling and appropriate lighting, terrace was open but still felt reasonably spaced from the busy St. Denis street. 

Pizza was good, I had the Campanella. The dough was being tossed and the pizzas prepared as you walk in. Also had the cheesecake; it was presented well and didn't taste frozen. 

Service seemed to be a bit slow, as several groups that arrived after our group of three had placed our order left before we did. Additionally, the price seemed a bit high relative to the quality. 

Overall, was a nice experience and a good choice if you're in the area, but not worth going significantly out of your way for."}
{"text":"The pizza is cooked in fire grill instead of oven. And there are a few unique toppings. Everything else is the same as the fast food chained pizzas."}
{"text":"Great location, good ambiance, friendly service and that's it. Not a big fan of their pizza. Tried it couple of times but nothing too impressive.  I tried their Lunch special last time. So for 17 bucks you get a salad, Pizza or Pasta, and gelato or coffee. The green salad is nothing but big chunks of \"not fresh\" lettuce and salad dressing. Was bad. Not being a fan of their pizza, I went for the pasta. We were told its penne with creamy white sauce, Italian sausage and cheese. But there was no creamy white sauce at all. It was just melted cheese on boiled pasta. Every time I've been to this place its been a disappointment.


Food : Meh
Service :Friendly
Ambiance : casual
Worth the price : Nope"}
{"text":"The word for today is MAGNIFICENT!

...now ...let me explain why I am using this word for this establishment...  

While in Montreal, we are trying to find places to try out and experience better food, rather than relying on a McDonald's,  Subway or A&W.  (yes...they have a A&W burger joint up here for those of you who didn't know...)  Well, I think we're batting 1000 because we happend across this place by chance, and it...is...AWESOME! 

We got the pizza with Italian sausage,  capicola and vacon.  Delicious!   

Desert was their apple tort.  I have to find out how they made it!  Sooo good!  

Keep up the excellent work guys!  Merci!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Pasta is just ok, but the quality of the pizza definitely made up for the pasta shortfall.

Sitting out on the patio on a beautiful afternoon with a very reasonably priced pitcher of Belle Gueule was fantastic.  Service was spot on as well.

Highly recommend making a reservation in advance for lunch, though.  Also, I would definitely recommend this place for kids."}
{"text":"Loved the décor. Food was decent, but a bit expensive. Would recommend to check out, but with wouldn't return a second time."}
{"text":"Great decor, nicely renovated with an industrial touch. Pizzas were good for the price, but why only the French menu ? I'm perfectly bilingual but ur in the middle of old montreal, pretty touristic area, kinda cutting your business don't you think ?"}
{"text":"I had supper tonight at La Pizzaiolle.

I ordered a Margherita pizza and had pepperoni and bacon added.  It was a really delicious pizza.  The crust was nice and the pizza was cheesy.

Emilie was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Nice patio, friendly staff, great pizza! This place is in a nice area and they have a decent lunch special that comes with a salad, small pizza, dessert and coffee for $17."}
{"text":"Solid pizza place.  Decent looking place.  Just had pizza so can't speak to rest of food - nicely charred crust.  Wish there were more drink options"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup cet endroit de type \"dinner\", qui se spécialise dans les pizzas! Le restaurant est miniature et il n'est pas toujours possible de réserver alors ce n'est pas l'idéal. Toutefois, les portions sont généreuses et les prix abordables. Leurs nombreux choix de pizzas vont plaire à tous! On s'en sort pour une vingtaine de dollars par personne et on sort repus! Mention spéciale à la pizza aux légumes!"}
{"text":"Cute place, we sat outside. Pizza was tasty, but not crispy (and we asked for it crispy!). Sangria - eh. I'd come back for the pizza and insist on then cooking it longer."}
{"text":"La pizza était délicieuse! Nous avons pris la Americana, la Carciofo et le spécial à la chorizo, fromage fumé et poivrons rouges. Elles étaient toutes excellentes. La croûte est particulièrement savoureuse. 
Nous avons été bien accueillis, mais ensuite oubliés. Il y a fallu environ 10 minutes avant que quelqu'un nous offre à boire. Le service était bien après celà. Mais, l'ambience était agréable et détendue. La musique n'était pas trop forte, ce qui facilitait la conversation. 
À visiter pour de la bonne pizza!"}
{"text":"Pros
- Great ambience
- Friendly staff
- Great apps
- Good tomato sauce
- Fair pricing

Cons
- Except for the duck sausage pizza, menu is uninspired
- Pizza/cheese was a touch too oily/soggy in the middle"}
{"text":"I was not quite sure what to expect from the trolley car diner exterior of Pizzaiolle, but the service, the food, and the wine, were all quite good.  The decor is quite modest, so I would not have picked this out for a special occasion, but the food did not disappoint.  I order the farfalle with wine sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, and pancetta.  The pasta was al dente, which is perfect for me, and the sauce, although a bit salty, added just the right amount of flavor.  I would definitely stop back in for an Italian meal."}
{"text":"Skip the pasta or calzone if you like pizza (RE: if you're human) and try: Capretto, Chorizo, or Tiziana.
The waiter made an excellent white wine suggestion.
\"Dessert\": The Brazilian coffee."}
{"text":"Four of us went for lunch and found it to be way too noisy, we were rushed to order and the waiter wasn't very good. We asked for a fork that was missing and he never brought it, our meal included cofee which never came. It was lunch and we didn't expect to be catered like a fine dinner, but at least get us some coffee. Besides the poor service he food was very good. I had the pasta of the day which was a good portion with lots of fresh ingredients. Very tasty. The ohers had pizza was also very good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Pizzaiolle taste wise, but the take-out service could be better. They rarely package/wrap the orders properly."}
{"text":"Totally awesome experience go there perfect pairing of Pizza and Biere so French

Decor is very modern warm and trendy.  Service was just exceptional.  Have to try in Montreal."}
