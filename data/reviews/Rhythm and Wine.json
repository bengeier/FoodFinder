{"text":"The wine is great, the food is really good, what needs work is the service. It's just...variable. I've had great and not so great. I was there on Monday and ordered the cheese platter. My fiancée has a nut allergy and I told the server as much when I requested no nuts. You've guessed it, it came out with a robust amount of nuts. I called the server over and pointed-he never even apologized. Although he took it to the back and \"replaced\" it, I was concerned they just removed the nuts...so worried about them not taking it seriously that I ate the cheese plate by myself. The whole night went like this-just no attitude of caring or putting any effort into ensuring our needs were met and we were satisfied. After my prior experience here I was so impressed I wrote to the manager. This time not so much. I may go back since the setting, food and wine are all good; I'll just need to lower my expectations regarding service."}
{"text":"A little disappointed in this place. One of those situations where all the little things add up to make an overall underwhelmed experience.

First we were sat at our table outside on the patio there was dirty silverware on the floor under my chair. Easily overlooked but whoever cleaned up after the lunch shift should've caught it. And whoever opened for the dinner shift should've caught it as well.

Then our waiter brings us waters... I ask for straws and dish of lemons. He brings us back straws holding them in a bar napkin so not to touch them which is nice. But when he gets to the table he sets the straws down directly on the table. Now I'm not saying the table was dirty but it is an outdoors table and I am saying it was not clean enough to eat off of. So again something small but annoying nevertheless. Then he brings the lemons in a bar napkin and set them on the table as well. this is a relatively decent joint well it's supposed to be, you would think he would've initially brought them on a bread plate or some sort of dish/ramekin as I asked him to initially. 

Next food. We order the mac & cheese as our waiter strongly recommends it. I thought it was not very good. I sent it back. The sauce had broke meaning that I did not come out as a rich creamy sauce it was basically penne pasta swimming in bath of oil. And again this is a small yet large thing.. The flavor profiles of the mac & cheese were good. The chorizo added a nice saltiness to it the jalapenos a nice spice the penne pasta was cooked well. But yet again either the sauce had broke or there was way too much chorizo either way it was not edible. 

Then we order and the bruschetta trio. Again three great ideas but execution lacking. The beef and blue cheese bruschetta is a great idea and had fantastic flavor but there were pieces of meat on it that were literally not cooked. And by not cooked I mean raw. They were raw uncooked pieces of meat on our bruschetta. Again another good concept terrible execution.

Then our prosciutto asparagus bruschetta. There was two little slivers of asparagus. Prosciutto had some rainbow sheen going  on with it so not sure how Quality it was. Then they use cream cheese as the spread on the bread. I mean at least use a brie cheese. What is this your rendition  of bagels and lox with prosciutto? If it is cool but I think you could make it better. From ingredients to presentation

Then to top it off must ask the waiter 10 times for my girlfriend to get a sample of sangria to see if she likes it he never brought it the entire time he forgot multiple things. Not only bad customer service there but also lessening the sales for himself and the entire establishment. If she liked it who knows maybe she would've order two, I was driving that would've been $18 added to the bill. 

Then they were out completely of red Zinfandel by the glass. How can you be a wine Bar and not have a glass of red Zin??? 


And there is more but this review is getting long.. I got to say is that they've got the makings for a good menu but between the incompetence we experienced from the front of the house (this could be isolated to our specific waiter I don't know as this is our first time ) and the lack of execution in the back of the house .....with so many other choices out there not a place that I would return to."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience last night.  Portions were generous and flavorful.  Everyone loved their meal.  Music was good and not overbearing for conversation.  We asked the waitress for a donut sampler and she comped us an entire order which was not necessary along with the apple pie we ordered.  Good wine selection and very fair prices for both food and wine.  The staff was attentive and good coverage per table.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have only been to Rhythm and Wine 1x but it was a good experience overall. I liked the patio and the service was outstanding. The food was average."}
{"text":"Creative food well prepared. The onion dumplings are beyond. Entrees good but not exceptional though barbecue salmon salad was quite nice. Desserts, however, redeemed the meal...deep dish apple pie and skillet s'mores were amazing! Will definitely return for an encore!"}
{"text":"The highlight:  Cute place and good atmosphere.  We enjoyed the live performers.  Negatives:  The service was very sub-par.

It took a long time for a server to stop by to greet us.  I ordered a glass of wine and didn't get it until my meal (after the appetizer and salad).  Our waitress had clearly forgotten to bring it to me.  When she finally brought it, I had even forgotten I had ordered wine.  \"I thought you would want it with your main course,\" she excused.  What?

We enjoyed the bruschetta as an appetizer.  The salad was \"meh.\"  We ordered the prime rib risotto special, which was good and had a nice kick of spice in it.  No one asked us how our food tasted.  No drink refills.  No one cleared our plates, even after we had finished paying.

It was good for a one-time visit, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place but always seem to forget about it. The rockin shrimp is an absolute must! The slider app actually makes a nice meal for the ladies. I love the salmon and my husband loves the chimichurri  skirt steak. Their happy hour is one of the best around!"}
{"text":"No room for Rhythm or Wine @ Rhythm & Wine. This cramped but crazy cute bar/ restaurant has good food but bad service. The food tastes good but presentation lacks. When I ordered the bruschetta plate my first mental words were,   \"Really?\" It tasted just like the menu described. However it was served on a wooden cutting board and it looked like someone was in mid sandwich making progress and said here I give up. Maybe a different plate or a garnish to distract you from the simple looking slices of bread would have been nice. In this appetizer you can choose from four delicious bread topping options.  I was impressed with the 3 I choose they were all paired well with the ingredients listed.  After waiting what felt like 20 minutes for that plates of food I scarfed it down and impatiently waited for my next plate choice, the sliders.
 Slowly sipping on my \"blondes have more fun\" flight of wine I watched the sun set as my sliders approached. The burgers themselves could have been pictured in a magazine but then there were toasted grated potato pieces and sweet potato fries in the middle, so much going on you wouldn't know where to begin, so I took a few moments and overlooked everything. Sweet potato fries, hash brown or grated potatoes cooked well. Ketchup, mayo, 3 mini burgers with cheese and 3 slices of tiny tomato 3 slices of tiny pickles for your little hamburgers. After my first appetizer I was already satisfied but dug into this next plate anyways.  2 burgers and fries and more wine I was stuffed but polished off the third burger anyways because it was still hot and juicy and the bun was still crisp not soggy 
After a few minutes of settling the stomach I order crème bulee maybe service got better because they knew I was leaving but towards the end my water glass never went dry and my dessert was there before I could finish the thought of dessert.  That's the kind of service I like and wanted the entire meal but didn't get till the end. And believe it or not it took the whole staff to provide me with that end of dinning excellent experience! Yep the whole staff.
The advertisement I saw in the mail said Beatles and bottles night on Wednesday. Well I went on Wednesday  4-18-12 and there was no Beatles but plenty of bottles so many bottles in fact that each corner had boxes of wine and not to neatly or artistically arranged but just cluttered in the corner, like behind the hostess stand and next to the bathrooms.  (get a room, a storage room for your extra stock.)
The place is cramped and suggests a dance opportunity but offers no room for it. The bar is horse shoe shaped and around the bar is a sling of tables and chairs offering the crew an oblique muscle workout as they twist and turn between the tight tight maze to make it to their destination. Like the patio, which was closed this night for private party. It would be nice to have the patio extended around the building back towards the front door or just have a bigger patio so when the weather is great we can all enjoy it."}
{"text":"Very good food!!!!! The chicken Marsala excellent and the flat iron steak the same. Good size plates. I recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here!  We go almost every week (sometimes more often).  The food is consistently good and the wine selection is great.  During the cooler months it is great to sit out on the patio when they're having live music.  It does get very busy on certain nights (we were just there last night, Friday, and it was packed) so we try to go mid-week or Sunday for happy hour.  They also do prix fixe menus every few months that are a blast!  You must make a reservation for these, as they close the restaurant for regular seating on these nights."}
{"text":"This review is long, but a must read...
I don't even know where to begin. I am so angry; I can hardly see straight. Let me start off by saying, I have been to this restaurant several times. It used to be good, but the last time I went, and tonight, was bad. Especially tonight. Beyond horrendous...
My mother, who I went with tonight, goes there about 4 times a month, at least. She also knows the owner, Laura, which is what makes this experience even more horrendous with how we were treated. Unfortunately, the last several times we have been there, Laura has not been there. Maybe she needs to be.
The waitress, who was blond, and I believe was named, Ally, was pleasant, however, the entire time, the service was VERY, VERY, VERY slow. Everything we asked for took an eternity to get. May we have bread? That took forever, and came out with a thimble sized amount of olive oil. Since our meal was taking FOREVER to come out, we asked for a few more slices of bread. That took forever again. A few times, we asked the male waiter for help, since the waitress would disappear for a long time.

My mother and I couldn't even enjoy our time together, because we kept wondering and talking about where our food was. Just like they told us the last time I had been there, when the service was horrendously slow, they said they were short staffed. They said there were only 2 people in the kitchen tonight, and 2 waiters/waitresses working. I think it's time to cut the excuses and hire new people. 

After having super tense stomachs from the waiting and wondering for so long when we were going to get to eat, they finally brought our food. This is where things started to go off the rails.....
I ordered the Chicken Lemon Pasta. The waitress said it was \"very lemon-y\". It was a very small portion size. When I took the first bite, I couldn't believe it. There was NOT ONE BIT of moisture, lemon, sauce, or seasoning on it at all. I truly believe the chef took it out of the boiling water, and forgot to put the sauce on it. It was dry as a bone, with not a hint of flavor, no lemon...nothing. 
This was where I finally gave up on this meal. I told the waitress the issue, and just told her she can take it back. I no longer wanted to eat. She kept saying, \"Are you sure? I'll bring you something else. I won't charge you for it.\" But, at this point, I was done. I had lost my appetite from the tension. 
I said, No thank you. Then, all of a sudden, some lady who suddenly had popped up in the restaurant, who was wearing a pink sweat suit outfit, and didn't even look like she worked there, comes over and put a dish in front of me, telling me that the chef had already made the Chicken Lemon Pasta over for me. I told her, I really didn't want it. But, she left it there. 
I ended up eating some of it, not even wanting to, because it was nothing special and my stomach was in knots. 
My mother's meal was this mess in a small cast iron dish. It was supposed to be the Seafood Pasta Shells. The pasta shells were so overcooked, they were falling apart, and in pieces. She said it was not good. She told the lady in the pink sweat suit that she was sorry; that she never complains, but she was not happy with the dish. The lady said, I'm sorry, and said she wouldn't charge for it.
The waitress asked if we would like dessert--that there would be no charge for it. I didn't want anything, since, as I said, I was DONE with this restaurant, and just wanted to leave. My mother wanted the smores, but when the waitress said it would take awhile to get, we said forget it, and got the chocolate cake. We took 2 bites, before the waitress dropped off the check. This is where the straw broke the camel's back. 
No joke; we were charged for BOTH MEALS, with only the \"complimentary\" dessert being deducted. That's where the steam started to come out of my ears. I was so furious, and my mother was completely shocked. First of all, with our horrendous experience, they really shouldn't have charged us for the meals anyway, or at least removed one of the meals, but the complete AUDACITY of them charging us for both meals when they told us they weren't going to charge us, was when the sh-t hit the fan. 
I got up, and still remaining calm, told both the pink sweat suit lady, and the waitress, that they had to be kidding charging us after this experience, and after me saying I didn't even want anything else to eat, and MOST OF ALL, them telling us they weren't going to charge us. 
The pink sweat suit lady took my meal off, but still charged for my mother's. 
I am so angry, because my mother and I really needed this time to spend together, having a nice meal and hanging out. And, instead we left with sick, tense stomachs, and extremely upset. This was wrong on so many levels. 
I would NOT recommend this place, unless you want to wait an eternity for your food, be overcharged for semi ok food, and have knots in your stomach."}
{"text":"So for those of us working our way through a bad economy, of course dinning out has become a little bit less of a priority in the budget.  I pulled a great coupon for this restaurant from Living Social. Not far from my 
home and if \"wine\" is in the name of the place, I'm sure to give it a try.
So, here goes....

Nice area of North Scottsdale,  this restaurant is in a strip mall that maintains a \"higher\" level of tenant than most strip malls.  Of course you've got the feeling you are in North Scottsdale, but this place works hard to have that \"neighborhood feel.\"

As you enter into the inner sanctum, you are greeted immediately by the hostess.  I LIKE that!  Good start.  The place is hoppin' and it's a Friday night in the worst heat of the summer, so they obviously they maintain a good and faithful clientele.  Beautifully appointed ambiance.  Their decorator did a great job.  Tables give ample room and chairs are comfortable. The place is small and tight but you don't feel squished because of the size of your table and chairs.  We were seated against a wall and didn't have that \"pushed to the side feeling.\"

Our waitress Brandy is on the ball and is to our table immediately with explanations of the nights specials and wine specials. Sharp and attentive young woman.  This place has a huge wine storage that is displayed through glass as a main feature wall in the restaurant.  So, one draws the assumption from the name and from the display that they know wine and are serious about it. Interestingly, the wine menu, though massive has no explanation of the wines they offer accept that the wines are broken into very general categories.  Light White, Mild body, Medium White, Medium body, etc.  Mildest to Boldest. No other explanation.

Let me just say on this point, although I am no sommelier, I do know enough to know that a wine from France, Italy, California and Oregon are going to have vastly different flavors than just a general category; i.e., it's a  \"bold red.\"  When I asked the waitress about explanations for labels I had never tried or heard of and suggested further explanation in their \"wine Bible\" she became a little defensive  and explained how the list worked.  In other words, she really didn't know wine, but could tell me that the most expensive items on the list were the \"favored items.\"  Hmmm.... a wine motivated establishment that doesn't train their staff in wine?  Onward to the meal.

We ordered a Caesar salad pre-meal. Almost no flavor of the dressing,  LOTS of white pepper that left a sting in the mouth.

The special was a skewer of Jumbo Shrimp (grilled with veggies) an 8 oz filet accompanied by veggies and buttermilk mashed potato's. 

The shrimp was fine. Nothing to write home about, but good presentation.  The steak was served onto up a huge amount of sweet demi-glaze ( this was not stated in the explanation of the meal) so you got a lot of sauce that didn't exactly have much flavor. The meat, was very tender and cooked perfectly, but had no flavor.  The veggies on the side were great!  The best part of the meal was the mashed potatoes. 

It's not that this place is bad, it's just for the price point, you can do much better with your hard earned money.  

The service of the staff was excellent which that alone would make me go back and try it one more time."}
{"text":"so disappointed! we used to come here regularly and were even part of their wine club for a whole year but sometime within the few month break that we took, the place has gone down hill.

service is sub-par, the huge menu shift now accommodates frozen food lovers, and the drinks are watered down or taste like they game from a pre mixed cocktail bottle.

most recent and last visit we sat at a table by the bar so the \"bartender\" was also our server. my martini had about an inch of foam on it and huge ice chunks and his wine glass was dirty. appetizers were seafood heavy so we skipped but the entrees could have served as appetizers. the entree sized Brussel sprout salad was more like side salad sized and was just unappetizing. there was also about a half pound of shaved cheese on top. the chicken penne was under done and for some reason the vodka sauce had what tasted to be cloves or nutmeg in it. chicken was the consistency of microwaved frozen chicken and there were about 4 bites of food on the plate.

we saw our server about 3 times the entire meal, once was to come take our order after she had already done so. eventually had to flag down another server to get our check for us while the \"bartender\" just kept making drinks. 

we didn't try it, thankfully, but it's worth noting the \"sangria\" is wine over ice with carton orange juice poured in. that's it!?

I'm so sad about the deterioration of this place! what was once a nice little get away is now somewhere we will avoid"}
{"text":"Best bar food I have had in Scottsdale. Head and shoulders above the rest"}
{"text":"I took my wife here on her Birthday Last week and had a great time.  We started with a bottle of sparkling wine, then split some ahi tuna.  The tuna was okay, I personally prefer the White Chocolate Grill for that appetizer.  I had the pork tenderloin.  This was the best tasting I have had in Phoenix.  My wife had the chicken Marsala, it was flavorful and she liked it. The only issue was that the chicken was a very thick breast and she was expecting some thinner...Regardless, it was good.  the desert medley was way more than we could eat, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"R&W was a very pleasant surprise for lunch.  We had a local dines coupon and decided to try it.  The atmosphere was great.   Classic rock playing in the background while we sat on the patio sipping our $5 a glass wine on a beautiful 75 degree afternoon.  After perusing the menu we decided to try the French Onion Soup Dumplings from the small plates menu along with fish and chips and a salad from the lunch menu.

The dumplings were amazing.  Filled with wonderful onions cooked in soup and covered in chewy, stringy cheese.  These little gems were worth every artery clogging bite.  Even my wife, who rarely will eat something this sinful, couldn't stop eating these.  The fish had a nice and crispy golden batter that was not greasy.  Very fresh white fish that was nice and mild.  The homemade tarter sauce was also very good.  Chips are really fried potato shreds.  Not traditional, but tasted good.  

The service was also prompt and courteous.  It's also nice not to get a bit of a cross eyed look when you use a coupon.  It was graciously accepted.  When you have confidence in your restaurant having the opportunity to gain a new customer through a coupon is a great way to increase the traffic from local customers that will keep you going during the off season.

We'll be back for sure.  We go to Jalapeno's Inferno fairly often as it is our favorite Mexican food in the North Valley. These folks own Jalapeno's as well which tells me they have it \"going on\"!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful time at R&W. Scallops app and RNW salad were delicious. Staff was friendly and acoustic classic R&R music was great. Would come back to this place."}
{"text":"Went with neighbors for dinner/wine at 6:30 PM on a Thursday night. We were seated right away at a table of 9. Pace was fine. Lots of variety but made me think \"what do they do well?\".  Folks who had been there before suggested pizza or  brussels sprouts salad.  I had a Caesar Salad with chicken. It was on the small side and just OK. This nite had a promotion of half priced bottle of wine with purchase of an entree making it a reasonably priced meal. Agree with others ... It's load in the restaurant. We will return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We usually go on Friday nights...try to take advantage of their amazing happy hour prices.  The food and service are always great.  We always have these \"Hippie Chips\" - sliced fresh baked potatoes with some dipping sauce....such a lovely appetizer as you drink your wine or beer.  Their pork sliders are awesome as are their salads.  They have a nice variety of foods.  Try it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love to stop by for lunch. Their bruschetta's are so tasty and just enough to get me through the afternoon without causing food coma."}
{"text":"Came to this place for a nice lunch and some wine. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place with music memorabilia on the walls, upside down lamps, and some nice music playing. They even have a nice patio area to sit and enjoy a smoke while you enjoy a meal or a nice glass of wine. They have a nice selection of wine to choose from, and at 11am  - 4pm Monday - Friday you get half off any glass of wine. They have a nice selection of meals to choose from, like sandwiches, pasta, fish, pizza's, etc. I decided to get a pizza called The Doors Light My Fire (with chorizo, pepperjack cheese, and red and green jalapenos) for lunch and my GF got the Waylons BBQ Chicken pizza (with grilled chicken, BBQ sause, red onions and cilantro). Both pizza's were very delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and mother-in-law last Mother's Day.  It was quaint and not too busy.  We sat on the patio and had quick service.  The buffet was ridiculously good.  I mean go-get-another-place-regardless-if-you're-full good.  We haven't tasted the wine yet, but we'll be back for appetizers and wine very soon."}
{"text":"Food was excellent...place was beautiful the reason for low stars was the owner/manager and the very old crowd. Our server was great very friendly but the management did not seem to care was our first visit or my friends birthday she seemed to be more concerned with ordering the waitstaff around. Also beware this place is very popular to a much older crowd in their late 60's and up :-/ salmon salads were fantastic as well as humus plate."}
{"text":"Distinctive food prepared with care and presented well.  Great place for meeting and talking as the good music really is background sound.  What I like most is the  nice staff.  I visited on a Sunday night with a Local Dines coupon and was made to feel welcome.  I will return."}
{"text":"I rate this at a 2 for a few reasons, the menu needs to be laid out differently, meaning graphically pay attention....On 3 separate occasions, it was misread on pricing.

The food selection is limited, not to our personal liking...

The positive, our waitress was awesome, but will we return, no...main reason, the one guest that I talked into returning had the same problem before.....( i had no idea), but she is correct.

Our suggestion, review and understand the menu."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a couple of times. The food is good and the wine selection is better than average. The Marsala chicken is excellent and you cannot go wrong with any of their apps. The atmosphere is pleasant and they have a nice patio. Prices are average, but on par given the food quality."}
{"text":"Great Sunday happy hour! The food is absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way - I am not a wine person.  There, I said it.  So I can't say anything about the wine, but I can tell you the food was absolutely delicious, and the service was very good.  We went on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't too busy, but reading these reviews make it sound very snobbish, which I didn't feel at all.  The waitress was very nice and very attentive.  The manager (I guess?) came by more than once to clear plates/ ask if everything was OK.
Atmosphere was nice, although the table next us was a little close, but hey, I'm not shy.
The food.  Holy crap it was good.  I recommend the pork sliders, but you will DIE for the white chocolate banana cream pie.  Oh, and order the sweet potato fries, they are delicious and packed with Vitamin A!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here in April, soon after they opened (I'll cut them a little slack as a result). The atmosphere was nice, kind of funky with some creative touches. The outdoor porch was not yet finished so we ate inside. The first thing that struck us was there was no music. With a name like Rhythm and Wine we expected some vibes, even if only some great piped in music. The art on the walls of musicians, without any music, simply didn't cut it. The next disappointment was the wine, the other part of the restaurant's name. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and it came to the table chilled. I called our waiter over and asked why they served my wine chilled and he told us all their wines were cooled to the same temperature, as the storage area did not have the ability to separately control reds and whites??? Needless to say we sent the wine back. Soon after, we noticed our waiter talking to several other servers and presumably the owner, who subsequently came over to our table to explain that  \"reds should be cooled to 65 degrees and whites to 55 degrees\" and they thought they would just average the two and serve them all at 60 degrees. After setting her straight we were told by our waiter (recently moved to AZ from Chicago) that we were right. When we received our bill we were told the contractors would be back in the morning to address the issue. The food was OK but over priced in our estimation. I later learned the owners also run Jalapeno Inferno, which is one of our favorite restaurants. I guess this goes to show that one successful restaurant does not guarantee another. Please hire someone who knows wine! We will try it again to see if the contractor solved the problem."}
{"text":"Visted 4/2010 just after they opened patio. Nice setting. Great classic rock tunes. Wait staff seemed like they are still getting the hang of things, including their demographic which appears to be the desert mtn, troon country clubers. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, but thought the wine list was a bit thin in some categories. I think this place has the chance to gain momentum..... we'll go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my sister. It was buy one get one free Summer Fridays! Great Deal.....Green Chili Burger with mixed Sweet Potato and Regular Fries was great! Fish & Chips were great also. The only negative was the Green Chili Burger wasn't as hot as I like my burgers. It is a very nice, well decorated place and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a great place. Delicious food and fantastic service. Always a smile from every employee. Great live music and plenty of parking. Manager Julie is one of the best. My son loves the bacon lol. Thank you guys for so many wonderful evenings!!"}
{"text":"We recently held a large event at Rhythm and Wine, a private party requiring a lot of a restaurant in my opinion. Jordan and Julie were absolutely wonderful to work with. They were helpful, making suggestions when needed and always bending over backwards to accommodate us even when we didn't know what we wanted.  They even secured a talented musical duo for live music, as one less thing for us to worry about finding. Most importantly, the night of our event, our guests were delighted with the food, drinks, ambiance and SERVICE - the R&R staff treated our guests (and us) like VIPs all night. 

What a great place to get out of the heat for lunch, dinner or drinks this summer.  Thanks R&R.  We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Very accommodating! Great food!
Hats off to owners Terry & Laura Craig for another 1st class restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"Three skinny frozen fish sticks was served as fish and chips.
Disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I loved the atmosphere, the wine, and the food.  The charcuterie plate was crazy good and big!!! Highly recommend for a place to wind down after a hard day."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Fans:  My husband and I tried Rhythm and Wine this week.  
We made a reservation through OpenTable and indicated it was our first time at the restaurant.  After we were seated, Julie the Manager came by to say \"hello\" and made a comment she noticed it was our first time.  Nice touch Julie!
We went for Happy Hour and each ordered a glass of wine from the menu.  Wine is $3.00 off a glass during Happy Hour.  You can order a six or a nine ounce glass of wine.  Nice option.  
Maybe you don't want two glasses, but nine ounces would be perfect - - another plus.

Many of their menu appetizers are on the Happy Hour menu at a reduced size and cost.  Therefore, determine for yourself if you would rather pay a few dollars more and get the \"full size\" appetizer or if you want the smaller portion for a few dollars less.
We ordered the cheese platter Happy Hour appetizer.  We asked the waitress if the Happy Hour Cheese Platter was \"the same as the menu appetizer platter\" and she indicated it was indeed the same, only with two cheese selections instead of three.  
Okay, we thought we would give that a try then.  
We received two cheeses (about two ounces each), a few olives, corn nuts, almonds, dried cherries and five pieces of what would be called a Melba Toast.  The Melba Toast served with the cheese platter crumbled into numerous pieces when we tried to spread the Brie we ordered as one of our two cheeses on it.   
Although we were told the Happy Hour cheese platter was the same as the menu platter only with two cheeses instead of three.  But, we did NOT get any assorted charcuterie, chocolate, fruit mustard and local artisan bread on our platter.  I don't know if this was an oversight in the kitchen or if our waitress gave us incorrect information.  
Had we known this (the Happy Hour Cheese Plate was in fact not the same as the menu plate)  we would not have ordered this Happy Hour appetizer for the price.
Julie:  The cheese platter would be much better served with thinly sliced baguette bread and not a Melba Toast product.      
Also, our cheese board was warped and there was a large section of wood that had started to come up on one side.  I put my hand on the board to grab a few almonds and almost got a sliver!  Perhaps staff need to look over the boards used for serving and toss the ones which are worn beyond safety any longer.

Moving on . . . We thought we would try one of the salads.  If you order a main menu meal you can get a side salad for $3.00.  But, the two options did not appeal to us especially since one was a Caesar salad and other Yelp reviews did not find that to be a good option.  
Therefore, we opted to pay full price for the Brussel Sprout Salad (but without the chicken).  Cold chicken on the salad did not sound appetizing to us.  
The salad came with:  Brussel sprouts, bacon, cheese, dried cherries, almonds, an mango-hazelnut dressing.  The dressing was nice and light and not overdone.  The bacon was a nice touch on the salad but it could have been a little crisper (it was chewy). There were plenty of nuts, cherries and sliced cheese on the top.  
Our issue was the Brussel sprouts - the center had not been cut out of them before cutting and tossing them into a salad, so when we took a bite we would get a hard Brussel sprout center which, when uncooked, can be difficult to chew and enjoy.  
Julie:  The brussel sprout salad would be wonderful if the Brussel sprouts were baked in a 400 degree oven with some olive oil/salt/pepper on them, cooled, then cut to make the salad.  That way the hearts could be used/served and not wasted, but the texture would be much more appropriate and appealing.

I ordered the Meat Loaf Dinner. This is a regular on their menu.  Reviews of this dish have been on and off on Yelp.  But, I would like to say:  My meatloaf was not mushy.  It had a nice, appropriate texture, perhaps a little bland (could have used some spices), but a good texture.  The mashed potatoes were nicely done with a few chunks in them - with meatloaf this was appealing to me.  My potatoes were not runny as other reviewers had complained about.  They held their shape on the plate.  The veggies were a mixture of red pepper and zucchini squash, sliced the right thickness and sautéed just until they were fork tender (not overdone).  Overall, I felt the presentation was nice and this menu item (with the exception of the meatloaf needing a little spice/basil/salt or something) was nicely done.  I would order it again.  

My husband ordered the Pasta Special which was a fettuccine with broccoli and chicken.  On Friday night there is a Pasta Special.  For the price the portion was nice.  The sauce on the fettuccine was an Alfredo which had a nice creamy texture.  The chicken was tender and the dish overall was a nice deviation from the regular menu.   
  
A sign on the door indicated $7 wine specials on Friday, but we were not made aware of any.       

Real pepper grinders! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! I went to Rhythm and Wine for a family dinner. Everyone loved their food and our server was amazing. I will definitely go back. They have a great patio with a view and great wines."}
{"text":"Such amazing food! I absolutely love this place. It is good for casual dinner, professional lunch, or a private party. They easily accommodate food allergies. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A nice patio location, but a rather limited selection of wines by the glass for a wine bar.  It also seems odd to me whenever a wine bar doesn't keep their red wines in a wine cooler, as just about all of the reds that we've tried here would have greatly benefited from such a practice.  On a positive note, Rhythm & Wine is one of the few wine bars to offer a Gruner Veltliner by the bottle (if you've never tried this varietal, it's a great summer white), however, they do not keep any chilled on hand so it will be a bit of a wait once you order as they will need to chill the bottle.  

We've had a few of their pizzas which have good flavor, but are a bit oily and heaped with cheese for our liking and the hummus is also good.  When sitting at the bar, the service is generally fairly prompt, but the times that we've sat at the patio and been at the mercy of the owner's daughters to wait on us, the service has been slow to say the least.  In fact, one time, the owner himself actually seated us and then stood around as we waited at least 15 minutes for one of his daughters to make it over to our table so that we could order our wine (which then needed to be chilled as there was none already in the cooler). While you can certainly find better wine bars, in general, Rhythm & Wine is a decent place to stop in at if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon it was really good. The service was great as well. The smores dessert is to die for! I highly recommend this restaurant. It's not easily noticeable. I probably have driven by it hundreds of times not knowing it was there. Do yourself a favor GO! So good."}
{"text":"Tried the happy hour risotto and flank steak. It was great! The cheese board was nice too. Very nicely decorated inside!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight. Loved the atmosphere. Service was outstanding.  We had the Brussels  sprout salad and salmon. Very good and portions were perfect. Nice wine selection. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this establishment.  Service very good, great selection of wines, food was very good and priced well.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips. The tartar sauce was the best I've ever had. Wife had smokey scallops  big plate and loved it. Total was under $50.  No alcohol drinks."}
{"text":"This spot has the best food and ambiance. It has a diverse menu so anybody can find something. I've been here several times and have not been disappointed so far. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. Had the prime rib. Came out perfect temp, will come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place by accident and decided to give it a try; glad we did. The menu is refreshingly different. We had a Brussel sprout salad with dried cherries and marconi almonds in a sweet vinaigrette dressing.  The Brussel sprout leaves were individual plucked and made into a bed for the topping; delicious 

We followed the salad with a wonderful aromatic, taste bud tantalizing, pizza with almond slices, tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves, Irish cheese, topped with goat cheese, on a thin crust.  You can order wine by the bottle, glass, or by selected tasting trays; three small glasses of various wine selections arranged on a attractive wood tray

The prices were fair, the food excellent, and the service good.  The atmosphere was low lighting and inviting.  

I'm definitely going back for more. One of the best date night restaurants we have both enjoyed in some time"}
{"text":"Local place with just ok food, but fun atmosphere, good service, and when it's nice out, a lovely patio with live music. Hubby and I go there 1-2x's per month. Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Great restaurant experience. Delicious from start to finish and the atmosphere is perfect. I really enjoy the live music on the patio and think it's a great place to take guests."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service, delicious food and fantastic ambiance. 5 stars all the way, could not recommend more - from the wine to the food, top notch!"}
{"text":"Rhythm and Wine ROCKS!  What a great place, all around! Four of us had dinner and each of us loved our choices! The Vodka sauce was AMAZING, seriously! So was the Salmon!  For a small neighborhood venue this place is truly a gem! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!  Great Patio, and that night... Live music by the way!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for drinks recently and was oh so pleasantly surprised.  When this place was first suggested, I thought, uh oh, another pretentious place in the heart of materialistic provincial snobbery surrounded by rubes trying hard to impress one another with their disposable overextended credit cards ;-P

I arrive and grab a seat in the laid back, heated outdoor patio.  There's a guy that resembles Lou Reed, strumming his guitar with an excellent choice of tunes.  I kick back and enjoy the atmosphere, which is surprisingly not pretentious, except for the arrogant clown behind me demanding his CRUH-DYTES from the poor waitress that obviously forgot to bring them.  He is rude, he is obnoxious and he's a dick who's probably just looking for an excuse not to tip the poor gal who made an honest mistake on a busy night, while trying to impress his friends with his demanding arrogance.

At any rate. Friend arrives, we order a nice bottle of white wine and a few appies while we just sit back, chat, and enjoy the evening.  Service is competent and friendly. Wine is good.  Food is decent but nothing spectacular but the music is.  I wish I could remember this guy's name.  He was THAT good.  I especially enjoyed the moment when a little girl (about 4 years old), shyly approaches him to make a deposit in his tip jar.  He sees her and starts to play AND sing \"the wheels on the bus go round and round\" and the little girl is absolutely delighted and starts dancing.  Now that's what I call a class act.  Everybody loved it.

Kudos to him and kudos to this place for their business acumen.  I've since been back one more time and hope to return soon............maybe this weekend???

In the meantime, can anybody give me the name of the musician, so we can go when he's playing again???  He didn't look like any of the guys listed on their calendar, so it remains a mystery."}
{"text":"Just found this place a month or so ago. I was at first concerned because the stars were a little low but we decided to go anyway.  I am so glad we did.

It is a great freindly atmosphere. The staff is awesome but so are the people that frequent the place. 

It looks like it has a great pattio and I am looking forward to e joying many evenings on it once the weather cools back down. 

I did not mention the food yet. I guess sace the best for last. The food is very good and surprisingly creative."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the happy hour. I love the wine. I love the decor--it's a little edgy and rock and roll. 

They have their 3rd Annual Nantucket shrimp menu available -- not sure for how long. Not being a meat eater, this was pleasing. I've had their pesto caesar salad, Pacific Rim Salmon and have had a couple of their bistro fries. The bistro fries are freshly homemade made-real thin and not greasy. They are amazeballs!!! 

This visit we sat at the bar for an hour before dinner and the bartender was super sweet. 

Definitely a place to visit in the North Scottsdale area.  It's the same owners of my other fav resturant (jalepeno inferno) FIVE stars!"}
{"text":"So last night my husband and I went on our weekly date nights. And the service here was truly amazing. It made our weekly date night even more romantic."}
{"text":"Glad there is such a venue as YELP.  If there was a category that was LESS than one star they would have gotten it tonight.
1.  The bartender is an arrogant, pompous, jerk sort of a guy.  Of all the bartenders I have met, he is a stand out for being the least personable I have come across in the valley.
2.  The room was incredibly loud...as it is all hard surfaces and not anything to absorb the noise.  We heard every word from the table(s) around us.
3.  My wife and I both ordered burgers.  When they arrived, we both smelled something that didn;t begin to pass our smell test.  Something was either burned or rancid.  My burger...ordered medium plus, came like a burned hockey puck.  My wife ordered hers rare, and it was torched as well.
4.  Both buns...on both burgers... stale and inedible.  The manager explained that due to the low humidity all bread items dry out.  BS.  This was stale in the true sense of the word.
5.  Our server was attentive and pleasant.
6.  The manager did ask how things were...and because we were with another couple, we were reluctant to tell her what a crappy plate of food they served.
7.  We opted for caesar salad instead of fries...and the salad was WARM.  Obviously the chef put the lettuce on the plate...and then put the plate under the lights...and thus explains the warm salad.

We have been to this restaurant before and tonight was our last visit EVER.  So sorry to admit...but we will never go back.  Obviously the chef is a hack and had to be a drop out of the culinary school.

Awful.
Don;t go."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first and Last time.
The service was horrible, if it wasn't for the hostess we would have sat another 15 minutes.
So we had appetizers that were so over priced and not very good.
The special onions that were nothing but a cheese log.
The rockin shrimp was over cooked and tasteless.
So our slow server comes back finally to ask if we wanted to eat ??? Really!!
So at that time we cashed out and went to another restaurant.
They say they play music , which you can't hear.
Bad choice on our part.
Save your money"}
{"text":"My girlfriend treated me to dinner and she suggested to come here.  I was a little weary, however, I wanted to give them another chance.  I haven't been here in over 4 years.  I am not sure if they are the same owners or if there is another chef, but our meals were really good.  I had the scallops over mashed sweet potatoes, who doesn't love sweet potatoes.  The scallops were sweet and tender.  Delicious.  My friend ordered the halibut over forbidden rice.  I had a bite of the forbidden rice, very tasty.  I need to come again and check some other dishes."}
{"text":"Very cool and funky room.  The wine list is good and the cocktails are inventive and well made.  The only drawback is the food.  The food is bad.  Small portions and high prices.   The chicken entree is about the size of one large chicken wing.  The flat skillet steak  was cold - I get that beef can cool - but this cold.  It was clear the beef sat while the made the potatoes, which were plenty warm.  The bruschetta was awful.  We took two bites out of it - and it didn't dawn on the wait staff to ask if there was a problem.  With all the great spots in Phoenix - skip this one."}
{"text":"Rhythm & Wine did a fantastic job for Derby day yesterday! Many theme drinks, table trophy arrangements and a fun hat contest! 

I recommend seeing their newly remodeled layout beautiful and welcoming! The menu has a wide variety to offer everyone."}
{"text":"Good location. Good service and cool atmosphere. Beer was cold and I learned about Scottsdale Blonde beer-Excellent. 

Appetizers were very average. Meat loaf sliders were tolerable. Deviled eggs awesome but the Caesar's salad was pretty bland. 

Old rock in roll in the background. 

Over all 3 Stars."}
{"text":"We went here recently for dinner, and the first thing I noticed was the ambiance. We sat on the patio and enjoyed a very nice view of the sunset. They turned on the fire and the heaters and it was excellent. I love all the neat lights they have outside. 
The service was very friendly and quick. We got the baked brie appetizer and it was pretty good, but I don't think it had the \"cherry apple chutney\" mentioned on the menu. There were some grapes on the side? It was a little bit of a let down. 
I ordered Terry's Tuna Steak , and was not impressed. It seemed kind of dry and not really rare. The flavors were good, I just wasn't blown away. Next time I'll try something different. For dessert, we had the white chocolate banana cream pie, which was awesome! One piece was enough to split between 2 people."}
{"text":"I had the Fish and Chips special today. Loved the Fish but despised the shoe string potatoes. They are simply too hard to eat. Darn little things are hard to grab and dip and don't try eating them with a fork! Fish coating was crispy and the white cod was very fresh. Change the fries and I'm good to go! I had originally given the restaurant 3 stars but increased it to 4 start because the wait service and great attitude of the staff made it a very enjoyable experience. Lynnae was really great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a drink on the patio or the bar to unwind from the day.  Nice atmosphere, nice staff and great happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"I give this a solid 4 stars.  The patio and live music does set this place apart from most.  What a great ambiance and relaxing place to be late on a Friday eve or even early for a cocktail or two for Happy Hour.  

We are not too impressed with food selection and truthfully have not had the best food the past couple times we have been there.  The bruschetta was ok, but I think we were trying to compare to Postino's.. to which there is no comparison.  Just ok on that front.  

However, they have revamped their menu and their wine selection is excellent.  We did not eat anything else other than the bruschetta the last time we went but the wine was really good and the entertainment was also soothing and not too loud.  

This is a great place to go to enjoy the AZ weather and a glass or two of wine.  The service we had was also excellent the few times we have been here so I have no problems at all regarding the service.

Perhaps our next time we come, we will try something else, but based on the bruschetta, it is hard to recommend a specific food choice here but they have made a change in the menu for the better."}
{"text":"Interesting menu.  We had the hummus appetizer which came with warm wedges of pita, a roasted tomato salsa, tzatzeki sauce, as well as the hummus which was very good.  Then a salad made with Brussels sprout leaves and almonds which was a new and yummy taste for us in a salad.  We shared the tortellini with a rich pesto.  I had a \"Comfortably Numb\" cocktail, a very alcohol rich take on a margarita which was excellent.  The bar is intermingled with the dining areas including an outdoor area.  This made for mild discomfort initially when we're seated along a traffic aisle next to the bar but the owner was there and stepped in to help with our service there.  A great place to dine if you like some unique takes on traditional food selections and appeared to be a great place for \" Happy Hour\"."}
{"text":"I love the music since it creates a very cool atmosphere.  The food and the service are very good.
For us dog lovers, the patio is the best.  I live close by and this is a terrific spot to just stop in for a drink and a casual meal."}
{"text":"We tried to dine at this place a couple of months ago, and when told the hostess we didn't have a reservation, she kind of gave us \"a look\" - you know the kind! Like, how dare we even THINK of just walking and EXPECT to get seated. Can you say \"Snotsdale\"??? Well, we decided to go back...reservations made even though it was mid-week. We were so glad we gave it another go. First of all, the ambience is really cool - upscale feeling but sprinkled with humor. Upside down table lamps act as chandeliers - how fun is that???!!  And the name of many menu items is a great pairing of humor and song/artist, too. Great posters & artwork grace the walls; the wall colors are soothing. And, if a restaurant has \"wine\" in their name, you should expect to see their stash. Rhythm and Wine has a large glass wall displaying theirs. Nice.

Although they have a very nice patio area, it was during one of our cold snaps so we opted to eat inside. We had a great view of the sunset which was a plus. We were seated just before happy hour ended but our server squeaked in our order so we were able to have one glass of wine at happy hour prices ($3 off). Speaking of wine, they have an extensive list, but also have a full bar if wine isn't your choice of an adult beverage.

We split the \"We go the Beet\" salad - it was huge! More than two could eat. For entrees, we had the Chimichurri Marinated Flat Iron steak and Courtney Loves this Chicken pasta. The steak was sooo good and very flavorful. The chimichurri gave it a spice kick; it was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The pasta arrived in one of those neat slanted bowls. Again, pasta cooked perfectly and plenty of chicken that you didn't feel cheated.
We are so glad we went back - it is definitely on our list to visit again."}
{"text":"In our \"hood\" and finally got to try it out.  As other reviewers mentioned, you really need reservations as it is a very popular spot in a somewhat less than popular location.  We were seated at the bar, which was just fine.  They were very busy and the food too a very long time to come, but the bartender did a great job keeping us posted on the status.  Food was good...a little salty, but good.

Will make reservations next time."}
{"text":"What really got me interested in trying this restaurant was the \"Afternoon Delight\" special Mon - Fri between 11 and 4pm, where all of the wine they sell by the glass is half price! That, and we had a buy a lunch entrée get one free coupon. 

We ordered and split THE DOORS' (LIGHT MY FIRE) pizza topped with
local chorizo, red & green jalapenos, cilantro, pepperjack cheese, chile flakes and WAYLON'S BBQ CHICKEN pizza topped with smoky barbeque sauce, grilled chicken, red onion, cilantro and mozzarella and Irish cheddar. I really enjoyed both dishes, but my favourite is the BBQ chicken.

We paired it with Chianti, Stellina di Notte, Tuscany, Italy; Red Blend, Merkin Vineyards, (Chuppacabra), California; Cabernet Sauvignon, BR Cohn \"Silver Label\", Sonoma, California.

The service was good, the food was delicious, the wine list is interesting and they have a few bottles that range $100 + if you like to spend big, but on Wed. nights they have a special, Beatles music all evening and HALF OFF WINE BOTTLES!"}
{"text":"Just dropped in on a rainy day for dessert. I ordered the fondue... :/. The chocolate was good, but the food to dip in it was sub par. Graham crackers, strawberries, apple slices, marshmallows, and dry pound cake. Very meh. The decor was strange. I liked the upside down lamps and Beatles pictures, but the whole look of the place was not cohesive. The bartenders were very friendly. The french onion dumplings were actually very good."}
{"text":"Nice place, used a Local Dines coupon. Bruschetta good not GREAT like Postinos. Very Slow and quiet the night we went."}
{"text":"Nolan is my go to server here and I love the food and atmosphere! Great for a date night! I highly recommend the lemon pepper chicken pasta."}
{"text":"Looks like a nice place but whhhhooaaa!! Stop don't go here! Awful service - awful food - looks like sorry to say it but \"loser locals\" that have no idea how to rate a wine ---- at the end if your bartender and \"wine concierge\" has no idea how to \"cork\" your \"nice\" bottle of wine ---- move on NORTH!!!!! Keep going don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years but recently has very good food and service and excellent wine deals. It was so good I went twice in same week! Excellent healthy salads with choice of protein and excellent \"wow\" artichoke dip! Spicy too! Great pizza and my halibut was good to the last bite! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went here because of the certified dog friendly patio but was pleasantly surprised about really well prepared food. 

I had the BBQ Salmon Salad. I don't know what kind of salmon they used but it sure tasted like Loch Duart. The fish was rich and creamy with rich flavor. This a very above average preparation of salmon. The salad underneath was nice and fresh tasting. I liked the fresh cut corn in the salad.

My husband had the lunch meatloaf platter and swapped out the garlic mashed for the house made potato chips. Everything on his plate was seasoned well. The meatloaf was delicious but a little mushy in texture.

Service was friendly and we were checked on often.

This is a small restaurant with a stylish but funky decor. The outside (dog friendly) patio is  large. 

On this visit I didn't hear any rhythm from music nor did I indulge in wine but I did have a very nice lunch."}
{"text":"I just want to say I had a great experience at the restaurant the other night. The food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful and Kelly did an amazing job serving us. I give them a five star rating! Keep up the good work Kelly..."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit and I can tell you with the utmost certainty I will be back. I met friends for dinner and they suggested we meet here.  The vibe was cozy and relaxed, staff was friendly and attentive. 
None of us had been so we decide to order and share. First the mussels to start, amazing flavor with lots of sauce so ask for extra bread for dipping. 
Main course was Scallops with mashed sweet potatoes, flank steak with risotto and the chicken marsala. 
All three were fabulous but I was particularly fond of the Scallops. 
To finish it off we tried the cheesecake which was spectacular. 
I look forward to coming back in season to enjoy the live music on the patio."}
{"text":"Had the meatloaf and short ribs. Both came with way too many julienne veggies thrown on top of the ribs. Made for a messy presentation.  Flavor was average but not tender at all. 

Meatloaf was very good. Garlic mashed potatoes were cold and below average in flavor. 

Service was very good."}
{"text":"Their spinach and artichoke dip is one of the best I've ever had. The fact that the tortilla chips are served warm makes it even more delicious. Went for lunch with my hubby and we were not disappointed, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cool trendy interior and nice patio. The wine list is a little unbalanced and not in favor of the customer.

Very trendy and good romantic venue. Hubba Hubba. Staff is attentive and courteous. 

I can only speak to the happy hour street tacos. They were well conceived but would be awesome with a Lime Cilantro dressing or cool salsa; just a little dry for my taste.
I will come back again and check out the real eats at a later point. It's fun just to see how people construct their wine programs.
#vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Quick update-lunch with some friends.  I had the fish and chips.  Light, lovely batter and loved the mix of sweet potato and russet chips.  Housemade tartar sauce was very tasty.., almost as good as Frisch's tartar sauce!  Really liked the fruity ice tea and our server kept my glass topped.  She was a very good server.  A good experience yet again!"}
{"text":"I live right near here but have only been a couple times, it's a neat little place! I haven't eaten here in a few years so this is just a review on the drinks and everything else. 
Happy hour is pretty good here! They have a bunch of different wines, the couple of ones I tried were very good. My friend who came with me enjoyed the wines he tried as well. I was surprised how busy it was during happy hour since there isn't really much in the area, didn't expect many people to be there! Was not too crowded though, thankfully. We were able to get seats at the bar. The bartenders were all very sweet and friendly, we liked them! Also the ambiance here is really cool, we especially liked the lava lamps. Great outdoor seating too! And you can bring your dog sometimes, my parents have done that before! It is overpriced though, but that is not uncommon for places in North Scottsdale. I have to come back and give the food another try, enjoyed my experiences here!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite go-to-feel-good restaurant!  We love this place.  Tried it for Happy Hour and were blown away by the French Onion Dumplings and the Baked Brie, followed by the pork roast that we shared.  So we went back the next week with our hubbies who raved about the Fish & Chips.  The pastas and chicken dishes are fantastic too.  I'm convinced there is nothing bad on the menu.
And the service both times was attentive and better yet - fun.  Definitely made our time even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"They have good food, but unsure of how I feel treated here.  Every time I come here I feel like a bum off the street, when I'm actually the exact opposite, and why aren't I treated like I'm worth something.  I think their management needs to work on themselves and their staff on how to make their customers feel appreciated and valued, since we are keeping you open."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon to try this place for the first time. Very friendly staff. The food was very good. My wife said the spicy shrimp was so good that she wants to order that again next time we go there. The service was prompt. The restaurant had a nice ambiance.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for Happy Hour and have loved it both times! The half-off appetizers allowed us to order a nice variety and sample a lot.  We ordered the French Onion Dumpling (amazing), the cheese board (we went with our servers 3 suggestions and he was spot -on), bruschetta (3 types - all delicious), the brie in puffed pastry (hands down, my favorite) and the shrimp diablo which is one of their specialties.  It had a nice kick to it and we found ourselves sopping up every bit of the delicious sauce with the French bread that came with it. Yum...

We had a couple glasses of wine each and didn't have room for the fondue dessert that we all shared at our last visit. Next time... :)

By the time we left at 7:30 every table and chair  was filled.  Was nice to see.  Even the bar and the patio was filled with people enjoying themselves.

We'll definitely have to work this into our Happy Hour rotation more often.  Loved it.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The Brown Ale was delicious, can't remember the name, but the alcohol is def. the best part about the place. But frankly put, this place was way overhyped. I went here for an office get-together and we ordered just about every appetizer and shared plates. Nothing stood out to me that would separate it from any other steak and fish place in the area."}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying this is one of my favorite restaurants. Starting when you walk in to see Lolita Wine glasses being kept for there wine club. The rock n roll shrimp is great it has a kick to it but just the right amount. The bruschetta board is a fabulous appetizer. I would recommend sitting on there back patio for some relaxing views."}
{"text":"THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

Rhythm + Wine a super chic, very slick, wine bar in North Scottsdale, in the Market Street Social District.

Apparently, Rhythm + Wine has been there since 2010, but I've never noticed until yesterday when I saw their big \"Newly Remodeled\" sign.

I popped in to check it out and immediately I fell in love with their vibe. I could totally see myself hanging out here.

Mostly noticeable and striking is their wine display case. I'm so easily impressed, as long as it's something awesome, and it is gorgeous, which it is both of the above.

I popped over to the bar, where I met the bartender, David, and the manager, Frank. Both were VERY charming.

I started with their flight of the day, which was a Pinot Noir selection, including Cloudfall, La Crema, and Imagery. It was a nice threesome choice; a light, a medium, and a heavier pinot.

Then I tried their Chef's Board, which I picked the Irish White Cheddar, Manchego, and Brie: YUMMY!

When I spoke with the manager, Frank, he told me about upcoming VIP events, including their Kentucky Derby party, and possibly a Bourbon & Cigar party. Both sounded super fun; I can't wait!

CONCLUSION 

I really like Rhythm + Wine. My only complaint is that it's in a strip mall situation that doesn't make it look as good as it is.

Rhythm + Wine gets my vote!

5/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"What a great place! Hubby and I came with my parents for dinner. The server was so cordial, friendly, attentive. The food was great; between the four of us we had two pizzas, a salad, and burger. All were fresh and the ingredients were top-notch.

The owner are stopped over afterwards to see how everything was and we had nothing but positive things to report. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and entertainment.  We sat on the outdoor patio for dinner one time and the music was awesome.  They have a nice outdoor patio that is dog friendly (YEA!) and they have a pooch happy hour one night a week.  The outdoor patio also has fire tables which are fun.  The food was all very good and the waitstaff very attentive and friendly.  The grilled cheese and soup was awesome...as were salads and the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff. Take note of the nightly specials and music. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Wow, the better than sex martini is awesome !! Spinach artichoke dip is great, the chips are so good!"}
{"text":"I must have serious bad luck because my experience was far from 4 stars.

Staff was cold, unfriendly and inattentive. The prosecco, red wine and Bordeaux Baked Brie were awful.

Maybe I should give it another chance, but I doubt I'll be able to work up the motivation (unless someone dragged me there, hint hint)."}
{"text":"This is our third time here and not much change from our first visit. Service was ok this time, previous 2 visits were bad. The problem this time was not our server, but the fact that she was overloaded with tables. Clearly understaffed. What puzzles me the most is that the same owners operate Jalapeno Inferno which is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. They have great food, good prices and excellent service. They always are staffed to meet demand. I saw the owner more often than our server because she was so busy.

The Food: The food is good, but not great. We had the cheese plate appetizer which had more bread than cheese. For $15 all we got were three tiny pieces of cheese. Best cheese plate in town is at Sassi ($10). This one was a joke. It should have been called a bread plate. Speaking of bread, I saw bread brought to all the other tables but ours. This was before we got our Bread (Cheese) plate. I guess we were invisible. 

Drinks: Wine prices are very overpriced. I think that the owner is trying to make this an upscale place, but it is not. It is casual dining and the drinks should be priced accordingly. Their wine prices are higher than the high-end restaurants we visit. The staff are not wine experts either.

The only reason we came again is because we had a discount coupon. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you have a coupon also. If you want to have a reasonable bill, pass on the wine too."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a group of friends - we get together twice a month and thought this would be a fun experience.  The service was so bad.  It took over an hour to get our food after we ordered - and it wasn't even that busy.  The waiter dropped some \"hippie chips\" off my plate when he finally brought the food.  We apologized and said he'd be right back for more, then never came back.  Drink refills were non-existent.  I had the chicken panini, which I remembered as good.  However, this one was missing cheese, and most of the chicken.  It was very dry and disappointing.  I also remembered the hippie chips as having some sort of seasoning on them.  These had none.  No worries, I only had a few left after they were dropped by the waiter.  Another 30 minutes to cash out once we received the bill.  None of the staff seemed to care.  They are running an Gumbo special this week.  My friends said it was very excellent - so one extra star for the Gumbo.  For the price, there's better food out there, and much better service."}
{"text":"Recently ate at R&W. I liked the interior and I really likely the fact that they owners were pitching in and checking in with the patrons. The wine selection was very good.

I liked the food menu overall but I feel they need to arrive and what it is they want to be and this is where I feel there needs improvement. I really wanted to have the sliders but I don't like sliders on Onion Buns. Now I like onions as much as the next person but not in my bread and as an intergal part of the meal. Morton's serves onion bread and I really like it but they don't serve onion bread steak... We ended up ordering a pizza and a salad, both of which were good. Music was marginal, early 70's CSN&Y etc., but I understand that for dinner, you probably don't want or need Van Halen.

So I would try it again. The fact that the owners are so invested in the restaurants success impresses me. The wine selection is very good. The food is good. The menu needs some work as in Croque Monsieur (it would be interesting to know how many times this is ordered for dinner, lunch sure, dinner ???)

Based on the owners efforts and the food execution, I am going to give it a 4 formally but a 3.5 if I could score it that way.

PS.... I thought the waiter was somewhat smug as opposed to genuinely nice. This should be improved.


PSS... We will try it again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and were awestruck at how good the food is. I sampled everything we ordered at the table including: roast chicken, steak, fish, and pork. All were perfectly done. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What a great place, the food is amazing and our server Chris was so good. The atmosphere and live music was perfect, all in all just a great experience!"}
{"text":"The missus and I ventured to Rhythm & Wine last night in search of pals. We learned they had left about 10 minutes sooner, so instead, we sat down and had some scrumcious wine and a small bite. 

My wife loved the salmon and the salad, and I just dug on the sliders in a tasty way. The vibe was good, light classic rock aired overhead and the wine slipped in nicely on a Thursday night. And we got to meet owner Terry! Cool!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times (upwards of four) and each time the service is very slow and mediocre. The food is very, very good though. From appetizers to entrees, they definitely have good food for any taste."}
{"text":"Post shopping stop! Wanted a place that had:  warm comfortable environment, great wine selection, excellent food, local, reasonable pricing- Rhythm and Wine met the criteria and more! Great friendly service, home made rosemary bread , creative salads and an incredibly glutinous dessert. 

Excellent night out, would come back again as my preferred local choice!"}
{"text":"Rhythm and Wine is a fun little North Scottsdale gem with some really interesting fare.  I probably would've never heard of this restaurant, much less given it a try, if it weren't for seeing the $30 for $15 deal on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  There's a pretty flashy ambiance to the dining room.  Pictures of classic rock stars are pretty obvious decor for Rhythm and Wine's theme, but the upside down table lamps on the ceilings and walls add a really fun touch.  The menu offers up item named after rock bands, movie stars, and song titles.  The menu is also pretty extensive for a wine bar.

We started with the french onion dumplings.  The menu says that you shouldn't leave without trying it.  The menu gave some solid advice.  What a cool take on french onion soup as an appetizer to share.  The onions were wrapped in a wonton shell, covered in gruyere cheese, and swimming in a small skillet of broth.  A very satisfying start to our meal.

I had the \"dixie chicks\" marsala.  This may be one of the best chicken marsala dishes I've had from a non-italian restaurant.  The mushrooms and marsala wine sauce were the sweet stars of the dish.  My wife felt it was a little too sweet for an entree, but I am certainly not complaining.

My wife had the chimichurri marinated flat iron steak.  The steak was cooked perfectly, but the chimichurri was way too unexpectedly hot for her.  I took a few bites and it didn't bother me, but I like spicy food.  She likes some spice, but it became too much for her to handle.  After wiping most of the chimichurri off the place, she ate most of the steak, but left nearly all of the covered vegetables.  Chimichurri is not typically spicy.  It would've been nice for the description on the menu to note that they make it that way.

That dish aside, the atmosphere and well cooked food will certainly warrant another visit to Rhythm and WIne in the future.  Especially if it is still on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485)."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. We were excited to try this place because it had a beautiful outdoor vibe and live music but everything else wasn't that great. Greeted by the owner who wasn't very pleasant, we told him we had no problem waiting 40 minutes for a table outside and that we would just be at the bar having a drink. Martinis were good and so was the cheese plate. When it started getting busy this place was a disaster, clearly understaffed, and our waitress outside seemed like she was losing her mind. Asked for the heater to be turned on, and there was no propane, waitress also didn't know how the heater even functioned. Food was bleh, North Scottsdale has such great restaurants I wouldn't come here if you're looking for decent food or friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, reasonable prices, and great music on the patio. We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and great service from Cody! Food was ok, mussels and bruschetta board were really good but the pizza was underwhelming. Bar seemed busy and drinks were slow to come from there but overall great experience. Service was outstanding and if you go in ask for Cody she was on top of her game. Saw many people come and and stand and wait because no one was greeting the door or seating guests, even saw a couple walk out confused that no one was up there."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this restaurant for the first time this week.  Randy L. will be glad to know they now have music and even a live act on Saturday night.
They have wine flights (which I enjoyed one the white selection) and their wine prices are reasonable and their list is very interesting.
My husband had the poached Halibut which was very tasty while I ordered the Napa Nicoise Salad.  I really liked my salad, the seared ahi was perfectly cooked and very good quality.
My only complaint was the service.  Our waiter was not very friendly while the owner made sure to stop by our table and asked about our food.  It's pet peeve when a waiter asks if you will have dessert, you say no, and he brings the check.  Dude, how did you know we weren't going to order more wine (make the tab higher and therefore,  tip you more).  
We'll be back again but hopefully won't get the same waiter."}
{"text":"My wife and I took some friends here after dinner on the advise of another friend. It has an eclectic atmosphere, and a cozy patio with live acoustic music. That made the experience fun, however the food was less than memorable. We ordered the cheese board, which was kinda boring with a couple pieces of cheese and unexciting bread. I'm not a wine conesuirre, but for a wine bar with a casual atmosphere I found the prices a bit high. I also found out this place is owned by the same owners as Jalapeño Inferno which I love. They should bring that same uniqueness to this place."}
{"text":"Bar none the Best!!!! Rose is fantastic and the Saturday night prime rib is to die for."}
{"text":"Took my mom here after hiking Pinnacle at Sunset. Highlights: Brussel sprout salad and live jazz music.. we recommend sitting outside if the weather is cooperating! Easy going feel, so you can dress casually or semi-formally. We also ordered 3 bruschetta options, all of which were ok.. I'm usually a big fan, so it was slightly disappointing in comparison to what I was expecting. They always have a short list of bottles of wine for a good deal, in addition to their regular wine and cocktail lists. This would be a perfect place for a first date!"}
{"text":"Cool funky vibe decor. I had a burger which was perfectly cooked, and my girl had chicken and pasta with green beans which she liked. App was the artisan cheese platter, which we both enjoyed. Waitress was great. Kept our drinks full and was friendly."}
{"text":"Everything pulls you in to this place from the one of a kind light fixture arrangements to the fire-y sunset view. There's a warmth at the bar I felt as soon as I sat down. Eating the scallops appetizer was about as close to an orgasmic opportunity one can get with food. If you're going to have the bruschetta, you must choose the bacon option. It will be an unforgettable experience. The music is not so loud that you can't have a very companionable conversation across the bar. My husband and I came here on a date night and we were sad to leave. My only complaint was there was no complimentary Perrier for our dog."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant when I was In town visiting family for a wedding. I was really impressed. Would be a really great place for a date night. The Decor alone was something worth seeing, really cool art work. I was really impressed by the bbq shrimp appetizer. I also recommend the chimichuri steak which my husband got as his main course. Garlic mash accompaniment was awesome. The service was also a plus didn't feel rushed and was able to have a great conversation. Would recommend this quaint and comfy spot to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for something \"different\" for our first anniversary. The owner was lovely and granted my possibly odd request to fondue our now defrosted wedding cake for dessert. 
Everything we tasted was spectacular from the unique bruchettas (loved the fig, apple and brie one!) all the way through to our fondue dessert.  I had a white pizza that was perfect and my husband had the chophouse fillet and didn't leave a bite behind.
There was a guy playing acoustic guitar on the patio and when he played both some Jayhawks and then Ryan Adams, I almost fell in love. 
Our server was personable and charming without being intrusive, the ambiance was lovely - I really liked the slightly funky decor and the art collection is something to marvel at. 
My only complaint is that this is so far from where we live. None the less, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriend's go to wine bar. Tried them out for the first time a few years ago and it's hard not to go back. The daily wine specials are great, the live music they have is awesome, the whole music theme itself is very refreshing for a wine bar, and the food is good also. My only gripes are the food menu could be expanded a little and the last few times we have gone there have been some incredibly loud drunk women at the bar talking and joking with the bartender and it seemed everyone around us (including us) were getting really annoyed. Not appropriate behavior for a wine bar, maybe a sports bar. Otherwise this place is great! I highly suggest coming during dusk and sitting on the patio while the sun goes down, beautiful! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"The happy hour used to be amazing, then, something changed a little while ago and its not as good.  I don't know if they have new management or something but the food isn't quite as good as it once was. Finally, you're a WINE BAR, you can not serve warm red wine.  Pinot Noir should be served at 56-61 degrees.  In Arizona, room temperature is 80...You guys really need a wine fridge so you don't keep wine on the bar in direct sunlight."}
{"text":"Ok, normally everything is GREAT! Tonight...... the Caprese salad, the mozzarella was dry around the edges, like it was starting to go bad. The Salmon was overcooked making it dry and chunky and we had to ask for Seasonal Fruit on the Cheesecake. We'll go again its close by and usually good."}
{"text":"Meh. I hate to give small businesses a bad rating, so I gave this place 3 stars. Really, it was probably closer to 2. Ate here for lunch today, and I'm sorry to say it was lackluster. First, the better stuff - my daughter had the grilled cheese meal and it was okay. It could have been great, but the fries were a little on the soggy side and the bacon was cold and chewy. Other than that, she enjoyed it and the tomato soup. The server was friendly. The iced tea was good.

Now the bad - I ordered the caesar salad. For the love of God, please don't ever order their caesar salad. They make it sound really interesting on the menu with baby romaine hearts and a pesto caesar dressing. It was just your standard run-of-the-mill Red Lobster quality caesar salad with COLD grilled chicken on top. Nothing special at all about it. Seriously, I've had better caesar salad from fast food places. Not only is this salad a whopping $13 (and it was so small I was still hungry afterward), but I also had to ask for my chicken. Yep. They brought me the salad with no chicken on it. Then I asked where the pesto was. I was informed it was in the dressing. I wonder if they buy some bottled \"Pesto Caesar\" or something because the dressing did not taste homemade at all. I apologize if it somehow is, but it tasted like a bottled Italian dressing. I hate it when caesar is like that. Thank goodness I had a coupon for buy 1 get one free lunch, or I'd have been pissed.

Anyway, they very well might have better stuff on the menu. Like I said, the grilled cheese meal wasn't bad. The caesar was a waste. I won't be back but you might still give it a try."}
{"text":"Fun spot, good service and so-so food.  Overall, it has some nice energy and an eclectic environment so I would recommend. Just don't go expecting a great meal."}
{"text":"Would have given R & W a 5 star rating if it hadn't been for water glasses with old lipstick still on them. Was assured the \"dishwasher would be checked .\" At some point safe serving practices need to address this issue. There's wax in lipstick people, need to hand wash the rims before putting them in the dishwasher. On the other hand, our meals were excellent. Pulled pork sliders, the shrimp in butter/beer sauce and bruschetta were all excellent. I live out of town and doubt the 'rents will give it another chance due to the cleanliness issue."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, my husband and I have been here about three times and every time we have gone away happy. The first time we came we just wanted to try a few apps and a couple of glasses of wine. We ate the baked Brie cheese which was really good and then we split the fish and chips, which were just average. The second time we ordered the tortellini, it was really good and my husband ordered the chicken Marsala, which he loved. The third time we went we tried the chimichurii flat iron steak, which rocked! And my husband had the pan roasted chicken, he said it was good. Each time we have gone back the food has amazed us, as well as the service. The staff is so friendly and very knowledgeable. I am so happy they are so close to us. Can't wait to try them out during the nice seasons where they have live music on the patio. Love, love this place."}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to like this place. There's 3-4 of us that go out every Friday afternoon for some drinks and apps. With more and more places closing or getting worse this place was close, looks nice and in general is not a totally bad place.

We went a couple times and things were pretty good. Nice patio and good happy hour.  We went a week ago and my friend and i had our normal Long Island Ice Teas. Now, I've had them from Hawaii to NYC and when they're made right, they're refreshing and nice., When they're made bad...the WORST drink on Earth.

One sip and we both gagged, looked at each other and did the Ug dance. I took them back to the guy and my friend played it safe with some scotch and I thought I'd try a margarita. DUMB MOVE Ron. The bartender kid said they didn't do a lot of cocktail biz so they had no Grande Marnier and he said they squeezed their own limes.

Now, the margarita is the most popular drink in America so you'd think people could make it right - especially in Arizona. Not so. I knew the taste I was tasting but put my thoughts on hold. This time the food scored a 6 with the chips limp and greasy (actually dripping) and needed a replacement.

We decided to give this one more try this last week. I made the same mistake of ordering a Rita. When i asked the waitress/bartender (after another bad drink) it turns out the kid last week wasn't even a bartender... AND YET HE'S MAKING A COMPLICATED LONG ISLAND? And... turns out my taste buds were correct.. they use Pope's lime - Not fresh. Pope's is the worst with that weird heavy aftertaste that is as fake a the lemon and lime juice you buy in the store in the plastic fruits.

If you're going to run a place and invest the money and time, USE FRESH QUALITY INGREDIENTS.  I don't think i'm asking too much.

So many places are cutting corners, lacking service, poor food...they must think the public will put up with anything to drink and eat out. NOT SO. Fill up your bar with some good stock, Make your own sour mix, teach your waiters NOT to be a bartender and get some consistent food coming out from the back. There's too many options when eating out to go to places that don't care enough.

Again... just keeping it real."}
{"text":"The meat loaf was very dense without sauce or gravy and the \"mashed potatoes  \". Were not mashed but formed into an over hard ball. Maybe an ice cream scooper.
My wife did not like
 her pasta bolognese but I did.  She said it was lacking pasta.
The space is attractive w/entertainment, so that is a plus.
Spec up the food and we would be happy."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  Really enjoyed the delicious food and appetizers.  The flatiron steak was spot-on and had great flavors.  The bruschetta choices were cool and we tried 3 different types.  They were awesome!  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with friends.  The ambience is very nice and the service is great.  Really enjoyed my hangar steak and shrimp and real mashed potatoes and the vino was superb!  Highly recommend for a nice evening."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I was a big fan of the dumplings. The mac and cheese was thick, cheesy and very filling; the side could be a meal. Very good. Apparently they have half of bottle of wine on Wednesday's. Live music on Friday and Saturday's. We'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"It was fine, the food was a little over priced and the music was blah. Should have been a little more Jazzy not so much a james taylor that had too many beers. All n all it was alright, would'nt go back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Service needs improvement. Bartender was too busy serving guests to help her own table. The food took an abnormally time to come out while other tables continued to be served. My first glass of wine came from a bottle that was opened for too long. When I returned it after one sip they still charged me for it. The chicken I had came out cold and stale like it had been sitting there for hours. I recommend you stay away and try another place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to N Phoenix in late 2013. Discovered this gem 3-4 months later and have eaten here 5-6 times. Food items have been very good to awesome each time. Service has always been friendly and timely.

Last night (Sat 8/16) the place was packed when we arrived around 6:30. Opted to sit at the bar, instead of the patio and glad we did. On the advice of another bar peep, I ordered a half rack of ribs that they had on special. Only mistake I made was not ordering the full rack. They were incredible and their homemade sauce was awesome. My wife had the chicken marsala and raved about it. Our server Kimberli (the bartender) was very attentive, which was amazing as the bar (10-12 seats) was full and she was making drinks for the dining area. Manager Tyler stopped by and introduced himself which was appreciated.

Bottom line is we love this place. Neither of us will ever be called \"foodies\". We simply like good food at a fair price with friendly attentive service. Not much to ask for, but sadly lacking in way to many places. R&W has exceeded our expectations every time. We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place as I've been a fan of their sister establishment, Jalapeño Inferno. But unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment with mediocre food and poor, halting service. Hippy chips sounded much better than a pile of greasy potato chips. Salads we had were small and mundane. Our server closed us out mid-way through because he had to leave and we were left hanging. Overall, by the operations and quality of food, I'd say they're barely holding it together. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"I give this two stars, because my meal was very good (The flatiron steak dish), but service was pretty weak. While we waited for a table, we went to the bar and looked at their fun cocktail list...I ordered a Blueberry Mojito, which sounded good. The bartender started to make it and then told me she had to go in the kitchen to search for some mint....and came back saying that they were out of mint. Ok, not a big deal, but if you are going to have a cocktail list with signature cocktails, maybe you should stock the ingredients!

When we were finally at our table and ordered, it took an hour and 45 minutes to get our food. We asked where our food was after 45 minutes, and they said, \"well one of you ordered the Roast Chicken, and that takes longer.\" Making excuses. Red Flag. Ok fine. Another half hour goes by. Where's our food? Finally we get the manager to come who makes the exact same excuse about the chicken. There is no way that any menu item should take that long without a disclaimer on the menu or a warning from the waitress. Another 30 minutes go by. Hmm....maybe the chicken excuse is just that....an excuse. At this point I am so freaking hungry, that maybe the flatiron was so delicious, because I was completely starving. It's possible. They offered us free dessert, but we didn't want to hang out there any longer."}
{"text":"Local restaurant with a happy atmosphere in a good location. Food is okay but lacking a chef. There is not much flavor. It presents well and is filling. I had chicken and pasta. There was toast on the side that was actually burnt black on one side. If they ever get a chef that cares, this restaurant could be standing room only. This is a gold mine looking for kitchen staff. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this place. Great food (gotta try the French Onion Soup Dumplings), great service, great atmosphere. There are rare rock n roll pieces of art and photography hanging on the walls... and they're for sale. The owner, Terry, knows the historical story behind each photograph of favorites like Grace Slick, Clapton, Hendrix, Lennon, etc. Also, there is excellent music on the whole time and the patio is MASSIVE. They have music there on the weekends... I saw a talented local band called Tramps and Thieves. The food is high-scale but the prices don't reflect it. Both unique culinary pairings and classic items. There are also cool little decorations everywhere. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Nice wine bar with outdoor seating. A good selection of wines along w good wine flights. A nice neighborhood wine bar!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. Wine selection is great. Happy Hour is great. They make a lovely margarita pizza. The bruschetta is delicious. Cheese board was so yummy. They have a wine club as well, so much fun."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon so decided to try this restaurant.  We were greeted with a smile and seated at a nice table.  It was half price bottles of wine on Thursdays, so that was a plus.  Our waiter was very attentive and cordial and our dinner selections were very good.  The banana cream pie was a disappointment.  $8.00 was so overpriced for what we received.  It was overpowered by graham cracker crumbs.  Do not ever order it .... it was a waste of money.  If they have a pastry chef, she/he needs more training.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Rythum & Wine - have only been twice and both times sat on the patio .. which is beautiful at night.  On Sunday Night they had a Yappy Hour and folks had their dogs there - which was an awesome touch.  Food is amazing - I'm not a wine buff by any means but I enjoyed it very much!  Just saw a groupon again for these guys - I will def be purchasing and going again soon!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and time to update the review. Randomly selected this place for lunch due to location- shared these ridiculously good Parmesan crusted potato crisps, delicious Brussels Sprouts Salad and pizza.  Server was attentive and friendly. Super surprise bonus? Buy one bottle of wine get one free..... how can you say no? Return again? Absolutely!"}
