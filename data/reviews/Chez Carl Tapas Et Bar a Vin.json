{"text":"Surprenante petite addition à la poignée de restaurant sur l'île de soeurs.

Les deux fois ou nous sommes allés la salle à manger était vide, mis à part de nous. Pourtant, ce n'est pas parce que la nourriture n'est pas de qualité. Au contraire, le choix de tapas est assez grand (peut-être trop même, puisque les deux fois il y avait des items indisponibles), et varie des entrées chaudes, froides, végé, boeuf, poulet, poisson, fruits de mer, etc. Ouf ! tout un choix. En tout, 3 tapas sont suffisants pour une personne.

Il y a aussi autre chose que des tapas: poulet frit, ribs, poutines et autres plats plus consistants. C'est parce qu'ils ont un fumoir maison... le tout est donc fraîchement préparé, incluant la sauce à poutine. 

Plusieurs choix de boissons alcoolisées (vin, bière, cocktails) et desserts.

Je recommande !!"}
{"text":"What a vice surprise to find this resto tucked away on nuns island. The right rating for this place is probably 3.5 stars but I\"m going to round up as it is a standout for being on Nuns Island. The restaurant is new and has a nice feel. We were a group of 4 so we got to sample a good part of the menu. The standouts were the french onion soup with canard confit, the civiche scallops and some sort of a chocolate caramel dessert. The most disappointing plates were the piri piri cod and the $22 pepperoni and Jamòn Iberico. The ham was cut too thickly and was a bit salty. 

All in all we enjoyed the evening. Would I recommenced trekking across town from the Plateau to eat here, not necessarily. But, if you are in the Verdun/Nuns Island area and in the mood for some tapas Chez Carl is a great option."}
{"text":"So the restaurant Pied a Terre got revamped in Shez Carl Tapas&Vin.  The interior  design change is drastic, strange geometric shapes, red colours on the walls and cosy tables. 
The menu of the new restaurant is impressive, long list of tapas and also few main course options. Good list of wines and by glass choices we enjoyed tasting. The famous french onion soup with duck leg comes in cappuccino cup, a little bit salty, but quite tasty. My favourite tapas were the raviolo and onglet chimichuri (amazing hanger steak with spicy sauce). The baby back ribs were so well advertised by our host for being smoked for hours in the kitchen that we had no other option, but to try them. They go very well with these yummy hot patatas bravas. I'm definitely planning another visit because of the ribs.
I wish there are wine flights offered with the tapas as to combine diverse wine flavours with the extensive food options. May be Carl Chevalier will read this review and add some wine pairing choices to the beautiful menu."}
