{"text":"We all have those BBQ cravings. I have them frequently , and was in the mood. My buddy said this spot was really good and I thought I would give it a try. Wow. I've lived in Arkansas and grew up in the south a bit and had some amazing pulled pork sandwiches and this one was up there. Great flavors and just the right amount of smoke.   Came back about a week later and had the pulled pork again , I know boring but so good. Owner is there in this night and brought out his signature style smoked wings that he prepared \"special \" for me and the boys. I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of wings so to speak. I have to admit , these were probably top five all time and creeping top 3. The smokiness , the perfect amount of sauce and that crispy skin , oh my heavens. Been craving these ever since and I will be going Monday , 6/12/17 lol.   Finally got my wings and they were fantastic. The owners are great and are so kind. Becoming a regular spot for me and a couple friends. Great prices , and always super fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped by looking for a place to eat chicken wings. Ended up getting wings, ribs, and fries. All the Food was on point, ribs super juicy!! Owner is very nice; they treat you just like a mom and pop shop does and really value you as a customer. Will be going back to try the rest of the menu soon!!"}
{"text":"Good food good people  It's that simple..... Go enjoy yourself.... The flavors are unbelievable!!! Try to chicken wing and the shish kabob !!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't take the time to write a review, but I'm making an exception. From reading previous reviews as well as the pictures provided it appears that their food is smoked/grilled. Unfortunately the food I ordered was not and the fries were soggy. The meat had no flavor and seemed to be baked. Very disappointing not to mention the delivery fee is $9.00."}
{"text":"Best BBQ food in Vegas! The wings are the best i ever had! Low prices and the food was delicious, i even ordered food to go! 10/10 reccomend. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Owner is incredible and takes such pride in his food and his customers! Make it over to this place! It's incredible food and their rice and beans are the best! Wow! This is a find!!"}
{"text":"Getting ribs delivered at 1030 for my pregnant wife worth it. Tasted good and fast delivery"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and yelped BBQ. I saw that Mr. Ribs & Mrs.Rice received excellent reviews. My son and I decided to try it and we were not disappointed. The brisket was so tender and juicy, the ribs very meaty and tender. We even had the smoked wings and they were great. The lady who takes your order is extremely pleasant. I would highly recommend the food."}
{"text":"Ok...it's a 'food truck' that has a delivery option. That alone is pretty cool but it gets better.  It was Super Bowl Sunday in Vegas and I was stuck in a conference until after kick off so I was already resigned to being stuck in the Rio hotel for the game. I was worried about a food truck delivering to begin with but the reviews for the food were so good, I wanted to try it. So I ordered while I was sitting in the conference and then went upstairs to watch the game in my room.  The delivery driver called me BEFORE the delivery time that they quoted me which was extra impressive on game day.   So the food...I got the smoked buffalo wings and the 5-bone ribs with fries. I started with the wings and when I opened the box and took a bite of the first one, it was still so (temperature) hot that it burned the top of my mouth. After getting over that, these were some of the best wings I've had. It was different than the traditional fried buffalo-sauced wing, but still close enough that it wasn't like eating a grilled wing. The best of both worlds and delicious!  Next I started on the fries. They were also hit and delicious, but to be honest I didn't want to fill up on fries. That s not the star of the show. So I moved on to the ribs.  So, these ribs weren't exactly like the ribs I'm used to back in North Carolina bbq country, but judging them for what they are 'Las Vegas bbq', they were excellent. The bbq sauce/pan drippings  that they put in the box with it was good. It. It wasn't what I'd call bbq sauce but great nonetheless.  It was probably too much food but that meant I had leftovers for the second half of the game! Ultimately, I was very happy that I chose this instead of the food in the hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered via phone for pick up and told us or will be ready in 20 minutes and it was ready for me to pick up when we arrived. Steaming hout foil pan. The ribs was DELICIOUS and bone came out smoothly. We will be coming back to try rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"You are in deep, deep trouble if you live anywhere near this food truck. You will be back again and again. I had the wings and huge meaty ribs tonight. Man-o-Man. Terrific. Another plus, owners are magnetic."}
{"text":"We had their Ribs, Brisket and Wings let last night and it was amazing . Their ribs and brisket are really tender and was super juicy . The wings on the other hand was smoky tasting and was really crispy . We weren't supposed to order those wings but the owner who was really nice made me and my wife each try it and they were really good . We even had to drive home for about 10 miles and they were still fresh we when got home . ***Prices are better than their competitors .    *** WARNING: RIBS are HUGE !!! Me and my wife order a full rack thinking it would be like an ordinary ribs but we were surprised with what we went home with  LOVE this place and the people that works there !"}
{"text":"The best chicken and sauce I have ever had! Worth the drive. The chicken wings are amazing! The beans they make themselves and they are soooooo good! You must try this food."}
{"text":"I really really liked this place. I ordered the pork ribs (which I usually don't eat beef or pork but it just looked so good) and it came with a full container full (about 6 ribs) and a full container of AMAZING fries. They were those perfectly well done but not too crunchy fries without asking. We also got BBQ wings and they were double the size of Buffalo Wild Wings! Overall 2 entrees and wings were $30 and worth every penny. Also, the people who work there are super nice. Great service, great prices, great food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great people great food. Have been a long time sign company customer and got to taste test many of the meats and side no avail able to everyone - come out and try it - super duper yummy.  Some meats have a twist to the traditional preparation but a very good twist.  Good luck guys"}
{"text":"The food tasted excellent but was not hot due to a traffic jam coming to the caesars palace.   They called and texted me consistently while I waited for my food.   They were very kind and apologetic about something they really couldn't control.  I suggest if you want delivery don't order after 10pm because the crowds be jumping and one small fender bender could mess up the traffic flow and delay your food.  And yes that can happen any time of day.    Also because of security I had to meet the delivery guy outside.  That wasn't bad considering they are still willing to come here even though security doesn't allow them to come in the building.    I must say although the food wasn't hot it was still very good.  I appreciate Mrs. Rice being so patient and helpful even though the situation was out of their control.  And the delivery service was friendly also!     I will definitely order again.  I may just go pick up the food myself next time.  :-)"}
{"text":"Its good truck style bbq, meats well done with lots of flavor, was ready to take a nap after this meal, favorite thing on menu: chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Mike is the best. Period.  Now, with that said, I order here generally every two weeks or so and almost always get the rack of ribs. The meat is tender and juicy and always fresh, never frozen. I think what stands out most for me though, is that Mike, the owner, hops in his car and literally drives the food to my house himself. He is kind, courteous, and as others have already said, passionate about his food and his business.  I only give 4 stars because the delivery process may not always be consistent. Some days he can, and some days he can't. It depends if him or his wife are not busy with other things. But, on the days that he can deliver, the food is great."}
{"text":"Had dinner delivered. Yes I know that is lazy. Driver was at my door in less than 25 minutes which is fantastic.   Order the a full slab of ribs and wings. The ribs are very tasty and exceptionally well done. I really enjoyed them.   The chicken wings were for lunch the next day (so stop calling me a pig). They were nicely done. Flavor seems to be a strong suit for this food truck.   I had a side order of the baked beans. Can't say as I'll order them again. Maybe they shouldn't be considered baked beans. May well be my fault. But overall, I really like them.  Order directly from them and get a $5 discount on the prices. There is enough with one slab of ribs for two people."}
{"text":"I drove by several times before I decided to check this place out- Vegas is not known for having great BBQ, and parking your truck in a lot by a strip club wasn't exactly a ringing endorsement for great eats. But their smoked meats are damn good.  WINGS: 10 big meaty wings for $12. They're smoked for flavor with your choice of sauce. The BBQ + Buffalo combo was a nice spicy-sweet combo that I really enjoyed. I'd get these again as my meal, they were so good. RIBS: Nicely priced at $12 for 5 big thick bones, served with fries. The sauce they use is a little sweeter than I usually prefer but was still pretty good. These ribs were full of flavor and a huge portion size for the price. Very tender, nice pull. BRISKET SANDWICH: THe real test for me, a Texan. I specifically requested a thicker marbled cut, and got it, thankfully. The sando is piled with an ample amount of meat and typically served with sauce and coleslaw, which I got on the side. The meat itself is good and the sandwich held up well with a sturdy pretzel roll bun. I would prefer the option to have white bread, pickles, and onions, but that may just be personal preference.  Pricing is really good for the portion sizes and quality you get, likely because they lack overhead by being a truck. Hours are open late on weekends, and if you call/text ahead you'll get a discount. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yessssss omg i am soooo satisfied with this food THANK YOU THANK YOU. This bbq is VERY good and the customer service was amazing its been a long time since i have been able to actually say that so thank you. I wish i would have taken a pic but i was enjoying my food way to much next time i will post a pic. I almost got food at Jessie Rays bbq i am so glad i did not waste my money there and that i came here to Mr. Ribs & Mrs. Rice. I will be back every time ."}
{"text":"Food truck located in the parking lot of 'Play it Again Sams'.   Met the owner Mike friendly guy who cares about his business.   Ribs were tender sauce is on the sweet side. Rice has nice flavor will be back next time to try more items."}
{"text":"Great food. First time there after driving by numerous times. So I opted to order the ribs side kabob and had a sample chicken wing that was all ohhhhh so tasty. Will be back again. Wings here I come. !!!  Like no other !"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't have a great experience like many others that I see who have posted .  I have driven by here many times since I live near the location and I got a dining offer from Groupon , so I decided to give it a try .  I went last night and ordered 2 pulled pork sandwiches , 5 chicken wings , and a 5 rib plate for me and my 21 year old son .  I figured with the deal I might as well try a bit of this and that .  Well , got home and sandwiches were brisket instead of pork and not very tasty .  My son said it tasted like teriyaki sauce instead of bbq .  The pretzel bun was over toasted almost burnt .  The ribs were soggy like they had been sitting in water all night , not like juicy from being cooked properly .  The wings were good size , but unfortunately cooked just a little too much also .  I would have taken it back to start when I saw we got the wrong sandwiches , but I was too tired from work and after eating one rib and biting the sandwich I was really frustrated .  I go to a lot of bbq places and I am from the South and we love our bbq .  This was one of the worst experiences I have had with a bbq place and spent over $35 for it .  I won't be returning .  I wish it had been better since I live so close ."}
{"text":"This is literally some of the best BBQ I've had in a while. The guy was really nice and really giving and they were fast and the food was great 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork, it was tasty bread was good. Fries were kinda stale & some were kinda good. I liked it but probably won't return. Worth the first try though."}
{"text":"The owner delivered to us at the Golden Tiki. The wings are great and the potato salad is to die for. The place doesn't look like much but they are clean and serve up freshness. The ribs are fall off the bone and finger licking good. We will definitely be back to try the Mediterranean fair."}
{"text":"One sure thing about this 'Food Truck'  Perfect 'hole in the wall'!  Their bbq ribs, 1lb. beef smoked brisket, smoked chicken wings.. TOTALLY WORTH every bite.  This place will be my to go place at least once a week.. maybe twice.  Flavor in every bite!  Don't miss this 'Hole in the Wall Food Truck'"}
{"text":"yummy food, always fresh.  definitely will be back and I will bring my friends.  friendly owners.  keep up the awesome efforts.."}
{"text":"This is the first time i'm writing a yelp review. Me and my girlfriend have been to a lot of ribs and wings places but this is far the best we've been to. The ribs are so tender and juicy and the sauce is a perfect. On the other hand the spicy chicken wings is so good my girlfriend ate it using her hands. I've never seen her do that! All the food we've tried is really good and the owners Nadia and Mike are the nicest. They gave us samples of the brisket which is smoked for 18 hours and it's also very tender and juicy and it literally melt in your mouth. They showed us how they smoke their chicken wings and the smell is so good that even though i'm already full it made my stomach rumble. We also tried a little bit of their rice and ot has a buttery flavor. The owners are really passionate with what they do and they were really happy for us liking the food.   Everybody should try this place. It is for sure one of the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from EAT24 by Yelp (its 105 outside). Order came within 25 minutes-5* delivery rating. Plenty of food for 2-4 people. Since there were 2 of us-we have leftovers.  Ordered: Pork Ribs: 5* fall off the bone delicious and meaty! Brisket Sandwich-3* much smaller in portion than the picture depicts..maybe due to delivery? Was just ok a bit dry. Chicken Wings: 5* way better than any fried wing drowned in sauce...you could even eat them plain! Potato Salad: 3* though many people love, I found it to be heavily seasoned with what I believe is cilantro and I leave that for my Mexican food. Really a matter of taste in this one. Cucumber Salad: 4* again, matter of taste and I think it needed a wee bit more seasoning. Fries: 5* crisp l, hot, well seasoned and didn't look like they were the last of the barrel :-) Overall an excellent choice for BBQ and I highly recommend! One thing they are missing to completely absolve me from the kitchen and grill mess associated with serving up a good old fashioned BBQ dinner-corn on the cobb...goes great on a grill-maybe an addition to the menu?"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say, for sure top 3 best wings I've had, the meat literally falls of the bone. Next time I visit Vegas, I'm definitely coming back for more wings. BBQ & Buffalo sauces ask for the wings to be extra wet."}
{"text":"I live in Chinatown and drive past the plethora of unique eateries every day as I cruise down Spring Mountain. Among all of the Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese restaurants, there are a few non-Asian gems such as Rincon de Buenos Aires and Urban Crawfish Station. When I spotted Mr. Ribs & Mrs. Rice recently in a Gentleman's Club parking lot, I was cautiously excited. My family and I often get powerful barbecue cravings, and that usually means a journey north to Famous Dave's.   The fire engine red BBQ trailer setup is very eye catching, and I couldn't wait to check it out. Glad I did! After reading the mostly positive Yelp reviews, I made up my mind to give it a go on a Friday night. I could see from the inclusion of Mediterranean menu items that this wasn't a case of a Memphis, Kansas City or Austin transplant setting up shop with their family recipes in Vegas. I am Greek American, so I kinda figured that this was instead a case of a talented immigrant restaurateur applying their skills towards a popular American cuisine like you see all the time in my home town of New York. The owner Mike is a super friendly guy, and you can see that he has put a ton of passion and hard work into this venture. The result is a culinary home run.   I ordered a full rack of St Louis style ribs, a medium size order of jumbo wings, and the potato salad. Mike kindly threw in an order of french fries on the house. The young women that work for him are super friendly, and the fare is absolutely delicious. The quality of the ingredients, the recipes, the slow-cook technique and the very fair prices make this a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and I will return often. So glad to have top notch American style barbecue in the neighborhood! I would also consider them as a terrific catering option."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas during the Rock n Roll marathon and ordered on the night the strip was closed down. The food came late but did not disappoint. Delicious!!!! Ribs and brisket were amazing! Highly recommend. Driver kept us updated through text and Mike called us to ask how we wanted the large order packaged- we had a large order for 5 people. Definitely eating here next time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered online, which was very easy, but FYI the menu on Yelp is different than through other websites (ex. We paid a few bucks more to order x2 of chicken wings bc it had only 5pc option, but we later saw a 10pc on a different menu that bf found online). Our food wasn't ready according to the estimated time but it was no big deal. I didn't catch the guy's name, but he was very nice. He apologized and hurried to get our order prepared. The ribs were 4 stars: tender and fell off the bone (I'm completely a Phil's BBQ fan) but the wings were the best I've had in town. Cucumber salad was nice and fresh after all the meaty goodness. Bf enjoyed the fries. Potato salad I would give 3.5 stars only bc it had too much black olives which made it too salty for my personal taste. Good BBQ for a food truck. Will return."}
{"text":"Best spot in Vegas is no joke. If you love pulled pork cooked 18 hours and some of the best smoked chicken wings I have ever tasted.. Must try!   Love my BBQ     HAVE TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!    Ask them for Mikes Style Sauce on the wings!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"First time to try this place out. It was 930pm sooo last minute to try a new place for food. Let me just say the brisket was sooo juicy and meaty it melt in your mouth. The rice was a little dry and beans were flavorful and ordered the potatoe salad which was sooo fluffy and yummy! I def will be back to try their ribs (they sold out) pulled pork sandwich and wings. Definitely try this food truck - DON'T KNOCK UNTIL YOU TRY IT"}
{"text":"Take my money!!!! Nicest business ever, BOMB ass chicken wings. Affordable prices for the quality, get then potato salad, it's probably my favorite thing I got here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was a huge disappointment! It's not a pulled pork at all.. .just a slice of pork with lots of fats in it! How can one call it a pulled pork if it's not?! Flavor is nothing special. I would not recommend this food truck. Better you spend your money at a real bbq restaurant."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here on Postmates for the first time. Ordered the brisket with a side of potato salad and BBQ beans. The beans were a little spicy but tasty, and I didn't like the mashed potatoes at all which was a bummer. Brisket was good though, just would've preferred more BBQ sauce especially since it's extra. I'll have to try the wings next time."}
{"text":"Literally the best wings you'll ever have. Wow. The BBQ/Buffalo sauce they use is a must. And the habanero special sauce is enough to heat to melt your tongue. Been here two days in a row and can tell you they exceed expectations every time!"}
{"text":"Food made me Sick.   I ordered online. Then found out after I ate it... It's a roach coach (food truck) next to a strip club.  You're eating strip club food. Nasty!   The meats are saturated in Gluten and Monosodium Glutamate marinade. Of course, if you ask,  the owner will pretend not to know what Gluten or MSG is.   Absolutely disgusting food."}
{"text":"Hands down, best bbq spot in Vegas. Holy cow this is AMAZING! And for the price, you can't beat it. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I will now forever always return to this place."}
{"text":"I respect this business. Customer service was fantastic but the food was just ok. Tried this place because of the Groupon discount. Ordered the chicken wings in honey bbq, the chicken was crispy and cooked just right. Also ordered the chicken kebab, now that was undercooked. I may try it again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So good! They deserve 5 stars, great service and spectacular food.   It's a food truck located on the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn Rd (China town), across from Bank of America and in the same lot as the gentleman's club. Not the best location but it's a convenient spot and easy to find and park.  I was kindly greeted and quickly ordered. After finding out it was my first visit was offered a few samples. I tried a chicken wing and it was so good, the best I've ever had! The taste in my mouth had my anxious to get home and eat my meal. No chance for photos I scarfed it so fast.   I can't wait to go back and try the cucumber salad and more wings. Love the late hours and quality of everything. Try them out!"}
{"text":"What a great find this is, gotta try the Ribs the chicken wings are so amazing. The beef brisket is a work of art. If you love bbq this is a must try.   Welcome to the best of the best !!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Pulled pork was amazing. For being in a box truck and it being 112 degrees outside the food was very good. Didn't care for the potato salad or cole slaw on the pulled pork sandwich but the pulled pork and bun were super delicious. Best pulled pork in Vegas."}
{"text":"So many places to choose from, read the reviews and thought I'd give this a try.  It was wonderful!  Very moist, not too much sauce and you taste the  flavor of the meat.  Friendly and informative people, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! We called ahead of time and something went wrong with our order but it was worth the drive"}
{"text":"The best brisket in town (12 hour cook) the guy is a good guy and will deliver to my favorite bar. A must have"}
{"text":"The wings weren't bad. I came shortly before close. The guy had a great attitude, was helpful with my selection and shared some fries out the bowl with me he had left over.  It's right in Chinatown so the scenic driving to and from on the main road are pretty dope.   I don't eat pork so i might not make it back there, but I'd definitely recommend if you wanted something soulful in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice guys, good ribs. Nuff said"}
{"text":"Are you afraid of flavor? Then stay away from this humble little trailer.   I dined here for lunch with my girlfriend while we were out running errands. I had a half rack of ribs and they are by far the best I have ever tasted. They are smoked for 7-8 hours, perfectly tender. I had nothing left but clean bones!!  The sauce on the outside was sweet and peppery with a little tang to offset the rich smoke flavor.   My girlfriend had the brisket and it was deliciously tender as well.  We also shared a side of potato salad(with kalamata olives) and nice fluffy long grain rice. If you love BBQ you HAVE to try this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the parking lot of Play It Again Sams but it shouldn't be hidden from your dining experiences! Most amazing bbq around and I've tried them all (Jessie Rays, Rollin Smoke, etc). One unique thing these guys do right is their smoked chicken wings. Not only is their food great but the customer service is top notch too. I had a two month break from this joint and they remembered my face! I'll be coming back here for as long as they're in this location, then I'll have to sniff them out on Twitter!"}
{"text":"Hidden jems are my favorite and this one didn't disappoint! My boyfriend has been coming here for awhile and I finally got to experience the amazing customer service from the owner himself. Now onto the food, it is made to order and is more full of flavor than your typical BBQ spots, it must be a secret family recipe in combination with smoking all their meats.   Pros:   -Flavor  -Customer Service  -Fast Service   Cons:   -It's a food truck so don't plan on coming here to dine, you'll need to take it to go."}
{"text":"Wow great wings and ribs , I was very much so impressed and it's got a different kind of flavor to it nice service nice staff however the girls weren't real happy , but they're just picky anyway and they just wanted McDonald's I do believe the only thing keeping it from five stars is the fact my food got thrown away instead of boxed..."}
{"text":"Found this food truck in the heart China town. The guy running it was super friendly and provided fast and excellent service. Food was as delicious as it looked!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was excellent! The smoked wings were pretty big and very tasty! The ribs were cooked just right and had a pretty good balance of rub/ sauce."}
{"text":"The food truck is located next to a gentlemans club lol. Ordered the #6 from the guy. He was very friendly. I was craving ribs. The fries were delicious and perfectly cooked. The ribs were tender and soft. It fell right off the bone. I would come back here to try the wings when I get the chance. Their chicken looked really good."}
{"text":"Shout out Mr. Ribs.   Sauce is outstanding, I'm definitely coming back, he said he has the hangover sauce too. Just a few wings and you back in action.    #supportindependentownedbusiness"}
{"text":"I saw this place many times, but always felt spectacle to try it out. After seeing so many good review on Yelp and other delivery apps, My sis and I finally got a chance to try it out. The owner is super nice. We ordered the full rack of ribs and wings, it took quite awhile and he offer us some fries while we wait. It was so good we ended up ordered one home as well LOL.  The ribs and wings were delicious like what others said, so we will definitely come back again for more!"}
{"text":"Not worth my money . First n last time I'll purchase any item . Just bland no flavor or seasoning , hardly any coleslaw with my meal"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas to watch the Canelo vs GGG fight. Stayed in a very nice hotel. We wanted BBQ but couldn't BBQ our selves in our room. We ordered take out from Mr. Ribs and Mrs. Rice. It was our first time ordering with them. They only had a few hours notice for the food we ordered. We ordered 2 full Slabs of ribs, lots of chicken wings, rice, beans etc. they delivered everything including plates, forks etc. to our hotel. Very friendly, fast service and very tasty fall off the bone ribs and chicken wings. All finger licking good. I highly recommend them. I will be ordering again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Rice is so delicious especially if you like spicy. Owner is super nice. This is definitely our new go to spot when in town."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your money here the food is terrible and so are the people that run this roach coach! They're rude and the good will make you sick. Honestly just don't !! Don't eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"The bbq at this Food Truck restaurant was delicious. I had the 10 piece smoke wings and the kabob steak and veggies. And the owner or customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a convention and tired of hotel food? THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! Quick delivery I could track with EAT24 app!   Thank you for a great BBQ dinner of Ribs & pulled pork sandwich.  Loved the cucumber salad too!!   When we come back we are calling on y'all again!!"}
{"text":"Nice little truck outside Gentlemans Club. Prime location. Customer service provided by the owner. I ordered 20 wings 1/2 Bbq and 1/2 Plain. They were pretty tasty along with their select sauces. Think theyre previously grilled then flash fried in deep fryer. Ill be back"}
{"text":"Been eyeing this place for awhile. So glad I finally got to order from here and the food was great. I ordered the brisket sand which. It had the perfect amount of meat on the bun. The fries were nice and crisp as well. Only thing is I wish there was a little more sauce on the bun, or maybe I should have ordered extra sauce. Will most likely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"My son order number three I ordered number six ribs and fry so tender it just come off the bone"}
{"text":"Upgraded to 4 stars, I complained here without contacting the manager first. He called and made a good-faith effort to make it right, which is all we can ask. I'd give them another try, since the overall experience was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Kabobs, wings, brisket sandwich are all legit. BBQ is easy to mess up, this spot definitely surpassed my expectations. Right in China Town. Get delivery!! Driver with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Lovely Woman!! The food was Great!!  Incredible Kabobs Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo Much Flavor and Juicy!! Thank you for the sample wings see ya soon!!"}
{"text":"This food truck is incredible! Ribs are tender and meat falls off the bone. Pulled pork is out of this world. Wings will knock your socks off! The sauce is a BBQ/Buffalo mix, yum!"}
{"text":"Had the ribs and smoked wings. Both were very good. Remember it's a food truck with an outdoor dining room consisting of two plastic chairs a table and exhaust fumes from other cars waiting for their carry out orders. It's designed mostly for carry out. Will try other BBQ places next but would not hesitate to comeback."}
{"text":"i always wanted to try this place but always end up being close since im a busy person but tonight was the night i was able to catch this place open, text my order since they offer got to the place and very friendly and welcoming type of person, let me sample the chicken without the bbq and flavor is already good but with bbq it top it off.. The full rack ribs i had was good nice tasty and just how i like to eat my ribs.. Thanks Mike and i will coming back when i crave for the bbq.. I recommend this spot if you want some Ono grindz.."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I ordered to have it delivered and after 45 minutes the delivery driver contacted me to pass on the fact that they had to cook more ribs and it would be another 45 minutes. I have to eat before 7pm otherwise I am up in the middle of the night and this made me eat late that night and I wasn't too happy that the restaurant itself never contacted me to apologize for making my 45 minute wait into nearly 2 hours. I am guessing that it is better to order and eat there. Not sure if I will give a second chance or not."}
{"text":"This food is amazing!!! Owner is super friendly and you can tell he loves what he is doing!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the food especially coming from a food truck. I usually don't like to go to food trucks bc of cleanliness issues and smells coming from certain ones. This one did not disappoint. The owner Mike was very accommodating the food came out quick and was piping hot the price was good for the portions. We ate every single bite and for your entertainment it's conveniently located in the parking lot of a gentlemen's club.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"One of the better bbq joints I've been to! The owner is such a lovely character and it shows in his food! The brisket was melt in your mouth good with lots of flavor. Same with the ribs - they practically fall off the bone as you bite into them!   Also just fyi, the truck is parked in the lot of a strip club - so you can eat your ribs while watching seedy characters go in and out of the club :p"}
{"text":"I got the 10 smoked wings and fries it totaled out to 15.57 pretty pricey for some chicken and fries . The wings were good and he fries were fresh they definitely had to much salt , the owners were friendly but, I'd suggest getting more sauce options like regular bbq ,mild, and spicy they tried to accommodate me by mixing bbq and buffalo sauce but it just didn't give me what I was looking for ,I'd go there again"}
{"text":"In search for BBQ wings we found this little gem in Chinatown! We were greeted with friendly smiles and the lady made sure we were taken care of. She made sure the fries were crispy just the way I like them. I was really happy since most places salt their fries way too much but they didn't. We got 20 smoked chicken wings and it was to die for. Forget Wingstop and Buffalo Wild Wings!! This place has much better wings with less oil and greasiness. The wings has a smoked flavor so you don't even need to put any flavoring. All you need is ranch and their barbecue dipping sauce. Seriously try their wings it's satisfying."}
{"text":"I really do not know how this place has high stars. Maybe they're having an off day? But I won't be ordering from this place again. Spent about $60 only to have thrown away everything except the rack of ribs that I'm tolerating to eat so I'm not COMPELTELY wasting everything. Let's start from the beginning. Anyone who knows me at all knows the love I have for ribs. I've seen this place a lot and today my cravings for ribs were so strong I had to try it, see what all these reviews are talking about. The little sauces in the little containers were $1 each lmao. Come on now ???  First thing I noticed The BBQ chicken plate was a MESS.  The rice looked WEIRD, like it didn't belong in the plate! Not fresh rice perhaps? And the taste??? SOUR. I'm not even going to bring up the beans.  Second thing I noticed The \"potato salad\".......... They should really call it ONION SALAD because the ONE BITE I took made me VOMIT. The ONLY thing I tasted was ONIONS. As if I bit into one.   And lastly. The rack of ribs. I ordered honey bbq ribs. Tasted more sour than sweet. It was not fall off the bone and that was the biggest disappointment.  to each it's own. I'm glad I tried it with just my husband and I, before my family came up & I recommended this place for all of us. They would've been disappointed in me. Lol.   It's so hard to find a good BBQ & island food place out here. Nothing beats the food places in Hawaii  food made with LOVE & ALOHA can never go wrong. Maybe do a survey & test your food with random people to better your cooks."}
