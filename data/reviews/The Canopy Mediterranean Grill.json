{"text":"While the decor is very nice in keeping with the Historic bldg it is in, the service is horrible.  The food was tasty, but the lack of service ruined it for us."}
{"text":"the food was pretty absolutely delicious and that is the only reason i am giving it a two star. On the other hand, the service was pretty awful. I had this heavy set Mexican lady as my server, and she recommended cabernet as a \"sweet wine\". Last time i checked, cabernet is dry. She also barely came to my table and dropped off the check without asking if i was done."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service. Highly recommend and definitely be back.  Cozy dinning friendly atmosphere great appetizers and entrees"}
{"text":"Usually restaurants at hotels are a let down. But the canopy Mediterranean grill is an exception. All the food I had tasted great with freshness on top. The hummus and pita was a great starter followed by the 14oz ribeye. Washed down with a glass of Merlot, this place has great food and great service."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated - as my dining partner commented, \"I don't feel like I'm in Cleveland!\"  Great lighting and decor on the second floor of the gorgeous new Doubletree Tudor Arms Hotel near CWRU and University Circle.  Our server, Julie, was extremely friendly, and the bar scene and booths were hopping.  We each ordered a glass of the Lebanese Cabernet Sauvignon - tasty - followed by Greek and spinach salads.  The dressing on both was superb and the portions were healthy.  We will go back and sample some of the fabulous-looking Hummous and Tabbouleh.  Definitely a find for Cleveland, and free valet parking!  Go!"}
{"text":"The Canopy Mediterranean Grill is a convenient and reasonably-priced choice for anyone staying at the Tudor Arms Hotel. Service was a tad slow, but friendly. 

I ordered a shish kabob (beef) wrap, which also came with a heaping pile of fries. The beef cubes were tender, but could have been seared on the outside for more flavour. The wrap was still tasty, and I'll likely stop there again if I stay at the Tudor Arms in the future."}
{"text":"This was a nice quiet place to sit while my husband had a back procedure across the street. I had the combo platter and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Ordered Shrimp Cocktail and Lamb Chops. Food arrived fast and was great. Only negative was menu said 6 jumbo shrimp and it was actually 5 medium shrimp. Other than that everything was great. I will definitely drop back in next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a restaurant in a hotel.  This Doubletree by Hilton restaurant has excellent staff - friendly & efficient. Menu choices are decent if limited, especially the appetizers. It does have a good wine selection - and bar service to take drinks to the room.  Overall, though reasonably priced, it's a pretty pedestrian eatery."}
{"text":"Cool little bar /restaurant in the Tudor Arms Double Tree.  First, the food is really good.  I had a couple different meals and each was really tasty.  They have a great selection of drinks and TV's to watch the game.   Only draw back is it's a bit pricey, but as I said it quality food.  I'd say worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"I simply like this place.  Great food and extremely pleasant staff that will take the time to visit with you.   The are independent of the hotel but work closely with them.  Three meals this week and I have walked away happy and content each time."}
{"text":"Normally I don't go to hotel restaurants, but I was just to lazy to venture out after a full day of traveling so I took a chance and I am pleased I did.  The place was busy so I sat at the bar and ordered the fattoush salad (really good).  The bartender assured me the salad was authentic, made by a Syrian cook.  That was the first time I had a fattoush salad and now it is one of my favorites.  I also ordered crushed lentil soup (was ok) it was a light liquid soup rather than a hearty soup.  A good combo to not feel miserably full after the meal.  They had several vegetarian items which was appreciated.  
Overall, very good for hotel food and good decor. Wait staff very nice and I met some other business travelers who helped make the evening enjoyable.

I will be staying at the hotel again and will dine at this hotel restaurant again."}
{"text":"Service a little slow, only two of four taps operational. Ordered a burger and fries I believe the burger was a frozen one and the fries were not crispy. Waitress was nice and really working hard in a crowded area."}
{"text":"Look out Cleveland. This place is a great refuge for tasty middle Eastern food.  Fantastic lamb, fatoush, baba ganouj , salads. Attentive service, good bar with some local draughts.  Best little hotel bar and restaurant in my recent travels.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to the place a few days back . Very good experience. The server was very attentive and my order came up in like 15-20 min. I ordered a pizza n a pasta and both were  quite  good. The ambience is good as well !!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because the menu looked great but it was super disappointing. I went with a big group of people and we were the only people eating in the restaurant. It was empty and now I know why. To start the service was not very good. I understand we were a large party but getting refills on our drinks should not have been as hard as it was. Once the food was served the waiter was MIA. For being the only people in the place it took way too long for our food to be prepared... overall the service just subpar. I ordered the chicken Marsala and the first few bites were great ! Then after three bites I noticed hair in my chicken. I couldn't even tell the waitress about it until the dinner was over because she didn't come back after the food was served. I ended up splitting a salad with my friend sitting next to me. When the waitress picked up our plates she asked why I didn't eat my chicken and when I explained to her that there was hair in my food she was very apologetic and took it off the bill. I'm glad she was sorry for what had happened but it would have been nice to have proper service and had a proper meal for dinner instead of an apology once the dinner was over.


UPDATE: The owner of the restaurant messaged me after I received a disturbing message from one of the employees about my review. I screenshot the message I received and she was quick to respond after I sent it to her. She, unlike her employees, is very professional. Unfortunately I can not go back and try the food after the terrible experience to update my review because I just wouldn't feel comfortable."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

Located inside the Hilton Tudor Arms. The Canopy Mediterranean Grill is an Oasis in a desert of Food choices. As in there aint many places around if your hungry at night.

Bonus points for open late. The people here were so chill that we arrived 10 minutes before closing and still served us with smiles.....that is great.

Food is pretty good: Pita sandwiches are the kind you would get from a food truck. Fries were great. Prices are reasonable.

{"text":"Great food. Great service. My husband had a doctors apt across the street at Cleveland clinic. We arrived the night before. Someone recommended this place. It's inside the double tree hotel. For starters we had the appetizers of humus, tabula and eggplant) with pita squares. Then a Greek salad. Main course was the Greek chicken. Very reasonable prices. Would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Grosss i will never ever eat there again!!!

Pizza looks like butchers daughter , tastes even worst! Yuk"}
{"text":"We drove from NY on the backend of a Colorado road trip. We were in Cleveland visiting the Rock and Roll hall of Fame and we're staying at the Doubletree!!  I had the shrimp cocktail, which was very fresh!!! Caesar salad was crisp and had some toasted Mediterranean bread!!  Main course was the pork chop with a unbelievable gravy.  My wife had the fettocino Alfredo  and she couldn't stop eating it!!!  The house wine was great!!! They even had IPA from Colorado, New Belgium Fat tire!!!  Staff was great!!!"}
{"text":"Really slow service. They're really nice but don't come here if you're in a hurry. Cappuccino was good. We only ate desserts and they were tasty. Piece of cheesecake was $9 and so was a crown and coke. We're from Missouri and that is an insane amount to pay for both of those. Maybe not here? But that's crazy to us."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Slow service. Only convenient because it's attached to the Tudor Arms Doubletree hotel."}
{"text":"Low key hotel bar. The drinks were as expected and the prices were typical for a hotel bar. Nothing fancy or \"exceptional\". However the bartenders were very nice and willing to give us recommendations for around town."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great ambiance--it doesn't get better than this.

I've had the pleasure of dining at Canopy several times. I like how you can choose between ordering a bunch of tapa style plates to share with the table, or if you don't enjoy sharing, you can get your own meal. The falafel is unbeatable!! I can't comment much on the meat dishes because I'm a veggie, but from what I heard they are fantastic as well. The dessert is also a huge stand out--baklava is a MUST!

As for the service, the waiters and managers have been nothing but polite and pleasant. They really take care of you!!

The space itself is very calming, nicely decorated and has tons of potential as a place to rent for parties and large events. I definitely think there should be a Yelp event here!

It's conveniently located in the DoubleTree hotel, so guests staying there shouldn't miss out on this great dining experience! It's also right next to the Cleveland Clinic, so I'd highly recommend this place for out of towners as well.

I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Arriving at a hotel in Cleveland on a Sunday night, I didn't expect to find the hotel restaurant to be still open at 10 pm, let alone to find that it specialized in Lebanese cuisine. The biggest surprise was that the food was truly excellent. After years of reading menu descriptions and recipes that described the eggplant in baba ghanoush as having a \"smoky flavor\", I have finally tasted the smoky flavor! It was by far the best baba ghanoush I have ever had. The pita bread that accompanied it was incredibly chewy. The shish tawook (chicken kabob) was also superlative. The chicken pieces were deliciously marinated and perfectly cooked, as were the accompanying red peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini. I realize that my descriptions are not doing this dish justice, but all I can say is that everything had a subtly delicious grilled/roasted flavor. Finally, I must mention that the service was both incredibly friendly and professional. Overall, food here compares very favorably to the middle eastern food that you find in the SF Bay Area."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how to rate this.  On one hand I loved the food and drink, on the other hand the service and atmosphere sucked, hence why I ended up going to the middle and giving it an average rating.

The Pro's:  Wonderful wine.  Amazing food.  My mother and I both got wines- her's a merlot, mine a moscato- and steak- her a ribeye and myself the kabob.  Everything tasted wonderful.  I felt the food was a bit on the pricey side, but we were a) in a Hilton, and b) in the city, so...

The Con's:  I didn't like the atmosphere at all.  It just didn't feel like fine dining or a \"lounge\" as the waitress called it.  A lounge doesn't have a bunch of tv's.  A lounge is low lighting, quiet, and a place you can just sit and relax for a few hours.  This was not.  Sorry.  The decor didn't know what it was doing.  It was somewhat cluttered and the color palette was every which way.  Just nothing about the space made sense.

That can be forgiven.  What can't be forgiven is the crappy service.  Firstly when I asked her recommendation on a sweet wine, I was told merlot.  Ehm, now I don't know a ton about wine, but I do know merlots are dry as the desert because that's what my mom always drinks.  So I ended up having to google their wines to find a sweet one.  I ended up going with the moscato- which again was amazing- but it was rather crap that the waitress had no freaking clue when you have a fairly large wine list and are in a wine drinking area.  Fail.  Also, her personality sucked and she didn't really check on us.  When we asked for boxes it took her forever to come with them.  In fact it took her forever to even come back to take our order.  Not attentive at all.

Overall, if I was staying in the hotel again I would go back but only because of how good the food was.  Although considering that they offer room service on the same menu, I'd probably just order up to avoid the crap service and atmosphere.  The rooms are much nicer to look at and wouldn't even have to go anywhere to enjoy my wonderful steak and wine in peace."}
{"text":"Wait staff are attentive. Drinks are about average price. I can't speak for the food itself, but the portions I saw were huge! The next time I'm in Cleveland, I will come here again!"}
{"text":"Quack!

Ate here a couple times staying at the Tudor Arms. Greek/Mediterranean items were good, but other items were blah. The servers were very nice but the kitchen was HELLA slow. It took them 50 minutes to make a shrimp scampi!Not to mention it wasn't even busy. I could tell the server felt bad, but still, it shouldn't take that long for a simple pasta (wouldn't recommend the scampi, falafel was better). Again, the service was really good, so for that I would pop back in for a drink or small bite, but I probably wouldn't go back again for dinner. 

Food - 3/5
Service 5/5
Speed 1/5

Quack!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Hilton Tudor Arms. The Canopy Mediterranean Grill is a cozy place for a good meal. I ate here twice while on a business trip, and the first night was excellent. The waitress was great and so was my combo plate of a hummus platter and stuffed grape leaves. I also enjoyed the local Great Lakes Brew. The second night was not so good as there were different people working. Hit-or-miss perhaps, but I think this place is worth a shot for a good meal."}
{"text":"OMG, never experienced such uncaring attitude at a restaurant.  I ordered a double espresso.  First of all it was watery.  Second, it was $10!!!!  I would have never ordered it if I had been told of the exorbitant cost. Food was greasy and bitter.  I could go on, but have better things to do."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that that my husband calls me Gordon Ramsay. I am brutal when the food or service is bad. 
This is a beautiful little place, friendly and helpful staff, and amazing food. 
We ordered the sample plate with Baba ghanoush, hummus, tabbouleh, and pitas and I had the crab cakes off of the specials menu. The babaganouj was our favorite-- very flavorful and quite obviously homemade. 
The crab cake was especially good. My husband and I were discussing how this restaurant was in a hotel, so the crab cakes were probably small and frozen. Nope. Decently sized, and again, quite obviously homemade, and SO flavorful. The chef even made rounds to see if we were enjoying our meal. 
Definitely happy that we decided to take the trek downstairs. :-)"}
{"text":"This restaurant, one of the few in the Cleveland Clinic area, really stood out as a great meal option. The menu is large, and the food was high quality.

I'd say check out the Shish Tawook - great flavors in the chicken. The Kibbe fried and hummus were also above average. I found the lentil soup and falafel to be just average.

They do not deliver outside the Tudor Arms Hotel, so don't be thrown off!"}
