{"text":"Good place for a burger with the family, though expensive, and can be slow. Beet salad is good as are the burgers and fries with Parmesan."}
{"text":"Okay I had a major hangover.
Okay I was also hungry.
Okay I'm no hamburger connoisseur.

But I thought the burger I had here today was THE BEST EVERRR.
Patty was thick and SO juicy.  And the bread was super soft with a hint of crusty edges that just killed it.

EVERRR."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about The Rude Boy. Delicious burgers, delicious parm fries, tasty soda (or beer, if that is your wont), and a good overall dining experience. Like a lot of places, this joint delivers a \"gourmet burger\" which means \"gourmet prices\", but it's pretty much worth the money. My wife has had a couple of experiences here in which she asked them for her burger to be well done, and it came back too pink for her liking. They do tend to undercook the meat, if I'm going to make any complaint at all. (I guess I don't have have \"nothing\" but good things to say, but it's mostly good things.)

I will be going back to The Rude Boy for another round. I've also had their fish and chips, which were a gastronomic delight. If you like burgers, you should probably check it out, too."}
{"text":"Pros: Good burgers, Nice atmosphere.
Cons:  Lunch cost me $24. Burger, Fries and a coke. The burger includes a quarter of a pickle and 4 burnt chips. Fries are extra.  A discounted lunch menu would help capture the business crowds a block away. Too pricey for a regular place to eat for lunch. Pabts blue ribbon.... need I say more? 
Other stuff:  A visible menu could help. Especially from the street. 

 I am sure its cool at night as a hangout bar but I will not go back for lunch since it is pricey and I am tired of eating burgers...."}
{"text":"The best burgers in Toronto according to ZAGAT, mmmm They are good quality but not the best in town."}
{"text":"best burgers ive had, and delicious fries however im giving this 4 stars because i dont like how dark it is inside as well as how odd and hipster this place is... will be coming back but only for take out"}
{"text":"Burgers were good but nothing mind blasting"}
{"text":"5 Star Rude Boy! Great Burger. Nice attentive staff. My water glass was rarely empty and she poured my Stiegl into a pint glass like a gentlelady. I had the Rudeboy Burger.
We're talking Burger - back bacon - home smoked slice bacon - fried egg - cheese - onions. This burger is meant for hairy chests and woman with nicknames like \"Large Marge\". All I have to say is it was a complex thing of beauty!  

Guys & Gals...

Don't listen to the haters out there... Give a hater an outlet like yelp and they might as well quite their day job and hate all day...

Like the guy who complained about slipping.... Learn to walk buddy.

I think the prices have dropped from some of the earlier posts, I've read.

Foods great - Clientele chill. And the music...... Who doesn't love \"The Specials\" and 80's ska!"}
{"text":"Now THAT is a tasty burger! I would highly recommend the Rude Boy to the burger aficionados of the city. The decor leaves something to be desired but the perfectly cooked burgs and kimchi fries totally make up for it for those a little cosmetically inclined.

Ordered:

Sting burger
Natural burger
Kimchi fries
Pints 

Tons of food for two people

I was a little surprised to not see anything Jamaican on the menu with a name like Rude Boy but maybe I'm culturally confused..."}
{"text":"Just came for the onion rings. They were too batter-y, overly greasy and sometimes it was just taking a bite of a big chunk of salt because I think they didn't season it properly? Disappointed."}
{"text":"Best burgers I have ever had in my life. Plus they use grass fed beef which is a huge bonus. So excited to find somewhere that used kimchi other than a Korean spot. Kimchi fries are delish"}
{"text":"The only suggestion I would make would be  a bit brighter lighting. Burgers, fish and chips were awesome.  Great service! Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Favourite burger in town.

The kimchi fries are delicious.

Kinda pricier than I normally would want in a burger but tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place represents everything that is wrong with dining in new jack pseudo hip Toronto. The service staff are inconsiderate, seeming to feel that because they play cool music and have funky furniture, that this will take care of the rest. We cannot eat music or furniture. The burgers themselves are very average, come on bad buns, and are assembled by charlatan \"chefs\" who care as little about their assembly of burgers as they do about their personal hygiene.

A sad little restaurant, happy resting on it's dubious merits, while it still has so much to prove. In the pantheon of Toronto burgers it deserves no mention. Luckily, they are closed a lot. It is the epitome of an overpriced, under delivering craft burger place. Rude Boy makes you want to walk five minutes up the road to the Macdonald's in the train station. It is bad on every level, yet they seem inexplicably proud of themselves."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this establishment first because it was open late.  Then after I took the first bite...I have to go back every month.   Its a great recipe and continue to crave it. I love the egg on the burger!!!!"}
{"text":"Frequent customer, definitely the best burgers in the neighbourhood.  Juicy burgers, with a little seasoning that just melt in your mouth.

The Seoul Man (Kimchi on a burger?  Yes, please!) is probably my favourite.  The Stinger is also pretty solid too.  Their house made ketchup is fantastic if you're ordering parm-fries, just make sure to ask for a second side of ketchup.

This place combines a casual atmosphere with some great staff.  I almost always sit at the bar and am seldom left waiting more than a moment to give my order, or get another beverage.

They have Stiegl in cans, and an awesome cocktail selection.

Bit of a weird mix of awesome high end cocktails in a burger joint, but still a cool place to go for a bite, or have a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"consistently juicy and imaginative burgers make me want to go back time after time (although the beer tap remains understated, but I've learned to stick to tall-boy cans)"}
{"text":"Love this neighbourhood spot for burgers and beers but the buns are always super stale.  I can see them sitting there, plastic wrapped, in a bus bin (not a good look), and it bums me out. 
Xx - Burger lover"}
{"text":"My advice? Skip Rude Boy. I'm a fan of limited menus - do one thing and do it well philosophy, etc. You would think with a small menu such as Rude Boy's, they'd be excellent at what they do. Sadly, not. Bland bland bland burger. The usual substandard iceberg lettuce and underwhelming refrigerated tomato. Triple cooked fries... to what effect I do not know. Grated parmesan on them should have helped. Didn't. What really astounds me is this. There are lots of great burgers in Toronto. Dedicated burger joints (Holy Chuck, Burger Priest) and restaurants with great burgers (the burger at Marben on Wellington is truly memorable). Surely the proprietors of Rude Boy have tasted some of these delicious burgers, have compared them to Rude Boy's offerings and... have thought 'Yup - this is some good stuff we're putting out here.' But it's not. This satisfaction with mediocrity is, sadly, par for the course in the Toronto food scene. A really good burger joint would be awesome on Roncy. I wanted it to be Rude Boy, I really did. Sorry to say, but it's not."}
{"text":"the burgers are out of this world.  and dont get me started on those onion rings.  the onion rings are like onion donuts, and are way tastier than that sounds."}
{"text":"Great burgers, cooked nicely with some interesting flavours. They come with a side of in-house chips, but you only get 3 of them, and two of mine were soggy...
The parm fries are solidly good, if I return I will order those again."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just a takeout/diner, but was happily surprised that it is licenced and has table service. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, which was to die for, and the honey dipping sauce was a great touch. My partner ordered one of their famous burgers and was also impressed. We split an order of fries (not included with sandwiches, and the perfect size to share). 

The only strange thing about the place was that there will several people there with their small children - I guess the place has a kid's menu. That's great if you have kids, but maybe not so great if you want a quieter place or mature atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here, order the parm fries unless you hate yourself."}
{"text":"Tired of waiting for a table at The Ace, my friends and I stumbled into The Rude Boy. The combination of decent reviews and available seating drew us in. 

The Rude Boy isn't much to look at inside or out. The restaurant resembles your neighborhood diner with dated booth and bar seating. However, The Rude Boy gets away with this by channeling a hip atmosphere through youthful staff and trendy music.

A pleasant surprise about this burger joint is its full bar. They have 4 beers on tap and a seemingly wide selection of liquor. The Rude Boy also offers signature mixed drinks for $10 a piece. I did not splurge on drinks this visit. 

Maybe it's just me, but I felt a disconnect between the food and drink menu. I found it a little off-putting that a restaurant with a diner atmosphere, serving burgers on plastic bins, offered $10 craft cocktails. I was not going to pay more for a cocktail than for my burger, at least not in this setting.

I ordered the Rude Boy burger and was a bit disappointed. First of all, the burger patty was fairly small and dry. It was almost as if someone used a spatula to flatten the patty while cooking, resulting in a loss of moisture. I also prefer my burgers to be a little less well-done. Unfortunately, it was not cooked to order and I was never asked how I wanted my burger cooked. 

Although the individual components of the Rude Boy burger sound delicious - ie. house cured peameal, fried egg, garlic aoili, house blanche de chambly mustard (what the heck?) - none of these components come together to form one cohesive product. In fact, I found the cured peameal bacon to be overwhelmingly salty and the fried egg too dry. The garlic aoili totally missed my palate.

The parm fries were good and well-portioned. Not too greasy with the perfect amount of crisp, I could not stop reaching for the basket. It's a big enough portion to share between two people. The onion rings were also tasty, but almost too crunchy. There are only 5-6 pieces, so it's not the best for sharing. 

Overall, The Rude Boy isn't quite up to par with the Burger Priest or P&L Burger. Their burger was good, but not great. I also thought that it was a tad bit pricey. As mentioned before,  the expensive craft cocktails also threw me off and it felt like The Rude Boy was suffering an indentity crisis: burger joint vs. cocktail lounge. Despite of this, it's still a wonderful burger option in the Roncesvalles area."}
{"text":"Great service, juicy burger. Onion rings were super greasy (wouldn't order them again...onion was also really thin inside, tasted like pure batter). Had the American burger and the special. Diner like feel with a grass fed burger. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review since I've been there multiple times.  We'd go more often if we had the time & money.  My favourite is the Korean burger, and their burgers are always made fresh on the spot, which is nice.  It's a classic, simple burger joint that uses fresh meat, which makes the burgers juicy & tasty."}
{"text":"Great grass-fed burgers! And yes, they will cost more than factory meat! That is because they are raised on the pasture eating grass instead of eating government subsidized grains to make them fat. 

That being said, it was homey, delicious, and very friendly."}
{"text":"The owner was great!  Attentive and tailored his delivery to my fun \"foodie\" personality.  Greasy spoon meets heaven.  Parmesan fries were thick and fluffy like that my British grandmother would stink up her kitchen with.  I asked if I should select the cheapo special or the BLT... He suggested the burger special for my first visit.  Win!  no upsell here just a great guy and Greasy yummy suggestion. The batter from the onion rings would pair better with fish vs the onion.  However the thought of the batter and flaky white fish has me salivating.  Great food, great service, and fun environment.  Looking forward to returning.  Suggested a burger grilled cheese with garlic butter crust.  Tip:  meat is ground fresh multiple times daily.  Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here a few times when visiting family and I'm always quite pleased with the food! The burgers are awesome and delicious. Beautiful grind of meat to make super juicy patties. Fries are also excellent and their poutine isn't bad either. Only negative I could have with the food is sometimes it's overly greasy and dripping but that seems to be he usual with higher quality ground beef as it has more fat marbling. Staff is friendly and everything is cooked out in front of you so you can see the steps and prep of your meal, which is nice. The price is on the higher end, took my dad and nephew in for three burgers and a shared poutine with pops and it ran me about 55 dollar with standard tipping in. Nice neighbourhood and a great place to stop but if your in the high park Dundas west area! Similar quality to places like burgernator in Kensington."}
{"text":"Got the birdman sandwich rude boy burger with the double patty onion rings and parm fries, came with spicy ketchup and the food was fresh and great, chicken in the sandwich was fried and juicy and onion rings were big but not over breaded. Total cost came to $37 and we got it to go, actual restaurant is very small and the menu is small but i would get it again"}
{"text":"The burgers here straddle the line between greasy good and greasy bad. I had the Rude boy, it was piled high with delicious toppings like Bacon, Onions and the lilke. It was great. The only downfall was the translucent grease which pooled in the bottom of the basket... The thick cut fries were kinda meh.


I've noticed a trend that all the gourmet burger places (Burger Priest.. excetra) want to make their burgers really greasy. This is fun once in a awhile but I don't want to feel my arteries shut off every time I have one."}
{"text":"I had Hurrier bring me their fish and chips when I wasn't feeling well. I expected the chips to be soggy but they were not! They were crispy and delicious. I am fickle and will say I wish there was a kale/mixed greens salad alternative. The breading on the fish was very light and crispy. I'm waiting for the day when more places offer a baked breaded alternative. Very tasty overall!"}
{"text":"great burger. kind of \"pressed\" had amazing 5 buck special at lunch. prob gets more \"bar like\" as day moves on. nice staff. and i think the buns are great!"}
{"text":"I did the burger week burger here to give it a try.  With name like Rude Boy, admittedly, I was expecting some Jamaican influence and was disappointed that they had no relation.  The cool antique beer fridge that sits behind the bad makes up for it.  Came in around 6:30 on warm Saturday and found a spot by the bar.

The burger special was a chuck patty with cured tongue pastrami, gruyere cheese and  and sauerkraut.  I'm not sure if this is on their regular menu.  Tasted great.  I'd put it above most of the franchised burger chains.  The bun is important, and was not too bready.  You also get a half pickle and some chips.  I had a side of the onion rings, which were massive and came with ballpark mustard and washed it down with a cold PBR.  I didn't really expect much from the service, but our server was friendly and took her time explaining the burger week offerings.

I can see this place becoming a boiler room in the summer as the open kitchen area is open and beside the entrance.  I think it's getting really tough standing out as a burger joint in TO and would imagine it has a hard time competing with some of the restaurants in the surrounding area, but this place has kind of a no-nonsense \"come in for quick burger and beer\" type feel to it, which I like."}
{"text":"Everyone loves a nice plump, juicy burger, right?  Well guess what, Roncesvalles has a surprise for you.  Opening up in March of this year, The Rude Boy doesn't disappoint.  Serving a variety of different burgers, and sandwiches, The Rude Boy is a perfect fit for the Roncy area.

In this day and age, organic is the norm and people are starting to expect this from restaurants.  The Rude Boy satisfies these needs/wants by  serving all natural, hormone free, organic beef, fries are hand cut, sauces and smoked items are made in-house.  For the gluten haters out there, don't fret, they provide a gluten free bun.

The Rude Boy has a really cool/hip environment with tattooed chefs and waitstaff.  The waitress was really nice, enthusiastic and she gave me her honest opinion about what is popular on the menu.  She told me the Rude Boy burger was the fan favourite so I decided to order that, with a side of parmesan fries.  I really had no idea what I was getting myself into.

This burger is no joke, it comes with a freshly ground beef patty, peameal bacon, double smoked bacon, smoked cheddar cheese, pickled red onion and a fried egg.  It also comes with homemade chips, and a lone pickle (I could've went without the pickle).  The first thing that came to my mind when I saw it, was, how the hell am I going to get my mouth around that.  With the bun being nice and soft, I squished the burger down and started.  Now I like my burgers a little messy, with the juices running down my fingers and the sauces getting all over the place.  This burger did all that plus more, I went through the stack of napkins the waitress gave me.  I was in burger heaven just like Harold and Kumar when they finally made it to White Castle.

A little suggestion for my single friends out there.  I wouldn't bring a first date here, you might turn the girl off with having sauces all over your face.  But if you make it to the 3rd or 4th date then by all means take her here.

I really enjoyed the burger but honestly I think it was a little too much, I think it could've been just as good without some of the toppings, like the smoked bacon.  But hey, I'm not the chef and I appreciate the creativity.  Like I said, it was a damn good burger and I would order it again in a heartbeat.    The home made chips are a good side and they are delicious. They were really crispy and just the right amount of salt.  There were only 3-4 chips so I think there could've been a few more.

I also ordered the parmesan fries and these guys were amazing.  I started eating them and I couldn't stop.  The fries were cooked perfectly and there was just the right amount of parmesan cheese.   With the jalapeño ketchup, I couldn't get enough of them.  The fries are a good size to share, I found the portion a little big for one person especially if you order one of the bigger burgers.

{"text":"Considering I'm not much of a burger person, this was pretty good!

We had:
The Rude Boy - My friend ordered this one. He said it was good and not too greasy, as opposed to the reviews we had read about this place. 
Seoul Man - At first I was skeptical about ordering this but it took me by surprise! It was really good, juicy with a kick of spice. 
Onion Ring - Ok these I wouldn't advertise. The batter was so thick and salty. My friend called it a donut because they were so huge with a thick ring of onion lost in it. 

Overall, the portions were big and service was good. Not too busy and the music wasn't too loud. If I was ever craving burgers when in the area, I'd go again."}
{"text":"The sting burger was great, but the onion rings lacked in taste and the batter was bad. Price point too was high for a few tasteless  onion rings. Next time if I come I'll be only getting the burger."}
{"text":"Not so cool, unless you are a hipster who likes hipster shit. Second time there and im not sure which was worse? The first time im w/ a CELIAC friend who cannot eat gluten. We got burgers to go. Got home and guess what?? ITS WASNT GLUTEN FREE. We called and were promised that we were put on the computer for a free burger. A few days later my friend tried to take them up on that! He was told there is NO computer but the girl trusted him. SO

Friday night went again to try to redeem them. Got 2 burgers to go. MADE SURE one was gluten free.

Got home, ate them, within half an hour my friend was in the bathroom for an hour then I HAD TO join him! Needless to say, it was NOT gluten free, the burgers were VERY red inside. 

We will not be back."}
{"text":"Im on fence about this one while the burger itself (The Rude boy) was good, there was nothing to great about my visit. It was empty when i came in, and it took 15-20 minutes for a burger,  now this doesnt seem bad but if they were busy sure but not if i was the first of a small crowd,

I am an onion ring guy and i had to try their and that i regreted, It was over battered and over cooked, there was no taste to it and it was a bit tough for that..

The patty was juicy, the egg was cooked well, the peameal bacon was good, it a shame i have to give this a 3 but when eating out it more then just one aspect and the slow service and the onion ring were a turn off

The waitress was nice and friendly and she's probably not at fault for slow cook time. I probably wont be back

I might go with an extra .5 for waitress bumping my rating to 3.5"}
{"text":"Just too expensive compared to similar local offerings to justify eating here. Burgers are better than average but not amazing."}
{"text":"Had quite possibly the best burger I've ever had in my life today.  And those onion rings?  Oh man I'm coming back asap"}
{"text":"Oh Roncy, I had such high hopes for you and your restaurant scene. But you keep disappointing me Like a lot of place moving into the hood too much emphasis on the hipsterisms and not enough on the fod. burger is ok at best. I probably only went back a few times cause so close to my place. but really for the amount of time you wait and how bad the fries are. Parmesean fries were like eating shredded cardboard. Its just not worth it no matter how much PBR they stack up the side  and how dive they make it. the basic burger is just not that good and the service is slow (not cause of the wait staff, you can see the cooks doing their thing and the slowdowns definitely in the kitchen). i seriously don't know how this place is on a best of list anywhere. (thanks a lot BlogTO *shaking fist emoji* ). The second star is strictly for their staff who are super friendly and make you feel very welcome. Actually the second star and 3/4 of the first star are for the staff."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and beat salad. The Americana and Seoul Man are my favorites. The staff are also very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Made it in for a quick dinner tonight (Wednesday around 6pm). It was right after it opened and it was pretty cold in there. Didn't help that we ordered cold beers that came in fantastically frosty glasses.  Can see that being amazing in the summer!

We ordered two \"Stingers\", one Parmesan fries and one onion rings. The burgers came in good time and were on big brioche buns. A little too much bun for our liking but it fit the burger well.  They cook the burgers to medium unless asked otherwise, which was perfect for us. I was expecting the burger it to have a little more bite, but it was juicy with a nice flavour. It wasn't as spicy as I would expect something with the name 'stinger'. 

The fries were really good, with a fresh grate of parmesan on top. Onion rings were HUGE and very greasy, we only ate one each. 

Lighting is very dim in the back, it was really hard to see the debit machine and I wish the server luck when it gets dark outside. Service was good and the music was very chill. The place was packed by the time we left, just after 7pm. 

I would go back but I think we'll wait to see what other burgers make it to the menu. The double burger seemed too big but I would like to try the veggie burger. Nice simple menu and looking forward to seeing it evolve."}
{"text":"Gave them a retry, burger allright but fries as hard as rocks, overcooked and stone-cold."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Love the Rude Boy. Tasty sides, homemade everything, awesome late at night or for a heavy lunch. Always have good food. 4 stars for great value to $ spent."}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing.  $5 burgers on Mondays - how can you go wrong?!?!  Order take out or you will be waiting forever for a table.  I've never dined in, always have done take out.  Seriously one of the best burgers and every Monday they feature a different burger.

Everything is made fresh that day which is a pleasant surprise.  And everything I have ordered is amazing - fries, onion rings.  Just so good.  It's definitely worth checking out and if you're not in a hurry, dine in.  It's a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Ok...yes I'm giving this a really bad review. Why you ask? Because it sucks! Let's start from the top. Came in, the guy told us to take a seat and my ass was frozen. This place has no heat except for a tiny space heater which you can probably buy at dollarama and it won't even heat up a closet. Freezing in there.
Next, I ordered the natural, because it had toppings I would enjoy (they don't have a topping list, so I wasn't sure which toppings they had) when he brought the burger it looked decent.....until I took a bite. The bread is STALE and tastes awful, the burger was still bleeding, which really made me want to puke. When you go to good burger joints like holy chuck or priest burger they ask you how you like your burger. Not this place. They had some sad looking burn chips that they added to the plate as well. I should have stayed home or even got mcdonalds instead!"}
{"text":"Second time Ive been at Rude Boy and all i can say is they are perfect burgers the Real deal! juicy and tasty, The bun was perfect too love those onion rings. The service was good and friendly the price was right. I recommend rude boys!."}
{"text":"Burgers are great. Great burgers are perfect.

 I've lived in the Junction Triangle - Roncesvalles area for a good while now, and even though I'm not right ON Roncy, I do travel down for food (and work) quite a bit. Between the Westerly, Barq, The Butler's Pantry, and The Ace (my own place of work), there is no shortage of good food. The addition of The Rude Boy only enriches the area. 

 The restaurant itself is cozy, but cool. The beautiful booths, long counter, and open kitchen are all very lovely, but the giant, old-school beer fridge is the center-piece of the whole place. Truly a great find by the owners. 

 The burgers are absolutely top. House made patties, hearty and tasty, that come on a perfectly sized bun and with wonderfully comfortable, yet hip, accompaniments (House made chips? Yes please. Pickled red onion? Damn straight). The sides, including parm fries and ENORMOUS onion rings only add to the happy heartiness of the menu. Everything is fairly priced, and the portions are perfectly reasonable. 

 The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable without being that annoying kind of attentive that can put you off a meal. I like to go out on my own and sit at the bar, and while I enjoy conversation, I do like five or ten minutes of 'me-time' just to enjoy my meal and the environment. I have no trouble with that at The Rude Boy.  

FINAL THOUGHTS: It's good. Really good. And if you're in the area, it is worth checking out. Roncesvalles, and those who live around it, are mighty lucky."}
{"text":"Juicy and thick patties made with freshly ground local, grass-fed beef at this price? I am in! 
We were driving in this area when I was craving for a burger. I yelped to find this place. It was Sunday night, several tables filled up shortly after we came. We got natural burgers (the basic one), beet salad, and onion rings. Nothing special about the burger but def had all the components right. Beet salad was okay, nice acidity to it to balance out the greasiness from the rest of the meal. With that being said, we weren't too crazy about onion rings. They were way overcooked and crunchy. They served then with yellow mustard which I never had with my onion rings before. 

Overall, not a bad place to grab a quick bite and chill. I have had better though but at a higher price. If you are looking for just a solid burger, nothing crazy, this place will do."}
{"text":"Had excellent burgers, juicy patties, fresh ingredients. Got the $10 'Week Day' Combo (which curiously is also available on weekends).  We also enjoyed huge fries, onion rings and homemade condiments. And cream soda. Will visit again."}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious! They use grass fed beef and you can taste the difference. Their buns really make the burger too. I recommend the Rude Boy, the signature burger. Such a unique and delicious combination of flavors.

Also, on Monday night they have a $5 burger special which is unheard of in Toronto!

If you're a drinker there's a full bar and beer on tap and bottles."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight for my first time at Rude Boy. I had the 8oz \"Rude Boy\" burger and shared some Parma Fries and onion rings with a friend. The burger was absolutely fantastic! Being an Australian, it was nice to see a burger that had a fried egg on it! I don't know why it isn't more popular here in Canada! The parma fries were very tasty, the onion rings were huge! They were quite greasy, but it didn't stop me from eating them all. The dipping sauce really complimented then! 

The beer selection is really good, a few nice boutique beers on draught plus the essentials in cans in the very cool looking fridge. The service was absolutely top notch with staff being very friendly and helpful. Luckily we didn't have to wait to be seated at the very cool copper finished bar where we could sit and see the burgers being made. 

I'll certainly be a regular here. I want to try all the burgers on the menu! 

Welcome to Roncy, Rude Boy!"}
{"text":"Ever had a PBR out of a frosted glass? No? I doubt many in this world have, but I was initiated to the exclusive club when I sat my toosh down on a particularly cozy stool at Rude Boy, upper Roncy's nearly-new bar-avec-burgers. 

Went on a Wednesday night. Most of the tables were full so we sat at the bar and were made to feel right at home. Owner Faze kept the drinks coming and chatted with us about how Rude Boy came to be. His and his partners' mission, a smart one, was to turn the space into something the neighbourhood was missing. I'd say it's a MISSION ACCOMPLISHED--and I'm not talking about Rude Boy fulfilling a burger restaurant gap in Roncy, although it may. I'm talking about the vintage fridge behind the bar, the wicked chandelier, the playlist that sounds like your old faves/most played count on your itunes (I recall some Belle & Sebastian and Camera Obscura, off the top of my head). I'm talking about the PERFECT PLACE FOR A DRINK. On a city block brimming with good ol' pubs that feature nightly live music acts, this place is a breath of fresh air. There's a new kid on the block, and I'm crushin--he's, like, so cool! 

As far as food goes, the Colossal Onion rings--you get about 10 of em and they are truly colossal--were some of the best I've had in my life. In addition to the ballpark mustard they come with, we asked for Rude Boy's Sirracha Mayo; definitely a good call, that stuff is way tasty. 

Can't wait to try the burger--we may have a 5th star on the horizon."}
{"text":"I really want to give Rudy Boy a better rating. Their food is delicious and I am obsessed with the heat in almost every dish and especially the jalapeno ketchup! However, the service leaves way too much to be desired. I live quite close and order take out from here on the regular. No more. The last two times I've gotten take out, they forgot one of my items (though when I called to tell them they apologized and gave me an extra item for free). The last time, not only did they forget an item, they shortchanged me $10, which I did not realize until a couple of days later. As well, the last time I went there for a sit-down meal, it took about 25 minutes before someone would acknowledge us. There were only two other full tables in the place. We waited for about 15 minutes and then I went to the counter to ask for some attention. The server there was facing the other way, entering something into the computer or till or something, and then just kept facing that way for 10 minutes. I got the sense that she was personally ignoring me but I can't fathom why, as I don't know her beyond coming into the place. Finally, the other server came and served us, but the experience was already ruined. I'll get my burgers somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Nice little burger joint on Roncesvalles, thought I'd give a try.  Very small place with limited seating, but as soon as you walk in you're hit the aroma and view of burgers on the grill.  Interesting choices for toppings, I had \"The Stinger\" with jalapeños up front, and a black cherry soda to drink, which was the perfect choice to accompany the burger.   Juicy, tasty, a good sized patty, done just right,  really enjoyed it, will def come back.  As a bonus, they play cool music too."}
{"text":"Walked in and thought I was going to slip. Something was up with the floors. Not sure if they had just been washed, but nearly wiped out on them twice.

Server didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Barely smiled. The menus were pieces of paper, which doesn't make a great first impression with me. Granted this place has only been open a couple of months, but having a menu on a sheet of paper is a little too half-assed for my liking.

Went for the natural burger, which is pretty bare. It tasted good, but was a little too bready with little toppings. And it doesn't come with a side -- had to order a salad on top. $8.50 is a bit pricey for just a burger. It was good, but certainly have had better. I suppose I would have been more satisfied with a more loaded option.

Decor is bland. Lots of Goodwill paintings on the wall, and hung crooked on purpose. Again, they've only been open for a couple of months so it might take time to spruce things up, but they should get on it by now. 

There's really nothing unique about this place in a sea of existing burger joints downtown. Would be willing to give another shot, but doubt I will make the effort to return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late lunch with my son.  It was our first time visiting as he just moved into the hood.  He was walking by this restaurant on the weekend and a couple of people walking by pointed out this was one of their favorite places for burgers in this area so
he really wanted to try it out.  Glad we did.
The room certainly has a good vibe as you walk in with great tunes and interesting poster type art on the walls.  
There are several cozy booths as well as some 2 person tables.  Also quite a few stools at the bar which looked comfortable.
The service was very friendly and quick.
I ordered the Sting burger and it was delicious with spicy monterey jack cheese, jalapeno chips, sriracha and cucumber, cilantro slaw!
My son ordered the the Rude Boy and the peameal bacon was thick and very tasty.
We also ordered the parm fries as well as the onion rings to share.  The fries were a little soggy for my licking but nice with the fresh parm shaved on top.  By far the onion rings were the best side which came with tasty ballpark mustard and made with blanch de chambly batter,  Very thick and delicious!
Looking forward to our next visit to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"The Rude Boy is a great place for a burger. On a recent visit I had a burger with maple smoked bacon, fried egg, and jalapeños. The burger was as good as any burger at Burger's Priest or similar highly regarded burger place. 

The onion rings are thickly battered, which I do not prefer, but they are still very good.

The biggest negatives here (and they are minor) are the layout of the restaurant and the service. They have low lighting and a bit of an odd layout that detracts a bit from the experience. The service is friendly, but with a limited number of servers (only one on my recent visit), service was slow or missing in spots.

If you like burgers and are looking for a contender for your favourite burgers list, you should check this place out."}
{"text":"My goodness, heaven is found. Super cool staff, amazing atmosphere and the food speaks for itself, me and my girlfriend both had the americana, one being gluten free. Absolutely perfect Burgers. Why not a 5 star you ask? Only that the fries are not gluten free as they are cooked in the same frier as the onion rings, solution, reserve only one frier for the onion rings!!! Other than this you must try this place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Wait staff are cool and nice, their music choices are fantastic and every burger I've had here has been amazing.  I usually get the special but everything is great here.  The chicken sandwich is also a great alternative.  Love the fries, especially the Kim Chi fries.  Best hipster burger joint I've ever been to.  Consistently good, which is not something I can say for most places on Roncesvalles.  Also open late, which is handy."}
{"text":"The Rude Boy is a must if you're ever in the Roncy area. This is my third visit, but definitely will not be my last. 

Today we split the beet salad, kimchi fries & rude boy burger. The beet salad came with goat cheese. This portion was perfect & the salad overall was delicious. The kimchi fries came with chunks of pork belly. This was a little much (as a side), but also delicious. Lastly, the rude boy burger. Perfection. The portion was perfect for sharing. Some of the other toppings were pea meal, a fried egg & garlic aioli. Such a good combination.

There's limit seating but it's never been too busy to get a seat. Service is always great as well. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Rude Boy four times now, and every time the burger has been juicy and delicious. It's definitely the best burger on Roncesvalles.

Most recently I was here for burger week, and the 5 dollar special was totally worth it. The only knock I'd have is maybe a bit more slaw. Other than that, I loved every bit of it. Their buns are very soft. The meat they use is fresh. And they make all the toppings in house. I ended up here after an unpleasant experience at Cardinal Rule with some super charred burgers, and my experience at The Rude Boy helped forget that ever happened.

The service I have experienced there has been very good and friendly. Tonight they were also extremely well staffed. They had a few guys cooking, and maybe four to five people serving. They were very timely filling water, and they even gave me a second napkin when I finished off my girlfriends burger (as they had already taken my basket and napkin away).

I'm definitely a fan, and as long as I'm still living in the area they will be my go to place for burgers."}
{"text":"I've tried Rude Boy twice now. The first time was not bad, burger quality was OK but nothing amazing. Had it for the second time more or less because I had little choice, needed something I could eat on a car ride that wasn't from McD's.  I wish I went to McD's and spent less and got a hamburger I would have found delicious and came with a side and drink. 

The Rude Boy sucks. There's no other way to put it. The meat was tasteless and dry. The bun was stale and way too bready. I got The Natural because I just like my burgers to have that juicy meaty taste and not some crummy patty masked by a bunch of sauce and toppings.  I think there game plan is to have mediocre chuck masked by toppings so you think you just ate something awesome when you could have just eaten a spoonful of maple bacon jam instead. 

.....and the price. Over $30 for 2 burgers and a handful of fries....!!!....if this was at least in my top 5 of best burgers I've ever had then I could live it but this isn't even in the top 20."}
{"text":"My sister in law had just given birth and I called for a burger and the grill was closed, but they made a burger special just for her !!!! Best burgers on Roncesvales ! A little pricy but definitely worth it  staff is great. Just had their special grass fed beef chuck burger with cheese bacon, sautéed onions, tomatoes and thousand island dressing... DAMN GOOD"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking to grab a bite on a Friday night and stumbled upon this place. Place is small but didn't have to wait for a table. Ordered the fish and chips bit substituted the fries for onion rings. Food came quickly and portions were good. How was the food??? Fantastic! Haven't had such good battered fish in a long time. The fish just melted in my mouth. My friends loved the spicy ketchup. I'd highly recommend this place and would definitely go back. My only complaint is that they could have turned the heat up a little. Saw a space heater plugged in so maybe they were having some heating troubles. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The kitchen up front and green diner tables are vintage rude, this burger joint cooks up meat patties such as The Contender, a smoked tounge pastrami, fried balumi, Baconaise, Lettuce and Mustard. Or try the Veg, herb marinated protobello cap."}
{"text":"So, we gave the place another try before we left Toronto - as take out this time. Burgers only, because the burgers were tasty last time around. The burgers were tasty again, but didn't sit well.

Possibly food poisoning, so consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Really glad to have found this place. The server,Jon I believe. A tall handsome rugged gentleman was brilliant. Really informative about the local area and a Stella dude. He made my girlfriends and my night! Hope to see this place again! 
Oh and the food was incredible! Really friend chef who was willing to accommodate out every whim.. (Taking the mayo of a burger).. Think his name was  christen or something. Again great guy. Will return!"}
