{"text":"TERRIBLE NEWS! After being open only a few months, Istanbul Doner is permanently closed.  Apparently, the family who owned it recently sold it and moved to Toronto. Don't know why or what their future plans are; just relaying what I was told by the new owners, who are turning the premises into a Tibetan restaurant.  I'll be happy to give the new Tibetan place a chance once it opens, but where will I go now for Iskender Kebap? Truly a loss for International Avenue and for Calgary."}
{"text":"The best little turkish family run bistro. Awesome for on the go or eat in.
Good quality with fair pricing."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS
Finally a Turkish Restaurant that reminds me of Turkey. The quality is great and their Doner + Iskander Kebab plate is to die for. Try their Pide too, it is amazing. I am going to be coming here every week."}
