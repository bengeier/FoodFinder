{"text":"This place is so awesome and authentic.  The food is great and the staff are all so friendly.  Great experience.  For parents with kids, they also have a family change room, which was helpful."}
{"text":"The old Afghan Village has been completely transformed into a beautiful oasis with 3 distinct cozy sitting areas under new ownership. 

The new Kabul - Tehran Restaurant  has been tastefully renovated and makes you feel as you have just stepped into a Sultans palace in a small village along the old Silk Route.  The interior design leaves an wonderful impression. 

The order process is very personal, you see and choose what you want based on the prepared displays and side menu.  The kind woman who served us made a recommendation to get stewed lamb that evening, which I did.  The lamb was exquisite in its flavourful stew along with  my choice of Afghan rice and a self selected ingredients salad. There is a side fridge with traditional Middle Eastern juices and pops. It looks like there is traditinal tea, however we did not inquire.

My dad ordered a chicken kebab and beef kefte which they made fresh and grilled in front of us, it  came with steamed basmatti rice  and salad.  Delicious and healthy. Overall great value and very personal service, more fine tuned than Bamiyan Kebab.  I would compare this place to a smaller version of the Sultans Tent Restaurant in terms of decor; but it is not an overpriced trap for tourists as there were 3 families there and they looked like locals. The menu captures the best dishes of Iran, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Pakistan.

Just around the corner is an Afghan pastry shop and bakery where we went for dessert.

This place is a gem.  We plan to be back again this weekend to celebrate a birthday. Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The food selection is good and persian food is realy good. The interior is different very cafe/lounge style"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is mediocre they have been open for two weeks and the server has no clue what so ever about the menu I had to ask him is he was going to serve me the side dish that was included in the dish I ordered. I was never asked for any drink what so ever and was not even served water. I ordered the rice with lamb shank which also includes one salad and a side. The price seemed ok. I could give this restaurant two stars or even one star but it has potential to grow and be better.
I went here the second time after my work
They sometimes play some nice music and the dine in area make you feel like you are in Iran or some where like that 
This has no shishaa which would've been awesome to relax after a meal."}
{"text":"Best koubideh Ive had in a long time and the basmati rice; perfect! 
It was enough food for 2 meals only for $10 total and also came with a small salad and the softest naan bread yummy! Also have to say the staff is very friendly and nice
Def will be a regular customer :)
Thank you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not closed. It is still running but it's now titled \"Kabul Restaurant and Bakery\". It went through a lot of renovations and now looks beautiful. Food is amazing here especially if you're a meat lover. Best Afghan bread in the GTA. Everyone needs to give this restaurant a try. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Afghan Village tonight but after about 10 minutes of walking aimlessly through this plaza, my friend and I realized that it had closed and now this fun looking restaurant was in its place.

The interior d√©cor is a feast for the eyes, it is covered with murals and discreet paintings. From the ceiling in the centre displaying the night sky with a comforting blue light surrounding the perimeter to the paintings of waterfalls covering the walls. I took a few minutes admiring the art.

Orders are placed at a servery style setting at the back of the restaurant and you pay in advance for your food. However, they provide all utensils and anything else you would expect in a sit down restaurant. So it's a definite mix between a sit-down and a take-out setting.  

My friend and I were fairly new to the offerings presented and asked questions about some of the dishes. The staff were so kind, they gave each of us a small plate with samplings of a couple of the offerings to help us decide. We both quite enjoyed the mild yet exotic flavors presented to us that we ordered a larger portion of what we had just been given. Single serving portions are quite filling and I brought the leftovers of mine home to enjoy tomorrow, as did my companion.

Everything was great with our meal until I bit into a hot pepper (at least that's what we think it was). It just seared my mouth and I found myself drinking tons of water over the next couple of minutes. My companion who has a much higher tolerance of spicy, had a similar experience a few minutes later and she confirmed that it was overwhelming even for her. However, aside from that, the meal was a real treat.

Price is amazing! The total for the two of us including drinks and tax was less than $20. Staff are very helpful and pleasant. They could be a bit speedier in cleaning tables after customers leave; however, that was a minor concern and it was easy to clean the table off ourselves."}
{"text":"Came here during Persian new year and was surprised it was open. Had the their special platter (with 3 different kebabs), a shawarma, and a ghormeh sabzi (kidney bean, beef and spinach stew). The kebabs were flavourful albeit a tiny bit dry. Very generous with the rice (way more than humans need in one meal) and their amazing pita bread (the have a bakery next door). Overall, good value food that is good but not exceptional. Interior is nice and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This dish has chicken breast and beef skewer. The price is reasonable that for 11.99 you get the salad, rice and skewers. 

However, the chicken is overcooked and burnt, as you can see in the picture. Although the server is nice, there is no service at all that they even called me to grab my plate after the food is cooked."}
{"text":"Nice food, reasonable prices! Good service however we were the only one in the restaurant. 
Try their chicken kebab. 
Closes early at 10pm even on Saturdays"}
