{"text":"This place is upsurdly unorganized, lacks diversity and struggles to meet the overall goal of a upscale bar. The food is average, and the wait staff is forgetful and unorganized. I have been to sportsone a few times with my husband and friends. My husband and I both have personally observed the owner Peter Thomas treat certain restaurant patrons with major disregard and disrespect. A very arrogant and overly confident man indeed. This presents a big problem when his restaurant/bar is last resort \"night out\" choice at best. If you like to wait 30-45 minutes for a drink (only to have the waiter loose your tab), and don't mind a \"night-club\" atmosphere of wanna be hipsters, this place is for you! I know that myself, husband and friends will never spend our money in this establishment EVER again!"}
{"text":"They were short staffed, so you had one person doing the work of 3. Hostess was told us \"a server was late to her shift so we can't seat you yet\". The coffee was good.  The food was average, nothing that said \"wow I want to order that again\"."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Sports One. I usually do Sunday brunch here. The food is always amazing (especially the French Toast) and the DJ was doing his thing. The hostess is very fashionable and hospitable. She's a great asset to this establishment. She makes you feel very welcome. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. The thing that I've noticed during both visits is... it took a long time for the food and drinks to come out. Apparently the staff is short on Holidays and Sundays. If Sports Once could improve the wait times on Service and Seating this would definitely be a 5star establishment and one of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Over rated!! Very small!! Put my name on the wait list, we never received a text.. hostess claims she was sending them out.. I could have done with out visiting this spot.. commenting while waiting  to place my order let's see how long they take to come wait on us!
So we arrived prior to 10pm, due to staff error and seating. We were seated around 1140, but the menu is now limited!! First and last time coming here.. they have a dj, but no dance floor.. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone.

 I continue to edit as I sit..
So we have drinks no napkins
Need to expand or upgrade to a larger location. We were not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Ok so all I wanted was something to eat and it took about3 hours for the order the waiter was considerate of my time and advise the system was backed up .., oh well at least the drinks came out fast ... I advise you to cont before 10pm if you want to eat..,otherwise you will go hungry"}
{"text":"Slowwwwww at everything. And I ordered two apps and got one...then they had both on my check. Food was good but not worth the hour plus wait."}
{"text":"Very disappointed...here from Philly to check this place out and they had a hand written note on the door (NOT on there website) they they would be closed today..REALLY..I paid $15 for my Uber from my hotel..so I roamed the streets of Charlotte and landed at the Blue Restaurant..I try to patronage AA owned businesses, but DANG"}
{"text":"Trashy.  Would give it 0 stars if I could. I thought it was supposed to be an upscale sports bar but apparently this is just another wannabe place. Service is terrible and drinks are weak and overpriced. Food is what you would expect from a local sports bar."}
{"text":"We had the chicken and waffles, along with mimosas, it was dope! Nice staff, music and food."}
{"text":"Although my first experience with Sports One was not an ideal one, the co-owner called me and made a conscious effort to remedy the situation at a later date. I will give this establishment credit for the earnest attempt and I will provide a later update should I accept the offer to return."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party..nice atmosphere my long island iced tea was just OK for $12. The wings seems marinated in lemon and just a little under cooked for my liking. How they sell wings with hair on them is beyond me. I won't count the place out it's an ok place to go."}
{"text":"The selection and the quality of food is comparable to Applebees but with Uptown prices. The paper menu was stained and crumbled. I ordered a Sangria but it was made with fruit juices and not fresh fruit. My husband ordered a beer that was on the menu but they were out though they had only been open for an hour. The service was slow and the waitress seemed inexperienced-we were dining with two friends and she reached over them to hand us our food instead of going around the table. We ordered chicken tenders and the vegetable quesadilla. The tenders are expected to be a bit greasy but the quesadilla felt and tasted like it had been deep fried with the tenders. I'd never dine there again nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the 5 stars are for... maybe because we came for lunch on a Saturday and not brunch on Sunday so didn't have any chicken and waffles. Limited lunch menu so got a burger that didn't even fill the bun. Wife got a panini that wasn't good either. Very disappointed...."}
{"text":"I recently visited Sports One on 2/22/15 for brunch.  This was actually my 2nd visit in the month of February; I came for dinner on 2/5/15.  My initial experience at the beginning of February was great, but this visit definitely exceeded my expectations.  My boyfriend and I arrived at 11:00am, and we were immediately greeted by the waitstaff and Peter Thomas (owner).  There was not a wait, since Sports One had just opened for the day.  I ordered the special of the day which was Peaches & Cream Waffles, side of bacon, and two mimosas.  My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp & Grits with a side of breakfast potatoes.  The food was served hot and it was phenomenal!  I was expecting whipped cream on my waffles but to my surprise the cream was actually a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The meal tasted like a wonderful dessert.  My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well.  I would've posted some pictures, but we were well into our meals before even thinking about a camera....sorry :-(  Later we saw another patron with the Chicken & Waffles entree, so we ordered some chicken wings to go, which were equally delicious even after reheating them later that afternoon.  Needless to say we enjoyed the food and the music playing in the background (The O'Jays, Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers, et cetera).  To top off the visit, another owner (Carlo) stopped by the table to thank us for coming and ask about our visit.  We will definitely be back, because we continue to be impressed by the food and service.  Lastly, even though brunch is a la carte our total only came to approximately $55 which included two entrees, 2 side dishes, 2 mimosas, and the additional order of wings."}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Laid back. Great place to watch the game. Decent food, the spinach flatbread was tasty."}
{"text":"So i have been here a couple times and these to past experiences was not so good. The service here is really slow . Some friends and i have came here for dinner. The food was really good. However the waitress who took our drink order took forever to come back to take our food order. My friend who ordered a dirty martini said that when she took a sip of it she could taste more olive juice than vodika. She had the drink sent back so that she could have another one made. When the waitress brought \"her other drink back\" she tool a sip and she said it was the same drink the bartenders  just put more vodka in it cause it was sitting at the top. She ended up putting water in it to water it down hopeing that it would tast better and that did not help at all . Next i called around 7:21pm to place a togo order i took me 3 times to get thru i am not sure what was going on maybe Girls at the front was to busy on there phones to answer the work phone . But when i got there someone asked what i ordered  like my food was  ready but that was not the case i think she was going to put my order in and at this time it was around 7:41pm. So now i am wondering why i even called in  the order in in the first place. So after i placed my order that i thought i called in the owner walks in. So i am standing there minding my business and i guess i expected way to much out of him but i thought he was going to at least ask have i been waited on or will i need anything. But No he just walked right past me. So my food finally comes one of the girls at the desk brings it to me i ask was there ketchup in my box she umm humm like i was a home girl. In stead of asking if i needed anything . So i get home opened my box and just what i thought no ketchup. I work in customer service and i know what i should expect when i go out especially when i want to spend my money at a place that i think has really great food. But i really do not think i will be back since the customer service SUCKS."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town so my single visit review is in comparison to other cities and not in comparison to Charlotte nightlife.

I didn't eat at this venue so unable to provide details on food quality or service.

Despite my review rating which would be a 2.5 - I would revisit the place as I guess it was new during my visit a few months back and working out the hiccups.

Interior looks great, bright, open space and decorated nicely.  It wasn't overly crowded when I was there so can't describe temperature and legroom at peak occupancy.  Seems like a nice happy hour place.

Valet - this is a MAKE IT or BREAK IT as it is your first introduction to a venue and this was the beginning of the end for me.  I was street parked across the street but my companion mentioned they have staffed valet.  Instead of risking towing or other problems I opted for valet.  Upon exchange/keys, the staffer indicated \"we work on tips\" before I exited the car.  I responded, \"I intended to tip you anyway!\"  His response, \"I was just saying!\"  WOW!  That changes the first impression from upscale venue to possibly low-end??!?!?

Hostess were great, friendly and smiley. Complimented my companion and we sat at bar. 
Reviewed drink menu and typically if presented with pricey (higher vs. other venues) beverages you are offered high end spirits to match.  I was disappointed to discover no Disaronno, Chopin, or 10Cane.  The bartender (male) was not very knowledgeable of his inventory which resulted in every question = 4+ minute wait as he searched everything.  

After a disappointed 15 minutes, I requested change (for Mr. Valet - typically I would give $5 but felt it necessary to reduce slightly on the prior interaction).  Our bartender had to wait for a more senior person to open the drawer so another 5 minute wait.

Upon exit, valet drove around with my rental car but didn't open the door for female companion.  I'm not sure he even unlocked the passenger door after he exited driver side.  We left a minor tip and drove away laughing this guy is clueless and unacceptable as it was 8ish on a Friday (during NCAA Championship 1st round) and not overly crowded or queue for valet.

HINTS TO VALET =  You ALWAYS unlock and open door for female when they EXIT and ENTER a vehicle.  Don't worry about driver (if he is male) as she is most important to impress!  2nd. NEVER NEVER discuss financial with someone as they enter (unless you are charging for valet) as it either offends them or speaks volume about yourself or misrepresents the venue and its clientele.

I would return but probably would take a taxi (HAHA) and hope they increase spirit variety."}
{"text":"My first time going to this establishment; not the best experience. For starters you're unable to call for reservations, nor make reservations upon arrival; they have to be done online in which none were available. The hostess was fortunately a sweetheart, she did the best she could although I felt as if I had to think for her at times. We settled for patio seating because apparently the empty space indoors were reserved. It took 14mins for our order to be taken and 27mins for our food to arrive. Fortunately the food was good, yet overpriced nevertheless. Nice ambiance overall yet utilization  of space and table seating has room for improvement. Hey"}
{"text":"My husband and I had Saturday brunch with friends and really enjoyed it. It's hard to find a Saturday brunch much less one on the weekend from 11-4. And you can't beat $20 mimosas where you get the whole bottle and a choice of 3 juices to make your own at the table! Or you can order a single glass for $6. There was a hiccup where half our party got someone else's food order and it wasn't realized for 10 mins so half our party didn't have anything but the server was responsive and apologetic. The French toast was good, my husband liked the fried chicken and fried egg sandwich on a waffle as a bun. And the chicken and waffles looked good and crisp. The dj added to the laid back, weekend, ready to party vibe. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot, but the service is lousy. We had a party of three. It took forever, almost 46 minutes to get our food, including the appetizer. I ordered a drink and had to remind the waitress several times.  The wait staff is very unorganized. Many are either walking back and forth or just standing around. The waitress wrote our order down and still got it totally wrong. This bar could be so much more.

I changed rating from 1 to a 3. Management comped the meal and gave for free drinks. Management just needs to get a handle on the wait staff. Thank you."}
{"text":"I never review on yelp and I have been using it for years until this awful experience caused me to...Bad service. Bad customer service. We had a big group. Took 90mins for food to come out. Then \"manager\"
Proceeded to try and tell us that they had to kill the chicken from scratch and pull the hair out and crap but why would you tell us that after 1.5hrs instead of at the beginning? made no sense because they serve mostly chicken meals, which restaurant kills their chicken from scratch? This is also while other people who came in 30
Mins afterwards at other tables got their food way before us. Then \"manager\" tried to tell us that they had to serve other people with reservation before us and that's also why...which made no sense because we had a reservation. And she was confused when we had to show her that we did have a reservation. Her lies started to fall apart. And she had nothing else to say to us besides, \"if you are unhappy you can leave\". I have never heard that from any other restaurant in my life. Extremely unprofessional and not something you will hear from a \"manager\". She should put herself in our shoes and think before she starts talking. For people who have been patiently waiting 1.5hrs for food, what do you expect and how would she feel if she watched other people get their food before herself when she made a reservation and have NOT eaten before coming there all day. You try to support small businesses and they don't know how to act. I will not be back, there is far too many other restaurants...
Here is how you can improve:
1. If you are going to take more than an hr to deliver a simple meal...tell your customers ahead of time instead of wasting their time and making them more impatient. 
2. When you do deliver the meal, do not get an attitude and tell them they can leave (put yourself in their shoes), be empathetic, express your sincerest apology - that's basic management 
3. Offer something for the long wait, do not tell them you ll think about it and see. 
4. Do not tell customers to ever leave if they are not happy, you will always loose out more than you think you are (money, time, future customers and etc)"}
{"text":"So we had a reservation for 2 at 1pm on Sunday. We get there and are seated right away. NOT ONE waiter/waitress came to see about us. One waitress walked by, saw us looking at our menu and walked THE OTHER WAY. The hostess walked by and asked if someone came to help us. We said no. She walks to the back, then walks by our table and says NOTHING. Then another set of ladies comes in and sits down and a waitress gets to  them right away. DOES NOT EVEN LOOK OUR WAY!! So after 20 minutes of nothing....we decided to leave and support another establishment. We told the hostess we were leaving because no one ever came to our table and all she waid was \"ok\". Did not even try to correct the situation or ask if we wanted to speak with a manager.

I have no idea why the whole staff decided we weren't worthy of service, but I did not appreciate being ignored.

This was my first time experiencing Sports One and will probably be my last."}
{"text":"They play loud music almost every night. Sports one is very disrespectful of the surrounding community. But....They love to blare the whisper song by the ying yang twinz. That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. It's a fire track"}
{"text":"I went for brunch a couple of times. Each time was very nice. My waitress was very nice. And the hostess is very nice as well. My reservation was for 12, even though they give you a 15 min grace period, which I arrived but my other party didn't get there till 1. she still let us get a table. Honestly, I was supposed to loose my spot."}
{"text":"We attended today for the 90's day party as well as brunch. The music was amazing and the French toast I had literally hit the spot. I must definitely go back. It was so much fun!"}
{"text":"Venue: Sports one Bar & Lounge

Decor: Lounge-Like   

Service:   Extremely Slow, Understaffed

Environment:   Black Hollywood(ish)

Food:  Full Menu 

Prices: Wayyyyy Over Priced (I'm a hit home on this in the conclusion section)

Debbie Downers:   The Service (or lack there of), the prices for food & drinks

Conclusion:  Man, where do i Start **as I SMH**   In looking for a sports bar & Lounge, what do you generally look for (Rhetorical)?  Normally excellent food, excellent service, good music, some eye candy roaming around if you decide to holler at something.  This place is similar to Bar One in Atlanta (I wouldn't be surprised if Owned by the same people).  There is free parking in the back of the building.  The bad news with that it is crowded quickly and turning into the private lot from N. College will create traffic on the street.  Not just some 1 minute wait but more or less upwards to 10-15 mins especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  Your best option if you have patience issue like I have is to park directly across the street and pay $5.  It will save you time & there is plenty of parking there.  Ok the parking is out of the way.  The place is literally the size of a 1000 Sq foot apartment.  It is extremely tight in there. No space .... AT ALL.  Who wants to be claustrophobic in going to a sports bar & lounge? Not Me!!!!!!  The lack of space, squeezing by of people at every turn is a little too much.  The table wait is an extreme nightmare.  The wait service fails to neglect you a time of when tables are available after you have put your name on the list.  Who does that??? Now this is what's funny and no lie Yelp!  Waited 30 minutes on a $12 ciroc & pineapple drink (8 oz) that was 90% pineapple. OVERPRICED!!!!!!! You can't be serious! It's like some establishments are voluntarily wanting to get aired out on these reviews.  Listen, the only thing that is going on about this place is the wait staff.  Exceptional eye candy (that's if you can get past all the yaki & weave down the back) . same thing with some of the women customers that show up that represent the city well. Outside of that, extremely overrated, waste of time.  A who's who black hollywood place.  Don't get me wrong, that's if you into such a venue.  Some of the prior reviews were on point!  Take notice.

Overall: A Strong D-"}
{"text":"Saturday Brunch - The music is great and makes you feel like you are at a Day Party!  The service is awful!  We waited 1 hour and 50 minutes for our food.  We had to even get up and grab the bottles of champagne we ordered.  Then experienced the ignorant behavior of RHOA owner; Peter Thomas.  Best of luck to him!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Charlotte for the weekend and this place was recommended by a friend. She went to college in Charlotte, so she knows all of the hot spots. I'm from Atlanta, so of course I gave Peter Thomas' restaurant a try. I would support fellow Atlanta natives any day.

Since we had to get back to Atlanta, we came around 11:10am (they open at 11) on Sunday. Immediately I noticed how nice it looked inside. A lot of people say Charlotte is the new(old) Atlanta, and it did look like any nice restaurant/bar in the Atlanta area. We were seated promptly and the entire staff was friendly. We wanted to order mimosas, but they don't serve alcohol until noon in Sundays...bummer. I decided to go with a classic; chicken and waffles w/ a side of scrambled eggs. Living in Atlanta, I've had my share of chicken & waffles and I think I am a pretty good judge. When my food came out, I noticed there was already syrup (or some kind of sauce) on the waffle. I'm very particular about condiments, so I didn't like that. I usually end up taking home leftovers, so I don't like saturating my food with sauces or anything. Aside from that, the food was really good. The waffle was soft, but had light crunch to it. The chicken was great and had a kick. Like it was marinated or battered with hot sauce. It wasn't too spicy though....I don't do spicy. My friend got fish (tilapia) and grits. She was disappointed at first, seeing the strips of fish. She assumed it would be a fillet. She ended up really enjoying her food though. Overall I had a good experience here and would come back if I'm ever in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"First time here. Ambience nice, cool spot. Server and staff were friendly but the loaded fries were scarce, cold and loaded down with a bunch of goopy cheese! The crab spinach dip was not horrible but very unimpressive. We sent the fries back to be remade and they came back just as bad. Sadly enough our server nor the manager had enough of a service attitude to remove the fries from our bill given our obvious dissatisfaction. If I go back it will be for drinks only."}
{"text":"Peter you have a great spot. However your \"management staff\" needs work .
They need to recognize money coming in the door is better than future reservation money ...you missed out on $1000 tab this Sunday because she could get me a table that I'm sure only spend about $100....it's all about math my brother ...please stress to them the meaning of VIP....and VIP always gets a table .

Much love and success my brother . I hope I can get over been disrespected and give your place another shot !

Thanks again and nice to meet you !"}
{"text":"Its always something. Drinks were good. Smothered fries were banging. Salmon bites ok. Took 30 mins to purchase ground coffee to go because manager had to do transaction, da fuk. I guess patrons shouldn't buy ground coffee from the club on a Friday night, smh."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes before the server came to the table to take our drink order. Only to wait 30 more minutes to be told the kitchen was closed so no appetizers and no drinks... not even water. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"So I'm in town for the weekend and had a taste for a burger. So of course, I hit yelp and found this spot. What a mistake. Horrible burger, dry (no matter how I ordered it), no taste, and the menu wasn't appealing at all, but I said it hat the heck.  I Ordered cheese they forgot, I ordered medium-well it came out burnt, I ordered medium it came out done.  I will applaud the manager because he did take care of the bill! At least they did that. It earned them an extra star."}
{"text":"Will never return! Horrible Service and Management. Food was disgusting; I ordered shrimp Caesar salad and it was so salty I couldn't even enjoy it. How do you mess up a salad? When the server brought the food to the table, I had no utensils to eat with. Had to wait an additional 10 mins before I could eat. By the time I got what I needed to eat with my shrimp was Cold. I can continue to go on and on about how bad the service and food was. I didn't want to give any stars as all, but I hope this helps people to see how bad of a place this is."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch here is probably one of the best in town.  The chicken and waffles are the best. The grits will rival any grandmothers grits. On this particular visits the service was not the best and the music was very loud given it was Mother's Day. Could not hear my son and he was sitting directly across from me. The atmosphere is always pleasant and the restaurant was clean.  Overall I definitely recommend you visiting for Saturday or Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!!! Nice atmosphere with people from all walks of life. A great place to wind down after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Small but the food looked great. Nice atmosphere and the music was perfect. They should get more chairs or Bar stools though lol"}
{"text":"I met some girlfriends here for happy hour and it was actually a really cool laid back place.The crowd was grown and sexy and the vibe in the place was very relaxed. It seemed like there were a lot of \"regulars\" on the night we went so that was nice to see. 

Like other reviews have mentioned the place is a bit small, but it works for a more intimate atmosphere like a girls night out or a quick stop to grab drinks before dinner or a movie. 

 It wasn't extremely packed when we arrived so our waitress was prompt and helpful. We went on the night they offered $5 Sangria which were delicious. I tried the chicken quesadilla and it was very good. My friends had the calamari and a burger and both said that the food was good. 

Overall, it's a pretty solid spot to grab a drink or meet up with friends. I'm looking forward to seeing how it will continue to grow in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The music was old school hip hop I absolutely loved the it! I wish I could've stayed but it was impossible as the place was very small and very limited seats! Very long wait to sit so I stood and enjoyed a beer and the music and left ! I'll get there early next time"}
{"text":"A friend and I met at Sports One for a dinner meeting. It is a very nice place with great ambience. After being seated, we were approached by Alex, our server. She was the most friendly, courteous, and attentive server I have had in recent memory. She was outstanding. I felt like I just came to visit one of my favorite relatives. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Flatbread which was tasty. I also ordered the bottom-less lemonade, which Alex made sure was refilled before I had to ask. We were so impressed with Alex that we called her manager over to our table and described how great our experience had been. The manager and the Chef came to our table to ask about the overall experience and about our food. By the time we were done, I had to give Alex a \"Family Hug\" on the way out. I had a great time and will return in the near future."}
{"text":"It was mine and bae's first time going and enjoyed it very much! They have the best Stuffed Salmon we've ever tasted and the staff was very friendly. Music was nice and crowd was very chill."}
{"text":"Ok it looks better on tv, very small ,limited sitting and the parking sucks. Stood for 10 min all the waitress walking by not one ask could I get you anything . No service skills what so ever . I was in town for my birthday and I really wanted to go here"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Drinks great. Need more space on the weekend, very crowded, maybe move the chairs out/tables and just have the booth seating available only after 10pm for more movement! Love that ladies are free, you will spend your money at the bar!"}
{"text":"This review is not based off of going to this spot one time.  I like the venue and I think it's a great atmosphere.  The food is great, I haven't had a bad item on the menu.  I've had their fish tacos which I think were the best I've ever had and I travel a lot and I've had some of their burgers which are very good also with the sweet potato fries.  The drinks in sports one are kinda pricey.  A Heineken cost $6 a pop so you can imagine how much the drinks cost but it's cool your in a good environment around some cool people but the customer service needs to be improved.  I've been going here for months before I wrote this review and I think the service has gotten worse since my first visit.  There are times when I went here just to get something to drink and left because they don't have enough people on staff to handle the crowd or the waitress forgot I ordered a drink and I just got up and walked out.  Not a good look for such a nice establishment.  I find that I keep coming back because you don't find this type of crowd in too many places in Charlotte and it's sad but as long as your not in a hurry and remember what I told you about the slow customer service then you should be fine.  Just a quick example, I timed how long I had to wait for a burger and fries this past weekend while watching the football game.  It wasn't packed but I had to wait 30 minutes and they run out of food a lot.  I have experienced this a few times while going there.  I like the place that's why I keep going back but it needs improvement.  This has the potential to be one of the best sports bars in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for brunch. The location and space is cool! There's a dj for atmosphere and always a lot of people. The food is decent, however, the service is always lacking. Twenty minutes to get basic drinks is ridiculous. Having to walk to the bar to get your own glasses for the bottles ordered is even worse.  An hour for food turn over is crazy in the restaurant business.I always feel the bar is understaffed & waitresses are always overwhelmed. Getting your table cleared off is not gonna happen unless you ask because there seems to be no bus service in place. Waitresses are doing double duty. I feel bad for them, Im sure they aren't getting tipped due to poor service that is no fault of their own. Management needs to hire more people and train the existing staff. This spot is nice if you want to people watch, other than that they have a lot to work on."}
{"text":"Omg !!!! I absolutely love this place!!! Service !!! Ambience !!! And the food!!! LAWD!!!! We need this in Cali!!!"}
{"text":"Visited there for the first time on Sunday, 2/18/18 with my girlfriend. We had reservations for brunch. The place is really nice and the customer service was great. It was not that busy at all. The music was a bit loud and I would of preferred to hear some nice jazz for a Sunday brunch rather - but they did play some Ray Charles mixed in.  I had the salmon bites with cheese grits and potatoes. It was okay - the salmon bites were fried a bit hard, but okay. We also had mimosas?  I thought it would be already mixed and infused with fruit - but it was just a bottle champagne and the waitress just gave us pineapple and cranberry juice to mix ourselves. So wish they can step their mimosa game up. Overall, will visit again and likely try the wings or smothered pork chops. Was hoping to see Peter - but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is a great place to hang out any day of the week! I prefer here than any other bar in town. However, there is so much room for improvement. One thing I notice is that management is not responsive to feed back. The things people have consistently complained about are still happening. Service is always lacking. You are losing money when people are ordering food and/or drinks and they have to wait 30 to 40 minutes. I could easily have 2-3 cocktails while waiting on my food order. You literally have to hunt your waitress down! 
Food is very expensive but oh so tasty. Portions are way off though. Zucchini and Spinach are very cheap so I can't understand WHY there's 4 slices of Zucchini on my plate and a spoonful of Spinach. That is just wrong!
On the weekends the place is packed and after about 10, it's pretty much a circus. Unless you have a seat already, your standing in the middle of the walk way or at the patio door. 
The place is always clean and the owner has always been present when I am there. This spot is so refreshing. It takes me back to the days of Crawfords. I really want to see them exceed hopefully they can step it up a bit. I appreciate you for bringing some life back to Charlotte. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I came to Sports One Bar because first of all I'm a huge fan of Real Housewives of Atlanta. When I saw it on TV I knew I had to check it out to see what it was all about. I'm from out of town so I wasn't aware of the reservations in order to maintain a seat. But we were able to snag a seat at the bar. The bartender was very professional and informative in terms of the food and drinks. The fruit loop drink is  fruity and refreshing, especially if you like vodka and the hot honey wings were delicious. The people there are clean and professional. The outside looks as good as the inside. The atmosphere was clean, vibrant plain yet classy with professional photos of models and sports figures aligning the wall. The plasma TVS adorn the walls behind the bartenders so you never miss a game. The people surrounding us were friendly and I didn't feel rushed to leave like other bars would do if you just sat and sipped. I enjoyed what little time I had left there."}
{"text":"The good then the bad...
Good: great venue, parking, price, ambiance and the service ON POINT!!

bad: the drinks just didn't do it.  I have no words to describe the mojito, personally I think it was made wrong.  Peters's passion and the sangria was a better choice."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for Brunch! The food was excellent. The service was top notch I was greeted by the owner Peters Thomas. Our waitress Raven was very attentive and very nice. The atmosphere was great with a live DJ that kept the mood going."}
{"text":"Fantastic Saturday Brunch! I why it's called Charlotte's Best Brunch Experience. Great music, food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited Sports One in Charlotte yesterday for CIAA weekend. Of course it was crazy booming, and crowded but I expected this! The entrance is nicely decorated, and the hostess were pleasant. My boy and I stood near the bar to make a to-go order and grab a quick drink before hitting a day-party down the street. 

We were able to squeeze a spot in the middle of the bar, great for people-watching and checking on live games on flat screens in your visual! The prices is where I wasn't as satisfied with, I paid $14 for 5 salmon bites, and although good it was lacking on the \"fullness\" factor. For the price, I could have got a salmon dinner at another spot. I did love the flavor of the dipping sauce, and it came out pretty fast...around 10-15 mins. Bartender was chill, I liked her service.

Parking might be tricky, if it was later in the evening, but it is all free in the back of the building. I would come back and try it again during a regular weekend, maybe when it's less busy and I can fully enjoy the experience, a little pricey imo though. 

3 STARS"}
{"text":"Standard Southern brunch menu available with a bit of the twist. I got the chicken and waffles with the fried bananas. 

The service is what will get the low stars. They were late and distracted, though it was not busy. The owner was apparently there talking on a cell phone and didn't even go to all the tables to say hi. Our waitress said they only had bottled water which is weird. It took extremely long to get our check.

I didn't dislike the food, but I wasn't sure about the hype. Probably won't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"It's a good lounge and not really a sports bar. I'm giving it 3 stars for the good food but the slow service and expensive drinks brings it down to 3 stars. I've been here several times and the service is a bit slow for such a small place. But let's get to the food. The calamari is good. I've been dying to try the salmon bites, they were out every time I've been here, so I jumped at the opportunitywhen they said they had them. I was envisioning the salmon bites to be more like a crab fritter with breading mixed in with the salmon. Much to my wonderful surprise, they are literally bites of real salmon with no breading mixed in and fried crispy on the outside. They were great and well seasoned. I think the way they have them paired with honey mustard sauce is great. I also like the shrimp skewer and their wings. Their drinksnare a bit expensive. $14 for a Moscow Mule is a bit much if youre not using top shelf/premium Vodka. Most Moscow Mules will run you $7-$9. I'm not too quick to go to Sports One bc the venue is so small and it can get really crowded and really tight in there and the drinks are expensive. But I do like their food."}
{"text":"So I've noticed that the reviews are pretty mixed, but I had an awesome experience. In from out of town celebrating my birthday weekend we decided to stop in for Sunday brunch. We got there shortly after they opened and I'm glad as the place is small and as soon as the church crowd let out it started to get busy. Brunch was delicious! I had the bacon egg cheese panini with breakfast potatoes and my other half had the chicken and waffles. We also split a bowl of the creamiest grits I've never had. Bottomless mimosas (that continued to flow throughout our visit) was our choice of beverage. The staff is friendly, waiters and owners both. They met and exceeded my expectation in ensuring that we were well taken care of. Our drinks were never empty. Food was hot and served promptly. Very nice laid back environment with appropriate music and of course lots of TVs (it is a sports bar ). Free parking on Sunday located right next to the lounge.
I realize everyone will have a different experience but I have no complaints! Next time I'm in town I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome food. 

Try the salmon bites. 
Brunch was amazing!!!! Our server was very attentive and friendly. Each person in our party of 5 got something different and everyone enjoyed their dishes! 
The music/ DJ was ONNNNNNN and played music that we had no choice other than to dance to. 
Atmosphere was lovely and modern. 

I throughly enjoyed my time here. I strongly suggest it if you're in the charlotte area."}
{"text":"Service was decent and so were the drinks. The music was pumping & I loved the fact that they offered a late Sunday brunch. The food was delish!"}
{"text":"Finally getting brunch @Sport Bar One. I had smothered fried pork chops and grits. What the menu should of said Pork chop and a load of grits. As alway the food was season well and good
My  complaints the portion of pork chop it may have been the smallest pork chop I ever had and the server only brought my sister a fork no napkin or knife."}
{"text":"I'm running a tab at the bar, yes they are holding my credit card. Bar tender made a dirty martini less dirty as requested too dirty. Got her attention, she snatched the drink & threw it away & didn't bring me another drink. Now I'm 32in in standing right in front of her waiting for the drink to be remade, I get 3 bar tender attention & they all told me didn't have time.  Damn, can I have my credit card.  Being a bar tender in my 20's, if a customer is dissatisfied, you ask what would they like not ignore them.  Sports one is only popping right now because Charlotte has nothing else ratchet going on. As I'm writing this, I inhale the smell of marijuana. Smdh. Ratchet! Sports one can I have my black card please!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them a star is because I can't give a zero!!! I have came here numerous times. Smh  At first the service was okay and I was like well they are going to have growing pains. Now it has been what....over 2 year since they opened and the service has got worst! Like really...it's no reason that I should have to wait anywhere for 30 mins to an hour for food and drinks. And when we ask the waitress about our food she asked us what did we order!!! What the hell..you're our waitress how you don't know what we ordered. I really don't know how they are still open cause the service is HORRIBLE and there drinks are waaaaay over priced anyway!!! I'm so over this spot and can't support it anymore. Dont waste your time going to this here. They need to close and let real restaurant owners run this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Came out for a friends birthday and had the pleasure to meet Carlo the owner. Not only did he stop and speak graciously, he got my food from the kitchen, bought me water & sang Happy Birthday to my friend. What a great 1st experience. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I visited the Bar last night for a girls night and to watch the home team play on Monday night football. We made reservations and I arrived 15 minutes early and my sisters arrived 8 minutes after our reservation time. The service was poor, the servers and bar tenders were training other employees, our appetizers came out with the entree's, we only received 2 refills the entire night, our server was not attentive at all, our food order was wrong, specials were not being honored, and the manager (Clyde) was not solution base, he was passive and dismissed our concerns. I will not return back to this restaurant EVER again. As I read other reviews and talk to people that have been here we are all saying the same thing \"SERVICE IS SLOW & POOR\"!!  I try to support our African American business owners but these are some of the reasons I will rather go to Chilli's, Fox & Hound, or Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"So far so good! I was there 2 weeks and ago and really enjoyed myself. The atmosphere is laid back but fun and the food was great. Looking forward to making this a go to spot for catching the games during football season. It's a nice addition to Queen City night life."}
{"text":"I guess we came on a good day...although out was all star weekend it was not crowded. We were seated right away. The owner Peter from RHOA was there. They had plenty of tv's with the game and around 8 since it was Sunday, some of the tv's switched to RHOA.  The food took a very long time to come out. All I ordered was a salad and sandwich. It's $4 for a soda. The menu is very basic ...one page. The waitress was nice but very slow with everything. Overall a good place to hang out but not if your hungry."}
{"text":"This is a night club rating. I felt like there was an older crowd there.  After a few drinks it was okay, but b4 the drinks I felt out of place. I think it's kind of small. I expected more."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great atmosphere, fantastic bar service and the food is really good.  Love to attend the Saturday day party, \"I Love the Nineties\"!!"}
{"text":"I give it three stars because there's room for improvement. The ambience is nice, it's just a little too cozy ..the tables are close together and at the bar people are constantly crowding over you..the food was decent and so were the drinks. I don't really think either regular menu items are terribly over priced but their daily specials are. Not sure I'd return unless they expanded and offered more space. It definitely gets too crowded for the space."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday. They have a very small menu. The music is very loud as if your in a club. The service is a bit slow. I had the chicken and waffles and it was delicious. It's a bit pricey. The plate comes with hot sauce, syrup and an almond butter that was pretty tasty. The waitress took my plate before I finished my food. I wasn't happy with that. She also brought me my check with no pen and I couldn't sign, couldn't get her attention because the music was so loud so I ended up getting up and going to the front desk and using a pen there.. Smh there is definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is Peter Thomas's 2nd restaurant/lounge in Charlotte & his food, drinks & Peter's Brew is always so tasty!"}
{"text":"My first time going here was okay. It was last month for apps and drinks for a friends birthday. Luckily we had reservations because the wait was a long one. So if you decide to go during the weekend, make sure you make a reservation. The Friday night we went, was slow at first but as the night went on the crowd started getting thick. 

Our party was eight people and we were seated at the back table near the bathrooms. I liked the view at first but once I noticed the mirrors on the walls accross from the bathrooms, the doors flying open and the reflection of a guy holding himself at the urinal was a bit messed up while I was trying to enjoy my overpriced drink. I was a bit disgusted. One of the guys with us said it bothered him as well when he opened the bathroom door to see a guy right at the door using the urinal. I think the layout of the bathrooms were not thought out well. 

I think the drinks are a bit overpriced. I had heard that from other friends who had gone before me but I had to see for myself. I don't think the drinks were anything spectacular that can't be made using what you have at home. The food was okay. I LOVED the salmon bites but most everyone at the table got appetizers. Wings, quesadillas, chicken Cesar salad, calamari and salmon bites. Lets start with the quesadillas, normally shredded lettuce comes with it but they put mixed greens on the side instead. Strike one for me. If you serve it make sure its served correct. The calamari was tasteless and I'm sure it wasn't fresh, which is okay because they're not a seafood spot but add a little flavor to it. I didn't taste the wings but no one took them. I knew something had to be wrong if wings were left behind. I'm sorry but we love a wiiiing! I really did like the salmon bites. I little too much batter but all in all the flavor was there for me. 

Like I shared earlier, the drinks are over priced. The limes were dry and there was no ginger ale. A lot of places I have frequented lately make their ginger ale, which always results in a bad drink. I think have REAL ginger ale makes the fizz to the drink exceptional. I would like to see the mirrors come down off the walls near the restrooms, better drink assortment with reasonable pricing and work on the appetizer menu. If I go back for dinner, which I'm not leaning towards that, but if I do, I will review the dinner menu. 

All in all I had a good time. The food was okay, the drinks were okay but the DJ was really good. I have seen the transition of this building and this is best I've seen it. So kudos on that but a little more work on somethings and they could be at the top of the lounge life in the QC."}
{"text":"came to charlotte for meetings for a couple of days and came here twice. Everything I had was AMAZING:

-Crab Dip
-Fried Shrimp
-Turkey Sliders
-Sweet Potato Fries

Service was attentive and hospitable."}
{"text":"Last weekend my friends and I visited this bar. It was semi packed so we asked host could we write our names on the waiting list. She informed us it was no list but we would be seated in 30mins. Okay! After that duration passed we were expecting to be seated. So my friend gets the other host attention. She informed her now is 2 minutes until you can seat yourself time. WHAT! And she was about to be off and basically didn't care what we did. Okay so no one is moving. So we found seats on the patio. The tables were move-able but there wasn't enough room for 4 people. We all ordered wings they were good. One of my friends wings were burnt and not edible. We also had crab dip that was amazing. I would recommend that to everyone. The vibe was a little old school but funny. The music was a mix of old school hip hop and r&b. I enjoyed the food because I was starving. One thing that was unforgettable was the eclecticed vibe and music I had not heard in years."}
{"text":"On SaturdayJune 24, 2017 I was invited  by friends in the Charlotte  area to check out Sports One Bar for brunch. It was my first  experience and it will be my last. For starters, I'm from Columbia, SC. The server and service was awful along with the unprofessionalism from the manager. It took 45 minutes for us to get water, utensils were never brought to the table before  nor after the food came out. When ask to speak to management, that also took forever. While the manager did give us 25% off on our bill and a bottle of champagne, on Tuesday June 27,2017 I discovered on my checking account I was charged $93.37 and my bill (receipt) was $14.10 by Sports Bar One employee which was not the amount I signed for on my receipt. Tuesday evening I called Sports Bar One and spoke with the manager Deandre(Dee) to fix the situation on getting my money back which I'm yet to be refund. At this point I'm ready to bring in my lawyer if needed, because this is fraudulent and very unprofessional. 

Unhappy customer!"}
{"text":"Sport's one where do I start....... since this place opened I've tried to support, I've tried to give them chance after chance. I just can't do it anymore. The service is SO slow, not the typical busy place slow. Its a Sunday night of a 3 day weekend and they have TWO waitresses and ONE bartender. It's utterly ridiculous! 2 of my girlfriends and ordered wine which took 25 minutes to arrive and came in plastic cups.  we asked why they were in plastic cups and were told they were trying not to use actual glasses. I've never heard of this in my life. We ordered wings and a bottle of vodka which also took 30 min plus to bring out to us. Totally unacceptable, I'm pretty sure the service here is getting worse rather than better over the years. Oh and we were sitting on the patio attempting to watch the basketball game and the sound wasn't working on the TV and no attempt was made to rectify it."}
{"text":"Sports One's food is always amazing. The service isn't always the best, even with a small restaurant. I love the brunch vibe and the mimosas. I ordered the salmon and bites and grits. The salmon bites are my favorite!"}
{"text":"The decor and setting I really enjoyed. Their are plenty of tvs to enjoy the games being broadcasted. It had a sophisticated, grown and sexy feel. The wait staff is average, nothing I would say is over the top service, not bad service just average. A DJ was present playing a mix of reggae, r & b, and jazz (the music level was a tad loud for a Sunday brunch in my opinion tho). The only huge setback for my group of 4 was the time length between ordering and actually receiving our meal (close to 45 minutes). Our order consisted of French toast with a side of breakfast potatoes, grilled salmon with eggs, chicken & waffles, and cheese bacon panini with breakfast potatoes. Oh also two mimosas. Total came to $77 and some change. The food was great expect the sausage patty was not warm when we received them. This was my first time trying rum butter sauce and it was delicious!! I would patronage this business again and looking forward to exploring their menu."}
{"text":"We were there for the 90's Hip Hop Brunch this past Saturday. I was leery due to the reviews about the service.  There was no need to worry.  The DJ was amazing. The service was great contrary to a lot of the other reviews. We had grits and salmon and I wanted to lick the plate.  It's in a perfect location. Walking distance to everything downtown. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"On a visit to Charlotte, i had the pleasure of dining at Peter Thomas' from the RHOA, for Saturday afternoon brunch.  We arrived early, so the place wasn't very busy. But the dj was jammin old school music so i was happy. Love old school! 

We had reservations so we were seated right away. The waitress was prompt in taking our order, serving up the mimosas and offered to take our picture. She saw us struggling taking selfies, lol. 

The food came, my daughter-in-law and i ordered chicken and waffles.  My son had steak and eggs with potatoes and toast. The chicken was crispy and well seasoned. It was wings, the whole wing not those little wing pieces that looks like they came off a pigeon. The waffles were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle with the butter melting just the way I like it. My son enjoyed his steak and eggs as well. 

While dining and enjoying the music, i looked up and realized the place had began to fill. Some folks were casual, some dressy, some younger, some seasoned and diverse in culture. The vibe was awesome!!!

The only issue was waiting for the check. I asked for a box for my food, this would have been a good time to bring the check. We waited for at least 15 minutes for our waitress to bring the check. I flagged her and asked for the check and still waited while she brought water to the table next to us, took orders on the patio and whatever else she was doing. Nothing against the restaurant, this was on the waitress. 

I would definitely go back next time I'm in Charlotte.  Other than the check situation, I loved the food, atmosphere, music and mimosas!!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I visited this very nice lounge to have brunch and watch the football game on Sunday, 1/17/16 between the Panthers and the Hawks, and from warm welcome we received upon entering the establishment to the hostesses and waiters, on down to the food was an amazing experience. 

We arrived shortly after 1pm and although we had to wait approximately 2 hours to be seated, we were still able to watch the 1st half of the game from the waiting area; for they're flat screen TV's lined up on one wall which makes it convenient for everyone to have a great view. While we were waiting to be seated, the hostess, Tiffany (I believe that was her name), checked on us regularly to ensure that we were okay and we assured here that we were just fine. Finally after being seated as soon as the 2nd half of the game commenced, we ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffle entree, Lemonade, and drinks and it was scrumptious. 

Although it was an array of people there at the time we arrived, we found a parking spot immediately upon entering the parking lot. Parking is 'free' and there's no charge to enter the lounge. The drinks and food are very reasonably priced, and although I don't drink, my best friend claimed that the drinks are worth every penny and we both can vouch for how delicious the food was. 

Peter Thomas, owner of this establishment, was there the entire day watching the game and interacting with guests as though he was a customer himself. He was so laid back and didn't mind taking pictures with people. As I mentioned, my friend arrived there at 1pm and didn't leave until 7:30pm and Peter was there before we arrived and after we left so I highly commend him for spending the entire day with customers opposed to just stopping by for an hour or so and leaving. We did manage to get a photo with him as we were walking to my car that evening so I'll post that shortly after this review. 

This was my second visit to Sports One Bar & Lounge and both times I had a fantastic time. I drove 2 hours from Raleigh to watch the game here and it was definitely worth the total 4 hour drive (coming and going), and I'll definitely return whenever I'm back in Charlotte. 

As I conclude my review, my advice to making a reservation is... If you plan on going to this lounge to watch a game, keep in mind that it's a 2 hour maximum limit that you are able to sit a table. In other words, after sitting at a table for two hours, a hostess will inform you that you have to leave the table, but you can always go sit at the bar, dance to the nice music on the dance floor, or stand around and mingle. Seating is limited and they have to accommodate their guests who make reservations so I completely understand. Overall, 5+ stars to Sports One Bar & Lounge!"}
{"text":"Service was slow non-existent.  The salmon appetizer was greasy. The rest of the food was mediocre...nothing outstanding.  There were several people in there who were clearly drunk, and probably should have been cut off from ordering any more liquor. They were loud and no one from the staff asked them to be quiet or leave."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to me by my mom who heard good things about the restaurant. Well we visited during our time evacuating from Florida due to Hurricane Irma and lets just say, I came, I saw, and I won't return. Our waitress was very pleasant, she was new so we chalked up some of her mistakes to her learning process. But on first encounter, we made reservation for their Sunday brunch and I called and told the hostess we needed to move back our time because we were running late. She said it was no problem and she had us down. However when we entered and told her our name she immediately said oh you guys almost missed it(meaning we almost missed our reservation, but wait didn't I call and you said we were okay) never mind moving on. So this was a bad first encounter to a new place I have never been especially when we are not from here. 

The food, it was good but nothing to be extremely excited about. I had the chicken egg and waffle sandwich, good but one thing I wish they would put on their menu and or tell customers when sandwiches have cheese on them. I was able to take off the cheese I guess because it has not melted all the way thankfully. The chicken was extremely hot temperature wish which was nice, however the potatoes were not and neither were the eggs or waffle. So kind of a let down, but still decent. We did order the mimosas which turned the meal around from being boring to be okay. Other got their chicken and waffles, the shrimp and grits, and the French toast. The shrimp and grits were slightly creamy but need more gravy and when asked for more, we were told it would be an up charge. If you state on your menu creamy grits shouldn't they be creamy...that's just my opinion. The chicken and waffles were good, the chicken again was hot the waffles were not, the sauce on the waffles was very tasty but was unable to get an extra to sprinkle across the waffles. The French toast were good but the side of bacon was subpar, it looked like plastic and apparently tasted very similar. 

Overall good place, nice decor, but there are a few things that need to change for this place to really be good. I won't be going back unless they change some things."}
{"text":"My husband & I visited Peter's Charlotte Sports One restaurant & I must say it was nothing like we thought it would be. The atmosphere was nice, the restaurant was clean but the seating was horrible. The seats are too close together. The waitress could not take the couple sitting directly beside us order without her behind directly in my face. The food was expensive, I ordered some lauded French fries, and we waited for 35 minutes to receive some cold fries that costed $11.00. The drink I ordered came out with something floating in my glass. Our waitress forgot about us, I say that because it took her another 20 minutes to bring me another ordered if fries. My husband ordered the salmon & green beans and asked if he could have the salmon blackened? They said sure! Presentation is everything. His salmon was well seasoned he said but it wasn't cooked like he asked & the charged him $2.00 for blackened season for his salmon. This restaurant isn't what it was portrayed to be on the RHWOA reality show. That was the only reason why we visited his restaurant in the first place. We will not return nor recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"My first time there & Everything was great, the food was good, my family was in there & we even seen Peter & took a picture with him!!!"}
{"text":"The night started out great we were able to get into the free parking lot before it was full! Once inside we quickly realized we should have had reservations! My husband looked up the place so I won't say that I didn't know we need reservations! But u need reservations for a table! Since we didn't have table reservations we sat on the patio! They had fans so we were comfortable! We ordered Asian wings and loaded fries (no onion) and what received was baked wings with no flavor and loaded fries with onions! So after we picked around that food we settled back and waited on the dj to turn up the party! After two hours of slow/med rnb I was ready to turn up but I started my yawning and my husband knew it was time to leave... wished the dj would have turned the party up a little earlier! The place was busy so it was time! DJ"}
{"text":"What an AMAZING way to start my Birthday month and Easter Sunday. My sister, best friends and I. Decided to Brunch at \"Sports One Bar & Lounge. And it was amazingggggggggg! I've eating dinner there a few times, and decided this time I'll try brunch. While the ladies and I waited, we sipped on endless Rosè mimosas. The staff was warm and kind. And gave the great \"Southern Hospitality\" that I was looking for.  I didn't get to see Peter the Owner. But the food made up for it. I enjoyed the Delishhhh Porkchop and Grits. I mean it was sooooooooooo gooooooood. I hardly spoke to the girls while eating. The smothered porkchop was cooked to perfection, and was grits we great as well. Season and creamy goodness. The flavors went well together. My sister and friends all had the chicken and waffles. They 100% approved their meal as well. I would give this place an A++++ 
They also serve Caribbean food for dinner on Sunday nights. I'm told the ox tails and rice are amazing. I shall return!!!!!!  

Happy Camper!"}
{"text":"Great Drinks!!!!!!!!!!!! Asian Glazed wings were fantastic! Wonderful atmosphere! Wait staff was very nice and Peter Thomas was there working hard."}
{"text":"Great interior, vibe, and music.  Plenty of flat screen televisions that broadcast multiple games at once.  The drinks and food are good.  The chicken wings, calamari, and sliders just to name a few.

The only thing that hurts this joint is the service.  It is slow.  Slow for drink re-orders or refills.  Extremely slow on food orders.  Get this piece tightened up and it will be solid."}
{"text":"My first time at this establishment will most likely be my last. I went there yesterday for brunch to celebrate the birthday of a friend and we received some of the worst service ever from our server; though, her support staff (bussers, hostess, etc.) were wonderful. I did not catch our server's name because she never introduced herself or read the specials options to our table, but she is easily identifiable by her bright crimson colored hair. She spoke so softly we often had to ask her to repeat herself and she acted as if that was a chore or as if she was too good to be serving our table, often hiding at the register and ignoring our requests. She even had the audacity to roll her eyes at us multiple times and comment under her breath while walking away. 

While we had a larger party of 11 people, we were very relaxed and understood that service might take longer because it appeared as though this restaurant was designed more for parties of 2-4. With that being said, 20+ minutes for 11 waters and 4 mimosas to be delivered is ridiculous, especially when the restaurant is not even nearly full. I would not recommend ordering the \"bottomless mimosa\" as they are NEVER refilled without you having to ask; even with two bussers checking on the table. 

I am not sure what time they start serving brunch on Sunday but our reservation was for 1pm. By this time they had run out of ingredients for the regular menu items (bananas for the French Toast with Fried Bananas and Rum Sauce) as well as drink ingredients (cherries for mimosas). This would have been ok if our server had told us that the kitchen had run out of bananas either before we ordered (again, she never reviewed the specials or asked if we had questions about the menu) or after entering our orders into the system (a good chef will always let service staff know which items or ingredients are 86'd for the day). We had no idea the french toast would be served without bananas until it was placed in front of us and we had to ask about it; then we were asked if we had ordered it without bananas. A good server will know what is and isn't available, a good chef/cook will make sure the front of the house staff is informed of menu changes. But again, this server seemed more interested in her hair color than in actually being good at her job. I would like to compliment the busser who made a valiant effort and ran to the closest grocery store to get cherries for the drinks. His effort was noted and helped make up for the lack if good service by other staff. 

Luckily the woman next to me asked about specials before we ordered and our server very quietly only read them to us. I was under the impression that she then went to the other side of the table and reviewed them with our other guests, she did not; is anyone surprised? I ordered the Lobster Gravy and Biscuits and when it arrived one of our guests commented that she had not seen it on the menu. When I told her that it was a special she replied that no one had informed that end of the table about specials. How does a restaurant expect to make money if it's servers are not pushing the specials which are normally (and were on this occasion) the more expensive items?

When our food finally arrived, an hour after we were seated, it was staggered and obvious that the kitchen had been holding some of it in a failed attempt to deliver everything at once. It took approximately 10 minutes for them to serve 11 people. Many of our orders were messed up or confused, extra items were delivered, and main ingredients were missing as previously mentioned. One of our guests even had to remind the staff of what she ordered because they brought the wrong entree. Nothing that was served looked that special and I can tell you the lobster gravy and biscuits wasn't what it was cracked up to be. 

After our meals were delivered by other staff members our server never asked how the food was, we had to ask for missing items (including flatware) and refills on waters/mimosas. I honestly felt bad for our server's support staff because they were very obviously carrying her workload for her as she hid at the far end of the bar or at the table next to us chatting with who appeared to be her friends. 

45 minutes after our plates were cleared by the bussers we finally caught our server's attention and asked for our bills, after mentioning to two other staff that our mimosas were empty and we had asked our server for refills. Her excuse was something about the bartender needing to make them because she could no longer pour them from the carafe.  When we had finally paid and she brought back our change/credit card slips, the change was not correct. Apparently this restaurant thinks it is ok to \"round\" the change to an even number; and even number in their favor! So after having 18% gratuity automatically added for crappy service and ok food, this server was not helping the restaurant, or maybe herself, to an additional $.50 or more per customer."}

{"text":"I finally got to visit Sports One in Charlotte. I came for the Super Bowl 50 Event and started here! The level of professionalism was definitely set the moment you walk to the door. It's a small building but the layout is modern chic. 

This event had seats reserved because of the Super Bowl event, very limited seated already. So we did stand. But the vibe made us comfortable so standing was the last thing we were thinking about. Our bartender made our drinks to PERFECTION! We drank the classic Long Island Ice Tea and Margarita which were done right consistently. We met the owner of the place, Peter Thomas, Reality TV Star Husband, Cynthia Bailey. He was very down to earth and welcomed us. 

I will be going back to get a personal more intimate visit when there isn't much of a crowd. But for the first visit, I'll never forget! I enjoyed my self for sure!"}
{"text":"The drinks are always good!  The service is great and the food is good as well!  I must admit that I never expected food from a sports bar to taste so good!  This place is gets it right every time!  I will most certainly return!"}
{"text":"Hostess was not very good at hosting--ignored patrons (except one she happened to be flirting with) the rest of us were left waiting. Finally had to approach her to get seated. Then she tells us all tables that are empty are open. 3 minutes later some lady comes up to my party and rudely says that the table we were seated at was reserved and the party was there so we needed to leave. We left and took our money elsewhere. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"First of all this place had a great atmosphere that connected both the grown and sexy crowd together with the sports crowd. I ate at the bar and enjoyed the panthers game and the food. Definitely coming back here again in the future."}
{"text":"I came to this bar from out of town because I wanted to have fun in a city I never been before. The bar was very crowded and we could only get one drink because the bar was so crowded with people I couldn't get through. I really wanted to spend money but I couldn't because it was so many people blocking the bar. Not enough room to enjoy myself. I ended up going somewhere else so I could get a drink."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the mature and rather fun atmosphere. The food and drinks created a pleasurable evening. Definitely bringing my husband next time."}
{"text":"Shrimp & Grits, bottomless mimosas, purse hooks and an outlet under the bar to charge your phone. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting from NYC and decided to try out Peter's spot. We sat out on the patio hoping to order some food and drinks. The music was good. We sat and waited and waited. Finally my friend went to the bar to grab a menu then we were able to request additional menus from the busser and he said he would send a waitress over. We placed our order for food and drinks and requested water. Then we waited waited waited. The patio was hot and we were dehydrated and we did not understand why WATER was taking so long. Some of the staff came to check on us and we kept saying we didn't get our water and they would say okay without going to get the damn water. Eventually after not getting water or the food and drinks we ordered we had to just leave. My friend spoke to the manager and instead of resolving the issue right then and there she started bad talking her staff and dancing and telling us to come back the next day for brunch. So unprofessional. We saw Peter on the way out and he could of tried to resolve the issue with us as well but he was acting stand off ish. But he did look sexy lol.

Horrible service. Ppl really need to understand how to properly run a business and how to resolve issues to always make customers leave happy. Smdh!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 90's brunch to celebrate my birthday and had a blast!  The atmosphere is great and the staff was awesome too!  Everyone in my group was happy with their meals and drinks!  If you're getting mimosas the carafe is the way to go!  The chicken is delicious and is seasoned just right.  We even got to see Mr. Peter before we left.  He was very friendly, took pictures with us, asked if we enjoyed ourselves and wished me a happy birthday!  We will definitely be back! My only regret is that I had never been to the lounge before this visit.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"The waitresses are rude. They seem to feel a sense of entitlement...NOT SURE WHY. However, i recommend spending your time and money where it will be appreciated...elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really hate to give one star for SportsOne because the food was fantastic. The service on the other hand, was the worst. I never ask for a manager to complain about an employee, but tonight I did. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar. Our waitress was Anika and she was awesomely terrible! She paid very little attention to us, unless I waved her over. This was the worst experience I've had in quite a long time. While I would give this spot one more try, I wouldn't sit at the bar if she's bartending."}
{"text":"This is a great night spot for the 30 plus crowd. There is a parking lot but its not that big. You can have some tasty food and good drinks. I had the quesadillas which were delicious. I came on a Saturday night and it was packed. They had a porch  area. I didn't really use that space. I was able to get a spot at the bar. The staff and crowd were nice and chilled. The dj was cool. I got a pic with the owner who is a former housewives hubby. He was helpful in assisting me in using my own phone lol- Go figure. There was no cover charge which is amazing. It allows me to spend more on drinks and have a better time. I will probably return to try the breakfast everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"The people at the front desk are friendly. The place is small but well decorated. The wait staff is very friendly but a little slow. It's possible they are new to waiting as they seemed pretty young.  My drink which was a coconut margarita was very good. A bit over priced but very good. I ordered a turkey burger. Unfortunately it was a regular burger they were trying to pass off as turkey.  My friend said it was one as well. When I mentioned it to the waitress they were completely convinced it was turkey. Even took it back. I didn't eat it or make a big deal because I won't be eating the food there again. The best thing was the fries. I was disappointed. It's a cool spot to chill but overpriced. They also rarely have any events there which keeps people away from visiting. Not sure why it's like that but maybe that's their business model."}
{"text":"Here from California and we dined here for Mother's Day Brunch. We were disappointed this place lacked ambience and was bare. No flowers given to the Mothers, no flowers on the table nothing special for the Mothers. We had to beg our waitress for hot coffee without alcohol. She said they did not have hot tea or plain coffee. Peters Brew has alcohol. Grammy is 96 yrs young and all she could have was water for nonalcoholic drink?
We all had chicken and waffles. Waffles were cold, very large portions. We were not impressed."}
{"text":"Basically - this place is way too hyped up for what it is. For starters, I was drinking out of a plastic wine glass. Um, what? I was told they often break. Again, what? And? Is this not a grown up establishment? I met a group for a quick celebration (this place was not my choice). At first friendly bartenders and wait staff was a way to overlook the \"plastic\". However, our table was consistently with empty glasses or just ice. My food was late. And I never received one of the items. This is totally not glamorous as it is advertised to be, regardless for whom it is owned by."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I'm the area. Parking lot is small but FREE. The atmosphere is a step up from what I would consider a \"sports bar\" I love the patio seating and every Saturday is a \" I love the 90's\" brunch. The food is delicious, service is prompt and always good music. I've gone at different times during the day and night and it is never an extremely long wait always just the right amount of people. Great place to vibe !"}
{"text":"So while visiting Charlotte small group decided to come here for a late afternoon meal and drinks. Jerk chicken with cabbage, rice & peas! (who knew a Sports Bar would offer Caribbean Fare) It was quite good, extremely spicy.. but good. We also had the Momosas. After indulging, we were informed that the \"Peters Brew\" coffee was a must try! You cant have afternoon coffee without dessert?? So, the fried Cheesecake was added to my cheat day list... lol. The cheesecake was just ok, more like fried dough with a cream cheese center. But the coffee, I must say stole the show! Delicious. I will be ordering more online for home brewing!"}
{"text":"Gets 2 stars because I didn't die or get food poisoning. $25 brunch with plastic cups/ plastic champagne glasses, with mismatched silverware and wobbling tables!  I came with a friend for Saturday brunch. Upon being seated waitress informed us, there were no eggs (correction: the eggs would take at least an hour, as the chef was on his way with them). Service was sub par, at best. Order was incomplete and wrong... Waitress response: \"but, oh I can get that if you still want it. Owners (Peter and Carlos) were on site... I only know this, not because they were friendly and/ or thanking patrons... But because they were sitting at a corner table being obnoxiously loud and disruptive with a large group."}
{"text":"Nice decor, music, and drinks. Came in on a Friday night and then again for Saturday brunch. For brunch I had the chicken and waffles, grits and a side of bacon. Everything was outstanding and the service was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have come to Sports One twice in the last few weeks. The first time a girlfriend and I ended up looking for a nice spot to grab a drink on Saturday night. I arrived and was a little confused about the parking. It appears that they have a parking lot but then they also had valet. I didn't want to pay for valet seeing that I didn't know how much it was and ended up paying for parking nearby. When we arrived we realized you needed to reserve a table so we just ate at the bar. The bartender was super nice and fixed our drinks. I ordered the CB. It was pretty good but was served in a small glass and I did not think it was worth 12 dollars. The specialty drinks seemed a bit overpriced. I then decided on a side Caesar salad and flat bread. It took longer than expected for my food to come out but it was pretty tasty when it did arrive. My friend had the wings and she enjoyed those as well

The second time I came there was an event hosted by another group and it was during the week. I didn't see any valet so I parked in the parking lot beside the building. Apparently they only do valet on Fri and Saturday. We asked for a table and after a few mins we were seated across from the bar. I once again ordered the salad because I wasn't too hungry but my friends ordered the salmon bites and shrimp pasta. My friend thought that the salmon bites needed something extra she was expecting something like a crab cake and the other really enjoyed her shrimp pasta.
This place has a really nice atmosphere and the staff are pretty attentive. I will be back soon . I just wish they had more parking or validated parking or something.


**I have just learned that the valet parking is free. I had no idea at the time, next time I will use the valet! **"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Every dish is great! My personal favorite... I joke and tell all my friends that the chef must've came directly from heaven lol!"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on a Saturday for 90's brunch. The atmosphere felt like home, I'm from Cali and we don't have many spots like this. The music was good, the drinks were average and the food was delicious. I tasted the shrimp and grits and the smothered pork chops and grits...both were amazing. Seen Peter walking around that was super cool to see that he actually shows face. 

Con- customer service was so/so...some staff were stank, some were very nice and our waiter was very slow. 

I would go back and recommend"}
{"text":"I come here on the regular and it's 5 stars but today it's 95+ degrees and the air either wasn't on or broke. I was miserable but the music is always on point."}
{"text":"I ordered food and drinks at the bar (the strawberry Hennessey lemonade was really really really good). The bartender rung me up with a bill which was $51. I paid her and left an $8 tip. After a few minutes I realized that something didn't add up. The price on the menu shows $37 and not $51. When I called her over to fix the problem She says  \"because it's really crowded tonight we are adding gratuity to everything. Huh?!? I also realized that she never printed out a receipt. She just made up her own price. So you mean to tell me I just gave this woman an extra $22.  Never will I ever recommend this place to anyone. She killed my vibe so I had to leave."}
{"text":"My Dish was to die for the sauce that's on the salmon was s perfect match the yellow rice was cook to perfection and the vegetables were season to a great taste. This was a great experience !!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sports One Bar & Lounge quite a few times! The music is great, and the crowd is very mature. No bad experiences here....I love how clean this place is, I am impresses. I finally had a chance to order food.....Today I had their brunch....BTW $5 Mimosas on Saturdays!! #Winning I also ordered the Shrimp and Grits ($15) Yes it was filling.....I need to eat here more often, the food is fantastic. I also had a chance to meet Peter Thomas (from The Real Housewives of Atlanta) Really nice guy. Of course EVERYONE was taking pictures with him. I decided to give him a break, lol!!! Peter mentioned there is going to be another \"Sports One Bar\" next door for members only, I plan to signup for a membership! I really like the staff here, always accommodating. I wish Peter Thomas and his businesses all the best....This man clearly knows what he's doing."}
{"text":"I was hoping that this was going to be a great, close by spot, with a cool social vibe and great drinks. I took my sisters who were visiting from out of town because my one sister is a fan of Housewives of ATL and had heard of the restaurant. 

We went on a Sunday and learned they have a Sunday brunch menu. I was a bit surprised that the hostess asked if we had reservations, but was like \"ok, it is brunch and it isn't a large establishment\". What I didn't like is the pretentious way that she asked. I HATE Hostesses act like that, like they are doing you a freakin favor by letting you spend YOUR MONEY there. But I told myself to relax since I didn't want to spoil it for my sister.

The 2nd hostess looked around the corner and quickly invited us to be seated...in the half empty/full restaurant. SMH

Service was a bit slow and it took a while for someone to take our Oder after being seated. My sisters ordered the salmon. Unfortunately, they assumed at brunch in the south a dish they includes salmon and eggs meant salmon cakes. Even still, they both were unimpressed with their dishes and the eggs were not served as they requested. I had the fish and grits which I thought was decent, the fish was flavorful.

We also had libations. The Queen City Margarita was the bomb and would be a good reason for me to go back. The sangria was also good. 

I would say the place is more of a lounge/restaurant vs a sports bar."}
{"text":"A great idea but poor execution. The place has the potential to want to be a great place, but the service, or lack there of, and the size leaves a lot to be left to the imagination. The night started off great, the police officer even paid for me to enter. Not sure if it was because he thought my girl was pretty, and he couldn't stop looking at her butt, or it was because he said I look like Ceelo Green. Anyway, he said big boys winning now, keep it up..lol. That's about where the two stars comes from. Once you turn the corner, you get the feeling of trying to walk thru a mosh pit..crazy crowded and small. We were lucky that somebody was leaving at the end of the bar close to the dance floor, and said we could have their seats. We had to wait about 30 mins to get the bartender attention. She said hold on, but never looked our way again. My failure to understand how you can have a packed bar with three of the slowest bartenders is very perplexing. A young man standing behind me had ordered a drink, but was fussing that it cost $15, and that it was more juice than alcohol. The bartender called for security I guess. They came and pretty much tried to put him in a full Nelson. Which really wasn't called for, if he didn't like  the drink, he didn't like the drink.. so still sitting empty handed for a hour, I finally was able to place a order. I ordered two double shots of patron and a double shot of Grand Marnier. Needless to say by the time the bartender came back, she said it was gonna be last call. Dang, so we in this camp for a hour and a half already and still haven't gotten a drink yet, but you saying it's last call. So crowded couldn't even get up to dance, and you had to push your way to the bathroom. Oh, and for those three drinks? $96 without tip. I felt bad cause I only gave a $9 tip but the girl felt that I left them $8.50 too much. The owners need to figure out how to maximize the space, maybe take out the tables after a certain time or something. Just reminds you of a Jamaican club in Brooklyn with how small it is. But land is a helluva lot cheaper in Charlotte than New York."}
{"text":"Hostess was kind of slow at first on a Sunday afternoon after the Hornets vs Raptors game. Our server was good. Ordered salmon bites with grits, scrambled eggs, French toast (fruit), and chicken and waffles. 

Parking was ample, and the atmosphere was enjoyable. I recommend to any professional who loves mingling or watching sports."}
{"text":"I had a blast here! The food, drinks, atmosphere is awesome. It's definitely the place to be in Charlotte. A must visit if you come for the night life."}
{"text":"Here at present and having the worst experience...waitress tried to up sell me on some lemonade when all I wanted was water. The wrong food was brought to me (ordered a shrimp wrap for $13, was brought the $15 salmon wrap and my fries were cold) and she took it away but brought it back and asked if I could just 'work on it' while they make me a new sandwich with no guarantee of fresh fries....worst experience EVER!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with high expectations that we would have a wonderful time, get great service and experience good food.  My family traveled from NY, GA, and SC for a birthday celebration.  We had a reservation for approximately 10 people but once we arrived, the very rude host with her breast all out stated that if we were going to eat together that we had to spend collectively $350 with a minimum of 2hrs of sit time.  (What kind of Tom Harold BS is that when you are spending money?) She also stated that once our 2 hrs were up, we had to remove ourselves from the table and either hang around at the bar or go on the patio, mind you, this place is already small as heck.  Anyway, we decided to stay in spite of, because we were determined to have a Great Time!  Our server Monie was absolutely fabulous and we were all impressed with her knowledge of the menu and her memorizing everything from appetizers, drinks, and entrees without having written a thing down,  so Kudos to Monie!!  The DJ was fantastic so Monie and the DJ were the only great experiences we had.  Disappointed with the drinks.  My glass of Malbec was brought out in a filthy glass so rather than have them change my glass and pour the same wine in it, I just had a fresh glass of white wine.  

The appetizers were disgusting!!!  The Salmon bites were hard and crispy, wings were bland, turkey sliders had no flavor and were also dry.  The crab spinach dip was the worst I'd ever tasted.  Waaaaaaaaay too much cheddar which is an unusual ingredient to put in crab spinach dip.  You could not taste the spinach nor the crab meat.  The salmon entrees, however, were pretty tasty, the nutrients were cooked out of the veggies which meant that they were overcooked. The kale collard greens were super sweet and just disgusting. Most of us had to have the food taken back because our apps and entrees were cold.  French fries had to be sent back as well because they too were cold.  The drinks were So fricking horrible!!  The host and other servers were twerking at the host stand, a huge depiction of a very unprofessional setting.  Safe to say that WE will NEVER EVER be back and will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Charlotte area. I've been looking for local hot spots I can go and unwind.  I came across this venue on yelp and thought it might be the cool laidback atmosphere I was looking for .  Since I'm an early bird, I arrived at 7pm on a Saturday. Lounge is pretty much empty. Expected since most people don't leave their homes until 11. But that may be a new York mentality. I digress. Sitting at the bar the service is subpar. If you want to chase down the bartenders this is your place. It's like I'm invisible. I will say when I finally got my Queen City Martini, it was delicious. I think they definitely need to improve their staff as they don't even have friendly faces."}
{"text":"The music is live but the food is bland.  The chicken wings & eggs were not seasoned. Don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"I compliment the place on the illusion that it creates with the mirror when you walk in, but it ends there because it is just an illusion the place is very small. I'm glad it was not packed when we arrived but for some reason service still managed to be slow. 

They also had kids running around which is the last thing you would expect at a bar, but you can't blame the owners I guess that's the parents call. 

Our server started off great but apparently when I asked for honey mustard, that was supposed to come with my turkey burger, it  must have triggered her negative attitude. 

The food was great though no complaints there.

I really wanted to like this place but when it comes to spending my money customer service is never an option it's a requirement and you don't get that here."}
{"text":"Best Lemon Pepper Wings I've ever had! Nice size wings - well seasoned. Not wet. - not too dry. A group of girlfriends and I swung by after a concert at the Filmore. My friend that lives in Charlotte loves this spot . We sat on the patio that was nice and relaxing. A panthers game was on but during commercials a DJ was mixing some great 90s and newer music . Once the game was over - we were able to submit a few request before the spot closed. It felt like we had our own VIP section. We saw Peter for a brief minute. 

I look forward to coming back for brunch and or dinner to try their full menu"}
{"text":"Came to Sports One with my guy for brunch on Saturday, March 4th. The atmosphere was great. There was a live DJ and people enjoying themselves either eating or mingling. The food was good but I wish the portions were a little bigger. Within 2 hrs or so me and my guy was hungry again. However, overall this place is a great place to go to."}
{"text":"Food was good. The servers were friendly but slow! The biggest surprise of the day was that they had no beers on tap! A sports bar with no draft beer!?!? SMH!"}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday, several drinks ordered as well as food yet being rushed to finish....three servers and a manager (?) came by the table before we were finished with our meals to take plates.  Felt rushed not wanted!  Bartenders unable to make a basic drink - Moscow mule - other cocktails on the menu were subpar.  This bar NOT lounge could have potential IF changes are made.  Won't be back any time soon....."}
{"text":"The service was poor. Order chicken wings that were raw, talk to manager and she stated the cook said they were ok...so they are ok.  I order a cocktail, grey goose with a splash of cranberry, it did not taste like that AT ALL, I suspect it was water down a bit.  

Traveled to Charlotte for a game and wanted to visit the restaurant to see what the hype was. I was soooooo disappointed in everything about it.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I went to Sports One on a friends recommendation and urging not to stay in my hotel room . I must say it exceeded my expectations. The bartender Sy was super friendly. It's always nice to be a patron and the employees know what they're talking about....and she definitely does. I had the maple honey salmon and apple crisp both of which were delicious. The bar offers a great atmosphere and hospitality...I would recommend anyone to stop in for the drinks and eats. They also had karaoke....my fav"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating food from this restaurant both times were not the best of experience. The first time I ate inside was decent but food took forever for it not to be a lot of people. The second time I decide for take out it was Saturday so it was busier which I understood but when I called multiple times the hostess told me to hold which I did but while on hold no one ever came back to the phone  I was on hold for a total of 40 mins which was the time it took me to get to the restaurant I proceeded to stay on hold as I was going inside to see how much longer I would actually be on hold as I got to the hostess table I ask who answers the phones and she told me everybody ok sounds fair mind you I'm still on hold she told me she would grab a waitress for me to take my order so I hung up to sit waiting on the waitress for another 15 mins so I decided to call in once again to my surprise guess who answer the phone the hostess who's answered the phone all the other times so she tries to put me on hold again and I told her y'all keep putting me on hold and I guess she realize it was me and starting laughing then she said oh if you tip me I'll let you in so I was like are you serious but I told her I'll pay it after I order my food. So as I go in to talk to a waitress the first one I spoke to I said hey can you take my order for me to go I'll take care of you with a tip she said ok and walks off and never came back to talk to me as she passed by me on multiple occasions but anyway I ask another Adrienne who was very polite and had no problem taking my order. Thanks Adrienne for being so nice and professional. I understand you guys are busy on the weekends but if that's the case you guys should not offer take out in my opinion but who am I to say"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Saturday night and the place was slammed. I figured with this many people, they must be doing something right... The food, service, and overall atmosphere was awesome. Just when you think there's only so many ways you can fry shrimp, you're wrong, OMG! The fried shrimp and salmon bites are out of this world. We also had calami, wings, quesadillas, and the sliders. This is the first time I've eaten somewhere and can honestly say everything I ate was delicious. Between Liam our server and one of the owner's, everyone kept checking on us to make sure we had an amazing experience from start to finish. Being a large party and getting that kind of attentiveness on a Saturday night is not normal; we were pleasantly surprised and very grateful for the perfect evening. If you're looking for a sexy, upscale vibe with great food and service, this is it... 5 star."}
{"text":"Came to support the small businesses and watch the playoffs! But nope, they said Karaoke night is more important... Yikes! But the staff was nice despite the fact that they couldn't turn on the game sound"}
{"text":"Beat my expectations. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, delicious food and drinks at a good price. I'll definitely visit again. My husband and I enjoyed ourselves and can't wait to return for a special event!"}
{"text":"Myself and three others ladies dined here for brunch during CIAA weekend, so of course they were super busy, but we had a decent time.  My friend had made pre-existing reservations, so we were seated quickly once our entire group arrived.  On this particular day they had a sign on the table that indicated you had two hours to eat, and then you needed to depart.  I'm assuming this was so they could serve as many patrons as possible.

Our table was in the bar area; be warned the tables and seating are super close together so plan to be cozy with your neighbors.  They had a select menu for brunch, and unfortunately had already run out of chicken for the chicken and waffles dish.  We all decided on other options, mine being the French toast.  The portions were kind of small, but it was pretty good.  The DJ and the music were the highlight of the brunch experience; however, if he could have turned it down a notch or two it would have been perfect.  It was difficult to carry on a conversation (we were sitting right across from each other) and we frequently found ourselves yelling.  The old school R&B tunes set the perfect vibe though!

As others mentioned, the service here is lacking and needs some work.  Our waitress was nice but we barely saw her and had to continually flag her down to ask for things.  I've been here previously for drinks one evening, and it seemed like I had a better experience then.  The place has potential but needs to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my friends today even after reading the reviews. We finally parking after being forced to download and app because we did not have cash. After that we enter the restaurants and was seated immediately. 

We waited a while for someone to greet us and even offer us water. When she finally came, she was really sweet but she never gave us her name. The food took forever to come out and we had the bottomless mimosa which she took forever to refill. 

When the food finally came out it was good. I had the breakfast panini and my friend had the shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles, they equally enjoyed it. 

I just think this place needs a little work in the service area. A lot of potential but probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm in town for CIAA weekend and didn't want to go to a club last night so my friend suggested Sports One. There was a nice mix of 30+ people. DJ 06 was awesome. His set had me dancing most of the night since he played a mix of hip hop, R&B and 90s reggae. The drinks are expensive but strong and will knock you  on your ass if you are not careful. It's a small and tight space so be warned. The only negative - the women bartenders cater to the men and do not make eye contact with women patrons. It is hard to order if you cannot get their attention. I had to ask a couple of guys to order drinks for us. I liked the vibe and music so I will be back."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 5:00 pm but ended up changing to 3:30 pm and we were accommodated quickly. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive. We waited awhile for the food but everything came out correctly, the only issue was some of the food was not hot on arrival but the waitress quickly corrected this for us. The food was delicious and the portions were a nice size. The owner was very friendly and interacted with our party quite a bit, he even sat down and chatted with us for awhile; which was greatly appreciated. The music and overall vibe was on point, next time I'm in Charlotte I will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food was great. The wait for the food was WAAAAYYYYYY too long. We waited 1.5 hours for food."}
{"text":"So me and a couple of my girlfriends went to this spot over the weekend. It was awesome! We had such a good time. The DJ was great and the bartenders were really cool and attentive. I expected it to be bigger, but once we got inside and got settled we didn't even notice lol. It could've been the drinks, but I think it was the atmosphere and the music that truly took us over. I can't wait to go back and see if the vibe is the same lol."}
{"text":"SportsOne, is just what the doctor ordered for Charlotte's nightlife. With a few adjustments, it could bring that 3 star average up to a 5. I visited three times and the comments below are what was observed consistently.

The good news is that the venue makes the most in the space given. The food is tasty. Go for the salmon bites. My grilled shrimp was too salty and the portion in the appetizer was small (6 shrimp).

The bad news is the service STRUGGLES. Despite being adequately staffed, waitresses kept disappearing for way too long! The place isn't that big, so how they manage to evade eyesight for so long is beyond me. However, I thought they were nice when present. 

Valet, while complimentary, is odd at this location because all spaces are close to the building and there is ample parking on site. Every time I used valet (which is mandatory on Fri./Sat.), my car was parked about 15 ft from the entrance and I could've walked to my car sooner than the time it took to wait for valet to get it. I understand it's part of the more upscale experience, but it's not efficient here.

On average, Drinks $12. Appetizers $10. Entrees $18."}
{"text":"So I know it just opened and will need some time to get things to flow for the people of Charlotte. I love the atmosphere. This is a grown and sexy environment and could definitely be a good spot for hanging out for African Americans.  The food was okay. A couple of things were good (salmon bites, asian wings) and some other things were just okay. A couple of things held me back from giving it one more star. 1) the Manager came over to tell us that there was a 2 hour limit on the table. We had reservations at which no time did anyone tell us there was a 2 hour limit on the table and as everyone else can attest to, the service is very slow so we had been at the table longer than the 2 hours not because we wanted to but because that was how long it was taking for us to be served. Needless to say, he came over to tell us that he would need to enforce this rule should anyone show up.  This was after we had just paid our bill and there was no one else waiting. If he had taken any type of management 101 he would have been able to tell that we were getting ready to leave so he could have avoided that all together. And even when I expressed that his coming over, ruined the energy at the table, he offered to help the situation. One of my other girlfriends had been billed for 1 too many drinks and he said he was going to remove it from our bill. He NEVER came back to the table. 2.) our server sat down and had a 20 min conversation with guests on 2 occasions during our visit. We couldn't believe it! and it would have been cool had everyone at the table have everything...3. Valet -- you have to walk to your car to get it...what type of valet is that...Like I said, I know they are new but they really need to work on a couple of things and I may go back in a couple of months to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  The wait staff and bartenders were very rude. They bartenders continously ignored us so it took 20 minutes of waving my hand and saying \"excuse me\" for her to acknowledge me. Later in the night we ordered drinks from a waitress hoping for better customer service.   Well, we waited about 45 minutes for our drinks to come which they never did. So, we had find the waitress and get our money back. And she had the nerve to have an attitude and hadn't even put our drink orders in yet. The establishment is very small and gets crowded fast. I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"We call it the \"office\" because we frequent this place so often. Great for just a casual night out with friends. It was even open during our \"ice storm\". Can be seen as a local watering hole, but I would say it's better then that. Salmon bites are always fire! And now I have made friends with a couple of the bartenders who are always right on time with the drinks!"}
{"text":"Came from Philly and just wanted to try this place! Very disappointed in the food. The Service and staff were good. We had the salmon bites and they were frost bitten. The turk y sliders were ok. We wanted to order the truffle fries but they didn't have any fries. The web site also boasted Thursday night was R&B. The Dj was late.  It is located across from a homeless shelter. Save your time and money! Not recommended for the homeless either."}
{"text":"Wow I was surprised  that the food here was absolutely delicious. We ordered a variety of food at brunch. The best was a daily special of Red Velvet Pancakes, they contained chocolate chips and were drizzled with a strawberry cream cheese topping. The Fish and Grits had a unique flavor. The grits were creamy and smooth. I enjoyed everything in my table and plate."}
{"text":"The food was good but the table availability was not the best. I definitely recommend going when they aren't busy and getting the shrimp and grits with the Hennessy lemonade."}
{"text":"Was really hyped about coming here to celebrate my sister's upcoming nuptials until the foolery ensued. First off we had reserved a table for ten on 12 Aug 17 at 1100 pm after dinner. We were running late because of an Uber issue but that's another story, in which we notified the manager and got an okay. Upon our arrival there was someone sitting at our RESERVED table that we had to sit and wait for (that was paid for). By this time I'm fuming and trying to remain professional.  Our party was then refunded our reservation fee and told by the manager that she would take care of us the rest of the night. That wasn't the case. We were stuck with a $400 tab. I'll NEVER patronize this establishment as long as there's life in my body. They lack serious interpersonal skills."}
{"text":"Nice music, good vibe and average food. The cocktails were decent but the food could have been better. I love being greeted by friendly sisters that appear to like their jobs. Overall I would definitely patronize this bar again"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday Brunch. Food came out relatively quick. Very well cooked with good seasoning. The shrimp and grits were made well. Very tasty. The waffle and chicken was good too, but the wings were so tasty I forgot about the waffles.. Stick w/ just the wings. Service was stellar to my surprise considering some of the comments about this place. Brunch starts at 11AM and my party arrived at 1130 and 1 other table was sat so the place was empty. Numbers did increase after noon but service was great for our table. First time at this spot. Not bad. Check them out."}
{"text":"Slow rude hostess.  I don't like to pay this much to be treated so rude and wait an hour for Anither drink."}
{"text":"I love the food & the atmosphere of all the staff plus  the way the salmon eggs and French toast was setup damn make you want to slap someone and that chicken was on point"}
{"text":"I had the salmon bites and grits. The salmon bites are amazing. I loved the stone ground grits. Also they have one of the best deals on mimosas. No complaints."}
{"text":"I really was excited about this lounge and was highly disappointed. I never even got to taste the food as I was treated very rude.  I sat at the bar for a long time and was not even acknowledged; it wasn't even busy it was a Tuesday!  I ended up walking out, doubt they even realized my absence smh. The service is subpar and so is the image of some workers. Really disappointed. We have to do better."}
{"text":"My first time there. It was a very nice atmosphere and cozy feeling. A good size for a small crowd and it has a very tiny dance floor. Only thing was the food and drinks are expensive, although good but just a bit pricey. Overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"Great decor, good food, kinda reasonable prices. The only thing that I would STRONGLY suggest is to turn the music down so that people can hear their date or fellow patron speak. I could not even hear the server in her attempt to make suggestions from the menu. Otherwise, nice venue."}
{"text":"Service is SUPER SLOW.  I had to get up from my table and go to the bar to order food and drinks.  We have been here for 40 minutes and not one server has approached us.  AND IT IS HOT AS HELL IN HERE!  This is too stressful after a week of work.  And the bartender just handed my food to someone else to hand to me.  I'm done!  And my wing was reheated.  I got two orders of wings, an order of fries, a glass of wine, and a sangria for $50.17.  No you cannot give me reheated food."}
{"text":"Again Earl Thomas was a great host.  Mr. Thomas introduced himself, had a fantastic time talking with him.  If you go during Saturday brunch which ends around 3pm you will have a great time.  He even addressed my complaint that I wrote about Club One.  Gave some great entrepreneur advice as well as relationship advice.  Sometime you just have to give places time and opportunities to make things better.  Service was great, I will be going back.  I was truly impressed with his professionalism and how down to Earth he is."}
{"text":"I've gone to Sports One Bar & Lounge twice and both times I have really enjoyed myself.  The bar/lounge was small which gave it an intimate feel and it's very nice.  I sat at the bar and each time I went, the waitress and waiter were personable and accommodating with prompt service.  I ordered the Jerk chicken with rice and both were amazing!  The food tasted as if I were visiting Jamaica.  Literally. Authentic: which is important to me :) I  definitely would recommend this bar & lounge if you want to relax and get out of the house.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Upon entry you're greeted by a smiling hostess and sunlit interior with a modern chic design. Popular 90's music played in the background. I sat at the bar within seconds the bartender provided a drink and brunch menu. Nice selection of drinks!  Several healthy options for calorie conscious diners. Fried food lovers beware of the many choices! This visit served as a much needed #cheatday. I chose fried chicken wings. In no time my wings were served piping hot..well seasoned, crispy outside, tender and juicy inside. Taste wise I'd say these wings are tasty. They aren't necessarily delicious. 

Based on the service and cool environment alone I'd visit again. The bartenders are attentive, lively, great attitudes and hard workers. Sometimes it's the staff that keep a place going!"}
{"text":"Oh heck no!!!!! I went to Sports One in Charlotte for brunch one Saturday in December 2016 for my homegirl's bday. All we wanted was good food and a good atmosphere but no we couldn't get that. I first ordered a Bloody Mary because I like to see who has the best bloody Mary's in Charlotte. I told the waitress to make it spicy if it wasn't already. The drink was okay, honestly im not going to go in on Sports One about the drink. There are too many other things to go in on them about. We all ordered our food it was about 9 people in our party. Everyone either ordered the shrimp and grits or the chicken and waffles. I order the chicken with waffles. I told the waitress to make my chicken wings fried extra crispy because this dish utilizes whole chicken wings. Everyone got their food at different times and I got my food last. I got my food about an hour and 15 min after I ordered it. It came to the point where we were all not even enjoying ourselves we were just talking to each other about the horrible service. Okay so I get my food. My waffle was the bomb . My chicken looked good but when I tried to pull it apart I was struggling which means that it was under done. And I told them to over cook the wings. Well I sent them back and when I sent mine back the person next to me said, hey send mine back too!!! So by the time I got my wings back everyone else had paid already. I was really mad, so I told the waitress to go get the manager. First of all knowing that people had waited for their food all that time the manager should have come to see if were were good on her own. The manager came to the table and said, \" someone sent for me?\" I said are u the manager? She said yes, I said what is your name??? Anyway I told her everyone got their food at different times. Even the first person who got their food first waited for like 30 min. I told her about my under cooked chicken and just the over all vibe. She took 15% off all out meals. She took my drink off and something else as well. My food came to $10. I gave the waitress a $5 tip. I may never go there again because with me, you can have a big name. I can hear about you on the radio or TV but when I come there the food and service better be on point or you won't see me again and I will tell everyone I know not to go there. And I'm just telling it how it happened. And yes this is Peter's place. I have nothing against him but a bad experience is a bad experience."}
{"text":"I recently came for brunch on Sunday. I had the bacon, egg, and cheese panini with breakfast potatoes. I thought it would have been on bread, but it actually came out in a pita like wrap. It was seasoned well and very cheesy. The potatoes were crispy and very good. My friend got the shrimp and grits and they were VERY good. 
This venue usually has a DJ at all times with some sort of sports playing on one of their several TVs. The atmosphere is good, drinks can be a bit pricey, and the food service is slow. 
Note: you must try the salmon bites."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a try twice before writing a review.  The first visit was within a couple of weeks after the grand opening.  The waitress was no where to be found when needed and I had to request my check at least 3 times.  In addition, there must have been an issue with the cushions in our seating area which triggered \"Peter\" asking everyone to stand so he could fluff the cushions(Total turn-off).  My last and final attempt to patron this restaurant was last Saturday.  This time the staff was attentive but my meal was  poorly prepared.  I've never eaten shrimp and grits in which I had to pull the tail off the shrimp.  In addition the grits were quite stiff and bland.  I didn't complain at that moment but I was definitely not pleased.  This dish certainly needs to be revamped."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Major downfall was waiting for food for close to an hour. Waitress did not interact with us at all. When asked about food she told us about 10 min, after over 20 min we left. Terrible extremely terrible. Bad first impression."}
{"text":"I've been twice! Love it. Nice atmosphere! Brunch is the best! Staff is very friendly & professional. Food was great...but those grits"}
{"text":"If you want your lady disrespected this is the place.  Food sub par and drinks watered down.  Outta here...."}
{"text":"Do not come here.  There was hair in my food....drinks watered down. Unprofessional. Peter thomas is a POS. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. Please do not give this man your money by wasting your time as this crap ass bar. If you're African American maybe it might be good but I'm asian American. It shouldn't matter right? To this place it did."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I was conflicted with my overall rating, because while I do recommend this place for after work, Friday & Saturday nights its a Zoo.

The Lounge: Its a VERY small place. Which works during the week, not so much on weekends. I was a little thrown by the pictures they chose to put on the walls. A bunch of half naked men. While I can appreciate a good looking man (i'm a female), it was a little weird for a sports bar. That throws me off each time I go there. If I was a man, I'd imagine that'd be a little annoying to see. There is an area in the front with couches that are VERY uncomfortable. I came with a group of females and not one enjoyed sitting that low and if you wanted to lean back you were basically laying down. Was not an attractive look.

Valet: Really makes no sense to me why they have this. During the week the place is so small that you can pull right in and park yourself right up front. On weekends, its so packed that they dont even let you turn in to have the option of valet. We had to pay $5 to park across the street.

The restrooms: During the week, clean. Weekends, neglected.

Crowd: The crowd is Mature and always very nice. Grown & Sexy!! They represent our city well. Handsome men and gorgeous women. 

After Work Dining: Surprisingly the food is SO good. I wasn't expecting that. And if you ask me they are really good prices. The Ribeye, Maple Lemon Glazed Salmon and Salmon Bites are a MUST. Very well seasoned. Just delicious. Now on the other hand, the drinks are EXPENSIVE! But good! Still not worth the price though. I spent $15 for ONE drink. They have a drink there on the menu with Cucumber in it. Its so refreshing. The bar Manager makes the BEST drinks and he is very friendly. The servers were very friendly and accommodating. But a lot of the times they are just standing around staring at you or at the bar. Food came out at a decent rate. Sometimes they have a DJ come and he plays alllll the jams! And because its an after work crowd, you can really enjoy it without it being crowded and extra loud. Tables are always available, no wait and a few people come in and chill at the bar. So we are pretty much always happy during our Happy Hour experiences. 

Friday/Saturday Nights: Its a mess on weekend nights. The service is extreeeeeemmmmeeeelyyyyy SLOW!!! On more than one occasion, I can be sitting in the front lounge area and the servers will come to deliver food or something to someone else and instead of checking on everybody else, they just walk out. Once I finally got ones attention and instead of helping me she said she'd be back. She never did. A few minutes later I saw her helping another table near the bar. When you are finally able to order a drink, be prepared to wait 20 minutes for it to come back. And the drinks are nowhere as good as they are on weeknights & they hike up the prices. Even one of the servers told me this. They are def watered down. Knowing how my drink is supposed to taste from coming weeknights, I sent my drink back 3 times and they all came back the same, just not good. Finally the bar manager came by and I told him and he made my drink the way it was supposed to be made and it was delicious. The DJ is still just as good on weekends. But being that its a weekend, people like to dance, and there is really no room to do so. You just gotta jig in your spot lol. 

I give it 4 stars. Because while I enjoy dinners there. I couldn't even imagine trying to eat there on Friday/Saturday nights as its a nightmare just trying to hang out! Definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and it's funny tol look at people complaining about how busy it is etc. Do you not want a great place like this to succeed? It's owned by Peter Thomas of Atlanta Housewives and he is there quite a bit for someone who lives two states away. Great food, fun environment - this place is hitting on all levels. From Thursday to Sunday morning (great brunch) it is packed. You NEED to be there."}
{"text":"Amazing Food and the new up and coming Uptown sports bar for the upscale crowd in Charlotte. If you are looking for a place to watch the games and also network this is the right place. Very intimate and chic. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great time."}
{"text":"SportsOne has become one of my top brunch spots in CLT. The ambiance is so chill and laid back. The decor plus the music sets a cool vibe for any time of the day you visit. Ive mostly visited for Sunday brunch and have tried almost every menu item. My favorite is the shrimp and grits. The food is great, always! 

I've only tried a few of the regular menu items but the few I've tried (wings and turkey sliders) have been tasty. The prices are a little on the high side but hey, you are uptown. Plus, I think the dining experience is of high quality so you have to pay for that. My only gripe is that the sit-down service could be a little more efficient. Outside of that, no complaints! Can't wait to check out the new club and bar the owners are opening up this spring!"}
{"text":"Soooo..... sports one i have been here a numerous amount of times before writing this actual review. Generally i would come on a saturday night when its super crowded almost a little too crowded given the amount of space this place has. Came here tonight on a wendsday after a hornets game to grab some bites and drinks. The food generally is good here for tonight given i could count the amount of people on one hand that was in here it took darn near 20 minutes to get our food the drinks of coarse came rather quickly. Red bottom mule is what i had which mules are my fav and this one was definetly tasty. I only have one complaint our food was cold! Being we waited for 20 minutes for our food, and their wasn't alot of customer in tonight, you would think it would be steaming hot. Im not going to hold that against this place, its a rather cool and laid back spot to eat,drink and chill! Peter the owner asked me about my hat i was rocking tonight,it hit me he is i think from brooklyn his self."}
