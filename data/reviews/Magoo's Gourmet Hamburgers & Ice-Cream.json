{"text":"Great burgers and great staff. The type of diner where entire families come to enjoy their favourite burgers and everyone leaves with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"I've been going to Magoo's for close to 2 decades and still think it's one of the best burger places in TO!  Even after having tried all the new trendier spots  - the best \"special sauce\" and awesome pickles !   Real cheese and nice selection of mustard. 

Nothing fancy - just really really good and fresh every time..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best burgers around, family run, fresh ingredients. Couldn't ask for more! Everything on the menu is worth a try, and the value for your dollar is fantastic."}
{"text":"Magoo's has been around about twenty years, but it seems a little older in spirit, what with its old-fashioned approach to burger-craft. That's certainly not a bad thing: it's a good place to get a quality burger around Dundas and Royal York, and it's funny how there isn't a McDonalds or anything nearby...

Magoo's does the usual burgers and burger-joint sides, as well as ice cream and real milkshakes. It's hard not to compare it to Lick's, and if you like Lick's, you'll probably like Magoo's too. Personally, I'd root for Magoo's a little bit harder since they're still truly local (if you ask me, Lick's sold out when they started selling their own brand of frozen patties in big chain supermarkets)."}
{"text":"This is a great burger place in Etobicoke, probably my favourite in the area to be honest.  It is an Etobicoke institution and deservedly so, unlike Apache Burger which has really gone downhill over the past few years.  Apache is great for a late night burger when you're drunk/high and want something \"better\" (lol) than McDicks or Wendys but given the choice between the two I'd pick Magoos any day as the quality far surpasses Apache.

The burgers are made fresh everyday and you can really tell a difference in quality.  The toppings are always fresh and not rotten looking, and they have great fries and onion rings that are not fried in old oil.  I really like the spicy fries with the special sauce.  They also have a variety of ice cream flavours and make amazing shakes.  It is a bit pricier than most burger places but you pay for what you get.

Have gone many times and will continue to in the future!"}
{"text":"The service was bad, like you're doing them a favour to eat there. Burgers were ok, nothing special but having cold cheese slapped on a warm patty was kinda gross. Milkshakes are very meh. Would not bother coming back."}
{"text":"I work in the same plaza where magoos is located. our staff visits this place a couple times a week. Everything is delicious. My colleague loves the chicken wraps(she doesn't eat red meat). The burgers are amazing! Great food and super friendly staff. Cash only(would eat here more if they accepted credit)."}
{"text":"Fave burger place in the west end. They make their own burgers and fries. So many toppings that I usually get the Old School which doesn't even have a patty and I don't miss it! Get the goo goo sauce to dip your fries in (mayo base)."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Magoo's for over 10 years and have never been disappointed. Magoo sauce is the best addition to any burger. Chicken burger is by far my favourite item on the menu and my go to! Chocolate milkshake is also delicious."}
{"text":"Overrated beyond belief. The burgers aren't anything special. I've tried them various times, and always the same - bland. They don't accept debit card. Big sign explains no debit \"for faster service\" which is a load of baloney. Order, sit, and wait for your burger to be prepared. There is LOTS of time to accept debit card.

Five Guys does a better burger & fried than this place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best under $5 burger in town.  It was the first place we wanted to get a bite after the typical 'home isolation' that happens for first-time parents.

Go for the magoo sauce (some sort of garlic mayo) on both sides of the bun and build your own burgers with the fresh toppings.  My wife swears by the chicken breast burgers.

Fries are fresh cut and just outta this world."}
{"text":"I dont know why I keep looking around for burger joints. How does that saying go again? Oh ya. Dont fix whats not broken. There is nothing for me to say that is bad about this place. Last time I went in there with my two kids, I ordered one big burger two small burgers and three fries. The nice lady tells me thats too much fries. Okay then, two fries (pretending that im not as fat as i really am). I know very well that the kids leave leftovers. Anyway the service is always great. And even entertaining to watch how well they keep up with their bursts of multiple customers. Every one leaves there satisfied. I recomend this place to everyone. Get bacon and mushrooms on your burger:)
And if your fat like me you will get two."}
{"text":"Solid neighbourhood burger joint. Fries are good, rings are good, burgers are really good. I get a side of chili (small one is like a buck) and drop it on my burger - awesome. Been going there about once a month forever. Magoo's and Magic Spot are the two great places for burgers in the Royal York/Bloor neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Not much to look at, food is GREAT!
I'm pretty sure this place still has the original decor as when it first opened. You will encounter the ice cream cooler first - tempting to skip the burgers & leave with dessert instead!!
Forge ahead a few steps to the \"Place your order here\" sign and go for it. Burger - 4oz is plenty - cheese & mushrooms for certain. Fries - hand cut daily - with Magoo Sauce, please!
Staff seem friendly & very focussed. No time for small talk. If I read this right, Magoos looks to be family owned & operated. 
After a brief wait, I get called to dress my burger - choosing from a large assortment of interesting toppings, I get my freshly cooked burger and fries on my blue, plastic tray and head to a bright, yellow table by the window. Retro - for sure!

Fries are awesome! Burger is tasty!
Too much for me to finish."}
{"text":"Went here last night and really enjoyed it! I agree with the other reviewers that the place itself doesn't look fancy but it delivers on the food. 

The burgers are grilled right in front of you and they have a wide array of toppings. Unlike other burger/sandwich places, they don't charge extra for guac (which to me was a definite plus!). I thought the spicy fries and poutine (my husband and I each ordered one) were just ok - as someone mentioned earlier, they make them well before the burger is done so by the time you are eating, they are no longer really hot/fresh. The meat for the burger was juicy and fresh. 

The staff are really friendly and nice to talk to and there is a comfortable vibe, like those neighbourhoods in the movies where everyone knows each other. 

Just FYI - they only take cash. There is however a TD bank a couple of doors down."}
{"text":"This place is simply worth the drive if you like to eat real quality burgers. Ordered the 6 oz burger :). I will be back again and again . Come on down ladies n gentleman.   Have a good eve"}
{"text":"Came to this location by coincidence as the place we went to try didn't have any seating. Quite a busy place during lunch. 

Looked at their menu and i tried their vege burger with spicy fries. The burger was decent looked like a regular burger and tasted quite good but their fries weren't spicy. The fries were seasoned and then fried. Over decent joint if you want to have a burger."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome burgers, in-store made patties and a great ice cream selection. This is an Etobicoke institution that pays homage to your mom and dad's burgers and milkshake joints of the 50s and 60s. It's been doing a brisk business for decades and will likely continue, thanks in a large part to loyal locals. Now that burger cuisine has gone trendy and competitive, Magoos offering does look a bit tired next to many of the Uber burger chains such as a Priest and even 5 Guys.

Get a Mac gourmet and don't forget lots of googoo sauce (housemade garlicky mayo) and bruchetta tomatoes on your burg. Milkshakes are top notch and rings are crisp with an old school batter style. Fries are a liability here, limp and underseasoned. But hey maybe I'm missing something as they haven't changed a bit in over 25 years. 

I always think you should take place for what it is, and this old style buyer diner is the one and only Magoos. People love it, it's consistent and it's miles ahead of any fast food chain.

Most of the people working here are literally family and they'll treat you that way too!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Solid fries. What makes this place unique is the toppings. Not many offer sprouts in the first place, nor do many places not charge extra for things like guac and bruschetta, let alone have it as an option. I also prefer that they use grated cheese and not a slice. Makes the cheese melt in a much cooler way. As for the whole licks wannabe stuff, that's just ridiculous. Magoos has been around for a long time. It has a relatively oldschool diner template, not sure why Licks is the poster boy for this."}
{"text":"Awesome classic burger shop.  Ordered the 6oz burger with chilli fries and they were fantastic.  The orders are prepared fresh right in front of you.  

This place has some of the best unique toppings to add to your burger including a house Magoos sauce and bruschetta.  

Only complaint is that they only serve Pepsi products for drinks."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal. First time going here with a couple of buddies from work. Decent burger, crispy fries that were well seasoned. Orange Crush on fountain which is amazing.

You can tell the place hasn't changed in a long time. It's got the feeling of an old neighbourhood diner with simple decor and photos of various little league teams on the wall. One of my buddies pointed out his own photo and spoke about how Magoo's used to give them ice cream after every game and then the kids and parents would come back to Magoo's for dinner. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"It's the best burger for the buck in the neighbourhood... 

The staff are friendly and efficient. The place is clean, but a little noisy. 

the burgers are OK, but nothing to write home about. The sign says that they are made fresh daily.  The food is a lot better than the fast food chains."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Magoo's many years ago when I worked nearby. It was always a reasonably good burger lunch at a decent price.

Returning the other night after almost 20 years, I was a little surprised to see that the interior hasn't changed a single bit! Now normally, I'd say that's a good thing, but man... this place is outdated and feels dirty.

I'm not usually one to complain about price, particularly when purchasing something \"gourmet\", but I was truly off-put by my $15 6oz burger combo, to which I DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION of upgrading to spicy fries. Not even for an additional fee. (I could have ordered the burger, fries and drink separately but then that upgrade would have been a few extra dollars). I mean, come on! Do spicy fries come from more expensive potatoes?

Secondly, my 4 year old decided she wanted a burger after all once we were already seated. I ordered her a 4oz burger with cheese. 8 dollars! For a baby burger? When asked to finish the burger with my (her) choice of toppings, I saw the unfriendly server add a small spoonful of cold shredded cheese to the bun by default. She explained to me that's how they do their cheeseburgers. WTF? I asked if it could be melted over the patty. She said \"The patty will melt it on the bun\". I said \"It had better because my kid won't eat it otherwise\". She scowled.

After my kiddo had a couple bites, she described her cheese as crunchy. I enjoyed eating the remainder of her $8 baby burger.

Adieu Mr. Magoo, It's \"hard to see\" why you're so popular. I'm blind to your business from herein."}
{"text":"AWSOME food !
Family run forever.
They are cash only.
Burgers & chilli are home made & always fresh ! 
Price is excellent"}
{"text":"I've tried many of the new \"Gourmet\" burger places in TO but I keep coming back to Magoo's time and time again.  Tasty burgers, fresh buns and condiments and fantastic fries.

The Staff is excellent......always friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Fresh made burgers. Great food. Build your own burger. Great choice of toppings. Including back bacon. Milk shakes. ATM machine. Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Magoo's is a classic burger joint that makes you feel at home. I love places that call your name when your order is ready. The burgers are made of fresh, lean beef and is probably the only place where you won't feel gross after consuming a gigantic burger. The fries are also made perfectly and taste homemade. 

There are many ways to customize your burger at Magoo's. They even have a \"special\" burger sauce as well as bruschetta toppings. I'd love to go back and try different combos at Magoo's!"}
{"text":"Burgers were really good. Tastes like a BBQ at your uncle Tony's when your were nothing but a little one. The decor sets a welcoming feel, due to not being way over the top. Burger places, please remember you serve burgers, not 5 course meals. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Magoo's knows how to do a good burger. Cooked to perfection every time and topped any way you like. I love their sesame seed bun and the alfalfa sprout option for a topping. Do yourself a favour and get Magoo's sauce on your burger and on the side with you fries. This little gem is great for a quick and inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Always excellent food here and relatively fast service. It's a step up from fast food so a longer wait is expected but they manage to have everything cooked fairly quickly even when busy.
The regular fries are mediocre but upgrade to spicy fries and you've got the best things ever."}
{"text":"Best Band Ever?  Best Movie Ever?  Best Burger Ever? All questions that can't ever be answered to everyone's satisfaction but by god, we'll all argue our opinion until we're blue in the face.

That being said...if you ever happen to get into it with me over the burger issue, it may be worth studying up on what I'm about to say.

Magoo's makes the BEST BURGER EVER.  

And to not leave it alone of my personal pedestal of awesomeness, I must also note that their hot dogs, onion rings and fries aren't too damn shabby either.  

They also have salad.  I have no opinion on their salads.  I've seen people order them but I question the wisdom of anyone who comes to a burger joint steeped in barbeque-y goodness and just orders a salad (not even a veggie dog or burger?).  I think they must be robots.  Skinny, health-conscious, will of steel robots.

They have 3 different sizes of patty you can order (along with chicken and veggie options) and a bunch of different \"garnishes\" you can add (bacon, cheese, mushrooms, etc.)  Once you've pondered and submitted your order to the extremely friendly staff (it's family run), you can sit in any of the booths or at any table and they'll call your name when it's ready.  Then you can go up and specify your toppings - sauces first (the usual plus honey mustard or Magoo sauce) and then the rest (lots of options and 3 different cheeses to choose from).  And the buns? Well they're a simple thing but easy to mess up and whichever type Magoo's uses, they hit it out of the starch park.  Seriously amazing...almost better than the burger itself.

And if you want dessert - they have a fair sized selection of ice cream flavours to enjoy.

Eating in or taking out is always the kicker question.  The nostalgia factor is high with the music channeling the bygone bobby-sox era, and the place (especially on summer weeknights and weekends) jammed with families.  So if you're in a social mood...take a seat and people watch.  But if you're hating humanity while craving burger goodness, I'd suggest taking the treats to go.

And if you do decide to swing by...whether because you are convinced by my argument or because you want to gather evidence to dispute it...note that they only take CASH."}
{"text":"average burger joint. definitely over priced, beef quality is lacking and the wait is horrendous"}
{"text":"Staple in the area.Got the 4 Oz.  Burger bacon and Cheese fries with gravey.  Get the Magoo sauce lots of other toppings.
Staff friendly I use a cane so they will bring order to my table  even if they're  busy. 
Never been disappointed, try the special  burgers"}
{"text":"Good price, and good music. Tasty and filling Burgers and the Magoo sauce and fries! 

Conveniently located, and good people."}
{"text":"Firstly, the service was great.  Really nice people.  Check. 
The decor, typical for a family run restaurant.  Clean.  Efficient.  Check. 
But I guess there are two camps on the burger front.  People that like dry meat patties layered with ketchup, mustard and mayo to make up for the dry meat and those that like juicy oozing with goodness patties that could be eaten without any condiments.  This place fell on the dry side.  And I'm not part of that camp.  For one, they say they make their patties fresh daily.  That's great, and maybe they do but they taste like pre-frozen and processed through an assembly line.  Maybe it's the type of chuck they use (too lean), or maybe they use a machine to form the patties and let it sit for hours.  Don't know.  Surely, cooking it on a grill instead of a flat top will dry it out.  All things that add to a burger with a texture that feels pre-frozen and processed no better then the frozen foods section at Costco.  Bun was nothing special.  Toppings seemed fresh though.

Based on a previous reviewer, I ordered the spicy fries.   But again, there seems to be two camps pertaining to fries too.  Those that like the crunchy, battered with something fries that you see at many fast food joints these days.  And those that like good spuds, not coated with batter to increase it's crispness or taste.  Simple, freshly cut, deep fried in lard and heavy on the salt.  I am part of that 2nd camp as well.  These \"spicy fries\" taste like they came from a McCain package sprinkled with mystery spicy salt.  Let down. I'll leave this place to the other camps to enjoy."}
{"text":"Of all the burger options around, this is a winner. Grilled to order 4 oz or 6 oz patties, with tons of add-ons like South Street. The assortment of burger toppings is also great, including 3 types of cheese and sautéed mushrooms. 

And milk shakes done the old fashioned way, from any flavour of ice cream in the cabinet!

Overall, this is a great burger and one of the better choices for good food in the area. I place them above South Street and just below Burgers Priest. You be the judge!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and son were craving a great hamburger and we looked to yelp for something close by.  Yelp lead us to magoo's gourmet burger.  We had high hopes and to make a long story short our hopes were smashed to pieces.  If we were to critique the food alone it was just ok.  Nothing special 2 or 3 star at best.  What turned the experience into a downright never come here again was the rude owner.  He clearly does not understand customer service and clearly is more concerned about making money.  My son had never tried a specific condiment and asked for it on the side which the girls at the counter was so kind to oblige only to get reprimanded that they should not have used a small plastic container and should charge the customer extra for asking for something on the side.  We were given our burgers in a paper bag to go even though we were clearly eating at the restaurant.  The owner then came and asked for his paper bag back obviously to reuse again.  We would not recommend this establishment to anyone who values delicious burgers with friendly service."}
{"text":"Similar to Lick's, decent meal and well priced. They charge extra for everything. Other than that, can't complain. The Magoo sauce is pretty good, but you gotta pay extra, and the spicy fries weren't spicy at all."}
{"text":"Took my staff over to Magoo's Burgers yesterday as it's the local burger spot nearest my office.  The orders ran the gamut from the Get Back (back bacon on a bun) to the 'fingers (gotta live those chicken digits) to the traditional Magoo burgers to the Veggie burgers.   Combo's ran between $8-11 bucks each.   

Magoo's is still noisy as hell so we just turned up our own volume as my crew chowed down.  The staff here are super friendly and know us all by first name.  There is still a decent selection of toppings (sprouts, bruschetta, Magoo sauce etc.) and the prep counter continues to be pristeen.  

Magoo's remains as one of my most fav burger spots.  It's a family own and run business and they care about the food that passes over their counter."}
{"text":"Attentive staff.
Excellent burger and fresh cut fries.
Decor is ugly, worst thing u can say. Little modernization be beneficial."}
{"text":"ARMANDO, come and get your burger. 

This place comes courtesy of my friend with the broken taste buds, he actually got another one right. haha.

Now for one I am not really a burger guy, just b/c I find that most burgers are really dried up and have no taste. I just find myself stacking on ingredients and condiments just to make the burger have some flavour. However this was the one place where if you were to get the burger alone with nothing on it, not even bread, its just that damn good.

Everytime I head to this place the same guy is always serving me. He's an older gentleman who is fit! I'm not talking about skinny fit I'm talking pure muscle fit. He looks like he was a body builder at one point and he could probably snap me like a twig if he really wanted to. However the moment you talk to him he is really friendly and likes to joke around too. So you could say hes a friendly giant!

So after you place your order they ask for you're name, so that they can call you when your burger is ready. For me I like to mix it up to see if the chef's can actually pronounce the name that I picked for that day, hence the reason for the opening line \"ARMANDO come and get your burger.\" They had trouble pronouncing that name. haha 

Anywayz back to the food the burgers are huge, very tasty, and are made to order. They come in either 4oz or a 6oz. and then there's the toppings. If you were to only get one thing on your burger I would recommend the Magoo sauce, one of the guys told me what it was but I forgot but it is that damn good. I usually get the Magoo sauce on the side to use as a dip for my fries. The fries that they have at Magoo's is good too, it reminds me of Swiss-Chalet fries. The only two other items I've had there was the chicken burger but it didn't really appeal to me, my suggestion is to stick to the red meat. As well I've had the chicken fingers and its basically the standard chicken fingers you can get anywhere else.

Now the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is b/c I don't justify spending close to $10 on a burger and almost $15 for a complete meal. I rather spend that much on buffet and eat my heart out on all the different types of food.

Items to definetly get

- either the 4oz or 6oz burger depending how hungry you are
- french fries
- Magoo sauce"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood burger shop. Try the different toppings for something new."}
{"text":"Real classic burger joint look and feel to the place.
However, they go with made fresh daily patties which in nice.
Got the gourmet burger and fries and cannot find anything to complain about.
Burger was fresh, juicy and well seasoned.  Topping were also all fresh and plenty to choose from.  Fries were not amazing, but they were real good.
Staff was awesome and and the price was great for what I got."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.

The decor and style is reminiscent of what Lick's used to be, but Magoo's has stayed true to themselves and still make everything fresh and tasty to order. 

I go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"So, I ordered a 4 oz burger, small onion rings and a small Pepsi (they don't have Coke). Total cost $9.04. This better be worth it.

Well, it wasn't bad. The place is nice and clean and the staff are pretty good.

Now, to the food. The burger was pretty good, toppings were fresh but the bun was a little stale. The rings were good and the drink ... well they had Pepsi, next time i'm bringing my own Coke.

'Nuf said"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but why has no one since the first review mentioned that this place is pretty much a Lick's?  

I mean, that's not a bad thing.  The burger I got was nice and juicy, the fries were ok, and the toppings were fresh.  But, God, everything about the place screams \"Not really Licks, but thanks for noticing!\"  

It's possible that's just a local hamburger place aesthetic that Toronto has, although I do recall Apache Burger being different, but I felt like I could peel back the sign on the front there would be a Lick's logo staring back at me. 

Once again, not the worst thing a place could do.  Lick's has blown up for a reason.  

I also get the strange sensation they wanted to call it Wimpy's, but forgot.  \"Who's that guy?  Hangs around with Popeye?  Eats burgers?\" \"Mr. Magoo?\"  \"Sounds right.\"

But, for all the love and accusations (false, shurely!) of being another place, Magoo's is a good restaurant, and a good place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever and friendly staff.  I love this place and indulge at least once a month.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Service was lacking, seemed very unfriendly when it was just a service counter operation. The extra $1 for cheese was just cold pre-shredded cheese which did not melt in the burger. Fries were delicious and had plenty of burger topping options. However, I would like to add that when asking what to put on your burger, it had us confused as some of the options offered was extra $$ on the menu, yet we had already paid initially."}
{"text":"A mom and pop burger and milkshake feel.  The quality of burger is great.  The staff and owners are always friendly.  This is our \"go-to\" whenever we are craving a burger."}
{"text":"I read a lot of positive reviews of this local burger joint. So I decided to come in for dinner and had a craving of a juicy burger with fries. So I noticed a combo deal on the wall called \" Sweet With The Heat\" signature burger  combo deal. The cashier informed that Magoo's use fresh not frozen patty's from Bruno's. I was impressed! She also added that the fries are freshly cut.
Anyway I waited for my meal with a bottle of water. In about 10 to 15 mins my meal was ready. I took a bite and all the juicy flavor of the meat, spicy red pepper jelly, Magoo's sauce, jalapeño, sweet honey, red onions and cream cheese overwhelmed my taste buds! My inner carnal cravings for a home-burger bug was satisfied. The fries were freshly cut to perfection and tasted really good. I have become a instant fan and will try other Magoo's burgers on their menu"}
{"text":"The burger was great and there was an interesting array of toppings (bruschetta, cucumber, sprouts).  The onion rings were okay, but nothing special.  There was a good selection of ice cream flavors as well.  My only complaint is that the service was kind of slow."}
{"text":"Ok burger place. The fact that there is not much around could make it a four but the burger really wasn't that great. I found the texture too slimy, and the taste pretty bland. The bun was cheap and fell apart. The fries were ok but nothing special. Service was pretty good. For the price, this place is a 6.5/10 for me."}
{"text":"Had zero expectations when I went to try them for the first time. The reviews for this place are either very positive or very negative. 

I got the 6oz burger with bacon & cheese. Also got fries & a small chocolate milkshake. Came to $20 inc tax. I thought that this was way too expensive for what I got but I guess those are the prices these days. The burger was dry. It was cooked well done.  Tasted like a frozen supermarket burger. Plus the bacon they use is back/peameal bacon & not the regular bacon. The place was packed on a Thu evening with families & regulars. I guess different strokes for different folks. 

I HATE giving such a low score to an independent burger joint close to my neighbourhood but I have to be honest. I like my burgers thick, juicy, greasy & done medium as I only crave a burger maybe once in 3 months. So I like to go all in. My top 3 are The Works, Slab Burger & Holy Chuck (Yonge & St. Clair)."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to a good burger. I like homemade melt in your mouth burgers.  Ive tried many places saying they made their burgers and food fresh but it either didn't taste like it or didnt quite excite my taste buds. The moment the burger touched my taste buds I knew I loved this place.  Great burgers and excellent fries .would deffiently recommend this place to anyone I know:)& the pricing good:)"}
{"text":"I came here to try their burger and fries for the first time.  I was highly disappointment with this place. The food was absolutely horrible. I got a fountain coke which tasted like pure syurp. The burger bun was soggy and the burger was dry  and had no taste to it. I ordered spicy fries which were okay but not spicy at all. I wont be back"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 10+ years... Best burgers in Toronto without a doubt. Fast friendly service from great people who make amazing food."}
{"text":"Fast friendly Service with quality burgers. Clean and healthy I consider Magoos burgers to be the best in the area. They have two sizes of patties, a chicken burger and hotdogs. Excellent fresh fries
and onion rings. They offer ice cream and a good selection of drinks. For condiments they offer fun stuff like magoo sauce, bruschetta, and sprouts. 

Always friendly and busy but they are fast and can handle any rush thrown at them. Burgers are around $5 and fries are $3"}
{"text":"Old school place with nothing overly exciting ..it has good stuff don't be afraid of this place, I just wish it was home made onion rings :)"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a burger I automatically head to Magoo's as it's hands down the best place to get a great-tasting burger."}
{"text":"I love old school diners, burger joins and malt shops. This place has the vibe of all three put together... I dig, I dig. I came in here with a friend who has frequented Magoo's much of his life, and the lady behind the counter joyfully saluted him by name when we came in. Come on, this place is cayuuuute. 

I had their gourmet burger and an iced tea. The burger was juicy, made on a grill in front of me, and then I got to choose my toppings from a wide variety under the glass. Think Subway only cool. When next in this area, I will definitely return. Merci, Magoo!"}
{"text":"So this place is kind of an old school, family type burger joint. Think Lick's, but less commercialized and standardized. The decor looks straight out of the 80's which is fine with me. I'm not one for flashiness when it comes to burger spots. On paper this place should deliver but it just doesn't. Here's why:

They need to get their timing down better. Fries don't go into the frier until just before the burger is done. I'd rather be waiting for my fries so they are fresh. They sit in the box for far too long.

It also kind of sucks that there really is no good place to stand while you are waiting for your burger. 

The burger was decent. A little over done and dried out but the flavour was decent. 

So all in all this place gets two stars. If you're a burger joint, your burger and fries should be your strength. It should outshine most of the other things on the menu."}
