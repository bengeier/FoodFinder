{"text":"I thought this was a very good place if you're in the mood for pizza, salad, or sandwiches. Pizzas are all 10\", server stated \"thin crust\" however I would say more original/pan crust.   Wings were just okay, nothing to write home about. Great salad, small size is definitely big enough for a meal or to split with someone + a pizza.   Will be returning when in the area for a fresh pizza and salad"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is AMAZING! The drinks, pizzas, and appetizers tasted great. Service was friendly and quick. The atmosphere and style of the restaurant was well designed and very comfy. Great happy hour specials too. Definitely worth eating there!"}
{"text":"Saw some reviews on yelp and since we live around the area figured we would give it a try.  Driving there you have to make sure you pay close attention or you might miss the turn. It's the first right turn after the Willetta light. Walked in and my husband and I were greeted quickly. Sat close to the wall of art. He liked that they had the football game on lol I ordered the Mac and cheese and the testosteroni pizza; he got the wings and the hottie pizza. The waiter was very friendly and let us know about a promotion they were having. Loved the food and environment! My husband said he thought his food wasn't hot enough, but he's really picky about his spices so wasn't surprised he said that lol he's harder to please I suppose but he said he liked it so we plan on going back :-)"}
{"text":"A favorite place to dine and have cocktails.  They will prepare food the way that i ask; they will make blue cheese stuffed olives for my martinis; and the staff are friendly, professional and informed.  Keep up the great work PPP!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on a Sunday afternoon on a whim and, I'm really glad I did!  The dining areas were very clean, open and inviting, in a way that creates an atmosphere where friends & families can enjoy each other's company or, watch a ball game in one of the big screen TV's behind the bar.  I was there on a father/daughter date.  I ordered the Seoul Fire Pizza and, my daughter ordered the The Hottie Pizza.  Both pizzas were outstanding!  I don't know who is responsible for the dough but, when baked into what can only be described as perfection, they were devoured with relish!  They have a very nice selection of beers on tap or, bottled if you prefer.  An A+ to the staff. The wait staff was very friendly & attentive without being intrusive.  The prices are very reasonably for the budget minded and, for the location, you could easily expect to pay much more. There is parking just to the right of the establishment or, even more convenient there is a light rail stop in front too.  Yes, I will be a return customer."}
{"text":"So I was in Phoenix for work and needed a place for dinner.  Let me say that while traveling for work, I take my meals very seriously.  If I'm going to have to eat out--alone, staring at the wall and unwittingly eavesdropping on people---then the food better be good.  And in this case it definitely was!!! I ordered the Vaquero \"burger\" but the allow you to select braided shredded chicken.  It was delish!  The bun and their house made apple slaw were excellent.  And, it had crispy onion strings that were great (I've had pathetic ones in the past).   Also important--the service couldn't have been better.  The host let me pick my seat (I thought that was against hostessng law?) and the server was very friendly. I really liked the dim lighting and differentiated seating."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! Go on Tuesday! Love the gluten free pizza crust, and  every other thing we ate! ZERO COMPLAINTS - ONLY PRAISES...and I'm an Italian foodie to the max!"}
{"text":"best. Burgers. EVER. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! They closed down for a little bit recently, but they are back. Same great menu, same amazing burgers, same really good pizzas. The service is good, and it has a really cool ambience. I don't think a lot of people know that this place is here, but I sure hope it gets discovered in a big way. I usually order a burger with cheddar, mushrooms and prosciutto, which is just damn tasty. Their fresh fruit bowl side is very good as well, and even has dates in it. Now you know where you can go to get a good date any night of the week :-) i'm so glad I can count Pizza People Pub among my favorite restaurants in Phoenix once again!"}
{"text":"Yikes! This team was really unprepared for the volume that was in Phoenix this weekend. Sunday for lunch there were more open tables than full and they were putting everyone on a 20 minute wait. Watched 26 people walk out in the 15 minutes I wanted and then I walked out. Dirty tables sat empty the whole time. I've ate food here before and it was decent and service is very average at best (bar service is always good). Hopefully they get their operations improved a bit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink! We got beers, cocktails and the garlic monkey bread. For 4.95 I didn't expect much but we would come back here for the monkey bread alone! Great service and cool ambiance. I loved the local art that was featured. I'll be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Really good selection of pizza here. I've tried a few and haven't been disappointed yet. I'd also recommend the truffle mac and cheese.   Nice, trendy (almost hipster) atmosphere and it really gives it a cool vibe."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such great food and atmosphere. The server was so nice recommending her favorites and even bringing us a sample. You can not go wrong with any of the Mac and Cheese options - all so incredible! Pizza was really great too. So much delicious food! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week.  At work we try new spots to eat as a group once a month and someone suggested this place.  I had no idea this existed in Phoenix.    I really like this restaurant for lunch.  I loved the art from local artists on the wall.  Location is a little hidden, but not hard to find.  I ordered a my burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce without the bun) and it was so good!  Probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  I was not a fan of their Cole slaw, but the protein burger was delicious.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal.  The name is a tongue twister, but the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Pizza People Pub on Saturday night to try a new, nearby restaurant and to enjoy some pizzas. We totally loved it there.  The atmosphere is cool and chill, the music selection was enjoyable but not overwhelming, and the service was outstanding. Along with that, the food was excellent. The crust on the pizzas came out thin and crisp, and my husband's mac and cheese pizza blew him away.  We also loved trying many of the craft cocktails on the menu, and didn't find one we didn't like.  We'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"A delicious, creative place-based right on the light rail in central Phoenix - I have been here 3 times this year, & every time I have had a great experience. The staff is friendly and helpful, the appetizers are delicious, they have all kinds of ideas of what you can do with a pizza, & the atmosphere & seating is wonderful both indoors & outdoors (comfiest leather chairs you've ever sat in)!"}
{"text":"Pizza People is a win-win situation for those with dietary restrictions who dine with those who are not limited :) I can have the gluten free pizza with vegan cheese. I can also have several salads with dressings that fit my health program. Everything is always delicious. My friends and husband can have the regular pizza and everyone is happy!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend and loved the place! Great atmosphere, friendly service, and on top of that delicious food! We got The Real Caesar salad and Popeye pizza. The pizza's crust was crispy but soft on the inside and the fresh basil in the pizza was so good! We will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Stopped by Pizza People Pub on a Friday night for some food and beer.  The place was packed and loud with a dj spinning tunes right near the entrance.  The wait was a little on the long side (they said 30 minutes but I think it was longer) and I did notice a number of people walk away once they found out how long the wait was.  There are a number of couches and chairs to lounge around in near the entrance and outside so with a couple beers in our hands the wait became a non-issue.  The wings were probably some of the best I've had with a lot of substance and a nice buffalo sauce with some added pepper kick.  The pizza was also quite delicious although not necessarily my favorite.  Prices were alright although the pizza's were a little on the small side I thought.  Staff was very friendly throughout the night.  Ultimately, pizza people is a great place to gather, drink, and eat good food.  If I am truly craving pizza I might prefer a more traditional american/italian style place but pizza people's atmosphere and other menu alternatives definitely serves another niche on my food craving spectrum."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, great pizza, good prices, friendly staff. Free wi-fi. I had the Popeye, best spinach pizza in the Valley. Great for lunch."}
{"text":"Update: definitely overpriced. $6 for a draft beer (this location doesn't merit that kind of price nor did the beer). Food is forgettable."}
{"text":"Well I went around 5pm on a weekday. There was only one table seated an eating. 10 minutes after being seated I still didnt get a waiter. For lack of service I wont go back."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but quality food. One of my favorite places to go for vegan pizzas."}
{"text":"Heads up, this review is about cheese. Ooey-gooey cheese. Like in the commercials where you pick up a slice and the strings trail down almost like the rest of the pizza doesn't want to let part of it go. That image of cheesiness is what we took home with us after trying out a few of the pies at Pizza People Pub. We don't mean that in a good way. Some people may love extra cheese on a pizza, but the cheese-to-sauce ratio is sacrosanct to our ideal pizza. It should be a matrimony of the two factors, not a bloody Battle of Fredericksburg where the cheese is the confederacy, the sauce is the union, and the crust looks on as a disappointed Abraham Lincoln. Yes this is going to be hyperbolic.  Really, this pizza wasn't exactly bad, but merely average. It has a lot of unrealized potential.   Usually we like to discuss each element of the pizza individually, but we can't say anything about the sauce mostly because we don't know what it tasted like. Maybe some oregano pockets, a little sweetness at times. Really all we could taste was cheese. The sauce was probably a lighter tasting sauce anyway, but there was so little of it. We guess that was a necessary choice because a normal amount of sauce would have given the crust the impossible task of holding it all up. Speaking of crust, it wasn't bad. Decent flavor, chewy and a little crispy, with mostly appropriate caramelization around the rim and bottom. It was actually our favorite part of the pizza, but we think that's because its lack of cheese was a welcome respite.   The question on your mind, we know, is \"Did this pizza form the dreaded cheese blanket?\" The answer is no, not quite. Maybe a cheese bedsheet. It was definitely the dominating flavor, along with the almost excessive oiliness it brought to every bite. When you have too much cheese it just doesn't brown appropriately, and that was evident here. Worse, unless you ate the whole pizza very quickly, the cheese cooled off to form a semi-shell. This was the first pizza on this blog where we can definitely say there was too much cheese, period. It's not enough for us to say this pizza was bad, but it was enough to feel regret after having put all of it into our stomachs.   We tried the pepperoni and \"The Hulk\" which featured a pesto sauce with arugula, spinach, and red peppers. The pepperoni fell victim to the cheese overload, while the pesto pizza was slightly better. That might just be because we love arugula on pizza. We can tell you we really couldn't notice the difference between the two sauces because there was so little there. We didn't love either of them, but the pesto one was the more enjoyable.   We're sure there are places that put even more cheese on their pizzas, but this is kind of the amount of cheese where we start to draw a line in the sauce. We value a balanced cheese-to-sauce ratio and we don't think Pizza People Pub does. The rest of the menu featured several different kinds of Macaroni and Cheese, so maybe cheese is their deal. These people are serious about their cheese and if you are too, this might be the place for you. And that's fine. But in our ideals of what pizza should be, we have trouble rating this any higher than a flat mediocre. Instead of a lovely three part harmony, this pizza is a forte melody of cheese-cheese-cheese. Oh, we will say the chairs were comfy as hell. Shout out to whoever picked out the chairs."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheeses are fantastic.  The pizza and wings are pretty good.  The service is bad."}
{"text":"How hard is it to make a decent BLT? I was in a hurry and not overly hungry so I bypassed the pizzas and other specialities, ordering a blt with extra tomatoes and light mayo. This was too hard for the kitchen apparently. The bacon was more like jerky and not freshly cooked, leftover from breakfast? The tomatoes consisted of four thin slices on each half, each about the size of a quarter. This despite charging $1.25 for extra tomatoes on top of the 12.50 sandwich. There was no mayo, had to drench the cold dry hala bread.  The side salad was good and the wait staff nice.  Ok atmosphere, but the chair was so lacking in seat cushion I felt like my chin was resting on the table.  One hopes the rest of their menu items are better, I could have as easily eaten the menu itself...with ketchup."}
{"text":"We went out to try places we hadn't been before and enjoyed this place so much we ended up there twice in an afternoon, evening and night exploring downtown.  On the first visit, we had the jalapeño canoes (so good!).  They were served on a piping hot plate and were fresh and very tasty. The mac n cheese was delicious.  Just as excellent as the food was the service.  Our waiter (Rami) was very helpful, efficient and best of all fun.  Really welcoming atmosphere with local artists work on the wall and football games on the TVs. After checking out several other places over the course of our outing, we decided to circle back and end our night there.  We tried some sandwiches - the BLT and the Vaquero burger - both outstanding, but I highly recommend the Vaquero burger!  The spud fingers are delicious too.  The food is great, but we all know how great service can really make the difference and this place has it.  Our waiter in the evening (Drew) was just as welcoming, helpful and fun!  You gotta check out this place!"}
{"text":"Cool interior, food was served fast, very pleasant server, and pizza was delicious :)"}
{"text":"I placed an order to go. The food was fine. The waiter was not impressive though. He started out very nice, until I paid cash and when he asked, \"do you need change?\" I said, \"yes, please.\" The change he should've brought me $3.15. Instead, he brought back $3 and shoved the tray in front of me and quickly walked away. I'm all for tipping and I am an excellent tipper when I get good service. I felt his attitude was entitled and his effort was minimal. His change in behavior was unpleasant and rude. I would've left a tip, but since he took it upon himself to tip himself a measly $0.15, I left it at that."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  The food is great, which is a must if you want to get 3-4 stars.  The atmosphere and location easily gets this restaurant to 5 stars. HIGHLY recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for our second time last night and the food and waitress are amazing. After a ruined night at a comedy club the waitress turned our whole night around. She was bubbly, funny, and great service.   The pizza was outstanding! They even split two flavors since I could not decide which one I wanted without batting an eye. \"The Hottie\" was outstanding, nice burn with the peppers but a cool down with the cheese and perfect crust. The \"Date Me\" was a sweet date goodness paired with the porchetta was good. Even the \"PBPBJ\" which is backed pizza dough and peanut butter and jelly with apples was out of this world good.   Great job on your food, service and giving back to the environment."}
{"text":"Yummy jerk chicken pizza! Good times and great food. Love coming here after church on Sundays!"}
{"text":"It's hard to choose between the many pizza places in the Phoenix area, but you won't go wrong with this one. Just look at their menu! There are tons of different varieties of food that you can choose from. Also the prices are excellent and there are very few things over 10$.  This gives you the opportunity to have a 3 course dinner for dirt cheap.  I have been here a few times and I am happy to see it become so popular. They are open for brunch and offer a great selection of food to fit a day after drinking late in the night.  The ooonly complaint I have is the music is a bit dated. It isn't worth taking a star off. You know those 50's diners that play oldies music? I felt like the PPP was attempting to emulate that environment but with 80s and 90s music..."}
{"text":"Went here for quick lunch while exploring Phoenix. Loved the date me pizza and wings were great too!!"}
{"text":"The new owners Michael and Lauren really know what they are doing! Food and ambiance is amazing. Would highly recommend the manny pizza and mac and cheese! My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"The pesto hummus is amazing! Also love the Date Me pizza. Great atmosphere and music add to a fun, chill vibe. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just like Streisand sang, \"People. People who need Pizza People ... are the luckiest people in the world.\" Well, she should've sang it that way. Memories light the corners of my mind. Pizza, mac & cheese, sandwich and burger memories ... of Pizza People Pub.   If you cherish the memories of Mary Beth and Tim Scanlon with their Pizza People Food Truck, you probably know by now that they teamed up with Tom Jetland of Switch, FEZ and the founder of Ticoz to found their first brick 'n' mortar pizza pub. Yes, happy days are here again. Tom's culinarily creativity and restaurant savvy has never met a stoney end. They made a place where anywhere you hang your hat is home. The former Cheuvront's on Central is their home, but with a smart remodel it's no second hand rose. It's a \"happening\" near Hance Park, you might say.  Start off with the amazing Chicken Wings (ten for $10.95). You have nothing to be guilty of because they're baked, not breaded and fried. They're big, moist and luscious with crispy skin. Six different preparations are sweet inspiration for these babies.  The main event is certainly the twelve artisan pies (plus endless combinations of a pie you can build). Each arrive with a 10-inch crust made from house-made dough. The \"Testosteroni\" is more traditional with red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, ground beef, Italian sausage, onion and basil. How lucky can you get? Handsome Chef Matt Gooding is a regular Prince ... of Tides. And pizza.  Another chart topper is the \"Date Me\" with mozzarella, goat cheese, minced prosciutto, chopped Arizona dates, fresh arugula and agave vinaigrette drizzle. All pizzas are under $10, so the server won't rain on your parade when you get the check. Speaking of servers, oh my man, Roger, I love him so. Ask for Nicholas and you'll say, \"Well, hello, gorgeous!\"  Papa, can you hear me? Because the burgers and sandwiches are award winning. The Fairmount Fire burger is for those who like it hot and spicy. It comes with chiles, mozzarella, romaine and a Buffalo-like red hot sauce on a brioche bun for $9.95. Did we mention it's hot? I hope the Sloppy Seoul stays. It's a fresh take on the traditional \"Joe\" with Korean sweet & spicy barbeque topped with kim chee and romaine. Six other sandwiches or burgers make picking a winner difficult. Each come with a fresh, mild, crunchy agave apple cole slaw.   In a city battling it out for the best Mac & Cheese, I'd be surprised if Pizza People's didn't win the Oscar. You've got ten amazing, different varieties of the classic with creative twists in each one--mushrooms, paprika, truffle, bleu cheese and more. Add bacon, chicken, ground beef or Italian sausage for a trifle more. Mini Mac: $3.95 or Biggie Mac for $9.95. Spare me the guilt trip. I'm already nuts for it.  A full bar with creatively crafted cocktails is also available. Don't miss their Happy Hour from 3-6:30 p.m. daily. So on a clear day you can see forever. All the way to Pizza People Pub. No more hunger and thirst, but first be a person who needs Pizza People. That's what Barbra would sing, anyway. Who am I to argue?   Read more at ionaz.com"}
{"text":"Had a great selection of various pizzas. Service was good for the most part. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I wish it was closer and I would have a new weekly home-base pub. There is zero wrong here and 100% awright awright awright. Daughter and I stopped in after being downtown for the day and shared buffalo wings, Mac with corn, and a Manny 10\" pie. Food was literally perfect and my 21 year-old was digging the vibe."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese can be awesome and it can be made like they do here.  Pizza People Pub's recipe reminded me of Velveeta Shells and Cheese that my roommates used to make from the box when I was in college (ick). I coulda prepared this at home out of the box for a buck fifty rather than 10 bucks here. Our server noticed we hadn't eaten any after the 1st bite and asked if there was a problem. We told him we didn't like it and why. He gave a condescending look and a sigh, took it away and returned with the check. No offer of dessert menu, would you like another drink..  I will not return."}
{"text":"Group of us ate here before Coyotes game while visiting Phoenix for Spring Training.  Garlic Monkey bread was good addition with cold beer.  Everyone enjoyed their meals from pizza to the pub burger."}
{"text":"We were craving wings and I wanted to try a new place so we picked Pizza People since I heard about it from Chow Bella. The staff was friendly but the wings were not so good. It seemed like they were all cooked the same way then sauce was thrown on them, instead of being cooked with the sauce. And the sauce was so copius that it was everywhere and hard to eat. I couldn't believe I made it out without staining my clothes. I did like all the veggies that came with the wings, that was cool. I suppose we should have ordered pizza. Perhaps we will go back and give that a shot."}
{"text":"I love Pizza People's new restaurant.  I've been there several times now with the hubs and  friends.   lt has become a regular dinner spot for us.  The space is very comfortable and inviting.  I love the couches!  They make for a really cozy space to sit, talk and eat some pizza!  And the staff are so friendly and welcoming.    I highly recommend the Date Me pizza.  I never would have thought that dates on a pizza would be so delicious.  I got mine sans proscuitto (I'm vegetarian) but I can imagine the salty and sweet mix would be fabulous.  And I love that they have vegan and gluten free options for all of the pizzas on their menu!    If you haven't been here yet, you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I went in early in the afternoon, in the middle of their soft opening. I was greeted with a smile by the host and offered a seat at the bar since I came in alone. There wasn't much of a crowd, it was mid day  so I expected that there would be more people because of the lunch hour and the location. I was served a cold glass of water and given a menu by the friendly bartender.   For an app I ordered the Jamaican Jerk chicken wings and for a meal I asked for the Fun-Guy artisan pizza.   The wings had a nice kick to them and the ranch was tasty, a bit on the sweeter side though. The issue was that some of the wings had a chewy texture, as if the chicken was not fresh and had been refrigerated for quite some time.   The \"Fun-Guy\" pizza was underwhelming. Mozzarella, Crimini mushrooms, fresh Arugula and topped off with truffle oil. The Mozzarella cheese was bland, almost as if they opted to use some generic brand of cheese. I specifically ordered this pizza as I did not want the flavors to be overpowered by greasy meats. The Crimini mushrooms smelled great but their flavor seemed much stronger than that of the cheese. The Arugula felt like a strange choice as you cannot taste it. I was hoping that it would add a new and different texture but in the end, it was just some flat greens with no character. The Truffle oil only heightened the mushroom taste of the pizza, so if you really like mushroom flavor, I would highly recommend the \"Fun-Guy\".   On the other hand, the dough was soft and had a fantastic texture, by far my favorite part of the pizza.   I only gave it 3 stars but by no means is it a bad score, I do plan on returning and will try something different from the menu. Their wings weren't great and the pizza has a run of the mill flavor but the atmosphere was friendly and that is why I will return."}
{"text":"Had really great food here (date pizza, hummus, and Mac and cheese) and the atmosphere is cute and welcoming. Service was a tad slow when we first arrived but it was a busy Friday and our server was apologetic. Value was great-- fiancé and I left stuffed and we each had two drinks for a tab of around $50. For the quality we definitely would have expected higher prices. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. The pizzas and mac and cheese are nothing short of spectacular. Their sustainability is impressive as well. Easily one of the best restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizzzzza! I had a hard time deciding between a pizza or a salad, everything sounds so good. I got the Fun Guy on gluten free crust- super good. I definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Have been twice for lunch only. First visit had regular Mac and cheese. Second visit had regular Mac and cheese and this time got a little wild and added chicken. It was very good both times. It's super hot straight out of the oven and slightly crisp at the top. Delicious! I'll have to try something else, but can't resist having their Mac and cheese. Will have to try happy hour after work and see how it is to upgrade to five stars. Staff is friendly and the interior is clean and comfortable. It's located on Central Ave across from the main Library."}
{"text":"I have been underwhelmed with many of the new & hip downtown restaurants I have been told I \"must try\". This was not the case wit Pizza People Pub. Right out of the gate I was happy with how I was greeted and seated. For such a new restaurant the customer service was already in line.  The Honey Ginger Soy Wings were great. Meaty and cooked well with veggies and dipping sauce on the side. There were a bunch a good looking flavors and I will be back to try them.   There are a handful of Mac & Cheeses on the menu. I had the Bleu Cheese and it was really tasty, cheap, and plentiful.   For the pizza I tried their Hottie. Serrano, jalapeno, house made sausage, with some fresh chiffonade basil on top that really brightened it up. The crust was delicious and not greasy which I always like. It held up well to the toppings and wasn't a limp mess.  I loved loved loved the sausage. Fennel seeds in sausage always score points with me.  A lot of new artisan pizza places go for combinations that just seem like they watched to much Food Network when they were designing their pizzas. PPP got their toppings sorted out with their food truck and they serve up smart and delicious combinations. The chef clearly focused on flavor and did not tie the menu to traditional American or Italian pies.   I thought it was ballsy to go for this type of pizza place so close to Pizzeria Bianco but I think their well thought out and executed menu is going to surprise people in the area.   This isn't really a negative just an FYI...although the menu would leave you to believe there is a sports bar theme with lots of TV's for watching games...there are not. It is a comfy place with good music and a great place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"I love this new pizza joint.  Low key chill kinda pub, where you can enjoy watching Sunday football at the bar or just hanging out with a group of friends shooting darts. We had the Margrita and the Date Me. Both were rather delicious. I love that they are located right off the light rail station. I would probably want to come here after work for happy hour."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had hoped for more. Would have liked to see lunch specials - none. Wanted pizza, expected to be able to order a couple of slices ... nope have to order a whole 10\" pie.  Friendly staff, easy parking, decent ambiance, quiet and conveient location. Will likely come back, just will not be one of my 'go  toz; places."}
{"text":"The cocktail I ordered was perfect-o, while the Jamaican Jerk baked wings were sooooo flavorful. Their pizza/crust is some of THE best I've had.  The best part?!?!  Their prices!  Great food/atmosphere for the  buck!  Will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Marybeth allowed me to host a fundraiser for cancer research last week, and reserved an entire section for my gathering. Drew was the sole waiter for 21 people and did *amazing*. All who attended raved about the food, atmosphere, and service, and most promised to return...mostly so they can try all the flavor combinations of the ridiculously delicious macaroni and cheese!  I owe much gratitude to Marybeth, Drew, and all at Pizza People Pub for making certain my fundraiser event was successful and fun for all. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"Set across from the Burton Barr Library this place seems more like a bar with a street-side cafe attached, where the burgers and salads shine, but the namesake pizza falls short.  Me and my co-workers stopped in for lunch one day and were greeted by a friendly and enthusiastic staff.  The place was empty;  I mean we were one of only two parties there, but it was still only quarter of 12:00.  I ordered the Testosteroni pizza, a meat-lovers pizza, and in a city that has award winning pizzerias, this was just passable.   The approximately 9 inch thin crust was nicely cooked, however lacked any flavor.  The toppings, although ample, did not play nice together, and ended up leaving the palate in a state of confusion.  The sauce and cheese where just overpowered and almost seemed like a second thought.  Even the visual appeal of this pizza was off.   Each half looked liked it came from different pizzas (see pix).   This was definitely a \"pub\" pizza.  That being said, the burgers and salads that my co-workers ordered looked appealing, were made with fresh ingredients, and were enjoyed by all.  Overall I would be willing to return to try some of the other selections, but I will go elsewhere for pizza..."}
{"text":"I found this to be one of the best pizza's I have had in Arizona.The restaurant was very nice and clean and they had some great music playing which was nice.The staff was very friendly and professional. we met the owner MaryBeth she was extremely helpful and nice......she even made our drinks.......I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive and friendly!  The gluten free options round off the menu for those with wheat sensitivities.  And the non-smoking patio provides a fresh eating experience."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way...after our first time trying it, we went back 2 more times the same week!  The big leather wingback chairs, the couches, and the industrial chic atmosphere are all very welcoming. The pizza is delicious. My favorite is the Happy Mac -- hamburger, mac, onion and tomato on a pizza. Who does that?!  The Hottie --- it's good but it's really hot!  I also tried the Date Me. It's a little sweet, but a fun twist on pizza. And of course the classic, pepperoni, was just perfection. The head chef told us they put PBR in the crust instead of water, and that's what makes it so good. Slow clap for whoever's decision that was.  The mac & cheese (even the half portion) is huge! So gooey and cheesy. Smart choice to serve it in a metal cup so the inside/bottom never gets cold.  The jalapeno canoes are pretty good. The bacon on ours was a little burnt, but I'm hoping that was a fluke. This appetizer has potential.  Piggies in a blanket were yummy and they came with a side of nicely cut veggies.  Salads are hearty and fresh and well conceived. Only problem is trying to avoid the delicious fattening foods in favor of the healthy option!  Ranch is good, but beware it is a very dilly ranch.  My only regret is that they aren't operating their food truck anymore. They told us it was for sale and that bums me out since that's how they got their start. I'm happy they have become so successful, but I wish they could use the truck to take the pizza to the people. But I guess beggers can't be choosers. I'll take my PPP any way I can get it!"}
{"text":"Drink selection is great and fairly priced.   PIzza - Date Me Pizza was too greasy and I didn't care for the type of prosciutto - the fat overpowered all of the other toppings.  Pesto pizza was middle of the road.  Mac & Cheese - Jalapeno was excellent - would highly recommend.  Buffalo was too powerful but we also ordered a bleu cheese to mix in.  Together, they are a perfect combo.  Overall I'd come back for the drinks and mac & cheese.  I'll avoid the pizzas."}
{"text":"Jalapeno canoes: so hot. My teeth are sweating. Still crisp and bright and my hair is soaking wet from sweat. The Manny was also hot. And so delicious. What was I thinking. I love it."}
{"text":"Good place to have a drink and eat a slice - they have gluten free and drink specials which are awesome"}
{"text":"I had the wings - sweet and spicy Korean, and honey ginger soy.  The sauces were good but not as bold as I would have liked.  The flavors were mild overall.  My favorite of the two was the honey ginger soy.  The chicken was a little dry/tough at times like they'd been under a heat lamp.  My wife had a BYO pizza.  She enjoyed it but said it didn't really stand out in any way and was a little salty.  She loved the agave apple coleslaw!  The setting is comfortable and pleasant but with the music, a little loud for regular conversation.  The service was very good.  Overall I would come back but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"For a casual night out or some light comfort food, this is the place to go. The pizzas are great (Testosteroni and Date Me are great choices), appetizers are amazing (Jalapeno Canoes and Garlic Monkey Bread are my favorites) Macaroni selection (Blue Mac w/buffalo sauce) lip smacking good.  Salads and Desserts (half baked Cookie with Ice Cream) YUMMMMMMM!!!!! Definitely worth a cheat day from the gym. Service and the wait time are great and short. Be warned though,  you won't be going to pilates after this. Straight home to Netflix and chill. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Very nice trendy place! Great food and great service! Andrew was our waiter-he was Terrific! The Fire Burger and Jalapeno Canoes were BOMB!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight to try something new. We ordered 5 different pizzas and 3 starters and everything was on point and delicious. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Definitely trying the Mac and cheese. I had the Happy Mac pizza which had Mac and cheese with ground beef. Totally awesome! My favorite thing was the Drippy Fries it's a must try for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good Pizza expensive They were out of IPA draft and titos vodka and when I spoke to the manager about this  issue he basically walked away before I was finished speaking to him. Needless to say I was not pleased with his response - no offering of a free drink or happy hour meatballs- weak customer service."}
{"text":"First off, the service was really great. The food however, was very disappointing. I had seen a lot of good reviews so I figured it would be pretty good but everything was just too bland and flavorless. I had a margherita pizza. The dough had no flavor and was overcooked, the sauce was watery and flavorless and the cheese didn't have much flavor either. It was just really bland. Very disappointing. I don't know if it was just an off day or what but I would not go back here again."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with two friends and was impressed with the service. Our server was kind, personable, and was a great spokesperson for the menu. I don't think there was an item that she couldn't give a glowing review of!   The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. I had the margherita, but the mozzarella was virtually tasteless, so I had to load it up with parm and red pepper flakes. The bread was delicious, however. My two friends also thought the food was decent, but not impressive.  I live nearby, so I'm sure I'll be back, hopefully to better results!"}
{"text":"We decided on Pizza People Pub for a Friday work lunch to celebrate a co-worker's last day. We had a table of 7 people and the restaurant was not super crowded for lunchtime. We started off with the garlic monkey bread (free with Yelp check-in) and the jalapeño boats. Both were scrumptious! Great for sharing with a group as well.   PPP has great lunch specials and we all took advantage ordered some combo of pizza and salad.  I love that you can sub Daiya vegan mozzarella on any pizza. While I'm not vegan, I looove that cheese brand! Their signature pizzas are very unique and not just the traditional pepperoni, sausage, etc. I ordered the Sara, which boasts garlic butter, spinach, red onion, and avocado! Their house salad dressing is also very delicious.   The service was just so-so. Our server was fine but not spectacular. The restaurant does try to be \"zero waste\" by implementing a variety of recycling and other green method, which is something we can all get behind."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the decor, the staff and the FOOD.   $5 Tuesday is a great deal! This pizza was really good, the wings were delicious and the ranch dressing...don't get me started on that. Apparently it is house made and tastes nothing like ranch...so, so good. It has garlic and dill, wonderful!   I did not enjoy the hummus plate it may have been a little heavy on the tahini.  But hey, I can get hummus  a n y where, no biggie.   Can't wait to go try some of the other offerings.  My server was a tiny little thing with dreads. So cute, she was so accommodating when I wanted a lo-cal cocktail. No problem, I ordered the Huckleberry (something or other), modified it with no sprite and 1/2 the huck juice and voila...perfection!    Love love love...."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Amazing gourmet pizza at an inexpensive price. If you don't like pizza they have other great options. Their menus is vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free friendly but is by no means strictly a vegetarian environment. They have food for all, my favorite being the Happy Mac pizza. The service is ALWAYS friendly, accommodating and efficient. The restaurant's atmosphere is artistic and classy. Well worth the visit, it might become you're new favorite spot too."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great as well as the wide variety of items on the menu. What's really great is how nice and attentive the staff is. You can't go wrong here...from the food to the casual, relaxing atmosphere to the fantastic staff, it's one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"It's in my neighborhood! What's not to love about all the good stuff here? Pizza salad appetizers good bar atmosphere patio lite rail ... Try it you'll love it IMO"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! When the dr suggested i eliminate dairy from my diet for my son's sake my first thought was \"no more pizza!\" but they have vegan \"cheese\" (as well as gluten free crust) which is incredible! The drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"I have to say the hulk pizza is pretty good the crust was crispy but a little cold when came out the wings I did not like the Koren sauce was good but I think they bake there wings so they were mushy not crispy but they do come with veggies that makes it a little better  but it took about 35 min to vet my food witch sucks  now my server was horrible very rude I sat down he was in such a hurry took my drink order and ask for my order in the same sentence I've only been there like 5 min after I game him my order I didn't see him till he brought my food out the buy at the counter siting people refilled my drinks two times before I saw him then I ask for blue cheese instead of ranch I got ranch I ask for blue cheese I finished my food before he came back I might go back in the future I'll give it a second chance we will see"}
{"text":"We're SO thrilled that PPP has been resurrected under new ownership. While in many instances this might not always bode well for an eatery's future in this case I'm happy to report that things are just as good as you might remember. The space has been redistributed as far as the seating goes, but happily the menu and the phenomenal staff and atmosphere remain intact.  We've been coming to PPP for well over two years  ( I can't believe it's taken me so long to sing it's praises ) and there has never been a time that it's been anything but a pleasure to hang out here, indulge in their amazing Mac & Cheese selections combined with one of the delicious pizza choices. The new set-up has an expanded craft beef selection as well focusing on local brewers.   What has always made Pizza People Pub a staple of our dining choices has been the friendly and engaging staff. Daniel often works the bar as well as waiting tables and is just a phenomenal asset to the establishment.  Make a point to get to know him, along with all of the staff. Everyone is welcoming and makes you feel they're happy you came to spend time with them.   Pizza People Pub is one of those gems in the Downtown area you almost want to keep to yourself, but it is well worth your time to pay a visit to, frequent, and make your own. My friends and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Easily one of my top 2 or 3 (if not my top) destinations. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"My first time going to Pizza People, I was pretty underwhelmed and the service sucked. I usually try to go back to places twice to make sure - and I'm glad I did. It seems like my bad experience was an anomaly.  Going back, I found it's turned into my favorite, go to, for easy take-out food. I'm a huge fan of their sides! They have great Mac and Cheese, fries and other sides. The staff has been really great and their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not bad service! Really interesting pizza flavor combos and a good selection beer. Full bar and lots of screens for you sportos."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to the PPP. Loved the atmosphere, art & food. We tried the Leezies Sweet & Spicy Korean Wings, Testosteroni Pizza & last but not least the Peach Bread Pudding with vanilla ice cream. Every single thing I liked minus the sausage in every bite of the pizza but that's just personal preference & by no means a negative. Our visit was at 6 p.m. on a Sunday & the staff was quick at first but as tables rolled in it slowly dwindled. But in her defense she was working 6 tables or so. I highly recommend the wings as they were my fave & ask for extra sauce. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick work meeting.  Appetizers only.  Bruschetta was delicious and hummus was also very good.  Full menu looked really good...will definitely be back to give the broader selection of food a try."}
{"text":"I'm currently in a bleu cheese mac & cheese afterglow.  It's sinful, decadent, breathtaking.    The Parm/corn mac and cheese was amazing too, but taken to the next level with a few dashes of Cholula at home (we went the spoiled route and shelled out for a 3rd party delivery service).  The Testosteroni pizza is quite bold in flavor in its very evident the ingredients are fresh.    The clincher, the dill/garlic dipping sauce for the potatoes.  The combination of the fingerling potato wedges, seasoning and texture was delightful.  I'm looking forward to exploring their menu!! They're off the light rail and an affordable option when I don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Services blows!! Food was good when we finally got it. 20minutes for a drink at the bar. 1 bartender on duty on a Saturday night. If you have 3 hrs to burn for dining with drinks this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We come here once a week for dinner. My favorite pizza is the Hulk, and my husband loves the Hottie. Their pizza and beer is very good for the price, and the service is always fast and friendly. I've never experienced a wait to be seated here, and I've only ever gone on Saturdays.  The only little gripe I have is that I opted for the Build Your Own Pizza on my most recent visit, and added Parmesan to the pie for $1.45 extra, expecting shaved or shredded parmesan or something. Nope. As far as I can tell, I was charged $1.45 for the cook to shake powdered parmesan over it. The same parmesan they bring to your table for free. It was still good, but skip adding parmesan!"}
{"text":"Not a single complaint from us. We had the garlic monkey bread, paprika mac, and the testeroni pizza and everything was perfect. Our waiter, Jeramy,  was really friendly and attentive.   The garlic monkey bread was honestly one of the best garlic breads I've ever had! So crispy but still light and fluffy on the inside. The paprika mac was to die for, so creamy and tasty. And the pizza was perfectly done, really good combo of toppings.   We sat outside and it had the perfect ambiance. Dim lighting and minimal noise. Perfect way to enjoy the weather with your meal."}
{"text":"Writing this while still waiting for my food. For 30 minutes. For a sandwich and side salad. There are two other tables in here- one of which was so tired of waiting they asked for their food to go. Outside, two additional tables, all of whom were already seated when we arrived, and they just now got their food.  Slowest service I have experienced in a long time. Server said they were plating our food now. That was six minutes ago. Still no food. It makes me sad because the food is great, but the service is regularly terrible."}
{"text":"Some friends and I planned a trip to Phoenix for spring training with our sons. There were 30 of us total, so while we all wanted to have dinner together, we realized that it may not happen with a group that large during such a busy time. I sent out an email to pizza people the week before, not really expecting a response. I received a call the very next morning from the owner. I explained that there was a large group including a lot of kids, she told me she had the perfect area for us, a separate section of the restaurant not closed off but it's own little area. After being in Phoenix for a few days, and squeezing a lot of baseball in, you can imagine how tired we all were by the last night. When you're traveling with a group that large you can imagine how difficult it is to keep all the kids entertained so we were a little anxious about going out to dinner. When we walked in we were greeted by the owner who brought us to our section, it was perfect. The two servers came over and explained that they could split the checks by table or family \"whatever's easier\". I've worked in restaurants for a long time and realize how challenging this can be, so I asked if she was suite she was ok with doing it that way...\"no problem\" she said. All the food came out quickly, the burgers were light and juicy, seasoned perfectly. The pizza we're all delicious, with thin chewy crust. Not one item was forgotten, and to top it off the bills were all completely correct. I was thoroughly impressed by everything from the quality of the food, to the impeccable service here. If we decide to do this trip again, I will definitely be stopping by the pizza people Pub!"}
{"text":"The BBQ Pig N Chick Pizza has stood out as a favorite of mine. I enjoyed the Drewpy Fries despite them being a little saltier than I would have liked. The Garlic Monkey Bread is definitely a starter staple. The dipping sauce made it for me."}
{"text":"Pizza People Pub is an all around pleasurable experience. Since it's offerings include a very chill atmosphere, pleasant staff, creative dishes/appetizers, interesting cocktails, and fresh hand tossed  stone baked pizzas with a crispy crust chances are high you will not be disappointed!  Upon entering the pub, the dim lighting, chill vibe, local art and smiling staff made me want to hang out for a bit.  On my first visit Phillip was our bartender, and I can't say enough about his service. He took excellent care of us while enjoying our drinks at the bar. He not only made great drinks, but his sense of humor and down to earth attitude are what really made me not only partake in more than a few drinks, but definitely add it to my list of, \"Must return again soon spots!\" Thank you Philip! Hope your boss reads this!I highly recommend this place, especially those living in the area as this has \"regular spot\" potential."}
{"text":"We had a big assortment of food.  The Jamaican Jerk wings were yummy, not too spicy but great flavor.  I also loved the BBQ Pig n Chick pizza...bacon, chicken, bbq sauce, cheddar, and cilantro.  The Testosteroni was a favorite at the table as well.    We would go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Creative and fresh twist on favors. Ingredients are top notch. Service is usually great."}
{"text":"We loved it!   Stopped in around 6 on Saturday night before hitting the Phoenix Theatre. The place has a cool and modern vibe and the staff were quick and friendly. We started off with a couple glasses of vino and the 8oz of mushroom mac n cheese. It was perfect to share for an app, super fresh creamy cheesy goodness. (Pasta was al dente - we do like it a little more cooked but, it still was awesome)  We moved on to the pizza and ordered the \"popeye\" and added house made sausage and pepperoni - fantastic! Crust was crispy on the bottom but still, soft and chewy on top. Toppings evenly coated the pizza and the cheese was plentiful. Total bill for 3 vinos, pizza and small mac about $50 ($60 w/ tip). - not too bad. Overall, a cool place to stop in for drinks and a bite."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. It is my favorite pizza place ever!!! We initially found it because we were looking for Mac n' cheese, which they also have, but everything here has been great! My favorite pizza is the date me, and the Mac n' cheese is a must every time."}
{"text":"I wish I could shrink into a little person and dive into their mac and cheese haha their food was excellent the staff were so friendly and the atmosphere was fun inside and relaxing on the patio. They had a well balanced menu and good prices."}
{"text":"I first discovered this gem two years ago on my birthday and ever since I have been hooked. It is honestly so good, I am even willing to drive down to Phoenix to eat here alone, which as silly as that sounds is a pretty big deal! The Mac and Cheese is out of this world, you will not be disappointed. I have honestly been here more times than I can count and still haven't tried their pizza... haha! The pricing is reasonable and the atmosphere is great too. It is the perfect place for a date, girls nights out,  or a \"treat yourself night.\" I hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, Once was their opening night, and 2 other times since. The pizza is simply amazing. Decor in side is great, service is awesome. My favorite server is Nick, he seems to be really cool and always remembers me when I come in.   He also gave me a rundown of the history of this place, it started off a food truck and still is by the way, but they decided to start of this more permanent location very recently.   This place is located directly south of the old spaghetti factory, maybe 300 yards south. Come in, have a drink, lounge and eat, it's great!"}
{"text":"We have had their food truck and stopped in at their new location both times the food was good. They have a nice drink selection and you can't beat the location.  All in all a solid place to get a meal if your in the mood for pizza or a burger.  Our friends got small sides of Mac and cheese with bacon and loved it and the fun guy is a really good combo."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is awesome! I can't decide if I like it more inside with all fun local arts and owners timeline pics or outside, with a great view on a central avenue light rail....  We ordered pizza, wings and jalapenos mac-and-cheese. My favorite was mac-and-cheese. Pizza, I for sure had better but I would order pizza here again, no problem    Service was great. Our server checked on us many times, explained specials, filed our water in timely manner...loved it!  I would recommend this place for anyone to check out."}
{"text":"This place had great pizza if you are in the central Phoenix area. Nice little spot. The first time I came here, it was closed due to some power outage and I was craving pizza. Glad I came back the next day because I enjoyed it. They have a pretty decent happy hour on drinks only though."}
{"text":"Went here last week for a work lunch and got to try quite a few items. I was extremely impressed and can't wait to go back. I can't remember the name of the pizza, but it had jalapeno cream cheese, bacon and avocado and it was freakin amazing!!! I also tried a bite of the vaquero burger which is quite hearty and also very tasty. Get the mac n cheese, just do it. I had the truffle mac and it was to die for. Bruchetta was awesome too.   Cool decor with swanky fun chairs. The staff was on point and I was very happy with the service. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  Owner is very personable and willing to talk to you/explain new drinks.  Great selection of AZ beers and wines!  The food is great as well- recommend the jalapeño Mac and cheese, but all of it is good."}
{"text":"We went the next to last day they are open. Service was very good but they were out of some ingredients for pizza. Too bad they are out of business. We would've gone back."}
{"text":"Very cute place on central. Like the art and dining set up.  I had Lunch of \"date me\" pizza and \"white parm & corn\" Mac & cheese both were pretty freakin' good. I love the eclectic food that burst of flavors!"}
{"text":"The MB Chop salad was delicious! I'm a big fan of a well-done salad, and this one hit the spot! A great variety of fresh, crisp vegetables (jicama! zucchini!) topped with creamy ranch dressing and parmesan cheese. YUM!  The restaurant was clean and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly! The place was not crowded at all, for a weekday at noon. There was also plenty of parking available in their private lot (on the north side of the restaurant), which is a big WIN for downtown restaurants! If this lot fills up on a busier day, you can also park in additional lots, either south of the restaurant, or at the library across the street. I will definitely come back for another yummy salad, a pizza, or their $5 wine happy hour!"}
{"text":"While they say their pizza people, what they really excel at is their amazing variety of Mac and Cheese!  We have had several flavors however our favorite is the buffalo mini mac and cheese with added shredded chicken.  We usually get a couple mini's and share them.  We also find their wings to be a great deal with more than just celery on the side you really get some tasty treats with it.  Although I am not a fan of their house ranch personally, I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time on a Wednesday night.   It was empty at 7pm at night. Pretty clean. Nice setup. Me and my family got seated immediately.   Our server came and greated us. He was pretty nice. We ordered mac and cheese with bacon, a burger with coleslaw, and a cheese pizza.   The mac and cheese with bacon was creamy but over salted. My teeth hurt from too much salt! The burger was ordered medium rare and came out well done. The coleslaw was runny and tart. Pizza was good.   Nothing too special about this place. Quite a first experience. THE END!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for dinner with my boyfriend and I don't think we will be returning anytime soon. We decided to try the Korean Mac and cheese as an appetizer but it came out 2 minutes before our pizzas. The presentation was photo worthy but the flavor hindered the picture taking. Nothing about this macaroni and cheese said Korean. Although the noodles were cooked perfectly the sauce reminded me of Kraft cheese sauce with some sriracha in it. I also ordered a small Caesar salad not much to rave about there, traditional and the dressing was served on the side. Next, the pizzas. Aesthetically pleasing but flavor didn't meet expectations. I ordered the Popeye, add mushrooms. Described on the menu, red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, tomatoes, garlic and basil. The sauce lacked in flavor and could be called bland and I hardly tasted any garlic on the pizza. Maybe that's what I get for ordering vegetarian. My boyfriend got the testosteroni and subbed the ground beef with prosciutto. His pizza definitely had more flavor but only because of the meat trio on top of it. Their house made Italian sausage was good, I'll give them that but I would hardly call their pizza artisan. You could throw a bunch of interesting toppings on dough but if the crust and flavor profile isn't right, it isn't artisan. I also asked for a side of ranch when the pizzas came and was given a dressing but you could hardly call it ranch. It was more of a creamy sauce with an overpowering dill flavor. The ambience was nice, modern and casual but service was slow and food was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza place! Very friendly service, and pizza on the better side of average. I was most impressed with the garlic monkey bread appetizer.  I'll definitely return the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times. We all like the food and the service is great.  On this last visit it was Fathers Day. There was six of us and we wanted to watch the 2016 NBA final game which we weren't sure how busy it would be. It was perfect just enough people there so we were seated right away in front of 1 of the 3 TV's.  Wooohooo!  We ordered the Testostroni pizza, the Marghuerita pizza, Date Me pizza, honey ginger soy wings and regular wings. We all share because we love the combination of the different flavores for each of the pizzas. The pizzas are 10 inches thin, crispy and delicious. The wings are crispy and flavorful and I love the fresh veggies on the side: cucumber, carrots, Italian zucchini and celery. They have a variety of drinks for all the different taste buds in our group. Perfect atmosphere for hanging out and eating."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. All around great! Their vegan pizza is probably the best in the valley."}
{"text":"I live down the street and dine in/pick up about once a week. The menu is great, with lots of flavor and price variety. No matter my mood I can always find something that sounds good. There's happy hour 7 days a week and a great selection of beer and wine.  Pizza People Pub now creates \"nearly zero waste\", having adopted a composting system for any food waste, and switching from a dumpster to a Republic Services recycling bin. I love when a business shows willingness to adapt and hope that they influence other restaurants in the area.  Even on their busier nights the service is always fantastic. Specific kudos to Drew, Nick and owner MaryBeth for always remembering us and coming over to say hi."}
{"text":"Came by with a large group for my husband's birthday last night. It was a last minute decision and the staff was more than accommodating.  They put a 20 top together and viola the party was started. Our server got us drinks, ASAP. The Huckleberry Punch, probably will be my new go to beverage. Tart and sweet but not overpowering.  The decor is eclectic and comfortable. My favorite is the wall of photos of the owners in a timeline of their food truck and the build out of The Pub.   We went strong on the appetizers and ordered everything!  The monkey bread and cheesy poofs were great. We even got the pigs in a blanket.  My favorite was the corn and parmesan Mac and Cheese.  As for the Pizza fantastic! I have been a fan of their food truck, so excited to be able to grab some Pie when they are not on the streets. I do have to say, small businesses are my true love. I fall in love with story behind a small business as much as the food. This one is a best seller. Tim,MB and baby S you should be proud!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times have been excellent! I met a friend on a hot Saturday for drinks and a bite. When I walked in, I was immediately approached for assistance. When I said I would wait for my friend, she then offered me some water while I waited (she probably saw I was sweaty! lol).  We sat down and our waiter shows up asking to take our order and offers suggestions. We get our drinks fast, take our order and the food comes out nice and warm. PERFECT!  The waiter kept checking in on us asking if everything was ok.  They have GREAT pizzas! The Hottie is my favorite as the same for the Korean wings. YUM! Bloody Mary's are also great!"}
{"text":"Yummers!   We ate there for the first time tonight. It was finally cool enough to sit outside. Loved it.  We had the Drewpy Potatoes and were all impressed.  At our table, two of us had salads and two had pizza. Everyone was very happy with their choice.  Will definitely go again soon."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pleasantly surprised at this awesome restaurant!  The food was so good.  If you are a Mac and cheese fan, you cannot miss this!  The pizza was great and the pesto hummus was yummy!  Oh and can't forget the Monkey garlic balls.  So good!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Pizza People to watch the Super Bowl game on Sunday.  I'm so glad we did.  They had a buffet for $10 that had Mac & Cheese, wings, salad and a variety of pizzas.  It was a great way to try out all the pizzas that they had at a great price.  My favorite we the mushroom and sweet potato pizza and the Mac & Cheese with corn in it.    Our waitress was awesome.  She was really sweet very helpful and brought our drinks out really quick and water glasses were always full.    I have been to pizza people a couple of times now and I know I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night, the place was pretty quiet. Sam at the bar was very helpful. I asked for some suggestions, he ran through pros, cons and substitutions that he and others like. I tried some whiskey, had a beer and wine. Overall he was a great bartender and the food was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"For years I have been driving past the spot along central ave that Pizza People Pub now occupies and thinking \"What a cozy, inviting outdoor patio, I need to visit sometime\", and I never did. I was so sad when Cheuvront closed down because I thought I would never get the chance.  Pizza People Pub renewed my hope in my long lost dream! Not only is the location wonderful, but the food here is excellent. As soon as I glanced over the menu I knew instantly that I would have to make a return trip - the choices are plentiful and each item looks amazing! This time around, we opted to split the smoky paprika Mac n cheese mini, and we each got our own pizza. I got the Kauai Not pizza (basic Hawaiian) and my husband got the Testosteroni. Very very good! Basic, thin crust with good quality toppings- although my pineapples tasted like they might have been the canned variety. But either way, it was good. The Mac n cheese was probably the highlight for both of us - it was baked in a little tin to crispy perfection on top with a creamy interior. The alcohol selection was good here, and I loved sitting out on the patio watching the light rail go by! Especially in the cooler weather and being so close to our house, this will become a go-to spot for sure!"}
{"text":"In an effort to try a new place at least once a week, I opted in for Pizza People Pub. They had starters, pies (pizza), salads, and sandwiches. More importantly, they had pretty favorable reviews from my fellow Yelpers.  It's true what they say that parking is a questionable activity. They are located adjacent to what looks like an apartment building and then am empty lot. I parked in one place and questioned it, so I moved my car again.  When I walked in I was greated promptly. I asked if I could sit at the bar and sat down. The bartender didn't see me but someone on the other side of the bar mentioned that I sat down (come to find out it was one of the Chefs.. how cool). I ended up moving to the other side of the bar were I interacted with Devin. Super patience, helpful, and friendly bartender.  I told him I wanted everything *insert my eyes were bigger than my stomach*.. so what does this mean.. I narrowed my selections to Oven Roasted Wings tossed in the Buffalo sauce with blue cheese and veggies Red, White, Blue Salad Seoul Fire pizza  So as my food came out, I realized EPIC fail, but I had to sample everything. The wings were DELICIOUS. their Blue Cheese dressing is not that traditional clumpy stuff either. whatever they put in it.. VERY Good. I had a slice of the pizza.. I think it's an acquired tasted.. at Kim Chee isn't one of those things you run and say I have to have it. AND I saved the BEST for last. This salad was amazingggggggggg. It was fresh and plentiful and I didn't feel bad after eating it. I just don't know how else to describe it but amazing.  What I thought was equally cool was that I was trying to determine the pizza and the CHEF was like get this. I said I don't eat that.. he said SUB it.. You NEVER hear people so open to you changing items on the menu..   I will totally be back. Don't be surprised if it's this week on next week."}
{"text":"I decided to try PPP because of the yelp reviews and boy am I glad I did! It was so good. The macaroni was what really caught my eye when looking through yelp, so I decided to try to the buffalo mac and it was so creamy and cheesy. It also had a good spice to it. It was delicious! I also tried the hottie pizza and it was also pretty good. The marinara sauce was great and the crust was perfect. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have tried their bleu salad, the popeye pizza, the hottie pizza and their sun dried tomato mac n cheese and everything was amazing. The pizza is just so crispy and perfect. Have been here several times and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First, GREAT customer service!!! High marks.    The food was nothing daring, it's pizza; but very enjoyable. Wings were good, as was the salad, (which is odd cause usually you dismiss the salad).   It's a good value, there are better pizza places, but I will put this place on rotation."}
{"text":"You know those people who add salt to everything? Like, hey, look at these salt covered corn chips ... they look like they could use at least 6 more shakes of salt on them. Don't forget the salsa! It probably needs more as well. Don't want to lose any precious salt when I dip the chip into it.   I think that is the philosophy of Pizza People. The more salt the better. That's pretty much all I tasted. The food was so salty, my friend had four glasses of water with his meal. It was so salty, that 20 minutes later, when I saw a public drinking fountain, I about pushed my boyfriend out of the way to use it. I don't think I've ever been so excited to see a public water source.   In case you are wondering, we all got some variation of mac & cheese. My friend raved about the mac & cheese pizza. He was so into it in fact, that he declared he would not be sharing because it just wasn't worth it. How can you not be interested after a statement like that? Instead of getting it on a pizza, though, I decided to order mac & cheese the old fashioned way. I just couldn't bring myself to eat it on top of a pizza. I mean, that is some serious shit. I already like food way too much. We don't need to get Morgan addicted to mac & cheese pizza. Sadly, though, the mac & cheese was not very good. Like I said, all I tasted was salt. My friend ended up letting me have a piece of his pizza for comparison, again, it was highly salted. Just a big disappointment. Nothing is a bigger turn off than overly salted food. It's the biggest food crime out there next to putting truffle oil on everything. Spread the word and stop the madness.   On the bright side, service was great."}
{"text":"I really like this place but have always had crazy experiences there. In November I took my dad there for his birthday, my sister who is vegan ordered a salad without cheese. They bring her the salad with cheese of course. She asks them to take it back, they finally bring it when everyone is almost done.. And she takes a first bite and finds a bug in her food. After that she didn't want anything. There was no discount offered at the time of our service either. So last night I give it a try again. And again everything came out wrong. The server offers different hot sauces and my friend orders one only to have their server come back and say we only have this one. They brought us our pizza and they didn't even slice it for us. I ordered Mac and cheese and it was all burnt. The server apologizes and says the cooks are trying to close up... We were the last ones. Like I said I really like this place.. They are just always messing stuff up. So because they mess up all the time and we found a bug in our food and no compensation u get 2 stars PPP. Try and get it together!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the fly one day during happy hour, they have a great special! Got a Hawaiian pizza and the homemade meatballs. The pizza was delicious! The meatballs look amazing, 2 decent sized meatballs come per serving. Sadly they were dry and hard to eat.  I will defiantly come back again to get their Mac and cheese, I didn't read the reviews before coming and missed out this time around. So I'm sure I'll be updating my review on this place soon."}
{"text":"Today, I tried Pizza People Pub for the first time. I was very impressed! I had the cesar side salad and 5 BAKED wings! Both were delicious! I can't wait to go back and try the pizza! It looked amazing! I was there with about 6 other Yelpers and they all said it was good! Everyone had something different and there was not one complaint!   Besides the food, the staffer that assisted our table was great. I really have no complaints. I would give it 5 stars, but I have yet to try the pizza. I'll update this once I do."}
{"text":"1st time, came in on a Sunday. It was quiet and cool. They have a full bar,  pizza was delicious and best Mac n cheese around. Will definitely return and the service was awesome, friendly, made recommendations and was attentive without being intrusive."}
{"text":"I have to thank Angels Trumpet Ale House and Pomo for being closed on Monday nights for us trying Pizza People Pub.  We had such a good time the first time that we returned two days later.  My husband and I met up with our buddy Tim S. prior to the St. Louis Cardinals games and were looking for pizza.  Pizza People Pub was in the back of my mind because I had read some good reviews for this place from Monica O. and Jon H.    The 5-star review starts with easy, free parking and then a great atmosphere.  The decor and furniture are some of the coolest I've seen in a long time.  Love the chairs.  We were greeted and seated right away.    In two visits we tried the monkey bread, spud fingers, and pigs in blankies for apps, and four different pizzas: Testosteroni, the Manny, the Hottie, and the Pig N Chick.  All the pizzas were very fresh and flavorful with a perfect yeasty crust.  I think my favorite pizza was the Testosteroni, but they were all great.  All the apps were delicious as well.  And don't get me started on the $4 Drink of the Day.  What a great deal!  The first one we tried on Monday was the Basil Mojito and that was really refreshing and light.  I love the fresh basil.  Then on Wednesday we had the Cucumber Rickey and it was very nice as well.  Those $4 drinks come in a pint glass and are a great deal!  Brandon took great care of us on Monday and Beki was really friendly and funny on Wednesday.  Overall I can't think of anything I didn't love about this place.  The food, service, and prices are all perfect.  I am trying to think of a reason to be in that area again soon so I can try some more menu items.  I think we'll go back and cheer for the home team against the stinky Dodgers.  Except for Chase Utley.  He's not stinky."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is a decent group of eccentric young professionals, but the food is a diverse garden of flavors."}
{"text":"My kinda spot in the Roosevelt Historic District, within walking distance of my Loft. Pizzas are TASTY, the service is professional, EXCELLENT clientel, priced right. What's there not to like ?"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weeknight while in town with the family.. Except for a few other diners, I was surprised that this place was otherwise pretty empty..   The place was very clean with a cozy atmosphere, nice for a date or a group. Service was friendly and they checked on us often.. Food was just a tiny bit slow in coming out, but not too bad...   We had their monkey bread as an appetizer.. Little bite size pcs of bread.. Had a slight crunch but chewy and doughy inside. A yummy buttery/garlic taste that went well with their ranch and tomato dipping sauces...   We also had their Mac n Cheese... There's several kinds to choose from, and you can customize it more with add ons. We kept it simple and got their Parmesan and corn Mac n cheese... Great flavor, not to salty... Very dense and creamy! It's definitely filling. We got a 20oz which looks like way more than 20oz and shared it amongst 3 of us... I wish I remember the names of the pizzas we got... One was with mushroom and truffle oil and arugula. (The arugula was a bit overpowering, but very good).. And another that my husband chose with meats... Their pizzas are 10inch thin crust... Each had very good tastes and textures..   Approved!"}
{"text":"This is a solid lunch choice for Midtown. I was a little disappointed to find out that there were no lunch specials when I went in, because I heard they had some great lunch deals... but I was still happy to  pay full-price for my meal.  To start I ordered a side Caesar salad with their house made ranch instead of Caesar dressing (which was not vegetarian).  The salad was pretty basic, nothing to brag about... but the pizza made the meal better! Not feeling in the mood for truffle oil, I ordered the Fungi pizza with pesto instead. It was very good, flakey crust and just the right amount of cheese and sauce, the fresh arugula on top made it taste \"healthier\" too =).  If you're on your lunch break, plan ahead.  The pizza takes about 20 minutes to cook, which they kindly warn you about on the menu.  Overall it was a very nice experience, the staff was very attentive and the food was good, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm really bummed to see another local favorite closing it's doors. Pizza People Pub has been operating out of this location across the Phoenix Public library since 2013. They have a great story of a family owned business starting out of a food truck and eventually opening their own restaurant. Their menu consists of their signature made-from-scratch 10 inch artisan pizzas and a variety of pub favorites like wings and their always popular mac & cheese. I always got a kick out of some of the pizza creations that they have (and the names) - Date Me, The Hulk, Testosteroni, Popeye, Fun Guy, The Hottie, etc. Even though I love their pizzas, I usually came here to try one of their many mac & cheeses. Some of my favorites have been the Smokey Paprika Mac, the Jalapeño Mac and the Truffle Mac. They load their mac & cheese with lots of cheese so they are nice and gooey. I wish they had a mac & cheese flight so I could sample them all. I stopped in tonight to have a last meal here before they close shop. I enjoyed hearing my bartender share stories of how much he enjoyed working here. It's always sad to hear of local restaurants going out of business. I wish them the best."}
{"text":"Yet again I find another food truck that has decided to take the plunge into brick and mortarville.  This time its arguably Phoenix's most popular pizza food truck.  I've never tried Pizza People prior to this, but I'm always ready for a shot at some good pizza.  I live just down the street from this building (which used to be Cheuvront's), so my girlfriend and I decided to satisfy our curiousity.  The place retains some of the charm that Cheuvront's had, with a very modern restaurant feel, but they've definitely put their own stamp on the place from the bar to the furniture and the staff.  I knew they had their big opening the night before so the crowd was pretty light tonight and with the weather improving, we decided to sit out on the patio.  We decided to start off with their signature cocktail, the Grande Pub Shrub.  They mix it in a mason jar and let you pour it yourself (its meant to be shared by two).  Very unusual drink.  Not bad, just different.  Its like an epic battle between grapefruit and jalapeno in your mouth.  If you try it you'll see what I mean.  For an appetizer, we actually decided to do the mac and cheese jars.  They're small enough to take down yourself, but you can share as well.  I got the spicy buffalo mac with chicken.  She got the Korean sweet and spicy mac with beef.  I have to admit, I liked her's better as the flavors were very subtle but melded very well together.  Mine was good, but they weren't kidding about the spicy part.  It was like a really hot chicken wing.  And then, it was time for pizza.  I looked over the Yelp reviews about this place when it was just a truck and it seemed the Popeye was the biggest favorite of the bunch so I went with that.  I was looking for something on the lighter side and this satisfied it.  The spinach, tomato and basil gave it really good flavor (though I think it could've used a little more tomato).  She got the Date Me, which more or less tasted like a salad with goat cheese on a pizza.  The prosciutto was a great addition, though our server recommended we should add bacon next time (I think he's right).  For dessert, we ordered the peach cobbler, but they were out, so we went with the chocolate cake with ice cream.  It came in a jar just like the mac and cheese jars, but was plenty rich enough to satisfy both of us.  All totaled, dinner tally was about $55 with tip.  The owner even came by to thank us for coming and asked us for any feedback good or bad.  Food was good and had lots of fun and unusual items that you can customize to make it your own.  It wouldn't be fair to compare this place to a Pomo, Cibo, or Bianco as this is nothing like those spots.   The Pizza People folks are doing pizza their own way (along with the rest of their menu).  If you want just strictly traditional, then Cibo, Bianco, or Pomo are probably more your thing.  But if you're feeling adventurous or just looking for a new twist on some old favorites, by all means give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Tried this quaint little Pizza place on a Saturday evening. We were expecting good things because we read the reviews on YELP. We were not at all disappointed. Nice, clean, friendly servers (see punctuation changes everything....actually, the place was nice & clean & I assume the servers were too;-). I ordered the garlic monkey rolls & jalapeno mac & cheese. The small size was too big to finish. My hubby ordered the 'pub burger' (he IS a burger connoisseur) and actually told the server ( I forgot her name) it was the best burger he's ever had. The portions are huge and the service was excellent. We will  go back again. If  I had to pick a not so nice word to say it would be  that the music was (JUST a tad bit) loud and could stand to be turn down a notch or two (my opinion only) - but other than that..EXCELLENT!!!!  Great dining experience"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been here about 5 times in the past 2months. Wings awesome, Mac and cheese amazing, the Kingston burger is the best. I haven't even had a pizza yet but they always look and smell amazing.  Everything is made in the oven too. It's really big inside and even when they are busy you don't feel like your on top of others. I was there for New Years Eve and there was plenty of room for everyone."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  We ordered an appetizer, mac n cheese, and pizza and they all were delicious! I would recommend this to anyone! The server and other staff were extremely helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to watch the game last night and we had a great time. Service was really attentive and the food was good.   The style and decor was cure, and fit the trendy area well. The menu had several things go to choose from and was easy to navigate.   We got a pizza, Mac and cheese and some wings. We tried some of the sauces and everything was pretty good! I'd definitely come back. Reasonable prices good quality if food. My only complaint was our pizza crust wasn't crisp. It was just a tad too doughy."}
{"text":"First time in, place looks amazing!!! Came in, sat down at a table and the seats were comfy!!! (Ohh la la!)  The service was prompt and friendly. I don't drink much, so I had a water, but refills were still prioritized! Awesome!! The food was good too. Their pizzas are 10\" with 6 slices. Some may have an issue with size, but for 2-3 people it's adequate. The pizza was ok, I feel it could be a bit better.   Overall, you have my recommendation!"}
{"text":"Lately I tend to go back to a place a few times before giving a review, and Pizza People Pub is no exception to this recent trend. On my first visit I came during their opening week for a Downtowner's Lunch UYE. They had $5 specials this week on many of their pizzas and salads. Of course, we all ordered two items and left over stuffed that particular day. The salad was so tasty that I might actually be willing to admit that I liked it more than the pizza, whaaat? Did I just say that out loud?  For the Super Bowl (2014), Pizza People put out a pizza, appetizer and salad buffet. Best pizza buffet in town. I've seen them do a pizza buffet once or twice since and it's worth every penny of the $15 or $20 per person they charge for it.  I've been back for a random lunch once or twice since, and the quality is always good, but still not my favorite pizza in town. If you love salads, I would suggest you come here, order a salad, and leave ecstatic that you just had a fantastic salad. If you're here for the pizza, everyone has their own opinion, and everyone seems to have their own favorite. This isn't my personal favorite, but I'd never say no if friends wanted to go here for the random lunch or dinner.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. If you haven't yet picked your favorite pizza in Phoenix (and even if you have), be sure to stop by Pizza People Pub!"}
{"text":"Love it here....great food, amazing house made ranch, and they recycle & compost which is great. The mushroom/truffle pizza is ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Had one of the best vegan gluten-free pizzas I've ever had (with truffle mushroom toppings). The service was excellent and the chairs were super comfortable. Prices were reasonable and parking was free and easy in the lot. Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  We wanted pizza and decided to try this place. I got the Hottie Pizza. It's a combination of Italian sausage, Jalapeños, Serranos and green chilies. Sounds hot, but it just had a nice kick and awesome flavor. What a great combination!!! Great place for drinks too.  Try the Monkey Bread for a app too!"}
{"text":"Picked this place because I thought it was kid friendly. Most definitely NOT! They do not have a kid's menu and the only thing you can order is mac and cheese or pizza. Service was at a minimum standard. I have received better service at chain restaurant. When the server approached our table he took a moment as to not know what to say, he made no suggestions to appetizers or drinks, and did not take off the mac & cheese that was awful."}
{"text":"What a great first experience!    I ordered the pizza From Brussels with Love sans the bacon.  The only bad thing about this visit was the server either didn't hear me or forgot to ask to have the bacon removed but she fixed it quickly and with a smile so I really didn't mind.  Service was excellent, the pizza was amazing and I fell in love with the high back leather chairs.  I will be coming back here often."}
{"text":"Mrs and I received a gift card to the Pizza People Pub.  Since it had good yelp ratings we decided to go there today for late lunch...about 2 pm.  Not too many people there.  Waitress was full of personality and we liked her straight away. We both had a testeroni pizza and we both couldn't remember having a better pizza.  We enjoyed our lunch very much. Hostess said they've only been open for about two months. We're already making plans to go there next Friday and taking a friend with us."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood pub!! Centrally located and room for all!! Love it. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"While this isn't your typical pizza joint, it is definitely worth it for foodies who love interesting pizza and so many other types of food fare.  I've now been twice (it took me forever to write this review) and the second time was even tastier than the first.  The crowd here is relaxed and the atmosphere is one that I can't get enough of...dare I say it is hip?  And not in that annoying hipster way either.  The easiest way for me to get through this review is to list off what we all ate...otherwise the drool will soak this keyboard and I'll never finish.  Honey Ginger Soy Wings: perfectly crispy and flavorful...plenty to go around and share with others too Drewpy Fries:  Don't question this one at all!  If you like fries...get it!  These are not your average cheesy soggy fries you can get at any bar either.  The fingerling potatoes are on par and the prosciutto along with the cheese sauce is to die for! The Hulk (pizza):  I thought this one was just so so.  But this is probably because of the other types we ate overpowered it. The Hottie (pizza):  hot is an understatement!  Prepare to be slobbering with your tongue hanging out, but it's worth it!  The jalapenos and serano peppers make this one hot but the sausage and basil pack a punch of flavor too White Parm and Corn Mac:  I chomped off of a friend's and am not a huge fan of mac and cheese, but this one is definitely tasty and worth a short if you like cheesy goodness Churro-Style Rolled Pizza Dough:  this one was recommended by our waiter after we couldn't decide on what to pick.  It was hot and crispy.  It was by far better than your average churro since it was made from pizza dough and super chocolatey! Coronado Orange Avenue Wit:  A canned beer but nice and refreshing...nice and orangey hefeweizen.  Nothing like Shocktop at all.  We will be back for sure...mostly for the Drewpy Fries and The Hottie pizza!  It's close to the lightrail stop and worth more than one trip to try multiple things from their menu.  They did start out as a food truck a ways back, so they do like to play with interesting ingredients.  Get yourself some!"}
{"text":"Meh . . . Have had much better. Pies are small, single serving, and not inexpensive. Nice crowd and some decent music, but atmosphere won't fill your wine glass. Mine was the smallest serving of a house wine that I've seen in years. These folks are cheap.  Our waiter was slow, and when he brought the bill, he brought a comment card for us to fill out that was already filled in. This restaurant is trying so hard to be cool, to have \"real, Italian\" pizzas, and they're not making it. To the owners, I would say it's worth the drive one weekend to visit Cottonwood, Arizona where they can stop at Pizzeria Bocce. That's a true, one of a kind gourmet pizza restaurant with the same style of \"cool\" they are going for here at the Pizza People Pub."}
{"text":"First off Dan our bartender was super AMAZING!  HE WAS VERY attentive and fun ! Our Margarita Pizza was fantastic!  The pizza crust had so much flavor! We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I came here after lunch hour for a beer and a small meal to hold over my hunger til din din. Beer was good but what blew me from my seat was that Mac n' Cheese. The bartender with the personality suggested I try it with bacon and bleu cheese. Oh my goodness was that f@$%&? great. I tried to order more food but Jamie the tender mention that one small dish would be plenty and he was right. If that one thing was amazing, I'm definitely coming back for more with more people. Great service, exceptional food and good beer. You'll have me here more than once a month."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today at almost 1pm. The place was almost empty. I was hoping for pizza but it took our server so long to attend to us (only 3 other tables with people in the place, and two parties left before we ordered) that I didn't think we could wait the 15 extra minutes the menu says the pizza takes. I should have. As it was it took almost thirty minutes to get two sandwiches, three salads and a quesadilla.  The bill for my order came to $16 for a blt and iced tea. I'm not really impressed."}
{"text":"As if we didn't have enough great pizza places downtown!  At least the new pizza places are all good, so many options for quality pizza in our neighborhood.  We stopped in Saturday evening for dinner...great crowd with a good vibe, nice space, and great pizza.  The names for the pizza are really cute...I tried the Kauai Knot...basically a Hawaiian pizza and it was super tasty!    It was a little warm in the restaurant and the service was somewhat slow, but all in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that's open till 10pm! Their pizza is quite good, although slightly overpriced for the size in my opinion, but that's what you get in the Theater District. The food was slightly slow in coming around 9pm, but our waiter was very friendly, Can't complain!"}
{"text":"Pizza People Pub wow'd me last night .. but it wasn't just the pizza that wow'd me. After wanting to try PPP for awhile now, I figured a cool day in Phoenix was a great time to stop in and check out the reason this place always looks so busy. Upon entering Pizza People Pub, I immediately loved the decor: Big black wing chairs at the tables; orange couches around tables and trendy high top tables; the art on the wall and dim lights just set the mood for a chic and trendy place with a laid back atmosphere. The patio is lit with clear lights , patio heaters for the cooler months and is very cute and open.  PPP has a great happy hour and a drink special daily. Todays special drink of the day was a mojito for $4! I like to have wine with my pizza and even though the menu has more than just pizzas, I knew I wanted pizza and wine tonight. That said, my hubby ordered the mojito. This drink didn't come in the usual 'small glass because its on special or happy hour' type glass, this mojito was tall! It was served in a pint glass; hand shaken and made fresh. $5 wines on happy hour and the beer and wine menu are filled with options for anyones taste. As I already mentioned, PPP has not only pizza here, but as the name suggests: Pub fare. There are sandwiches, great salads, and some amazing appetizers. PPP also has a very wide selection what I like to call , 'grown up' mac and cheese selections that aren't the kind of mac and cheese your momma used to make! Pizza People Pub has mac and cheese on the menu with truffle oil; jalepeno; or a Korean sweet and spicy to intrigue your grown up taste buds; they also come in a mini 8 ounce size or a biggie 20 ounce serving! Mmmmmmm  Tonight we opted for two pizzas to share. We figured that was the name and our first time here should be all about tasting the tempting pies. I ordered the Fun Guy. I tend to go for 'white' pizzas when out for a gourmet pizza experience and this one was nothing short of divine. The Fun Guy was a base of mozzarella, mushrooms, and truffle oil over an amazing crust that was a bit garlic-y in taste and perfectly baked not too crisp and not un-done. The Fun Guy on the PPP menu comes with arugula, but I am not really into arugula on my pizzas, so I asked that be deleted and added with prosciutto. I loved my Fun Guy! My husband ordered The Manny. Manny is different, but in a good way! It tantalizes your taste buds with a base of red sauce, a jalepeno cream cheese, pepperoni, onion and bacon and topped with fresh avocado slices. All pizzas are 10 inches in size and range from about $9.95 to $12.25 which isn't bad considering they are made fresh artisan style from a family recipe, hand tossed, made with fresh sustainable ingredients and baked in stone decked ovens. There are also gluten free options available. I like having that option too. At one point there was only one pizza place in Phoenix that offered gluten free pizza and anyone with dietary restrictions, well, was restricted on being able to enjoy pizza! Both my husband and I left being very full and having leftovers for the next day.  I really loved Pizza People Pub, its atmosphere, its bar and its location in the downtown Central Phoenix area. Our waiter, JP, was great. He was super polite, informative, he never let our water glasses go empty, which is super important to me, and was always smiling and on his waiter game the entire time. There is ample free parking and again, I really liked the specials advertised. I really must come back and try more of what PPP has to offer. The dessert menu looked amazing, but we were so full on pizza, dessert would have put us into a food coma right there and we would have been napping on one of those cozy, inviting couches for the night!  Pizza People.. you did good! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food.  Rad service.  Only thing preventing me from giving them five stars is the fact they got rid of their brussel's sprout pizza.  I would come here much more often if they still had it"}
{"text":"The service at this place is usually very good which gives this place some points in my book.  The food isn't too shabby either.  The Date Me Pizza is good if you want something a little sweet and salty and The Hottie Pizza is good but very spicy.  They have buckets of PBR for practically free (5 for 13 dollars)"}
{"text":"So far, this place never disappoints! I get the biggie mac-n-cheese (buffalo style) and add chicken and its fabulous every time! Also, the hummus platter is a must-try. Delicious."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and have loved it every time!  Great food, great beer selection, great patio! Please support this restaurant! They support our running group's activities throughout the year and we plan on going back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Beer selection is ok. The real reason to come here is for Mac & Cheese (m&c). Mirrored the Korean Mac and the blue cheese with meatballs, both were awesome. Also, jalapeño halves with bacon were the hotness. Will be back just for Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and very accommodating to food allergies. I highly appreciate vegan cheese and gluten free crust options. I especially love the \"funguy\"."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My favorite pizza to get is the Date Me pizza. Soooo good! The 'doll' ranch they make in house is delicious! The staff are very friendly and the location is great! If the light rail is a form of transport for you than this place is the place for you! I love very much and always am excited to return."}
{"text":"The white parm and corn mac is amazing. Best mac and cheese I've had in a very long time. The mini with a cup of soup was more than enough food for lunch. The atmosphere was nice, the music wasn't too loud, and the staff were friendly. They had a full bar but I did not have anything to drink besides iced tea. I think I'll try this place again. Maybe for dinner next time."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here tonight. Delicious food and drinks, great service, good music, cool and comfortable space in a great location (with parking!). It was a fantastic experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  Server was awesome and treated us like we were the only ones there.  My wife has celiac disease and their gluten free pizza was awesome.  Good variety on the menu, drink prices are hard to beat.  The bartender's choice is interesting and you can buy small pitchers of mixed drinks at really great prices."}
{"text":"Incredible! We had an amazing dinner there last night with some dear friends. They sat us right away and had phenomenal service all night. They were quick, and even kept refilling our drinks an hour after we paid. The pizza and Mac N Cheese were delicious! If your in the area - definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is painfully slow. I've been here a dozen times and the service is lacking every time even when the place is practically empty, hence the three stars. If I were to rate based on the food alone, I'd give it 4. The mac and cheese is killer and so are the drewpy fries. Cool decor and nice little patio, too!"}
{"text":"Kind of a cool hidden place. Not hard to get to but \"hidden\" because who takes Central Ave south of McDowell Rd? The pizza was quality but I was very disappointed in the mac and cheese. I got the parmesan with jalapeño. It came out warm, not hot, and had a weird texture. Seating is a little awkward with the huge arm chairs. Made it hard to sit up right to eat. Might come back one day."}
{"text":"Great drink prices! I  especially enjoyed the $4 basil mojito which is their all day Monday drink special. $5 house red and white wines all the time. I have been there a few times recently with friends and sharing a pizza and a mini mac is the perfect amount of food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Excellent pizzas & burgers.  Awesome drinks.  Overall - we really like this place.  My only complaint -- the service is slow.  The last time we were there, we told our server that we needed to leave for a play.  He proceeded to walk off, take orders at a few other tables, go into the kitchen and then walk up to the front door to talk to some of the other servers.  Meh."}
{"text":"This place was close to us when we were feeling hungry so we thought we'd give it a try.  It environment is reminiscent of the hipster boom in restaurants here near downtown Phoenix.  We were here on a Sunday at 12:00 pm.  It was pretty empty, apart from a few other people.  This meant that speed of service and food pre and arrival was quick.  Mac and cheese was standard and baked.  My wife had the vaquero burger which she loved because It was barbecued and had crispy onions.  She loves crispy onions.  Also standard here were the fingerlings (small potatoes cut in half, fried and then baked) instead of fries.  But the wife loved the burger.  The server could have asked us if we wanted a high seat for our toddler (she didn't) but service was generally okay.  Nothing special or memorable about the service or this place.  The pizza (I had a simple pepperoni) is also standard so it doesn't stick out to me, though for the price I've had better.    Generally a decent place but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Jp was our server and he was wonderful! We had wine, a chopped salad, the potato fingers and buffalo Mac and cheese. Open late, affordable, friendly and delicious! Also, super cozy and nothing pretentious about it. Just good stuff. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The key to life: Mini Mac & Cheese jars at the Pizza People Pub!  How can you go wrong with truffle oil and bacon Mac and Cheese??  This is the brick and mortar restaurant for the Pizza People Food Truck that we have all chased for years!  Definitely check it out soon!  They took over the old Cheuvront's space on central. They just opened so give them a shot!!  Our waitress Tonya was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Sooo, we went to Pizza People because it was down the street from theatres like All Puppet Players, and Phoenix Theatre, and Nearly Naked Theatre. THEN we decided to try it for brunch one Sunday. Marvelous! Same friendly, efficient staff. Great food. Great location."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I really did. I have followed them since they were only a food truck, and the first couple of times I visited was great. But after the last 3 visits I can not give them higher than 3 stars.   Where to begin? They can not cook a medium hamburger, its been well and medium well, but never medium. The service has been hit or miss. You either get a really great server or someone who will literally ignore you unless you hunt them down. My wife's mac and cheese pizza was not cooked properly and was extremely greasy. We have had to talk to both of the owners about issues, and to their credit they have been very generous and kind. But eating out costs time and money and they are so many good choices in the valley.  The last straw was on Super Bowl sunday when we visited for the Super Bowl buffet. This event was advertised on their facebook page and looked really cool. $10 for all you can eat buffet featuring Pizza, Mac and Cheese, and wings. Sadly reality was anything but supper. The food was on a table that could have served as a sowing table in your house. It was short! Two things of Mac and Cheese were out, a long with one pizza. The place was packed, and there was hardly any food out at any point in time.  We ended up ordering off the regular menu. The owner was nice and said he did not expect anyone to actually come to the event, thus the lack of food. So why did you have the event if you did not expect people to come?   On a closing note, I want to point out again, the Owners and some of the staff where really nice. Maybe in the future I will give this place another try, hopefully some of the kinks will be worked out. I am looking forward to see if they can cook a burger Medium."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. They have a good selection of unique pizzas and of course you can create your own. Vegan and gluten free options available. I came here on a double date and we ordered the garlic monkey bread. That was really good and it came with marinara and a sour cream dill sauce I believe. I myself got the Happy Mac pizza. It was really good! I got a side of marinara though to put on top. My boyfriend got the Pig n Chick which is a BBQ pizza. He ate it all in the blink of an eye! My friends for the jalepeno Mac and the k-mac(Korean Mac), meatballs, and wings. I sampled everything of course haha and it was fantastic. I will definitely be back and they are open til 11pm every night."}
{"text":"I love the food, the atmosphere, the service and the location. I have been here several times and brought several friends and everyone has a good time. You must try the droopy fries"}
{"text":"Good food. Fair service. Wonderful location yet Outdoor seating is not wheelchair accessible.... Oops sorry people in wheelchairs. You cannot enjoy the al fresco dining... That's a turn off...."}
{"text":"This place is centrally located and I love it! It started out as a food truck and has kept that same down home type flavour.   I went with two other people and we each got a cocktail, they were all very good and refreshing. I had the kimchi one, I forget the name but it tasted kind of like a spicy Bloody Mary.  They had gluten free pizza for my allergic sister and she said the gluten free was awesome.   We shared slices and every pizza was to die for. Heavenly, if you are craving some home cooked tasting pizza with an excellent flavor combination, this is the place to go. It wasn't super busy but we did go on a weeknight.  The service was quick and friendly. The chairs were super comfy and the misters were misty."}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix and had the Hottie pizza.  It was really good, and it was fresh jalapeño not the jarred kind a lot of pizza places use.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great wings and the pizza is pretty good. I've had the Popeye and the Fun Guy and they were both good. The reason for three stars- the waiting. Both times I was here the food and water refills took FORVER. Definitely a nice atmosphere, very clean and friendly, but you need to devote some extra time to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.mmmmmm.Sitting on the patio!!!! I had visited the PPP under old ownership. The consistency of the old menu is there! Droopy fries: order, eat, repeat. Wine on tap. Yay! Super friendly wait staff! If you haven't tried it yet or tried it over again - you should!!!"}
{"text":"Never tried the food truck, but not impressed with the restaurant.  Bleu Mac had absolutely no bleu cheese flavor, might as well have been called \"mac and cheese.\"  Date Me was way overly salty.  Popeye was way overly garlicy.  After we were seated by the hostess, the woman who I can only assume is the manager approached our table and seemed generally annoyed that our party of 4 showed up on time for our reservation and then requested to sit at an open table on the patio.  She said something to the effect of, \"We weren't expecting you to sit here and now the kitchen is going to get all backed up.\"  Couldn't really understand why she even said anything to us at all.  Our waiter was nice and attentive though and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, so again not sure why the manager said anything, but she certainly set the tone for the meal..."}
{"text":"Hard to chose one thing!! We started with Mac n Cheese!!! Delicious!!!! BBQ Wings are so good, crispy!!! Oven baked and not greasy! We built our own pie, pepperoni and mushroom! Perfect crust and fresh tasting ingredients!!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at PPP.  The first time we had received excellent service from the bartender.  The 2nd time, we had just ordered food for takeout.  Today, we went in and the service was awful.  After ordering our food, my friend asked for ranch to go with the Drewpy Fries and after the server came back 15 minutes later to refill her drink, she had to ask for the ranch again.  He took the drink, promptly returned with the ranch.  Then came back again with the drink.  Where was the ranch?  Because we were on the patio.  The burger came out 20-25 minutes after the Drewpy Fries, so he obviously waited until we received the fries to order the burger.  We asked for medium and it was well done.  We asked for a field green salad and got Caesar.  We never received condiments other than what was on the plate.  He said he would come back to refill my water and never did.  We had to walk inside to ask for the bill and pay.    I still tipped 20% because for all I knew, this poor kid was by himself on the floor.  Maybe he was having a bad day.  Next time, I'll sit at the bar.  UPDATED*** About 30 minutes after we left there, we both had horrible stomach aches and my friend vomitted her food.  Maybe her reaction had to do with ranch that was sitting out by the door getting warm.  My stomach ache has subsided, but I feel sluggish and am probably going to leave work early."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. My boyfriend and I went for dinner and were recommended to get the Pub shrub as a drink. Glad we did! The hint of jalapeño in the drink is not overwhelming, and adds a unique flavor to a typical cocktail.   We started with the honey ginger soy wings, which we have already discussed how to recreate that flavor for our meals at home. That sauce paired with their dill ranch dressing they make creates an awesome combination. We got the truffle macaroni and cheese, which I knew I would love since I am a truffle fanatic.   Finally, we got their special pizza of the night. It was suppose to be sausage, pepperoni, and prosciutto but we think we got the wrong one cause we never saw any sausage. Anyway, it was pretty good, but nothing special. Pizza is almost always delicious and this was no exception but noteworthy."}
{"text":"No more chasing down the food truck!  Amazing restaurant layout. Perfect to book a party. The extended menu is genius. Ten different kinds of Mac n cheese?  Nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"I have been rooting for PPPs success. But the speed of the service and food delivery continues to decline.  If one of the owners is not present it's  super slow... very sad"}
{"text":"So glad that Pizza People is open!   The truffle mac n cheese with chicken is my favorite so far.   We can't get enough of the place so I feel confident we will have the entire menu sampled in no time.   Pricing is so reasonable and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Garlic Monkey Bread great perk for a yelp check in. Was yummy and came with a marinara sauce and a dill sauce. Yum. Also had the mac and cheese with bacon also very good. Others had a salad, pizza, calzone and burger it all looked great. Service was good water always refilled.  All in all a great first impression."}
{"text":"PPP is a pretty chill spot. They weren't very busy when I came in for dinner with a few friends. We were served almost right away so that's great. We actually had to move to a bigger table and the server was very accommodating.   I would have to say the pizza here is almost... homemade tasting which is a good step away from the usual pizza restaurants! They have pizza, salads, beer, appetizers, etc. We ordered the Date Me pizza and the Red, White, & Blue Salad. The Salad was spot on. It was delicious, a MUST try if you like fruit on your salad! The dressing wasn't too overpowering, which I usually have issues with when ordering salads at restaurants. The Date Me pizza was different. It was good, but not great. It did have a different kind of taste to it, so I would say to give it a try, especially if you like dates!  The actual setting of the restaurant is cool, they had TVs around the restaurant especially the bar where they were playing different sports on all. They have fun patio seating which I didn't get to try but will for sure next time! The whole area is somewhat of a \"San Fran\" feel but Phoenix-style. Service was really nice and the restrooms were clean - gotta love that!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this place. The interior was extremely nice, the staff friendly and attentive. The parmesian and corn Mac and cheese is the best. I think I'll be a regular. You need to try it."}
{"text":"Great Macaroni and Cheese! Unbelievable deals on Mimosas. Small but we'll conceived wine list. Staff is attentive and informed. Overall, it is a great experience...  #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Great place!  Wonderful staff, happy hr, Mac and cheese!  Pizza......not so much.  We got the \"Popeye\" basically a cracker with red sauce and wilted spinach.  Friends got \"Margherita\" just okay also.  Mac and cheese wonderful and priced right!"}
{"text":"What?!!!  I can now grab my favorite pizza any day of the week! Whoo hoo!!!  Seriously one of the best pizza pies in town.   I walked in knowing exactly what I wanted, but I am always up for trying more, and so happy I did! My meal included two Mac n Cheeses, the Mushroom and the Jalepeno with bacon (I always add bacon, it  makes everything better;) haha!), both were creamy and flavorful, I highly recommend them! My signature pizza, The Testosteroni, perfect as always with a crispy delicious crust. Spud Fingers which were a nice surprise, as I'm not always a huge fan of fingerling potatoes, but they were awesome and the ranch/dill dipping sauce was a great touch! And finally, the Jalepeno Poppers, mmmm. That's all:)    Proud to say, I finished everything! Yep, this girl knows how to eat:D!! On top of the delicious food, they have created a great environment with booths, couches, bar seating and tv's if your watching a game!  Awesome spot, tasty food, super nice staff! You must go!  I will be back......A Lot! :D"}
{"text":"Great place! First time. Just happen to be in the neighborhood. The bartender made a great spicy margarita for me. I ordered the Jamaica jerk wings. Absolutely love em!!!! I will definitely be back with my boyfriend and friends.  Everyone was so friendly. Nice job. I'm in the business and never leave reviews. But this place deserves recognition."}
{"text":"Love this place so glad it's open again. Best mac and cheese and love to monkey garlic bread! Pizza is good too. Knocking a star off because the new owners reopened this place which is amazing, and they re-did the bar, but...there's only 3 TVs?! Football season is upon us, would be nice if people had this as a place to go watch the games and it would help business and hopefully keep this place open for good this time."}
{"text":"This place has got to be one of my favorite spots in all of Phoenix. The atmosphere is welcoming, chill, hip, and laid back, the good is delicious and the menu options are plenty!  We had wine at our visit and it was great, did not try their cocktails but the bar seemed happening and awesome.  I tried the mushroom mac and my friend tried the jalapeño mac, both were outstanding.  For my main course, I had the Hulk pizza and my friend had a burger, both very tasty.  Again, atmosphere alone makes up for this location, and I will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Um, please build a Dallas restaurant. We spent our last day of vacation killing time in and around Phoenix and found this place after doing some shopping downtown. The pizza, yum. The mac and cheese, yum. The monkey bread, yum. We were lucky to be there on a Tuesday, which includes all kinds of $5 specials. When you order a beer, you get a little personal pitcher. They don't mess around. Great people watching from the patio as the train station is right across the street. Beautiful buildings nearby as well, since it is an art district. The service was wonderful, no complaints."}
{"text":"Truthfully even though they are a pizza place (see it's name), I come for the salads and the mac and cheese offerings.  They have a kimchee based sauce that is unlike any other available in town.  You can get it as a wingsauce or as a mac and cheese.  Get it, prepare for your eyes to roll back in ecstasy and rejoice.  The mac and cheese offerings come in individual servings so order a few.  The pizza's are the thin, chewy ones with a little char.  The sauce is a little sweeter than at La Piazza Locale which I actually prefer.  It is right on the light rail, the interior no longer reminds me of Cheauvront (although I miss that place terribly).  Good cocktails, decent wines.  Great HH, plus being on the light rail makes this an easy hop for a stop before a show, or for a light rail crawl, or if you just want to people watch."}
{"text":"Great variety. We love their pizzas and the mac and cheese is a good change. Order the jalapeño canoes as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Weezer - Buddy Holly)  What's with this pizza tasting so good? They don't gotta front What did we ever do to deserve this That made them so delicious?  Hoo, hoo But you know I'm yours Hoo, hoo And I know you're mine Hoo, hoo And that's for all of time  Oh Bo Bites, Let's go to Pizza People Pub... Oh, oh, and order meatballs I want more! I Bo Bites what I want to say about it anyway I Bo Bites about that!  Great service great people great food!  Overall Pizza People Pub made my night much better!  I came on an off night so it was pretty chill spot.  The place is built right under some condos; lucky bastards!  With a U shape bar and TV screens all around this makes for a great sporting event place.  As I ordered my drink the bartender introduced me to a new whiskey since that was my choice of beverage tonight.  He offered me a sample; which was awesome, but I thought it was too smooth for my concoction.  Maybe next time.  My friend and I proceeded to order the pizza and meatball appetizer.  The meatball was layered with some marinara and topped with some garnishments.  Overall, very homemade tasting and darn great start to my palates.  The star of the night came when we went with The Hottie; a thin crust pizza with mozzarella, Italian sausage, jalapenos, serrano peppers, green chile, and basils;  when they say hot oh boy they meant hot!  Not a lot of places I know will put some banging hotness to my liking, but PPP popped me with a good Right!    In the end, definite spot for me to return if I'm back in the central area again! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rude!  I have never been treated with such disrespect.  My husband and I called in an order - we were thinking of doing a retirement lunch for work and wanted to try it first.  We showed up to get our order & the place was pretty dead - not many people there at all as I eat pretty early.  We were told to go stand up by the bar which we did.  We were told they don't know if our order is ready or not.  We waited a while (while employees kept bumping into us). Finally someone gave us our bill - still no order.  We gave a credit card & set it on the bar.  We waited & waited & waited.  No one ever came back to get the credit card, no one came to tell us if our order was ready or still cooking, employees continued to bump into us.  I got tired of waiting, picked up the credit card and left without food.  Can't comment to the food as unfortunately they did not feel the need to get a new customer.  We ended up doing Red Devil for our work retirement party at the school we work at."}
{"text":"The AZ Jackass Mule was amazing great but the old fashioned was not very good. We had two pizzas (the Testoseroni & the Date... something) , and the red white and blue salad. We would ordered both again! The patio was perfect for dining with our kids and the inside had a relaxed yet chic atmosphere. We'll definitely be back! Thanks for taking great care of us, Jake (our server)!"}
{"text":"Service and food were both incredible. I loved the fries! My only complaint was the Bloody Mary mix. I like that it's homemade but I didn't like that it tasted like spaghetti-o's. The tomato juice needs to be cut with some more citrus or something."}
{"text":"Pizza -fell way below expectations in flavor, especially priced at $12.00+ for 10\" you'd also expect much more.   Burger- save yourself the $10+, this also fell short of even decent. Thick, bland, aged tasting beef patty, with a single tomato slice thicker than the patty itself..    Buffalo wings- you'll remember how un memorable these are. So pass. .   Service - we arrived at 10:10PM (they close at 11) and already out server seemed so uninterested, even after telling him this was our first visit.  This basically did it for me,  and won't be returning, especially with many better pizza/burger/ bar places near.   One star only because it is a nice comfortable place to have a drink and pass a nice time.   One last thing, the men's restroom is awkwardly small and is supposed to be for double. . Save yourself that awkward moment, and lock the door, pee alone."}
{"text":"Tried this place late on a Wednesday night and it was awesome! Great service from the manager (he was our server) and loved the decor and feel for the place. We requested to sit at a table with high winged back chairs and they were so comfy.   My friend got a 32oz pitcher of beer and I got a carafe of wine (both a great deal.) we ordered The Hulk pizza (YUM) and each had a side of their famous Mac and Cheese! I had the Bleu Mac and added bacon and thought I'd died and gone to heaven! Delish! My friend had the Jalapeño Mac and it was great too.  We were excited to see they serve breakfast on weekends so we will be back for that too!!   Must try in my opinion!!!"}
{"text":"First visit to PPP stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Cute place! The décor is adorable and they have really comfy looking chairs and booths. We sat at a high top near the windows overlooking the patio which looks awesome! Will have to come back and check that out next time!   Ordered BBQ buffalo wings, pepperoni pizza and mozzarella salad. The salad was fantastic! The wings were cooked to perfection and the sauce was awesome! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Let me think... How do o say this.... I am basically OBSESSED w this place. Every single time I have been here I've never left anything but happy and full! Service is great, food is fresh and delicious and the drinks are always cold!   Must try: the hottie pizza (I add arugula)  Truffle Mac n cheese.. soooooooo good    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So glad to see this place reopen.  Same great food and a lot of the original staff.  Great place for a quick meal or a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Have you seen the SNL sketch where they are out to dinner and order the chocolate cake and everyone starts beating the crap out of each other because it's that good?  That was pretty much my reaction when I had pizza people pubs truffle Mac n cheese. I had the hardest time choosing a mac n cheese from their wide selection, but I know in the end I chose right. I made all my co workers try a bite and they all agreed it was THE BEST!   Thanks Pizza People Pub for the best bday lunch eva!"}
{"text":"My husband and attended our friends art show downtown and were hungry when it was over. This is the  only place we could find open at that time. The restaurant is trendy and the service was good. We tried the korean wings, which were great. However, the pizza we tried wasn't anything special. Maybe we should have tried a different pizza. Overall this place was ok."}
{"text":"atmosphere is kind of pub like, a little dark, music is a little loud. the chairs are high back wing style and not comfortable. too low for the table. it has a nice lounge area with two couches and a row of chairs. there's a tv at the bar which is showing a baseball game. they serve \"old style\" beer which is nice.  the place was pretty empty and our food still isn't here after about 20 ish minutes. food here now. burger is good. probably a 1/3 lb. the coleslaw is very vinegar-y.  the dill ranch sauce is good."}
{"text":"My nephew took me to dinner on Saturday night, which was a treat to begin with.  This is a great place, with ample parking for being right on Central downtown.  The vibe was awesome, we sat towards the back and although there were people all around us, it was like we were dining by ourselves.  The waitress was fantastic and although she had only been there 3 weeks, she got answers to all or our questions even when she wasn't sure, she asked.   We had 2 different kinds of wings, Buffalo and Jamaicain, both were delicious and a little spicy.  We also had the mini sausages in a puff pastry that came with Ranch dressing and a Honey Mustard Vinaigrette that was to die for.  Both were starters and came with not only carrots and celery but also large slices of cucumber and zucchini, a very nice touch.  We also ordered a pizza, The Manny, and it was amazing!  It had Pepperoni, Bacon, onion, jalapeno cream cheese, red chili flakes and slices of avocado.  It was amazing, cooked just right.  Will definitely be coming back as there are several other great looking things on the menu."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restuarants in Phoenix.. along with Switch and Fez this is owned by the same people.  The food was fabulous and the service was great.  Tom one of the owners is an awesome guy.  Will definately go back again and again."}
{"text":"Their food was ok but nothing really stood out other than their ranch dressing which accompanied the bread balls."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!  The date me pizza was Fantastic I got my half without meat and cheese and it rocked!  The pesto hummus appetizer was amazing as well and a huge! It was shareable with our table of 4!  Our server was extremely helpful and attentive I wish I remembered his name! I do know he is vegan and helped me order a fabulous pizza. Btw They have Trivia you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday weekend and I was having a get together with friends and family, and I had originally planned on having the dinner at another local restaurant but few days before the dinner the manger called and said they could not host us unless we sat outside, and well its Phoenix & August so that's not going to work.  So I asked some friends and did some research and called Pizza People Pub on a Wednesday to see if they could host a party of 26 on Saturday at 6pm and without any hesitation they said yes, the hostess asked what's the occasion told her it was to celebrate my birthday, was given 2 rules, no glitter no confetti, damn it was like she knew me already haha.  26 people, plenty of tables and one great server! I wish I remembered his name, he was able to handle the entire party with ease, and everyone had nothing but positive things to say about the service! He didn't even blink an eye when asked if separate checks were ok, he said no problem! Just excellent.  I started off with the drink of the day, which was the huckleberry punch, not sure of what all was in it, but it was a great drink for 4 bucks.  For food, I went with the BBQ Pig N Chick, BBQ sauce, mozzarella, chicken, BACON, onions and fresh cilantro, this was a delish pizza! The crust was perfect, it had an even amount of sauce and plenty of toppings. And even with being a big party, everyone received their meals in a timely matter.  I was happy with everything Pizza People Pub provided, I now know a cool spot to have for small or large dinner parties!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, people, and plenty choices of Mac and Cheese!!!  What can I say?  Great food & service!  Had the same thing again:  Testostroni pizza and Bacon Mac & Cheese... BACON!"}
{"text":"So the awesome food truck came to a fixed abode at the old Cheuvront location.  I am in heaven - No longer have to wander around the Valley trying to remember what days/times they're supposed to be where.  And it's only a few blocks from home.  Thank you downtown Phoenix and especially thank you Pizza People Pub!"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for the first time. Its conveniently located close to a light rail stop. The place is super cute, they have amazing art on the walls. The staff was friendly. The food was good. We started with monkey bread. That was awesome! I built my own pizza. So that was great. They have veggie friendly dishes along with gluten free. My friend had the mac n cheese with ground beef. That wasn't as good as it sounded. I also got free desert for my bday! So overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great service and pies were super tasty! The standard pepperoni was fresh with melty cheese. Pies are thin which is perfect, less dough equals more topping flavor a. the \"Hulk\" and the Hawaiian were also very tasteful!"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite pizza place in Arizona!!! Haven't been to the Pub yet but it's on my to-do list in the very near future! I love pizza and am sooo glad to have a new place to get it. At Taste of the Trucks I was able to try a few kinds. The Hulk is unbelievable!!! Not very greasy for pizza Bd the crust is thin and perfectly cooked! Can't wait to try more!!!"}
{"text":"Not my first time here but first time writing a review. Staff was very accommodating and polite. I went with the Fun Guy pizza this time and the white parm and corn mac and cheese. Both were really good. They easily have the best mac and cheese I've ever had hands down."}
{"text":"Stopped here after first friday at the art museum.  Best mac & cheese EVER!!  The garlic monkey bread...yum!  My friends said the Date Me pizza was very good.  I cannot wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Great people, great food, great service and atmosphere!! I've had pizzas, salads, burgers, apps and brunch there and was happy every time!! And I'm kinda hard to please:)"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The ambience of the place is so fun and relaxing, it couldn't get any better. The huge back winged chairs made me feel like royalty and the service did as well. The service was super friendly. As it was my first time there, the server took some time to go over some menu items which I appreciated.   As far as the food....the pizza is really great! And the mac and cheese is heavenly. I've made plans to go back and continue going until I've tried all the variations of mac n cheese! I cant wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! A friend and I headed over after work the other day just in time for happy hour! (The pear cider was delicious and a dollar off!) Our server was extremely sweet and attentive, and she made great recommendations. The highlight was definitely the spuds and the home-made ranch! So happy that this place is right across the street from my job- I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and since I live nearby, I rode my bike down here for lunch with a friend but didn't bring my lock.  The hostess was nice enough to allow the bikes to sit by the door where I could watch them. We got seated right away and it wasn't as crowded as I expected for an 1130am work day.  I got the Kauai Hawaiian pizza which was a little soggy. The ham/cheese was sliding off on but the mac n cheese was good.  My friend said her Popeye pizza was good. Our waitress was very attentive.  Since I love pizza, I'll probably go back to try the other ones and the gluten free one. There is quite a few pizza restaurants around the area that is a bar above this one."}
{"text":"Best Mac & Cheese in town yum yum yum.  Do not order cheesecake for dessert unless you like fluffy Cool whip type cheesecake. Do not rely on your waitress to know how to properly describe the food."}
{"text":"Really like Pizza Pub pizza. That's a mouthful in itself! We've decided it's the best pizza in Phoenix due to how well it holds up. No sagging crust and delicious fresh toppings. The monkey bread is great too. On a recent visit with friends we shared the meat one along with the BBQ chicken one. All of us agreed it was well worth it and as someone who doesn't like BBQ I even enjoyed it. Great warm interior and welcoming patio. Parking can be a problem but worth the expense"}
{"text":"Love them in the food truck...pub, not so much. Went two times. My kid and husband both RAVE about the mac and cheese, but since I'm not a cheese fan, I haven't had it. I've only eaten the pizza and I have not been impressed.  Last time, I ordered the vegan Mexican pizza. It was so bland and tasteless that I asked for hot sauce to douse it in. The server said they had none...so it went back to the kitchen because I'm not a fan of eating cardboard. He still charged us for it. I paid $10 for a bite of a terrible pizza. I won't be back!  Also, fyi, if you sit in the main bar area near a speaker, prepare to lose some of your hearing. They blast the music."}
{"text":"Went to Pizza People Pub the other night for dinner, hoping to get some more of the awesome pizza I'd had from their truck back in May.  The pizza was wonderful as I remembered, and I also tried the Spud Fingers app (good seasoning, though the potatoes could stand to be cooked longer), and the Peach Cobbler for dessert. Get the peach cobbler! It's so good, served warm with a crunchy-topped biscuit topping and vanilla ice cream.  I can't wait to go back and try some other items on their menu, as well as more of that tasty pizza! You can read more about my dinner there on my blog, ovenandapron.com."}
{"text":"Ive heard a lot about PPP and their food. My bf was craving pizza, and I was craving Mac and cheese, and so it was the perfect time to try something new!   I was so intrigued by all the Mac and cheeses, that I couldn't get just one! I got a mushroom Mac with bacon and a Korean spicy Mac. The Korean spicy Mac was interesting with a good level of heat (just enough to taste, but not enough to burn or overpower). Nothing special, but the novelty made it worth it. Unfortunately, the mushroom Mac was bad news bears. Waaaaay too salty (I think it was the bacon); I was pretty disappointed.  The carrots on the side were dry and inedibly warm (but that's probably because it was takeout. I  don't fault PPP for this).  On the bright side, parking was easy peasy. Also, my s/o's bbq pig n' chick and the BBQ wings were delicious and perfectly crispy."}
{"text":"Their Mac n cheese is out of this world!!!! Staff is easygoing and friendly too. I love the homemade key lime pie. Also try the Manny Pie and the Fun Guy. Amazing. If you're a beer drinker, the custom pale is awesome. Wine? Try the wine of the moment, or there's a great Zin they carry, as well as the wild hare petite Syrah.   If you're looking for a casual place with good vibes, look no further!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Friendly service. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We got a Sara pizza and a sausage pizza. Both were delicious. Our table also got the regular Mac and cheese, buffalo Mac and cheese, truffle Mac and cheese and mushroom Mac. They were all fabulous. 8 ounces was very filling and we left with plenty of leftovers. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I live in downtown Phoenix and enjoy going to the pizzerias in my neighborhood to sniff out the best pizza in the downtown area. Out of the multiple pizzerias I've had pizza from, this is my least favorite restaurant. Margherita pizza is typically my go to pizza and the Margherita pizza at PPP was nothing to write home about. The sauce was bland and tasted like plain tomato sauce. The crust of the pizza was much the same. It was disappointing to pay $10 for a pizza that would've lost a \"pie-off\" to a frozen pizza.   The service at the restaurant was terrible. I went on a Sunday night to order a to go pie and waited at least five minutes at the bar without any type of greeting. When the bartender did ask what I needed, he was short with his tone, much unlike his tone with the other customers across the bar who received a friendly farewell as they left. A different server ended up bringing out my pie from the kitchen rather than the bartender who took my very simple order. It was a Sunday night, not busy so I would expect better customer service.   When it comes to downtown pizza eateries, I'll stick to Pomo pizza where the service is as impeccable as the food. Pizza People Pub, you lost my vote."}
{"text":"When a mutual craving for pizza made us decide to give this spot a shot, I did not realize I was about to set Waze to take me to the location of an old haunt.       Having dined here previously during the Cheuvrant era, and taking my (now) wife on one of our very first dates there, the memories came flooding back when we pulled into the Pizza People Pub parking lot.  PPP is, of course, an entirely different concept with an entirely different owner.   And it definitely impressed.   The ambiance is great -- laid back yet trendy.   Great bar, great menu too.  Despite my tip that they have mac & cheese pizza (!!!!???!!!?!?!?!?!), I did not try it -- after leaving the tip, my eyes drew me to the Manny.   Red Sauce, Jalapeño Cream Cheese, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Bacon, Red Onion, Chili Flakes and Fresh Avocado?  Sign me up.  My wife traded me a slice of her Fun Guy (sans arugula, add prosciutto).  While I liked the Manny better, both pies were very tasty!  Further, I desire crispiness in my pizza crust.  Soggy crust just does not slice it for me.  I'm not talking about brick hard here, just a bit of crisp to the bite.  To my pleasure, I immediately noted that our pizzas both delivered on that!    Great pizzas all around.    The selection of 10\" pizzas, burgers & sandwiches, apps (including wings), mac & cheeses and, salads provides something desirable for nearly anyone with a mouth, taste buds and a stomach.  They also have weekend brunch, which I look forward to trying.     In researching PPP, I also discovered that the business began life as a food truck.    The owners were clearly successful in that venture, and parlayed that success into a full blown retail location. Kudos to them, because they've done a great job.     This first visit impressed, and I am frankly drooling over most everything on their menu, so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Saturday evening during spring break and sat on the patio. There's twinkle lights hanging outside and heaters for chilly evenings. The service was quick, especially for 3 pizzas. The waiter was super friendly and the pizza was delicious! I would come back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This places ceases to amaze me. Their service, ambiance and food is above average and worth the visit. Complete whole packet! Most importantly, they care first about their customer, the community, and our Phoenix peeps! They have continually bent over backward to accommodate every size of party and their service and food is spot on. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place gives Taco Tuesdays a run for their money with their baller Tuesday deals! Plus, their pizzas are always legit amazing. There's something for everyone. Plus, the lush leather chairs as you enter are inviting. It's like a pub out of a very good dream!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently with the family and my brother and sister-in-law.  The food was good, but overall pretty average.  The kids had the Korean flavored wings - though I did steal one from them - the sauce was overly dense and sweet.  Also ordered the garlic monkey bread for appetizers and it was pretty good.  I had the \"Date Me\" pizza and my wife and brother had the \"Fun Guy\" pizza.  Their's were much better.  While I enjoyed my pizza, I couldn't finish it.  While I knew that dates would make the pizza sweeter, it just got to be overwhelming after about half the pizza.  My SIL ordered the truffle mac and cheese.  It was good, but she noted the truffle oil was a bit heavy and did not finish her portion (this despite each person, 4, took a spoonful to try).  While our waiter was very friendly and nice, the food took a very long time.  This was nearly a 2.5 hour lunch...not because we're slow eaters, but because the food came out very, very slowly.  The appetizers took a good 45 minutes before we got them.  The pizza took another hour.  Then after the lengthy wait, they got my wife's pizza wrong - another 30 minutes before she could eat her pizza after being told, \"we'll get that fixed right away!\".  While the waiter acknowledged that he entered the wrong pizza despite writing it correctly, he didn't comp us for the wrong order.  Overall, slightly above average food.  Super long wait for foods...definitely not a first choice next time."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The bf and I went there last week on a Wednesday, so it wasn't very crowded. Nice hip vibe with cool local artwork on the walls. I like the bar with the neon changing lights. But it's not too hipster -- it's approachable, and there were plenty of average people there like myself. Service was great.  We ordered the eggplant dip that came with pita bread (so good) and veggies. It was super fresh and we devoured it. We also ordered the Popeye pizza -- again, very fresh ingredients. I had the Blue Biggie Mac. It came out in its own little silver dish with handles which was adorable. We boxed up our leftovers for lunch the next day and ordered dessert: peach bread pudding with a salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. Oh my, was it delectable. We will certainly be returning!! The prices are decent considering the quality of the ingredients. I really want to try one of their cocktails next time."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in phx. Period. Never go wrong here! This place has a great ambiance and the food will put you in a daze of amazement. Cannot go wrong here! A must go in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, went with a group of friends. My husband and I split their Testosteroni and it was the perfect size for two. Get a side of ranch with your pizza, they make it themselves and it's super good! Service was friendly and they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Pizza people is a nice mom and pop place in the art district. We went on a Tuesday night and it was trivia witch was a nice thing to walk into, as well as 15 minutes before happy hour ended. They have some nice pizza, wings, and Mac and cheese on the happy hour menu. Pizza was a little burnt when looking at it but still tasted fairly well. And I'm from NY and I like to think I know good pizza and this one was not half bad. The wings had a good spice to them but the ranch I was not a fan of. I appreciate that they make it in house from scratch but was way to much dill and just didn't resemble a ranch. The regular Mac and cheese was very nice in flavor and look. A nice serving but pasta was a little too over cooked. We also got the buff Mac witch was too hot for me. Oh btw if you check in on he yelp app you get a free monkey bread app, it garlic bread basically and very good! All in all this is a nice Cozy place with art displayed on the wall and clean bathrooms. Our waiter was very good I wish I remembered his name. I always forget the waiters name. I do recommend this place for quick bite to eat and doesn't hurt the wallet! Enjoy"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch before heading to the airport and were not disappointed. We used the offer on yelp for free garlic monkey bread, which was a great starter and came with two sauces. We then shared the Sara pizza, which was unique and super good. The servers were friendly and the service was generally good. They had good vegetarian pizza options."}
{"text":"I love Pizza People Pub. I haven't had the chance to come back here in a while so when I suggested it to a friend, she saw pictures of the mac and cheese and was sold. It brought back memories of working downtown and a comforting wave of nostalgia came over me. It's got a great location being next to the light rail and across from the library, whenever it opens up again.  I knew I had to get some of my old favorites since the folks who bought the place kept the original menu. I started with an order of their monkey bread, free with your checkin. We decided to split the large willow grove salad and each get a mac mini. We both went with the jalapeño flavor and were not disappointed. Our server, Anthony, was fantastic and so friendly. The monkey bread came out first with marinara sauce and a dill ranch dip, which was intriguing. Wish the marinara was thicker because I spilled some of the liquid sauce on myself, but that's partly my fault. The bread balls were tasty and a good starter. The salad was as I remembered, a solid blend of flavors from the goat cheese, dates, olives, oranges, pecans and greens. Love that they had the agave vinaigrette on the side without us even asking.   For the main course, our mac and cheese came out nice and hot and we were advised to wait a bit before digging in. It was as creamy as I remembered, and very cheesy, also on the salty side but I prefer that. The jalapeños add a nice kick but not too spicy. I've tried a few other flavors and this is the one I've liked best so far.  I'm so happy PPP is back in business and doing well and I hope to be back soon. Can't forget about my beloved Date Me Pizza! Any place that uses dates in their dishes is a friend of mine."}
{"text":"Kimchi pizza....please bring it back....please....chicken wings and salad are also good."}
{"text":"It's surprising the I've found myself writing a review about Mac N Cheese, but here I am! I've been here a few different times and have always been blown away by the different Mac N Cheese creations. The service is very so-so but it's a nice place to go out with friends."}
{"text":"Food was great however the service was poor. There were so many people coming to our table, we still have no idea who our actual server was. My biggest concern was that when I ordered a gluten-free crust, the girl that took our order never communicated that to the kitchen so I was brought a regular crust. Luckily the thick crust was a dead giveaway to the crust NOT being gluten-free and was able to catch it before ingesting. There was a woman who I'm assuming was the manager who was very gracious and made sure to take care of the issue (and very quickly). Not impresses with the waitstaff... At all! LOVE the wide variety of gluten-free substitutions on the menu!"}
{"text":"great pizza good crust very chewy i loves it. definitely going back. good prices and food was very tasty"}
{"text":"Came down to check the place out and watch the Cardinals game. Well decorated, staff is friendly, and the tvs are well situated around the bar. There is nothing over ten bucks on the menu (sans the large order of wings10.95) and all the items came out relatively fast for how any people were in the place. Great job on the transition from truck to bricks!"}
{"text":"Really good speciality drink, great mac n' cheese in a variety of flavors and good homemade meatballs = $15.  Decent prices for sure....and great service.  I am coming back next time with a group of friends soon. Parking is on the east side of the restaurant so drive slowly when you get close to it--and look for the driveway.  I missed it, and went around the block two times but, now that I know it's there, it's easy to find. This is a great, new places to try."}
{"text":"I dined at Pizza People Pub several years ago, but decided to pay them a second visit to help jog my memory. The original owners had planned to close down, but PPP was purchased by new owners and continues operating in Central Phoenix.  The restaurant is located below the absurdly overpriced Artisan Lofts. Thankfully, unlike most restaurants in this area, there's actually parking. Keeping with the positive, this restaurant has a very nice environment. I particularly like the big leather chairs.  The place was active, although not as busy as one would assume for a Saturday night. Over time, the dining scene in this area has increased dramatically both in quality and in quantity, so I'm glad to see this place is able to survive.  As for the food, it's fine - just as I remember. The numerous mac and cheese options is a neat concept. Their burgers are very big, but my girlfriend was a bit disappointed in the flavor of the meat. Other nearby burger joints have spoiled us both in this regard. In terms of their pizza, the ingredients are all good enough, although their crust has more of a spongy texture that has never really been my ideal preference. But it does indeed have flavor, so I can't knock it too hard.   If you check in on Yelp, you'll get a free order of garlic monkey bread. A nice little starter, even if the garlic and butter is a bit overwhelming as a few other people have noticed. It's free - so who cares?  In the end, PPP is a cool little spot for a quick bite or drink. While their food doesn't particularly stand out as anything spectacular, I think it's good enough to where they're worth the occasional visit in the future.  Recommended to check out."}
{"text":"Food was ok but for the prices, I would expect better.  The burgers we're overdone, was not a fan of the fries with just a flash fry (raw).  The Grande pub shrub drink was was bad.  Hardly ever not finish a drink, but that drink, I could not force myself to finish it."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back here. We stopped for lunch on the weekend and I saw they had a brunch menu, for sure I want to check that out. The food was amazing. We had a little bit of everything. The fries were the bomb! We also had a pizza and our daughter loved the pigs in the blanket. It was very fun and hipster!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out here because it was a shorter walk than going to my normal pizza spot CIBO. I looked at the menu online and saw a ton of things I was interested in. Based off of some yelp pictures I decided to get the mac&cheese pizza without beef since I don't eat meat. It was interesting....I wish the pizza was a little bigger...when I saw it I decided to order a side of the potato fingers. They were good but I wouldn't order that side again. I will probably go back...the pizza was good and the drink menu looked interesting as well."}
{"text":"Now this is going to be weird but I don't like the pizza but there is a saving grace and big tasty one which is their  Mac and Cheese. 4.25 for small one and 9.50 for big one but let's be real you will want some meat added which is 1 dollar for small and 1.95 for a big one. But it is worth it really tasty and alot of options . once again their pizza is just not for me it is really not my cup of tea kind of like flat bread and cheese. I would give their pizza a 1 if it is was based on just that but the Mac and Cheese is so dang good. The place is nice to sit down and have a beer also the prices are pretty average for drinks but their are really cheaper options for drinks. Once again the Mac and cheese worth it ."}
{"text":"This isn't the best pizza downtown by any means, but it's still pretty damn good and also cheaper than other pizza joints of similar caliber. They offer a great selection of pizzas (and other food that i haven't tried because I come here for pizza dammit), and decently priced beers! The Pub also offers a nice cozy spot on Central that's great for people watching and just chilling out. I dig it. I've been several times, and I plan on many more visits in the future. So far my favorite pie is the Funguy and if you're really into spicy pizza, the Hottie is pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here recently for a late opening special andf walked away with a mug that allows us $4 drafts AND a $5 coupon.  Pretty cool.    This location features specialty pizzas, salads, wine, beer.  Because we were there for an opening celebration, we were able to taste a variety of things.    Now I know at a pizza joint to say that you loved the salad is kinda sacreligious, but I'm confident in my statement. I loved the salad I ordered!  The salads are massive, so be forewarned; but my MB Chop was hearty, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Friends split the P3 salad which looked just as delicious as mine.   WE were able to sample the mac n cheese and as a former Georgia and North Carolina resident, it just wasn't up to my standards. But my local friends, who don't know any better, loved it. ;)     The pizza is higher quality than your average take out, for sure.  We opted for the Date Me pizza and the combination of the dates, goat cheese, prosciutto, and argula offered both sweetness and savory flavors with a light crispy crust.  Delicious.  The atmosophere is laid back with music in the background and a slightly industrial feel.   If you're in the area and/or looking for a pizza night that is out of the norm, this is defnitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. The Happy Hour isn't much, $1 off drinks, so if it was better then this could jump to a 5 star. The place is big and looks good. We had drinks; loved the cold copper mugs for the Moscow Mules. The monkey break appetizer was great as were the 2 pizzas and mac and cheese we ordered. The Testosteroni and the Popeye pizzas were both excellent and we got the cheese and corn mac and cheese that everyone was raving about on Yelp and that was a phenomenal choice. I thought with 4 of us we would have leftovers, but no dice. This stuff was so could we couldn't stop eating!  It's right next to the Old Spaghetti Factory and kind of hard to see except they had a sign sitting at the street for where to turn, which was helpful."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza. I have had their salads and Mac and cheese and both were tasty too. Definitely come here for the pizza.  The owner is always around and very nice. They also host random events with different companies. Once we happen to be there and got the chance to sample mead."}
{"text":"Located just across the street from the Burton Barr Library. Parking lot.   For those with little ones, Child high chairs, and handicap access restroom has a little dresser that can be used as a changing table."}
{"text":"Least favorite pizza in the area.  It is at a lower price point though so that should be expected.  Pizza and wings just above average.  Surprised by the higher ratings."}
{"text":"We came here for Amy's lunch time UYE, uh like forever ago. I just suck at staying up to date with my reviews. I have to say that I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. So I was pleasantly surprised with the opening week lunch $5 specials that were actually really tasty. I was in love with the enormous salad and pizza each for only $5. Unfortunately it has been so long ago that I don't even remember what they were. I really need to get back there and have something else. That way I can update my review with some spicy details. Yeah that would be better than just saying it was good. Hehe! So aside from the food itself the waitress was really great accommodating us quickly for our large lunch group. The only thing I didn't like about the experience was the music. It was garbage Kesha or something of the like. Note to self: bring them better music...   Gotta get back here soon!"}
{"text":"I want to love this local place for brunch, but we waited 45 minutes for our meal which was undercooked pizza dough under a smattering of smoked salmon and wilted lettuce on top of frittata.  We were the only people in the restaurant.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have never had a poor experience here and have enjoyed myself ever time.  I ADORE the local art and the food is fab.  The lounge area is cozy and the dining area is great (but they are mostly high tops).  The beer selection is not bad, and the only negative I can drum up is that I wish it was bigger.  But they truly make the most of the small space, so I'm happy.  I have been twice and would not hesitate to return. :)"}
{"text":"Had to give these guys five stars. Three families all decided to take our hungry kids to a Christmas event at the Irish Cultural Center in the same night that the Electric Light Parade took place. Guess what? Kids are not excited about hand-held meat pie. So we called ahead to let Pizza People know we were coming with a group of 10, with 5 kids under 11. They took our order by phone, and when we got there the table, with drinks, was ready. The food showed up within 5 minutes! The server checked on us regularly and got us out as soon as we were ready, which anyone dining with little kids knows is a priority. This was all while the Pizza People staff was preping and serving a party of over 100  who had been in the parade (Side note: the party all showed up in Christmas gear and it made the night even more special) .  The adults even got to try some new beers and waaaay better than average pizza! The Testosteronni and Date Me are both winners, and the kiddos polished off 3 pepperoni pizzas. Pizza People saved our night.  If you're thinking about pizza I'd skip Bianco and head over to Pizza People."}
{"text":"Pizzas are delicious! Mac and cheeses are delicious. Love love love the blue cheese mac!!! Only wish this place was closer to our house!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm.  Not too busy and we sat at the bar.  Decent beer selection and the menu is tasty.  Love the variety of seating selections...high tops, comfortable booths, couches, a dart board...good patio outside with torches...pretty much has it all.   Decor is modern.   By the time we left at 9pm, it was getting busy!  Great addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Pizza People has drink specials all day EVERYDAY (my bf and I tend to frequent on Fridays for the $4 Jack Daniels special)   I've always had a great experience here. There is bike parking nearby and a dog friendly patio stocked with water bowls for your pooch. It's also a good spot to catch a game and grab a quick bite.   It's not my favorite pizza place in the Valley, but they have so much more to offer than just pizza. Get the monkey bread!  The staff is consistently friendly and attentive, and I never have to wait to be seated here, a huge plus for the location.   Keep doing what you're doing Pizza People."}
{"text":"I am so mad at myself for not writing a review sooner for this place!  Ummmm amazing place! They have a great atmosphere and the employees are awesome. Very friendly and fun place to go for pizza and beer.  They have different specials every day so you can't go wrong with that! I go mostly for their pizza, beer and there AWESOME Mac and cheese. I think they have some award for it? If not, they should.  I don't know how to explain the pizza but it just shows off all the flavors with any kind you get. Mmmmm. It's fresh and flavorful!  If you are craving pizza come try this place out!"}
{"text":"I thought I had written a review of this place but I guess this is indeed, my first review. I went here a few months ago and then last Sunday with friends after a visit to a new exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum (same light rail stop for both).   The establishment was as good or better than last time. The house beer was a nice ale and then I and others tried some items from the cocktail list and they were quite good. I don't know what it is about seeing art and culture at the museum but nothing seems more appropriate afterwards than some nice mixed drinks and a discussion with friends.  Besides Pizza the Mac-N-Cheese variations seem especially good and the salads look wonderfully fresh. In addition, the staff is pleasant and willing to make recommendations. They do have a Korean pizza  that looks interesting and some day I will try it.  I'll be honest, I think the 5th star is very much related to the ease of the location (right off the rail) and the proximity to the museum. Oh, and if someone is gluten intolerant (as one of friends who came to the museum with me) they do have gluten free pizza crusts and burger buns, so everyone can enjoy the meal.   If I could make one recommendation, have a short list of classic cocktails, such as a standard old fashioned (they have a variation of it but the standard one is great as well)  . The yearly cocktail week event in Phoenix is a good place to get ideas but a list with the cocktail and its original origins is a great way to bring some of the history of the cocktail into the dining experience. I would also like to see some recommended pairings of cocktails and the various food items. Bottom line though, to quote the terminator, I'll be back. :-)"}
{"text":"First off if you're lucky enough to have Angel as your server you will have a great experience!  We had three different pies and the breakfast Sammy.  All were very good.  Drink specials!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and I regret not going there sooner! Cute date night space with comfortable chairs. Service was good. Ordered the bruschetta, jalapeño Mac and cheese, and the Manny pizza - all amazing!"}
{"text":"Very pricey for small pizzas that are okay tasting. Also bought a large Caesar salad and it looked like a small. There are better pizza joints out there with better tasting, descent sized pizza and salads."}
{"text":"To start I hope to get back to this place another time to hopefully have it redeem itself. It seemed like maybe a poor menu choice (recommended also by the waiter) might have skewed my visit.  My girlfriend and I loved the vibe of the place. Very trendy and some awesome seating. The location is great for first Fridays downtown. We didn't have to wait long on a Saturday night, and the food didn't take long either.  I was torn between an amazing sounding pizza and a burger that equally sounded delicious. But I was intrigued by this hotdog covered in Mac and cheese concoction. Against my better judgement I tried it out. It was not great. It wasn't even good. I think the disappointment in that dish overshadowed the unique feel and fun time at the place.  The staff, especially or waiter, was awesome. Which is why I hope it was just a poor menu choice. I hope to be able to edit this later with a great review about their Pizza as that is what I really want to try!"}
{"text":"Great food, lovely service, beautiful inside.  We sat outside on the patio, right on Central, and it was perfect on an October night in AZ."}
{"text":"I went for brunch, which I was thrilled about, and had a service experience that guarantees I will never spend another dollar here.  The brunch food is predictably good, and while the cocktails sound pricey, you get a half-carafe, so it' s actually a bargain. I would have considered this experience a complete win if the hostess hadn't had a very carrying voice when she was mocking me to a bartender in roughly the tones of seventh-grade mean girls.  I have no doubt that plenty of other service staff make fun of women older than their twenties who are dining alone -- but they do it in the kitchen, or back at the drink station, where I can't hear them. I get to retain the illusion, from my server, that I'm a valued customer. Pizza People Pub broke that illusion.  From their point of view, that's a win, since it means I'll never sully their restaurant with my unworthy presence again -- but if you're not part of a large party or young-and-hip or both, don't go here. The staff despises you, and they won't necessarily keep it a secret. Spend your money where the service staff takes the trouble to do a better job maintaining the lie."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and was impressed with the selection of beer, wine and food on special. My table ordered a round of drinks ($5 wines were awesome) and threw in the mac and cheese that was on happy hour. The mac was passable, but the salt ratio was enormous. I chugged down a glass of wine just to be able to finish it.   Next came the pies we ordered, \"the hottie\" (sausage, jalapeno, green chili and serrano peppers) was very spicy but once again entirely too salty. Thesame can be said for the \"date me\", even with the goat cheese and dates there was so much salt I was gulping down water the entire time.   So Pizza People is decent, I would go back for happy hour, but seriously ease up on the salt!  They still pale in comparison to Parlor, Bianco or Pomo."}
{"text":"it's hard to give this place any credit because it has one bathroom for men, which obviously can be locked from outside. yes one. I went on lunch yesterday waited 10 min outside the bathroom because someone was in it. never got a chance to wash hands before I ate. id either advise against going if you plan on drinking anything or just wear a diaper. although I didn't see a garbage disposal for undergarments either. maybe it's in the bathroom ?"}
{"text":"This place has such a great vibe. The jalapeño canoes, Mac n cheese with truffle oil and pizzas are great! I have had excellent service both times I've visited and while I can't make it downtown as often as I'd like, I try to make it a point to eat there when I'm nearby!"}
{"text":"Took my GF here when visiting AZ, pizza was awesome, beer was good, nice atmosphere, nice staff"}
{"text":"We met some friends here, and I didn't expect to think much of it.  I figured it would be typical pub food.  But the pizza was actually really yummy!  We had the \"Fun Guy\" pizza (love the silly names here), and it was delicious.  Very rich (almost to the point where we had to stop eating it).  The crust was very thin and crispy so if you like your pizzas that way, you'll like this place.  We also had the hummus, and that too was enjoyable.  It's a cute little place with original artwork and a laid back atmosphere.  I would come back if I wanted a place to kick back with friends."}
{"text":"Not sure how this pizza joint will keep up. Central Phoenix has a rash of pizza places now and the competition is fierce. Better have a signature that keeps people coming back. Not sure what it is here..."}
{"text":"Food was delivered, but it tasted great. Ordered a pasta dish and really like the noodles. The sausage was very rich in flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing place for pizza and the ambiance is great! I have been here several times and it has not failed me. From the cocktail drinks, appetizers, and pizza, all of them have been very good and have nothing to complain about. It is relaxing and a hidden spot for Arizona since it is fairly new. I would recommend the wings and the margherita pizza, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a tricky location to find, or find parking in, but once I was there, I admired the atmosphere and let the waiter talk up the product since it was my first visit.   \"Would you like to try a pizza starting with our vegan crust...\"  My vegetarian dining companion salivated.  \"...and topped off with our mozzarella blend and [a couple meat items]?\"  At this point, I was confused by the angle of this place, and how this dinner was going to turn out. If you're not vegan, you don't care that the crust is. If you are, why are you advertising toppings made from animals first? Fortunately, reading the menu unveiled all the cool options and substitutions and whatnot. You can try pizzas that are 100% vegan. You can also load yours up with meat, with traditional choices like the \"testosteroni\".   At my most hungry, I am not an adventurous diner, so I ordered that. But first, my monkey bread appetizer. The bread itself is good, and the garlic superb. They could tone down the butter a bit, though. There shouldn't be a pool of it at the bottom of the basket. Overkill.  As for the pizzas, they're about $10 and 10 inches. The crust? Amazing. Great stuff. The sauce? forgettable. The mozzarella, and whatever it's blended with was also bland. The parmesan shaker had to come to the rescue! The toppings were also pretty lame, leaving me to wonder if they just scrape the toppings off a frozen pizza and put them on a really awesome crust.   The bar here is okay. I like to see some of the lesser-known tap selections, like Raj. My cucumber rickey was disappointing. I expect a rickey to pack a punch while at the same time being light and refreshing. Theirs was packed with way too much syrup, and I struggled to finish it. If you're familiar with my reviews, you know most drinks don't scare me away!  I can understand why this product was successful in the mobile food business. If I were out at First Friday, or some bar, I'd gladly pay to have their personal pie on the go. But when I'm sitting down in a stylish establishment, I expect a little better than what is obviously fast food quality. We could just as easily go to Hanny's or The Parlor for a pizza/cocktail combo at a similar price range. Maybe if I tried more exotic toppings I'd have liked it better. Maybe I should try their variety of food besides pizza. Maybe I'll give this place another try, but not before exploring the tons of other new spots in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"After chasing down this pizza truck for a good lunch time meal, I was pleased when I saw these guys had taken over the spot of (forgot the name of the restaurant, meh who cares) anywho I decided to go for something on the menu aside from pizza since I know how good the pizza is. I opted for the sausage cheese dip and wings.  I like my wings a little crisper and fried and these were baked - but they were OK so nocomplaints here, the ranch was really good. The dip wasn't my thing but I ordered it so I won't complain about theat either, if I wanted cheese and sausage I should have just had pizza instead...  The girl that took my order was very nice and the owner of course is friendly. Give them a try, I'll be back"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good as was the salad. Drinks were also pretty good."}
{"text":"LOVE!  LOVE!  LOVE!  The mac & cheese is the best!  I just get the plain with nothing else in it.  Get a side of fruit and an iced tea and you are set for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I wish there were more stars to give. I've loved this place since it was just a food truck but their restaurant is above and beyond. I could go on and on about how awesome their food is but you really just need to know a few things: they have awesome apetizers, the pizzas are unique and delicious (I recommend the fun guy with pineapple), vaquero burger is probably my favorite burger ever, 10 different kinds of mac and cheese (that alone should bring you to their door), and awesome salads. Oh and they have both vegan and gf options if you have dietary challenges.  SOOO now let's talk about my favorite part of the package. amazing service. I am a service freak. If you have poor service I'm likely to never return and to write a review about my limited free time being ruined. The opposite is true here. Pizza people has FANTASTIC, AMAZING, ABOVE, AND ABOVE AND BEYOND SERVICE. Seriously, top notch. One time, I ordered online and the fax never came through. They comped half my meal and gave me a desert just because I had to wait ten minutes.   And today the owner was pitching in and helping serve when they were busy and had a backup. Some ranch fell off of a plate and fell on the ground LIGHTLY splattering our way. The manager gave us more apologies that we deserved, gave us 50% off of our meal, and a bunch of awesome coupons.  I first came to pizza people because I love the fun guy. but now I go to pizza people because they are the nicest people and as a perk they have a fun menu and awesome drinks.  Best addition to DT in a long time."}
{"text":"Happy to find this place in the downtown neighborhood. Great waitstaff and some really delicious meals.  I recommend the garlic monkey bread.  I will definitely be back, can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The only thing I like at this place is the atmosphere and location. The food had no flavor and was mediocre. Our server didn't make us feel welcome or answer our questions with interest or recommend anything on the menu and we pointed it was our first time. I won't be coming back. Terrible experience. Cannot understand everyone else's good reviews. Don't waste your time people go to nook instead or pizza heaven. Point is way better places to dine around the area."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a person who cares for pizza or beer so you can imagine the thoughts going through my head when informed this is where I'd be having dinner one night last week.  I actually ate a protein bar before I went but a friend said to me, it's like a nice restaurant/bar, it's not your typical \"pizza\" place.  I was actually quite impressed, it was really nice inside and not the kind of \"pizza\" place I thought I was going to.  There was 6 of us, we had a ton of drinks, the cucumber drink was on special this night for only $4.  Not being that hungry after having a snack before hand, I had the pesto hummus with veggies which was delicious.  I love pesto and the bread it came with was also delicious, very warm, baked to perfection and seasoned with some garlic.  My friends of course ordered pizzas, one had the money knots which he enjoyed and of course I was the one to get the \"random\" meal.  I love veggie patties and I love the vegan cheese from Daiya but really didn't want a whole burger.  Our server was nice enough to let me order just the black bean patty with the vegan cheese and it was to die for.  It tasted so delicious and didn't have that tex-mex flavor that I don't really care for.  Christina was our server this night and she was great! Extremely friendly, told us all their most popular menu items and made several drink suggestions for us.  The guys I was with were of course ordering drink after drink and she was definitely able to keep up.  My 2 guy friends also wanted a picture with her and she went along with it so thank you!  I recommend this \"pizza\" place, especially if you're like me and like nice restaurants, this is the spot to go for great food, drinks and service!"}
{"text":"We haven't had the chance to visit Pizza People Pub in over two years, and it was wonderful to discover the food remains great and the service is attentive.  We arrived a little after 4pm on a Saturday. The place was pretty empty and we were seated right away.   For drinks, my husband had a session beer on tap and I had a Blackberry Crush that was wonderfully refreshing on a 90-degree spring day. He also ordered the Drewpy Fries appetizer, which featured a pound of potato wedges drowning in cheese sauce and generous amounts of chopped bacon and prosciutto. The dish was really well done and exactly as described. Our son wasn't into it--we have found he's more of a fry guy than a potato wedge guy--but my husband loved it and we brought about half home.  Our main dishes were eclectic and delicious. Our son had the small regular macaroni and cheese--but small is still a heaping 1-cup of pasta, and he barely made a dent in it. More leftovers! I had the Willo Grove Salad. Everything was fresh and it was tossed with just the right amount of dressing. It's interesting to pair sweet elements like dates with the sourness of olives, but it works. My husband had the Testosteroni pizza and loved it, as he has before.  Here's hoping we can return here soon!"}
{"text":"Hey, the food is great. But I can get great food anywhere downtown. What makes this place a one star is their incompetent employees and rude manager Drew.  Called ahead to ask if they had the NFL package and if they'd be showing the games for tomorrow. Employee said yes! They've have it for two months! Great, let's bring a 10+ party there and spends lots of money.  Nah, employee lied. They've never had it (why say they've had it for two months?? Such a weird lie). Rude, whatever, go to another bar instead. Spoke with the manager and said look, I know it's not your fault an employee lied. Could you maybe have a note for your employees that you don't do football?   Manager responds with \"sorry that happened.\"  They sounded as if I had told them I stubbed my toe. I wasn't expecting a grand apology or coupon or anything, I just noted an easy way to avoid the mistake. The manager instead ignored me when I spoke and just said, I quote, \"new people sometimes lie.\"  Yeah. I don't think pizza tastes good when it's covered in lies."}
{"text":"Was in PHX on a work trip and after dinner nearby on a Saturday night, went driving looking for somewhere to grab a cold one. I'm rolling down Central and I see/hear the restaurant on my right, with music playing from the patio and scattered groups enjoying themselves. PPP is the epitome of millennial-bating. It sits on the ground floor of a building of loft apartments, lights in mason jars hang from the ceiling, Death Cab was on the stereo, independent art (for sale) adorned the walls, the menu is overflowing with hipstery offerings (see: sweet & spicy Korean wings, vegan pizza, 10 kinds of mac & cheese (amazingly, no Sriracha)), and as the business name suggests, they're all about \"building community\" over good food and grog. Not that this is a bad thing - see my 5 stars! I can't say anything about the food, but the beer was affordable and the selection diverse, the music was a good representation of my iPod, and the bartender was chill. I see no reason not to go again if I'm hungry and in the hood."}
{"text":"Casual lunch spot. Went for the Mac and cheese WOW we tried 3 kinds and all of them were exceptional. Jalapeño boats were great too. Service was decent. Ordered a salad that was suppose to have oranges as one of the main ingredients  I guess they  completely forgot about that ???? I will give them another try when I want my mac and cheese fix. Even the small size is plenty to share :)"}
{"text":"This quaint pizza pub is a great little travel oasis. It's about a block away from Spaghetti factory and is a great alternative when full. Love the Mac & Cheese option too during Happy Hour.   Easy access from the metro train."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came in around 10:00p.m. Because they were open later. And we are glad we did, they have vegan safe options which is hard to find open late. We got the \"Classic Pub\" Burger with the vegan black bean patty and vegan cheese.  Nice filling big mouth burger with an amazing thick bun, and thick cut veggies nice and crisp when you bit in to the burger, quality you could taste  Everything cooked perfectly with a very generous field greens side salad.  Can't wait to come back, I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"I found myself at Burton Barr Library for a meeting yesterday and went to this place for lunch. I have to say I was impressed.  They don't sell by the slice, but they do have 10 inch pizzas. I guess you call this a gourmet pizza, but not in an over-the-top way. I had the Testosteroni and it had pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, onion, and I think it was fresh basil. The crust was just perfect. Well worth the $10.50.  Service was attentive and friendly and the place was pleasant. We were there at 1PM and the crowd was light, I recommend this place if you want to spend a little more for lunch that you would for fash food."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and the staff are amazing!  Our bartender Natalie had great recommendations on the food and we had a lot fun chatting with her while eating at the bar top. The new owner, Michael Cole, is very attentive, personable, witty, and absolutely delightful. His passion for his restaurant, guests and staff definitely shows. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"We are lucky enough to live near Pizza People Pub and go there all the time.  The employees are always very friendly and since we're there often enough, they greet us by name.  The drinks are great and the food is awesome, every time.  Don't expect anything too snobby on the menu... it is mainly pizza and comfort foods like mac n cheese, wings, and burgers (all excellent though.)  I've tried several flavors of the mac cheese and so far I can't pick a favorite - same goes for the pizza.  I also like to watch football games there on occasion.  They offer a brunch menu on weekends, which I've tried as well, the challah bread french toast was really good.  I haven't had a bad experience and would highly recommend Pizza People Pub for a laid back, friendly atmosphere paired with great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Ok where do I begin....let's start at the zombies, great drinks really enjoyed them. Next was the wings half spicy buffalo half parm and herb. Very delicious and lots of meat on the bones. Best part was the amazing homemade ranch and blue cheese dressings. They were delicious and very tasteful. Next was the MB Salad however we used the agave vinegarette dressing and was very tasteful. Finally we ordered the Kuai Pizza (kept it simple) crust and flavor were spot on. Then there was service....Angel did a great job guiding us through our options and had GREAT recommendations. Will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Good, but not the greatest pizza, but a great time with friends.  Love the location since it's the heart of the hipster arts district right next to the light rail- PERFECT for people-watching from the patio seating! I met up with friends here for my first First Friday. Since I was running late, one friend ordered food for me while in-transit. Unbeknownst to me that my request for a slice of pizza was fulfilled by their small 10\" pizza which arrived ~30 minutes after I arrived. A little peeved it took so long and I wasn't informed about it. However I arrived really hungry so the 10\" was perfect. It's not necessarily thin-crust though. I ordered the Cucumber Rickey as one friend had done so before me and it looked refreshing and he liked it. My thoughts were opposite of him - definitely not the best gin Rickey drink I've ever had & way too much cucumber flavor.   I am definitely open to returning to try something else on the menu& another house cocktail."}
{"text":"Great place.  I had the Encanto burger which was incredible. So many layers of flavors.  $3 dollar ice tea seemed a little exorbitant but the food and our waitress overcame the expense."}
{"text":"This is a great gem of a place right on the light rail.  They serve the most amazing Mac 'n Cheese dishes, 10 different flavors and the jalapeno canoes are soooo good.  Place has a great vibe and the prices are just right.  Did I mention the mac n cheese?"}
{"text":"This place is one of the only places in PHX that I've found that serves corn on pizza.   CORN RULES!!!  I ordered a mac and cheese pizza and then had them put corn on it.  It was a taste explosion that I thought was going to shatter my molars.  They also have black beans as a pizza topping, which is almost just as clutch as having corn.  Plus, they have a masterpiece painting of Mr. T taming a dinosaur without resorting to using weapons.  The beer selection is adequate enough to was down your corn pizza.    Thanks, Pizza People Pub, for offering Valley cornophiles a place to get corn on their pizza."}
{"text":"I'm sure that there are things at this place that are well known and that PPP excels in, but mac 'n cheese was not one of those things. The mac here literally tastes like Velveeta and shells, I expected so much more when I plunged my fork into the baked cheesy goodness, but the bowl fell short. My friend was not too happy with the portions either, you end up paying $10 for a small fancy bowl of Velveeta mac. I gave this place three stars for the service and for the happy hour prices/selection. I want to like this place for many reasons (location, ambiance, etc.), but I am a loyal fan of mac 'n cheese and I cannot come here again for theirs."}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and a couple times for happy hour. I'll never come back for lunch. The food is good but I simply can't afford the time it takes waiting for food even though only half-dozen tables have customers.  Consistently awful."}
{"text":"Located Downtown and easily located for parking.   The service was super friendly and tried to assist with menu options.  The \"Manny\" pizza was amazing - I cant wait to try again.  The Jalapeno Cream Cheese and Bacon were perfect mixture."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Our waitress was adorable and attentive.  We got drewpy fries - such a delight - share with friends and skip 'em if you are on a diet.   We did not get the pizza, we focused on Mac and Cheese. Mac and Cheese at a pizza joint? Umm yeah - a ton of different base flavors and you can add your own extras when ordering. I loved the regular with sausage. The Korean sweet & spicy was awesome too.   I will be back, I will bring friends, and I may wear elastic waisted pants."}
{"text":"F I v e    s t a r Ohhh yesss i diiiid :) The food, the atmosphere,  the service,     it.was.phenomenal.  This place was poppin'. Dj got it going on and the place was packed, but just a 10 minute wait. :))  Truffle Mac and cheese, with mushroom is to dieeee for. You might think its a weird combo, but the texture was perfect.   The hulk pizza was superb. It was so delicious, the sauce was different,  idk how to explain it. Haha.. the crust was crispy just the way I like it. I must come back for this again!!!  At the end we got a complimentary mason jars so we can get our drinks for free, and also received two tokens, for $10 off our next visit. Andddddd a raffle ticket, they're giving away a bike :))  YAYYYYY FOR PIZZA PEOPLE PUB"}
{"text":"So........me and my friends Kate and Louie were headed on down to the Cardinal game at Chase Field.  We decided to meet up for dinner beforehand.  We were originally going to go to a different pizza joint but it turns out they were closed on Mondays.  So were a bunch of other restaurants downtown...pretty much a food ghost town on Mondays.  Kate busted out her handy Yelp app and saw that Pizza People Pub was pretty close by plus they were open on Mondays.  I had personally never heard of the place, but I was in the mood for pizza to begin with, so Pizza People Pub sounded like a cool new spot to check out.  We headed on down that way.    It's right on Central near the Library and they have their own free parking lot...very cool.  We walked in and found the place to be very appealing.  It was hip but not \"douchebag hipster\".  More of a mellow vibe.  Not too many people were in the place and we were seated immediately.  About that.......the interior of the restaurant looks more like a smoking lounge than a restaurant.  They have these huge, high back, (p)leather chairs at the tables and some couches as well as high top tables with bar stool type chairs.  We were seated at a table right by the door with the high back chairs.  These chairs were so comfy and were hands down the best restaurant chairs I have ever sat in.  On to the food...........  This place is known for their pizzas and drinks.  Hence the name, Pizza People Pub.  Every day they have a \"drink of the day\" and it is only $4.00.  Kate and Louie partook in some of their beverages and they said that they were great!  The first time there, (yes...it was so good on Monday, we came back AGAIN on Wednesday) I went with a pizza called \"The Hottie\".  This was a pizza that came with green chiles, serrano chiles, jalapenos, mozzarella and sausage.  The second night there, I went with an order of Spud Fingers (oven roasted potatoes) and I went with a pizza that is currently not on their online menu.  I think the name of it was \"The Manny\".  This pizza had mozzarella, jalapeno cream cheese, onions, pepperoni, bacon, chili flakes and avocado.  Here is how they were............  The Hottie-  This was awesome!  They cut up fresh jalapenos and serranos and layer them  all over the pizza.  The pizza is topped with tons of green chile as well as crumbled sausage.  All of this is placed on top of a cornmeal dusted crust and then fired up in their oven.  It was damn tasty!  Spicy but not \"burn your mouth\" spicy.  The crust was very flavorful and held up well with all the toppings it had on it.  I would definitely get this again.   The Manny-  This pizza was fantastic except for one part of it.....the avocado.  They cut up pieces of avocado and put a slice on each piece (6 pieces total).  The problem with it was that the avocado was severely bruised and browned.  I'm not sure how they even brought that out and served it like that.  That was my only complaint with the whole dining experience.  I removed all the avocado and ate the rest of the pizza.  Good thing is, even without the avocado, this pizza was awesome!  It  had a ton of bacon on it, lots of chili flakes to give it a lot of heat, good pepperoni and even a few onions.  They kicker was the jalapeno cream cheese.  It was dolloped on sort of like ricotta.  It was creamy, spicy and added a nice flavor profile.  Minus the nasty ass avocado, this pizza was delicious!  Not as good as The Hottie, but still great flavors.  Spud Fingers-  They come 1lb to an order and they are served with their garlic/dill ranch sauce.  It was a thinner sauce but it went perfect with these potatoes.  It tasted great and was one of the better ranch type dressings I had ever had.  The potatoes had a little crunch on the outside and were soft on the inside.  They had sprinklings of parsley and salt on them and the flavor was great!  One order is big enough to share between a few people.  Kate and Louie ordered pizzas both nights and they liked what they got.  They also went with their Garlic Monkey Bread and their Piggies in Blankets.  I had a taste of each of those and they were great, too.  I am a pretty hard person to impress sometimes.  Pizza People Pub impressed me immediately!  Atmosphere is awesome, service was fantastic both nights, prices are reasonable and the food was great!  Another great pizza joint in Phoenix!  I will definitely be back!  Fantastic find by Kate!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere outside with a nice view of Central and Downtown Phoenix. Convenient location to the light rail and Hance Park. The wings were legit and this pizza was on point. Perfect meal after a bike ride through downtown or a walk through the park. Also - if you're looking for a trendy, downtown hipster spot, this probably isn't it. If you're looking for some good beer and bar food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"this place was amazing! the food was incredible, the service was awesome, and they display very interesting original art pieces from local artists (which I love). they have a lot of great draft beers and wines circulating through their selection, so you know there's always something new to try. I went with the basics-pizza and wings- and left totally satisfied. also if you're a ranch lover (such as myself...despite my lactose intolerance ) they have a super delicious house ranch that I could eat all by itself."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the high back seats are great. I had the Sweet & Spicy Korean Wings they were AMAZING!!! We also had a pizza. It was average but still good."}
{"text":"This place has the best mac n' cheese in town! Super creamy and tastes of cheese rather than milk. The flavor combinations may seem a little odd, but they work well. My favorite is the White Parm and Corn. I'm so sad that it's closing. Service has always been great and friendly. Thank you for the delicious food over the years!"}
{"text":"This place had me at MAC and CHEESE and PIZZA. My two favorite things. They specialize is out of the box Mac. We ordered the Blue Cheese Mac, Mushroom Mac, and the Spicy Buffalo Mac. Wow wow wow..my taste buds loved every bite. The pizza is also homemade with fresh toppings. The 10inch Pizza and the Macs to share was plenty for me and my plus 1.  I would definitely be coming back here for lunch again to enjoy more items on their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My go to has always been the hummus and the mac and cheese.  However my fiancée and I tried the pizza for the first time on Friday and Wow now it's my favorite thing.   Yum is all I have to say for everything so far :-)"}
{"text":"Was recommended to come here by a friend, took them more than 20 minutes for server to come ask us for drinks. I had to go inside to look for our server because they forgot to come ask us for our food order. It's been now 40 minutes and still food hasn't arrived. Let me say this is the worst worst service I had. DO NOT COME HERE WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY!!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience was fantastic! Jeramy was extremely attentive, and was happy to help me out with recommendations. Great atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"I was pretty unsatisfied with this place. I was excited to try it and although our waiter was great, what we ordered was less than great. We ended up ordering a pizza and bruschetta. The bruschetta was had way too much onion in it for my liking but I understand every place makes it differently. What was most upsetting is that the pizza AND bruschetta bread were burnt! And I don't mean toasted, it was blackened burnt. The only reason we didn't send it back was because they were on the verge of closing and we didn't want to inconvenience them by having them remake it. I find it disturbing that they would actually allow for this to come out of the kitchen though, regardless of the time of night. To be honest I don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"I had the Hottie pizza with ham added. Good pizza. Only large enough for 1 hungry person or 2 as a snack. Fresh ingredients. I was presently surprised to see fresh jalapeños. Bright green and crispy. Only 5 Guy Burgers has better jalapeños."}
{"text":"I went here with the BF, my brother, his gf, and my niece and nephew yesterday for lunch. The place is cute, I like the way they have made the restaurant look...comfortable, yet modern. All of the food was delicious. I tried the Seoul pizza and it was delish...spicy, sweet, crunchy....just awesome. The crust was perfectly crunchy. The pizza was big enough for two people and only cost 9$. I also tried the monkey bread (really tasty little garlic knots) and the chop salad (not my fave, but I don't really like chopped salads generally). Also, they serve Hamm's! Can't beat it. I may just become a regular here."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. I had 2 different kinds of pizza (Testosteroni and the special taco pizza), 2 different Mac and Cheese, and the half baked cookie dessert, also the garlic monkey bread. Everything I ate was amazing, and all really fresh. Service was good, no issues at all. Price was decent, nothing more than other semi-casual restaurants. Definitely would recommend this to anyone in the area or not, and anyone in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!!!!! But I especially enjoyed their different assortment of Mac and cheese. You can even get mini portions!! Very coo!! You can choose from jalapeño, truffle, white parm and corn, spicy Korean, and so much more. I tried the white parm and corn and died!!!! I don't even like Mac n cheese!!! But wow!!! Very good!!! I didn't think the Korean dishes tasted Korean but props for trying. Nonetheless everything was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 5-6 times now and never have I been disappointed. The food is great. I had a salad this time. I tried the P3. It was delicious. Could have used a bit less dressing. The salad was swimming ;) Next time.   The beer is always good and cold.   The hottie pizza is a favorite but be careful. It is one hot sunufa beep."}
{"text":"The pizza we had was good. The appetizer cheeses chicken puffs were unappetizing they were filled with chicken purée so like acting baby food wrapped in dough. We also had the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese, it was a bit overpowering in the buffalo flavor quite spicy. I would not order the Mac and cheese again. Out service was just so so. We would return for the pizza."}
{"text":"I was sad when Ken Cheuvront closed the doors here to keep his place at PHX Sky Harbor, but Pizza People is a welcomed replacement!   The first thing you need to order is one of their Mac n Cheese selections. Whoa. I LOVE the Spicy Buffalo Mac. One of my friends tried the Bleu Mac and another the Korean Sweet & Spicy Mac... all worth the extra 20 minutes you'll need to add to your next workout to burn off the calories... TOTALLY. Worth it. Yum.   As for the pizza, they're all great! I've shared the following: Testosteroni, Date Me, Seoul Fire and The Hottie. (I've been here several times - I'm not THAT much of a fatty.) The Date Me is my fave, with Mozz, Goat Cheese, Proscuitto, Dates, Arugula and Agave Vinaigrette.   I don't think they serve desserts here - but if you have room when you're done, eek... eat more Mac n Cheese! I also haven't tried the wings but have heard great things about them! OH - the Piggies in Blankets are flipping great too!   They have a fair selection of local (high five!) craft beers on tap as well as a slew of fun cocktails and a nice wine selection. They also has happy hour 3-6:30pm every day with $1 off all drinks. Welcome to the 'hood PPP - please stick around for a while!"}
{"text":"I just ordered my pizza and salad  for delivery from this place and it's only about two miles from where I live yet the food arrived cold. What a waste of money and the 45 minutes I waited."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened back up! Pizza people pub has the best Mac n cheese in town. The pesto Mac is my favorite but the parm and corn is delicious too. Good beer selection and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have a special fondness for Pizza People because one time, I patronized their food truck on Halloween in a cheerleader costume and they felt bad I had no place to sit. So, the co-owner lent me their stepladder, LOL. Anyway, I *finally* tried this place a few days after Christmas for a Friday night dinner. It did not disappoint.   They were super accommodating to our party, which started out as five people but more friends showed up for drinks later. We had the garlic monkey bread, which is essentially just garlic rolls with a marinara sauce and an aioli. The bread had a really good texture but I wish it had been a little bit more garlicky. We also had the jalapeno halves stuffed with cheese, which were very tasty and not too spicy. Five of us had 3 10\" pizzas--the Date Me (mozzarella, goat cheese, prosciutto, cheese, dates), the Hottie (jalapenos, sausage, serrano peppers, basil ) and the Fun Guy (mushroom, mozzarella, arugula, truffle oil). The Hottie was a little too hot for me to handle but it still tasted good. I'm a fan of truffle oil so no complaints about the Fun Guy. I highly endorse the Date Me because the combo of dates with cheese is almost culinary magic.   I know it seems like central Phoenix already has a lot of gourmet pizza places (Federal, The Parlor, Pomo like a mile away, and of course Pizzeria Bianco) but I think Pizza People have made themselves standout. Also, the space has a great atmosphere for talking intimately or with a big group. When I was there, one of the owners was catching up with some friends at one table. To me, that just added to the \"town pub\" feel.   Unfortunately, our server kept forgetting to factor in a $5 off coupon we had. I think he was overwhelmed because our party kept changing. Since I plan to eat here again, it wasn't a big deal so I just saved the coupon for next time."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it is never a disappointment. The lighting and atmosphere is always good and perfect for a date night. There chairs are the most comfy, iIm could sit in them all day. We usually get the Hottie as our main pizza, which is definitely  hot! The servers are always is in good spirits!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm only doing \"mostly veg\" right now so I may have meat once or twice a week. I decided to use up one of my meat allowances here and boy did I get my money's worth. I had the Truffle mac (and cheese) with hot italian sausage. My goodness, I could have died it was so darn good. Just perfect. I can't articulate exactly how it was perfect, just that the flavor was out of this world. High quality sausage. I think I read another review that said they made their own sausage? I could totally see that. It tasted very fresh.  The Agave Apple Slaw which my friends raved about wasn't bad but the minute I opened the dressing container, my senses were assaulted with the intense stench of vinegar which is still hanging in the air. It calmed down a bit after sitting on the salad for a bit. I will try it again when I eat in. Today, i took it to go.   My co-workers loved their Pepperoni pizzas and monkey bread (which were more like garlic knots) with awesome flavor.  Staff  is very friendly. Jamie is awesome. Fantastic customer service. I'm also a fan of sister restaurant, Switch. I think this place is here to stay, folks.   I will update once I've tried other meals here for the big picture. The fact of the matter is, there WILL be a next time...mmmm mmmm  10/11/13 update:  Mushroom mac is tasty. But the Truffle mac is definitely my fave for life.  Co-workers highly recommend: Pub Burger, Leezie's Sweet & Spicy Korean wings, and Seoul Fire pizza. One said the Jalapeno canoes were too mild which means I will probably like them.  Tom, an owner I believe he said, who intro'd himself to me and thanked me for being a new regular. That was very cool.  If you haven't eaten here yet, what ARE you waiting for? It's just across Central from the Burton Barr library."}
{"text":"Really love this place! Second time I have been here. I organized a going away party for one of my managers and the staff at Pizza People Pub were amazing to us! For a party of 30, the servers were above and beyond! Everyone loved the food: incredible Pizzas ( my fave is the Hottie), burgers, appetizers, yummy Mac and Cheese and more! Thank you Pizza People Pub, you were stellar!!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends just over a week ago for some post-First Friday refreshment.  We just shared some pitchers of beer but the decor was cool and our server Drew was really attentive.  In fact, I left my sunglasses there and Drew was responsible for reuniting me with them three days later.  I called up the following morning and he answered the phone and remembered our party.  He held the glasses there for me to pick up the following nonfat after work.  I was so grateful that I figured I had to give the pizza a try.    So glad I did!  I tried the Popeye.   It had red sauce, spinach, tomato, Mozzarella, garlic and basil.  The toppings were all super fresh and the crust was delicious!  The ten inch personal size was just right.    I'm definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"So -- I still haven't had the pizza here.  I guess I'm just not a pizza person. But the more I think about it, I think it IS fair to judge them on their non-pizza food, because even if it isn't their specialty, if it's on their menu it should taste good!  I came here again for lunch this time and ordered their salad that comes with pesto and dressing on top.  It was the saltiest thing I have ever eaten!!  The pesto had too much salt, the dressing had too much salt, it also had cheese on it, and when all those things combined it was basically just SALT.  my mouth had that funny burning feeling after I ate because of all the salt.  Whoever taste-tested and approved this menu item has got terrible tastebuds.  Also, my friend ordered a salad but they brought her out a totally different salad.  And since we were there on a lunch break she didn't have time for them to make the right salad for her... strange and not cool.  I hope this place does well because it's nice to have a business on that corner instead of an empty lot, but they seriously need to revisit some of their menu items and strive for GOOD, not mediocrity."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a football game the other night.  Pizza People Pub rocks!  I had a Grande Pub Shrub, which is NOT for people that can't handle spice... there's literally a jalapeno in the drink!  If you go for that drink choice, definitely do the Yelp check-in for the free garlic monkey bread, since you'll need to lick something in order to stop your tongue from burning.  Also, the drink says \"serves 2\" on the menu for a reason.  Since I was on a spice kick for the day, we selected the Manny pizza, which our waiter hinted to us was the best pizza on the menu.  I'm a huge fan of avocado, so the fact that the pizza was served with slices of fresh avocado on top was a big bonus.  Overall, great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great pizza, especially the poorly punned Fun Guy, but the highlight for us is the mac and cheese. I prefer the sun dried tomato, but the regular is the most popular in the house."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic restaurant with superb garlic knots, pizza, and fingerling potatoes, and amazing salad.  Also ambience is super cool and the prices are right.  There should be one of these in every City in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, with great employees. We will definitely return for another bite. Anthony Q was our server, and he did an amazing job assisting us first timers. We received such Great customer service. Please, go check out this pizza place! You'll eat a delish bite for a reasonable price:)"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza. Drinks watered way down. Service also mediocre. And to add insult to injury, there are no misters in the outdoor seating area. In the hottest desert climate in the entire United States. I have never ever been to a restaurant here that doesn't have misters. Is that even legal?!?!  Needless to say, my first trip to Pizza People Pub also served as my last.   *Parking situation is also a travesty*"}
{"text":"I wENT for for the first time for happy hour with a group of my co-workers. I had the Blackberry Crush to drink, which was pretty and delicious. I then had The Hulk to eat, and definitely recommend it. The atmosphere was fun, and service was pretty decent (just a tad slow in bringing refills and the check at the end of the night)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Date Me loaded with non-dairy mozzarella, goat cheese, minced prosciutto, chopped dates, arugala & a vinaigrette all on a gluten free crust.  The first mouthful was bliss, as I got a little taste of everything.  The saltiness of the prosciutto & the sweetness from the dates was amazing.  The crust was thin & crunchy and yet sturdy enough to hold all the delightful toppings with every bite.  The fresh arugala made it a little messy to eat but we were tucked away in our hotel, so we could watch the Warriors playoff game.    It was a 10 inch pie with six pieces.  Four slices was sufficient for dinner!  I'd definitely eat here again if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Did happy hour here last night with my alumni network and it was a great time. Because it was a group event, I only tried a couple things that were pre-ordered, but all were pretty good. The hummus was excellent and came with some crispy - chewy very tasty bread, as well as carrots and cucumbers. We also had very delicious, flavorful, and slightly greasy (yum) fingerling potatoes. We had several pizzas that were good, but not fabulous. The crust was tasty-crispy-chewy but the toppings were just good (not great).   The wines by the glass list was short, but they had decent reds and whites.   The service was pretty good considering we were such a large group.   Overall a vey good experience.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere and food. It would have been better if my 'biggie' Mac and cheese was hot. The center was unacceptably cold. The server was nice enough but slow to attend yet kind and polite."}
{"text":"Top notch.  Such a fun place, super cute and intimate.   Try the Jalepenos in the spring. Sppicaaay  but delicious.   Pizza is also unique and tasty perfect for date night and shared for two people. 2 is great for a small family and some left to take home.   Cocktails hit the spot, nothing spectacular but delicious."}
{"text":"Go on a Tuesday for great specials! $5 cheese pizza, half salad, big mac n cheese and house wine on special for $4 on Tuesday"}
{"text":"Yesterday I was riding the light rail downtown for lunch with friends, on the way up I saw Pizza People Pub.  Looked interesting, not exactly my neighborhood, but I thought it might be worth a try.  On the way back, the train stopped in front of it, so I fired up the Yelp app on my phone and saw the very high rating.  Last night we had plans to go to a movie with a friend, but those plans got scuttled so we decided on dinner.  Everyone agreed that pizza was a good fit, so I suggested we try this place and off we went.  Appetizer: honey/ginger wings.  Very good.  Nicely messy fingers when done, thoroughly enjoyed all-around.  Dinners: my wife had a date pizza, which is to say, a pizza made with dates.  It's safe from me.  She quite liked it, ate 2/3rds of it there.  Bob had a veggie pizza which he devoured, there were no survivors.  I had a peperoni pizza with crisp bacon and onions, and it was quite good, though it would have been better had the onions been cooked down rather than just raw and put on top.  I'll have to specify that if we make it back there.  The universal opinion was that this is a good pizza place.  It was kinda noisy, I'd be hesitant to do a weekend night there.  There was a group of about 30 people there and the place was a lot quieter when they finished their meal and went in to meeting mode.  So a good pizza is definitely to be had here.  We wouldn't mind trying their burgers some time.  But it's not quite the pizza that I'm looking for: I'm on a fool's quest to find a pizza like one that I enjoyed as a teen at a place in Sunnyslope called Tommy's that's been gone for probably over 20 years.  Some day I'll find something similar.  Until then, Pizza People Pub will be on my list as a place for good pizza.  Just make sure you turn in on the north entrance before the building, the one on the south side leads to a private parking garage and you might have some challenge getting out of it."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner tonight. Service was great. Becky was an amazing server. She was attentive, knew the menu and suggestive items on the menu. Love the chop salad and macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"I was curious what went into the old Cheuvronts since I loved that place so much. Another pizza place? Sigh! I finally went here for a birthday party. The food is good but nothing to write home about. Better than most in town but not spectacular.   The pesto, Hummus dip is bland. It is missing something. What that something is I do not know. Maybe more spices, Basil? I did like the Pizza Pita type chips served with the dip but like I said nothing to die over. I am very picky about Pizza and what I had did not wow me but it wasn't bad either.  I have to admit though the service was amazing. Five stars. Overall, I would go back just to be spoiled. It is a pretty restaurant, has good food, and a good beer selection. Their Churros desert was yummy too."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Wonderful people, great food and nice ambiance keep me coming back!   You really cannot go wrong with anything you order here. The pizza is amazing and the Mac & Cheese should win awards (they have 10 different flavors)"}
{"text":"First met the Pizza people outside of Last Exit Live in their food truck a few months ago, so when they opened a restaurant I was over the moon. We had an opportunity to go there this past weekend, and oh boy! So yummy. I was between two specialty pizzas but they don't make 50/50s for them, so I picked the testosteroni one & added feta. The pizzas are single people pizzas. My lady had some veggie thing she loves & the kid had a make your own (she loves places that let her choose her own toppings!). Got local craft beers, piping hot pizza from the brick oven, and fantastic service from a local female business owner.  Go here. Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Vibe was nice and fun.  Service was great.  Food was meh; mac and cheese, wings and the Hottie pizza."}
{"text":"We came here last night because it was a beautiful night to enjoy sitting outside and I've seen this place was now open when I cruise up and down Central. I love that there is plenty of parking just on the north side of the building and the decor was cute on the inside. The World Series game was on and it made it seem much more like a sports bar than a pizza place but I can't blame them for having the game on their several TV's.   Our waiter was great! He anticipated our drink refills and we never had to wait a moment for anything. I must have drank like 5 glasses of tea. Being our first time, our waiter recommended their most popular Testostorini pizza and the White Parm and Corn Mac N Cheese. Just what I had in mind! I added tomatoes to my pizza and my fiance tried their wings. Unfortunately, the pizza wasn't all that great. It was okay, good crust, but it lacked a whole lot of toppings, sauce and cheese and made it a bit bland.  It definitely doesn't compare to the Pomo/Federal/Cibo pizza's that are within a few miles of this place. I sadly thought the Mac N Cheese was a bit bland but my fiance thought it was good. Maybe my tastebuds were off or something. He said his wings were just okay but it didn't sound like he'd be interested in coming back for them anytime soon.  Overall, great service, kind of a cool atmosphere inside, great urban patio outside and just mediocre food in my opinion. Rats. I had high hopes."}
{"text":"Best mac & cheese in the world love their garlic bread balls love their cups for alcohol love their mac & cheese love their atmosphere love them love everything drove from Flagstaff just to eat there mac & cheese. Break up with your boyfriend? Come here and eat their mac & cheese it will cheer you right up. Need to vent? They will listen while you eat their garlic bread balls. Best place ever. Need a cool person just to talk to ? DAVE IS YOUR GUY love h  LOVE JADE K SHES GREAT !!!!"}
{"text":"Reopened end of July. New owners. Happy hour prices aren't that good but the Mac and cheese is amazing! Good service as well."}
