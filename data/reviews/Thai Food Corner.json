{"text":"I love this place! I've been eating here since I was a kid and it used to be D's Thai Food. I've never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Want to eat the BEST Thai Food?

Thai Food Corner has to be your next dining destination. I have been coming to this restaurant since the beginning. I mean when they began in a small building (that was once a gas station) located on McKellips Road in Mesa, Arizona. That was over 20 years ago!

Our family are regulars here (Brown Road/Higley Road) and have ordered a majority of the menu. The never disappoint and I'm so hooked on all the curries available.

Ample portions, friendly service, quaint restaurant....I could go on and on about this place. Make Thai food Corner your next dining experience!"}
{"text":"Only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because the service isn't the best, the food is GREAT! I ordered the Pad Thai and it was up there with others I've had!"}
{"text":"I came in about an hour before closing and the staff there were rude. The food wasn't all that good. I had high hopes that other reviews were wrong but I agree that this place isn't all that good. I felt like I could make Thai food at home much better."}
{"text":"What a great place. Small, clean attractive and just great Thai food. This is a Mom And Pop place with friendly folks. We go there often when in Mesa. Hard to spend over $10 p/person. Great neighborhood eatery tucked in the corner . Try the Thai ice tea with cream!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but it is by far our favorite food in the area. The food is fresh, authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"In order for this place to have a low rating is because either competing Thai restaurants are stooping as low as to deface this great place or you are a hard to please snob that more than likely has MANY low rating reviews on this site.

This is a very authentic Thai food joint. It's family run, (which is absolutely key in this field) it's a quiet environment, and the staff is very kind and accommodating. As far as the food goes, EXCELLENT! My girlfriend who is a complete Thai food snob praises the place. 

The only complaint I have ever had is that one time I was there I had this table of about 8 people constantly looking at me. One of them finally asked, \"what did you order? it looks SO GOOD!\" Ok, I will let that one slide. It does look good, and tastes even better.

I just wish this place was a bit more conveniently located so they could have more reviews. This is a permanent spot for me and whoever I bring with me. A TRUE GEM IN MESA, AZ."}
{"text":"Didn't actually eat here, waited for 10 mins with no acknowledgement by the servers whatsoever. They were busy, food must be good in spite of the service. No thanks, jumped over to salad and go and ordered within 2 mins."}
{"text":"Small dining room, not sure there is even a restroom, but clean and service is prompt.  Owners very nice.  Food was excellent.  This thai place is truly thai as far as spices go.  Medium here is like hot elsewhere.  Great for curries!  If ordering anything else, would recommend mild.  Located in an older plaza in Alta Mesa area that looks a little run down.  Lots of parking though!  Would definitely try again, especially if in the mood for that face burning tingle with the hot and spicy.  Mmm."}
{"text":"Love the staff and the food :) Pork Larb and Tom Yum Gai are awesome!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Thai Food Corner for years.  It is our all around favorite Thai restaurant in Mesa.  Great food, great prices.  Yes it's small and not very fancy, but it is still our favorite.  I always get Massaman Curry and the Chicken Satay.  Love it."}
{"text":"Great LITTLE restaurant. Mom and Pop and Son owned. Great Chicken Pad Thai. Everyone I know that has been here raves about it."}
{"text":"The food here is like home-cooked comfort food from Thailand. There are some real gems in the menu like the Three Flavored Chicken and the yellow curry. All of it is good and the portions are fair. 

The only downside is that the place looks very sad. The decor is terrible, but the owners & employees are super nice. Overall, it's great, but looks bad."}
{"text":"I love Thai food it is probably my favorite cuisine and I also enjoy trying new places. I was sadly and sorely disappointed in Thai Corner. I went with my mom and we always order an appetizer entrees which we share then have enough for lunch the next day. The food looked amazing but I guess looks can be deceiving. I might as well have been eating plain noodles with steamed broccoli that is how bland the food was. Our appetizer (I can't remember the name) was an awkward concoction of deep fried noodles and some other unrecognizable fried things. The panang curry was soupy and lacked any of the depth or flavor of a true panang. The pad see ewe was like overcooked noodles with a little soy sauce and some mushy carrots. The food was so bland that I had to add soy sauce to give it a little flavor and when the waitress/owner saw me doing this she actually yelled at me telling me her food did not need soy sauce to which I replied, \" well I guess you have never tasted your food then.\" There is no reason to visit this establishment as 5 R Chas is only about a mile away and have far superior food to Thai Kitchen. So yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to the bland food and rude staff."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience i've had in my life ending with the owner threatening to call the cops on me and then complaining about me to other customers after i left, confirmed with me looking back and seeing his lips flapping, angry eyebrows, and pointing at me as i walked away.  

I wasn't even angry initially. Mistakes happen, it's fine, but I cannot say this was the same for him.  In addition to the inability to accept that he fudged my order, dude has some real anger issues. If anyone needs cops sicked on them, it's this guy.

Being from out of town, I was unaware about how strictly they enforced unwritten restaurant rules.  I came to the counter, glanced around not sure whether someone would take my order at a table, but the owner came up and asked what I would like.   10 min later, I received my order in a takeout box and walked over to sit down at a table, BUT he explained (1) I came to the counter instead of sitting at a table, so that means I am doing takeout and (2) he points to one other couple and explains business is slow so they're closed now (an hour earlier than what is posted outside). I'm ok with it, my mom and dad worked their lives off owning a small business, so I get up and say it's not a problem and sit outside. I pay for my food and leave a carry out tip. when i open my box, it is completely wrong. it was going out to go down my belly if i liked it, but after taking a bite it was instead going to go down the belly of a trash can, so I went back in.

Knowing they were closing, I didn't want to ask for a redo even though my growling tummy was telling me otherwise. I asked for a refund. He insisted my order was right, but I opened the box to show him that it wasn't and mentioned I also ordered a side
of rice which wasn't in there.  He mumbled angrily and did a lot of furious pointing saying at the the box.  I shrugged, saying that I get this all the time (US and Asia) and it has never looked or tasted so differently.  if there was an opposite to what i had ordered, what I got was it taste and lookwise.  He reads that comment as hostility and threatens to call the police. 

So I guess if they get your order right and if you act like they want, the food is fine, but god forbid otherwise.  Essentially, if this guy could have his way he would have the cops land you in jail for his mistakes.  But i guess we should be thankful that he ended up in the restaurant business rather than have the opportunity to be a dictator of a country or something."}
{"text":"Place is ok, a little small but it's ok. Food was pretty good also. Pad Thai, yellow chicken curry and panaeng was good. They don't serve hot oil though. Dried chilli did the job! Lol. Def coming back next time. Thai iced tea was good. Loved it. It was pretty big too compared to other Asian place."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened in the 90's at their privous location. In all that time I have never had a bad meal; it has always been amazing. Do yourself a favor and  get the egg rolls ...along with everything else lol."}
{"text":"My visit was OK, ordered the pad thai to go & peanut sauce with rice as well. The pad thai was a little bland- lacking the flavor of most I've had. I modified a few things as well and none of them were accounted for. Portions are very fair however! Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Sorry there aren't more pics, but we ate it all too fast! Let's keep this simple: Go here - GO HERE NOW! There's not a bad dish on the menu. You've got your classic Chinese dishes, AND Thai. And not just any Thai - perhaps the best I've had this side of the Grand Canyon. If you want a special treat, ask for the Thai omelette. It's not on the menu, but they'll make it for you if they're not too busy. It's basically heaven blended with paradise folded into nirvana. So go - live a little, and eat a lot! You only live once!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai Restaurants in town, and this is by far my favorite.  Several Thai people I know in the area feel the same way.  Prices are a bargain, service is great, and the food is authentic.  A family run restaurant which has been in business for quite a few years now.  If you come a few times you'll recognize several regulars who come often - always a good sign.  Standouts include Chicken Satay, Tom Yum Gai, Larb, Paneang Chicken, and the best Pad Thai and Thai iced tea in the Valley.  The staff is also more than willing to modify ingredients or spiciness to suit your taste.  A real gem, and worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Never had Thai food before but I love it now! Enjoyed the PadThai very much and anxious to get back and experiment with the menu. Good value."}
{"text":"You gotta eat this Thai Food!

Save yourself thousands and don't fly to Bangkok, just drive over to the Thai Food Corner, you won't be disappointed. 
I've been to Thailand and I've been eating here for nearly 20 years, it's spot on for classic Thai cuisine. This is a family owned and very simple restaurant just like you will find in Thailand.
I like the Pad Thai and my wife likes the House fried rice. 

Try it, you'll be back."}
{"text":"Been going there for over 10 years, even when they were at the other location. Friendly owners and great food.  Have taken out of town guests there and they said it was great food."}
{"text":"Totally a Mom & Pop joint. Mom took our order, Pop brought our drinks, and I think they both cooked our dinner. Pineapple fried rice, Won Tons, Panaugn curry and rice. Everything was fresh and tasty. The beef in my curry was slightly over cooked but the more I ate, the more I liked it. 
With lots of stuff on the menu to try, I think we finally found good local Thai food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I said I wanted mild, this is making me sweat. Inedibly salty. Terrible.  Yelp keeps telling me that my message is too short, so I'm going to babble about how much I am not impressed with this place. I won't be going back. I really wanted to keep this short...."}
{"text":"My favorite little Taiwan place.  #9 children soup is Laura favorite  mine would be about everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Outstanding mom & pop place! We are here at least 1-2 times per week. Well worth it. Suggest you don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Yellow Curry (chicken)
A+ flavor! Really good mix of spices. Really big portion of food!
Quick and pleasant service. 

Only reason for 4 stars is because the inside restraint is nothing special."}
{"text":"I've been going to Thai Food Corner since 2005. 

I'm a big fan of their Penang Curry Chicken, Pad Se Ew and Tom Ka Gai soup.

Service is always spot on, the food is consistently good and the prices are great.

If you are looking for a neighborhood style Thai food restaurant in east Mesa, Thai Food Corner should be on the top of your list."}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed.  The food was ok but not great. Took forever to get a cup of water & a Thai iced coffee and there was only 1 other table that had people at it (2).  I ordered the house fried rice & it did not have any vegetables in it or any basil.  Very bland.  It did have about 5 slivers of green onion."}
{"text":"I didn't think there were any Mom and Pop Thai shops in Mesa, but I was wrong. This quaint little places is nestled up in the corner, but definitely worth going to because of the quick meals and the accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Get the fried rice, the chow mein, and the hot and sour soup when u r feeling under the weather is all u need. Wonderful food even if the woman answering the phone is a little curt...Get over it and eat there."}
{"text":"Yum.  For a casual eatery this place is a top pick.  The curry is awesome & the noodles are great!  Prices are cheap & the owner is so helpful with suggestions when ordering.  He warned us about the spicy dishes but as it turned out he needn't worried,  the medium spicy was very good:  nice heat, good spice & completely yummy."}
{"text":"This place has excellent Thai food. Owners are friendly and enjoy chatting if you eat in. Most orders are take out. Lots and lots of regulars. They are great about modifying orders for preference or allergies. There are 4-5 things that I crave on a regular basis.

The location is basically a hole-in-the-wall. The first time I ate here I wasn't even sure it was open. It's in a basically defunct strip-mall."}
{"text":"First timer. The service was fairly prompt, as we ordered at the restaurant and waited. We ordered 6 meals ranging from Pad Thai, Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour and Green Curry. I would rate the food as average at best and would not plan to to return, as their has to be better Thai food elsewhere. The food was flavorless and just not up to expectation. 

Sad day!"}
{"text":"we have gone here probley 5 times or so and the best thing is it,s close to the house but the last visit we ordered a shrimp dish and it had 4 shrimp in it for 7.95ish pad thai was not very exciting and they never asked how spicy i would like it , i stoped after work i was brain dead and did not think to  mention it.luckily i had chili paste at home.I told my wife that we will need to venture a little farther for thai food from here on out"}
{"text":"when I was there, the owner was picking his bare feet at a table, the food was bland and tasteless. Water did not have 1 ice cube. The older lady was very unfriendly and the bathroom is thru the kitchen. Shut it down please"}
{"text":"My poor experience is a result of a take out order gone wrong.  The details of the ordeal are not much different than thousands of others you can read on Yelp, so I won't waste your time... man places order over the phone, man drives to pick up food, order is not correct and incomplete but man doesn't realize incorrect order until home, man is frustrated because of the inconvenience and that he even left the restaurant a tip, man calls restaurant to discuss incorrect and incomplete order, man gets excuses and is told by the guy on the phone that they were busy when my order was placed and that he \"didn't have time to listen to this\".  The next thing he did listen to was man hanging up the phone.

No, I'm not going to drive back to your restaurant to pick up all the things that were missing or wrong with my order.  No, I'm not going to drive back to your restaurant to figure out how to get a refund. Quite frankly, if you had simply apologized and acted like you gave a crap instead of telling me you didn't have time to listen to me explain how my order was wrong and doubled-down by added poor customer service to a mistake, I probably would have hung up unhappy but not pissed off."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We tried the yellow curry and the garlic chicken. Both of them were delicious. I also ordered a Thai tea and it's probably one of the best I've had! Very creamy and sweet. The food was not spicy at all, but I think you're able to ask for it? The staff was friendly and I have no complaints about the food or service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for basic Thai Food, at a place that isn't fancy this is a great choice."}
{"text":"... Fast forward to 2018 and this is still one of my favorite mom and pop shops!!! The food is always delicious and I love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time this week. I'm not a Thai food fan, but their Chinese inspired dishes on the menu made it easy for me to pick a dish I'd want. Usually we drive to Phoenix to Desert Jade, which is great Chinese food, but no Thai. My husband and son had the Yellow Curry and I had the Snow Pea Vegetables with Chicken in a garlic sauce. We also had wontons. Absolutely yummy food, no complaints from any of us. Loved the flavor of everything we ate. Vegetables were cooked perfectly, and curry had just the right amount of heat. Ice tea was excellent also. Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"A very good tiny Thai food place. Excellent dishes. Kind staff. Very reasonable prices. I really found this place through my sons who kept raving about it to me. Finally, I went.

I tried the Penang Chicken curry, Pad Thai, and cashew chicken dishes. The Penang chicken was especially unique and flavorful. All dishes are available in your choice of spiciness.

The owner/operator is a kindly man who is quick, courteous and always smiling when you come to the restaurant. I love supporting family businesses and this little treasure is the best Thai food I've been to in the Valley of the Sun. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't eat Thai food often, but I'm always anxious to try something different. Found myself in the area today for lunch and the 4 star review convinced me to give it a shot. I decided to try the Yellow Curry, which is almost like a stew (Chicken, potatoes, onion, carrots) served with a large side of rice. It was fantastic! Extremely flavorful. The cafe itself is really small, maybe 8 small tables or so. Felt almost like your Taiwanese neighbor was having you over for dinner. This is the \"hole in the wall\" type of place I love to find. I'd give it 5 stars, but I prefer a little better ambiance to make it perfect. Food, based on the dish I had, is 5 stars. Decor/ambiance is about 1 star. But it was clean and the staff were friendly, service was prompt. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was very good. It comes with just chicken, but they will do a beef/chicken/shrimp combo by request. The iced Thai Tea with cream was also delicious, better then other places I have tried ."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant. Family owned and operated. Not fancy but seriously the best Thai Food in town. All dishes are excellent. Out of the way."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the Pad Thai or the Veggies and Tofu both are excellent.  Also I think they make the best Won Ton Soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try some new Thai in the area. We chose Thai Food Corner based on the reviews. We were NOT disappointed. We ordered the Thai Toast, which we had no idea what to expect, and it was fabulous. It was served with their cucumber relish, which the whole dish is best when eaten all together. The Egg drop soup was decent. I chose the Pad Thai, mild (cause I'm a wimp) and it was fabulous. It has a great combination of chicken and veggies. My friend got the yellow curry which was equally as delicious. The portions are large and could easily be shared. Long story short, try this place it's delicious."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp or I would have never found this place. Walked in and placed an order at lunch, only waited 10 minutes. The guy was really friendly and speedy. I got the Paneang Curry, which was delicious but a bit spicier than I'd prefer. We also got Teriaki Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken, all great! It was about $10 per dish but they are huge portions. Can't wait to try some more dishes at this place!"}
{"text":"I love the food!  I've eaten here no less than a dozen times in the last couple of months and the food is consistently fantastic."}
{"text":"My absolute Go-To for Thai for 15+ years. The Basil Beef (green curry) is amazing. The spicy-hotness is exactly what I'm looking for... they can, of course, make it mild for the less adventurous. 

Conveniently located near my work. I'm here frequently.

The owners and staff are friendly and concerned about your experience. This a homey place tucked in the far Southeast corner (corner... just like the name says) of Brown and Higley roads.

While I've tried many other wonderful dishes here through family-style dining, I'm rigidly dedicated to my Basil Beef baby!

Stop in a find out which dish(es) inspire(s) your dedication. See that? Inspired use of parenthesis there. ;)"}
{"text":"This is hands-down one of my favorite Thai places. From Pad Woon Sen to Pad Thai, everything I've ever ordered has been delicious and the owners are very nice people! We love having this great little spot so close to our house."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Thai restaurant in the east valley! This place is amazing! We ordered green curry and pad khee mo. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a mom and pop place as another person mentioned. My family had the pad see ew, chicken satay, yellow curry, fried rice, and green curry.

The service was nice and prompt. We also had a few thai teas and they were incredible. We first ordered one, then two, then three. They were really that good. The food was overall really awesome. The chicken satay is an absolute must. It is so moist and flavorful, it was definitely the best chicken satay I've ever had. We also loved the yellow curry .The other three dishes were good, but I'm not certain I would order them again. That being said, I definitely want to come back and order other things! There are not a lot of great Thai restaurants in Mesa. This won't be the best Thai food in the world by any means, but it is definitely one of the best in East Mesa. I will certainly be back and recommend the chicken satay and the yellow curry. I don't like Thai food really at all, but could eat those two dishes for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Thai food!! A small family owned place where you truly feel like family. This place is a tiny restaurant with limited seating, but the food is excellent! The service is always very warm and friendly. The only issue with this place is that they close at different times during the day and open for dinner or lunch at varied times so be sure to double check hours before you go."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food. The pad thai, thai fried rice, and pineapple fried rice are all excellent."}
{"text":"had lunch today with colleagues from out of town. 3rd time eating here and we'll be back. very attentive service. above average food selection and quality. mostly authentic. clean rest room. clean dining room. good parking.."}
{"text":"We have loved TFC since before they were TFC. If you have no idea what you want, just ask them to surprise you, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Corner Thai was recommended to our family by our 96 year old neighbor, Doris Hoover. She loves the pepper beef and the cashew chicken. I am a diehard Pad Thai eater; my go to dish when visiting a new Thai restaurant , and this restaurant did not disappoint . I find the green curry exceptionally good. My friends have tried the sweet and sour chicken, cooked two ways, crispy or stir fried, and both have been perfect. I think, the nice thing about this restaurant, is that they don't over use the sauces. The different ingredients in the dish are able to speak for themselves, and this is quite nice. We have been to this restaurant several times over the past year. Always consistent. Always a good value. Always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"My second day here for lunch; yesterday I had the Pad Thai with chicken and today Thai fried rice with beef.  Both were okay not super delicious, very dry as well.  

The service sucks badly, which is the primary reason why I'm giving it a 3 stars...the lady, also the owner, could improve her attitude and provide a better service. 

Don't think I would return here again..."}
{"text":"Satisfying and delicious. Sam is incredibly hospitable. The tom yum gai soup hit the spot citrusy tasty. The house fried rice and pad thai are the best around. This little gem of a place completely hit a home run. Not fancy mind you but homey. We were shown videos of a grand daughter in Thailand... how welcoming and home feeling. 
The home made chili sauce made me sweat with pure happiness. Just the thing i needed after the week i had. I cant say enough about the service and hospitality.. i am a fan!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place! And we are both picky with our Thai food. Very fresh and super yummy!!"}
{"text":"I am pretty surprised about this mom & pop thai food place. My hubby and I moved to the area earlier this year and we loved our Thai food takeout place in Scottsdale. After ready many reviews we decided to try this place out. Once entering the place looked cluttered with tons and tons of books and magazines. I wasn't sure if I stepped into a library or a restaurant. The friendly owner handed our order and I was on our way home. We ordered the shrimp pad thai and crab puffs. WOW WOW WOW!!! The pad thai was perfectly cooked. My hubby and I ate the entire order and let me tell you there was plenty of it. The crab puffs where crunchy on the outside and delicious warm cream cheese gooey filling on the inside.
We will definitely be coming back as we now have found our Thai take out place."}
{"text":"I am feeling rather generous and hence an extra star for this establishment. Mom and pop .. me support so A-OK rating. I always order Woon sen (Glass noodles) with whatever I feel like having that made into (Pad thai, Pad etc) 

This place has been a hit or miss (miss mostly), hence probably why it is never very crowded (or it could be the remote location)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic \"hole in the wall\" Thai food restaurant, this is it.  I have had trendy, contemporary Thai places, but none of them are as real as this."}
{"text":"Thai Food Corner is a new quaint little place near work.  I was inquiring about some of my favorite dishes, and they didn't make it with chicken, but with pork instead.  That was the first bad sign.  I ordered my food medium spice, and it was spicy as heck with green chili and red chili pepper seeds.  I have had Thai medium many places, and it has never been this hot.  Be careful how you order here."}
